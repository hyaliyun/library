It is the main hospital of the Parkland Health & Hospital System and serves as Dallas County's public hospital. It is located within the Southwestern Medical District. History The original hospital opened in 1894 in a wooden building on a meadow located at Oak Lawn Avenue and Maple. The name Parkland came from the land on which the hospital was built, originally purchased by the city as a park. A brick building (the first hospital brick building erected in Texas, now owned by Crow Holdings) replaced the wooden facility in 1913. In 1954, Parkland moved to 5201 Harry Hines Boulevard about a mile from its original site. On August 20, 2015, Parkland opened a new emergency department and began accepting patients. Staff members and patients were transferred throughout the next few days, from 5201 Harry Hines Boulevard to the new hospital located across the street at 5200 Harry Hines Boulevard. The new hospital welcomed its first birth, a boy delivered by Caesarean section, that same morning. =John F. Kennedy assassination= The John F. Kennedy plaque in Parkland's Radiology Department marks the location of the Trauma Room I bed in 1963.Parkland is best known as the hospital where four individuals associated with the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy either died or were pronounced dead: President Kennedy himself, his assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby who later killed Oswald, and Abraham Zapruder, who had filmed Kennedy‘ s assassination. The 2013 film Parkland dramatizes the deaths of Kennedy and Oswald in the hospital. After he was shot on November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was rushed to Parkland, where he was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. in Trauma Room 1, 30 minutes after he was shot at Dealey Plaza. At the same time, Texas governor John Connally, wounded in the same shooting, was treated in Trauma Room 2, and survived. Two days after the assassination, November 24, Oswald was rushed to Parkland after being shot in the abdomen by Ruby and died in operating room #5 after over 90 minutes of surgery. Ruby died on January 3, 1967 in the same emergency department, from a pulmonary embolism associated with lung cancer. Then, on August 30, 1970, Zapruder also died at Parkland. Since Ruby's death in 1967, areas where Kennedy was pronounced dead and Oswald was operated on have been remodeled. A plaque there marks the location where Trauma Room 1 was previously in the prior Parkland. Parkland's JFK history wall is noted at the new hospital. Awards and recognition Parkland has been recognized as one of the nation's Most Wired™ Hospitals for excellence in using technology to fill gaps in care, provide services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and expand access to medical specialists. The hospital received this recognition 2014–2017. Parkland was awarded The Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval® and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association's Heart-Check mark in 2017 for Advanced Certification for Comprehensive Stroke Centers. In 2017, Parkland Health & Hospital System was recognized as a Top Performer in LGBT Healthcare Equality by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation, the educational arm of the country's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights organization. Parkland earned top marks in meeting non-discrimination and training criteria that demonstrate its commitment to equitable, inclusive care for LGBT patients and their families. Leadership In May 2017, Fred Cerise, MD, MPH, president and CEO of Parkland Health & Hospital System was appointed by the U.S. Comptroller General to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC). As a member of the commission, Dr. Cerise serves as a national advisor to Congress on issues affecting Medicaid and CHIP. Parkland Trauma Department In 2016, the staff of Parkland's Rees-Jones Trauma Center began an initiative to teach classes to the community members so that they can learn how to recognize life-threatening bleeding and administer appropriate medical treatment before professional rescuers arrive. Parkland \\"Stop the Bleed\\" classes have been adapted from courses including the U.S. Military's Tactical combat Casualty Care Guidelines and the Prehospital trauma Life Support (PHTLS) course and a part of a large, United States Government effort to make \\"Stop the Bleed\\" training the CPR of the 21st century. The staff of Parkland Memorial Hospital's Emergency Department and Rees-Jones Trauma Center received the 2016 Texas Preparedness Leadership Award for \\"Outstanding Service in Response to the 2016 Dallas Police Shootings.\\" The award was presented at the 2016 Preparedness Coalition Symposium held Oct. 12–14 in Galveston. Capabilities Parkland is the Dallas County public hospital; funds are primarily provided by a specially designated property tax on Dallas County residents. Parkland serves as one of Dallas's four Level I Trauma Centers (alongside Baylor University Medical Center, Methodist Dallas Medical Center, and Children's Medical Center), a primary care center for Dallas County residents, and (along with UT Southwestern) as a medical and surgical referral center for North Texas and parts of Southern Oklahoma. Thus, virtually all medical and surgical subspecialties are represented—which makes Parkland a destination for post-graduate medical training. The Parkland Burn Center, one of the largest civilian burn units in the U.S., is famous for the Parkland Formula for fluid resuscitation, developed by Charles R. Baxter in the 1960s. The fame of the Parkland formula is due to its being one of the first treatments for burn that included rehydration and electrolytic management. Parkland ranks among the largest teaching hospitals in the nation. Texas Woman's University began its Bachelor of Science nursing program at Parkland in 1954 and it is still located within walking distance of the Parkland campus. Parkland also serves as the major teaching hospital of the adjacent University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. It has the distinction of delivering more infants under one roof than any other hospital in the nation, averaging 15–16,000 deliveries per year. Parkland Memorial has eleven prenatal clinics and employs 72 doctors training to become obstetricians-gynecologists and 45 nurse-midwives. In 2005, the staff delivered 15,590 babies, an average of more than 42 infants per day.Dallas Morning News Parkland created one of the first high-risk antenatal units in the nation and had the first neonatal intensive care unit in North Texas. Parkland has approximately 240,000 emergency visits a year, for the co-located main emergency department (153,915 visits in 2013), and the urgent care unit (60,013 visits in 2013). Parkland is also the base for Biotel, the medical direction system used by Dallas Fire-Rescue as well as fourteen other emergency medical service agencies in the Metroplex. New Parkland Hospital Parkland Memorial new hospital building dedicated in 2015 Parkland's high volume of patients led to the decision by the Dallas County Commissioners Court to propose replacing the overcrowded, 50+-year-old building with a new , 17-story, 862-bed facility, along with a new outpatient center, a office facility, and parking for 6,000 cars. The total cost would be $1.27 billion, to be paid for through three avenues: 1) a $747 million bond proposition (contingent on voter approval, which was obtained in November 2008), 2) $350 million of cash from current and future operations, and 3) $150 million from private donations. The board approved nearly $100 million in contracts and hired two architectural firms – HDR, Inc. (based in Omaha, Nebraska, but operates a large practice in Dallas) and Corgan Associates Inc. (based in Dallas) – to design the new building. (A parking garage was completed as a design/build project by Whiting-Turner Construction and the architecture firm of Omniplan in January 2012.) One major feature of the new facility is that movements of staff and supplies are handled in separate corridors and elevators from those used by patients and visitors. The formal groundbreaking ceremony was held in October 2010; the facility was officially dedicated in March 2015, with all patients and staff officially occupying the facility that August. The new facility is immediately across Harry Hines Boulevard from the former hospital complex, and is served by the Medical District station of DART light rail, which opened in December 2010. In addition to Dallas County taxpayers funding the public hospital, large private donations were made as well, over the next five years; one major donation of $1 million was made by the Bank of America Charitable Foundation. Donors have their names permanently etched in glass panels in the two-story, glass atrium main lobby. Hatcher Station Health Center In May, 2014, a new 44,300-square-foot, Parkland Health & Hospital System-affiliated outpatient clinic near Fair Park began construction on a 7-acre site adjacent to DART's Hatcher Station. The $19.8 million clinic, which was designed by BOKA Powell for Frazier Revitalization Inc. and Parkland Health & Hospital System, serves geriatric and behavioral health patients, along with adults, women, children, and infants. It also provides on-site diagnostic imaging and lab services. Exam rooms feature flexible equipment setups, and an on-site conference facility accommodates education and wellness programs. The clinic, officially named Hatcher Station Health Center, opened on May 19, 2015. Psychiatric emergency room Abuse of patients in the hospital's psychiatric emergency room has been documented and brought about federal oversight of the hospital. On March 16, 2014, a nurse forced a roll of toilet paper into the mouth of a patient who had spit at him. Texas health authorities investigated the incident and found that Parkland was in \\"substantial compliance\\" with federal Medicare regulations in late 2014.

Although most odd-numbered U.S. routes are north–south, US 33 is labeled east–west throughout its route, except in Indiana where it is labeled north–south. It roughly follows a historic trail used by Native Americans from Chesapeake Bay to Lake Michigan. As of 2018, the highway's northern terminus is at U.S. Highway 20 in southeastern Elkhart, Indiana, although it once extended to St. Joseph, Michigan, and even to Lake Michigan Beach, Michigan. Until 1998, the route extended northward through South Bend, Indiana, to Niles. Its current eastern (or southern) terminus is Richmond, Virginia. Virginia State Route 33 then continues eastward through West Point to Stingray Point, on the Middle Peninsula and Chesapeake Bay near Deltaville, Virginia. Part of US 33 was created in conjunction with the Blue and Gray Trail in 1938 in order to promote a direct and scenic route between the Great Lakes and Virginia's historic Tidewater region. Route description =Indiana= Until the 2008 truncation, between South Bend and Fort Wayne, US 33 was part of the Lincoln Highway, and some road signage still refers to \\"Lincolnway\\". From its new terminus at US 20 on the southeast side of Elkhart, US 33 is a winding road that cuts diagonally from northwest to southeast through Northeast Indiana and serves as Main Street or a portion of Main Street in several cities and towns, including Elkhart, Dunlap, and Churubusco. The road is the main overland link between the Fort Wayne metropolitan area and South Bend metropolitan statistical areas. Until shortly after the Black Hawk War, Fort Wayne had been a major settlement, then a trading post and U.S. Army outpost in the Indiana Territory. From Elkhart, U.S. 33 continues southeast passing through the suburbs of Dunlap and Midway before crossing State Road 15 and State Road 4, then continues southeast toward Benton as Lincolnway East. Southeast of Benton, U.S. 33 intersects State Road 13 before joining with US 6 to become an east–west rural highway running for a few miles between just north of Lake Wawasee near Syracuse to Ligonier at the intersection of State Road 5, where US 33 splits from US 6 and turns south, joining SR 5 as a north–south road for a few miles before splitting off to the southeast toward Kimmell as it enters Noble County. US 33 continues southeast through Noble County until it reaches Wolf Lake, where it serves as the northern terminus of State Road 109 before continuing until its intersection with State Road 9 at Merriam just north of the Whitley County line. In Whitley County, the road curves eastward to bypass Blue Lake before intersecting with State Road 205 in Churubusco near the county line with Allen County as it heads toward Fort Wayne. On the west side of Fort Wayne, US 33 joins US 30 near Interstate 69, then follows the interstate south, intersecting with SR 14 and US 24 before turning east to follow the Interstate 469 bypass around the southwest side of Fort Wayne. At the intersection with SR 1 south of the Fort Wayne International Airport, I-469/US 33 turns to the northeast until it intersects US 27 at the Fort Wayne suburb of Hessen Cassel, where US 33 splits off to the southeast to follow US 27 as a combined highway toward Decatur. At Decatur, US 33/US 27 becomes a north–south road before it intersects with US 224 and continues as such until US 33 splits off from US 27 south of Decatur and heads east toward the Ohio state line, intersecting SR 101 at Pleasant Mills along the way. =Ohio= In Ohio, the highway runs at a generally southeast-northwest angle from the west- central to the southeastern part of the state, passing through mostly rural territory except for a significant portion running through downtown Columbus. Most of the route in the state, particularly east of Columbus, is expressway. The highway crosses over the Ravenswood Bridge into West Virginia. =West Virginia= View west along US 33 in Pendleton County, West Virginia US 33 extends in West Virginia, from the Ohio River at Ravenswood to the Virginia state line atop Shenandoah Mountain west of Harrisonburg, Virginia. Shortly after entering West Virginia and crossing the Ohio River, US 33 turns south, joining Interstate 77 to Ripley. The route then turns east from I-77, joining US 119 at Spencer, then passing through extremely rural areas of Roane, Calhoun, Gilmer, and Lewis counties. US 33 Intersects Interstate 79 at Weston, West Virginia. From Interstate 79 east, US 33 is a four-lane highway, part of Corridor H of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The four-lane segment continues on through rural areas of Upshur, and Randolph counties, to just a couple miles past Elkins. At Harding, US 250 joins US 33 for several miles after Elkins, where US 33 joins SR 55 and returns to a two-lane road, except for a seven-mile (11 km) section of four-lane across Kelly Mountain between Canfield and Bowden. Passing through the Monongahela National Forest, US 33 crosses the Eastern Continental Divide between Harman and Onego at about elevation, entering Pendleton County, then descends the Allegheny Front along Seneca Creek, skirting the north end of Spruce Mountain, at the highest point of the Allegheny Mountains. US 33 then joins SR 28 at Seneca Rocks, West Virginia, and continues south in the Potomac River headwaters through scenic forest and farmland landscapes. Turning eastward from SR 28 at Judy Gap, US 33 crosses North Fork Mountain at about , with a turnout on the western slope offering a scenic view of the Germany Valley below and the more distant Allegheny Front from Spruce Knob to Dolly Sods. US 220 joins US 33 for about half a mile in Franklin. After Franklin, US 33 continues eastward through rural areas, then climbs steeply to cross Shenandoah Mountain at Dry River Gap at about into Rockingham County, Virginia. =Virginia= View east along US 33 just after entering Virginia from West Virginia in Rockingham County U.S. Route 33 extends in Virginia from the West Virginia state line west of Harrisonburg across the Shenandoah Valley, Blue Ridge Mountains, and Atlantic Piedmont to Richmond. It enters Virginia from west Virginia on Shenandoah Mountain. After going down the mountain, it passes through the unincorporated community of Rawley Springs. After travelling 9 miles from Rawley Springs, reaches the Independent city of Harrisonburg and intersects major routes Virginia State Route 42, U.S. Route 11, and Interstate 81 before leaving the city. The 4-lane highway passes around the southernmost end of Massanutten Mountain, towards Elkton. There, it intersects U.S. Route 340, one of the only business routes of the entire U.S. Route has is also in the town. From Richmond, \\"Route 33\\" continues east as Virginia State Route 33 across the Atlantic coastal plain through the Tidewater region of the Middle Peninsula to reach the Chesapeake Bay at Stingray Point just east of Deltaville. History The US 33 designation was established January 1, 1938; it and the Blue and Gray Trail were dedicated on May 2 of that year in multiple ceremonies. At the time, US 33 extended into the state of Michigan near Niles up to a terminus in St. Joseph, following US 31 in the Great Lakes State. In November 1960, US 33 was extended to a junction with I-196/US 31 near Lake Michigan Beach, north of St. Joseph. In 1986, the highway was truncated south of Niles to the junction with US 12. In April 1998, it was truncated again to Elkhart, Indiana. Before its second truncation in 2008, it passed through Mishawaka and South Bend. Former segments of US 33 are now known as M-63, M-139, M-51, and State Road 933. Various segments of US 33 have been improved to limited-access freeways. These include Ohio segments from St. Marys to Wapakoneta; Huntsville (near Bellefontaine) to Dublin (a northwestern suburb of Columbus); and bypasses around Lancaster, Nelsonville, and Pomeroy. In West Virginia, US 33 from Interstate 79 near Weston east nearly to Elkins is four- lane, built as part of Corridor H of the Appalachian Development Highway System.

According to these sources he was granted rulership over Uppland as a vassal king under his uncle Harald Wartooth. Later he would take up arms against his uncle Harald in a bid to overthrow him and take the crown of Denmark, a conflict which Sigurd eventually won after the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, where it is said that Odin himself intervened and killed Harald. In the Sagas Sigurd is also known for being the father of the Norse Viking hero and legendary king of Denmark and Sweden, Ragnar Lodbrok. According to Bósa saga ok Herrauds, there was once a saga on Sigurd Ring, but this saga is now lost.Nerman (1925), p. 250. J. Butler, \\"The real Ragnar Lodbrok\\", Historic UK. Hervarar saga The Hervarar saga tells that when the Danish tributary king Valdar died, his son Randver became the king of Denmark, while his older brother Harald Wartooth took royal titles in Gautland. Then Harald subjugated all the territories once ruled by his maternal grandfather Ivar Vidfamne (Sweden, Denmark, Curonia, Saxony, Estonia, Gardarike, Northumberland). After Randver's death in battle in England, his son Sigurd Ring became the king of Denmark, presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd Ring and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd Ring ruled Denmark until his death and was succeeded by his son Ragnar Lodbrok. Harald Wartooth, however, had a son called Eysteinn Illruler who ruled Sweden until he was killed by Björn Ironside, a son of Ragnar Lodbrok.Ellehøj (1965), p. 88-93; Tolkien & Turville-Petre (1956), p. 68, Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum In Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, Ring (mostly mentioned without the name element Sigurd) is the paternal nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth, and presumably (the part of Sögubrot where this would have been narrated expressly has not been preserved) the son of Randver, who in his turn is the son of Harald's mother Auðr the Deep-Minded and her husband king Raðbarðr of Gardariki. Harald Wartooth was beginning to feel old, so he made Ring the king of Uppland, with the commission to rule Sweden and Västergötland. When Harald reached the extraordinary age of 150, he desired to die like a king in battle, and therefore challenged Ring to meet him in the field. Ring gathered manpower from Sweden, Västergötland and Norway and marched his troops by land and sea to the plain of Brávellir beneath the forest of Kolmården, close to the Bråviken bay. There he was met by the multi- ethic army of Harald, and the colossal Battle of Brávellir followed. In the end Ring beat his uncle, who was bludgeoned to death in the desperate fighting, and became the ruler of Denmark as well. He put an jarl in charge of Skåne and made a shieldmaiden the ruler of the rest of Denmark (cf. Chronicon Lethrense, below).Nerman (1925), p. 246-8. Sigurd Ring (as he is now called in the text) married Alfhild, the daughter of king Alf of Álfheimr and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. As Sigurd grew old, distant parts of his realm began to secede, and it is told how he lost territory in England due to old age. A certain Adalbrikt (Æthelberht) took possession of Northumbria and was succeeded by his sons Ama and Ælla. One day, Sigurd was in Västergötland and was visited by his in-laws, the sons of Gandalf. They asked him to join them in attacking king Eysteinn of Vestfold in Norway. In Vestfold, there were great blóts held at Skiringssal. Unfortunately, Sögubrot (meaning the \\"fragment\\") ends there. However, the Skjöldunga saga is believed to be the original story on which Sögubrot is based and it continues the story (see below).Nerman (1925), p. 257-8. Olaf Tryggvason's saga  According to the extended Saga of Olaf Tryggvason, Sigurd Ring, after having stabilized his Swedish-Danish realm, recalled the lands in England once ruled by Harald Wartooth and Ivar Vidfamne. This territory was now ruled by Ingjald (Ingild), a brother of King Peter of Wessex and a mighty ruler in his own right. Ring therefore summoned the leiðangr and sailed to the west, reaching Northumbria. As Ingjald learned about the invasion, he gathered an army. In the ensuing battle, Ingjald and his son Ubbe (Eoppa) fell with a large part of their army. Ring now subordinated Northumbria and made Olaf Kinriksson tributary king. He was a grandnephew of Moald Digra, the mother of Ivar Vidfamne. Ring sailed back to his Nordic kingdom and Olaf reigned for a long time. Then, however, Eava (Eafa), the son of Ubbe, claimed the kingdom. Olaf was defeated and fled to his suzerain in Svíþióð. As compensation, Ring installed Olaf as sub-king in Jutland. As such he served Ring and later Ragnar Lodbrok. His descendants Grim, Audulf and Gorm (I) the Childless also ruled in Jutland. Gorm I adopted the foundling Knud, whose son Gorm II was the foster father of Hardeknud I, ancestor of the later Danish kings.Saga Ólafs, Chapter 61, p. 110-1. The saga refers to names found in Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies, ancestors of Ecgberht, King of Wessex.Neither Ingild (d. 718), Olaf or Eafa are historically known to have reigned in Northumbria; Truhart (1988), Vol. III-2, p. 3549. Ingild's brother was King Ine of Wessex. Skjöldunga saga The Skjöldunga saga tells that Sigurd Ring was married to Alfhild, the daughter of king Alf of Alfheim, and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. Unfortunately, Alfhild died. When Sigurd Ring was an old man, he came to Skiringssal to take part in the great blóts. There he spotted a very beautiful girl named Alfsol, and she was the daughter of King Alf of Vendel (Vendel). The girl's two brothers refused to allow Sigurd to marry her. Sigurd fought with the brothers and killed them, but their sister had been given poison by her brothers so that Sigurd could never have her. When her corpse was carried to Sigurd, he went aboard a large ship where he placed Alvsol and her brothers. Then, he steered the ship with full sails out on the sea, as the ship burnt.Nerman (1925), p. 258-9. Ragnar Lodbrok succeeded his father, but put a subking on the throne of Sweden, king Eysteinn Beli, who later was killed by Ragnar's sons. Gesta Danorum According to Gesta Danorum (book 7), by Saxo Grammaticus, Ring was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald and the maternal nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth. His father Ingjald had ravished the sister of Harald, resulting in an indecisive spate of warfare. In the end Harald accepted the abduction in order preserve the friendship with Ingjald.Saxo Grammaticus (1905), p. 459. Ring fought with Harald Wartooth in the Battle of the Brávellir and became the overlord of Denmark as well. He appointed his cousin Ale the Strong as sub- king in Skåne while entrusting the shieldmaiden Hetha with the rest of the Danish lands.Saxo Grammaticus (1905), p. 482-3. Saxo then describes the different subkings and their adventures. Fourteen Danish kings later, in book 9, Saxo presents a Sigurd Ring as Siwardus, surnamed Ring. This king, however, bears no resemblance to the victor of Brávellir. Rather, he is the son of a Norwegian chief Sigurd and the maternal grandson of the historical King Götrik (i.e. Gudfred, d. 810). Backed by the men of Zealand and Skåne, he fights a civil war against his cousin Ring. As the two rivals join battle, they both fall. Sigurd Ring is the father of Ragnar Lodbrok who has been brought up in Norway during the civil war, but is now hailed as Danish ruler.Saxo Grammaticus (1905), p. 539-41. Other sources According to Hversu Noregr byggdist, Sigurd Ring is the son of Randver, the uterine brother of Harald Wartooth. Randver is the son of Raðbarðr while Harald is the son of Hrærekr slöngvanbaugi.Nerman (1925), p. 250. In the part of the Heimskringla called the Saga of Harald Fairhair, Harald Fairhair learns that the Swedish king Erik Eymundsson had enlarged Sweden westwards, until it reached the same extent as it had during king Sigurd Ring and his son Ragnar Lodbrok. This included Romerike, Westfold all the way to Grenmar, and Vingulmark.Nerman (1925), p. 259. In Ragnar Lodbrok's saga, it is mentioned that Sigurd Ring and Harald Wartooth fought in the Battle of the Brávellir and that Harald fell. After the battle Sigurd Ring was the king of Denmark, and he was the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.Ragnars Saga Lodbrokar , p. 12. Ragnarssona þáttr only states that Ring was the king of Sweden and Denmark, and the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok and His Sons In Bósa saga ok Herrauds, it is only said that Sigurd Ring, the father of Ragnar Lodbrok fought with Harald Wartooth at the Battle of the Brávellir where Harald died. It adds that there was a saga on Sigurd Ring (which today no longer exists).Nerman (1925), p. 249-50. According to the Chronicon Lethrense, Harald Wartooth had made all the countries down to the Mediterranean pay tribute. However, when he went to Sweden to demand tribute, the Swedish king Ring met him at the Battle of the Brávellir, and Harald lost and died. Ring made a shieldmaiden the ruler of Denmark (cf. Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, above).Nerman (1925), p. 250. Gríms saga loðinkinna and the younger version of Orvar-Odd's saga only mention Sigurd Ring in a few lines relating to the Battle of the Brávellir with Harald Wartooth.Nerman (1925), p. 250. In Norna-Gests þáttr, it is said that Sigurd Ring was very old when he sent his son-in-law, the son of Gandalf, to request the Gjukungs, Gunnar and Högne to pay tribute. This was promptly refused. The sons of Gandalf then asked Sigurd Ring to help them fight against the Gjukungs and their renowned ally Sigurd Fafnisbani. Sigurd Ring could not help them in person, as he was busy fighting against ravaging Curonians and Kœnir.Nerman (1925), p. 259. Battle was joined in Holstein but turned into a defeat for the Norse army, since Sigurd Fanisbane made the Norse champion Starkad flee in panic.The Story of Norna-Gest, Chapter 7 Historical origins It has been suggested that a report of a struggle for the Danish crown may have given rise to the legend of Sigurd Ring. Following the death of Hemming in 812, a civil war broke out between his brother or cousin Sigifridus and Anulo. This Anulo was the nephew or grandson (nepos) of an earlier king Harald. The rivals fought a battle for the succession in which both were killed.Jessen (1862), p. 13-29. The names Sigfred and Sigurd were often conflated in medieval texts. As for Anulo, the name might originally represent Old Norse Ánleifr or Áli, though it was misunderstood by medieval Scandinavian chroniclers as Latin annulus which means ring.Storm (1877), p. 396. Saxo Grammaticus and some other medieval compilers of king lists clearly combine the names Sigfred/Sigurd and Anulo/Ring into one person, having received knowledge of 9th century historical events from the chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075). Their historical successor Ragnfred (r. 812-813) is mixed up by Saxo with the Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok, who is identified as the son of Sigurd Ring.Storm (1877), p. 391-9. The Danish list of early Viking Age kings is therefore in part a High Medieval construction.Smyth (1977), p. 1-4. One possibility is thus that the struggle of 812 is reflected in the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, fought by Sigurd Ring, nephew of Harald Wartooth.Jessen (1862), p. 35. Other scholars have suggested that the original name of the ruler was Ring, that he was a historical king of the Swedes, and that he won a battle against a Danish or East Geatic host in the 8th century.Nerman (1925), p. 256-7, 261. Still others regard the battle as mythical or purely legendary.Reallexikon, Vol. 13 (1999), p. 645-7 Modern Swedish historians are skeptical to the prospects of establishing a chronology from the information of the High Medieval saga literature, and generally decline to discuss the possible historicity of Sigurd Ring or the Brávellir battle.Harrison (2002), p. 23. The name Ring occurs in the royal Swedish clan in the Viking Age, since the ecclesiastic chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075) says that a ruler in the first half of the 10th century bore that name.Harrison (2002), p. 72.

The BeIA system presents a browser-based interface to the user. The browser was based on the Opera 4.0 code base, and was named Wagner. Unlike the BeOS, which runs the Tracker and Deskbar at boot-up, the BeIA OS boots straight into the Opera browser interface (much like the later Google Chrome OS does with the Google Chrome browser). While it is possible to boot BeIA into an interface similar to the standard BeOS, doing so involves special knowledge. BeIA compression techniques The BeIA operating system employs a number of techniques to minimise the system footprint. These involve a number of pre processes which yield an installable file system image.BeIA compression patent United States Patent: 6883087 The CFS Filesystem was used to reduce the file system size. CFS (Compressed File System) was a file system created in house at Be Inc that aimed to compress the files within itself to save space. The filesystem had a similar set of properties to the native BeOS file system BFS, but some of the more advanced features (live queries and attributes) were either broken or non-functional in many of the Beta releases of the software. The BeOS uses ELF format executable files, much as many other operating systems. BeIA uses an extended version of ELF, the name of which is unknown but which has come to be known as CELF, from the CEL magic word within the executable header and the fact that it is derived from ELF format executables through a compression process. The CELF (Compressed ELF) files use a patented technique to compress the op codes within the executable and reduce the overall footprint of each executable file. The file was compressed by creating a set of dictionaries that contain the op codes and are read by the kernel at start up and mapped into the executable in memory at run time. This makes the file fast loading, but has an extreme disadvantage, in that the dictionary is not extendible by the user and adding extra executable was not possible when using CELF compression techniques unless the executable symbols existed within the dictionary already present. The creation of CELF executables is generally done in batch. The entire system will be compressed and a file system image created from the crushed files. Crushing was the term coined for the compression of the system using CELF format. BeIA can run either as CELF or ELF based. However, it can only use one or the other file formats. Versions The following BeIA versions were released to developers at stages of the development of the system. * Pre 1.0 build - reports to be 4.5.2, this is likely a hang over from the BeOS version. Pre numbering of BeIA. * 1.0 beta 9 (uncrushed binaries are compatible with Release Candidate) * 1.0 Release Candidate (circa the clipper) * 1.0 * 2.0 History BeIA is believed by many to be partially responsible for the death of Be, Inc., as sales were never anywhere near as high as anticipated.

The Nordic Bronze Age barrow gave its name to the location Håga (\\"the barrow\\") and is probably the source of the cognomen of the king, at Haugi (\\"at the barrow\\"). As a result, the mound was in the 17th/18th centuries erroneously named after the king. Björn at Haugi (\\"Björn at the Barrow\\" from the Old Norse word haugr meaning mound), Björn på Håga, Björn II or Bern was, according to Hervarar saga, a Swedish king and the son of Erik Björnsson, and Björn ruled together in diarchy with his brother Anund Uppsale. Björn at Haugi is sometimes identified with the real historical figure Björn, a local Swedish ruler mentioned in the 9th-century writings of Rimbert. The account of the Hervarar saga The Hervarar saga is an Icelandic work from the 13th century. At the end of a saga, a short chronicle of the Swedish kings from Ivar the Wide-Fathoming to Philip (d. 1118) has been appended, where Björn at Haugi is mentioned: This account dates king Björn to the first half of the 9th century, as his nephew Eric Anundsson was the contemporary of Harald Fairhair.Jónsson, Finnur (1890). \\"Om skjaldepoesien og de ældste skjalde\\", in Kock, Axel (Ed.). Arkiv för nordisk filologi, sjätte bandet. Ny följd: andra bandet. C.W.K. Gleerups förlag, Lund. p. 144. Landnámabók mentions a Swede named Þórðr knappr who was one of the first settlers in Iceland and whose father was called Björn at Haugi.The relevant page of Landnámabók in the English translation at Northvegr. Moreover, Björn and his court skald Bragi the Old are mentioned also in Skáldatal, where a second court skald also is mentioned, Erpr lútandi.Skáldatal.

The Icelandic scholar Jón Jóhannesson has argued that Björn at Haugi may in fact have been a petty ruler in Norway around the late 9th century, and is consequently not, as often hypothesized in older history writings, the same person as the Swedish king Bern (Björn) in the Vita Ansgarii who ruled around 829-830. The more original version of the Landnámabók seems to have contained two passages which associate Björn with persons from Sogn and Halogaland. Though evidence is not conclusive, Jóhannesson suggests that later tradition moved Björn from Norway (possibly Trondelag) to Svithiod due to certain legendary associations, or even since he had Swedish ancestry. The Icelanders may also have known about the Swedish Björn via the chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), and assimilated him with the king in Skáldatal and Landnámabók.Jóhannesson, Jón (1966-69) \\"Bjorn at Haugi\\", Saga-Book of the Viking Society 17, p. 293-301 See also * Early Swedish history Notes and references Category:Semi-legendary kings of Sweden Category:9th-century rulers in Europe Category:House of Munsö Category:9th-century Swedish people Category:Germanic pagans ","title":"Björn at Haugi"},{"id":"888760","text":"U.S. Route 34 (US 34) is an east–west United States highway that runs for from north-central Colorado to the western suburbs of Chicago. Through Rocky Mountain National Park it is known as the Trail Ridge Road where it reaches elevation , making it the third highest paved through highway in the United States. The highway's western terminus is Granby, Colorado at US 40\\\\. Its eastern terminus is in Berwyn, Illinois at Illinois Route 43 and Historic US 66. U.S. Route 34 becomes a toll road for a short distance in Colorado, where it passes through Rocky Mountain National Park. Route description View of US 34 in Rocky Mountain National Park, from an elevation above =Colorado= In the state of Colorado, U.S. Route 34 runs north from Granby through Rocky Mountain National Park. It passes through Estes Park, Loveland, and Greeley before entering Nebraska east of Wray. Within Rocky Mountain National Park US 34 is known as Trail Ridge Road. Due to its high elevation through the park and over the Continental Divide, Route 34 closes entirely in winter from the Colorado River Trailhead on the west (10 miles north of the Grand Lake entrance) to Many Parks Curve on the east (8 miles from the Estes Park entrance.) Closure runs roughly from mid-October to Memorial Day weekend in May, and can occur at any time in summer due to high alpine snow storms. Route 34 transverses Fall River Pass and Milner Pass in the Front Range of Colorado. =Nebraska= In the state of Nebraska, U.S. Route 34 is a major east-west arterial surface road along the southern portion of Nebraska. It enters Nebraska west of Haigler and overlaps other routes for the majority of its routing. U.S. 34 passes through Hastings, Grand Island, Seward, and Lincoln before entering Iowa east of Plattsmouth over the Plattsmouth Bridge. U.S. Route 34 from between Hastings and Grand Island is known as the Tom Osborne Expressway, which is named for the former Hastings resident, Nebraska Cornhuskers football coach, and Congressman. In Lincoln, U.S. 34 overlaps with Interstate 180 from its junction with Interstate 80 into downtown where it becomes North 9th/North 10th Streets, then east as \\"O\\" Street. Also, the segment from the Lancaster County/Cass County border to Nebraska Highway 1 south of Elmwood is the Bess Streeter Aldrich Memorial Highway, after the former author and Elmwood resident. =Iowa= US 34 near its junction with US 71, Montgomery County, Iowa. In the state of Iowa, U.S. Route 34 is a major east–west arterial surface road across southern Iowa. It enters Iowa west of Glenwood and then passes through Glenwood, Red Oak, Corning, and Creston before intersecting Interstate 35 at Osceola. East of Osceola, it continues through Chariton and Georgetown then onto Albia before meeting U.S. Route 63 at a traffic circle in Ottumwa. East of Ottumwa to Burlington, the highway overlaps Iowa Highway 163. This segment of highway is an expressway with some freeway segments. As of November 12, 2008, it bypasses Fairfield and then bypasses Mt. Pleasant, with a portion of this also concurrent with US-218 and Iowa 27, which is also the Iowa route for the Avenue of the Saints. It then continues southeast towards Burlington bypassing New London and then Danville and Middletown. The freeway segment through Burlington was completed in the 1970s. It then crosses the Mississippi River on the Great River Bridge into Illinois which was completed in the early 1990s. In 2015, a 15-mile segment of U.S. Route 34 in Montgomery and Adams counties won the Sheldon G. Hayes Award for the highest quality asphalt pavement in the nation. Much of this route was originally known as the Bluegrass Highway and parallels tracks of what was originally the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad and is now the BNSF. Amtrak's California Zephyr passenger rail service also parallels this route. U.S. 34 in the state of Iowa is officially designated the Red Bull Highway in honor of the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division. =Illinois= U.S. 34 in western Illinois In the state of Illinois, U.S. Route 34 enters at the Mississippi River across from Burlington, Iowa. It passes through or around the cities of Monmouth, Galesburg, Princeton, Mendota, Oswego, Aurora, Naperville, Lisle, Downers Grove, Westmont, Clarendon Hills, Hinsdale, Western Springs, La Grange, Brookfield, Lyons and Riverside and continues in a largely southwest-northeast direction to its eastern terminus at Illinois Route 43 and Historic US 66 in Berwyn. Through much of the Chicago area, the highway is known as \\"Ogden Avenue\\", after William Butler Ogden, Chicago's first mayor. The entire highway in Illinois is named the Walter Payton Memorial Highway after Pro Football Hall of Famer Walter Payton, who wore #34 for the Chicago Bears. The highway is 211.37 miles (340.17 km) long within the state. Future Nebraska and Iowa are planning a new U.S. Route 34 bridge which would reroute U.S. 34 north of the Platte River concurrent with U.S. 75, then turn east to cross the Missouri River south of Bellevue, Nebraska.US-34 Nebraska Approach Missouri River Bridge, Bellevue 34-7(118) It would then align with the current U.S. 34 alignment near Glenwood, Iowa.

Seasonal animal migration is very common in agricultural cycles. It includes migrations such as moving sheep or cattle to higher elevations during summer to escape the heat and find more forage. Human labor often moves with fruit harvest or to other crops that require manual picking. Seasonal agricultural migration While the culture of many crops (especially \\"dry\\" crops) has become entirely mechanized, others, such as fruits and vegetables, still require manual labor, at least for harvest, and some, such as tobacco, still need manual labor for its culture. Much of the work was once provided by family members or boarding students, but they are less available now, and farms are larger. Now, migratory workers provide much of the hand labor required in agriculture in the US and other countries. Labor contractors arrange with farmers to provide the necessary help at the seasonal time, often with foreign nationals whose employment opportunities are more limited in their home areas. A number of migratory contractors, known as \\"custom harvesters\\", move with their combines to follow the wheat harvest in the United States and Canada. as the season moves north. Some crop dusters are also migratory, following seasonal patterns of need. In the large citrus districts of Florida and California seasonal pickers arrive for collection periods and often move with the changing harvest. Most commercial beekeepers in the US are migratory, spending winter in warm climates and moving with the spring to follow the bloom, or pollination contracts for almonds, apples, blueberries and other fruits and vegetables that require bees. Migratory beekeeping also is practiced, especially in France, Australia, South Africa and Argentina.  Seasonal non-agricultural migration  The Vice-regal Lodge (Rashtrapati Niwas), Simla Some researchers suggest that snowbirds, Canadian and US citizens who move to warmer climates during the winter, exhibit patterns of seasonal migration. Although they are moving for non-agricultural reasons, they move with the seasons. For example, many residents of Ontario, Canada move to Florida, US during the winter. The practice actually dates back to colonial times, when Bostonians of means would often go (by sea) to Charleston or Savannah for winter. Later, the wealthy in the growing country maintained several seasonal residences and shifted residence with the seasons, to avail themselves of the best time to be at each location, and they named their time there \\"the season\\". In British India, Ceylon and Malaya, the cooler hill stations became the place of residence for Europeans during the hot summers, and Simla became the summer capital of the British Raj.

Kidd went on to manage such bands as Cheap Trick, The Damnwells and bandmate Kevin Tihista while working for New York-based Silent Partner Management. St. Clair joined the band Local H after stints as tour manager for Chicago's Liz Phair and served as drum tech for Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick. Triple Fast Action member Kevin Tihista released several of his own solo albums after the band's breakup. Triple Fast Action was one of many Chicago area acts signed to Capitol Records during the multi-year label frenzy that also snatched up the Smashing Pumpkins, Smoking Popes, Fig Dish, Loud Lucy, Veruca Salt, Red Red Meat, Certain Distant Suns, Liz Phair, The Lupins, Hum, Seam, Menthol, Urge Overkill, Stabbing Westward and Cupcakes among others. The band supported such notable acts as Everclear, Lenny Kravitz, The Wallflowers and Veruca Salt over the course of its existence. The band's first release, Broadcaster, was referred to as \\"Cheap Trick meets Nirvana\\" and featured power-pop two-toned guitar crunch and a stunning power backbeat. The album sold poorly despite extensive touring in the U.S. due to limited label support. The group left Capitol and signed with the then-NY-based indie label of John Szuch's (now based in Charlotte, NC) Deep Elm Records (Nada Surf, Brandtson, Pave the Rocket and Camber) to release the critically acclaimed Cattlemen Don't. The first single, \\"Heroes\\" received some college radio airplay and won several nights of local WKQX FM's battle of the songs. A farewell concert was performed at Chicago's Metro on May 24, 1998. Notable fans of the band include Dave Grohl of Nirvana/Foo Fighters, who lists a show of Rights of the Accused as his first concert.

Although the highway is physically southeast–northwest, it is nominally north–south. The highway's southern terminus is in Teays Valley, West Virginia, near Scott Depot, at Interstate 64 (I-64). Its northern terminus is near Michigan City, Indiana, at US 20\\\\. Currently, the West Virginia portion of the highway is being expanded to four lanes, mostly along a completely new route. The Ohio portion has been upgraded to a four-lane highway/freeway between the West Virginia state line and Trotwood, west of Dayton. Route description US 35 is signed north–south in West Virginia and Indiana, while in Ohio it is signed east–west. =West Virginia= View south along US 35 at CR 3/6 near Couch, West Virginia The entire length of US 35 in West Virginia is currently being expanded to a four-lane, mostly at-grade, expressway. In Putnam County, the roadway that becomes US 35 is a short, four- lane, divided, unsigned US 35 spur running northward from Teays Valley Road toward I-64 on the edge of Scott Depot in Teays Valley. Remaining on the edge of Scott Depot, and now at the edge of Teays Valley, the roadway reaches US 35's southern terminus at its junction with I-64, where the route becomes an expressway. US 35's junction with I-64 is a hybrid semi-directional T/diamond interchange. All movements between US 35 and I-64 are free-flowing, except for eastbound I-64 to northbound US 35\\\\. The interchange also handles movements between I-64 and the US 35 spur similar to a diamond interchange. Proceeding north from I-64, US 35 has two intersections, followed by an interchange with West Virginia Route 34 (WV 34). There follow a number of intersections along the route, with one being an indirect connection to WV 817, the former path of US 35\\\\. Approximately before the next major junction, US 35 becomes a two-lane route, which lasts for about . Along the two-lane section of US 35, the next major junction is WV 869, which travels across the Kanawha River on the Lower Buffalo Bridge (often referred to as the \\"Buffalo Bridge\\"), connecting via WV 62 to the town of Buffalo and the nearby, large Toyota engine and transmission plant. Next, there is an intersection with WV 817 south; the northbound state route joins US 35 in a concurrency. Farther north, in Mason County near Beech Hill, WV 817 north leaves the concurrency. Just after this intersection, the route once again becomes an expressway. Along the expressway section of US 35, the next major junction is WV 817 south; this marks the northernmost end of the state route carrying the former path of US 35\\\\. At WV 2, which leads to Point Pleasant, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with six ramps; all movements are free-flowing except for northbound US 35 to southbound WV 2, and from southbound WV 2 to southbound US 35; the interchange is partially in Henderson. At this point, US 35 becomes a freeway and remains so, as it immediately crosses the Ohio River on the Silver Memorial Bridge, and enters Ohio. =Ohio= US 35 is signed east–west in Ohio, an exception to the numbering scheme for US Highways, which calls for odd-numbered routes to be signed north–south, as is US 35 in West Virginia and Indiana. Continuing as a freeway, US 35 crosses the Ohio River from West Virginia on the Silver Memorial Bridge, and enters Gallia County, Ohio. The first, partial interchange, providing a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance, is with State Route 7 (SR 7), just outside the village of Gallipolis. Just after that, still outside the village, the highway passes adjacent to the Gallia–Meigs Regional Airport within Gallipolis; there is another partial interchange, providing an eastbound left exit and a westbound left entrance to SR 735, which connects to SR 7\\\\. From there, US 35 continues west, where there is a hybrid interchange with an unusual configuration at SR 160\\\\. SR 160 roughly parallels US 35 to the south; there is a westbound exit to SR 160 north which uses a flyunder ramp, an eastbound entrance from SR 160 south and an eastbound entrance from SR 160 north. Additionally, another flyunder ramp from SR 160 north merges with the westbound exit ramp; that exit ramp in turn splits to form an entrance ramp to westbound US 35\\\\. This interchange lacks an eastbound exit. As SR 160 turns north, it diverges from US 35, which travels somewhat northwest. There, US 35 once again meets SR 160, this time at a partial interchange with an eastbound exit and a westbound loop ramp entrance. Turning more west-northwest, there is an interchange at SR 850 (Rodney Pike), followed by a rest area in each direction. Approaching the edge of Rio Grande, the route turns west and then west-southwest, where there is an interchange at SR 325\\\\. Past the village, the highway travels northwest and becomes a four-lane, at-grade expressway when it reaches the Gallia County village of Centerville; here there is an intersection with SR 279 west. Traveling north-northwest and northwest into Jackson County, the expressway configuration continues until SR 327, where there is a grade-separated, one-quadrant interchange, with the connecting road in the southeast quadrant of the junction. The road resumes as an at-grade expressway, approaching and then skirting the edge of Jackson. The route then reaches a grade-separated, right-in/right-out interchange; westbound there is a right-in/right-out at Keystone Furnace Road; eastbound there is a right-in/right-out at McCarty Lane; these roads are connected via Industry Drive and Acy Avenue, which overpasses US 35\\\\. Next, there is an unusual interchange configuration at SR 32/SR 124, which is an expressway in both directions. Each highway has ramps that exit to the other highway, with traffic merging onto the second highway, but traffic coming to an intersection. Both highways end up having intersections, albeit with a grade separation of the main highway corridors. This interchange type is sometimes termed a \\"windmill\\" interchange, but it is not related to the interchange type of the same name. This junction is the only interchange of its type known to exist in the world. Soon after passing the last interchange and still skirting Jackson, the highway once again becomes a freeway and has an interchange at Pattonsville Road/Broadway Street. Turning briefly north, then northwest, the route leaves Jackson and reaches an interchange with SR 93\\\\. It next has an interchange with Jackson County Road 84 (Chillicothe Pike). After the last interchange, the highway becomes an at-grade expressway for about . Along this section, there is a rest area next to the westbound lanes but accessible from both directions, with additional access via Cain Road (Jackson Township Road 213). US 35 then turns roughly west, entering Ross County and reaching an interchange with Vigo Road/Watson Road at Richmond Dale. At this point the route again becomes a freeway. Turning north and northwest, the section between Richmond Dale and Chillicothe includes a large cut through a ridge and provides westbound motorists with a panoramic view of the Scioto River valley. Southeast of Chillicothe, westbound US 50 joins US 35 in a concurrency at a hybrid interchange; similar to a diamond interchange, the exit ramp from US 35 east carrying US 50 east becomes a two-way road, curves around and crosses over US 35 about east; the other ramps connect to this overpass. Next, US 50 west leaves the concurrency at a partial interchange at Eastern Avenue; there is only a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance. Then, the US 23 north freeway joins US 35 in a concurrency at a partial-Y interchange; there is an eastbound exit and a westbound left entrance. Turning north-northwest, US 35 skirts Chillicothe to the east, coming to an interchange at Main Street. Turning northwest, the US 23 north freeway leaves the concurrency at a partial-Y interchange; there is a westbound exit and an eastbound left entrance. Turning west and skirting through city boundaries, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with five ramps at SR 159 (Bridge Street); there is a loop ramp from northbound Bridge Street and a directional ramp from southbound Bridge Street to westbound US 35\\\\. Travelers eastbound near this interchange can see the hills that are shown on the Great Seal of the State of Ohio. Turning northwest, just outside the city limits, there is an interchange at SR 104 (High Street). The next, partial interchange, is at Pleasant Valley Road/Egypt Pike with a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance (via Larrick Lane). Continuing along, there is an interchange at Ross County Road 550/Pleasant Valley; despite this junction being a regular service interchange, it is configured as a hybrid trumpet interchange. Next is an interchange at Ross County Road 87, near Frankfort. Continuing, there is an interchange at SR 138\\\\. Entering Fayette County, the road turns west–northwest, bypassing south of Washington Court House. The next major junction is with I-71 near Jeffersonville; rather than have a direct interchange, each freeway indirectly connects to the other via interchanges with SR 435\\\\. As the route continues through flat farmlands, it enters Greene County, bypasses north of Jamestown and south of Xenia. Past the Xenia bypass, the road reverts to an at-grade expressway. US 35 once again returns to freeway status at the North Fairfield Road interchange in Beavercreek. It next has a full-access interchange with I-675, also in Beavercreek. Several miles later, in Montgomery County, the road opens into a three-lane highway (with five lanes in some parts) each way through downtown Dayton. Turning west, the highway has a full-access interchange with I-75 in downtown Dayton. Past I-75, the route becomes an expressway, with a mix of interchanges and at-grade intersections. After entering Drexel, just west of Dayton, the highway turns north. At the border with Trotwood, the route turns due west on West Third Street/Eaton Pike; the roadway that had carried US 35 continues as at-grade expressway SR 49 (the \\"Northwest Connector\\" or the \\"Trotwood Connector\\"). The roadway carrying US 35, now two lanes and undivided, travels through New Lebanon as Main Street. US 35 then enters Preble County and travels through West Alexandria as Dayton Street. The route next proceeds to Eaton; after passing through downtown as Main Street, the route turns northwest onto Eaton Richmond Pike (Main Street continues as SR 122). The highway travels toward I-70 near New Paris, widens to four lanes as it approaches SR 320, turns north and briefly becomes four lanes undivided, then reduces to single-lane ramps and merges with the Interstate at a partial interchange. Running concurrently with I-70, US 35 travels approximately to the Indiana state line. The portion of US 35 from Drexel to SR 320 is the only two-lane, undivided section of the route remaining in Ohio. US 35 is a major Appalachian Development Highway System Corridor linking I-70 and points west to I-64 and points east. The portion of the route within Gallia County is designated the \\"Bob Evans Highway\\", in honor of the restaurateur and pork sausage marketer who spent most of his life in the county. The portion of the route between Gallipolis and Jackson is designated as part of the Welsh Scenic Byway by the Ohio Department of Transportation, celebrating Welsh immigrants who settled in southeastern Ohio during the 19th century. The portion of the route in Dayton west of I-75 is designated the \\"C. J. McLin Jr. Parkway\\", in honor of the late state representative who advocated for and worked toward the construction of \\"US 35 West\\". =Indiana= US 35 enters Wayne County, Indiana with I-70 and passes north of Richmond, before splitting off on the northwest side of Richmond. US 35 then travels in a northwesterly path as a winding two-lane highway, passing through agricultural land, and through intersections with State Road 38 (SR 38), SR 1 and, in Randolph County, US 36\\\\. The highway then passes through a corner of Henry County, with no major junctions. In Delaware County, the highway reaches the edge of the city of Muncie, where it merges with SR 3 and SR 67 as a four-lane expressway. The expressway heads north, skirting the east side of Muncie, passing over the White River and through interchanges with Memorial Drive in unincorporated Center Township and SR 32 in Muncie. Continuing along the east edge of Muncie, there is a right- in/right-out intersection in both directions with East Centennial Avenue and an intersection with East McGalliard Road. Northeast of Muncie, at the border of unincorporated Center Township and Hamilton Township, there is an intersection with East Riggin Road. Shortly thereafter, SR 67 splits off the expressway at an interchange, followed by a partial interchange with Old State Road 3, leading back into Muncie. Soon after the expressway ends, with the roadway becoming a two-lane highway. Near the town of Royerton, US 35 turns west onto SR 28, toward I-69, as SR 3 continues north. After a short overlap with SR 28, US 35 turns north onto I-69. US 35 overlaps I-69, passing into Grant County, through an interchange with SR 26, to SR 22, where US 35 leaves I-69 and heads west on SR 22 to travel through the cities of Gas City and, in Howard County, Greentown. Just east of Kokomo, US 35 turns north onto the US 31 freeway. It overlaps US 31 for only , to a partial interchange where it splits off, heading west as a two-lane roadway. US 35 passes just north of a Chrysler manufacturing plant before an intersection with SR 931, the former route of US 31\\\\. The roadway briefly widens to a four-lane divided highway at a partial interchange with Davis Road, which connects from Kokomo. US 35 leaves the Kokomo area heading northwest into Cass County, toward Logansport. As US 35 nears Logansport, the roadway becomes a four-lane expressway, just prior to its intersection with US 24\\\\. The expressway bypasses Logansport to the south as part of the Hoosier Heartland Highway. There is a northbound (westbound) exit to Monticello Road, the former routing of these highways. Northbound US 35 and westbound US 24 exit the Hoosier Heartland Highway at a split diamond interchange and run concurrently along the interchange's westbound frontage road, having a very short overlap with SR 25 (southbound US 35 and eastbound US 24 run concurrently along the eastbound frontage road, also overlapping SR 25). US 35 and US 24 then turn northwest from the frontage road onto another expressway on the west edge of Logansport. Along the roadway, there is an intersection with the aforementioned Monticello Road and a two-quadrant interchange with Old State Road 25. After crossing the Wabash River, the overlapped routes have a final interchange where US 24 exits heading due west, while US 35 continues north-northwest. Northern terminus of U.S. Route 35, located east of I-94 near Michigan City Soon after US 24 leaves US 35, US 35 narrows back to a two-lane road and travels through the town of Winamac, in Pulaski County. Once in Starke County, the route travels through the town of Knox. In Davis Township, near Hamlet, the US 30 expressway provides an interchange. After entering LaPorte County, US 35 travels to the community of South Center in Union Township; there it turns west on US 6 (the US 35 roadway continues north as South County Road 300 E). The route next turns north-northwest until it leaves the concurrency with US 6 northward in Washington Township, near Kingsbury. Turning northwest, US 35 travels through the city of La Porte; in northwestern La Porte, an intersection with SR 39 provides access to the Indiana Toll Road/I-80/I-90. US 35 next crosses under the Indiana Toll Road with no direct interchange access, in unincorporated Center Township. Farther northwest, US 35 has its northern terminus where it meets US 20 in Springfield Township, just east of an interchange with I-94, near Michigan City. Logansport issues Logansport area residents, the sheriff's department and at least one transportation expert have voiced concerns about the split diamond interchange used on the Logansport section of the Hoosier Heartland Highway. From the interchange's opening in October 2013 through February 28, 2016, there had been 71 two-vehicle crashes at or near the interchange, 53 of those at the interchange's four intersections, two fatalities, and a number of injuries. Possible causes for the accidents include drivers' unfamiliarity with this type of interchange, which is typically built in cities, and is not common in semi-rural small towns; drivers' mistaking the frontage roads for entrance ramps and not stopping when required; the complexity of four major traffic routes converging on one interchange; ramp/frontage traffic controlled by stop signs alone, with cross- traffic not having to stop; stop signs not clearly visible at the crest of the exit ramps. In response, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) in 2014 added signage, placed flashing lights on the stop signs and installed rumble strips. These steps reduced, but did not eliminate the problems, with one of the fatalities taking place after these fixes. INDOT was planning by spring 2016 to add overhead flashers, move the stop signs to more visible positions, install channelizing islands and increase overhead intersection lighting. Note: Source probably meant diamond interchange. History =West Virginia= Originally, US 35 was routed from Charleston, West Virginia, on the north side of the Kanawha River (the current WV 62) to Point Pleasant until the collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967. When the new Silver Memorial Bridge was completed in 1969, US 35 was moved to the south side of the river (the former WV 17) away from Point Pleasant, and its southern terminus was in St. Albans, West Virginia, at the junction of US 60\\\\. Before funding was made available to convert US 35 to an expressway, a possibility had been put forward that the route would have been completed as a toll road. Prior to June 15, 2009, US 35 was relocated onto a new four-lane, mostly at- grade, expressway alignment running from I-64 in Teays Valley to a point about before Lower Buffalo Bridge, for a length of . As of June 15, 2009, the old segment of US 35 between US 60 and Lower Buffalo Bridge is now signed as WV 817\\\\. Prior to July 2011, the expressway segment of US 35 between Beech Hill, near the junction with WV 817 north, and near Henderson was completed, tying into some older expressway segments in the Henderson area and crossing the Silver Memorial Bridge. This had an approximate total length of . =Ohio= Before the adoption of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the route in Ohio was known in its entirety as SR 11. By 1966, the first freeway portion of the route began construction, comprising the Chillicothe bypass. Freeway portions on the east side of Dayton and south side of Xenia were completed by 1971, and around Washington Court House by 1974. Before 1988, westbound traffic on US 35 west of I-75 in Dayton turned north along Williams Street, then was routed along West Third Street (eastbound traffic on West Third Street turned south on Broadway Street back to US 35); on October 25, 1996, a new expressway alignment through west Dayton, known as the \\"US 35 West\\" project, was completed. The interchange at North Fairfield Road in Beavercreek opened on October 25, 2003. As part of the project, the existing ramp from State Route 835 (Research Boulevard) to westbound US 35 was removed, with the area converted to wetlands, and part of the pavement used as a connection to a regional rail trail. The section between Richmond Dale and Chillicothe was upgraded to a freeway in 2005. On August 26, 2015, the at-grade intersection with Keystone Furnace Road and McCarty Lane at the Jackson–Lick Township line was converted into a right-in/right-out interchange. =Indiana= The first signed road along the what would later become US 35 was SR 35, which ran from west of Jonesboro and Kokomo, and SR 15 from Burlington to Michigan City. In 1926 state road numbers were changed; SR 35 became SR 18 and SR 15 became SR 29. Many changes took place in 1930 along what would later become US 35, the first of which was a state road proposed between SR 38, near Richmond, and Muncie. This was followed by SR 21 being added to the state road system between Muncie and St. Anthony, and a state road being proposed between St. Anthony and SR 9 west of Jonesboro. The last change in 1930 was a proposed state road between Kokomo and Burlington. Between late 1930 and early 1932 SR 21 was added to the state road system between SR 38 and Muncie and between St. Anthony and Jonesboro. At the same time SR 18 became SR 22 and was extended east through Jonesboro and west to Burlington. Also during this time frame a state road was proposed between Kokomo and Logansport. In late 1932 or early 1933 SR 21 was paved between Richmond and Muncie and SR 22 was paved between Kokomo and Burlington. US 35 was first designated in the state of Indiana in 1935, US 35 was routed from the Ohio state line, near Richmond, to Michigan City, via Muncie, Kokomo, Burlington and Logansport, along SR 21, SR 22 and SR 29. At this time the Indiana State Highway Commission authorized the addition of SR 17 between Kokomo and Logansport. The construction on the authorized segment of SR 17 began between 1939 and 1941, with the construction being completed by 1942. US 35 was rerouted away from Kingsbury between 1942 and 1945, with the old route through the town becoming SR 829. The multi-lane road of US 35 from US 6 to La Porte opened either in 1951 or 1952. The US 35 designation was rerouted onto SR 3 and SR 28 between Munice and St. Anthony between 1956 and 1957. The old route of US 35 became locally maintained roads and streets. The bypass of Jonesboro was completed in either 1965 or 1966, and US 35 was routed along it from SR 15 to the west; east of SR 15 was signed as only SR 22. In 1967 or 1968 US 35 was rerouted onto SR 28, I-69, and SR 22 from St. Anthony to Jonesboro. The old route of US 35 became county roads or city streets. By 1970 US 35 was rerouted onto US 31 (now SR 931) to bypass downtown Kokomo. US 35 was rerouted onto SR 3 to bypass downtown Muncie between 1972 and 1973. By 1974 US 35 was rerouted away from downtown Logansport on the a bypass around the south and east sides of the city. The US 35 designation in Richmond was moved onto I-70 between 1997 and 1999. In October 2008 the Indiana Department of Transportation and the City of Michigan City came to an agreement for the city to assume maintenance of the segment of US 35 from the US 20/SR 212 interchange to US 12. The city did so in October 2009, and the former segment of US 35 became known as Michigan Boulevard. INDOT submitted an application in October 2008 to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to extend the decommissioning of US 35 to include the entire portion of the roadway from the east junction with US 20, through the US 20/SR 212 interchange, to US 12\\\\. INDOT still had signage, however, that indicated US 35 overlapped US 20 to the US 20/SR 212 interchange, which was not corrected until 2019. New bypass roads in Kokomo and Logansport opened in 2013 and US 35 was rerouted along both new roadways. Future =West Virginia= There is a remaining section of two- lane roadway from about before the Lower Buffalo Bridge to Beech Hill, near the junction with WV 817 north. This is the only gap in the plan to expand the entire length of US 35 in West Virginia to a four-lane, mostly at-grade, expressway. On September 19, 2017, then-West Virginia Transportation Secretary Tom Smith announced that the roadway upgrade would now include an interchange instead of an intersection at Shamrock Lane, serving the Lower Buffalo Bridge area. This section had a $174 million contract awarded on June 2, 2015 for its completion. The section was tentatively to have been completed by fall of 2019, but the West Virginia Department of Transportation extended the completion date to July 2021.

A time trialist is a road bicycle racer who can maintain high speeds for long periods of time, to maximize performance during individual or team time trials. The term cronoman, or chronoman, is also used to refer to a time trialist. Details In a traditional individual time trial, riders set off alone (not in a group or peloton) at intervals, typically anything from one to five minutes, and try to complete the course in as short a time as possible. In order to maximize the overall speed a time trialist must be able to maintain a steady effort throughout the event, of which the best measure is believed to be the rider's power at lactate threshold (LT) or aerobic threshold (AT). The best time trialists (such as Miguel Indurain, David Millar, Ellen van Dijk, Tony Martin, Tom Dumoulin and Fabian Cancellara), are believed to have very high power output at LT/AT, which they can then maintain for the duration of the time trials. Bradley Wiggins wearing the yellow jersey during a time trial at the 2012 Tour de France To be a successful time trialist, a cyclist must have exceptional aerodynamic posture and be able to take in plenty of oxygen. Aerodynamic performance can also be improved by riders using 'skin suits', overshoes and streamlined helmets. Bike technology is also important in time trials. By using aerodynamic components, a bicycle can be designed to minimize its drag coefficient, allowing a rider to drop his or her time by minutes during a long course. Time trials may also form individual stages of stage races. By incorporating time trial specialists into a cycling team, the team can lower its aggregate time dramatically. In relatively flat mass-start stages and races, time trialists often work as domestiques for their team leaders, or participate in breakaways. Some riders who are primarily time-trialists have also been able to compete in everything but the steepest climbs because of their good power-to-weight ratio. Tour de France winners Miguel Indurain, Jan Ullrich and Bradley Wiggins were primarily time-trialists but were also among the best in the mountain stages during the years in which they won the Tour de France. Likewise, Tom Dumoulin was able to win the 2017 Giro d'Italia by defending the lead he had built in the individual time trial in subsequent mountain stages.

It was used and re-used as a major ritual site over about 4000 years, and in its day would have been comparable to better known sites like the Standing Stones of Stenness. The summit lies 312 m above sea level, and is about 2 miles (3 km) north of Bathgate. In the 19th century the site was completely concealed by trees, then in 1947–1948 excavations by Stuart Piggott found a series of ritual monuments from successive prehistoric periods. In 1998, Gordon BarclayGordon Barclay, \\"Cairnpapple Revisited: 1948-1998\\", in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society Vol.65, 1999, pp.17-46. re-interpreted the site for Historic Scotland. It is designated a scheduled ancient monument. Neolithic Neolithic rituals began about 3500 BC with signs of small hearths, and precious objects left on the hill, presumably as offerings, including fine pottery bowls and stone axe heads imported from Cumbria and Wales. Probably around 3000 BC a Class II henge was constructed with the hilltop being surrounded by a bank outside a ditch about wide cut over into the rock, with wide entrances from north and south. Inside this an egg-shaped setting of 24 uprights (thought to have been timber posts, or possibly standing stones) enclosed an inner setting of similar uprights. Bronze Age Kite aerial photo of Cairnpapple Hill: henge and cairn Some time later a Bronze Age ritual added a small stone and clay cairn just off centre inside the monument, with a high standing stone to the east and a setting of smaller stones. Also aligned to this cairn were sockets for three upright stones at the centre of an arc of seven small pits, six of which contained cremated bones and two contained remains of bone skewer pins. Under the cairn traces were found of at least one burial, with wooden objects (perhaps a mask and club) and beaker people style pottery which indicates a date around 2000 BC. This cairn was later covered by a second much larger cairn about across and several yards (metres) high, with a kerb of massive stone slabs, which incorporated Bronze Age burial cists, one of which contained a food vessel pot. Subsequently, more stone was brought in to increase this cairn to about diameter, enclosing two cremation burials in inverted urns and now covering the original ditch and bank, making the whole site a tomb monument. Lastly, inside the ditch to the east four graves considered Iron Age are now thought to be early Christian because of their east-west alignment, and are dated to around 500 to 1000. Present day Interior of modern cairn The site is open to the public April to September and has a small visitor centre. The 1940s excavations have been partly covered by a concrete dome replicating the second cairn (although the dome is much higher than the cairn) so that visitors can go inside what was once a solid cairn and see the reconstructed graves, and outside this the surrounding post holes and graves are marked by being filled with colour-coded gravel like an archaeological plan, with the red gravel indicating upright pits, and the white gravel denoting the alleged Christian burials. The current display attempts to show all the main phases of the site at the same time. Cairnpapple Hill is the 445th highest Marilyn (sub 2000' peaks) in Scotland (Out of 571 total Marilyns) - the true top is to the south beside a trig point. Derivation of the name Although there is still some confusion about the origin of the name Cairnpapple Hill, or the alternative Cairniepapple, its meaning can be guessed to a certain extent. It is uncertain whether the name comes from a Brythonic language, related to Welsh; a Goidelic one, such as Scottish Gaelic; or a mixture of the two. The first part, cairn- means cairn, either from Brythonic (e.g. Welsh carn) or Goidelic (e.g. Gaelic càrn or càirn). The second part -ie-, means of the, as in Welsh y or Gaelic a'. The third part is the most problematic, possibly meaning any of tent (Welsh pabell, Gaelic puball), people/congregation (Welsh pob(o)l, Gaelic pobull), or even eye (compare Old Welsh pubell). Thus, Cairniepapple is most likely to mean Cairn of the tent, Cairn of the people, or Cairn of the eye.

He grew up in Beirut and moved to Munich, Germany, during the Lebanese Civil War in 1978. Musical style Abou-Khalil studied the oud at the Beirut conservatory with oudist Georges Farah. After moving to Germany, he studied classical flute at the Academy of Music in Munich under Walther Theurer. In his compositions and live concerts, he combines elements of Arabic music with jazz, rock, or classical music, and has earned praise as \\"a world musician years before the phrase became a label\\". — According to a review of his concert in The Guardian of 2002, Abou-Khalil \\"makes the hot, staccato Middle Eastern flavour and the seamless grooves of jazz mingle, as if they were always meant to.\\" In a review of his 2007 album Songs For Sad Women, the BBC wrote \\"the characteristic blend of jazz-inflected Arabic melody with subtle rhythms combines into a hypnotic whole, as ever with Abou-Khalil’s fluent oud playing in a central role.\\" Along with Tunisian oud virtuosos Anouar Brahem and Dhafer Youssef, he has helped establish the oud as an important instrument of Ethno jazz and world fusion. Among other musicians, Abou-Khalil has worked with ARTE Quartett (saxophone quartet), Alexander Bălănescu (violin), Luciano Biondini (accordion), Milton Cardona (conga), Sonny Fortune (alto saxophone), Michel Godard (tuba), Joachim Kühn (piano, alto saxophone), Howard Levy (harmonica), Charlie Mariano (alto saxophone), Gabriele Mirabassi (clarinet), Glen Moore (bass), Mark Nauseef (percussion), Setrak Sarkissian (darabukka), Ramesh Shotham (Indian percussion), Steve Swallow (bass), Glen Velez (frame drum, percussion), or Kenny Wheeler (flugelhorn). Albums His only album for the Munich based label ECM was called Nafas (1988). Since 1990, his albums have been published by Enja Records, Munich. For Al-Jadida (1992), Abou-Khalil invited alto saxophonist Sonny Fortune; Blue Camel (1992), featured alto saxophonist Charlie Mariano and flugelhorn player Kenny Wheeler. Morton's Foot (2004) presents Luciano Biondini on accordion and Sardinian singer Gavino Murgia. Journey to the Centre of an Egg (2005) features a trio of oud, piano (Joachim Kühn, who doubles on alto saxophone) and Jarrod Cagwin on drums. Nafas and Tarab make use of the ney, the Middle Eastern end-blown flute. Arabian Waltz features Abou-Khalil's compositions for string quartet (performed by the Balanescu Quartet), along with oud, Michel Godard on tuba (or serpent), and frame drums. In 2008, Abou-Khalil released an album entitled \\"Em Português\\" (\\"In Portuguese\\"), where he mixes fado with Arabic music with the participation of the fadista Ricardo Ribeiro. TV series: Visions of Music In 1998, Rabih Abou-Khalil hosted the television series Visions of Music. This 13-part documentary series produced by EuroArts Entertainment set out to explore the blending of jazz with different music styles of the world (Caribbean salsa, Brazilian samba, Argentine tango, French musette, Spanish flamenco, Jewish klezmer, New Orleans R&B; and Mississippi blues, as well as West African, South African, Indian, and Middle Eastern music) through historical footage and interviews with musicians by Abou-Khalil. The music of the TV-series was released on the album Visions of Music - World Jazz by Enja Records.

The highway's western terminus is at Deer Ridge Junction, an intersection in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, where it meets US 34\\\\. Its eastern terminus is at US 250 in Uhrichsville, Ohio.  Route description  =Colorado= US 34 approaching the western endpoint of US 36 at Deer Ridge Junction in Rocky Mountain National Park. US Route 36 begins at US 34 at Deer Ridge Junction in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, just west of Estes Park. It then passes through Boulder and Denver on its way to Kansas. Between Boulder and Denver, the road that is now US 36 was originally built as the Denver-Boulder Turnpike. It serves today as a major arterial freeway in the Front Range Urban Corridor. Between Denver and Byers, US 36 exists in unsigned overlaps with I-270 and I-70, while some parts of its original route are signed separately as Colorado State Highway 36. After it diverges from I-70 in Byers, US 36 is a relatively lightly-traveled two-lane rural highway to the Kansas state line. =Kansas= US-36 passes through all 13 counties in Kansas which border Nebraska. The highway enters the Sunflower State from Colorado in Cheyenne County, and leaves the state by crossing the Missouri River on the Pony Express Bridges entering Missouri. The section of US-36 from Washington, Kansas to St. Joseph, Missouri is officially called the Pony Express Highway because it marks the starting section of the Pony Express. It crosses the Missouri River on the Pony Express Bridges. From the western junction with K-383 to the Missouri state line, US-36 is part of the National Highway System. Except for wider sections in towns and passing lanes on hills, US-36 through Kansas is mostly a two-lane surface road. However some of the principal intersections all along the road are grade-separated diamond interchanges. From the Little Blue River just west of the K-148 junction to the US-77 North junction just west of the Big Blue River at Marysville, US-36 is a four-lane divided surface highway. From Hiawatha to west of Wathena, the road is a two-lane freeway. After passing through Wathena as a surface street (Riverside High School in Wathena fronts the westbound lanes), it becomes a four-lane freeway to the Missouri state line. =Missouri= US 36 across Missouri is a four-lane expressway with some freeway sections, passing through or near St. Joseph, Cameron, Chillicothe, Brookfield, Macon, Monroe City and Hannibal. Between I-35 in Cameron and the Illinois state line, it forms part of the principal route between Kansas City and Chicago. =Illinois= In the state of Illinois, U.S. 36 runs concurrently with much of Interstate 72. It enters from Missouri across the Mississippi River on the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge, and runs east, crossing Interstate 55 in Springfield. At the U.S. Route 51 bypass in Decatur, U.S. 36 leaves I-72 and runs due east through downtown Decatur. U.S. 36 then continues east, through Tuscola and several smaller communities, to the Indiana border. =Indiana= US 36 enters Indiana near Dana in Vermillion County. It then passes through the towns of Montezuma, Rockville, Bainbridge, Danville, and Avon before approaching Indianapolis. US 36 then joins I-465, traveling around the south side of the city (counter- clockwise in the eastbound direction). East of the city, US 36 exits onto Pendleton Pike and travels northeast. It passes through Lawrence, McCordsville, and Fortville before passing around the east side of Pendleton, where the route turns east. The route then travels mostly in a straight line, passing through Sulphur Springs, Losantville, Modoc, and Lynn before entering Ohio. The former routing through Indianapolis consisted of Rockville Road, Washington Street, West Street/Michigan Road (the latter once Northwestern Avenue, now Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street), 38th Street, and Pendleton Pike. =Ohio= US 36 enters Ohio in Darke County near the small village of Palestine, after which it passes through Darke, Miami, Champaign, Union, Delaware, Knox, and Coshocton counties before reaching its terminus at Uhrichsville in Tuscarawas County. It travels concurrent with US 127 in Greenville for about . Within the state, US 36 is classified as 83.1% rural and 16.9% urban with only coded as freeway (out of total). It also travels concurrent with US 33 in Marysville for about . The Birthplace of Rutherford B. Hayes, 19th President of the United States, 17 E. William St., Delaware, is on the north side of US 36, approximately west of the US 23 overpass. The home was demolished in 1926 and the location is marked with a historical monument.

On one occasion, while in the minors, Elberfeld threw a lump of mud into the umpire's open mouth.Legends of the Game at www.deadball.com Later in his career, Elberfeld assaulted umpire Silk O'Loughlin and had to be forcibly removed by police; Elberfeld was suspended for just 8 games.The Ballplayers – Kid Elberfeld  BaseballLibrary.com at www.baseballlibrary.com Records show he was tossed from a major league game 22 times as a player and 4 times as a managerhttp://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/E/Pelbek101.htm. Early career Elberfeld broke into organized baseball in 1892 in Clarkson, Tennessee.TheDeadballEra.com :: KID ELBERFELD'S OBIT at www.thedeadballera.com He was so highly regarded as a prospect that a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies recommended signing him over another shortstop prospect, Honus Wagner (a Hall of Famer). Elberfeld played only 14 games for the Phillies in 1898 before being sent to the Detroit Tigers, then a minor league team in the Western Conference. A year later, Elberfeld was purchased from Detroit by the Cincinnati Reds. Elberfeld lasted only 41 games in Cincinnati. Detroit Tigers: 1900–1903 Prior to the 1900 season, the Reds sent Elberfeld back to Detroit, then still part of the Western League. Elberfeld remained with Detroit when they joined the newly formed American League in 1901. He was the Tigers' starting shortstop during their first two seasons as a Major League team. In the team's debut, on April 25, 1901, the Tigers committed 7 errors, including 3 by Elberfeld. Later in the season, Elberfeld had 12 assists in a game on September 2, 1901. Elberfeld went on to bat .308 (with 76 RBIs and a .397 On Base Percentage) in the Tigers' inaugural season, becoming the Tigers' first team batting leader and its first .300 hitter. In 1902, Elberfeld's batting average dropped to .260, but he started the 1903 season on a hitting tear. In June 1903, with Elberfeld hitting .341 for the Tigers, he was traded to the New York Highlanders for Herman Long and Ernie Courtney. Despite his hot hitting, Elberfeld had fallen out of favor in Detroit after being suspended for abusing an umpire. Tiger manager Ed Barrow accused Elberfeld of deliberately throwing games to get himself traded. New York Highlanders: 1903–1909 Elbefeld was with the Highlanders from 1903 to 1909. During that time, he broke the .300 mark only once, batting .306 in 1906. Nevertheless, he was considered an integral part of the Highlanders teams, contributing in many small ways. For example, on May 20, 1907, Elberfeld stole home twice in the same game, the first American League player to accomplish that feat. In late June 1908, New York manager Clark Griffith resigned, and Elberfeld took over as the manager. The Highlanders finished the 1908 season, Elberfeld's only season as a Major League manager, in last place having gone 27–71 (a .276 winning percentage) under Elberfeld. Washington Senators and Brooklyn Robins: 1910–1914 Elberfeld with Brooklyn. In December 1909, Elberfeld was sold to the Washington Senators for $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He played two seasons for the Senators before being released. He signed with Montgomery in the Southern League, where he befriended a young Casey Stengel. According to Stengel biographer Maury Allen in his 1979 book, \\"'You Could Look It Up: The Life of Casey Stengel'\\", Elberfeld was generous with his time and his wisdom. The grizzled veteran and the 22-year-old youngster sat together on trains, roomed together in hotels, dined together in restaurants, shared thoughts on the bench and talked for hours about baseball. On September 15, 1912, Stengel was called up to Brooklyn. Elberfeld threw a farewell party for Stengel, ordering him to buy a new suit (\\"You gotta dress like a big leaguer before they believe you are one\\", Elberfeld said) for $22.00, and a new suitcase for $17.50. After a long night of drinking, Elberfeld walked with Stengel to the train station, and advised Stengel: \\"Keep your ears open and your mouth shut up there.\\" Stengel went on to be known as much for his mouth as for his baseball talent. Elberfeld returned briefly to the Major Leagues in 1914, where he played with the Brooklyn Robins. Player profile Aside from his temper, Elberfeld became known as one of the best shortstops in the early years of the twentieth century. He was known as a tough competitor who challenged baserunners to slash him out of their way. On May 1, 1908, Elberfeld was severely spiked in the foot by Bob Ganley‚ essentially ending his season. During Ty Cobb's rookie season, Cobb slid headfirst into second base, only to have Elberfeld dig his knee into the back of Cobb's neck, grinding his face in the dirt. According to a Cobb biographer, the incident marked the last time that Cobb would slide headfirst into a base.How Cobb Played the Game at wso.williams.edu Shortly before his death, Elberfeld was quoted as saying \\"Ty found out my feet were harder than his head. Then he started coming in spikes first. I had to protect myself.\\"BGS The Report Card – December 8, 2006 at www.beckett.com Elberfeld's legs were badly scarred from years of high-flying spikes, and it was reported that he poured raw whiskey into spike wounds to cauterize them.The Ballplayers – Kid Elberfeld at www.baseballlibrary.com Further showing his toughness, Elberfeld led the American League in times hit by a pitch in 1903 and 1911, and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, he was hit by a pitch 25 times, setting an American League record that was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor was hit 35 times. In his career, Elberfeld was hit 165 times, 13th on the all-time list. Despite 458 errors at the shortstop position, Elberfeld had great range in his early years. In 1901, he made 332 putouts and had a range factor rating of 6.14 – 87 points higher than the league average for shortstops. He also recorded a career-best 459 assists at shortstop the following season with the Tigers. Elberfeld collected 12 assists in a single game in 1901. As injuries and age slowed him down, Elberfeld's range was more limited later in his career. Minor league manager and retirement Elberfeld remained active in major and minor league baseball for 30 years. From 1915 to 1917, Elberfeld managed the Chattanooga Lookouts, then went on to the Little Rock Travelers, where he managed for several years, winning a pennant in 1920. While managing the Travelers, Elberfed met a 14-year-old Travis Jackson. Elberfeld observed Jackson in an impromtu workout, and later signed Jackson to his first professional contract. Early in his baseball career, Elberfeld bought an apple orchard on Signal Mountain, near Chattanooga. Elberfeld built his home and raised a family of five daughters and a son on Signal Mountain. His daughters formed a basketball team that played as \\"The Elberfeld Girls\\" and appeared on many Southern programs for several years. Elberfeld lived at his Signal Mountain home until his death in 1944.

Note George Hincapie working for his team leader Lance Armstrong, visible in the yellow jersey of the Tour de France. In road bicycle racing, a domestique is a rider who works for the benefit of his or her team and leader, rather than trying to win the race. In French, domestique translates as \\"servant\\".However, in French, the term used is équipier. In Italy and Spain, the term used is gregario (meaning \\"soldier of the Roman legions\\" or \\"one of the group\\", see etymology). In Belgium and the Netherlands the term knecht (meaning \\"servant\\" or \\"helper\\" in Dutch) is used. The use of the term dates back to 1911, although such riders had existed before then. First domestiques Much of a cyclist's effort is to push aside the air in front of him. Riding in the slipstream of another rider is easier than taking the lead. The difference increases with speed. Racers have known this from the start and have ridden accordingly, often sharing the lead between them. From there it is a small step to employing a rider to create a slipstream while his leader rides behind him. More complicated tactics become possible as the number of domestiques available increases (see below). Where the domestique finishes a race is less important than the help he gives. During their role as domestiques, riders do not share the fame of leaders such as Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault or Miguel Induráin. However, several domestiques have gone on to achieve fame of their own. Lucien Aimar, who supported Jacques Anquetil, won the 1966 Tour de France. Greg LeMond won the 1986 Tour de France after being Bernard Hinault's domestique in the 1985 Tour de France, as did Chris Froome in 2013 after riding for Bradley Wiggins in 2012. The writer Roger St Pierre said: The first riders known to have been employed to help a leader were Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban. They rode in the 1907 Tour de France for Henri Pépin, who promised them the equivalent of first prize if they would pace him from restaurant to restaurant.Novrup, Svend (1999), A Moustache, Poison and Blue Glasses, Bromley, UK The three never hurried. They took 12 hours and 20 minutes longer than Émile Georget on the stage from Roubaix to Metz - they were far from last - and the judges were powerless because the race was decided not on time but points. It mattered less what speed riders competed than the order in which they crossed the line. In an era when riders could be separated by hours, there was no point in hurrying after a rival who could not be caught and passed. The judges had to wait for everyone.ProCycling, UK, 2000 The rules of the Tour in its first decades forbade team riding but Pépin did little to affect the result. He dropped out on stage five. Terminology origin The word was first used in cycling as an insult for Maurice Brocco, known as Coco,Chany, Pierre, (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, La Martinière, France, p131 in 1911. Brocco started six Tours de France between 1908 and 1914, finished none of them, although a stage he won in 1911 caused the coining of domestique. Brocco's chances in 1911 ended when he lost time on the day to Chamonix. Unable to win, the next day he offered his services to other riders, for which he had a reputation. François Faber was in danger of being eliminated for taking too long and the two came to a deal. Brocco waited for Faber and paced him to the finish. Henri Desgrange, the organiser and chief judge, wanted to disqualify him for breaking the rules. But he had no proof and feared Brocco would appeal to the national cycling body, the Union Vélocipédique Française. He limited himself to scorn in his newspaper, L'Auto, writing: \\"He is unworthy. He is no more than a domestique.\\" Next morning Brocco greeted Desgrange with: \\"Today, monsieur, we are going to settle our accounts.\\" He won the day by 34 minutes. Desgrange followed him and the yellow jersey, Gustave Garrigou, as they climbed the Tourmalet. \\"So, am I forbidden to ride with him?\\" Brocco shouted. On the following mountain, the Aubisque, he dropped Garrigou, passed Paul Duboc, who had been poisoned and was in agony beside the road, and took the lead with Émile Georget. Desgrange was still watching. \\"Alors, quoi\\", Brocco shouted, \\"do I have the right to stay with him?\\" And then he rode off alone and won. He had made two points to Desgrange. The first was that he was a talented rider and not a servant. The second was that he had so much talent that his poor riding with Faber could only have been through a commercial arrangement. Desgrange replied that any rider with such flair had clearly been selling the race.Chany, Pierre, (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, La Martinière, France, p132 \\"He deserves his punishment\\", Desgrange wrote, \\"immediate disqualification.\\" Domestiques had long been accepted in other races. Desgrange believed the Tour should be a race of individuals and fought repeatedly with the sponsors, bicycle factories, who saw it otherwise. Desgrange got rid of the factories' influence only by reorganising the Tour for national teams in 1930, with the effect that he thereby acknowledged teamwork and therefore domestiques. Devoted domestiques The dominant climber of the 1950s, Charly Gaul, was followed for as long as he could last by Luxemburger Marcel Ernzer. The two men were of similar size and rode bikes of exactly the same dimensions, even though that made Ernzer a little low in the saddle. He was always there to give his bike to Gaul when it was needed. Andrea Carrea was a domestique for Fausto Coppi. \\"He was a gregario par excellence\\", said the journalist Jean-Luc Gatellier, \\"the incarnation of personal disinterest... showing to perfection the notion of personal sacrifice. He refused the slightest bit of personal glory.\\" Carrea was riding the Tour de France of 1952 and joined an attack to Lausanne to protect his leader's interests. > Carrea said: \\"Without knowing it, I had slid into the important break of the > day and at Lausanne, to my great surprise, I heard I had inherited a jersey > destined for champions. For me, it was a terrible situation.\\" Carrea had no idea he had become race leader. When officials told him, he burst into tears. He had ousted Coppi and he dreaded the consequences.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France He wept as he received his jersey, looking constantly down the road for the main field that included his leader. > Jean-Paul Ollivier said: Carrea thought the sky had fallen in. How would > Fausto take it? When the champion arrived a few minutes later, Carrea went > towards him in tears to offer his excuses. \\"You must understand that I did > not want this jersey, Fausto. I have no right to it. A poor man like me, the > yellow jersey?\\" Ollivier, Jean-Paul (1990), trans. and ed. Yates, R., The > True Story of Fausto Coppi, Bromley, London > Coppi said: \\"I wondered how Carrea, so shy and so emotional, was going to > take it. When I went to congratulate him on the track at Lausanne, he didn't > know what face he ought to adopt\\".L'Équipe, 13 July 2003 José Luis Arrieta was a domestique for Miguel Indurain. L'Équipe said: \\"He no longer counts the hours, the years, spent with his nose in the wind trying to protect his leader for as long as possible\\".L'Équipe, 7 July 2007 Arrieta said: Types of support =Basic support= A domestique retrieving water for his teammates. Domestiques bring water and food from team cars and shield teammates from opponents. They help teammates with mechanical disasters - should the leader puncture a tire, the domestique will cycle in front to create a slipstream allowing him to reclaim their position. A domestique may also sacrifice his bicycle or wheel. =Tactical support= Domestiques race in the interest of the team, or against opposing teams. By putting themselves in a breakaway they force other teams to chase. In turn, they chase a breakaway that threatens their team. Domestiques lead out sprinters by letting them 'draft' behind to conserve energy until the last few hundred meters. The lead-out train sometimes starts 10–15 km to the finish with up to eight domestiques setting a pace to discourage others from breaking away. One by one, worn-out teammates drop off. The last to lead a sprinter is often a good sprinter himself. The sprinter will launch into a dash to the line with one or two hundred meters to go. In mountainous races, domestiques help their leaders by setting a pace or thwarting attacks from others. Super-domestique Chris Froome assisting Bradley Wiggins (yellow jersey) in the 2012 Tour de France. Froome went on to win the 2013 Tour de France. There is a hierarchy among domestiques; the more accomplished, often called lieutenants or super- domestiques, are called upon during critical times. The lieutenant(s) stays with the leader as long as possible during demanding periods. For example, Lance Armstrong used teammates to set a pace during mountain stages of the Tour de France before a decisive attack. Experienced super-domestiques often also have the role of captain, passing on tactical instructions to other riders and making tactical decisions when there is little or no contact with the coaching staff. Examples of traditional super-domestiques are Andreas Klöden (Astana) and George Hincapie (Team BMC) in the 2009 Tour de France. Recent developments in the compositions of the rosters of leading teams have led to an increasing number of high-status riders fulfilling super-domestique duties, especially during the Grand Tours. This approach was largely originated by Team Sky, beginning with their success at the 2012 Tour de France, where Chris Froome finished second on the overall podium behind his teammate and compatriot Bradley Wiggins. This finish came after some tension between the two lead riders, in particular during Stage 17 of the race, where Froome was forced to wait for Wiggins - his defined team leader - three times on the climb to the summit finish at Peyragudes, allowing Alejandro Valverde to win the stage, while both Wiggins and Froome cemented their overall general classifications standings. Following this, a number of teams have adopted fluid, or shared team leadership at the Tour de France and the other Grand Tours. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions of the Tour de France all saw Sky - in 2019, changing sponsorship to become known as - successfully capture the yellow jersey, while a second rider from the team finished elsewhere within the top four: 2017 saw Froome win, with Mikel Landa coming fourth; in 2018, Geraint Thomas won his first Tour de France, while Froome finished third; and in 2019, Egan Bernal, who had himself served as a super-domestique to Froome and Thomas the previous year, subsequently finished first himself, with Thomas finishing second. This top-heavy strategy has also been a feature of other teams in contention, with mixed results. The for the 2018 and 2019 Tour's saw the deployment of the so-called 'Trident' of Mikel Landa, who had moved from Sky for the 2018 season, alongside long-term Movistar leaders and general classification contenders Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde. This tactic was largely unsuccessful for Movistar, who experienced difficulties in coordinating their three leaders, none of whom appeared willing to sacrifice their own ambitions to serve as super-domestiques for one of the other two. Comparatively, a more successful and more hierarchical example of the super- domestique system featured at the 2020 Tour de France through having entered the Tour with shared leadership between Tom Dumoulin and Primoz Roglic - both of whom were previous Grand Tour winners, alongside high finishes at the Tour de France itself - Dumoulin recognised that he would be unable to maintain his own general classification campaign, and voluntarily assumed a super- domestique role to Roglic. This allowed Jumbo-Visma to operate with similar tactics to those used by Sky/INEOS in previous years, by setting a higher pace throughout difficult climbs, buoyed by the fact that Dumoulin and other Jumbo- Visma support riders such as Sepp Kuss would remain present in breakaways and leaders' groups to protect Roglic, while the weaker support riders surrounding other contenders would be whittled away. But this had the unforeseen consequence of Jumbo-Visma being domestique’s for eventual winner and rival Tadej Pogačar of UAE Team Emirates. Nonetheless, the traditional domestique role remains an important one, and a 2020 poll of riders in the professional peloton by cyclingnews.com named Tim Declercq as the best domestique in the world, followed by Luke Rowe, Michael Mørkøv, Andrey Amador, Imanol Erviti, Michael Schär and Iljo Keisse. Individual glory Domestiques sometimes get a chance to win stages in stage racing. Typically this would be late in a stage race. Domestiques whose standings do not threaten the leaders will often not be chased if they break away. Domestiques can progress to more senior roles if they show ability. For example, at the 2012 Tour de France Tejay van Garderen of BMC Racing Team began the tour as a domestique for 2011 winner Cadel Evans but later became team leader due to Evans struggling and eventually won the young rider classification. Chris Froome of Team Sky also won a stage while riding in support of winner Bradley Wiggins, and became team leader the following year, where he eventually won the general classification. Assigned team roles vary substantially from race to race based on a variety of factors, including the course, the team members riding the race, their current physical condition, or even commercial factors. For instance, Stuart O'Grady, a veteran professional rider riding for Leopard-Trek, served as a domestique supporting Carlos Sastre in the 2008 Tour de France. By contrast, in the 2008 Herald Sun Tour, a much less-prominent race in which Sastre (and other high- profile members of the team) did not ride, the Australian O'Grady acted as team leader and was assisted by his teammates to win two stages and the general classification. Evolution of the domestique The UCI points system changed the relationship between domestiques and leaders. Previously, domestiques were not concerned with their finishing order. However, riders now get points for their finish position. This presses domestiques to also consider their own performance in addition to their leader's. Udo Bölts (right) riding as a Domestique for Jan Ullrich (the eventual winner) during the 1997 Tour de France. The 1990s saw the introduction of radio communication, allowing managers to assign tasks to domestiques wherever they are on the road. The influence of radios on race tactics is a topic of discussion amongst the cycling community, with some arguing that the introduction of radios in the 1990s has devalued the tactical knowledge of individual riders and has led to less exciting racing. In September 2009, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of pro cycling, voted to phase in a ban on the use of team radios in men's elite road racing.Andrew Hood, \\"Directors: UCI out of tune on race-radio ban\\", Velonews.com (September 27, 2009). Retrieved 3.06.2010 Finally radio found its undisputed place in peloton for good and, as some races with imposed radio ban proved, the ban changed nothing in racing tactics.  In track cycling  In track cycling's team pursuit event, a team of four riders must complete 4 km, with the third rider being used to stop the clock. Therefore, one rider often sprints towards the finish line to tow the teammates.

Domestique ","title":"Domestique"},{"id":"888823","title":"Frankie Dettori"},{"id":"888831","text":"Phocaea or Phokaia (Ancient Greek: Φώκαια, Phókaia; modern-day Foça in Turkey) was an ancient Ionian Greek city on the western coast of Anatolia. Greek colonists from Phocaea founded the colony of MassaliaPliny, 3.5. (modern-day Marseille, in France) in 600 BC, Emporion (modern-day Empúries, in Catalonia, Spain) in 575 BC and Elea (modern-day Velia, in Campania, Italy) in 540 BC. Geography Phocaea was the northernmost of the Ionian cities, on the boundary with Aeolis.Strabo, 13.1.2. It was located near the mouth of the river Hermus (now Gediz), and situated on the coast of the peninsula separating the Gulf of Cyme to the north, named for the largest of the Aeolian cities, and the Gulf of Smyrna (now İzmir) to the south. Phocaea had two natural harbours within close range of the settlement, both containing a number of small islands. Phocaea's harbours allowed it to develop a thriving seafaring economy, and to become a great naval power, which greatly influenced its culture. Recent archaeological surveys have shown that the city of Phocaea was large for the archaic period. Herodotus gives an idea of the size of Phocaea by describing the walls of Phocaea as having a length of several stadia.Herodotus, 1.163 . A 4th century BC Persian tomb, known as Tas Kule (rock tower), stands (38º 39' 37\\" N, 26º 49' 2\\" E) 7 km east of Phocaea along a main road. This funerary monument was carved out of solid rock with a lower 2.7 meter high rectangular story (9 × 6 meters) surmounted by a second 1.9 meter high story (3 × 3 meters). Four steps between the two levels suggest strong Persian influence and most archaeologists believe this tomb was built for a Persian aristocrat or local leader serving the Persians. Compare the style of the tomb of Cyrus. History Stater coin from Phocaea with Griffin head; Circa 580 BC. The ancient Greek geographer Pausanias says that Phocaea was founded by Phocians under Athenian leadership, on land given to them by the Aeolian Cymaeans, and that they were admitted into the Ionian League after accepting as kings the line of Codrus.Pausanias, 7.3.10. See also, Herodotus, 1.146.1 which mentions \\"Phocian renegades\\" as being among the settlers of Ionia. Pottery remains indicate Aeolian presence as late as the 9th century BC, and Ionian presence as early as the end of the 9th century BC. From this an approximate date of settlement for Phocaea can be inferred.Stillwell, \\"Phokaia\\". According to Herodotus the Phocaeans were the first Greeks to make long sea-voyages, having discovered the coasts of the Adriatic, Tyrrhenia and Spain. Herodotus relates that they so impressed Arganthonios, king of Tartessus in Spain, that he invited them to settle there, and, when they declined, gave them a great sum of money to build a wall around their city.Herodotus, 1.163. Their sea travel was extensive. To the south they probably conducted trade with the Greek colony of Naucratis in Egypt, which was the colony of their fellow Ionian city Miletus. To the north, they probably helped settle Amisos (Samsun) on the Black Sea, and Lampsacus at the north end of the Hellespont (now the Dardanelles). However Phocaea's major colonies were to the west. These included Alalia in Corsica, Emporiae and Rhoda in Spain, and especially Massalia (Marseille) in France. Phocaea remained independent until the reign of the Lydian king Croesus (circa 560–545 BC), when they, along with the rest of mainland Ionia, first, fell under Lydian controlHerodotus, 1.6. and then, along with Lydia (who had allied itself with Sparta) were conquered by Cyrus the Great of Persia in 546 BC, in one of the opening skirmishes of the great Greco-Persian conflict. Rather than submit to Persian rule, the Phocaeans abandoned their city. Some may have fled to Chios, others to their colonies on Corsica and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, with some eventually returning to Phocaea. Many however became the founders of Elea, around 540 BC.For Herodotus' account of the flight of the Phocaeans, see: 1.164-168\\\\. See also Strabo, 6.1.1. In 500 BC, Phocaea joined the Ionian Revolt against Persia. Indicative of its naval prowess, Dionysius, a Phocaean was chosen to command the Ionian fleet at the decisive Battle of Lade, in 494 BC.Herodotus, 6.11-12. However, indicative of its declining fortunes, Phocaea was only able to contribute three ships, out of a total of \\"three hundred and fifty three\\".Herodotus, 6.8. The Ionian fleet was defeated and the revolt ended shortly thereafter. Coinage of Phokaia, Ionia, circa 478-387 BC. Possible portrait of Satrap Tissaphernes, with satrapal headress. After the defeat of Xerxes I by the Greeks in 480 BC and the subsequent rise of Athenian power, Phocaea joined the Delian League, paying tribute to Athens of two talents. In 412 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, with the help of Sparta, Phocaea rebelled along with the rest of Ionia. The Peace of Antalcidas, which ended the Corinthian War, returned nominal control to Persia in 387 BC. In 343 BC, the Phocaeans unsuccessfully laid siege to Kydonia on the island of Crete.C. Michael Hogan, Cydonia, Modern Antiquarian, January 23, 2008 During the Hellenistic period it fell under Seleucid, then Attalid rule. In the Roman period, the town was a manufacturing center for ceramic vessels, including the late Roman Phocaean red slip. It was later under the control of Benedetto Zaccaria, the Genoan ambassador to Byzantium, who received the town as a hereditary lordship; Zaccaria and his descendants amassed a considerable fortune from his properties there, especially the rich alum mines. It remained a Genoese colony until it was taken by the Turks in 1455.. It is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1914, Phocaea was the location of a massacre against ethnic Greek civilians by Turkish irregular bands. Coinage Electrum coinage of Phocaea, 340-335 BC. Probably following the Lydians, the Phocaeans were among the earliest in the world to make and use coins as money. Its earliest coins were made of electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold. The British Museum has a Phocaean coin containing the image of a seal dating from 600 to 550 BC.In Greek, \\"phoce\\" (Φώκη) means \\"seal\\", British Museum: \\"Electrum stater with a seal\\".

Dobbs started working with CNN at its inception in 1980, serving as a reporter and network vice president. On the air, he served as host and managing editor of the network's business program, Moneyline, which premiered in 1980. The show was renamed Lou Dobbs Tonight in 2003. Dobbs resigned from CNN for a short period of time in 1999 but rejoined the network in 2001. He resigned once again in November 2009. In 2011, he joined the Fox Business Network, resuming and anchoring his show, Lou Dobbs Tonight. He is the former talk radio host of Lou Dobbs Radio. Dobbs has authored several books since 2001. Dobbs was an early promoter of birther conspiracy theories, which falsely posit that former U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born US citizen. He is known for anti- immigration views, as well as for various deep state conspiracy theories and opposition to NAFTA and other trade deals. A Trump confidant, his show is known for its pro-Trump coverage. Early life Born in Childress County, Texas in 1945, Dobbs is the son of Frank Dobbs, a co-owner of a propane business, and Lydia Mae (née Hensley), a bookkeeper. When Dobbs was age twelve, his father's propane business failed and the family moved to Rupert, Idaho. Although accepted at the University of Idaho and Idaho State University, he was persuaded by the staff at Minico High School to apply to Harvard University, where he was accepted and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. While at Harvard, Dobbs lived in Quincy House and was elected to the Owl Club. After college, Dobbs worked for federal anti-poverty programs in Boston and Washington, D.C., then returned to Idaho. He briefly attended the University of Idaho College of Law in Moscow, and then worked as a cash-management specialist for Union Bank of California in Los Angeles. He married his high school sweetheart in 1969, and in 1970 their first son was born. Dobbs moved to Yuma, Arizona, and got a job as a police and fire reporter for KBLU. By the mid-1970s he was a television anchor and reporter in Phoenix, and he later joined Seattle's KING-TV. In 1979, he was contacted by a recruiter for Ted Turner, who was in the process of forming CNN. Dobbs divorced his first wife in 1981 and later married Debi Lee Segura, a former CNN sports anchor. The couple raised four children together. Dobbs resides on a horse farm in Wantage Township, New Jersey. Career = CNN = Dobbs joined CNN when it launched in 1980, serving as its chief economics correspondent and as host of the business news program Moneyline on CNN. Dobbs also served as a corporate executive for CNN, as its executive vice president and as a member of CNN's executive committee. He founded CNN fn (CNN financial news), serving as its president and anchoring the program Business Unusual, which examined business creativity and leadership. =Departure and founding of Space.com= Dobbs repeatedly clashed with Rick Kaplan, who became president of CNN in 1997. Dobbs said Kaplan, noted friend of then president Bill Clinton, was \\"clearly partisan\\" and \\"was pushing Clinton stories\\", while Kaplan said Dobbs was \\"a very difficult person to work with\\". On April 20, 1999, CNN was covering Clinton's speech in Littleton, Colorado, following the Columbine High School massacre. Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast Moneyline. Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, \\"Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it\\". Dobbs announced on the air that \\"CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton\\". A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start Space.com, a website devoted to astronautical news. Dobbs was subsequently replaced as host of Moneyline by Willow Bay and Stuart Varney. =Return to CNN= Kaplan left CNN in August 2000, and Dobbs returned the following year, at the behest of his friend and CNN founder Ted Turner, becoming host and managing editor of the new and initially more general news program Lou Dobbs Reporting, which later became CNN News Sunday Morning. He also regained the helm of the newly renamed Lou Dobbs Moneyline (which became Lou Dobbs Tonight in June 2003). According to the Washington Post, Dobbs started to increasingly focus on the alleged dangers of illegal immigration after returning to CNN. Dobbs became a self-described populist after his return to CNN, and criticized the \\"greed\\" of big corporations and their opposition to raising the minimum wage. =Exit from CNN= In July 2009, controversy around Dobbs began when he was the only mainstream news anchor to give airtime to the birther conspiracy theory. Several liberal advocacy groups, including Media Matters, and the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized Dobbs for his reporting. The controversy eventually caused CNN President Jon Klein to rein Dobbs in via an internal memorandum. In September, advocates challenged Dobbs for appearing at a conference organized by the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform. Multiple campaigns were launched, including \\"Drop Dobbs\\" (NDN, Media Matters). The campaigns also attacked CNN for alleged hypocrisy towards Latinos, citing CNN's Latino in America special as incompatible with their continued support of Dobbs. The campaigns generated considerable anti- Dobbs press. On the November 11, 2009 edition of his nightly broadcast Lou Dobbs Tonight, Dobbs announced his immediate departure from CNN, ending a nearly thirty-year career at the network, citing plans to \\"pursue new opportunities\\". CNN President Jon Klein said that Dobbs' departure was not a result of organized opposition to Dobbs' viewpoints. Dobbs was reportedly paid $8 million in severance pay when he left CNN. After Dobbs left CNN in 2009, he gave an interview where he did not rule out the possibility of running for President of the United States in 2012, saying the final decision would rest with his wife.Memmot, Mark (2009-11-24) \\"Lou Dobbs Hints At White House Run In 2012 As An Independent\\", NPR.org.

Former Senator Dean Barkley said he thought Dobbs should run for president. =Radio= From 2009 to 2012, Dobbs hosted Lou Dobbs Radio on United Stations Radio Networks. The three-hour daily show had affiliates in several major markets, including its flagship station (WOR) in New York City, Washington D.C. (WHFS), Miami (WZAB-AM) and the San Francisco Bay Area (KDOW), as well as stations such as WGNY-AM in Newburgh, New York. The show was guest- centered and featured political discussion and listener calls. It aired from 2 to 5 pm Eastern, directly competing with The Sean Hannity Show, The Tom Sullivan Show and The Dave Ramsey Show. Dobbs also hosts the financially themed Lou Dobbs Minute on the same network. In June 2008, Dobbs reached an agreement with Business Talk Radio Network to carry a rebroadcast of the show from 7 to 10 pm Eastern, displacing Bruce Williams. Dobbs' show was also carried live on CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks. Dobbs was among the hosts who tried out for the position vacated by the cancellation of Imus in the Morning on WFAN, a position that was eventually filled by Boomer and Carton in the Morning. Dobbs mentioned on his radio show that he is currently seeking a position in the US Department of Treasury during the economic crisis. He stated that he believed he could \\"do more good than the clowns currently in position.\\" Dobbs also is a regular columnist in Money magazine, U.S. News & World Report, and the New York Daily News. =Fox Business Network= On November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network announced that Dobbs would host a show on the channel.Lou Dobbs joining Fox Business Network Los Angeles Times November 10, 2010 The network announced on March 3, 2011 the start date, show title, and time slot of Dobbs' new show. Entitled Lou Dobbs Tonight, the program debuted on March 14, 2011, airing at 7 pm Eastern. =Other appearances= Since 2009, Dobbs has made regular appearances to discuss issues on other news network programs including CNBC's The Kudlow Report and Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor. On October 5, 2010, Dobbs made a guest appearance on an episode of The Good Wife, entitled \\"Double Jeopardy\\", October 5, 2010 in which he plays himself as a client in search of a new law firm to represent his legal interests. Political views and controversies Dobbs is known for his anti-immigration views, warnings about Islamist terror, and his opposition to free trade. He is known for his pro-Trump coverage. =China= In December 2018, Dobbs suggested that the United States should start a war with China because of hacking by Chinese state actors. He compared hacking by the People's Liberation Army of China to the attack by the Japanese military on Pearl Harbor in 1941. =Birtherism= Dobbs promoted the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States.Guardian Unlimited, 29 July 2009, Birthers are citizens of Idiot America His willingness to raise the \\"birther\\" issue repeatedly,\\"a lot of questions remaining, and seemingly the questions won't go away because they haven't been dealt with\\". Lou Dobbs Tonight, CNN, 20 July 2009, transcript even though CNN itself considered it a \\"discredited rumor\\",Los Angeles Times, 22 July 2009, Lou Dobbs and the canard over President Obama's birth led the Washington Post's TV critic to remark that this \\"explains their upcoming documentary: 'The World: Flat. We Report – You Decide.'\\"Washington Post, 29 July 2009, An Old Rumor Bears Repeating On CNN The issue had come up in 2008 during the Presidential campaign, and had largely disappeared from the media spotlight until Dobbs picked up the issue again.Daily Telegraph, 25 July 2009, Right Wing US conspiracists question Obama's birth certificate His statements in support of these conspiracy theories were dubbed \\"racist\\" and \\"defamatory\\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Los Angeles Times, 25 July 2009, CNN chief addresses Obama birth controversy The controversy led to Media Matters airing ads critical of Dobbs and of CNN,Baltimore Sun TV blog, August 2009, Lou Dobbs becomes a real problem for CNN and to Jon Stewart mocking Dobbs on the satirical Comedy Central television series The Daily Show.Gawker, 23 July 2009, Jon Stewart to Lou Dobbs: 'Do You Even Watch Your Own F-ing Network?!' The Associated Press said that Dobbs had \\"become a publicity nightmare for CNN, embarrassed his boss and hosted a show that seemed to contradict the network's 'no bias' brand.\\"Associated Press. 3 August 2009, Lou Dobbs Challenges His Own CNN Network =Environment= Dobbs rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. Dobbs has incorrectly asserted that scientists used to warn about global cooling in the 1970s.The Myth Of The 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus: https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/131047.pdf He said of the Obama administration's EPA that it was being run as if it were \\"part of the apparat of the Soviet Union.\\" =Immigration= Dobbs holds anti-immigration views. Dobbs has been strongly opposed to both illegal immigration and foreign worker programs as the H-1B visa program and guest-worker programs. In a 2006 article, Dobbs expressed frustration at failed legislation to build a southern \\"border fence to stop the flow of illegal aliens and drugs across our borders.\\" He argued that the \\"true victims of corporate America's lust for cheap labor\\" were \\"American working men and women, taxpayers all.\\" During efforts to implement comprehensive immigration reform during the Bush administration in 2007, Dobbs devoted more than a quarter of all of his airtime during a three-month period to the subject of immigration, and covered it negatively. Dobbs' show has made factually incorrect claims, such as the one that illegal immigrants were responsible for bringing 7,000 new cases of leprosy to the United States in a three-year period, where the actual timeframe was over the last thirty years.James L. Krahenbuhl, the director of the National Hansen's Disease Program, cited in In addressing the leprosy issue, Dobbs in May 2007 compared his critics from the left and right political spectrums to \\"commies\\" and \\"fascists.\\" Dobbs has also falsely claimed that \\"illegal aliens\\" were a third of the total prison population in the United States. Dobbs has criticized local officials for their approach to border security. In October 2007 he labeled then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer an \\"idiot\\" for advocating the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Hillary Clinton labeled Dobbs' illegal immigration segments as having \\"all that hot air.\\" In March 2009, Dobbs said he thought that there should not be a St. Patrick's Day. In a November 2009 interview with Telemundo, Dobbs said that the U.S. needed a \\"rational, effective humane policy\\" for immigration that included enhanced border security and also \\"the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions.\\"Angie Drobnic Holan, Did Lou Dobbs oppose amnesty? He doesn't oppose it now, Politifact (November 30, 2009).Peter Wallsten, Dobbs Reaches Out to Latinos, With Politics in Mind, Wall Street Journalist (November 25, 2009). In October 2010, The Nation published the results of a yearlong investigation detailing undocumented workers who had worked on Dobbs' personal properties. The labor involved upkeep of Dobbs' multimillion-dollar estates in New Jersey and Florida, including the horses belonging to his daughter, Hillary, a champion show jumper. The article featured interviews with five immigrants who had worked without papers on Dobbs' properties. Speaking to the Associated Press, Dobbs referred to the article as \\"a political assault,\\" claiming it was a lie that he hired illegal immigrants. He said: \\"I have never, do not now, and never will.\\"Report: Illegal Labor Worked at Dobbs' homes AP via Washington Post; October 7, 2010. In November 2018, Dobbs falsely claimed that \\"many\\" undocumented immigrants voted in the 2018 mid-term elections and that they had an \\"immense impact.\\" Dobbs' critics, including columnist James K. Glassman, author of Dow 36,000 and member of the American Enterprise Institute think tank, have accused him of inciting xenophobia. Others have accused him of Hispanophobia, a charge he denies and one which he has said offends him deeply, as his wife Debi Segura is a Mexican-American. After President Donald Trump stated in March 2019 that he supported legal immigration \\"in the largest numbers ever,\\" Dobbs lamented that Trump was advancing \\"the interests of the global elite ahead of our citizens,\\" adding, \\"the White House has simply lost its way.\\" = Support for Trump = Dobbs's coverage of Trump during his presidency has been extremely supportive, with some describing it as fawning and sycophantic. Dobbs opened a 2017 interview with Trump with \\"You have accomplished so much\\", and later said to Trump that he was \\"one of the most loved and respected\\" presidents \\"in history\\". The New York Times described the interview as a love-fest and \\"courtier-like session\\", as Dobbs \\"didn't so much ask questions as open his mouth and let rose petals fall out\\". During Trump's presidency, Dobbs has been described as a \\"close informal adviser to President Donald Trump\\". Trump repeatedly calls Dobbs to get his views on various policy issues. Dobbs is a proponent of the Deep State conspiracy theory. In January 2018, Dobbs called for a \\"war\\" on the \\"Deep State\\", which he described as the FBI and the Department of Justice. Dobbs said that the FBI and DOJ had destroyed evidence and that they were clandestinely working to bring down the Trump presidency. In June 2018, Dobbs promoted a conspiracy which originated on Reddit and the far-right conspiracy website Gateway Pundit that \\"the FBI May have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015\\". Shortly after Dobbs promoted the unfounded conspiracy theory, Trump retweeted Dobbs' assertion and praised Dobbs for a \\"great interview\\". In July 2018, Dobbs said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was on a \\"jihad\\" against Trump, and accused him of seeking to \\"subvert\\" and \\"overthrow\\" Trump's presidency. In December 2018, Dobbs said there was \\"a legion of evildoers\\" in the FBI and that \\"we've got all of the folks in the FBI, corrupt, politically corrupt.\\" That same month, he said that the judge overseeing Michael Flynn's sentencing sounded as if he was part of Mueller's \\"witch hunt.\\" In July 2018, Dobbs defended the Trump administration's decision to ban a CNN reporter from a press event. Multiple Fox colleagues, including Fox News President Jay Wallace, had shown solidarity with CNN and called on the White House to rescind the ban. His defense led to charges of hypocrisy: in 2012, when a Daily Caller reporter was criticized by the White House for shouting out a question during an address by Obama, Dobbs defended the reporter, saying \\"What is rude is a president not speaking to the American people and taking the questions of the White House press'. CNN's Jake Tapper suggested that Dobbs was hypocritical. In August 2018, Dobbs ran a segment pushing unsubstantiated claims that Google was biased against Trump and that Google was promoting anti-Trump stories. Following Dobbs' segment, Trump tweeted that Google was suppressing conservatives and he tasked economic adviser Larry Kudlow to look into regulating Google. In September 2018, after Trump falsely claimed that the official death count from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico was fabricated by Democrats, Dobbs defended Trump's assertion. Dobbs claimed that \\"the numbers were inflated\\" and that the organizations behind the numbers \\"threw out science, statistics, and evidence to discredit the Trump administration\\". In October 2018, when CNN and a number of prominent Democrats were targeted with bomb attempts, Dobbs described the bomb attempts as \\"fake news\\" and promoted conspiracy theories that the bomb attempts were by Democrats who sought to increase their support in the upcoming mid-term elections. Several Fox News employees expressed dismay over Dobbs' rhetoric, with one employee telling CNN, \\"It's people like Dobbs who really ruin it for all the hard working journalists at Fox\\". When the Trump administration rescinded CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass, Dobbs supported the administration. At the same time, numerous media organizations, including Fox News, spoke out against the Trump administration's decision. When U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, temporarily restored Acosta's press pass, Dobbs described the ruling as \\"absurd.\\" When the Trump administration complied with the ruling, Dobbs called on the administration to ignore the ruling and tell the \\"district court judge to go to hell.\\" In January 2019, Dobbs described Mitt Romney as a \\"traitor\\" and \\"treasonous\\" after he published an op-ed in the Washington Post criticizing Trump's character. In July 2019, Dobbs referred to U.S. military generals who raised concerns about Trump's decision to put on a 4 July military show in Washington D.C. as \\"Snowflake Generals\\". During the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, The New York Times reported that former Trump national security advisor and 11-year paid contributor to Fox News John Bolton had written in his forthcoming book that Trump had told him that he wanted to continue withholding aid to Ukraine until the country investigated Democrats and the Bidens. On his show the following day, Dobbs asserted that Bolton had been \\"reduced to a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state with his allegation.\\" The day senior Justice Department officials intervened in the case of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone with a recommendation of a lighter sentence than had been recommended by DOJ prosecutors the prior day, Dobbs stated on his program that attorney general Bill Barr was \\"doing the Lord's work\\" by intervening. The intervention raised questions about the political neutrality of the DOJ. The next day, Barr stated in a televised interview that Trump's comments about ongoing DOJ investigations \\"make it impossible to do my job,\\" causing Dobbs to state on his program, \\"I guess I am so disappointed in Bill Barr, I have to say this – it’s a damn shame when he doesn’t get what this president has gone through, and what the American people have gone through, and what his charge is as attorney general.\\" The following day, after the Justice Department stated it would not prosecute former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of Trump's ire, Dobbs stated on his program, \\"I have serious, serious questions tonight about the integrity of the Justice Department under Attorney General Barr.\\" =George Soros conspiracy theories= Dobbs has peddled numerous conspiracy theories about the Jewish-American philanthropist and businessman George Soros. Dobbs has referred to him as an \\"evil SOB\\" and insidious. Dobbs's Fox Business Channel shows stirred controversy in October 2018 when a guest on Dobbs' show used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was \\"Soros-occupied\\" territory (which echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a \\"Zionist-occupied government\\"). The remarks came days after bombing attempts on Soros, and the remarks were replayed on Fox Business hours after an anti-Semitic attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue which killed 11 people. After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that the guest, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch, would no longer be booked and that the program episode would be withdrawn from the Fox News archives. In the midst of the Trump-Ukraine scandal in November 2019, attorney Joseph diGenova made similar comments on Dobbs's program, falsely claiming that \\"George Soros controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department. He also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs – work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine.\\" Dobbs did push back on DiGenova's claim. On September 11, 2019, Dobbs warned his viewers on Fox Business that Soros' \\"tentacles were spreading globally\\", deploying a well- known antisemetic canard in which the Jewish people are depicted as an octopus spreading its tentacles all over the world.Fox Business Host Lou Dobbs Uses Anti-Semitic Trope On George Soros. The Forward, 12 September 2019 =Other views= Dobbs is pro-choice, opposes gun control and, though he is a fiscal conservative, supports some government regulations, as revealed in a 60 Minutes interview. He has been critical of trade policies that he says encourage \\"sending jobs overseas\\". Dobbs' stance on trade has earned plaudits from some trade union activists on the traditional political left, while his stance on immigration tends to appeal to the right. In an interview with Larry King, Dobbs revealed that he is now \\"an unaffiliated independent\\" owing to dissatisfaction with both the Republican and Democratic parties. Dobbs is the author of War on the Middle Class, in which he claims that both Democrats and Republicans are harming the middle class. In it, he comes out strongly against the Bush tax cuts, which he argues favor the wealthy, and argued for raising the U.S. minimum wage from what was then $5.15 an hour.  Reception  Journalist Amy Goodman has criticized Dobbs' journalistic ethics, accusing him of making flagrant errors in his reporting and assailing his staff's association with what she describes as disreputable sources. Awards Dobbs has won numerous major awards for his television journalism, including a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award and a Cable Ace Award. He received the George Foster Peabody Award for his coverage of the 1987 stock market crash. He also has received the Luminary Award of the Business Journalism Review in 1990, the Horatio Alger Association Award for Distinguished Americans in 1999 and the National Space Club Media Award in 2000. The Wall Street Journal has named Dobbs \\"TV's Premier Business News Anchorman\\". In 2004, Dobbs was awarded the Eugene Katz Award For Excellence in the Coverage of Immigration by the Center for Immigration Studies and in 2005 he received the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution's Statesmanship Award. Dobbs was named \\"Father of the Year\\" by the National Father's Day Committee in 1993. In 2008 Dobbs received the American Legion Public Relations Award from the National Commander of The American Legion. Books * Lou Dobbs, with James O.

The route has several names including Pearl Road from Cleveland to Medina in Northeast Ohio, Reading Road in Cincinnati, Cincinnati and Lebanon Pike in southwestern Ohio and Brownsboro Road in Louisville. Traveling northeast, the highway ends in downtown Cleveland and traveling southwest ends in Louisville. Interstate 71 (I-71) fully supplanted US 42 as an interurban highway in the early 1960s, relegating US 42 to its current role as an ordinary town-to-town surface road. Additionally, I-71 passes through Columbus, where US 42 avoids Columbus completely. It remains intact as a route; no part of it has ever been diverted to any Interstate highway.

Route description =Kentucky= U.S. Route 42 starts in Louisville, Kentucky, heading northeast through Prospect on the Oldham County and Jefferson County line. From here US 42 is a two lane road passing through the northern Kentucky hills paralleling between Interstate 71 and the Ohio River. Next, it passes through Goshen and North Oldham High School, which sits off to its north side. US 42 continues through Oldham County into Trimble County. In Bedford US 42 intersects with US 421 and is concurrent through downtown. The route still heading northeast crosses into Carroll County prior to crossing the Kentucky River and entering Carrollton. US 42 follows northeast along the south bank of the Ohio River passing Markland Lock and Dam and KY 1039 Markland Dam Bridge which connects between Kentucky Speedway and Indiana. Heading east US 42 parallels the Ohio River passing through Warsaw, Gallatin County about prior to intersecting with US 127 starting an extended concurrency. US 127 heads south toward Glencoe, Owenton, and eventually Frankfort. From the intersection with US 127, US 42 turns away from the Ohio River bank. US 42 enters Boone County about prior to intersecting with the western terminus of Kentucky Route 14 (KY 14). Continuing north US 42-127 in about intersects Beaver Road KY 338 creating a wrong-way concurrency between US 127 and KY 338: when going north, drivers are traveling east on US 42, north on US 127, and south on Kentucky 338\\\\. This continues for less than a mile until it intersects with Richwood Pike where KY 338 splits off continuing south. Continuing north for several miles the US 42-127 intersects with KY 536 (Mount Zion Road). Prior to KY 536 Ryle High School sits on the road's west side.

Within Florence US 25 Dixie Highway joins in a concurrency with US 42-127 which takes on the name Dixie Highway. After crossing briefly into Elsmere, the route enters Erlanger. US 42 becomes almost entirely a commercial road for the duration of its length in Erlanger. Prior to leaving Erlanger, US 42 becomes narrower and more congested after it crosses KY 236\\\\. US 42 is primarily a commercial road prior to crossing under I-275 and proceeds to turn back into an almost purely residential road with a few exceptions while going north. The route intersects with KY 1303 (Turkeyfoot Road) northern terminus. The Crestview Hills town center lies just south of I-275 on the east side of the road, between Dixie Highway and Turkeyfoot Road. Dixie Heights High School is less than a mile down the road on the western side. Two intersections later US 42 is joined with KY 371 for about . After crossing I-71/I-75 again the road heads in a northeast direction closely parallel to I-71/I-75. As it heads north US 42 starts off mostly as a residential road, turning more and more into a commercial road. As it winds down from the suburbs into Covington the highway's name changes from Dixie Highway to Pike Street prior to crossing I-71/I-75 again.

The portion of US 42 in Warren County between Lebanon and Waynesville is designated \\"Sergeant Brian Dulle Memorial Highway\\", in honor of a Warren County Sheriff's deputy who was struck and killed along US 42 on May 10, 2011 by a stolen car, while he was laying out stop sticks to catch the driver. The intersection with Spring Valley–Paintersville Road in Spring Valley Township, Greene County near the village of Spring Valley has been the site of numerous fail-to-yield accidents, including a double fatality in 2017. In October 2018, the Ohio Department of Transportation announced that it would convert the intersection into a \\"basic RCUT\\", which would add a median and replace all left turns with right-in/right-out turns and median U-turns. The project is expected to cost around $1.2 million and begin in late 2020. In Xenia, the intersection of US 42 (North Columbus Street) and East Church Street, where US 42 formerly continued at an awkward angle, was converted to a roundabout on June 12, 2020, at a cost of approximately $1.1 million. After leaving Xenia, major cities along the route are London, Delaware, Mansfield, Ashland and Medina prior to reaching the Cleveland metropolitan area. In London US 42 intersects with I-70. Other than a short concurrency at each end, in Delaware are the only other two concurrencies with US routes. Entering Delaware from the south US 42 runs concurrent with US 23 in Delaware until the junction with US 36 which it follows east for about before turning back to the north. The concurrence with US 23 is the only stretch of US 42 that is categorized as a freeway in Ohio. Heading into Cuyahoga County at Strongsville, US 42 intersects I-80, the Ohio Turnpike, and continues through Middleburg Heights, Parma Heights, and Parma heading into Cleveland and is known locally as Pearl Road. US 42 continues north intersecting with I-71 and nearby exits to I-90. The route is part of the Ohio & Erie Canalway Scenic Byway while continuing north on West 25th. At this point on the route the road is a business district surrounded by varying business and residents of the Ohio City neighborhood. Along this stretch of the route, can be found many historic buildings, including the West Side Market. The last stretch of US 42 is a concurrency with US 6\\\\. The eastern/northern end of US 42 finds its terminus at the intersection of Superior Avenue and Ontario Street in the middle of Public Square in downtown Cleveland. This intersection also serves as the western terminus of US 322 coming from the east on Superior as well as the western termini of US 422, Ohio State Route 14 (SR 14), and SR 87 and the northern terminus of SR 8 coming from the south on Ontario.

Instead of reporting or anchoring the news, Pamela Wallin Live featured Wallin interviewing newsmakers, celebrities and other figures in a format similar to CNN's Larry King Live. The show quickly proved to be one of Newsworld's most popular offerings, and in some seasons was repeated the following afternoon on the CBC's main network as well. In 1998, Newsworld moved the series to a different time slot, and the show no longer aired live. Its title was changed at that time to simply Pamela Wallin. In 1999, Wallin moved the series to CTV's new specialty channel TalkTV, where it became Pamela Wallin's TalkTV. It aired there until 2002, when Wallin accepted a diplomatic posting as Canada's Consul General in New York City.

Terrence William Deacon (born 1950) is an American neuroanthropologist (Ph.D. in Biological Anthropology, Harvard University 1984). He taught at Harvard for eight years, relocated to Boston University in 1992, and is currently Professor of Anthropology and member of the Cognitive Science Faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. Theoretical interests Prof. Deacon's theoretical interests include the study of evolution-like processes at multiple levels, including their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing, language change, social processes, and focusing especially on how these different processes interact and depend on each other. He has long stated an interest in developing a scientific semiotics (particularly biosemiotics) that would contribute to both linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience.http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/users/terrence-w-deacon UC Berkeley faculty profile Fields of research Deacon's research combines human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. His work extends from laboratory-based cellular- molecular neurobiology to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language and language origins. His neurobiological research is focused on determining the nature of the human divergence from typical primate brain anatomy, the cellular-molecular mechanisms producing this difference, and the correlations between these anatomical differences and special human cognitive abilities, again, particularly language. Work His 1997 book, The Symbolic Species: The Co- evolution of Language and the Brain is widely considered a seminal work in the subject of evolutionary cognition. His approach to semiotics, thoroughly described in the book, is fueled by a career-long interest in the ideas of the late 19th-century American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce. In it, he uses the metaphors of parasite and host to describe language and the brain, respectively, arguing that the structures of language have co-evolved to adapt to their brain hosts. His 2011 book, Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter, explores the properties of life, the emergence of consciousness, and the relationship between evolutionary and semiotic processes. The book speculates on how properties such as information, value, purpose, meaning, and end-directed behavior emerged from physics and chemistry. Critics of the book argue that Deacon has drawn heavily from the works of Alicia Juarrero and Evan Thompson without providing full citations or references, but a UC Berkeley investigation exonerated Deacon.Plagiarism Investigation Exonerates Terrence W. Deacon retrieved 5 January 2014 In contrast to the arguments presented by Juarrero in Dynamics of Action (1999, MIT Press) and by Thompson in Mind in Life (2007, Belknap Press and Harvard University Press), Deacon explicitly rejects claims that living or mental phenomena can be explained by dynamical systems approaches.Incomplete Nature, pp. 143-181 Instead, Deacon argues that life- or mind-like properties only emerge from a higher-order reciprocal relationship between self-organizing processes.

He was the leader of one of Portugal's right-wing parties, the CDS – People's Party (CDS-PP) from 1998–2005 and 2007–2016, on whose lists he was elected to the Portuguese Parliament in every legislative election between 1995 and 2015. He was Deputy Prime Minister from 2013 to 2015, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs from 2011 to 2013, and Minister of Defence from 2002 to 2005, all three times in coalitions of the PSD and his CDS-PP. Portas withdrew from politics in 2016. Early life Paulo Portas was born in Lisbon and grew up in Vila Viçosa. His father, Nuno Portas, was an influential post-modernist architect, who professed progressive Roman Catholic views. His mother, Helena Sacadura Cabral was an economist, journalist and author, who held more conservative views that appear to have passed on to Paulo Portas who stayed living with her after his parents separated. In contrast, his older brother Miguel Portas stayed with their father and became a communist and later a leftist. Their half-sister is Catarina Portas, a well-known Portuguese journalist, businesswoman and media personality. Perfil: Portas, o homem para quem fazer previsões em política \\"é um grande atrevimento\\" Público (2 July 2013) Following the 1974 Carnation revolution in Portugal, Paulo Portas was briefly sent to school in France but returned in 1975 to study at Lisbon's top private high school (Colégio S. João de Brito). In 1984 he got a law degree from the Portuguese Catholic University, where he met Manuel Monteiro who, 10 years later, would serve as Portas's stepping stone into the CDS-PP and national politics. Um político que de irrevogável só mesmo a contradição [Diário de Notícias] (12 August 2013) He is said to be a Church-going Catholic.Perfil: Paulo Portas, ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros (17 June 2011) Press career At age 12 in junior high school, Paulo Portas is said to have launched a school newspaper called \\"Laughs and Smiles\\" (Risos e Sorrisos); Paulo Portas e António Pires de Lima Sábado magazine (5 November 2010) it is not known how long it lasted. In his mid-teens (1974–75) he began contributing to the official newspaper of the youth wing of the PSD (which at the time was called Partido Popular Democrático, 'PPD'). The paper was called \\"On Behalf of Socialism\\" (Pelo Socialismo) and Portas became its chief editor. Paulo Portas(Infopédia [Em linha]. Porto: Porto Editora, 2003–2013) As a teen he also began working on the conservative daily A Tarde and weekly O Tempo newspapers and soon his eloquent anti-leftist views earned him guest opinion columns in the few conservative newspapers of post-revolution Lisbon. He first became nationally known at 15 years of age when he wrote a letter-to-the-editor of the daily evening newspaper Jornal Novo that prominently published it under the heading \\"Three Betrayals\\" (\\"Três Traições\\") directly accusing then president Ramalho Eanes, prime minister Mário Soares and foreign minister Diogo Freitas do Amaral of \\"selling out\\" Portugal's African colonies in 1974–75. The article earned him a libel lawsuit from President Eanes and valuable public exposure to get his own weekly opinion column in O Tempo and, some years later, in the new weekly Semanário. Ele ainda se reconhece no Portas do Independente(Publico) (2 February 2011) In 1987, he co-founded, with Miguel Esteves Cardoso, the weekly newspaper O Independente, which started publication in May 1988 and became known for its innovative editorial concepts as well as for denouncing political scandals, often on the basis of little more than hearsay.A Nation Talking to Itself – O Independente (1988–1995)(2012) In reporting such scandals, Portas personally targeted the then prime-minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva and most of his ministers (1985–1995) thus making several enemies in the PSD. Quando Portas escrevia que Cavaco \\"merecia um estalo\\"(Expresso-Revista) (18 May 2013) Although it reached very respectable circulation levels in the 1990s, O Independente never quite reached Portas's stated objective of outselling the leading Portuguese weekly Expresso and eventually folded in 2006. Paulo Portas, o Expresso e O Independente(O Informador) (10 January 2013) In the 1990s Portas became a TV personality appearing regularly on several Portuguese TV channels as a political commentator. He was a sporadic panel member in a popular weekly night TV talk show (Raios e Coriscos) and in the Portuguese edition of Crossfire. In 2006, after his first stint as a government minister, he returned to TV with his own biweekly show (O Estado da Arte) where he commented on current issues. Paulo Portas em O Estado da Arte (Correio da Manhã) (26 February 2006) Political career =The formative years, 1974–85= Paulo Portas showed a precocious interest in politics and as a child engaged in lively political discussions with his elders. In 1975 he joined the youth wing of the Democratic Popular Party (PPD), which in 1976 became PSD Social Democratic Party. He would later profess to have been a staunch follower of PPD's founder Francisco Sá Carneiro, who is said to have relished the views of the 14-year-old Paulo Portas and personally sponsored his full PSD membership in 1978. Sá Carneiro died in 1980 and, following a bitter loss in an internal election of the party's youth-wing JSD, Portas quietly left PSD in 1982. He remained involved with politics through his popular opinion-columns in the conservative weekly newspapers O Tempo and Semanário. =Early political career, 1986–97= Paulo Portas took his first big step into politics in 1986 with his personal endorsement of presidential candidate Diogo Freitas do Amaral, in support of whom Portas, already a well- known media pundit, campaigned with determination. However, Freitas do Amaral lost the election and Portas stepped back from politics to launch the \\"O Independente\\" newspaper project and became its Deputy-Director. By the 1990s he was a widely recognized national figure and stated more than once on TV that he \\"did not want to be a politician\\" Paulo Portas... Nao quer ser politico? but it would later become apparent Quando Paulo Portas transformou o seu jornal num projecto politico? that he was, on the contrary, moving full speed towards becoming Portugal's leading conservative politician. He is credited with helping his former University colleague Manuel Monteiro gain the leadership of the Centro Democrático Social (CDS) party in 1992 and with coming up with new strategies, such as rebranding the CDS as the People's Party (CDS-PP) in line with several of the major conservative European parties.In 1995, Portas formally joined the CDS-PP with the full support of Manuel Monteiro, who put him at the top of the party list in the district of Aveiro thus ensuring that he would become a member of the Portuguese Parliament in that year's legislative elections. In 1997 he ran and was elected member of the municipal chamber of Oliveira de Azeméis. Presidentes do Partido - Paulo Portas =Affirmation as party leader, 1998–2001= In 1998, after the CDS-PP performed poorly in the 1997 local elections, (CNE) (14 December 1997) Portas made his move to control the party by first manoeuvering to get Manuel Monteiro to resign, and then by defeating his hand-picked successor who underestimated Portas by comparing him to Mickey Mouse. CDS á Lupa On 22 March 1998, Portas finally became President of the CDS-PP after a bitter take-over that established Portas's reputation as a cunning politician who does not hesitate to remove those who stand in his way even if they had formerly been his friends or allies. Paulo Portas: Um observador com \\"instinto de matador\\" (Jornal de Negócios) (2 July 2013) Upon taking over the CDS-PP, he immediately sought to energize the party and earn himself name recognition by campaigning in more media-friendly ways and soon became known by his appearances in public events that earned him the nickname \\"Paulie of the Market Fairs\\" (in Portuguese: \\"Paulinho das Feiras\\"). O ‘remake’ do cinéfilo ‘Paulinho das feiras’ He is also said to have brought in political marketing experts to enhance his image and that of the party. He was a leading voice against Portugal's \\"regionalization\\" and \\"legalization of abortion\\" in two 1998 referendums that did not come to pass. Paulo Portas critica Sampaio a propósito da regionalização In 1999, he headed the CDS-PP list to the European Parliament, got elected but only remained in Brussels less than six months. In 2001 he ran for Mayor of Lisbon and was soundly defeated, but got enough votes to be elected member of the City Council. Despite running under the slogan \\"I shall remain\\" (in Portuguese: \\"Eu fico\\"), he left City Council shortly afterwards to focus on the 2002 elections. In 1993, Paulo Portas said of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa that he was an unreliable source for O Independente's, and had given an account of a political VIP dinner that had never taken place going as far as inventing that the soup served during the dinner was Vichyssoise. Se queres ganhar e não tens par: chama o Marcelo Ionline (22 October 2009) Later, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 1999 when he was leader of Portugal's Social Democratic Party (PSD), sought an elections alliance with Paulo Portas's CDS-PP that was initially agreed but collapsed shortly. Marcelo then had to resign from the PSD leadership. As histórias desconhecidas de Marcelo Sábado (28 November 2012) =Minister of Defence, 2002-05= Paulo Portas with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during a visit to the Department of Defense in 2002 when Portas claimed to have seen \\"irrefutable evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction\\" that turned out to never have existed. In the 2002 legislative elections, the CDS-PP won 8.7 percent of the vote and 14 Parliament seats, which were sufficient to form a government majority with the PSD that won the election. (CNE) (17 March 2002) The CDS-PP participated in two coalition governments from April 2002 to March 2005 and Portas served as Minister of State and National Defence in the first (Durão Barroso) and Minister of State, National Defence and Sea Affairs in the second (Pedro Santana Lopes). As Minister of Defence, he presided over important reforms of the military, such as abolishing conscription, Portas satisfeito com o fim do SMO (Diário de Notícias) (20 November 2004) but his most lasting legacy was the upgrade of military equipment in the context of the 2003 \\"Military Programming Law\\" Lei Orgânica n.º1/2003 (Diário da República)(23 May 2003) that envisaged a major boost in military equipment spending to 5,341 million euros, Cavaco dá apoio ao investimento militar (Correio da Manhã)(23 May 2006) including two submarines and 260 combat vehicles that would become the subject of much controversy after he left office. As Minister of Defense, Paulo Portas was also determinant in aligning Portugal with George W. Bush's 2003 Iraq invasion by saying he had personally \\"seen irrefutable evidence of weapons of mass destruction\\" while on an official visit to Washington. He was subsequently awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service by the USA's Defense Department.Paulo Portas' CV (European Parliament)(20 March 2007) =Back in Parliament, 2006–11= In the 2005 early elections, the two incumbent coalition parties suffered a crushing defeat, with CDS-PP losing 60,000 votes and two of its fourteen seats in Parliament. Paulo Portas assumed the responsibility for the defeat and resigned from the party leadership but not from his seat in parliament. He failed to get his preferred successor (Telmo Correia) elected, but some of his staunchest party allies managed to remain in control of the party's Directorate (the \\"National Congress\\") Ribeiro e Castro é o novo presidente do CDS-PP (TVI online)(25 April 2005) setting the stage for Paulo Portas to return in 2007 in what his brief successor José Ribeiro e Castro called \\"a coup d'etat.\\" Ribeiro e Castro aceita ir a directas se Conselho Nacional assim o entender (Público)(29 March 2007) Paulo Portas had accused Ribeiro Castro of being an ineffective absentee leader (for keeping his post at the European Parliament) and called for party elections open to all CDS-PP supporters gambling that he would capture the support of the less involved party members. Ribeiro e Castro questioned the legality of Portas' challenge but, in April 2007, he was soundly defeated by Portas who got 70% of the militants' votes and would remain as CDS-PP president until 2016. Portas regressa em força à liderança (Correio da Manhã)(21 April 2007) For the next six years, Paulo Portas led his party in the opposition to the ruling Socialist Party (PS). His new strategy for the party was to focus on a few major issues (such as agriculture, tax cuts, fuel prices) in order for CDS-PP to retain conservative voters, who, in the past, supported CDS-PP but voted PSD at election time. CDS diz que a agricultura é prioridade \\"absoluta\\" da próxima legislatura Ionline (18 July 2009) In 2009 he personally ran for local office in the small municipality of Arouca (population: 20,000) and was elected to the Municipal Assembly significantly boosting CDS-PP's votes in the region. Arouca- CDS reforçado na Assembleia Municipal graças a Paulo Portas [Diário de Notícias] (12 October 2009) In 2006–07, just prior to regaining the party leadership, Paulo Portas again had been a leading 'No!' voice against the legalization of abortion in Portugal in the 2007 referendum that was won by the \\"Yes!\\" vote that reversed the \\"No!\\" outcome of the 1998 referendum. Paulo Portas em campanha sobre aborto (TVI online)(16 January 2007) =Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, 2011–13= Paulo Portas with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a visit to the State Department in 2011 to discuss Middle East and EU affairs. In the 2011 elections, Portas's opposition strategies paid off and the CDS-PP achieved its best result in 30 years: 11.7% of the total vote. The winning party, the PSD, needed the CDS-PP to reach a parliamentary majority and the two parties formed a coalition government. By his own choice, Portas became Minister of State and of Foreign Affairs and secured two more minister slots for the CDS-PP, including the Minister of Agriculture position for his youthful female protegée Assunção Cristas, who would five years later succeed Portas in the CDS-PP party's leadership. As minister, Portas chose (and relished) Mário Soares: \\"Portas deve demitir-se\\"(Expresso) (9 October 2012) devoting himself fully to performing his official functions, in particular traveling abroad. He made his priority what he called \\"economic diplomacy\\", Paulo Portas e o primado da diplomacia económica(Sol)(2 July 2013) meaning the generation through diplomacy of business opportunities abroad for Portuguese companies. Portas à Exame: \\"Não quero a troika cá para lá de junho de 2014\\" (Expresso)(2 July 2013) To that effect, he wrestled control of the Portuguese Foreign Investment and Trade Agency (AICEP) from the Ministry of Economics. Portas mantém diplomacia económica(Expresso) (25 July 2013) In 2013, to attract foreign investments, Paulo Portas instituted \\"golden visas\\" to make it possible for non-EU foreigners to obtain Portuguese residency if they invested at least 500,000 euros in Portuguese real estate. Governo concedeu 145 vistos dourados num investimento superior a 90 milhões de euros(Jornal de Negócios) (3 September 2013) By focusing on his duties as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he also managed to distance himself from the difficult decisions related to Portugal's economic austerity program. More than once he kept silent or expressed his disagreement with unpopular measures taken by the government to which he belonged, O ministro que faz sombra(Jornal de Noticias) (8 July 2012) and on 2 July 2013 he abruptly resigned in protest at the appointment of a Finance Minister (Maria Luís Albuquerque) he did not approve of, a decision he called \\"irrevocable\\" but that he subsequently revoked. =Deputy Prime- Minister, 2013–15= When Paulo Portas resigned from the government in July 2013, Prime-Minister Passos Coelho feared the end of his coalition government and negotiated with Paulo Portas his permanence in a higher capacity as Deputy Prime-Minister with oversight over economic issues. Paulo Portas also obtained control of the Ministry of Economics where he placed two close associates: minister António Pires de Lima (his close childhood friend) and state secretary Adolfo Mesquita Nunes (his youthful protégé in the CDS-PP party Público (Portugal) (31 January 2013)). In control of the key ministries of Economics, Agriculture, Labor and Social Security (held by his CDS-PP ministers), Paulo Portas came to wield political power far beyond the 12% of the national vote his party received in the 2011 elections. Edite Estrela: \\"Portas é o político mais poderoso do país\\" (Expresso) (27 April 2013) As part of his Deputy Prime-Minister attributions, Paulo Portas took charge of the negotiations on Portugal’s IMF/EC/ECB-supported program, the terms of which he had publicly declared to be against. However, his only visible act of defiance was the setting up, in December 2013, of a \\"countdown clock\\" showing the time remaining until the expiration of the program on 17 May 2014. Portas inaugura um relógio com contagem decrescente para a saída da troika do país (SIC Notícias) (15 December 2013) Through the rest of his mandate that ended in 2015, he raised no major new policy proposals or objections in his capacity as Deputy Prime-Minister, choosing instead to use his economic policy oversight position to travel the world promoting Portuguese companies and products in what appears to have been a continuation of the \\"economic diplomacy\\" priority he had established as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Paulo Portas e Pires de Lima lideram missão ao México (Expresso) (26 October 2014) In 2015 Paulo Portas agreed to an electoral alliance between his CDS-PP party and its government coalition partner PSD party as to jointly maximize their numbers of elected members of Parliament in 4 October 2015 Portuguese legislative elections. The alliance (PAF, Portugal in Front) came first in the elections but fell short of a parliamentary majority. Despite upfront opposition from the new majority-holding parties, the PAF alliance accepted to form a minority government and Paulo Portas was re-conducted on 30 October 2015 as Deputy Prime Minister of Portugal's XX Constitutional Government. However, he stayed in office less than a month as his government's program was predictably rejected in Parliament and replaced by a Socialist Party government supported by the far-left parties. =Retirement from CDS-PP Party Leadership, 2016= Having ceased his functions as Deputy Prime-Minister on 26 November 2015, Paulo Portas presented himself in Parliament the following day to take up the position for which he had been elected on 4 October by the Lisbon electoral district. Público (27 November 2015) However, one month later (28 Dec. 2015) he announced his resignation from the CDS-PP Party leadership and from his elected position in Parliament on the grounds that \\"it was time for a new political cycle (...) and for a new generation\\" to take over the party leadership. Público (28 December 2015) Accordingly, on March 13 2016, Paulo Portas stepped down in acclaim at a special convention of his CDS-PP party where he was replaced by his longtime protegée and former government colleague Assunção Cristas. Shortly afterwards, he became vice-president of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce—a non-remunerated position that allowed him to continue traveling to promote Portuguese enterprises abroad as he had been doing in the government. He left Parliament in June 2016 to return to political commentary on TV with a weekly show on TVI Portugal. Controversies =Ministry of Defence= The historic fort of São Julião da Barra where Paulo Portas took up residence upon becoming Minister of Defense. In 2002, Portas became Minister of Defence and made a historic seafront fort of São Julião da Barra his \\"official residence\\". O ESCUDO DO REINO, A FORTALEZA DE S. JULIÃO DA BARRA Operacional online (11 October 2011) Paulo Portas was the first Minister of Defence to openly move into the fort, which resulted in the closing of most of the historic monument to the public and in new remodeling and upkeep costs for Portas's occupancy. He defended his move to the fort as \\"a gain for the State.\\" Forte S. Julião é um «ganho para o Estado» TSF online (1 June 2002) Upon becoming Minister of Defence in 2002, Paulo Portas also rescinded a previous contract for the purchase of nine EC-635 helicopters from European manufacturer Eurocopter Group on the grounds that the helicopters had not been delivered when stipulated.World Business Briefing  Europe: Portugal: Helicopter Order Canceled The New York Times (15 August 2002) He then considered rescinding another existing contract for the purchase of twelve helicopters NH-90, manufactured by Nato Helicopters Industries (a subsidiary of Eurocopter Group) and buy American-made Blackhawk helicopters instead Helicópteros causam braço-de-ferro entre Exército e Governo Público (3 December 2003) but he eventually authorized the NH-90 helicopters purchase in the amount of 420 million euros. Exército perde helicópteros Expresso (30 June 2012) Paulo Portas then went ahead with the purchase of twelve EH101 helicopters from manufacturer AgustaWestland at a total cost of 300 million euros for Portugal. Portugal vai receber em Junho de 2004 o primeiro helicóptero EH 101 Público (15 November 2002) However the purchase price for the EH101s did not include their maintenance, which subsequently added an extra 120 million euros to the price and raised questions on whether the helicopter deals were in the best interests of Portugal both in terms of the high cost and the multiple configurations.

It was discovered on 16 February 1986, by Japanese astronomer Minoru Kizawa at Shizuoka Observatory, Japan. 1986 DA was the first near Earth asteroid thought to be of metallic composition, with high radar brightness; with that it was predicted to have 100 thousand tons of platinum group metals including gold and suggested as a resource for future space colonists.  Orbit and classification  As an eccentric Amor asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of and approaches the orbit of Earth from the outside but does not cross it. It crosses however the orbit of Mars and can be classified as a Mars-crosser and also approaches the orbit of Jupiter within 0.5 AU. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.5 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,732 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 9 years prior to its discovery.  Physical characteristics  The metallic M-type asteroid is notable for being significantly more radar-reflective than other asteroids. Radar measurements suggest it is composed of nickel and iron and that it was derived from the center of a much larger object that experienced melting and differentiation. The observed radar albedo was 0.58 and the optical albedo was 0.14. = Rotation and shape = It was most probably formed from a larger body through a catastrophic collision with another object. Radar measurements of this body indicate that the surface is relatively smooth on scales of less than a meter, but it is highly irregular on scales of 10-100 meters. Several lightcurve analysis gave it a concurring rotation period of 3.50 to 3.51 hours with a relatively high brightness amplitude between 0.03 and 0.48 in magnitude, indicating an irregular shape (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.08 and 0.16, and a diameter of 3.1 to 3.2 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link selects 3.15 kilometers as best result, while the first estimate from 1994 gave a diameter of 2.3 kilometers. = Mining considerations = The asteroid achieved its most notable recognition when scientists revealed that it contained over \\"10,000 tons of gold and 100,000 tons of platinum\\", or an approximate value at the time of its discovery of \\"$90 billion for the gold and a cool trillion dollars for the platinum, plus loose change for the asteroid's 10 billion tons of iron and a billion tons of nickel.\\" In 2012 the estimated value of 100,000 tons of platinum was worth approximately five trillion US dollars. The delta-v for a spacecraft rendezvous with this asteroid from low earth orbit is 7.1 km/s.

Then, they cross over the Tennessee River on the O'Neal Bridge and enter Lauderdale County. ;Lauderdale County The US 43/US 72/SR 13/SR 17/SR 20 concurrency immediately enters Florence. It has an incomplete interchange where SR 20 leaves the concurrency to the west-southwest on Coffee Road. There is no access from SR 20 to US 43 north/US 72 east/SR 13 north/SR 17 north. The highways turn right onto East Dr. Hicks Boulevard and travel to the east-northeast and then to the northeast. The four highways curve back to the east-northeast onto East Tennessee Street. They curve to the north- northwest and travel on an overpass over North Royal Avenue. They begin to curve to the northeast and travel on an overpass over Railroad Avenue, some railroad tracks of CSX, and an unnamed stream. Immediately after this overpass is an interchange with SR 157 (Helton Drive). At this interchange, SR 17 departs the concurrency and heads northwest with SR 157\\\\. US 43, US 72, and SR 13 pass University of North Alabama's North campus. They pass historic Sweetwater Mansion and curve to the east-northeast. After that, they intersect SR 133 (Cox Creek Parkway). A short distance later is an intersection with CR 61 (Middle Road). A few blocks later is an intersection with the southern terminus of CR 374 Just under later is an intersection with the southern terminus of CR 323 (Bailey Springs Road). The highways have an intersection with the southern terminus of CR 27, which leads to the Boy Scouts of America's Camp Westmoreland. One block later is an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 367 (Lakeview Drive). After they leave Florence, they cross over Shoal Creek on the Disabled American Veterans Memorial Bridge. Just west-southwest of Killen, US 72 continues to the east-northeast, while US 43 and SR 13 head to the northeast. The concurrency briefly travels along the northwest edge of Killen before they temporarily leave the town. A short distance later, they travel through the far northwestern corner of the city limits of Killen before leaving the town for good. They intersect the southern terminus of CR 63 and the northern terminus of Alabama Street. The concurrency curves to the north and have an unsigned concurrency with CR 170\\\\. One block later is an intersection with the southern terminus of CR 36\\\\. A short distance later, they intersect the western terminus of CR 396 and then CR 394 in close succession. Approximately later, they intersect CR 73\\\\. One block later is an intersection with the western terminus of CR 392\\\\. Approximately another later, is an intersection with the eastern terminus of CR 387\\\\. One block later is an intersection with the eastern terminus of CR 364 and the western terminus of SR 64\\\\. Approximately yet another later is an intersection with CR 34\\\\. Approximately later is a brief unsigned concurrency with CR 47, which leads to St. Florian. US 43 and SR 13 curve to the north-northeast and intersect CR 38\\\\. Approximately later is an intersection with CR 140\\\\. They then intersect the eastern terminus of CR 344 and then CR 8\\\\. Farther to the north-northeast is an intersection with CR 130 (South Old Military Road). Approximately later is an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 47\\\\. They cross over Shakerag Branch and travel another before reaching the Tennessee state line, where SR 13 ends. =Tennessee= US 43 enters Lawrence County and the city limits of Saint Joseph. The unsigned State Route 6 (SR 6) begins at the state line. In the main part of the city, US 43 begins an unsigned concurrency with SR 227 (Iron City Road). They curve to the northeast, leave Saint Joseph, and enter Loretto. There, SR 227 splits off to the southeast onto East Main Street. Then, US 43 intersects SR 98 (Rabbit Trail Road) in Leoma. It has an interchange with US 64 (unsigned SR 15; Lawrenceburg Highway) in Lawrenceburg. In downtown Lawrenceburg, US 43 intersects US 64 Bus. (Gaines Street). The highway briefly parallels the North Fork Buffalo River before beginning a curve to the north and crossing that river twice. Then, US 43 intersects SR 240 (Monument Road) and Spring Water Drive. In Maury County, US 43 intersects SR 20\\\\. It intersects the southern terminus of SR 243 (South Main Street) in Mount Pleasant. It travels on an overpass over Mt. Joy Road and some railroad tracks. US 43 bypasses downtown by traveling through the western part of the city. It intersects SR 166 (1st Avenue). Then, it has an interchange with SR 243, which also leads to the Maury County Airport. It has an interchange with US 412 (unsigned SR 99) and the western terminus of US 412 Bus. (Hampshire Pike) in Columbia. At this interchange, US 43 and US 412 travel concurrently to the north-northeast. At an interchange with SR 50 (Williamsport Pike), the concurrency briefly re- enters the city before leaving again. The concurrency curves to the east- southeast and has an interchange with SR 7 (Santa Fe Pike). Then, they intersect US 31 and US 412 Bus (Nashville Highway). Here, US 43 ends, US 412 continues to the east-southeast on Bear Creek Pike, and SR 6 turns left onto US 31 north. =National Highway System= All of US 43, except for the approximately segment from the interchange with I-20/I-59 south of Knoxville to just northeast of its entering Tuscaloosa, is part of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of highways determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History Prior to the completion of Corridor X in western Alabama, US 43 and US 278 shared a concurrency with US 78 between Guin and Hamilton. The highway formerly extended to Henderson, Kentucky. It was concurrent with I-24, I-65, the Pennyrile Parkway, and what is now I-69. This part of US 43 was decommissioned when US 41 Alt. came into existence. US 43 was rerouted to run the southern and eastern portions of the Downtown Loop in Nashville. The old route through became a business route of US 43. Like US 43 in Kentucky, this business route was decomissioned when US 43 was truncated to Columbia. Future Preliminary talks have indicated that Alabama state officials support a plan to upgrade US 43 to Interstate Highway standards from the Mobile metropolitan area to the I-20/I-59 interchange in Knoxville, Alabama (southwest of Tuscaloosa). However, no number has been specified. The plan is estimated to cost roughly $1.6 billion. The project is expected to help the economies of cities in the Black Belt by connecting communities in western Alabama, the Port of Mobile, I-65, and I-20/I-59.

The magazine features interviews, equipment reviews, and columns offering advice on technique, as well as information for the general public. Modern Drummer is also available on the internet. First published in 1977, today the print version of Modern Drummer is available in 67 countries. The monthly digital edition, enhanced with music and videos corresponding to the current issue's contents, is available on the internet. An electronic newsletter featuring unique editorial, MD Wire, is also published monthly. A corresponding website is used to supplement the magazine with blogs and other items which cannot be provided in the paper format (e.g., audio-video presentations). In 1993 Modern Drummer Publications introduced a bimonthly drum dealer-oriented magazine called Drum Business, and for more than 20 years its book division has released works by drum educators. In 2006 the company published its first hardcover book on the history of drumming, entitled The Drummer: 100 Years Of Rhythmic Power And Invention. Since 1987 it has also produced the Modern Drummer Festival. History Modern Drummer magazine was conceived in the basement of Ron and Isabel Spagnardi's home in Nutley, New Jersey, funded only with the family's personal savings. The magazine's initial staff consisted of Leo Spagnardi (Ron's father, who taught him how to play the drums), and Ron and Isabel's daughter, Lori. Although they had no real publication experience or financial backing, the Spagnardis placed ads in local newspapers, in Downbeat, and in Drum World.Mark Small, \\"Alum Profile - Ron Spagnardi '63\\", Berklee College of Music (accessed 2014-07-19). \\"What we didn’t consider when we put the ads in the papers,\\" recalled Isabel in The Drummer, \\"was that we were innocently breaking the law by advertising a product that didn’t even exist yet!\\" The ads worked, however, and subscriptions began coming in as the first issue was still being laid out on the Spagnardis’ ping-pong table. Ron contributed most of the magazine's content, writing the majority of the articles on an old typewriter under various pen names. Within two years, the Spagnardis’ basement could no longer provide the necessary space and so moved to its first proper office in Clifton, New Jersey. By 1984, the magazine once again outgrew its headquarters and moved to a larger facility in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. Ten years later, it moved to an even larger facility in the same town. Modern Drummer’s offices remain at 12 Old Bridge Road in Cedar Grove today. Ron Spagnardi died on September 22, 2003.\\"Ron Spagnardi.(Deaths)\\", The Music Trades, November 1, 2003 David Frangioni became Publisher in 2019 and then CEO/Owner in 2020. Drum Business and book publishing In 1993 Modern Drummer Publications introduced Drum Business, a magazine dedicated to the needs of drum retailers. The bi-monthly publication features interviews with drum sellers, press releases for new products, drum-industry news, articles and news such as on the annual National Association of Merchant Musicians (NAMM) convention. Among the books Modern Drummer Publications has released are titles by well-known drummers such as Gary Chester, Carl Palmer and Bill Bruford. Ron Spagnardi authored more than a dozen books.

It was created by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1925. The model Based on human ecology theory done by Burgess and applied on Chicago, it was the first to give the explanation of distribution of social groups within urban areas. This concentric ring model depicts urban land usage in concentric rings: the Central Business District (or CBD) was in the middle of the model, and the city is expanded in rings with different land uses. It is effectively an urban version of Von Thünen's regional land use model developed a century earlier.Jean-Paul Rodrigue, Urban Land Use Models in Urban Land Use and Transportation It influenced the later development of Homer Hoyt's sector model (1939) and Harris and Ullman's multiple nuclei model (1945). The zones identified are: # The center with the central business district, # The transition zone of mixed residential and commercial uses or the zone of transition, # Working class residential homes (inner suburbs), in later decades called inner city or zone of independent working men's home, # Better quality middle-class homes (outer suburbs) or zone of better housing, # Commuter zone. The model is more detailed than the traditional down-mid-uptown divide by which downtown is the CBD, uptown the affluent residential outer ring, and midtown in between. Bid rent curve Burgess's work helped generate the bid rent curve. This theory states that the concentric circles are based on the amount that people will pay for the land. This value is based on the profits that are obtainable from maintaining a business on that land. The center of the town will have the highest number of customers so it is profitable for retail activities. Manufacturing will pay slightly less for the land as they are only interested in the accessibility for workers, 'goods in' and 'goods out'. Residential land use will take the surrounding land. Criticisms The model has been challenged by many contemporary urban geographers. First, the model does not work well with cities outside the United States, in particular with those developed under different historical contexts. Even in the United States, because of changes such as advancement in transportation and information technology and transformation in global economy, cities are no longer organized with clear \\"zones\\" (see: Los Angeles School of Urban Analysis). * It describes the peculiar American geography, where the inner city is poor while suburbs are wealthy; the converse is the norm elsewhere. * It assumes an isotropic plane – an even, unchanging landscape. ** Physical features – land may restrict growth of certain sectors; hills and water features may make some locations unusually desirable for residential purposes. * Commuter villages defy the theory, being a distant part of the commuter zone. * Decentralization of shops, manufacturing industry (see Industrial suburb), and entertainment. * Urban regeneration and gentrification – more expensive property can be found in formerly 'low class' housing areas. * Many new housing estates were built on the edges of cities in Britain. * It does not address local urban politics and forces of globalization. * The model does not fit polycentric cities, for example Stoke- on-Trent.

He held the riding from 2004 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2019. He is a member of the Liberal Party. Background Wrzesnewskyj was born in Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada (now a part of Toronto). He is a third-generation Ukrainian Canadian, of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, and partly Polish from paternal family. He attended Humber Valley Village Public School and Upper Canada College. He received a Bachelor of Commerce from Trinity College, University of Toronto and has been a member of Plast. He speaks English, Ukrainian, Polish, French, and Spanish. He is the owner of Future Bakery, founded by his grandparents, and M-C Dairy.

Through Future Bakery, Wrzesnewskyj was one of the original sponsors of the Out of the Cold program to aid the homeless and numerous other charitable organizations working in a number of Toronto's most challenging neighbourhoods. In the late 1980s he helped organize and finance the nascent Rukh Movement (People's Movement of Ukraine). In 1991, financed and organized a group in support of the referendum for the independence of Ukraine. One of his projects was an underground printing press which produced and distributed several million pieces of pro- independence literature in the South and East of Ukraine. Throughout the 1990s, he was involved with various civil society and humanitarian projects in Ukraine, such as the building of libraries and providing scholarships for gifted students. Through his family foundation, Wrzesnewskyj has provided funding support for the following: * The Ukraine Transparency and Election Monitoring Project to train independent election scrutineers in Ukraine. * The Ukraine List electronic periodical of the Chair of Ukrainian Studies (University of Ottawa) targeting policy specialists and academics. * The delivery of Ukrainian News to every MP and Senator in Canada's Parliament. * The publication and delivery of Ukraine Analyst to members of the Canada- Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. * Ukrainian courses at The Centre for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (CERES) at the University of Toronto. * Grants for archival research into Ukrainian national movements during World War II. * The republication of books about Ukrainians who perished in the Holocaust. * Archival research into victims of the Holocaust and Soviet terror in the Sambir region of Ukraine. * Donated $500,000 to build the Ukrainian Canadian Care Centre (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). * Annually sponsored an intern from Ukraine to participate in an internship program in Canada's Parliament (Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Program). * Donated $250,000 to finance election observers for the first round of voting in Ukraine. * Self- funded missions to Sudan, Darfur, Somalia, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. * Lead the Ukrainian Canadian community's fundraising effort for famine relief in Somalia during the 2011 Horn of Africa famine, with $100,000 committed. * Donated $100,000 to the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv, Ukraine.Canadian philanthropist donates $1.2 million to Lviv Catholic University.

University of Toronto Faculty of Arts & Science, January 13, 2011. Additionally, each Christmas and New Year's Day, he donates his time by delivering toys and gifts to children in community housing projects in Etobicoke Centre. Politics Wrzesnewskyj was actively involved in the Canadian delegation to the contested Ukrainian election of 2004, Orange Revolution, and has often spoken to Canadian media on its behalf. Then, Canadian Prime Minister, Paul Martin said that he was personally briefed by him to publicly warn Russian President Vladimir Putin \\"hands off the Ukrainian election\\" in the House of Commons of Canada which fundamentally shifted Canada's position (Wrzesnewskyj telephoned Martin from Kiev during the Orange Revolution). Originally, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade in Ottawa took a \\"hands off\\" approach to the contested Ukrainian election. Martin says that he, and the Government of Canada would not have stood up for democracy in Ukraine \\"if it hadn't been for Borys\\". Subsequently, he was instrumental in securing the Government of Canada's commitment to sending five hundred Canadian election observers to the December 2004 Presidential elections in Ukraine. =Legislative work= His House of Commons legislative work saw the introduction of several private member's bills and motions including: * Bill C-180, \\"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (hate propaganda)\\", 6 May 2009; Bill C-181, \\"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking and transplanting human organs and other body parts)\\", 7 May 2009. * Bill C-383, \\"An Act respecting education benefits for spouses and children of certain deceased federal enforcement officers\\", 12 May 2009. * Bill C-394 \\"An Act to acknowledge that persons of Croatian origin were interned in Canada during the First World War and to provide for recognition of this event\\", 26 May 2009. This began as his Private Members' Bill C-374, which the Winnipeg Sun placed this item in its top ten list of bills (9 November 2006). * Bill C-450, \\"An Act respecting a national day of remembrance of the Ukrainian Holodomor-Genocide\\". * Bill C-537, \\"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial interim release for offenses involving firearms)\\" to toughen up bail conditions for perpetrators of crimes involving guns, June 2010. Regarding Bill C-181, Wrzesnewskyj gave a press conference in Ottawa together with David Matas and David Kilgour, authors of \\"Bloody Harvest: Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China\\". While saying that \\"consumers benefit from trade with China\\", and that \\"Canada would like to do more trade with China\\", he asserted \\"it does not exonerate us for addressing the issue of Organ transplantation in China\\" and questioned \\"trusting a country that would engage in this sort of horrific crime against its own people.\\" Wrzesnewskyj helped pass MP James Bezan's Bill C-459, An Act to establish a Ukrainian Famine and Genocide Memorial Day and to recognize the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33 as an act of genocide, at all stages through the House of Commons and Senate. He also worked with MP Bob Rae to introduce and help pass unanimously through the House of Commons the Black Ribbon Day motion establishing an annual Canadian Day of Remembrance for the victims of Nazi and Soviet Communist regimes on August 23, called \\"Black Ribbon Day\\", to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the infamous pact between the Nazi and Soviet Communist regimes. =Committees - House of Commons= In 2010, Wrzesnewskyj served as vice-chair on two committees: (1) Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, (2) Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure on the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. Between 2004 and 2010, he served as member on eleven committees, including Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and Standing Committee on Transport among others.PARLINFO - Parliamentarian File - Federal Experience - WRZESNEWSKYJ, Borys, B.Comm Wrzesnewskyj discussed the importance of Ukraine's accession to NATO at meetings of the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe parliamentary assembly meetings and official meetings of NATO member states. He was later selected as an official member of the delegation of the Speaker of the House of Commons to Ukraine (a trip geared toward developing relations between Canada and Ukraine). He helped the previous Canadian government to negotiate and sign the historic agreement for $12.5 million with the Ukrainian Canadian community for the acknowledgement, commemoration and, education of Canadians of the dark episode of internment operations against Ukrainian Canadians. =International self-financed fact- finding missions= From 7–14 August 2009, Wrzesnewskyj initiated in a self- financed fact-finding mission to Jordan, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem along with fellow parliamentarians from the New Democratic Party and Bloc Québécois. The mission's goals were to gain firsthand knowledge and understanding and assess the opportunities to build towards a peaceful and just solution between Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. He subsequently co-authored a report which offered several key recommendations to the Government of Canada. He also a self-financed fact-finding mission to Darfur, Sudan, regarding the Darfur Conflict, and another to Somalia. =RCMP pension scandal= In April 2007, Wrzesnewskyj publicly called for a full judicial inquiry into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) pension fund scandal and spoke to the media on the matter. He was instrumental in bringing forward to the Public Accounts Committee, and pursuing, an investigation into the misuse of the RCMP pension and insurance funds involving the upper echelons of Canada's national police force which pressured the government into establishing the Task Force on Governance and Cultural Change in the RCMP. Here again, Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin emphatically stated that \\"nothing would not have been done (with the RCMP pension scandal) if it hadn't been for Borys.\\" =Hezbollah comments= In August 2006, Wrzesnewskyj said that the Canadian government should engage in talks with militant organizations, including Hezbollah, for the purpose of ending the 2006 Israel- Lebanon conflict.Andrew Mills, \\"MPs tour Lebanon areas,\\" Toronto Star, 21 August 2006, A01. There were some media reports in this period that Wrzesnewskyj called for Hezbollah to be taken off Canada's list of terrorist organizations. He responded that this was a misrepresentation of his position, saying, \\"on the contrary, Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and I stated that it must remain on Canada's list because it has committed war crimes by sending rockets into civilian areas.\\" He added that Canadian law should be amended to permit political and diplomatic contact for the purposes of ending the conflict.Jeff Sallot, \\"Hezbollah to stay on banned list,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 August 2006, A7. As the result of media perceptions about his comments, he resigned his post as foreign affairs critic.Campbell Clark. Divisions on Mideast alarming Liberals. Globe and Mail. August 23, 2006. pg. A4. He would later be critic for Crown Corporations for most of 2007. =Special Advisor to the Liberal Leader on Emerging Democracies= From 2009-11, Wrzesnewskyj held the position of Special Advisor to the Liberal Leader on Emerging Democracies.Borys Wrzesnewskyj appointed Special Advisor to the Liberal Leader on Emerging Democracies . Liberal Party of Canada news release. October 8, 2009. As a Canadian parliamentarian of partial Polish heritage, Wrzesnewskyj is the founder of the Canada-Poland Parliamentary Friendship Group. He has persistently criticized Canadian Minister of Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney for reducing immigration quotas from Poland, and Ukraine to Canada. He has also spoken to Canadian media on the Katyn Massacre and 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash that saw the deaths of Poland's senior government, diplomatic and military leaders, including President Lech Kaczynski. In April 2010, with the President of the Canadian Jewish Congress Mark Freiman, Wrzesnewskyj organized a symposium featuring Meylakh Sheykhet, director of the Union of Councils for Jews of the former Soviet Union in Ukraine, on the importance of Ukrainian-Jewish relations in a historical and current geopolitical context.Ukraine’s Vanquished Jews: Daunting struggle to preserve Jewish heritage. Kyiv Post, July 14, 2011. Again in December 2010, Wrzesnewskyj and Mustafa Jemilev (Dzhemilev) spoke out about the potential for ethnic conflict in Crimea between Russians, Tartars, and Ukrainians. =2011 election= In the 2011 election, Wrzesnewskyj was defeated by Conservative candidate Ted Opitz by a margin of just 26 votes.\\"Recount confirms Tory win in Etobicoke Centre\\". Toronto Star, May 23, 2011. A judicial recount subsequently confirmed Opitz's victory. Nearly a year after the election, allegations of an election dirty tricks campaign linked to the Conservative Harper government persists.Opposition parties slam election dirty tricks. The Record, February 23, 2012.NDP question 2011 election results amidst robocall investigation. Global News, February 23, 2012. At a news conference on 25 February 2012, interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae said that Wrzesnewskyj will be going to court on 2 May 2012 to call for a by-election. Wrzesnewskyj will be alleging that there were irregularities at ten polls in the riding of Etobicoke Centre.Defeated Liberal takes rare court action to contest election results. Global News, February 28, 2012. =After the 2011 election= Despite the narrow loss in the May 2011 election, Wrzesnewskyj has continued dedicating himself to public service. This includes the closure of the immigration case of Arjan Tabaj, championed by Wrzesnewskyj and immigration lawyer Scott McDonald. Tabaj is a partly paralyzed survivor of an assassination attempt during elections in Albania. In September 2011, Tabaj, his wife Anilda, his daughter and twin sons returned to Canada after Jason Kenney had the family deported in 2009. Later, a Canadian federal court ruled that the family was wrongfully deported.Family wrongfully deported to Albania returning to Canada. CityNews, September 22, 2011. Lorne Waldman, a leading immigration lawyer said that stark reversals like the Tabaj case \\"are rarer than hen's teeth\\". After the arrest of Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko in August 2011, Wrzesnewskyj participated in demonstrations at the Ukrainian Consulate in Toronto, calling for the support of democracy in Ukraine and release of all political prisoners. International organizations, representatives of the European Union and the United States called Tymoshenko's arrest \\"selective prosecution of political opponents\\". In August 2011, Wrzesnewskyj led the Ukrainian Canadian community's fundraising effort for famine relief in Somalia, i.e. 2011 Horn of Africa famine, with $100,000 committed, mostly from one donor, entrepreneur and Northland Power founder Jim Temerty, \\"whose family roots go back to one of the regions that was worst affected in the Holodomor\\". In December 2011, Wrzesnewskyj participated in a demonstration outside the Russian consulate in Toronto. He spoke against election fraud in the 2011 Russian parliamentary elections, advocated for democracy in Russia, warned against Putinism, and called for the government of Canada to state that \\"Canada stands 'shoulder to shoulder' with the people of Russia, and not with Putin or the Kremlin.\\" =Potential Liberal leadership campaign in 2013= After the Liberal Party suffered their worst defeat in history under Michael Ignatieff in the May 2, 2011 federal election, and the previous defeat of Stéphane Dion in 2008, party loyalists have objected to Liberal Party decision makers who reflexively promote and support high-profile or star leadership candidates. Supporters have quietly urged Wrzesnewskyj to run for the 2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election. Wresnewskyj's appeal for a successful leadership bid includes his refusal to play \\"back room politics\\", seen as a key factor in rejuvenating the Liberal Party. Referring to Michael Ignatieff and inner Liberal party circles at his annual general meeting in January 2011, Wrzesnewskyj said \\"They can't buy me, they can't silence me, so I remain a pain in their side.\\" In his first major interview since the May 2011 election, Wrzesnewskyj stated \\"it would be such a shame to lose the Liberal Party of Canada as a consequence of being highjacked by a so-called party establishment.\\"Rogue Liberal Readies Leadership Bid. Epoch Times, September 29, 2011. Tackling the RCMP pension scandal wide open in early 2007 through the Public Accounts Committee when \\"fellow MPs had warned him it could cost him his career\\"Former MP Says Ignatieff Quashed Chinese Influence Questions. Epoch Times, September 27, 2011. is seen as another example of Wrzesnewskyj's leadership appeal. Previously, Ignatieff stopped Wrzesnewskyj \\"from calling witnesses and submitting evidence in a parliamentary hearing... that would have pointed to Chinese influence on Canadian politicians.\\" In 2005, when Paul Martin served as Prime Minister, Wrzesnewskyj supported a Conservative MP Daryl Kramp's private members bill for mandatory minimums for gun crimes. He described the events in a Virtual Town Hall meeting on 20 March 2011. Initially, Wrzesnewskyj was instructed by the Liberal leadership to oppose the bill. He refused on a matter of principle stating \\"If you use a gun, you're done. The moment you become a risk to the security of our neighbourhoods and communities, that's it\\". He eventually convinced his Liberal colleagues on the merits of the bill and cast the deciding ballot for the Conservative bill to go forward. Wrzesnewskyj stated that \\"Party elite needs to be ousted\\" and that he \\"is hoping to \\"unwedge the backroom boys\\" and open the party up through a grassroots effort to sign up new members. If all goes according to plan, it could lead to a run for the Liberal leadership.\\" =Supreme Court of Canada case= Wrzesnewskyj challenged the election results of May 2, 2011 in the Etobicoke Centre. Early in 2012, he launched his case in the Ontario Court of Justice, arguing voting irregularities, including ballots cast by people who did not live in the riding, the possibility that at least some people voted multiple times, and mistakes made in the conduct of the election by Elections Canada. On May 18, Justice Thomas Lederer agreed with Wrzesnewskyj, declaring the election results null and void, and ordered a by-election in Etobicoke Centre.

History  It was founded in Hull in 1921 as the Confédération des travailleurs catholiques du Canada (Catholic Workers Confederation of Canada). It became the CSN only in 1960 when it became secular. The CSN developed a close relationship with the Quebec Liberal Party and worked together to reform Québec's labor law in 1965 to extend collective bargaining to government employees. However, by the late 1960s the CSN had fallen out of favor with the provincial government as it became radicalized and threw its support behind social movements.Heron, 2012, p. 104 In 1971, the three leading Quebec unions, the CSN, the CEQ teacher's union, and the Québec Federation of Labour (FTQ) voted to form the Common Front, a syndicalist organization demanding a unified minimum wage for their 250,000 members. When negotiations failed between the Common Front and the Liberal government, the unions launched the largest general strike in Canadian history. When the strike's leaders were jailed for defying orders to return to work, the strike lost momentum and the Common Front broke apart.Heron, 2012, p. 105. The CSN first formally supported Quebec sovereignty in May 1990. It had, however, been associated with the sovereignty movement long before. In both the 1973 and 1976 provincial elections, the CSN, without formally endorsing the Parti québécois, let it be known that it considered the PQ to be most closely aligned with workers' interests. During the 1980 Quebec referendum, the CSN supported a yes vote on \\"sovereignty-association\\". Gagnon, 1994  Structure  The CSN is characterized by decentralized administration: local unions are organized into federations by sector of activity and regional councils, and are very independent from the central organization. It is also the most politically active trade union in Quebec. The Confederation currently has about 300,000 members, distributed evenly between men and women, and between the private and public sectors. Marc Laviolette was replaced as president in 2002 by Claudette Carbonneau. Louis Roy, Roger Valois, and Denise Boucher are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd vice-presidents, respectively. Lise Poulin is the secretary and Pierre Patry is the treasurer. The Montreal Central Council of the CSN endorsed Québec solidaire for the 2007 Quebec election.

AECL developed the CANDU reactor technology starting in the 1950s, and in October 2011 licensed this technology to Candu Energy (a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin). Today AECL develops peaceful applications from nuclear technology through expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology and engineering. AECL's activities range from research and development, design and engineering to specialized technology development, waste management and decommissioning. AECL partners with Canadian universities, other Canadian government and private-sector R&D; agencies (including Candu Energy), various national laboratories outside Canada, and international agencies such as the IAEA. AECL describes its goal as ensuring that \\"Canadians and the world receive energy, health, environmental and economic benefits from nuclear science and technology - with confidence that nuclear safety and security are assured\\". Until October 2011 AECL was also the vendor of CANDU technology, which it had exported worldwide. Throughout the 1960s-2000s AECL marketed and built CANDU facilities in India, South Korea, Argentina, Romania, and the People's Republic of China. It is a member of the World Nuclear Association trade group. In addition, AECL manufactures nuclear medicine radioisotopes for supply to MDS Nordion in Ottawa, Ontario, and is the world's largest supplier of molybdenum-99 for diagnostic tests, and cobalt-60 for cancer therapy. AECL is funded through a combination of federal government appropriations and commercial revenue. In 2009, AECL received $651 million in federal support. In October 2011 the federal government of Canada sold the commercial CANDU design and marketing business of AECL to Candu Energy for $15 million (including 15 years worth of royalties, the government could get back as much as $285 million). The sale entered the exclusive negotiation stage in February, a month after the other bidder, Bruce Power pulled out). Poor sales and cost overruns ($1.2 billion in the last five years) were reasons for the divestment though SNC-Lavalin expects to reverse that trend by focusing on new generation reactors. SNC-Lavalin Nuclear Inc, SNC's nuclear subsidiary is already part of Team CANDU, a group of five companies that manufacture and refurbish the CANDU reactors. The government will continue to own the Chalk River Laboratories (produces isotopes for medical imaging). The transaction puts 800 jobs at risk while improving job security for 1,200 employees. Due to safety concerns many countries are considering thorium nuclear reactors which AECL's CANDU reactors easily convert into (from uranium fuelled). Higher energy yields using thorium as the fuel (1 ton of thorium produces the same amount of energy as 200 tons of uranium) also makes it more attractive. OMERS has also shown interest in the company. History =1940s= AECL traces its heritage to the Second World War when a joint Canadian-British nuclear research laboratory, the Montreal Laboratory, was established in Montreal in 1942, under the National Research Council of Canada to develop a design for a nuclear reactor. Canadian firms had American contracts from the Manhattan Project; with Eldorado Gold Mines for mining and processing uranium ore and with by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) for a heavy water plant at Trail, British Columbia. pp97-98 In 1944, approval was given by the federal government to begin with construction of the ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor at the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories near Chalk River, Ontario, located on the Ottawa River approximately 190 km northwest of Ottawa. AECL was also involved in the development of associated technology such as the UTEC computer. On September 5, 1945 the ZEEP reactor first went critical, achieving the first \\"self- sustained nuclear reaction outside the United States.\\" ZEEP put Canada at the forefront of nuclear research in the world and was the instigator behind eventual development of the CANDU reactors, ZEEP having operated as a research reactor until the early 1970s. In 1946 the Montreal research laboratory was closed and research was consolidated at Chalk River Laboratories. On July 22, 1947 the NRX (National Research Experimental) reactor, the most powerful reactor in the world at the time, went critical and was \\"used successfully for producing radioisotopes, undertaking fuels and materials development work for CANDU reactors, and providing neutrons for physics experiments.\\" =1950s= In 1952 AECL was formed by the government with a mandate to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy. On December 12, 1952 one of the world's first major reactor accidents occurred in the NRX reactor at AECL's Chalk River Laboratories, when a combination of human and mechanical error led to a temporary loss of control over the reactor's power level. Undercooling of the fuel channels led to a partial meltdown. This caused a hydrogen-oxygen explosion inside the calandria. Several fuel bundles experienced melting and ruptured, rendering much of the core interior unusable. The reactor building was contaminated, as well as an area of the Chalk River site, and millions of gallons of radioactive water accumulated in the reactor basement. This water was pumped to a waste management area of the Laboratories and monitored. Hundreds of military personnel from Canada and the U.S. (including naval officer and later U.S. President, LT James \\"Jimmy\\" Carter) were employed in the cleanup and disposal of the reactor debris. The NRX was repaired, upgraded, and returned to service 14 months later and operated for another 40 years, finally being shut down in 1992. Throughout the 1950s the NRX was used by many researchers in the pioneering fields of neutron condensed matter physics, including Dr. Bertram Brockhouse, who shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in developing the neutron scattering techniques. The NRU opened in 1957.The Economist June 20, 2009. U.S. print edition. Page 38. \\"Canada's troubled nuclear industry: Ending a dream, or nightmare\\" On November 3, 1957 the NRU (National Research Universal Reactor) first went critical. This was a natural-uranium fuelled, heavy-water moderated and cooled research reactor (converted to high-enriched-uranium fuel in the 1960s, and finally to low-enriched-uranium fuel in the 1990s). The NRU is a world-renowned research facility, producing about 60% of the world's supply of molybdenum-99, the principle isotope used for nuclear medical diagnosis. Canada also pioneered use of cobalt-60 for medical diagnosis in 1951 and currently the NRU reactor produces the medical-use cobalt-60, while selected CANDU reactors produce industrial-use cobalt-60, comprising 85% of the world's supply. NRU was primarily a Canadian design, and a significant improvement on NRX. Other than radioisotope production, the NRU provides irradiation services for nuclear materials and fuels testing, as well as producing neutron beams for the National Research Council's Canadian Neutron Beam Laboratory. On May 24, 1958 the NRU suffered a major accident. A damaged uranium fuel rod caught fire and was torn in two as it was being removed from the core, due to inadequate cooling. The fire was extinguished, but not before releasing a sizeable quantity of radioactive combustion products that contaminated the interior of the reactor building and, to a lesser degree, an area of the surrounding laboratory site. Over 600 people were employed in the clean-up. No immediate injuries resulted from AECL's two accidents, but there were over-exposures to radiation. In the case of the NRU cleanup, this resulted in at least one documented case of latent, life-changing injury, as well as allegations that radiation monitoring and protection were inadequate (meaning that additional latent injuries would have gone unrecognized or unacknowledged). \\"Battle For Pension Ending\\" by Peggy Curran, the Montreal Gazette , April 16 , 1985 \\"Nuclear Mishap Seen First Hand\\" by Michael Farber, the Montreal Gazette , April 29 , 1986 =1960s= In 1954 AECL partnered with the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario to build Canada's first nuclear power plant at Rolphton, Ontario, which is 30 km upstream from Chalk River. On June 4, 1962 the NPD (Nuclear Power Demonstration) first reactor went critical to demonstrate the CANDU concept, generating about 20 MWe. In 1963, AECL established the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment (now Whiteshell Laboratories) in Pinawa, Manitoba where an organically moderated and cooled reactor was built. Later work on developing a SLOWPOKE reactor, thorium fuel cycle, and a proposal for safe storage of radioactive waste were carried out at this site. AECL built a larger CANDU prototype (200 MWe) at Douglas Point on Lake Huron, first going critical on November 15, 1966. Douglas Point experienced significant problems with leakage of heavy water, which were eventually solved by much-improved valve design. Other important design refinements worked out at Douglas Point opened the way for upscaling to commercial power CANDU reactors in subsequent years. =1970s= In 1971 the first commercial CANDU reactor, Pickering A 1, began commercial operation. By 1973 the other three reactors of the A group at Pickering were online and constituted the most powerful nuclear facility in the world at that time. Each Pickering unit produces about 600 MWe of power. On May 18, 1974, India detonated a nuclear bomb made from plutonium manufactured by the CIRUS research reactor built by AECL in 1956, which was a commercial version of its NRX research reactor. In addition AECL built two power reactors in India based on the Douglas Point design, and many of India's other reactors are domestic variants of this design. The connection between India's nuclear weapons program and its CIRUS research reactor led to a severance of nuclear technological cooperation between Canada and India. In 1977-1978 the Bruce A group went online and began commercial operation. Each Bruce unit produces about 800 MWe of power. In 1978, Whiteshell Labs began research into fuel waste disposal. =1980s= Between 1983 and 1986, the Pickering B group went online and also in 1983 the single CANDU reactor at Point Lepreau began operation, as did the Gentilly 2 CANDU reactor. Between 1984–1987 the Bruce B group began commercial operation, and also in 1987 the CANDU design was ranked one of Canada's top-10 engineering achievements. Douglas Point was decommissioned in May, 1984. Between 1985 and 1987, a series of design flaws in AECL's Therac-25 medical accelerator caused massive overdoses of radiation on 6 different occasions, resulting in five deaths. In 1987 the machine was found defective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and eventually recalled by AECL after multiple denials that the problems existed. =1990s= Between 1990 and 1993, the 4 CANDU reactors at Darlington went online and represent the most recent reactor construction in Canada. In 1991, AECL decided to spin off its medical isotope production business under the name Nordion International Inc. The unit was sold to MDS Health Group and now operates under the name MDS Nordion With a contract signed in 1991, AECL, in partnership with MDS Nordion, began construction of the MAPLE dedicated isotope-production facility. Constructed on-site at AECL's Chalk River Laboratories this facility would house two reactors and an isotope processing facility. Each reactor was designed to be able to produce at least 100% of the world's medical isotopes, meaning that the second reactor would be used as a back-up to ensure an uninterruptible supply. The first reactor was started but experienced malfunctions in its safety rods, and a positive nuclear power feedback coefficient was recorded. After running over the Schedule by more than 8 years and more than doubling the initial budget, Unit 1 of the Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant was commissioned on December 2, 1996. Rated at 706 MWe, it currently supplies approximately 10% of Romania's electrical needs. Unit Two achieved criticality on 6 May 2007 and was connected to the national grid on 7 August. It began operating at full capacity on 12 September 2007, also producing 706 MW. In the late 1990s, several reactors were built by AECL in South Korea. Wolsong 2 was commissioned July 1, 1997. Wolsong 3 was commissioned on July 1, 1998. Wolsong 4 was commissioned October 1, 1999. All three reactors were rated at 715MWe Gross Output. They currently have some of the highest lifetime capacity factors of nuclear reactors. =2000s= In 2001, AECL began tests at Chalk River Labs to determine the feasibility of using surplus mixed oxide fuel (MOX) from the Russian and U.S. defence programs (which contains plutonium) as a fuel in CANDU reactors. Currently, AECL is developing the Advanced CANDU Reactor, or \\"ACR\\". This design is meant to improve the commercial CANDU 6 design in terms of capital cost and construction schedule, while maintaining the classic design and safety characteristics of the CANDU concept. Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 began operation on May 6, 2007. Preparatory work required for the completion of Units 3 and 4 is scheduled to begin by the end of 2007. Company president Robert Van Adel has announced that he will be stepping down from the position of president and retire from the company effective November 11, 2007.Nuclear Engineering International Energy Alberta Corporation announced August 27, 2007 that they had filed application for a license to build a new nuclear plant at Lac Cardinal (30 km west of the town of Peace River. The application would see an initial twin AECL Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) plant go online in 2017, producing 2.2 gigawatt (electric).Lac Cardinal plant (Alberta Index) Lac Cardinal plant (CBC) Point Lepreau, New Brunswick CANDU 6 plant refurbishment to begin as of April 1, 2008. In June 2008, the Province of Ontario has announced plans to build two additional commercial reactors for electricity generation at a site next to Ontario Power Generation's Darlington Nuclear Generating StationThe Toronto Star (Jun 17, 2008) Two companies, AREVA and Westinghouse Electric Company along with AECL submitted proposals to build the reactors. In June 2009 the province announced that only AECL's ACR-1000 submission met all the proposal requirements. The Ontario government has since suspended the acquisition process citing the cost and uncertainty surrounding the companies future ownership (discussed below).The Globe and Mail(Jul. 01, 2009) Medical isotope production using the 1957-built NRU reactor experienced two forced outages due to safety concerns (December 2007) The Toronto Star (Dec 07, 2007)AECL Press Release (December 04, 2007) and a heavy water leak (May 14, 2009).AECL Press Release (May 15, 2009) The production from the NRU reactor represents a significant fraction of the worlds medical isotope supply and the disruptions has caused a worldwide shortage. Due to maintenance requirements from the aging NRU reactor and the failure of the MAPLE 1 & 2 reactor projects, the long term production of medical isotopes at Chalk River has become uncertain. The NRU reactor at Chalk River will be decommissioned in 2018. =2011 Divestiture CANDU Design Division= In the summer of 2011 SNC- Lavalin won an international bidding process for the reactor design division of the company. Prior to the acquisition, 10% of SNC Lavalin's international power workforce (400 of 4000) were engaged in the production and refurbishment of nuclear reactors. Concerns raised about the deal include a lack of commitment by SNC-Lavalin to keeping the design division intact (its size makes it more capable of providing ongoing safety support). For 2010 and 2009 combined Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd lost $493 million. Following divestiture of the reactor design division, AECL will consist of the current Nuclear Laboratories division, including the Chalk River laboratory (produces isotopes for medical imaging), and will continue to be a Crown Corporation on paper but will privatise the operation of its facilities.

He served as Mayor of San Francisco from 1897 to 1902 and represented California in the United States Senate from 1915 to 1921. Phelan was also active in the movement to restrict Japanese and Chinese immigration to the United States. Early years Phelan was born in San Francisco, the son of James Phelan and Alice Kelly. James Phelan (1819–1892) was an Irish immigrant who became wealthy during the California Gold Rush as a trader, merchant, banker and real estate investor.Clark, S. B. F. (1929). How many miles from St. Jo?: The log of Sterling B. F. Clark, a forty-niner, with comments. San Francisco: Priv. print (includes a brief autobiography of James Phelan) online at HathiTrust James D. Phelan graduated from St. Ignatius College in 1881. He had two sisters, Alice Phelan Sullivan and Mary Louis Phelan.Legacy of a Native Son: James Duval Phelan & Villa Montalvo, pg. 10, (1993), by James P. Walsh and Timothy J. O'Keefe; \\"Creating the Fortune, Creating the Family,\\" Journal of the West, (Spring, 1992) by James P. Walsh Career Phelan studied law at the University of California, Berkeley and then became a banker. He was elected Mayor of San Francisco and served from 1897 until 1902. He pushed for the reform City Charter of 1898 in San Francisco. He served as the first president of the League of California Cities, which was created in 1898. During this time, Phelan established himself as a leader in what fellow anti-Japanese agitator V. S. McClatchy described as the \\"holy cause\\" of Japanese exclusion.Daniels, Roger. The Politics of Prejudice: The Anti-Japanese Movement in California and the Struggle for Japanese Exclusion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), p 91. He remained active in the anti-Japanese movement after leaving office, securing then-presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson's support for restricting Japanese immigration in 1912 and helping to push through California's discriminatory alien land law in 1913. Phelan was also an advocate for excluding Chinese from the United States. In fact, in a debate with Imperial Chinese Consul Ho Yow, Phelan mentioned that the Chinese were an undesirable population because they had strong ties to their native country and were incapable of assimilating to the American society. This debate occurred just nineteen months after the outbreak of plague in San Francisco's Chinatown. Phelan mentioned that the Chinese had different mindsets and that after twenty years, they remained unchanged in their values. He concluded that American progress would be stunted if the United States continued to allow Chinese immigrants to remain in the country, and that the Chinese workers were taking work away from white workers. Water and land rights In the 1900s, Phelan bought land and water acreage in various places around the San Francisco Bay Area, and he obtained the rights to the water flow of the Tuolumne River in Hetch Hetchy Valley. Ethan A. Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior under President Theodore Roosevelt, tried to stop Phelan, but Roosevelt decided that the wild area could be used for \\"the permanent material development of the region.\\"Brechin, Gray. WRCA News, October 2000, Volume 7, Number 3. Populist Rhetoric, Private Gain . Retrieved on July 2, 2009. Phelan's plans for the region included publicly funded water and electricity for a geographical entity he called \\"Greater San Francisco.\\" With his Bohemian Club fellows, Phelan sought to annex land at the perimeter of San Francisco Bay. San Francisco Plague Phelan during his term as Mayor In 1900, San Francisco citizens distrusted government for previous waste of taxpayers' money as well as previous refusal to enhance community resources. Government officials refused to invest in public health because health was seen as a personal concern or even a commodity. For this reason, citizens had a lot of hope in Mayor Phelan, who had previously declared the need for healthier living conditions as well as the need for \\"health departments to provide salutary environments.\\" During his tenure as the Mayor of San Francisco, Phelan and his administration were faced with dealing with the plague of 1900–1904 that infected the city's Chinatown community. Prior to the plague outbreak in Chinatown, Phelan was an active advocate for improving public health in San Francisco. On October 25, 1897, Phelan addressed the California health board in San Francisco and stated that government intervention was needed in order to establish healthier living conditions. He argued that public health departments required more funding to help improve living conditions. Furthermore, in 1899, Phelan continued his strong advocacy for public health and the prevention of disease through city measures. Later that year, in a shocking move, he opted instead to support an $18-million-dollar bond to create a new hospital, schools, and city parks. On September 1899, Phelan and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors further defunded the cities health department. The San Francisco health department was only allocated $155,960 with two-thirds of that going towards the operation of municipal hospital. Shortly after, the health board members were released from their duties due to political in-house fighting and excessive patronage. After being sworn in, Phelan's new health department board members discovered that the department was broke and that within the first six months of fiscal year 1899-1900 the department had already spent the majority of its budget. Through the defunding and mishandling of the department, Phelan and his administration left the health department and the city ill-prepared for what was looming around the corner. On June 1900 San Francisco's city hall received the news that Joseph J. Kinyoun had instituted a travel ban in hopes of preventing the spread of the plague to the rest of the country. Mayor Phelan confirmed the news by stating that Kinyoun had notified him personally about the travel ban. Phelan went on to blame the federal court ruling that restricted the ability of the local government to deal with the plague. In order to improve sanitary living conditions in Chinatown, Governor Gage proposed to hire inspectors and workers to eradicate the plague. Governor Henry Gage requested for Mayor Phelan and his administration to match the states $25,000 contribution. However, Phelan informed Governor Gage that the city did not have the resources to match the states contribution. After meeting with Governor Gage, Phelan and his Board of Supervisors agreed to contribute $6,000. On the summer of 1901, Mayor Phelan publicly announced that he would not run for another term. \\"During his final address before leaving office, Phelan praised the health board, claiming that because of its vigilance the city 'was saved from Oriental infection.'\\" Phelan concluded by thanking the federal government and their efforts to help the city endure the crisis. Although the San Francisco Plague in Chinatown was reported in journalism, the material printed was prone to exaggerations, biased information, and focused on making the Chinese population look substandard. Newspapers were heavily averse to the Democratic Phelan administration and believed the health officials were corrupt and wasteful. For this reason, publications refused to print public health initiatives to prevent disease outbreaks and instead would focus on the community's lack of sanitation. Acts of racism were apparent because publications were heavily inclined to use offensive images and headlines to attract attention of readers. Earthquake recovery efforts During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake Phelan was a member of the Committee of Fifty, called into existence by Mayor Schmitz to manage the crisis. Afterward, when Dr. Edward Thomas Devine, representing the American Red Cross by appointment of President Roosevelt, was responsible for Relief and Red Cross Funds, ex-Mayor Phelan was allowed to assist Devine, thus keeping the money out of the hands of Schmitz and Abe Ruef. Phelan became Chairman of the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Relief and Red Cross Funds when Devine was relieved of his post in July 1906. U.S. Senate A 1920 reelection campaign pamphlet touting Phelan's white supremacy As a Democrat, Phelan ran for the U.S. Senate against Republican Joseph R. Knowland and Progressive Francis J. Heney. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1914 and served from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1921. Although he had toned down his anti-Japanese rhetoric during World War I, when the United States had allied with Japan, in 1919, Phelan once again began to speak out against the \\"Yellow Peril,\\" delivering a speech in favor of Japanese exclusion before a special session of the state legislature. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1920, defeated by Republican Samuel M. Shortridge, coming in second with 40% of the vote. His defeat may have been the result of his racially tinged campaign; one of his reelection campaign posters contained the headline \\"Keep California White.\\" (This poster is displayed at the Japanese American National Museum). During his time in the Senate, he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Railroads during the 64th Congress and of the U.S. Senate Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands during the 65th Congress. Later life After his time in the Senate, Phelan returned to banking and collected art. He remained active in the anti-Japanese movement, collaborating with McClatchy and the Japanese Exclusion League of California to successfully ban Japanese immigrants from entering the country with the Immigration Act of 1924. He died at his country estate Villa Montalvo in Saratoga in 1930. He is buried in the family mausoleum in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

(1939) The Structure and Growth of Residential Neighborhoods in American Cities Washington, Federal Housing Administration It is a modification of the concentric zone model of city development. The benefits of the application of this model include the fact it allows for an outward progression of growth. As with all simple models of such complex phenomena, its validity is limited.Smith, P.J. (1962) \\"Calgary: A study in urban pattern\\", Economic Geography, 38(4), pp.315-329 Application  This model applies to numerous British cities. Also, if it is turned 90 degrees counter- clockwise it fits the city of Mönchengladbach reasonably accurately. This may be because of the age of the cities when transportation was a key, as a general rule older cities follow the Hoyts model and more recent cities follow the Burgess (concentric zone) model. Limitations  The theory is based on early twentieth-century rail transport and does not make allowances for private cars that enable commuting from cheaper land outside city boundaries.Rodwin, L. (1950) \\"The Theory of Residential Growth and Structure\\", Appraisal Journal, 18, pp.295-317 This occurred in Calgary in the 1930s when many near-slums were established outside the city but close to the termini of the street car lines. These are now incorporated into the city boundary but are pockets of low cost housing in medium cost areas. The theory also does not take into account the new concepts of edge cities and boomburbs, which began to emerge in the 1980s, after the creation of the model.

It bridges the River Cam about one hundred feet northwest of Silver Street Bridge and connects two parts of Queens' College. Its official name is simply the Wooden Bridge. It is a Grade II listed building. The bridge was designed by William Etheridge, and built by James Essex in 1749. It has been rebuilt on two occasions, in 1866 and in 1905, but has kept the same overall design. Although it appears to be an arch, it is composed entirely of straight timbers built to an unusually sophisticated engineering design, hence the name. A replica of the bridge was built in 1923 near the Iffley Lock in Oxford. The original \\"mathematical bridge\\" was another bridge of the same design, also commissioned by James Essex, crossing the Cam between Trinity and Trinity Hall colleges, where Garret Hostel Bridge now stands. Mathematical explanation The tangential members of the tangent and radial trussing are highlighted. The arrangement of timbers is a series of tangents that describe the arc of the bridge, with radial members to tie the tangents together and triangulate the structure, making it rigid and self-supporting. This type of structure, technically tangent and radial trussing, is an efficient structural use of timber, and was also used for the timber supporting arches (centring) used for building stone bridges. Analysis of the design shows that the tangent members are almost entirely under compression, while the radial timbers are almost entirely subject to tension with very little bending stress, or to put it another way, the tangent and radial elements elegantly express the forces involved in arched construction.  Myths  The Mathematical Bridge (approx. 1865) pictured shortly before it was partially rebuilt in 1866.A popular fable is that the bridge was designed and built by Sir Isaac Newton without the use of nuts or bolts. Various stories relate how at some point in the past either students or fellows of the University attempted to take the bridge apart and put it back together, but were unable to work out how to hold the structure together, and were obliged to resort to adding nuts and bolts. In reality, bolts or the equivalent are an inherent part of the design. When it was first built, iron spikes were driven into the joints from the outer side, where they could not be seen from the inside of the parapets, explaining why bolts were thought to be an addition to the original. Newton could not have been directly involved since he died in 1727, twenty-two years before the bridge was constructed.

It had an output of 42 million tonnes of crude steel in 2015, making it the world's fourth-largest steelmaker by this measure. In 2010, it was the world's largest steel manufacturing company by market value. Also, in 2012, it was named as the 146th world's largest corporations by the Fortune Global 500. POSCO currently operates two integrated steel mills in South Korea, in Pohang and Gwangyang. In addition, POSCO operates a joint venture with U.S. Steel, USS-POSCO, which is located in Pittsburg, California, United States. History =1968–1971= In the 1960s, South Korean administration concluded that self-sufficiency in steel and the construction of an integrated steelworks were essential to economic development. Since South Korea had not possessed a modern steel plant prior to 1968, many foreign and domestic businesses were skeptical of Republic of Korea Government's decision to invest so heavily in developing its own industry, Despite the skepticism, under the lead of Park Tae-joon (1927-Dec 2011), then Korea Tungsten Company president, POSCO was established as a joint venture between the Government of the RoK and the Korea Tungsten Company (predecessor of TaeguTec). It began production in 1972, just four years after the company's inauguration in April 1968 with thirty-nine employees. Japan provided the money for the construction of the initial plant, following an agreement made at the Third South Korea-Japan Ministerial Meeting in 1969. Financing included US$119million in government grants and loans, US$54 million in credit from the Export-Import Bank of Japan, and technical assistance from Nippon Steel and other corporations. This cooperation was one consequence of the normalization of relations with Japan in 1965 and reflected the view of the government of Japan as noted in the Nixon-Sato communique of November 21, 1969, that \\"the national security of the Republic of Korea is essential to the security of Japan.\\" =1972–1992= POSCO first began to sell plate products in 1972 and focused its sales policies on the domestic market to improve steel self- sufficiency at home. It made special efforts to supply quality iron and steel to related domestic companies at below export price to strengthen their international competitiveness. POSCO produced 6.2 million tons of raw steel in 1980, recording a 13% increase over the previous year, and was one of the few exceptions when almost all areas of the Korean economy were in economic depression. Domestic industries absorbed POSCO's major products such as automobile and home appliance manufacturers consuming hot rolled products, shipbuilding and construction and engineering companies consuming medium plates, and electric motor and transformer manufacturers consuming electrical sheets. Some over-produced products were exported to foreign countries but the significant import of sections for construction left Korea as a net importer. Globally, POSCO was already the most efficient steel producer in certain products. By the late 1980s POSCO's growth had been immense. It was the fifth biggest steel company in the world, with an annual production approaching 12 million tons worth 3 trillion won. POSCO continued to expand productivity and size at a time when the steel industries of the United States and Japan were declining. POSCO completed its second-phase mill at Gwangyang in August 1988. A third-phase mill completed in 1992 further increased crude steel production to a total output of approximately 17.2 million tons a year. In terms of productivity, POSCO was the world's best steel manufacturer throughout the late 1980s and also was at the top in terms of facilities. Pohang, previously a fishing port whose major industry was processing fish and marine products, became a major industrial center with almost 520,000 people. In addition to the huge integrated steel mill, Pohang became an industrial complex housing companies that manufacture finished steel products of raw materials provided. Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) POSCO CEO Park Tae-joon was quoted as saying, \\"You can import coal and machines, but you cannot import talent\\". Park realized the need for Korea to educate their youth in science and technology to ensure Korea's position in the high technology arena. Park founded the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in 1986 as Korea's first science and technology research-oriented university with the mission to educate young Koreans who can contribute to national prosperity through the advancement in science and technology. In 2012 and 2013, the Times Higher Education ranked POSTECH 1st in their \\"100 Under 50 Young Universities\\" rankings. =1992–1997= Changes in managerial systems and organizational structure accelerated in 1993 when POSCO's president and founder, Park Tae-Joon, who had wielded absolute managerial authority for more than 25 years, resigned. With the change in leadership—from Park Tae-Joon to Ryu-Sang Bu, POSCO increased decentralization and diversification. POSCO's management emphasized greater flexibility, autonomy, and consensual decision- making processes. The chairman also moved to devolve more autonomy to the profit centres and changing from a strictly hierarchical organizational structure to one based on teams. In July 1994, POSCO created two subsidiary companies, POSTEEL and POSTRADE. POSTEEL is the domestic sales and service arm of the company, while POSTRADE handles international trading of POSCO products. Both subsidiaries commenced full operation in September 1994, with all international POSCO affiliates transferred to POSTRADE by the end of that year. The landmark Posteel Tower on Tehran Street, in Seoul's Gangnam district (not to be confused with the POSCO Center, also on Tehran Street) was completed in 2003. =1997–2000= In 1997, Seoul announced that it was going to transform POSCO into a private company in line with the government's new policy of privatizing state-owned enterprises. The government planned to retain a majority share of the stock; initial reports in the South Korean press in 1998 indicated that the sale of public shares was going slower than anticipated. However, the administration led by Kim Young Sam changed the initial policy direction of privatization of POSCO and decided not to sell government-owned stock to keep it as a government investment enterprise. But, the Kim Dae Jung administration following the Kim Young Sam administration listed privatization of public enterprise as a high priority policy in economic policy agenda to implement mainly because of outbreak of the economic crisis. The new administration decided to privatize POSCO and by 1998, the South Korean government had reduced its ownership of shares in POSCO to less than 20%, and more than 58% of the shares in POSCO were in the hands of foreign investorshttp://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2018/06/693_250844.html. In 2000, full privatization of POSCO was completed. =2001–present= As part of the privatization process, new Chairman Lee Ku-Taek began efforts to introduce a professional management and governance system of global standards for POSCO. Under the new governance system, management made accountability to shareholders a priority. POSCO also introduced a new performance-based evaluation and compensation system. Throughout most of its privatization drive, POSCO increased its revenue and business profit. Thanks to robust demand at home and in China, POSCO recorded the largest profits in the global steel industry in 2004. Net earnings from POSCO's array of steel products – used in everything from screws to skyscrapers – shot up 80% to $1.66 billion in 2004 from the previous year. With increasing global competition, POSCO looked to China and India for new opportunities. South Korean wages were too high to support a whole range of activities and POSCO looked elsewhere for new projects while keeping the areas where they have a comparative advantage in South Korea. By 2006, POSCO had 26 subsidiaries and invested over $2.4 billion in fresh investment on mainland China, especially in galvanized and stainless steel to supply global auto and appliance makers that have opened plants there. In 2006, POSCO started operating the Zhangjiagang Pohang Stainless Steel (ZPSS) steel mill capable of producing 600,000 tons of stainless steel and hot-rolled products annually in China's Jiangsu Province. As a result, POSCO became the first foreign firm operating an integrated stainless steel mill in China, handling the entire production process from smelting iron ore to finished products, including the cold rolled stainless plant it already operates. POSCO in India In June 2005, POSCO signed a memorandum of understanding with the State of Odisha in India. Under the agreement, POSCO plans to invest US$12 billion to construct a plant with four blast furnaces, an electricity plant, housing, and an annual production capacity of 12 million tons of steel, which is slated to start production in 2010. The project, which would start with a 3 million tonne capacity initially, would fetch revenue for the government to the tune of Rs 700 crore to Rs 800 crore (Rs 7-8 billion) annually. It would also provide direct employment to 13,000 people and ensure indirect employment for another 35,000. The Odisha state government also promised to provide a total of 600 million tons of iron sources, and will allow POSCO to use iron ore from these sources over the next 30 years. If the project goes ahead, it will be the single largest foreign direct investment in India as well as being the world's biggest greenfield steel plant ever. However, from 2005 till date (as of August 7, 2010), the India project has not been able to proceed due to strong opposition from the local residents in the area proposed to be given for the steel plant. There have been allegations that the federal and State governments have been illegally trying to take lands and forests for the project, in violation of the Forest Rights Act. There have also been claims that the project will only benefit the company while displacing more people than it employs, damaging the environment and taking India's mineral resources at a very low price. Further, a study undertaken by the Mining Zone Peoples' Solidarity Group, an international research group focused on India, finds evidence of irregularities in dealings with state, bureaucracy and judiciary and questions and debunks the social, economic and environmental claims that the project has made. The MoU between POSCO and State of Odisha expired in 2010. Following allegations that the ministry had not adhered to Forest Rights Act, Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) set up the N.C. Saxena committee in July 2010 to review the clearance. Despite the committee's report indicating that provisions of the Forest Rights Act had been violated, the MoEF issued final order on January 31, 2011 and gave environment clearance to POSCO. In May 2013, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) halted land acquisition for the POSCO projects. In July 2013, POSCO completed land acquisition despite the order given by NGT. In December 2013, POSCO began construction of a boundary wall around its plant site. In December 2013, the NGT criticised the forest clearance granted by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to the proposed steel plant of South Korean steel giant, POSCO, in Odisha. There have been reports that during protests and land acquisition during Feb - Mar 2013, there has been bombing attack on the resisting villages and naked protest against the police atrocity. The Centre came out confident on 15 January 2014 that with the renewal of environment clearance, South Korean steel giant Posco's project in Odisha would take off soon. After a meeting with visiting South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Yoon Sang-jick, Mr. Sharma told the media: \\"So far, 1,700 acres of land — out of 2,718 acres — have been transferred to Posco and the rest will soon be given.\\" POSCO finally exited from this project on March 18, 2017 (Saturday) POSCO in other developing countries POSCO have pursued investment opportunities in other developing countries such as Vietnam and Mexico. It was announced in August 2006 that POSCO will build a large-scale steel mill in southern Vietnam. POSCO plans to build the US$1 billion plant in two phases for hot-rolled by the end of 2012 and cold rolled products by the time of December 2009. When completed, the mill is expected to produce three-million tons of steel products annually. Posco also plans to build a $250 million plant in the city of Altamira, Mexico, to produce 400,000 tons of galvanized steel sheet a year for automakers. The venture will be Posco's first wholly owned steel-plate plant in North America. Posco began construction in early 2008, and started operations in 2009, producing galvanized and galvannealed steel. On June 30, 2006, POSCO completed the construction of its sixth continuous galvanizing line (CGL) at its Gwangyang mill in the South Jeolla Province. With this new addition, POSCO becomes the no.2 producer of sheet-steel just behind ArcelorMittal. In early 2007, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 4% stake in POSCO. In 2014 they sold their share. In February 2013 POSCO signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Afferro Mining, Inc, with a view to developing iron ore resources is Cameroon. In November 2013, the completion of steel plant construction in Cilegon, Indonesia is scheduled. It is predicted that the annual production capability of this plant will be 3 million tons of molten iron. On July 31, 2012, the moving-in ceremony of 4 large steel structured pillars surrounding integrated steel mill furnace was held. Operations =Head Office= POSCO's Headquarters, along with the POSCO Center, form the 'brain' of the company, overseeing major tasks, such as the management, planning, and finances of the steelworks at Pohang and Gwangyang. The construction of POSCO headquarters at 1 Goedong-dong, Nam-gu, Pohang, was completed on April 1, 1987. =POSCO Center= Hosts a variety of cultural programs, events, and exhibitions throughout the year. =Pohang and Gwangyang Steelworks= Posco steel mill in Pohang, Korea Pohang - Constructed in four phases between April 1970 and February 1981 along Korea's southeast coast, the nation's first integrated steelworks has produced 230 million tons of pig iron through March 2004 - enough to build some 250 million compact cars. Crude Steel Production (2008) = 13.6 million tons. Gwangyang Steelworks Gwangyang - Constructed in four phases between September 1982 and October 1992 on Korea's southern coast, the nation's second integrated steelworks. Gwangyang focus on manufacturing automotive steel, high-strength structure steel, API line pipe steel, and other strategic product categories.

It was a fashionable resort for centuries in antiquity, particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic, when it was reckoned as superior to Capri, Pompeii, and Herculaneum by the super-rich, who built luxurious villas here from 100 BC to AD 500. It was notorious for its hedonistic offerings and the attendant rumours of corruption and scandal. The lower part of the town later became submerged in the sea due to local volcanic, bradyseismic activity which raised or lowered the land, and recent underwater archaeology has revealed many of the fine buildings now protected in the submerged archaeological park.Archaeological park: Parco archeologico sommerso di Baia: Sunken Nymphaeum Many impressive buildings from the upper town can be seen in the Parco Archeologico delle Terme di Baia. Name Baiae was said to have been named after Baius (, Baîos), the helmsman of Odysseus's ship in Homer's Odyssey, who was supposedly buried nearby. The adjacent \\"\\" () was named after the town. It now forms the western part of the Gulf of Pozzuoli. The settlement was also mentioned in 178 under the name (\\"Cumaean Waters\\"). History Satellite view of area Baiae was built on the Cumaean Peninsula in the Phlegraean Fields, an active volcanic area. It was perhaps originally developed as the port for Cumae. Baiae was particularly fashionable towards the end of the Roman Republic. Marius, Lucullus, and Pompey all frequented it. Julius Caesar had a villa there, and much of the town became imperial property under Augustus. Nero had a notable villa constructed in the middle of the 1st century and Hadrian died at his villa in 138.Historia augusta, ch. 25 It was also a favourite spot of the emperor Septimius Severus. The resorts sometimes capitalised on their imperial associations: Suetonius mentions in his history that the cloak, brooch, and gold bulla given to the young Tiberius by Pompey's daughter Pompeia Magna were still on display around 120\\\\. According to Suetonius, in 39, Baiae was the location for a stunt by the eccentric emperor Caligula to answer the astrologer Thrasyllus's prediction that he had \\"no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Gulf of Baiae\\". Caligula ordered a 3-mile-long pontoon bridge to be built from impounded ships of the area, fastened together and weighted with sand, stretching from Baiae to the neighbouring port of Puteoli. Clad in a gold cloak, he then crossed it upon a horse. Cassius Dio's Roman History also includes the event, with the detail that the emperor ordered resting places and lodging rooms with potable water erected at intervals along the bridge. As late as the 18th century, scattered fragments were still being shown to tourists as the \\"Bridge of Caligula\\". Malloch has argued that Suetonius's account was likely coloured by his bias against Caligula; instead, he claims that \\"the act of bridging the Bay of Naples was an excellent—and safe—means by which to lay the foundation for [Caligula’s] military glory.\\" Baiae was notorious for the hedonistic lifestyle of its residents and guests. In 56 , the prominent socialite Clodia was condemned by the defence at the trial of Marcus Caelius Rufus as living as a harlot in Rome and at the \\"crowded resort of Baiae\\", indulging in beach parties and long drinking sessions. An elegy by Sextus Propertius written in the Augustan Age describes it as a \\"den of licentiousness and vice\\". In the 1st century, \\"Baiae and Vice\\" formed one of the moral epistles written by Seneca the Younger; he described it as a \\"vortex of luxury\\" and a \\"harbour of vice\\" where girls went to play at being girls, old women as girls and some men as girls according to a first century BC wag. It never attained municipal status, being administered throughout by nearby Cumae. From 36BC, Baiae included Portus Julius, the base of the western fleet of the Roman Navy before it was abandoned because of the silting up of Lake Lucrinus (from which a short channel led to Lake Avernus) for the two harbours at Cape Misenum 4 miles south. Baiae was sacked during the barbarian invasions and again by Muslim raiders in the 8th century. It was deserted owing to recurrent malaria by 1500, but Pedro de Toledo erected a castle, the , in the 16th century. Archaeology Temple of Mercury The site had occasionally revealed Roman sculptures. The Aphrodite of Baiae, a variant of the Venus de Medici, was supposedly excavated there sometime before 1803, when the English antiquary Thomas Hope began displaying it in his gallery on Duchess Street in London. The important archaeological remains were intensively excavated from 1941, revealing layers of buildings, villas and thermal complexes belonging to periods from the late Republican age, the Augustan, Hadrianic to the late empire. The lowering of the ground below sea level, due to bradyseism, seems to have occurred in two phases: between the third and fifth centuries, still in the late Imperial era, followed by a more substantial submersion a century later. The lower part of Baiae was largely submerged by the sea by the 8th century.Eduardo Scognamiglio, The survey of the submerged Bay: reteissa.it A cache of plaster casts of Hellenistic sculptures was discovered in the cellar of the Baths of Sosandra at Baiae; they are now displayed at the town's archaeological museum. The collection includes parts of several famous sculptures, including Athens's Harmodius and Aristogeiton and the Athena of Velletri. It suggests that the area had a workshop mass-producing marble or bronze copies of Greek art for the Italian market. Monuments Temple of Diana \\"Temple of Mercury\\" which has remarkable acoustic properties Temple of Venus Villa of the Ambulatio Among the most significant and remarkable remains are several dome-like structures such as the great so-called Temple of Mercury, the Temple of Venus, and the Temple of Diana, which were traditionally credited to some of the more famous residents of the town's villas, (although they were not temples but parts of thermal baths). =Temple of Diana= This colossal ogival dome, today half collapsed, originally collected vapours coming from the ground below and was used for thermal baths. It was decorated with marble friezes depicting hunting scenes.Mileto S. (1998) The Phlegraean Fields , Rome, Newton & Compton, p. 39 , 40 , 42 , 43 , . =Temple of Mercury= The \\"Temple of Mercury\\" consists of an enormous diameter dome, a miracle of engineering and the largest in the world prior to the construction of Rome's Pantheon in 128.. The dome has a central hole or oculus and was made with large tuff blocks. It was, and is still today, used to enclose the frigidarium or cold pool of the public baths. From eighteenth century descriptions it appeared to have had six niches of which four were semicircular. =Temple of Venus= Another octagonal building, sunken 3 metres in the ground, had eight large arched windows and a balcony inside overlooking the pool. It owes its name to Scipione Mazzella who claimed to have found the statue of the goddess there.Mazzella S. (1591) Site and antiquity of the city of Pozzuolo Sector of Sosandra =Villa of the Ambulatio= Overlooking the sea is the \\"Villa of the Ambulatio\\" with a series of six terraces connected to each other by a complex of staircases of which the last leads to the \\"sector of Mercury\\". It is named after the 'ambulatio', the long corridor with two longitudinal naves on the second terrace, intended to be a covered walk with large openings with a magnificent panorama of the gulf below. Traces of precious stucco can be seen on the brick structure of the central pillars. On the upper terrace were the residential areas, once richly decorated with several rooms dedicated to leisure. The third terrace is now transformed into a tree-lined garden. The fourth terrace was for service areas. On the fifth terrace are several rooms probably used as places to stay and rest, open to the sea and to the last terrace below that once was occupied by a garden, as today, perhaps surrounded by a colonnade. =Sector of Sosandra= Bounded by two parallel staircases is the sector or \\"Temple of Sosandra\\" from the name of the statue found in 1953 and now located in the National Museum of Naples. The complexity of this sector on four terraces does not allow its intended use to be identified but it was either a spa, a villa, a hospitalia (a sort of hotel for visitors to the nearby spa), or even a meeting place of Nero for the entertainment of sailors of the nearby Classis Misenensis, the Miseno fleet. On the highest terrace are service areas and a small balneum with rich stucco decorations on the ceiling. The next level has a large terrace open to the sea and bordered on three sides by a portico. In the garden are four parallel walls that perhaps delimited three triclinia in the open. Above the peristyle are several residential rooms, once richly finished, particularly the original precious mosaic floors representing theatrical masks inside geometric frames. Below this level there is a semicircular building surmounted by five vaulted rooms once hidden by a façade decorated with niches and columns, overall making an impressive composition. On the axis of the complex is a room perhaps used as a nymphaeum from which flowed the water that fed an existing large external circular tank. On the peristyle of the lower terrace are paintings from two successive periods: those with an Egyptian taste (characters and symbols of the cult of Isis ) from the middle of the 1st century AD; these are largely covered by paintings of the 2nd century, which depict male and female figures within architectural schemes. =Other sites= Completely submerged by the waters is the nymphaeum of Emperor Claudius whose sculptures have been transferred to the town's archaeological museum, the (Phlegraean Fields Archaeological Museum) which also contains other items excavated on the site. The public and private baths of Baiae were filled with warm mineral water directed to their pools from underground hot springs, as many still are today. Roman engineers were also able to construct a complex system of chambers that channelled underground heat into facilities that acted as saunas. In addition to their recreational function, the baths were used in Roman medicine to treat various illnesses and physicians would attend their patients at the springs.. Mosaic in the baths of Venus Baiae was supplied with fresh drinking water from a branch of the Aqua Augusta aqueduct, a cross-section of which can be seen nearby.Aqua Augusta - Serino (Italy): http://www.romanaqueducts.info/aquasite/serino2/index.html Cultural depictions * Seneca the Younger, the Roman Stoic philosopher, makes reference to this city in one of his Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium. * The lost wonders of Baiae were a common feature of Romantic poetry.

The Model The model describes the layout of a city, based on Chicago. It says that even though a city may have begun with a central business district, or CBD, other smaller CBDs develop on the outskirts of the city near the more valuable housing areas to allow shorter commutes from the outskirts of the city. This creates nodes or nuclei in other parts of the city besides the CBD thus the name multiple nuclei model. Their aim was to produce a more realistic, if more complicated, model. Their main goals in this were to: # Move away from the concentric zone model # To better reflect the complex nature of urban areas, especially those of larger size The model assumes that: #Land is not flat in all areas #Even Distribution of Resources #Even Distribution of people in Residential areas #Even Transportation CostsSwanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. Reasons for the model Harris and Ullman argued that cities do not grow around a single nucleus but several separate nuclei. Each nucleus acts like a growth point. The theory was formed based on the idea that people have greater movement due to increased car ownership. This increase of movement allows for the specialization of regional centers (e.g. heavy industry, business parks, retail areas). The model is suitable for large, expanding cities. The number of nuclei around which the city expands depends upon situational as well as historical factors. Multiple nuclei develop because: # Certain industrial activities require transportation facilities e.g. ports, railway stations, etc. to lower transportation costs. # Various combinations of activities tend to be kept apart e.g. residential areas and airports, factories and parks, etc. # Other activities are found together for their mutual advantage e.g. universities, bookstores and coffee shops, etc. # Some facilities need to be set in specific areas in a city - for example, the CBD requires convenient traffic systems, and many factories need an abundant source of resources. Effects of multiple nuclei on Industry As the multiple nuclei develop, transportation hubs such as airports are constructed which allow industries to be established with reduced transportation costs. These transportation hubs have negative externality such as noise pollution and lower land values, making land around the hub cheaper. Hotels are also constructed near airports because people who travel tend to want to stay near the source of travel. Housing develops in wedges and gets more expensive the farther it is from the CBD.

As most of the United States Numbered Highways ending with \\"1\\", it is a cross-country north-south route extending from the Gulf Coast region to the Great Lakes region. Much of the highway in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin runs parallel to or is cosigned with Interstate 39 (I-39) and much of the route in several states also parallels the Illinois Central Railroad. From LaPlace, Louisiana, Mississippi, to Memphis, Tennessee, much of that portion of US 51 runs largely parallel or is concurrent with Interstate 55 (I-55). The highway's northern terminus is between Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, where it ends with a T interchange at US 2\\\\. Its southern terminus is in Laplace, Louisiana, ending at US 61\\\\. US 51 travels in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Wisconsin. In addition to singing about US 61 on his album Highway 61 Revisited, musician Bob Dylan also commemorated US 51, covering the folk song \\"Highway 51 Blues\\", earlier recorded by both Curtis Jones and Tommy McClennan, on his eponymous album Bob Dylan. The North Mississippi Allstars also paid tribute to the highway in the title track of their album 51 Phantom. In Memphis, Tennessee, all of US 51 south of South Parkway East was renamed from Bellevue Boulevard to Elvis Presley Boulevard. Graceland sits on this highway, in the subdivision of Whitehaven. In 2004, the six states that US 51 traverses banded together as the Explore Hwy 51 Coalition to help promote this \\"All-American Road\\". The group now offers visitor information for traveling the length of the road. Route description =Louisiana= LaPlace, LA US 51 crosses the Mississippi–Louisiana border a few miles north of Kentwood and continues to parallel I-55 until just below its interchanges with Louisiana Highway 3234(LA 3234) and US 190 it joins I-55 just south of Hammond at exit 28. From Hammond, the two highways, running concurrently, cross the swamps between Ponchatoula and Laplace on viaducts to I-10, where I-55 ends. The old highway is located to the east of the interstate and is still used for local traffic. US 51 continues southwestward into Laplace where it meets its end at US 61 (Airline Highway). In the 1930s, this highway was called Jefferson Davis Highway.Times Picayune, January 26, 1930 Before the construction of I-55, US 51 was routed along what is now US 51 Business between Hammond and Ponchatoula. US 51 Business ends at the joined I-55/US 51 south of Ponchatoula. From this point southward, while US 51 is joined with I-55, the former routing of US 51 lies at ground level just to the east of I-55/US 51 and carries no designation. While the southern terminus of US 51 is in Laplace at U.S. 61, it was once co- signed with U.S. 61 into downtown New Orleans. However, it was originally slated to head toward New Orleans along the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain via the New Orleans–Hammond Highway (old LA 33), which was never completed. =Mississippi= US 51 enters Mississippi from Tennessee at Southaven and parallels Interstate 55 to the east for much of its length, except for the section between the Tennessee line and Grenada, where it parallels the highway to the west. From Memphis, US 51 passes through Senatobia, Batesville, Grenada, Winona and Canton before reaching Jackson. At the Jackson-Ridgeland line, US 51 overlaps I-55 from Exit 103 (County Line Road) to Exit 96A (Pearl Street) downtown. The split is only temporary as the highway traverses Pearl, Pascagoula and State streets and meets I-55 again at Exit 93 (Interstate 20/I-55/State Street interchange). The Natchez Trace Parkway is crossed near Clinton. The two highways run together until Exit 72 (North Crystal Springs). The highway then parallels the interstate through Hazlehurst, Brookhaven and McComb until it reaches the Louisiana border. The Mississippi section of US 51 is defined at Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3. =Tennessee= US 51 travels through Memphis and up to the Kentucky border in the Mississippi valley. It is planned to become or be bypassed by Interstate 69 through Tennessee. =Kentucky= U.S 51 enters Kentucky at Fulton, and continues north through the towns of Clinton, Bardwell and Wickliffe to the Ohio River, where it is multiplexed with U.S highways 60 and 62 over the Ohio. =Illinois= US 51 between Mounds and Cairo, during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. US 51 enters Illinois from Kentucky at the town of Cairo. The route heads northbound to a village near Cairo called Mounds, and begins to overlap I-57, following it for to Dongola, before splitting and heading north. The route remains two lanes from Dongola to just before Assumption with the exception of a section between Centralia and I-64. Past Assumption, US 51 becomes an expressway to Decatur. In Decatur, US 51 follows I-72 to bypass town. US 51 leaves I-72 after , and heads north to Bloomington–Normal as an expressway. At Bloomington–Normal, US 51 follows I-74 for a mile, then I-55 for , before following I-39 for . US 51 follows I-39, intersecting I-80 and I-88 along the way. The highway also follows US 20 south of Rockford (while still following I-39). I-39/US 51 joins I-90, making US 51 of the only toll roads in Illinois that is a U.S. Highway. US 51 exits I-39/I-90 just a mile south of the Wisconsin state line. US 51 follows Illinois Route 75 (IL 75) west to the intersection of IL 251, then turns north through South Beloit to enter Wisconsin. =Wisconsin= Northern terminus of US 51 at US 2 in Hurley, WI In the state of Wisconsin, US 51 enters from Illinois at Beloit. US 51 splits off from I-39/I-90 in South Beloit, Illinois, and continues north through Janesville and Edgerton. In Edgerton, US 51 rejoins I-39/I-90 for before splitting off towards Stoughton and McFarland. US 51 runs almost parallel to I-39/I-90 through the eastern portion of Madison, crosses the Interstate in DeForest, and finally rejoins I-39 again at Portage. US 51 runs concurrently with I-39 until I-39's terminus in Wausau and continues on as a mixture of freeway and expressway until just north of the interchange with US 8\\\\. From there through Hazelhurst, US 51 is a two-lane road with sporadic three-lane sections (which were constructed in 2008). US 51 expands to four lanes, with a central fifth turn lane from Hazelhurst to Arbor Vitae; north of Arbor Vitae it returns to two lanes and continues to its northern terminus in Hurley, where it junctions with US 2.

(The opposite transitional state from sleep into wakefulness is described as hypnopompic.) Mental phenomena that may occur during this \\"threshold consciousness\\" phase include hallucinations, lucid thought, lucid dreaming, and sleep paralysis. The latter two phenomena are themselves separate sleep conditions that are sometimes experienced during the hypnagogic state. Definitions The word hypnagogia is sometimes used in a restricted sense to refer to the onset of sleep, and contrasted with hypnopompia, Frederic Myers's term for waking up. However, hypnagogia is also regularly employed in a more general sense that covers both falling asleep and waking up. Indeed, it is not always possible in practice to assign a particular episode of any given phenomenon to one or the other, given that the same kinds of experience occur in both, and that people may drift in and out of sleep. In this article hypnagogia will be used in the broader sense, unless otherwise stated or implied. Other terms for hypnagogia, in one or both senses, that have been proposed include \\"presomnal\\" or \\"anthypnic sensations\\", \\"visions of half-sleep\\", \\"oneirogogic images\\" and \\"phantasmata\\", \\"the borderland of sleep\\", \\"praedormitium\\", \\"borderland state\\", \\"half-dream state\\", \\"pre-dream condition\\",Lachman, Gary (2002). 'Hypnagogia'. Fortean Times. \\"sleep onset dreams\\",Stickgold, R., interviewed 30 October 2000 by Norman Swan for The Health Report on Australia's Radio National (transcript). Retrieved 3 July 2008. \\"dreamlets\\", and \\"wakefulness-sleep transition\\" (WST). Threshold consciousness (commonly called \\"half-asleep\\" or \\"half-awake\\", or \\"mind awake body asleep\\") describes the same mental state of someone who is moving towards sleep or wakefulness, but has not yet completed the transition. Such transitions are usually brief, but can be extended by sleep disturbance or deliberate induction, for example during meditation. Signs and symptoms Transition to and from sleep may be attended by a wide variety of sensory experiences. These can occur in any modality, individually or combined, and range from the vague and barely perceptible to vivid hallucinations. =Sights= Among the more commonly reported, and more thoroughly researched, sensory features of hypnagogia are phosphenes which can manifest as seemingly random speckles, lines or geometrical patterns, including form constants, or as figurative (representational) images. They may be monochromatic or richly colored, still or moving, flat or three-dimensional (offering an impression of perspective). Imagery representing movement through tunnels of light is also reported. Individual images are typically fleeting and given to very rapid changes. They are said to differ from dreams proper in that hypnagogic imagery is usually static and lacking in narrative content, although others understand the state rather as a gradual transition from hypnagogia to fragmentary dreams, i.e., from simple Eigenlicht to whole imagined scenes. Descriptions of exceptionally vivid and elaborate hypnagogic visuals can be found in the work of Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys. =Tetris effect= People who have spent a long time at some repetitive activity before sleep, in particular one that is new to them, may find that it dominates their imagery as they grow drowsy, a tendency dubbed the Tetris effect. This effect has even been observed in amnesiacs who otherwise have no memory of the original activity. When the activity involves moving objects, as in the video game Tetris, the corresponding hypnagogic images tend to be perceived as moving. The Tetris effect is not confined to visual imagery, but can manifest in other modalities. For example, Robert Stickgold recounts having experienced the touch of rocks while falling asleep after mountain climbing. This can also occur to people who have travelled on a small boat in rough seas, or have been swimming through waves, shortly before going to bed, and they feel the waves as they drift to sleep, or people who have spent the day skiing who continue to \\"feel snow\\" under their feet. People who have spent considerable time jumping on a trampoline will find that they can feel the up-and-down motion before they go to sleep. Many chess players report the phenomenon of seeing the chess board and pieces during this state. New employees working stressful and demanding jobs often report feeling the experience of performing work- related tasks in this period before sleep. =Sounds= Hypnagogic hallucinations are often auditory or have an auditory component. Like the visuals, hypnagogic sounds vary in intensity from faint impressions to loud noises, like knocking and crash and bangs (exploding head syndrome). People may imagine their own name called, crumpling bags, white noise, or a doorbell ringing. Snatches of imagined speech are common. While typically nonsensical and fragmented, these speech events can occasionally strike the individual as apt comments on—or summations of—their thoughts at the time. They often contain word play, neologisms and made-up names. Hypnagogic speech may manifest as the subject's own \\"inner voice\\", or as the voices of others: familiar people or strangers. More rarely, poetry or music is heard. =Other sensations= Gustatory, olfactory and thermal sensations in hypnagogia have all been reported, as well as tactile sensations (including those kinds classed as paresthesia or formication). Sometimes there is synesthesia; many people report seeing a flash of light or some other visual image in response to a real sound. Proprioceptive effects may be noticed, with numbness and changes in perceived body size and proportions, feelings of floating or bobbing as if their bed were a boat, and out-of-body experiences. Perhaps the most common experience of this kind is the falling sensation, and associated hypnic jerk, encountered by many people, at least occasionally, while drifting off to sleep. =Cognitive and affective phenomena= Thought processes on the edge of sleep tend to differ radically from those of ordinary wakefulness. For example, something that you agreed with in a state of hypnagogia may seem completely ridiculous to you in an awake state. Hypnagogia may involve a \\"loosening of ego boundaries ... openness, sensitivity, internalization- subjectification of the physical and mental environment (empathy) and diffuse- absorbed attention.\\" Hypnagogic cognition, in comparison with that of normal, alert wakefulness, is characterized by heightened suggestibility,Ellis, Havelock (1897). 'A note on hypnagogic paramnesia'. Mind, New Series, Vol. 6:22, 283–287. illogic and a fluid association of ideas. Subjects are more receptive in the hypnagogic state to suggestion from an experimenter than at other times, and readily incorporate external stimuli into hypnagogic trains of thought and subsequent dreams. This receptivity has a physiological parallel; EEG readings show elevated responsiveness to sound around the onset of sleep. Herbert Silberer described a process he called autosymbolism, whereby hypnagogic hallucinations seem to represent, without repression or censorship, whatever one is thinking at the time, turning abstract ideas into a concrete image, which may be perceived as an apt and succinct representation thereof.Silberer, Herbert (1909). 'Bericht ueber eine Methode, gewisse symbolische Halluzinations-Erscheinungen hervorzurufen und zu beobachten'. Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische Forschungen 1:2, pp. 513–525; Eng. Transl. by Rapaport D., 'Report on a method of eliciting and observing certain symbolic hallucination phenomena', in Rapaport's Organization and pathology of thought, pp. 195–207 (Columbia Univ. Press, New York 1951.). The hypnagogic state can provide insight into a problem, the best-known example being August Kekulé’s realization that the structure of benzene was a closed ring while half-asleep in front of a fire and seeing molecules forming into snakes, one of which grabbed its tail in its mouth. Many other artists, writers, scientists and inventors – including Beethoven, Richard Wagner, Walter Scott, Salvador Dalí, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and Isaac Newton — have credited hypnagogia and related states with enhancing their creativity. A 2001 study by Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett found that, while problems can also be solved in full-blown dreams from later stages of sleep, hypnagogia was especially likely to solve problems which benefit from hallucinatory images being critically examined while still before the eyes.Barrett, Deirdre The Committee of Sleep (2001) https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812932412 A feature that hypnagogia shares with other stages of sleep is amnesia. But this is a selective forgetfulness, affecting the hippocampal memory system, which is responsible for episodic or autobiographical memory, rather than the neocortical memory system, responsible for semantic memory. It has been suggested that hypnagogia and REM sleep help in the consolidation of semantic memory,Stickgold, Robert (1998). 'Sleep: off-line memory reprocessing' Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2:12, pp. 484–92. but the evidence for this has been disputed. For example, suppression of REM sleep due to antidepressants and lesions to the brainstem has not been found to produce detrimental effects on cognition. Hypnagogic phenomena may be interpreted as visions, prophecies, premonitions, apparitions and inspiration (artistic or divine), depending on the experiencers' beliefs and those of their culture. Physiology Physiological studies have tended to concentrate on hypnagogia in the strict sense of spontaneous sleep onset experiences. Such experiences are associated especially with stage 1 of NREM sleep,Rechtschaffen, A., & Kales, A. (1968). A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects. Washington, DC: Public Health Service, U.S. Government Printing. but may also occur with pre-sleep alpha waves. Davis et al. found short flashes of dreamlike imagery at the onset of sleep to correlate with drop-offs in alpha EEG activity. Hori et al. regard sleep onset hypnagogia as a state distinct from both wakefulness and sleep with unique electrophysiological, behavioral and subjective characteristics, while Germaine et al. have demonstrated a resemblance between the EEG power spectra of spontaneously occurring hypnagogic images, on the one hand, and those of both REM sleep and relaxed wakefulness, on the other. To identify more precisely the nature of the EEG state which accompanies imagery in the transition from wakefulness to sleep, Hori et al. proposed a scheme of 9 EEG stages defined by varying proportions of alpha (stages 1–3), suppressed waves of less than 20μV (stage 4), theta ripples (stage 5), proportions of sawtooth waves (stages 6–7), and presence of spindles (stages 8–9).Hori, T., Hayashi, M., & Morikawa, T. (1993). Topographical EEG changes and hypnagogic experience. In: Ogilvie, R.D., & Harsh, J.R. (Eds.) Sleep Onset: Normal and Abnormal Processes, pp. 237–253. Germaine and Nielsen found spontaneous hypnagogic imagery to occur mainly during Hori sleep onset stages 4 (EEG flattening) and 5 (theta ripples). The \\"covert-rapid-eye-movement\\" hypothesis proposes that hidden elements of REM sleep emerge during the wakefulness-sleep transition stage. Support for this comes from Bódicz et al., who note a greater similarity between WST (wakefulness-sleep transition) EEG and REM sleep EEG than between the former and stage 2 sleep. Respiratory pattern changes have also been noted in the hypnagogic state, in addition to a lowered rate of frontalis muscle activity. =Daydreaming and waking reveries= Microsleep (short episodes of immediate sleep onset) may intrude into wakefulness at any time in the wakefulness-sleep cycle, due to sleep deprivation and other conditions,Oswald, I. (1962). Sleeping and waking: Physiology and psychology. Amsterdam: Elsevier. resulting in impaired cognition and even amnesia. In his book, Zen and the Brain, James H. Austin cites speculation that regular meditation develops a specialized skill of \\"freezing the hypnagogic process at later and later stages\\" of the onset of sleep, initially in the alpha wave stage and later in theta.Austin, James H.(1999) Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness. First MIT Press paperback edition, 1999. MIT Press. , p. 92. History Early references to hypnagogia are to be found in the writings of Aristotle, Iamblichus, Cardano, Simon Forman, and Swedenborg. Romanticism brought a renewed interest in the subjective experience of the edges of sleep.Pfotenhauer, Helmut & Schneider, Sabine (2006). Nicht völlig wachen und nicht ganz ein Traum: Die Halfschlafbilder in der Literatur. Verlag Königshausen & Neumann. . In more recent centuries, many authors have referred to the state; Edgar Allan Poe, for example, wrote of the \\"fancies\\" he experienced \\"only when I am on the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so.\\" Serious scientific inquiry began in the 19th century with Johannes Peter Müller, Jules Baillarger, and Alfred Maury, and continued into the 20th century with Leroy.Leroy, E.B. (1933). Les visions du demi-sommeil. Paris: Alcan. Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist contains an elaborate description of the hypnagogic state in Chapter XXXIV.Oliver Twist, Barnes & Noble Classics, 2003 p.296 The advent of electroencephalography (EEG) has supplemented the introspective methods of these early researchers with physiological data. The search for neural correlates for hypnagogic imagery began with Davis et al. in the 1930s, and continues with increasing sophistication. While the dominance of the behaviorist paradigm led to a decline in research, especially in the English speaking world, the later twentieth century has seen a revival, with investigations of hypnagogia and related altered states of consciousness playing an important role in the emerging multidisciplinary study of consciousness. Nevertheless, much remains to be understood about the experience and its corresponding neurology, and the topic has been somewhat neglected in comparison with sleep and dreams; hypnagogia has been described as a \\"well-trodden and yet unmapped territory\\". The word hypnagogia entered the popular psychology literature through Dr. Andreas Mavromatis in his 1983 thesis,(Brunel University) which was later published by Routledge (hardback 1987, paperback 1991) under the title \\"Hypnagogia\\" the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep and reprinted in a new paperback edition in 2010 by Thyrsos Press. while hypnagogic and hypnopompic were coined by others in the 1800s and noted by Havelock Ellis. The term hypnagogic was originally coined by Alfred MauryMaury, Louis Ferdinand Alfred (1848)'Des hallucinations hypnagogiques, ou des erreurs des sens dans l'etat intermediaire entre la veille et le sommeil'. Annales Medico-Psychologiques du système nerveux, 11, 26–40. to name the state of consciousness during the onset of sleep. Hypnopompic was coined by Frederic Myers soon afterwards to denote the onset of wakefulness. The term hypnagogia is used by Dr. Mavromatis to identify the study of the sleep-transitional consciousness states in general, and he employs hypnagogic (toward sleep) or hypnopompic (from sleep) for the purpose of identifying the specific experiences under study. Important reviews of the scientific literature have been made by Leaning, Schacter, Richardson and Mavromatis. Research Self-observation (spontaneous or systematic) was the primary tool of the early researchers. Since the late 20th century, this has been joined by questionnaire surveys and experimental studies. All three methods have their disadvantages as well as points to recommend them. Naturally, amnesia contributes to the difficulty of studying hypnagogia, as does the typically fleeting nature of hypnagogic experiences. These problems have been tackled by experimenters in a number of ways, including voluntary or induced interruptions, sleep manipulation, the use of techniques to \\"hover on the edge of sleep\\" thereby extending the duration of the hypnagogic state, and training in the art of introspection to heighten the subject's powers of observation and attention. Techniques for extending hypnagogia range from informal (e.g. the subject holds up one of their arms as they go to sleep, so as to be awakened when it falls), to the use of biofeedback devices to induce a \\"theta\\" state – produced naturally the most when we are dreaming – characterized by relaxation and theta EEG activity. Another method is to induce a state said to be subjectively similar to sleep onset in a Ganzfeld setting, a form of sensory deprivation. But the assumption of identity between the two states may be unfounded. The average EEG spectrum in Ganzfeld is more similar to that of the relaxed waking state than to that of sleep onset.Wackermann, Jiri, Pütz, Peter, Büchi, Simone, Strauch, Inge & Lehmann, Dietrich (2000). 'A comparison of Ganzfeld and hypnagogic state in terms of electrophysiological measures and subjective experience'. Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association, pp. 302–15. Wackerman et al. conclude that \\"the Ganzfeld imagery, although subjectively very similar to that at sleep onset, should not be labeled as 'hypnagogic'. Perhaps a broader category of 'hypnagoid experience' should be considered, covering true hypnagogic imagery as well as subjectively similar imagery produced in other states.\\" See also      References =Bibliography=  Further reading * *Sacks, Oliver (2012). \\"On the Threshold of Sleep\\".

It is the primary north–south route in northwestern Wisconsin, serving as a vital link between I-94 at Eau Claire, Wisconsin and the Twin Ports of Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The entire route from Eau Claire to the city limits of Superior is a four lane divided highway. The highway's northern terminus is at the Fort Frances-International Falls Bridge in International Falls, Minnesota, at the Canada–US border. Its southern terminus is in La Crosse, Wisconsin, at U.S. Highway 14. Route description =Wisconsin= U.S. Highway 53 begins at its southern terminus with a junction at U.S. 14, U.S. 61, and Wisconsin Highway 16 in downtown La Crosse. From there, U.S. 53 crosses Interstate 90 and becomes a freeway bypass of Onalaska and Holmen before proceeding north to Eau Claire as a two-lane roadway. The interchange with Interstate 94 at Eau Claire begins a freeway / expressway stretch for U.S. 53 north to the city limits of Superior. The circa-2006 freeway in Eau Claire bypasses most of the city, alleviating congestion on the original route (signed now as both Business U.S. 53 and Hastings Way). Business U.S. 53 / Hastings Way is a mix of grade-separated interchanges and at-grade intersections, and is routed through Eau Claire, passing within about of downtown Eau Claire. Other smaller towns between Eau Claire and Superior (Minong and Solon Springs) were bypassed in a similar manner. Wisconsin's first single-point urban interchange is found along the U.S. 53 bypass of Eau Claire, at its interchange with U.S. 12 in Altoona.Chris Bessert. Wisconsin Highways - Highway 53 2006, URL accessed 2006 December 31 This interchange received the 2005 Outstanding Highway Construction award from the Bureau of Project Development. U.S. 53 continues as a freeway north of Eau Claire past Chippewa Falls to Rice Lake, where it then becomes an expressway with only three grade-separated interchanges (one at 28th Avenue (CTH-V) in Haugen, one at Wisconsin Highway 70 near Spooner and one at Wisconsin Highway 13, immediately southeast of Superior). U.S. 53 has a partial grade-separated interchange with U.S. 2 in the town of Amnicon, but traffic turning from U.S. 2 westbound onto U.S. 53 southbound must take a U-turn at an at-grade crossover past the interchange. After passing through the city of Superior as a four-lane city surface street (East Second Street) for a stretch, U.S. 53 then approaches the Saint Louis Bay. U.S. 53 then runs together with Interstate 535 and crosses the bay via the John Blatnik Bridge into Minnesota. =Minnesota= US 53 enters the state at the city of Duluth on the John Blatnik Bridge over the Saint Louis Bay. US 53 runs concurrently with I-535 for as it enters Minnesota. I-535/US 53 has an interchange with I-35 in Duluth, known locally as the \\"Can of Worms\\"; it features a pair of left exits from I-35, a stoplight and lane drops over the I-35 bridge. After its junction with I-35, US 53 continues through Duluth on Piedmont Avenue and Trinity Road for . US 53 then runs concurrently with State Highway 194 (MN 194) for , from Trinity Road in Duluth to Lindahl Road in the city of Hermantown. This four- lane stretch of US 53 and MN 194 are also known as the Miller Trunk Highway in the cities of Duluth and Hermantown. From Hermantown, the route proceeds north to the city of Virginia. The portion of the route from Duluth to Virginia is a four-lane expressway. US 53 has a junction with MN 33 at the unincorporated community of Independence. Continuing northbound, US 53 has an interchange with US 169 in Virginia. Immediately north of Virginia, US 53 has an interchange with MN 169 in Wuori Township. US 53 then proceeds northwest to International Falls, where it has a junction with US 71 and MN 11\\\\. US 53 in Minnesota passes through Saint Louis and Koochiching counties. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 53 is defined as unmarked legislative routes 106, 11, and 315 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.115(37), (246), and 161.114(2). US 53 is not marked with these legislative numbers along the actual highway. Designations *A portion of US 53 in Minnesota is officially designated the Voyageurs Highway. The Voyageurs Highway is a state designation that is also applied to various other state highways in Minnesota. *The 2008 Minnesota Legislature named US 53 between Superior Street and Central Entrance in the city of Duluth as Walter F. Mondale Drive. On June 12, 2008, this section of highway (Piedmont Avenue and Trinity Road) was dedicated as Walter F. Mondale Drive in honor of the former vice president's public service. History U.S. Highway 53 was extended into Minnesota in 1934. When marked, it was paved from the Wisconsin border to its junction with U.S. 169 in Virginia, on a short segment between Britt and Idington, and from Cusson to the Canadian border. The segment from Virginia to Britt was paved during that year, and the remainder was paved in 1935. A bypass around Virginia was completed in 1964 and opened to traffic that November; State Highway 135 was extended along the previous alignment through the city. The expressway section between Duluth and Virginia was constructed by 1970, except the portion between Four Corners and Independence. A new four-lane divided highway section of U.S. 53 in Duluth was constructed in 2004. This section of the route is known locally as Piedmont Avenue. Previously, from 1934 to 2004, this same section of U.S. 53 was a narrow two-lane roadway that had proceeded up the hill to a seven-legged intersection that had included Duluth's Skyline Parkway. Locally, this now- defunct infamous intersection, had been known for 70 years by the name \\"Seven Corners\\". A new U.S. Highway 53 interchange with State Highway 169 in Wuori Township was built in 2006. A four-lane expressway from north of the city of Virginia to the south city limits of Cook was constructed beginning in 2009 as part of a long-range goal of providing a four-lane highway to Canada as part of the Falls-to-Falls Corridor. The first stage, from approximately County Road 307 to 0.25 miles south of County Road 652 (Goodell Road), was completed in 2009; the second stage was completed in the fall of 2013. =Relocation between Eveleth and Virginia= On May 5, 2010, Cliffs Natural Resources provided notice to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) that U.S. Highway 53 easement rights across the United Taconite Mine, per a 1960 agreement, would be terminated to allow for expansion of the mine. United Taconite and MnDOT negotiated an agreement to move the roadway by 2017. There were three rerouting options proposed: * West – Following State Highway 37 and Saint Louis County Road 7. * Center – Through the Auburn Pit; on the south side of the existing route of Highway 53. * East – Around and across the Rouchleau Pit; on the north side of the existing route of Highway 53. The East route was selected for the project and construction began in November 2015, with the realignment reaching completion in 2017. On September 15, the new roadway was opened, with a dedication of the bridge spanning the Rouchleau Pit. The bridge is the tallest in the state at in height. Falls-to-Falls Corridor The Falls-to-Falls Corridor (officially The Falls-to-Falls Corridor—United States Route 53 from International Falls on the Minnesota/Canada border to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin) is, by the United States federal government, a recognized trade corridor. In the 1990s, the federal government listed the corridor as a priority for development. The primary development planned is infrastructure-related, specifically, a highway improvement project designed to spur economic development in northwestern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota by upgrading U.S. Highway 53 to full expressway standards from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin to International Falls, Minnesota. Interstate Highway 535 forms the only section of the route that is part of the Interstate Highway System. =Wisconsin= With the exception of a stretch as a four-lane city surface street (East Second Street) in the city of Superior, the entire route within Wisconsin is completed to freeway or expressway standards. On the south end of the corridor, the connection to Interstate Highway 94 is a stretch through the Eau Claire-Chippewa Falls conurbation. After years of legal and political wrangling, the decision was made in the late 1990s to bypass the current route, rather than to upgrade the present highway to freeway standards. The northern half of this bypass, as far south as WIS 312 was opened to traffic in mid-2005. The southern half of the bypass, which includes a new pair of multilane bridges over the Eau Claire River, goes mostly through Altoona and includes new interchanges with WIS 312, U.S. Highway 12 and WIS 93. This project won multiple awards in 2005 and 2006. This section of the bypass was opened mid-morning on August 21, 2006. =Minnesota= Federal funding for the project in northern Minnesota was $940,000 in 2003 and nearly $600,000 in 2004. At present, with the exception of stretch within the city of Duluth (Piedmont Avenue and Trinity Road), the route is completed as expressway as far north as the north side of the city of Virginia, leaving approximately of the route as-yet incomplete. A section between Virginia and Cook was recently turned into a 4-lane highway.

It is most critical at night or in poor weather, when there is no visible horizon, since vision is the dominant sense for orientation. Auditory systems and the vestibular (inner ear) system for co-ordinating movement with balance can also create illusory nonvisual sensations, as can other sensory receptors located in the skin, muscles, tendons and joints.  Senses during flight  There are four physiologic systems that interact to allow humans to orient themselves in space. Vision is the dominant sense for orientation, but the vestibular system, proprioceptive system and auditory system also play a role. During the abnormal acceleratory environment of flight, the vestibular and proprioceptive systems do not respond truthfully. Because of inertial forces created by acceleration of the aircraft along with centrifugal force caused by turning, the net gravitoinertial force sensed primarily by the otolith organs is not aligned with gravity, leading to perceptual misjudgment of the vertical. In addition, the inner ear contains rotational accelerometers, known as the semicircular canals, which provide information to the lower brain on rotational accelerations in the pitch, roll and yaw axes. However, prolonged rotation (beyond ) results in a cessation of semicircular output, and cessation of rotation thereafter can even result in the perception of motion in the opposite direction. Under ideal visual conditions the above illusions are unlikely to be perceived, but at night or in poor weather the visual inputs are no longer capable of overriding these illusory nonvisual sensations. In many cases, illusory visual inputs such as a sloping cloud deck can also lead to misjudgments of the vertical and of speed and distance or even combine with the nonvisual ones to produce an even more powerful illusion. The result of these various visual and nonvisual illusions is spatial disorientation.Previc, F. H., & Ercoline, W. R. (2004). Spatial disorientation in aviation. Reston, VA: American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics. Various models have been developed to yield quantitative predictions of disorientation associated with known aircraft accelerations.Newman, M. C., Lawson, B. D., Rupert, A. H., & McGrath, B. J. (2011, August). The role of perceptual modeling in the understanding of spatial disorientation during flight and ground-based simulator training. In AIAA modeling and simulation technologies conference and exhibit, AIAA (Vol. 5009).  Effects of disorientation  Once an aircraft enters conditions under which the pilot cannot see a distinct visual horizon, the drift in the inner ear continues uncorrected. Errors in the perceived rate of turn about any axis can build up at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 degrees per second. If the pilot is not proficient in the use of gyroscopic flight instruments, these errors will build up to a point that control of the aircraft is lost, usually in a steep, diving turn known as a graveyard spiral. During the entire time, leading up to and well into the maneuver, the pilot remains unaware of the turning, believing that the aircraft is maintaining straight flight. One of the most famous mishaps in aviation history involving the graveyard spiral is the crash involving John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1999. The graveyard spiral usually terminates when the g-forces on the aircraft build up to and exceed the structural strength of the airframe, resulting in catastrophic failure, or when the aircraft contacts the ground. In a 1954 study (180 – Degree Turn Experiment), the University of Illinois Institute of Aviation found that 19 out of 20 non-instrument-rated subject pilots went into a graveyard spiral soon after entering simulated instrument conditions. The 20th pilot also lost control of his aircraft, but in another maneuver. The average time between onset of instrument conditions and loss of control was 178 seconds. Spatial disorientation can also affect instrument-rated pilots in certain conditions. A powerful tumbling sensation (vertigo) can be set up if the pilot moves his or her head too much during instrument flight. This is called the Coriolis illusion. Pilots are also susceptible to spatial disorientation during night flight over featureless terrain.  Spatial orientation  Spatial orientation (the inverse being spatial disorientation, aka spatial-D) is the ability to maintain body orientation and posture in relation to the surrounding environment (physical space) at rest and during motion. Humans have evolved to maintain spatial orientation on the ground. The three-dimensional environment of flight is unfamiliar to the human body, creating sensory conflicts and illusions that make spatial orientation difficult and sometimes impossible to achieve. Statistics show that between 5% and 10% of all general aviation accidents can be attributed to spatial disorientation, 90% of which are fatal. Good spatial orientation on the ground relies on the use of visual, vestibular (organs of equilibrium located in the inner ear), and proprioceptive (receptors located in the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints) sensory information. Changes in linear acceleration, angular acceleration, and gravity are detected by the vestibular system and the proprioceptive receptors, and then compared in the brain with visual information. Spatial-D and G-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) are two of the most common causes of death from human factors in military aviation. Spatial orientation in flight is difficult to achieve because numerous sensory stimuli (visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive) vary in magnitude, direction, and frequency. Any differences or discrepancies between visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory inputs result in a sensory mismatch that can produce illusions and lead to spatial disorientation. Inner ear with semicircular canals shown, likening them to the roll, pitch and yaw axis of an aircraft = The otolith organs and orientation = Two otolith organs, the saccule and utricle, are located in each ear and are set at right angles to each other. The utricle detects changes in linear acceleration in the horizontal plane, while the saccule detects gravity changes in the vertical plane. However, the inertial forces resulting from linear accelerations cannot be distinguished from the force of gravity (according to the equivalence principle of general relativity they are the same thing) therefore, gravity can also produce stimulation of the utricle and saccule. A response of this type will occur during a vertical take-off in a helicopter or following the sudden opening of a parachute after a free fall.  Non-visible horizon  Anyone in an aircraft that is making a coordinated turn, no matter how steep, will have little or no sensation of being tilted in the air unless the horizon is visible. Similarly, it is possible to gradually climb or descend without a noticeable change in pressure against the seat. In some aircraft, it is possible to execute a loop without pulling negative g-forces so that, without visual reference, the pilot could be upside down without being aware of it. This is because a gradual change in any direction of movement may not be strong enough to activate the fluid in the vestibular system, so the pilot may not realize that the aircraft is accelerating, decelerating, or banking.  In the media  * It is believed that singer Jim Reeves was suffering from spatial disorientation when his Beechcraft aircraft crashed in the Brentwood area of Nashville, Tennessee, during a violent thunderstorm on 31 July 1964, claiming the lives of both Reeves and his pianist Dean Manuel. The same was also believed of the pilots in the crashes of singers Buddy Holly (The Day the Music Died) and Patsy Cline. * This phenomenon was extensively reported in the press in 1999, after John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s plane went down during a night flight over water near Martha's Vineyard. Subsequent investigation pointed to spatial disorientation as a probable cause of the accident.

In 2018, he was elected a member in the National Academy of Sciences. In 2017, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to behavioral economics. In its Nobel prize announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated that his \\"contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision- making. His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics.\\" Personal life Thaler was born in East Orange, New Jersey to a Jewish family. His mother, Roslyn (Melnikoff, 1921–2008), was a teacher, and later a real estate agent while his father, Alan Maurice Thaler (1917–2004), was an actuary at the Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, and was born in Toronto. He grew up with two younger brothers. His great-great grandfather, Selig Thaler (1831–1903) was from Berezhany, Ukraine. He has three children from his first marriage and is now married to France Leclerc, a former marketing professor at the University of Chicago and avid photographer.  Education  Thaler graduated from Newark Academy, before going on to receive his B.A. degree in 1967 from Case Western Reserve University, and his M.A. in 1970 and Ph.D. degree in 1974 from the University of Rochester, writing his thesis on \\"The Value of Saving A Life: A Market Estimate\\" under the supervision of Sherwin Rosen.  Academic career  After completing his studies, Thaler began his career as a professor at the University of Rochester. Between 1977 and 1978, Thaler spent a year at Stanford University collaborating and researching with Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who provided him with the theoretical framework to fit many of the economic anomalies that he had identified, such as the endowment effect. From 1978 to 1995, he was a faculty member at the SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell University. After gathering some attention with a regular column in the respected Journal of Economic Perspectives (which ran between 1987 and 1990) and the publication of these columns by Princeton University Press (in 1992), Thaler was offered a position at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business in 1995, where he has taught ever since.  Writings  = Books = Thaler has written a number of books intended for a lay reader on the subject of behavioral economics, including Quasi-rational Economics and The Winner's Curse, the latter of which contains many of his Anomalies columns revised and adapted for a popular audience. One of his recurring themes is that market- based approaches are incomplete: he is quoted as saying, \\"conventional economics assumes that people are highly-rational—super-rational—and unemotional. They can calculate like a computer and have no self-control problems.\\" Thaler is coauthor, with Cass Sunstein, of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness (Yale University Press, 2008). Nudge discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. \\"People often make poor choices—and look back at them with bafflement!\\" Thaler and Sunstein write. \\"We do this because, as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.\\" Thaler and his co-author coined the term choice architect. Thaler advocates for libertarian paternalism, which describes public and private social policies that lead people to make good and better decisions through \\"nudges\\" without depriving them of the freedom to choose or significantly changing their economic incentives. An example of this can be seen in Nudge through defaults in organ donation. In the United States, citizens must opt in to donate their organs, while in Australia, citizens must opt out if they do not wish to donate. Consequently, Australia has much higher rates of organ donation than does the United States. In 2015 Thaler wrote Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics, a history of the development of behavioral economics, \\"part memoir, part attack on a breed of economist who dominated the academy—particularly, the Chicago School that dominated economic theory at the University of Chicago—for the much of the latter part of the 20th century.\\" = Other writings = Thaler gained some attention in the field of mainstream economics for publishing a regular column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives from 1987 to 1990 titled Anomalies, in which he documented individual instances of economic behavior that seemed to violate traditional microeconomic theory. In a 2008 paper, Thaler and colleagues analyzed the choices of contestants appearing in the popular TV game show Deal or No Deal and found support for behavioralists' claims of path-dependent risk attitudes. He has also studied cooperation and bargaining in the UK game shows Golden Balls and Divided. As a columnist for The New York Times News Service, Thaler has begun a series of economic solutions for some of America's financial woes, beginning with \\"Selling parts of the radio spectrum could help pare US deficit,\\" with references to Thomas Hazlett's ideas for reform of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and making television broadcast frequency available for improving wireless technology, reducing costs, and generating revenue for the US government.  Nobel Prize  Richard H. Thaler during Nobel Prize press conference in Stockholm, December 2017 Thaler was the 2017 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for \\"incorporat[ing] psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision- making. By exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes.\\" Immediately following the announcement of the 2017 prize, Professor Peter Gärdenfors, Member of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee, said in an interview that Thaler had \\"made economics more human\\". After learning that he had won the Nobel Prize, Thaler said that his most important contribution to economics \\"was the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that.\\" In a nod to the sometimes- unreasonable behavior he has studied so extensively, he also joked that he intended to spend the prize money \\"as irrationally as possible.\\" Paul Krugman, the 2008 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, tweeted \\"Yes! Behavorial econ is the best thing to happen to the field in generations, and Thaler showed the way.\\" However, Thaler's selection was not met with universal acclaim; Robert Shiller (one of the 2013 laureates) noted that some economists still view Thaler's incorporation of a psychological perspective within an economics framework as a dubious proposition. In addition, an article in The Economist simultaneously praised Thaler and his fellow behavioral colleagues while bemoaning the practical difficulties that have resulted from causing \\"economists as a whole to back away a bit from grand theorising, and to focus more on empirical work and specific policy questions.\\" In chronicling Thaler's path to Nobel laureate, John Cassidy notes that although Thaler's \\"nudge\\" theory may not overcome every shortcoming of traditional economics, it has at least grappled with them \\"in ways that have yielded important insights in areas ranging from finance to international development\\". Other honors and awards In addition to earning the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Thaler holds many other honors and awards. He is a member of the National Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Finance Association, and more.  Behavioral finance and other applications in policy  Thaler also is the founder of an asset management firm, Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, which believes that investors will capitalize on cognitive biases such as the endowment effect, loss aversion and status quo bias. Since 1999, he has been the Principal of the said firm, which he co-founded in 1993. Russell Fuller, in charge of the firm's daily operations, said Thaler has changed the economics profession in that \\"[h]e doesn't write papers that are full of math. He writes papers that are full of common sense.\\" Since 1991, Thaler has also served as the co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research Behavioral Economics Project. Thaler was also involved in the establishment of the Behavioural Insights Team, which was originally part of the British Government's Cabinet Office but is now a limited company. Thaler made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2015 movie The Big Short, which was about the credit and housing bubble collapse that led to the 2008 global financial crisis. During one of the film's expository scenes, he helped pop star Selena Gomez explain the 'hot hand fallacy,' in which people believe that whatever is happening now will continue to happen in the future.

Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family, the Sudanese system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha and Sudanese). The Sudanese kinship system is the most complicated of all kinship systems. It maintains a separate designation for almost every one of Ego's kin, based on their distance from Ego, their relation, and their gender. Ego's father is distinguished from Ego's father's brother and from Ego's mother's brother. Ego's mother is similarly distinguished from Ego's mother's sister and from Ego's father's sister. For cousins, there are eight possible terms. Usage The system is named for the peoples of South Sudan. The Sudanese kinship system also existed in ancient Latin-speaking and Anglo- Saxon cultures. It exists today among present-day Arab and Turkish\\"Turkish Kinship Terms\\", University of Manitoba cultures. It tends to co-occur with patrilineal descent, and it is often said to be common in complex and stratified cultures.\\"Nature of Kinship\\", University of Palomar =Variants= Balkan kinships such as Bulgarian, Serbian, and Bosniak follow this system for different patrilinear and matrilinear uncles but collapse mother's sister and father's sister into the same term of \\"aunt\\" and Croatian and Macedonian further collapse the offspring of the uncles into one term. On the opposite side, Chinese adds an additional dimension of relative age. Ego's older siblings are distinguished from younger, as are those of Ego's parents. One must specify whether older (e.g. Mandarin 哥哥 gēge) or younger (e.g. Mandarin 弟弟 dìdi). Similarly, a term for \\"uncle\\" or (in at least in some varieties of Chinese, including Mandarin) even \\"father's brother\\" does not exist without circumlocution; the speaker must either specify \\"father's older brother\\" (e.g. Mandarin 伯伯 bóbo) or \\"father's younger brother\\" (e.g. Mandarin 叔叔 shūshu).

In recent years, other types of consumer electronics, including game consoles and dedicated media devices, have crossed over to manage video and music content. The term \\"media center\\" also refers to specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computers. HTPC and other convergent devices integrate components of a home theater into a unit co-located with a home entertainment system. An HTPC system typically has a remote control and the software interface normally has a 10-foot (3 m) user interface design so that it can be comfortably viewed at typical television viewing distances. An HTPC can be purchased pre- configured with the required hardware and software needed to add video programming or music to the PC. Enthusiasts can also piece together a system out of discrete components as part of a software-based HTPC. Since 2007, digital media player and smart TV software has been incorporated into consumer electronics through software or hardware changes including video game consoles, Blu-ray players, networked media players, televisions, and set-top boxes. The increased availability of specialized devices, coupled with paid and free digital online content, now offer alternatives to multipurpose (and more costly) personal computers.  History  The HTPC as a concept is the product of several technology innovations including high-powered home computers, digital media, and the shift from standard-resolution CRT to high- definition monitors, projectors, and large-screen televisions. Integrating televisions and personal computers dates back to the late 1980s with tuner cards that could be added to Commodore Amiga PCs via the Video Toaster. This adaptation would allow a small video window to appear on the screen with broadcast or cable content. Apple Computer also developed the Macintosh TV in late 1993 that included a tuner card built into a Macintosh LC 520 chassis but quickly withdrew from the market with only 10,000 units shipped. In 1996 Gateway Computer unveiled the Destination computer, which included a tuner card and video card. The unit cost $4,000 and mostly integrated television viewing and computer functions on one color monitor. The Destination was called a \\"PC-TV Combo\\" but by December the term \\"Home-theater PC\\" appeared in mainstream media: \\"The home theater PC will be a combination entertainment and information appliance.\\" By 2000, DVD players had become relatively ubiquitous and consumers were seeking ways to improve the picture. The value of using a computer instead of standalone DVD player drove more usage of the PC as a home media device. In particular, the desire for progressive scanning DVD players (480p instead of 480i) with better video fidelity led some consumers to consider their computers instead of very expensive DVD players. As DVD players dropped in price, so did PCs and their related video-processing and storage capabilities. In 2000, DVD decryption software using the DeCSS algorithm allowed DVD owners to consolidate their DVD video libraries on hard drives.In a 2007 landmark ruling, a U.S. court found this practice legal in specific applications where the CSS encryption is transferred to the copy on the hard drive in spite of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Innovations such as TiVo and ReplayTV allowed viewers to store and timeshift broadcast content using specially designed computers. ReplayTV for instance ran on a VxWorks platform. Incorporating these capabilities into PCs was well within the ability of a computer hobbyist who was willing to build and program these systems. Key benefits of these DIY projects included lower cost and more features. Advancements in hardware identified another weak link: the absence of media management software to make it easy to display and control the video from a distance. Original MythTV Home Screen c. 2002 By 2002, major software developments also facilitated media management, hardware integration, and content presentation. MythTV provided a free and open source solution using Linux. The concept was to combine a digital tuner with digital video recording, program guides, and computer capabilities with a 10-foot (3 m) user interface. XBMC was another free and open software project started with re- purposing the Xbox as a home theater PC but has since been ported to Windows and Macintosh operating systems in various forms including Boxee and Plex. Mainstream commercial software packages included Microsoft's XP Media Center Edition (2002, bundled with Windows XP, and Apple's Front Row (2005) software, bundled with Mac OS X. By early 2006, commercial examples of this integration included the Mac mini which had the Apple Remote, 5.1 digital audio, and an updated Front Row interface that would play shared media. Because of these features and the Mini's small form factor, consumers began using the Mini as a Mac-based home theater PC. As digital cable and satellite became the norm, HTPC software became more dependent on external decoder boxes, and the subscription costs that came with them. For instance, MythTV is capable of capturing unencrypted HDTV streams, such as those broadcast over the air or on cable using a QAM tuner. However, most U.S. cable and satellite set-top boxes provide only encrypted HD streams for \\"non-basic\\" content, which can be decoded only by OpenCable-approved hardware or software. In September 2009, OEM restrictions were officially lifted for cableCARD devices, opening up the possibility of HTPC integration. The advent of fully digital HDTV displays helped to complete the value and ease of use of a HTPC system. Digital projectors, plasma and LCD displays often came pre-configured to accept computer video outputs including VGA, DVI and Component Video. Furthermore, both the computers and the displays could include video scalers to better conform the image to the screen format and resolutions. Likewise, computers also included HDMI ports that carry both audio and video signals to home video displays or AV receivers. The simplified integration of computer and home theater displays has allowed for fully digital content distribution over the internet. For instance, by 2007 Netflix \\"watch instantly\\" subscribers could view streaming content using their HTPCs with a browser or with plug-ins with applications such as Plex and XBMC. Similar plug-ins are also available for Hulu, YouTube, and broadcasters such as NBC, CBS and PBS.  HTPC characteristics  Antec Fusion V2 home theater PC case with VFD display, 5.25\\" drive bay, volume control and some ports on front and keyboard on top. The media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet. Beyond functioning as a standard PC, normally HTPCs have some additional characteristics: = Television connectivity = Standard PC units are usually connected to a CRT or LCD display, while HTPCs are designed to be connected to a television. All HTPCs should feature a TV-out option, using either an HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, Component video, VGA (for some LCD televisions), S-Video, or composite video output. = Remote control = The Plex smartphone application used to control playback on a computerIntegrating a HTPC into a typical living room requires a way of controlling it from a distance. Many TV tuner/capture cards include remote controls for use with the applications included with the card. Software such as Boxee, GB-PVR, SageTV, MediaPortal and Beyond TV support the use of Windows MCE and other remote controls. Another option is an in-air mouse pointer such as the Wii Remote, GlideTV Navigator, or Loop Pointer, which gives cursor control from a distance. It is also possible to use common wireless keyboards and other peripherals to achieve the same effect (though the range may not be as long as a typical remote control's). Some HTPCs, such as the Plex/Mac Mini combination, support programmable remote controls designed for a wide range of typical home theater devices. More recent innovations include remote-control applications for Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets. = External and networked storage devices = Because of the nature of the HTPC, units require higher-than-average capacities for storage of pictures, music, television shows, videos, and other multimedia. Designed almost as a 'permanent storage' device, space can quickly run out on these devices. Because of restrictions on internal space for hard disk drives and a desire for low noise levels, many HTPC units use a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, or another type of network-connected file server. = TV tuner cards = A TV tuner card is a computer component that allows television signals to be received by a computer. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk. Several manufacturers build combined TV tuner plus capture cards for PCs. Many such cards offer hardware MPEG encoding to reduce the computing requirements. Some cards are designed for analog TV signals such as standard definition cable or off the air television, while others are designed for high-definition digital TV. = Network TV tuner = A network TV tuner or TV gateway is a TV server that converts TV signal from satellite, cable or antenna to IP. With multiple TV tuners, the TV gateway can stream multiple TV channels to devices across the network. Several TV gateway manufacturers build the device to stream the entire DVB stream, relying on the host player device to process the feed and to capture/record, while other devices such as VBox Home TV Gateway provide a variety of option from full PVR and live TV features, to streaming of specific DVB layers to support less powerful devices and to save network bandwidth. = Quiet/minimal noise = A common user complaint with using standard PCs as HTPC units is background noise, especially in quieter film scenes. Most personal computers are designed for maximum performance, while the functions of a HTPC system may not be processor-intensive. Thus, passive cooling systems, low-noise fans, vibration- absorbing elastic mounts for fans and hard drives, and other noise-minimizing devices are used in place of conventional cooling systems.  Software  HTPC options exist for each of the major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The software is sometimes called \\"Media Center Software\\". = Linux, Unix, and BSD = A number of media center software solutions exist for Linux-, Unix-, and BSD-based operating systems; for example MythTV is a fully fledged integrated suite of software which incorporates TV recording, video library, video game library, image/picture gallery, information portal and music collection playback among other capabilities. Kodi is also available (as it is for many platforms), and can be used to present all the available media including TV programmes recorded by MythTV. Freevo, VDR, SageTV and Boxee are other solutions. Linux, partially due to its opensource nature, is available as customised versions including the mediacentre pre-installed and with superfluous software removed. Examples include MythBuntu (based on Xubuntu), and Ubuntu TV or Kodibuntu/XBMCbuntu, (all based on Ubuntu). LinuxMCE is a complete home automation solution including lighting/curtains, security, and MythTV capability. = Mac OS X = For Mac OS X versions before 10.7 (Lion), HTPC functionality is built into the operating system itself. Specifically, the programs Front Row and Cover Flow, used in conjunction with the Apple Remote, allow users easily to browse and view any multimedia content stored on their Macs. With the July 2011 release of Mac OS X Lion, Front Row has been discontinued. Several third-party applications provide HTPC support, including Plex, and XBMC. Beyond the operating system itself, add-on hardware-plus- software combinations (for adding more full-featured HTPC abilities to any Mac) include Elgato's EyeTV series PVRs, AMD's \\"ATI Wonder\\" external USB 2.0 TV-tuners, and various individual devices from third-party manufacturers. = Microsoft Windows = For Microsoft Windows, a common approach was to install a version that contains the Windows Media Center (Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate for Windows 7 or Home Premium or Ultimate for Windows Vista). Windows Media Center included additional software that covered the PVR functions of the proposed HTPC, including free program guide information and automatic program recording. Windows 7, Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows Vista Ultimate included an MPEG2 decoder. With the introduction of Windows 8, Media Center was no longer included with the operating system; instead it was necessary to buy Windows 8 Pro and then purchase the Media Center Pack via the Windows Control Panel. Windows Media Centre is not available at all for Windows 10. However, it may be restored by a number of unofficial ways. Alternative HTPC software may be built with the addition of a third party software PVR to a Windows PC. SageTV, GB-PVR, and DVBViewer have integrated placeshifting comparable to the Slingbox, allowing client PCs and the Hauppauge MediaMVP to be connected to the server over the network. Snapstream provides heuristic commercial detection and program recompression. When using a faster CPU, SageTV and Beyond TV can record content from TV capture cards which do not include hardware MPEG2 compression. For a free alternative, GB- PVR and MediaPortal provide full home theater support and good multi-card DVR capabilities. GB-PVR also has a free client, free mediaMVP client, and free network media playback. MediaPortal provides a full client/server set-up with live TV/DVR (recorded or timeshifted) streaming. MediaPortal is open-source and offers a variety of skins and plugins for music vieos, Netflix, Pandora and others.  Digital media receivers and consumer electronics integration  Although digital media players are often built using similar components to personal computers, they are often smaller, quieter and less costly than the full-featured computers adapted to multi-media entertainment. The Roku XD/S player supports streaming internet media and local media through a USB port or home media servers such as PlexNetflix has integrated its streaming player in many consumer electronics devices including the Xbox 360In recent years, convergence devices for home entertainment including gaming systems, DVRs, Blu-Ray players and dedicated devices such as the Roku have also started managing local video, music, and/or streaming internet content. Likewise, some managed video services such as Verizon's FiOS allow users to incorporate their photographs, video, and music from their personal computers to their FiOS set- top-box including DVRs. Gaming systems such as the Nintendo Wii, Sony PlayStation 3 and the Microsoft Xbox 360 support media management beyond their original gaming orientation. As computing power increases and costs fall, traditional media devices such as televisions have been given network capabilities. So-called Smart TVs from Sony, Samsung, and LG (to name a few) have models that allow owners to include some free or subscription media content available on the Internet. The rapid growth in the availability of online content, including music, video and games, has also made it easier for consumers to use these networked devices. YouTube, for instance, is a common plug-in available on most networked devices. Netflix has also struck deals with many consumer electronics makers to have their interface available for their streaming subscribers. This symbiotic relationship between Netflix and consumer electronics makers has helped propel Netflix to become the largest subscription video service in the U.S., using up to 20% of U.S. bandwidth at peak times. Other digital media retailers such as Apple, Amazon.com and Blockbuster have purchase and rental options for video and music on demand. Apple in particular has developed a tightly integrated device and content management ecosystem with their iTunes Store, personal computers, iOS devices, and the AppleTV digital media receiver. The most recent version of the AppleTV, at $99, has lost the hard drive included in its predecessor and fully depends either on streaming internet content, or another computer on the home network for media.  Impact on traditional television services  The convergence of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television in competition with traditional service providers (cable TV and satellite television). The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or telco video service by 2015 using over-the-top services. This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list of options for watching movies and TV over the Internet grows every day. Research also shows that even as traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, adding broadband Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies, although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video streaming. Convergent devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role in the future of broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.

US 56's western terminus is at Interstate 25 Business (I-25 Bus.), US 412 and New Mexico State Road 21 (NM 21) in Springer, New Mexico and the highway's eastern terminus is at US 71 in Kansas City, Missouri. Much of it follows the Santa Fe Trail. Route description The highway passes through New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. The eastbound shoulder also touches a corner of Texas at a small road junction near the New Mexico/Oklahoma border. =New Mexico= US 56 runs concurrent with US 412 for its entire length in New Mexico, and are signed as such through the state. The two routes begin in Springer and head east towards Abbot, where they serve as the northern terminus of State Road 39. Continuing east, US 56/412 meet the southern terminus of NM 193 south of Farley, the northern terminus of NM 120 east of Gladstone, and the southern terminus of NM 453. US 56/412 intersect US 64 and US 87 in Clayton, New Mexico, and US 64 joins with US 56/412 in their trek northeast. The three routes serve as the southern terminus of NM 406 as they enter the Kiowa National Grassland. The three routes then cross into Oklahoma together. =Oklahoma= US-56's short path through Oklahoma consists of a diagonal slice across the western part of the Oklahoma Panhandle. US-56/64/412 enter Oklahoma near the southwest corner of the Panhandle, where they also enter Rita Blanca National Grassland. They leave the grassland near Felt. Three miles (4.8 km) southwest of Boise City, US-385 joins the concurrency. The routes then enter Boise City, where they enter a traffic circle around the Cimarron County Courthouse that involves US-56, US-64, US-385, US-412, State Highway 3, and SH-325. After leaving the traffic circle, US-56 overlaps US-64, US-412, and SH-3. east of the courthouse, US-56 meets US-287 at an interchange. US-56/64/412/SH-3 continue northeast for , where US-56 splits to travel northeast on its own. The route parallels the Cimarron Valley Railroad for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma. Keyes is the next town on US-56, and it also serves as the northern terminus of SH-171 where the two highways intersect. US-56 crosses into Texas County east of Sturgis. Just before crossing the Kansas line, US-56 meets the north end of SH-95. US-56 then enters Kansas on the east edge of Elkhart. =Kansas= Scranton, Kansas on US 56, in 1974 US-56 enters the state at the Kansas/Oklahoma border near Elkhart. It weaves its way across the state from southwest to northeast, passing through such towns as Dodge City, Great Bend, McPherson, Council Grove, and Baldwin City. It joins with I-35/US-50 east of Gardner, and goes northeast with I-35 into the Kansas City Metro Area. It exits the state as part of Shawnee Mission Parkway in Merriam. =Missouri= For one mile (1.6 km) in Kansas City's Country Club Plaza, Route 56 follows the noted boulevard Ward Parkway along with 47th St through the Country Club Plaza. The route ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 71. It also includes Blue Parkway and Swope Parkway at certain points. History Green US-56 marker formerly used in Kansas In the early 1950s, towns along what was then the K-45 corridor, connecting Ellsworth, Kansas to the Oklahoma state line at Elkhart, formed the Mid-Continent Diagonal Highway Association to push for a new highway from Springer, New Mexico (on US 85) northeast across the Oklahoma Panhandle, along K-45, and continuing to Manitowoc, Wisconsin on Lake Michigan. By mid-1954, it was being promoted as U.S. Route 55 between the Great Lakes and the Southwestern United States. The first submissions to the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) to establish the route were made in 1954; all placed the northeast end at Manitowoc, Wisconsin (absorbing US 151 from Cedar Rapids, Iowa), while they varied on whether the southwest end was to be at Albuquerque, New Mexico or Nogales, Arizona. The first route considered in northeast Kansas was via US 40 from Ellsworth to Topeka and K-4 and US 59 via Atchison to St. Joseph, Missouri. A revised route adopted in March 1955, due to AASHO objections to the original route, which traveled concurrently with other U.S. Highways for over half of its length, followed K-14, K-18, US 24, K-63, K-16, and US 59 via Lincoln and Manhattan. In July, the US 50-N Association proposed a plan that would have eliminated US 50N by routing US 55 along most of its length, from Larned east to Baldwin Junction, and then along US 59 to Lawrence and K-10 to Kansas City; towns on US 50N west of Larned, which would have been bypassed, led a successful fight against this. However, in September of that year, the Kansas Highway Commission accepted that plan, taking US 55 east to Kansas City. On June 27, 1956, the AASHO Route Numbering Committee considered this refined plan for US 55, between Springer, New Mexico and Kansas City, Missouri, with a short US 155 along the remaining portion of US 50N from Larned west to Garden City. The committee approved the request, but since the proposed route was more east–west than north–south, it changed it to an even number – US 56 – and the spur to US 156.Oklahoma Department of Transportation, Chronological History Documentation: US 56 (correspondence between ODOT, AASHO, and other DOTs) US 56 originally took a different route between Boise City, Oklahoma and Elkhart, Kansas. The original route followed US 64 east to an intersection south of Eva. It then split off to the north towards Elkhart. By 1961, the section north of US 64 had been overlaid with SH-95. The following year, US 56 was rerouted over SH-114, bringing it to its current diagonal path across the Oklahoma Panhandle. The old alignment is still on the Oklahoma highway system as the north half of SH-95.

The rifle is to replace the 7.62×39mm AKM and 5.45×39mm FB Tantal used in the Polish Armed Forces. Development wz.2004 Beryl with railed forend, vertical forward grip and receiver Picatinny rail (modified version of the wz. 96 Beryl) Development work on a new service rifle (both a standard and carbine variant) adapted to use the intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been undertaken in 1995, however a functioning 5.56 mm rifle and carbine variant had already been available in Radom since 1991, known as the wz. 1991 (a rechambered wz. 1988 Tantal rifle). The new weapon's specifications were approved in February 1995 and in December the same year, a prototype production batch consisting of 11 Beryl rifles was produced. In 1997 the weapon had been successfully evaluated and adopted into service as the 5,56 mm karabinek szturmowy wz. 1996 (\\"assault carbine pattern 1996\\"). The Beryl subsequently became the standard Polish rifle. In 2011, there were more than 45,000 in the inventory, accounting for about half of the assault rifles in the Polish Army.Michał Sitarski, MSBS-5,56 in: Nowa Technika Wojskowa 7/2011, p.32 (in Polish) On May 25, 2016, FB \\"Łucznik\\" Radom announced an order from the Polish Army for 26,000 Beryls and Mini-Beryls, though did not break it down by system.FB \\"Łuchnik\\" Radom, Facebook page. Apart from Poland, 80 wz. 96A Beryls and 10 wz. 96A Mini Beryls are used by Lithuania (donated in May 2000 by Poland, including 10 rifles with Pallad grenade launcher and 10 rifles with CWL-1 scope with integrated laser rangefinder). Until 2002/2003 they were equipment of a special forces unit SOJ Aitvaras, operating in Afghanistan.Remigiusz Wilk (REMOV), G36K/KV dla Litwy in: Raport WTO Nr.12/2007, p. 62 Design details wz. 74 Pallad grenade launcher. Polish army soldiers of the 18th Bielsko Airborne Assault Battalion, wielding Beryl rifles equipped with EOTech sights, during a training exercise at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) in Hohenfels, Germany, December 14, 2006 The Beryl's design layout and system of operation are similar to those of the Tantal rifle, and the principal differences, resulting primarily from using a different cartridge, include the following components: the barrel, receiver housing, buttstock, foregrip, muzzle device, sight system and magazine. With an adapter, it can use M16 NATO standard magazine. The 457 mm-long barrel, has six right-hand grooves and a 228 mm (1:9 in) twist rate. The barrel's external profile (from the breech to the front sight base) is identical to the Tantal's barrel, but the length from the foresight base has a visible tapered contour with a decreasing diameter towards the muzzle end, used to mount a flash suppressor. The flash hider can be used to mount and launch rifle grenades. The flash hider has a slight taper at the front that supports a bayonet and a little further to the rear – six side ports arranged in pairs. These ports are placed asymmetrically around the circumference of the flash hider and stabilize the weapon during continuous fire. Internally the flash suppressor features threading at the muzzle used to screw-in a blank firing attachment. Located mid-length on the flash hider is a cut-out with a ring retainer spring that secures a rifle grenade to the barrel. The receiver housing contains several modifications over the receiver of the wz. 1988 rifle. It uses a reinforced rear stock trunnion, adapted for the new shoulder stock and a top-mounted Picatinny rail for mounting optical sights. The side-folding tubular metal stock is coated with a thermal polymer shrink film. It has a metal shoulder stop covered with a rubber recoil pad. More recent models come with a collapsible stock (see picture of wz. 2004 model on right side of page). The standard lower handguard features an angled rib pattern designed to enhance gripping by the support hand. The rear of the handguard features two molded notches that enable the 40 mm wz. 1974 grenade launcher to be mounted under the barrel (early versions of the wz. 1996 lacked these notches, fitted instead with handguards with lateral grooves). Some Beryl handguards are equipped with short Picatinny rails and an integral vertical foregrip. The Beryl's sighting system is very similar to the setup used on the Tantal, it does however differ with the addition of twin cuts made into the sides of rear sight base that are used to fasten a bracket for mounting the following optical sights: the passive PCS-6 night sight, a CK-3 reflex optical collimator (red dot sight), LKA-4 telescopic sight and CWL-1 scope with integrated laser rangefinder. However, the most used additional sight for Beryl is EOTech 552 holographic weapon sight and PCS-5M passive night sight. PCS-6 and CWL-1 are introduced in small number. The weapon's unique magazine is molded from plastic and is not interchangeable with magazines from the kbk wz. 1988 Tantal. The Beryl has a long, trapezoid-shaped selector switch, similar to those found on the AK-47 or almost all of the AK series. The Beryl fires 5.56×45mm ammunition with a steel-core standard round, a tracer cartridge and a training slug, which are produced by Zakłady Metalowe Mesko in the town of Skarżysko-Kamienna. Standard equipment shipped with the rifle includes: three spare magazines, four 15-round stripper clips, a stripper clip guide, bayonet, cleaning kit, lubricant bottle, cleaning rod (two-piece, stored in the cleaning kit pouch), sling, a magazine pouch and bipod. The rifle can also be fitted with a mounting system for optical sights and a blank-firing adaptor. The Beryl was used to create a carbine variant known as the Mini-Beryl.

In 1921, the 35th Division was reconstituted in the National Guard, allotted to the states of Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska of the Seventh Corps Area, and assigned to the VII Corps. Due to a lack of funding and disputes between the states allotted for the division. the 35th Division headquarters was not organized and federally recognized until 13 September 1935. In the 1920s and 1930s, constituent units of the division performed various activities policing labor troubles and effecting disaster relief. 180 Organized Reserve officers of the 89th and 102nd Divisions were also provided with training by the division. Due to constricted funding, all the units of the 35th Division did not gather together in one place for training until the Fourth Army maneuvers at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1937. The division also concentrated at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, in 1940.Clay, Vol. 1, p. 230-231 =Peacetime activities= 130th Field Artillery Regiment * Riot control duty during a coal miners' strike in Pittsburg, 14 December 1921 – 26 February 1922 * Tornado relief duty in Hutchinson 13–15 January 1923, and Horton, 18–19 June 1923 * Flood relief duty in Hutchinson, July 1929 Clay, Vol. 2, p. 821 134th Infantry Regiment * Riot control duty during a workers' strike at the Nebraska City meat packing plant, 1922 * Flood relief duty along the Republican River, 1935 * Martial law in conjunction with a streetcar workers' strike in Omaha, 7–19 June 1935 Clay, Vol. 1, p. 423 137th Infantry Regiment * Riot control duty during a coal miners' strike in Pittsburg, 14 December 1921 – 26 February 1922 * Tornado relief duty in Augusta, 13–16 July 1924 * Road patrols and bridge blocks during a prison breakout in Lansing, 19–20 January 1934 * Riot control duty during a copper miners' disturbance in Baxter Springs, 8–27 June 1934, and during a coal miners' strike in Columbus, 17 June-6 August 1935 Clay, Vol. 1, p. 424 138th Infantry Regiment  *Riot control duty during a railroad workers' strike in Poplar Bluff, July 1922 *Tornado relief duty in St. Louis, 29 September-6 October 1927 140th Infantry Regiment * Riot control duty at railroad workers' strikes in Moberly, Macon, and Poplar Bluff, 13 July-23 November 1922, and during a workers' strike in New Madrid, May 1923 * Flood relief duty along the Mississippi River at Charleston, Sikeston, and Poplar Bluff, 16 April-12 May 1927 and January 1937, and along the St. Francis River, June 1928, and every spring 1932-1933 and 1935-1938 Clay, Vol. 1, p. 425 142nd Field Artillery Regiment * Flood relief duty in Forrest City, Camp Barton, and Jonesboro, January–February 1937 Clay, Vol. 2, p. 816 161st Field Artillery Regiment * Road patrols and bridge blocks during a prison breakout in Lansing, 19–20 January 1934 * Riot control duty during a coal miners' strike in Columbus, 17–25 June and 28 June-6 August 1935 Clay, Vol. 2, p. 828 =Order of battle, 1924= Italics indicates that the given 35th Division unit was unorganized or inactive at the time. *Headquarters, 35th Division (Missouri National Guard) *Headquarters, Special Troops (Missouri National Guard) **Headquarters Company (Warrensburg, Missouri) **35th Military Police Company (Kansas National Guard) **35th Signal Company (Kansas City, Kansas) **35th Ordnance Company (Medium) (Kansas National Guard) **35th Tank Company (Light) (St. Joseph, Missouri) **Motorcycle Company Number 110 (Kansas National Guard) *69th Infantry Brigade (Topeka, Kansas) **134th Infantry Regiment (Omaha, Nebraska) **137th Infantry Regiment (Horton, Kansas) *70th Infantry Brigade (Jefferson City, Missouri) **138th Infantry Regiment (St. Louis, Missouri) **140th Infantry Regiment (Caruthersville, Missouri) *60th Field Artillery Brigade (Topeka, Kansas) **110th Ammunition Train (Kansas National Guard) **130th Field Artillery Regiment (Topeka, Kansas) **161st Field Artillery Regiment (Topeka, Kansas) *110th Engineer Regiment (Kansas City, Missouri) *110th Medical Regiment (Lincoln, Nebraska) *35th Division Trains (Lincoln, Nebraska) *35th Division Air Service (St. Louis, Missouri) Clay, Vol. 1, p. 231 =Order of battle, 1939= *Headquarters, 35th Division (Fort Leavenworth, Kansas) *Headquarters, Special Troops (St. Joseph, Missouri) **Headquarters Company (Warrensburg, Missouri) **35th Military Police Company (Garden City, Kansas) **35th Signal Company (Kansas City, Kansas) **35th Ordnance Company (Medium) (Kansas National Guard) **35th Tank Company (Light) (St. Joseph, Missouri) *69th Infantry Brigade (Omaha, Nebraska) **134th Infantry Regiment (Omaha, Nebraska) **137th Infantry Regiment (Horton, Kansas) *70th Infantry Brigade (Jefferson City, Missouri) **138th Infantry Regiment (St. Louis, Missouri) **140th Infantry Regiment (Caruthersville, Missouri) *60th Field Artillery Brigade (Topeka, Kansas) **110th Ammunition Train (Kansas National Guard) **130th Field Artillery Regiment (Topeka, Kansas) **142nd Field Artillery Regiment (El Dorado, Arkansas) **161st Field Artillery Regiment (Topeka, Kansas) *110th Engineer Regiment (Kansas City, Missouri) *110th Medical Regiment (Lincoln, Nebraska) *110th Quartermaster Regiment (Lincoln, Nebraska) World War II =Federalization= The 35th Division was ordered into federal service on 23 December 1940 at home stations. The division's units were ordered to report to Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas, and had arrived by the end of January, 1941. The incomplete ranks of the 35th were swelled by thousands of draftees, a large portion of whom, through the allowance of local recruitment while National Guard divisions were increasing their strength, were ordered to join the division from the states where the division's units had originated. After completing the War Department-mandated divisional training program, the 35th Division maneuvered against other units in Arkansas and Louisiana in the fall of 1941. After the Pearl Harbor attack came its first assignment, the defense of the Southern California Sector of the Western Defense Command. Reorganization On 3 February 1942, the 35th Division was \\"triangularized,\\" losing its infantry and field artillery brigade headquarters. The 138th Infantry Regiment departed, assigned to GHQ. The 35th Division's engineer, field artillery, quartermaster, and medical regiments were reorganized as battalions.

The 35th Infantry Division arrived in England on 25 May 1944 and received further training. It landed on Omaha Beach, Normandy 5–7 July 1944 and entered combat on 11 July, fighting in the Normandy hedgerows north of St. Lo. The division beat off twelve German counterattacks at Emelie before entering St. Lo on 18 July. After mopping up in the St. Lo area, it took part in the offensive action southwest of St. Lo, pushing the Germans across the Vire River on 2 August, and breaking out of the Cotentin Peninsula. While en route to an assembly area, the division was \\"flagged off the road,\\" to secure the Mortain-Avranches corridor and to rescue the 30th Division's \\"Lost Battalion\\" August 7–13, 1944. Then racing across France through Orleans and Sens, the division attacked across the Moselle on 13 September, captured Nancy on 15 September, secured Chambrey on 1 October, and drove on to the German border, taking Sarreguemines and crossing the Saar on 8 December. After crossing the Blies River on 12 December, the division moved to Metz for rest and rehabilitation on 19 December. The 35th moved to Arlon, Belgium December 25–26, and took part in the fighting to relieve Bastogne, throwing off the attacks of four German divisions, taking Villers- laBonne-Eau on 10 January, after a 13-day fight and Lutrebois in a 5-day engagement. On 18 January 1945, the division returned to Metz to resume its interrupted rest. In late January, the division was defending the Foret de Domaniale area. Moving to the Netherlands to hold a defensive line along the Roer on 22 February, the division attacked across the Roer on 23 February, pierced the Siegfried Line, reached the Rhine at Wesel on 10 March, and crossed 25–26 March. It smashed across the Herne Canal and reached the Ruhr River early in April, when it was ordered to move to the Elbe April 12. Making the 295-mile dash in two days, the 35th mopped up in the vicinity of Colbitz and Angern, until 26 April 1945 when it moved to Hanover for occupational and mopping-up duty, continuing occupation beyond VE-day. The division left Southampton, England, on 5 September, and arrived in New York City on 10 September 1945.

In 1963 the division was inactivated along with three other National Guard divisions. In early 1983, the Army began the process of reestablishing the division as a mechanized infantry formation to be made up of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, and Kentucky National Guard units. The division headquarters was established 30 September 1983, at Fort Leavenworth. The division was formally reactivated as the 35th Infantry Division (Mechanized) on 25 August 1984 from the 67th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Nebraska, the 69th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Kansas, and the 149th Armored Brigade from Kentucky.David Isby and Charles Kamps Jr., Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company, 1985, p.383.

A Schnauzer (, plural Schnauzer, lit. translation \\"snouter\\") is a dog breed type that originated in Germany from the 14th to 16th centuries. The term comes from the German word for \\"snout\\" and means colloquially \\"moustache\\",Schnauzer at Merriam-Webster Dictionary or \\"whiskered snout\\", because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout.\\"Schnauzer\\" at Encyclopædia Britannica. Initially it was called Wire- Haired Pinscher, while Schnauzer was adopted in 1879. Breeds There are three breeds: the Standard, the Giant, and the Miniature. Toy and teacup are not breeds of Schnauzer, but these common terms are used to market undersized or ill-bred Miniature Schnauzers. The original Schnauzer was of the same size as the modern Standard Schnauzer breed and was bred as a rat-catcher and guard dog. The Giant Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer were developed from the Standard Schnauzer and are the result of outcrosses with other breeds exhibiting the desirable characteristics needed for the Schnauzer's original purpose. By the VDH and FCI Schnauzer is placed in \\"Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers\\", with \\"Nr. 181, 182 and 183\\" in \\"Section 1.2: Schnauzer\\" dedicated to all three Schnauzer breeds. * Standard Schnauzers (also known as Mittelschnauzers) are around tall at the shoulder and weigh . They are in the group of working dogs, bred as multifunctional dogs to catch rats and other rodents, as livestock and guard dogs, and later they have also carried messages in times of war, helped the Red Cross and been police dogs. It is considered to have a common ancestry with the German Pinscher as a wire- haired coated variant of the Pinscher breed, and was possibly crossed with black German Poodle and gray Wolf Spitz, to which influence is attributed the black soft coat and the salt-and-pepper gray wiry coat. * Giant Schnauzers (also known as Riesenschnauzers) are around tall at the shoulder and weigh between . They are working dogs that were developed in Swabia in the 17th century, once known as the Munich Schnauzer, originally bred to drive livestock to market and guard farms, and later used as police and military dogs. The cynologists believe that the Giant Schnauzer was developed independently through crosses of black Great Danes, Munchener German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer. * Miniature Schnauzers (also known as Zwergschnauzers) are around tall at the shoulder and weigh between .amsc.us Miniature Schnauzer Breed Club Standard They were developed since the late 19th century, and the cynologists consider that the Miniature Schnauzer is the result of crossing the original Standard Schnauzer with a smaller breed like the Affenpinscher, and Miniature Poodle. The Miniature Schnauzer is classified as a utility (UK, Australia, New Zealand) or terrier group (USA, Canada), however, they are not related to the terrier group as do not have the typical terrier temperament, coat, shape of head and body. The American Kennel Club (AKC) approves salt and pepper, black, and black and silver as acceptable coat colors for a Miniature Schnauzer. They are also bred in pure white or even parti-colored, but neither is approved by the AKC.amsc.us Catherine McMillan (AMSC) In 2004, the Miniature Schnauzer accounted for 2.4% of proportion of purebred dogs registered by the AKC. Genetics In a 2004 population genetics study of 85 purebred dogs, which used cluster-based methods with four identified genetic clusters, all three Schnauzer breeds structurally mostly clustered within \\"recent European descent, largely terriers and hounds\\" cluster, with less percent within \\"working breeds\\" and \\"Molosser-type breeds\\" clusters, while the \\"Asian breeds/ancient hounds and spitz-type breed\\" cluster was present among Giant Schnauzers. In a 2007 Collie eye anomaly study of 638 dogs from 132 distinct breeds, with five specimens of each Schnauzer breed size, in the population structure of the microsatellite analysis they mostly clustered in the \\"hunting group\\" rather than the \\"mastiff/terrier group\\". In a 2010 GWAS study using more than 48,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 915 dogs from 85 breeds, Standard and Giant Schnauzers made a separate phylogenetic tree branch clustered among \\"modern\\" breeds (i.e. \\"working dogs\\"), and not the \\"small terrier\\"/\\"mastiff-terrier\\" cluster, sharing genetic closeness with the Doberman Pinscher, the German Shepherd Dog and the Portuguese Water Dog. In the most recent 2017 WGS study of 1,346 dogs from 161 breeds, Standard and Miniature Schnauzers made one separate phylogenetic clade of 23 clades and formed a unique broader clade in which they share common ancestry with spitz-type breeds such as the American Eskimo Dog, the Pomeranian and the Volpino Italiano, as well as the Schipperke, the Papillon, the Brussells Griffon and the Pug. Although the Giant Schnauzer shares a haplotype with the other two Schnauzer breeds, it made a phylogentic node in a separate clade, sharing common ancestry with the Black Russian Terrier, the Rottweiler and the Doberman Pinscher. In another 2017 WGS study researching the genetic variants for the development of short tails among dog breeds, the sampled (Miniature) Schnauzer and Rottweiler have \\"short tail phenotype caused by the unknown genetic factors\\" and \\"are predicted to have developed short tail independently\\". Description Schnauzer running The breed is of above average intelligence and can be independent minded, so early training and diverse daily exercise are recommended.dogtime.com, Standard Schnauzer Based on Stanley Coren's book The Intelligence of Dogs (2006) ranking methodology, the Miniature ranked 12th, Standard 18th, and Giant 28th out of 140 breeds within 79 ranks on the ability to learn and obey new commands i.e. working and obedience intelligence. The first two were grouped among \\"excellent working dogs\\", while the Giant among \\"above-average working dogs\\". Additionally, experts ranked the Miniature as 5th among top 15 breeds at watchdog barking ability, the Giant as 6th among top 13 breeds at effective guard ability, while in adaptive intelligence all three breeds showed good problem-solving abilities. They are protective and energetic, and will alert members of the household to any potential danger, although its watchful nature can lead to persistent barking. To avoid annoying the neighbors, dog owners should make every effort to curb excessive barking through training. Schnauzers have distinctive beards and long, feathery eyebrows. They are generally either a salt and pepper colour, black, or white, but they can be brown also. Some owners shave their Schnauzers down the back while the hairs on their legs are kept long and curly, but this may change the coat colour, so show Schnauzers especially will have their back coat \\"stripped\\" by hand, to encourage the salt and pepper pattern to emerge. It was traditional to have the tails docked and the ears cropped to give an alert appearance but in other countries like Europe, it is illegal. For working dogs that are ratters, these procedures don't give the rat anything to grab on to when being attacked and therefore cannot fight back. Cropping and docking are now illegal in the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand, and are becoming less common elsewhere. The Schnauzer's beard and leg hair should be brushed often to prevent mats from forming. Schnauzers have a double coat. The top or guard coat is wiry, while the undercoat is soft. Stripping removes the undercoat and stimulates the hard top coat to come in fuller. The undercoat coat should be \\"stripped\\" (loose, dead hair is plucked) at least twice a year. A stripped Schnauzer will have a hard wiry coat as described in the breed standard. A shaved pet will lose the hard top coat and only exhibit the soft undercoat.strippingknives.com, Grooming Schnauzers are a type of dog that sheds less often than most dogs.

Rex, on the site where he died in a car crash in Barnes, London, on 16 September 1977. Bolan was a passenger in a car which hit a sycamore tree on Queen's Ride (part of the B306, close to Gipsy Lane). A memorial stone was unveiled at the site in 1997, and a bust of Bolan added in 2002. Origins The Bolan Tree in June 1978 Marc Bolan died, aged 29, from injuries sustained when his purple Mini, driven by his girlfriend Gloria Jones, crashed. Jones lost control of the car and it struck a steel reinforced chain link fence post, and came to rest against a sycamore tree after failing to negotiate a small humpback bridge, near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, southwest London. From the day of the accident the site became a place of pilgrimage to Bolan fans and this was reported in various newspapers from 1978 onwards. Coincidentally the registration number of the car was FOX 661L and within the lyrics of his single \\"Solid Gold Easy Action\\" are the lines \\"Easy as picking foxes from a tree\\" and \\"Woman from the east with her headlights shining\\" In September 1997, the Performing Right Society (PRS) installed a memorial stone for Bolan, facing into Gipsy Lane at the base of the embankment from the \\"Bolan Tree\\" located in Queen's Ride. In 1999 the T-Rex Action Group (TAG) was formed with the specific aim of caring for the site. TAG were granted an in perpetuity lease on the site with ownership and full responsibility for the \\"Bolan Tree\\". During 2000, TAG built steps up the muddy embankment between the \\"Bolan Tree\\" on Queen's Ride and the PRS memorial stone facing Gipsy Lane and took the action needed to make the tree safe so that the threat of falling was removed. In 2002, a bronze bust of Bolan paid for exclusively by T-Rex Action Group founder Fee Warner, and sculpted by Canadian sculptor Jean Robillard, was unveiled by Bolan's only child – Rolan Bolan. In 2005, memorial plaques were fitted to the steps to remember other members of T-Rex who have also died: Steve Peregrin Took, Steve Currie, Mickey Finn and Dino Dines. A memorial plaque was also included for Marc Bolan's wife June Bolan (née Child) as recognition for her contribution to his success. Official recognition  In February 2007, the 30th anniversary year of Marc Bolan's death, the work done by the T-Rex Action Group since 1999 was recognised by the English Tourist Board's publication of its new guide England Rocks which features 113 \\"Sites of Rock 'n' Roll Importance\\" in England. In London, 29 sights are listed, but many are \\"general sites\\" such as Abbey Road and Wembley Stadium which are not \\"person-specific\\".

The reason for this error is that the transcriber of the Book of Kells read \\"QUI FUIT MATHATHIAE\\" as \\"QUI FUIT MATHATH  IAE,\\" in which he considered IAE an additional individual (and so he added another QUI FUIT), rather than the Latin ending of \\"Matthew.\\" * Matthew 10:34b should read \\"I came not to send peace, but the sword\\".

According to Rimmer – who is revealed in another episode to have the middle name Judas due to his parents' unconventional take on Christianity – the Hoppists' unique form of worship arose from a misprinted Bible wherein 1 Corinthians 13:13 reads \\"Faith, hop and charity, and the greatest of these is hop.\\" The membership consequently spent every Sunday hopping. Rimmer says he never agreed with the faith, but claims to be liberal on religious matters. * The Poisonwood Bible is a 1998 bestselling novel by Barbara Kingsolver which mentions some of the famous \\"misprint Bibles\\" such as the Camel Bible, the Murderer's Bible, and the Bug Bible.

Synopsis The show starred Lally Cadeau as Kate Brown, the attractive and charismatic director of a youth drop-in centre in Toronto, and blended both comedy and drama in its portrayal of genuine teen counselling problems.\\"CBC sitcom Hangin' In deals with the issues that concern teenagers in an entertaining way\\", Toronto Star, November 1, 1986. David Eisner starred as Michael DiFalco, a young, affable staff counsellor, and Ruth Springford appeared as Doris Webster, the centre's receptionist. Many young Canadian actors, including Eric McCormack, Keanu Reeves, Jessica Steen and Mark Humphrey, made guest appearances as teenaged clients of the youth centre. During the show's final season, Cadeau was replaced for the final five episodes by Fiona Reid as Maggie.\\"CBC show hangin' in with Reid\\". Toronto Star, October 6, 1986.

In addition, the theoretical and practical aspects of cryptanalysis, or codebreaking, were much advanced. Probably the most important codebreaking event of the war was the successful decryption by the Allies of the German \\"Enigma\\" Cipher. The first complete break into Enigma was accomplished by Poland around 1932; the techniques and insights used were passed to the French and British Allies just before the outbreak of the war in 1939. They were substantially improved by British efforts at the Bletchley Park research station during the war. Decryption of the Enigma Cipher allowed the Allies to read important parts of German radio traffic on important networks and was an invaluable source of military intelligence throughout the war. Intelligence from this source (and other high level sources, including the Fish ciphers) was eventually called Ultra. A similar break into the most secure Japanese diplomatic cipher, designated Purple by the US Army Signals Intelligence Service, started before the US entered the war.

He calls himself a \\"Director of Behavior\\". He has been described in Art in America as \\"one of the most interesting performance artists anywhere\\".Currie, Nick, \\"600 Words with Michael Portnoy\\", Art in America, August 2009 Background and early work Portnoy was born in Washington, D.C., and studied comparative literature and creative writing at Vassar College and theater at the National Theater Institute at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. After moving to New York City, he formed several short-lived experimental theater groups and then began concentrating on solo performance. His early performance works, such as Gymnastics and Schizophrenia and 5teen3sy: Kicking Games of Lip, were antic and unpredictable, and characterized by dense language play, song and movement fragments and rapid transformations of character. In the mid 1990s, Portnoy regularly performed in venues such as Surf Reality and Luna Lounge's weekly show \\"Eating It\\", the epicenter of New York's alternative comedy scene. His wild and abstract theatrical performances, which occasionally interrupted and challenged other comedians on stage, prompted Time Out New York to describe him as \\"the bad boy of comedy\\",True, Cynthia. \\"Alterna Be thy Name\\", Time Out New York, June 5–12, 1996, pp. 43–44. and the New York Post to dub him \\"the next Andy Kaufman\\".PAGE SIX, New York Post, December 15, 1999 At the same time, Portnoy started working as a dancer for the New York choreographer Koosil-Ja Hwang, and as an actor. He also sang and performed his own operatic, electro-progressive-rock music as XAR, and with the band The Liquid Tapedeck. Soy Bomb For Bob Dylan's performance of \\"Love Sick\\" at the 1998 Grammy Awards, Portnoy was hired by Dylan's production company to stand in the background with other dancers and groove to the music to \\"give Bob a good vibe\\". Instead, halfway through the performance, Portnoy ripped off his shirt, ran next to Dylan, and started dancing and contorting spastically with the two-word poem \\"Soy Bomb\\" written across his chest. When questioned by reporters, Portnoy explained the poem's meaning: \\"Soy... represents dense nutritional life. Bomb is, obviously, an explosive destructive force. So, soy bomb is what I think art should be: dense, transformational, explosive life\\" according to Entertainment WeeklyBrunner, Rob. \\"Bombs Away\\", Entertainment Weekly, March 13, 1998, p. 14 and that \\"he meant Soy Bomb as a 'spontaneous explosion of the self' to re- invigorate the current music scene.Derek Yip. \\"MICHAEL PORTNOY aka SOY BOMB, Upstart Pissing on the Contemporary Mix\\", Performing Arts Journal, No. 61 (January 1999), pp. 36-44 He has also said that the phrase is a combination of Spanish and English, meaning \\"the bomb of 'I am'\\". The Grammys chose not to press charges against Portnoy for the act, but he was not paid the $200 fee for the gig. The event was parodied on Saturday Night Live, where he was portrayed by Will Ferrell, and on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In 2005, the band Eels included the track \\"Whatever Happened to Soy Bomb\\" on the double- disc album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. In 2016, the TV show Broad City parodied Soy Bomb with a performance artist character played by musician Har Mar Superstar.  Portnoy: 1999–present  Michael Portnoy's TALUS abstract gambling table, 2007 Portnoy expanded his practice to include choreography, video, installation, sculpture, painting, participatory works and curation. His projects have included Google Office 0.2, a project for the 2010 Taipei Biennial that involved the formation of a think tank called The Improvement League, which operated by improving existing artworks in the Biennial by pruning and hybridizing in a cross between futurology and conceptual horticulture. Portnoy's long-standing investigation of social exchange, and the rules of communication and play, has been conducted through a series of 'abstract gambling' tables for Casino Ilinx (2008) and Filzzungeungewiss (2009); and conversation or inventional games drawing on 17th century universal or taxonomic languages for Fran Spafa Feda (2010); and the game-show format of 27 Gnosis (2012).  Relational Stalinism  Central to many of Portnoy's projects is his tongue-in-cheek concept of 'Relational Stalinism', a form of relational aesthetics that works against \\"the fashionable promise that an artwork might offer a democratic magic, transforming inter-relational codes into something nicer…\\"Tirdad Zolghadr. Creamier: Contemporary Art in Culture: 10 Curators, 100 Contemporary Artists, 10 Sources, Phaidon Press, 2010, pp. 192-193. Unlike other artists who produce participatory artworks, Portnoy undermines the creation of a harmonious community by setting as many limitations as possible on the participants and then introducing destabilizing mechanisms, such as changing the rules in the middle of the game. This breed of absurdist, dictatorial interaction with participants is \\"a clarification of the artist's imperious role as producer and performer\\". Contrary to many contemporary participatory events, these schemes value confusion, complication, and ambiguity over predictable outcomes, and the goal is to stretch and dislocate the participants by complicating their behavior and language in the service of riotous invention. By acting as the \\"Director of Behavior\\" and constantly modifying the standards of the game, Portnoy forces the participants to construct unexpected worlds and new modes of communication.  Experimental comedy  Much of Portnoy’s work is also framed by what he calls experimental comedy, or \\"the injection of the sublime, the blatantly inscrutable, the abstract, the primal, the choreographic, the theoretical, the improbable, the generative, the post- rhythmic, the turbo-stupid, etc., into the frame of stand-up\\".After Berkeley: Objectif Exhibitions, 2010–2011, Sternberg Press, 2012 This has been manifested in the operatic stand-up routine of The K Sound (2006), Taipei Women’s Experimental Comedy Club (2010), and Script Opposition in Late-Model Carrot Jokes (2011), a project that investigated the \\"carrot joke\\", a term used in cognitive linguistics to describe a poem-like joke with a high degree of ambiguity, blunt omissions of information and logical faults and inconsistencies. In carrot jokes \\"incongruities are rarely resolved and just pile on top of each other … Since the ground or ‘script’ is always shifting, the listener keeps trying to determine whether there is an overall story that could explain what the hell is going on\\".

Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale, (29 September 1903 – 10 March 1973) was Governor of Southern Rhodesia from 1942 to 1944, High Commissioner for Southern Africa from 1944 to 1951, and Governor of Kenya from 1952 to 1959. Baring played an integral role in the suppression of the Mau Mau uprising. Together with Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd, Baring played a significant role in the government's efforts to keep the abuses carried out during the suppression of the Mau Mau revolt from the British public.  Education and early career  Baring followed in the footsteps of his father, the famed \\"Maker of Modern Egypt\\"–– Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer. Baring graduated from Oxford University with First Class Honours in modern history before serving in the Indian Civil Service. He then joined Britain's Foreign Office, where he was sent first to Southern Rhodesia before being posted in South Africa as High Commissioner. Seretse Khama affair In 1949, as British High Commissioner in South Africa, Baring played a key role in preventing Seretse Khama, the heir to the throne of the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, from becoming its king. This action he recommended to the British government on the grounds that Khama had wed a white English woman, Ruth Williams, and that the inter-racial marriage had been opposed by apartheid South Africa, a neighbouring state. Working in close collaboration with Percivale Liesching, who was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations at the time, Baring was able to persuade government ministers not only that Khama should be prevented from becoming king but that he should be exiled from his country. Baring's role in what became known as the Seretse Khama affair is documented in Colour Bar: The Triumph of Seretse Khama and His NationWilliams, Susan. 2006. Colour Bar. Allen Lane by the historian Susan Williams. Governorship in Kenya As Governor of Kenya, Baring declared a State of Emergency on 20 October 1952 before launching Operation Jock Scott, which targeted Mau Mau leaders, especially Jomo Kenyatta. In June 1957, Baring passed on to Alan Lennox-Boyd a secret memorandum written by Eric Griffiths-Jones, the attorney general of Kenya. The memorandum described the abuse of Mau Mau detainees. The paper alleges that Baring supplied a covering letter that asserted that inflicting \\"violent shock\\" was the only way of dealing with Mau Mau insurgents. Career after Kenya Baring left Kenya in 1959. He returned to his family estate of Howick Hall, which was inherited by his wife Lady Mary Cecil Grey, daughter of Charles Grey, 5th Earl Grey. He was known to enjoy birdwatching. He later accepted a post with the government's Colonial Development Corporation. Marriage and children Baring married Lady Mary Cecil Grey, daughter of Charles Grey, 5th Earl Grey, and Lady Mabel Laura Georgiana Palmer (daughter of William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne), on 24 April 1935.

The book is a bestseller, with more than four million copies sold since its publication. Its characters and events are loosely based on aspects of Eugenides' life and observations of his Greek heritage. It is not an autobiography; unlike the protagonist, Eugenides is not intersex. The author decided to write Middlesex after reading the 1980 memoir Herculine Barbin and was dissatisfied with its discussion of intersex anatomy and emotions. Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) and family saga, the novel chronicles the effect of a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing experiences of what society constructs as polar opposites—such as those found between men and women. It discusses the pursuit of the American Dream and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts. Narrator and protagonist Cal Stephanides (initially called \\"Callie\\") is an intersex man of Greek descent with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which causes him to have certain feminine traits. The first half of the novel is about Cal's family and depicts his grandparents' migration from Bursa, a city in Asia Minor, to the United States in 1922. It follows their assimilation into U.S. society in Detroit, Michigan, then a booming industrial city. The latter half of the novel, set in the late 20th century, focuses on Cal's experiences in his hometown of Detroit and his escape to San Francisco, where he comes to terms with his modified gender identity. Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review considered Middlesex one of the best books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel. Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides' depiction of his hometown of Detroit—praising him for his social commentary. Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club. Conception, research, and publication After publishing his first novel, The Virgin Suicides, in 1993, Jeffrey Eugenides started on his next project Middlesex. He was inspired by having read Herculine Barbin, the diary of a 19th-century French convent schoolgirl who was intersex. Eugenides had first read the memoir a decade earlier and believed it evaded discussion about the anatomy and emotions of intersex people. He intended Middlesex to be \\"the story [he] wasn't getting from the memoir\\". Eugenides found the environment at MacDowell Colony productive. Eugenides worked on Middlesex for nine years. He started writing during his short-term residence at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, United States, and finished the novel in Berlin, Germany; he had accepted a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service in 1999. Eugenides spent the first few years trying to establish the narrative voice for his novel. He wanted to \\"[tell] epic events in the third person and psychosexual events in the first person\\". According to Eugenides, the voice \\"had to render the experience of a teenage girl and an adult man, or an adult male-identified hermaphrodite\\". Although Eugenides sought expert advice about intersex, sexology, and the formation of gender identity, he refrained from meeting with intersex people, saying, \\"[I] decided not to work in that reportorial mode. Instead of trying to create a separate person, I tried to pretend that I had this [physical feature] and that I had lived through this as much as I could\\". Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an \\"elusive historical figure\\". He discovered details of what he considered a vivid intersex condition while browsing Columbia University's medical library. After discovering in his library research 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, an autosomal recessive condition manifested primarily in inbred, isolated population groups, his perception of the novel significantly changed. Rather than a \\"slim fictional autobiography\\" of an intersex individual, the novel would be epic in scope, tracing the lives of three generations of Greek Americans. Eugenides lived in Brooklyn when he began his first draft of the novel. He went through a lengthy brainstorming process. He would write 50 pages in one voice, restart in a different voice with 75 pages, and then pursue a different narrative angle. He wanted the novel to be an \\"intimate\\" portrayal of protagonist Cal's transformation, so he wrote a draft in the first-person narrative in Cal's voice. He could not, however, portray Cal's grandparents intimately, so he completely abandoned his preceding year's draft in favor of writing the book in the third-person. He gradually violated his narrative convention by restoring the first-person voice amid the third-person narration to depict the mindsets of both Cal and Cal's grandparents. During the writing process, Eugenides moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan and later returned to Brooklyn. Worried about the narrative's sounding forced, he added instances of \\"self- reflexivity\\" to Cal's voice. After several years of struggling with the narrative voice, Eugenides finally seated himself at his desk and wrote Middlesexs initial page, \\"500 words that contained the DNA for the protein synthesis of the entire book.\\" Middlesex was published for the North American market in September 2002 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in the United States and Vintage Canada for Canada. A month later, it was released in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing. The novel has been translated into 34 languages; the Spanish-language edition was translated by Benito Gómez Ibáñez and released in 2003 after the publisher, Jorge Herralde, had acquired the rights in a \\"tough auction\\". Plot Cal (his masculine identity), also known as Calliope (feminine), recounts how 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a recessive condition, caused him to be born with female characteristics. The book continues with accounts of his family's history, starting with his paternal grandparents in their home village and ending with his father's funeral. These accounts cover the conception of Cal, his teenage years, and the discovery of his intersex condition. Throughout the book, Cal weaves his opinion of the events in hindsight and of his life after his father's funeral. Eugenides sets Middlesex in the 20th century and interjects historical elements, such as the Balkan Wars, the Nation of Islam, the 1967 Detroit riot, and the Watergate scandal in the story. Cal's grandparents flee from Smyrna, boarding a passenger ship, as the city burns in flames. The accounts of Cal's family history start in 1922. His grandfather, Eleutherios \\"Lefty\\" Stephanides, lives in Bithynios, a village in Asia Minor. Eugenides places the village high on the slope of Mount Olympos, above the city of Bursa, and describes incestuous marriages between cousins as a quietly accepted custom among the villagers. Lefty makes a living selling silkworm cocoons harvested by his sister, Desdemona. The siblings are orphans; their parents are victims of the ongoing Greco-Turkish War. As the war progresses, Lefty and Desdemona develop a romantic relationship. Fleeing the chaos brought by the war, they board a ship amid the Great Fire of Smyrna and set sail for the United States. Their histories unknown to the other passengers, they marry each other on board the vessel. After arriving in New York, they locate their cousin, Sourmelina \\"Lina\\" Zizmo, in Detroit, Michigan, and go to stay with her. Lina is a closeted lesbian and the only person there to know of the siblings' incestuous relationship. Starting a new life, Lefty takes on a job at Ford Motor Company, but is later retrenched. He unknowingly joins Lina's husband, Jimmy, in bootlegging. Desdemona gives birth to a son, Milton, and later a daughter, Zoe. Lina gives birth to a daughter, Theodora or \\"Tessie\\". The relationship between Lefty and Desdemona declines after she learns that there is an increased chance of genetic disease for children born from incest. In 1924, after Milton's birth, Lefty opens a bar and gambling room, calling it the Zebra Room. Milton and Tessie marry in 1946. They have two children, Chapter Eleven and Calliope (\\"Callie\\"). Prior to Callie's birth, Desdemona predicts the child to be a boy, although the parents prepare for a girl. Chapter Eleven is a biologically \\"normal\\" boy; however, Callie is intersex. Her family members are unaware of her situation for many years, so they raise Callie as a girl. Elements of family life are portrayed against the rise and fall of industrial Detroit, where so many struggled. The family gets caught up in the 1967 Detroit riot resulting from racial tensions, after President Johnson authorizes the use of federal troops. The family home is raided during this period, to the shock of the parents. After this harrowing experience, the family moves to a house on Middlesex Boulevard, Grosse Pointe. When she is 14 years old, Callie falls in love with her female best friend, whom Callie refers to as the \\"Obscure Object\\". In separate encounters, Callie has her first sexual experiences with a woman, the Obscure Object, and with a man, the Obscure Object's brother. After Callie is injured by a tractor, a doctor discovers that she is intersex. She is taken to a clinic in New York and undergoes a series of tests and examinations. After learning about the syndrome and facing the prospect of sex reassignment surgery, Callie runs away and assumes a male identity as Cal. He hitchhikes cross-country and reaches San Francisco, where he joins a burlesque show as Hermaphroditus. Cal is arrested by the police during a raid on his workplace. He is released into Chapter Eleven's custody and learns of their father's death. The siblings return to their family home on Middlesex. In a private moment, Desdemona recognizes Cal's condition, associating it with stories from her old village about children born of incest. She confesses to Cal that her husband, Lefty, is also her brother. As Milton's funeral takes place at the church, Cal stands in the doorway of his family home, assuming the male-only role in Greek traditions to keep his father's spirit from re-entering the family home. Several years later, Cal becomes a diplomat stationed in Berlin. He meets Julie Kikuchi, a Japanese-American woman, and tentatively starts a relationship with her. Autobiographical elements Although he says it was not autobiographical, Jeffrey Eugenides based many details of Middlesex on his own life. Reporters and critics noted that many characters and events in Middlesex parallel those in Eugenides' life. The author denied writing the novel as an autobiography. In an interview by National Public Radio in 2002, he commented on the similarities: Eugenides blended fact and fiction in his book. Like Cal, the author was born in 1960; unlike his creation, he is not intersex or transgender. His family moved to a house on Middlesex Road in Grosse Pointe after the Detroit riot in 1967. Eugenides studied at University Liggett School, a private institution that served as a model for Callie's Baker and Inglis School for Girls. He tapped into his own \\"locker room trauma\\", an adolescent experience of being naked among many other nude bodies, and used it to develop Callie's self-discovery of her body during puberty. He based the name of the character the \\"Obscure Object\\" on a Brown University classmate whom he found alluring and to whom he gave that nickname. Eugenides married a Japanese-American artist, Karen Yamauchi, and moved to Berlin. Eugenides is of Greek heritage, albeit only through his father's side. Although his paternal grandparents were not siblings like the Stephanides, they were silk farmers like their fictional counterparts. Also like Cal, Eugenides learned some Greek customs to help himself understand his grandparents better. The Zebra Room and the bartender profession are other items shared by their grandfathers; Eugenides said the inclusion of the bar was a deliberate \\"secret code of paying homage to my grandparents and my parents.\\" Several aspects of Chapter Eleven were based on Eugenides' elder brother, who withdrew from society during a \\"hippie phase\\" in his life. While revising and editing the book, the author removed information that could be offensive to his relatives. Not all such material was excised, Eugenides said: \\"There may still be things in there that will sting.\\" Style Several reviewers considered Middlesex to be overly verbose. The Economist described the novel as \\"ponderous\\" and said that the main story (that of Cal) does not \\"get off the ground until halfway through\\" the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus \\"footloose\\" in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with \\"verbose voluptuousness\\". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, \\"I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out.\\" A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did \\"both background and foreground in all the necessary detail\\", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them \\"elaborately justified and motivated\\". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt (\\"I remember the first time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages\\") to the \\"trashily journalistic\\" (\\"You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [a heavy smoker] was an exhalation artist\\") on several occasions. Humor and irony are frequently used in the book. Mark Lawson of The Guardian considered the narrator's tone to be \\"sardonic[ally] empath[etic]\\", and other critics have characterized the beginning of the novel as comical. When Cal is baptized as an infant by Father Mike, a Greek Orthodox clergyman, the priest receives a surprise: \\"From between my cherubic legs a stream of crystalline liquid shot into the air ... Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... [and] struck Father Mike right in the middle of the face.\\" Derek Weiler of the Toronto Star noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the \\"horrific qualities of public men's rooms\\". The author employed another writing device--abrupt incongruity--in describing Desdemona's physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her \\"braids were not delicate like a little girl's but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver's tail\\". According to Penelope Music of Book Magazine, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from \\"run-of-the- mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy\\". An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal's grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that \\"[s]hameful as it is to say, the riots were the best thing that ever happened to us.\\" The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout. =Narrative modes= Middlesex is written in the form of a memoir, and switches between the first and the third person in several spots. Used as a comedic device, the third person narratives illustrate Cal's estrangement from Calliope: When he refers to her in the third person, he is identifying her as someone other than him. Patricia Chu, a scholar of English literature, noted the effectiveness of this style in the chapter in which the adolescent Callie searches for information on hermaphroditism. As the teenager reads Webster's Dictionary, following the trail of definitions related to her condition, she reaches the entry for hermaphrodite. The narration switches from personal to external, lending poignancy to the character's final discovery as she confronts the word \\"monster\\". Although the protagonist switches gender throughout the book, Cal's manners of speech and thought are identical to Callie's. Believing that males and females have no inherent disparities in their writing styles, Eugenides treated Cal and Callie as the same person, in terms of narrative voice. He also fixed the narrative voice in terms of age by setting up Cal to relate the entire story at one time. Eugenides gave his protagonist a mostly male outlook, justifying his treatment with the reasoning that Cal or Callie was a man in terms of appearance, sexual desires, and the brain. He asked his wife and other women to review his approaches on Cal's feminine views. The \\"emotional stuff\\" was accurate but Eugenides had to refine certain details, such as those about toenail polish. At the beginning of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this \\"mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle\\" and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, \\"Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this.\\" However, he later says, \\"I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on.\\" Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief. Mullan remarked that Eugenides' narrator has a proclivity to reveal events that will happen in the future. Cal is a narrator who is absorbed in how his fate has been shaped. Cal eschews a chronological telling of the story, where he shares the characters' nescience. He chooses instead to relate the story beginning with his future knowledge. Cal's genes reflect an anticipation of the future: the disclosure of his actual sex identity. Cal mimics this \\"genetic inevitability\\" by enjoining the readers to know the future prior to its occurring. Mullan observed that \\"[f]or the reader, apprehension predominates over surprise\\" as a result of this narrative style. =Genres= Middlesex sets up its characters to toil through history: Lefty Stephanides's first job in the United States is at Ford Motor Company (as pictured in the 1920s). The Kirkus Reviews described Middlesex as a \\"virtuosic combination of elegy, sociohistorical study, and picaresque adventure\\", and Adam Begley in the New York Observer called it \\"a hybrid form, epic crossed with history, romance, comedy, tragedy.\\" Other reviews also categorized the book under various genres. Covering the lives of three generations of the Stephanides family, Middlesex is considered a family saga by novelist Geraldine Bedell. The book is more than a mere family saga, according to Samuel Cohen in his paper for Twentieth Century Literature; it depicts the Stephanides' trials and tribulations through historical events. Cohen is not convinced by Eugenides' declaration that Middlesex was not conceived as a historical novel; he said the novel satisfied much of the criterion for the genre. Cal, narrating his story in 2002, describes events from the early 1920s to the mid-1970s. According to Cohen, the difference in timeframes, at least 25 years apart, \\"establishes that the novel is set safely in the past\\". According to Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic, Cal's narration evokes the style of the picaresque novel, retelling events that have already occurred and foreshadowing the future through \\"portentous glimpses\\". Francisco Collado-Rodríguez, a professor of American literature, classified the beginning of Middlesex as a historiographical and metafictional chronicle for its discussion of events such as the Greco-Turkish war and the Great Fire of Smyrna. He also considered the first section of the novel as a tragicomedy about the Stephanides' migration from Greece and assimilation into America. Soar posited Desdemona and Lefty's passage as a romantic comedy: the lovers, brother and sister, pretend to be strangers who meet for the first time, attempting \\"to unknow themselves, to remythologise themselves by developing a past they could live with, unfamiliar and therefore permissible\\". As the story progresses, Middlesex becomes a social novel about Detroit, discussing the seclusion of living in a 1970s suburb. At the end of the novel, the story adopts the tone of the detective genre. The novel is characterized as a \\"dramatic\\" Bildungsroman with a \\"big twist\\" because the coming-of-age story is revealed to be the incorrect one: after being nurtured as a woman, Cal must instead learn to become a man. The book has \\"two distinct and occasionally warring halves\\". Whereas the first part is about hermaphrodites, the second is about Greeks. The latter half, \\"full of incest, violence, and terrible family secrets\\", was considered by Daniel Mendelsohn, an author and critic, to be more effective because Middlesex is largely about how Callie inherited the momentous gene that \\"ends up defining her indefinable life\\". Writing for The New Republic, James Wood classified Middlesex as a story written in the vein of hysterical realism. He said the novel is influenced by its own recounting of \\"excitements, patternings, and implausibilities that lie on the soft side of magical realism\\". Such moments in the book include how two cousins conceive \\"on the same night and at the same moment\\" and how years later, those children marry each other. Woods also pointed out the seeming coincidences that involved locales. Smyrna is the burning city from which she flees to start a new life; New Smyrna Beach is where she spends her retirement. Effectively serving as a double entendre, the title of the book refers to the name of the street where Cal stays at and describes his situation: a hermaphrodite brought up as a girl but who decides to become a boy. Cal's condition is also reflected in his choice of locale to narrate the novel: Berlin is a city formerly of \\"two halves or sexes\\" (East and West). Themes =Rebirth= Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona must start life anew. When she is 14 years old, Callie experiences a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States and becomes a midwife of her new life by teaching herself to forget what she has learned as a female. Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed and how it is administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister. =American Dream= Middlesex traces the trials and adversity faced by the Stephanides family as they pursue the American Dream. Beginning with Lefty and Desdemona, Cal's grandparents, fleeing from their homeland to Ellis Island and the United States, the novel later depicts the family living in a suburban vista at Grosse Pointe, Michigan. After they immigrate to the United States, Lefty and Desdemona find themselves in a blissful America on the brink of economic collapse. They dream about a perfect America where effort and morals will lead to good fortune. However, they must seek to attain this perfection during a period characterized by Prohibition and xenophobic anti- immigration legislation. Middlesex depicts the tribulations of attaining an identity, especially while dealing with the revelation that the American Dream is a delusion that has already disappeared. =Race relations= Middlesex portrays the race relations between people of different cultures; Mendelsohn considered the handling of this theme \\"preachy and nervous\\". In the United States, a strongly nativist country in the 1920s, Greek immigrants must suffer numerous humiliations at the hands of prejudiced whites. When Cal's grandfather Lefty, a recent Greek immigrant, is working at one of Henry Ford's automobile factories, Ford investigators attempt to Americanize him. They visit his house to ascertain that he has been living as a typical American. For example, during his first English-language lesson, Lefty is taught that \\"[e]mployees should use plenty of soap and water in the home\\". The narrow- minded nativists believe that immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe are unaware of the value of soap and water. According to scholar Robert Zecker, the novel depicts African-American poverty but does not illustrate its causes. None of the characters think about how 500,000 African-Americans were placed in cramped living areas of only 25 square blocks and the bitterness and rage that stems from such conditions. The African Americans do not forget the years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek Americans, like other whites, fail to remember that the African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are \\"inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere\\". The novel skims over the brutal attacks, lasting a week, on blacks in Detroit during World War II. Years later, in 1967, Lefty is incorrectly told that that year's Detroit riots were started by a black man raping a white woman; this falsehood is never rectified. However, despite this misinformation, Lefty denies service to a number of white customers who partook in the riots. One dismissed customer even yells at him, \\"[w]hy don't you go back to your own country?\\", returning the spotlight of racial prejudice on him. The relationship between the Greek Americans and the African Americans is fraught with prejudice. For example, during the Depression, Desdemona is shocked and humiliated that she will have to work in the Black Bottom, a predominantly black neighborhood. When African Americans are beaten or taken advantage of by whites, the characters in Middlesex \\"suddenly are nearsighted\\" to the racial prejudice. Despite being in the United States for only 10 years and having experienced racism herself, she can, Zecker noted, \\"recite at heart the slights at blacks as lazy, dirty, sexually promiscuous, and incapable of self-help.\\" She and other whites, including immigrant whites, feel rage because they are \\"convinced they were somehow forced out of Detroit following 1967.\\" While walking through the neighborhood, a group of African-American men loafing in front of a barbershop wolf-whistle to Desdemona and make lascivious comments, thus confirming the racial stereotype. Zecker remarked that in an ironic twist, immediately after the riots, Desdemona's family is shamed by a white realtor who \\"doubts their fitness (whiteness)\\" to live in the rich city Grosse Pointe. In the 1970s, African Americans, instead of Mediterraneans, were discriminated against through redlining. Zecker opined that by framing African Americans as the \\"eternal destroyers\\" and white ethnics as \\"yet again the oppressed innocents\\", Eugenides \\"captures perfectly the dominant narrative of urban decline in the early twenty-first century American Zeitgeist.\\" Insurance settlement from the damage caused at the riots allows the Stephanides to purchase a home away from the African Americans. The family participates in the white flight from the city to avoid the racial desegregation in the public schools, sending Cal to a private school. =Ethnic identity= When Lefty and Desdemona are forced to immigrate to the United States, they have different mindsets. Whereas Lefty embraces his new country's customs, Desdemona is adamant that she will follow her old country's ways. For example, she is angered that her \\"immigrant hair\\" is chopped off because she does not want to \\"look like an Amerikanidha\\" and decides to regrow her hair immediately. Lefty attempts to assimilate into American culture by zealously learning English. Lina, the cousin of Lefty and Desdemona, is the paragon of immigrant integration. Cal noted: \\"In the five years since leaving Turkey, Sourmelina had managed to erase just about everything identifiably Greek about her.\\" Cal's father, Milton, and his friends and family cherish their Sunday gatherings. They debate and tell stories to each other, attempting to regain their ethnic roots. A \\"contrarian\\", Milton enjoys debating Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and lamenting the steep cost of church candles. Eugenides repeatedly returns to the gathering prior to Cal's conception, to \\"manufacture a psychology that drives his narration\\". As the immigrants attempt to maintain their identity, the stage is set for Cal's writing even before he is conceived. Middlesex delves into the schism and reconciling of two opposites by contrasting the experiences and opinions of males and females; Greek Americans and White Anglo-Saxon Protestants; Greeks and Turks; and African Americans and White Americans. Critic Raoul Eshelman noted that despite these conflicts, the narrator is able to achieve \\"ethnic reconciliation\\" when he moves to Berlin and lives with the Turks, people who had murdered his forebears in the early 20th century and who had indirectly allowed his grandparents to consummate their incestuous relationship. Alkarim Jivani opined on BBC Television's current affairs broadcast Newsnight that \\"[o]nly a child of the Diaspora can do that, because we stand on the threshold of two rooms.\\" The novel also demonstrates that love and family are vital not only to people with unambiguous genders, but also hermaphrodites. The Greek immigrant family experiences a three-phase acculturation that occurs to immigrant families, according to scholar Merton Lee's research about sociologist George A. Kourvetaris' work. Each generation identifies with different nationalities and cultures. In the first generation, the family members classify themselves as having a Greek nationality. In the second generation, the children classify themselves with an American nationality and Greek Orthodox religion. In the third generation, the grandchildren, who comprise the most acculturated group, characterize themselves with \\"Greek-immigration status as a class\\". The Stephanides lineage is from Bithynios, a village in Asia Minor where the Greek middleman minority is inclined to be in uneasy relations with the Turkish majority. The people of the middleman minority do not assimilate because of their small mercantile businesses and because their host country is antagonistic towards them. Desdemona, a first-generation Greek immigrant, reflects a fixation with not assimilating. She tells her husband Lefty that she does not want to become an \\"Amerikanidha\\" and is frightened that her cousin Lina's husband, Jimmy Zizmo, is a Pontian Greek. Desdemona considers Pontians to be adulterated Greeks because Pontians inhabited Turkey, where some became Muslims and did not follow the Greek Orthodox religion. Daniel Soar opined that Olympus, a parallel to Bithynios, served well as the starting point of a debacle (the eventual birth of an intersex person) that is the \\"story's catalyst\\". In Mount Olympus during Justinian's days, silkworm eggs were contraband transported from China to Byzantium by missionaries. A parallel is drawn when Desdemona, a raiser of silk cocoons, attempts to bring them to Detroit. Because the silkworm eggs are considered parasites by the immigration officials, Desdemona must dispose of them. Soar noted that \\"for the three generations of Greek Americans who people Middlesex, the mulberry trees of Mount Olympus are an appropriately antique beginning: they are the egg inside which everything began\\". =Greek mythical allusions= Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry, is the namesake of Eugenides' protagonist. Middlesex has several allusions to Greek classical myths; for example, the protagonist is named after Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figure--Tiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived seven years as a woman because of a curse. Eugenides and several critics compared Cal's condition to mythical creatures described by the ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all of them at the same time. In her book column for the Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's identity crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In a manner similar to Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies from one generation to the next. =Nature versus nurture= The novel examines the nature versus nurture debate in detail. At the beginning of the novel, Cal writes, \\"Sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation on my fifth chromosome.\\" He then apologizes, saying, \\"Sorry if I get a little Homeric at times. That's genetic, too.\\" This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, \\"If you were going to devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn't come up with anything better than my life.\\" Callie inherited the mutation for a gene that causes 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which impedes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. While the former hormone causes the brain to become masculine, it is the latter that molds male genitals. When Callie reaches puberty, her testosterone levels increase significantly, resulting in the formation of a larger Adam's apple, the broadening of her muscles, the deepening of her voice, and the augmentation of her clitoris to resemble a penis. Doctors determine that Callie has the XY chromosomes of a male after inspecting Callie's genitalia. Callie's parents bring her to New York City to see Dr. Peter Luce, a foremost expert on hermaphroditism, who believes she should retain her female identity. Luce plans a gender reassignment surgery to make her a female. However, Callie knows that she is sexually attracted to females, and decides to run away to pursue a male identity. When Cal has a sexual relationship with the Japanese- American photographer Julie at the end of the book, he is able to love \\"without the need to penetrate the object of his desire\\". Mark Lawson of The Guardian noted that the cause of Cal's hermaphroditic condition is an inherited recessive gene. According to UC Riverside psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky, the novel examines how an individual's traits are due neither solely to nature nor solely to nurture. Similarly, Cal's gender cannot be defined solely as male or female. Rather, it is both male and female. Addressing how genetic determinism may have renewed the antediluvian beliefs about destiny, Eugenides refutes the post-Freudian beliefs that a person's traits are mainly due to nurture. Thus, the novel pits evolutionary biology against free will. Eugenides sought to find a compromise between these two views. Explaining that gender is a \\"very American concept\\", he believes that \\"humans are freer than we realize. Less genetically encumbered.\\" =Gender identity and intersex status= Raised as a girl, Cal views himself as a girl who likes other girls. His ability to have a \\"feminine gender schema\\" despite his having male genes, substantiates the constructionist position that gender identity is fully dependent on outer influences. However, when Callie discovers that he could have been raised as a boy, he renounces his female gender, recognizing his chosen gender identity as a male. Disowning the female gender before he learned about masculine traits bolsters the argument for the \\"essentialist ideology of identity\\". Cal's embrace of his inherent male identity and renunciation of his childhood female gender identity is articulated when he reflects, \\"I never felt out of place being a girl, I still don't feel entirely at home among men.\\" Cal exhibits many masculine characteristics when he is a child. He writes, \\"I began to exude some kind of masculinity, in the way I tossed up and caught my eraser, for instance.\\" In another incident, Cal discusses how his penchants were masculine. While his female classmates are turned off by the blood in the Iliad, Cal is \\"thrilled to [read about] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations.\\" Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, \\"Did I see through the male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls see through the tricks, too, and just pretend not to notice?\\" Cal also exhibits feminine characteristics, which allows Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother gives him a doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages. Determining sex is paradoxical because the characters believe that the outward view of genitalia identifies one's sex; Cal's transformation into a male shatters this belief and the methodology behind determining gender. Eugenides addresses how difficult it was for humans to devise a \\"universal classification for sex\\". Through Cal, scholar Angela Pattatucci Aragon stated, Eugenides opines that the 1876 system devised by Edwin Klebs that used gonad tissue to determine sex provides the most accurate answer. According to intersex activist and academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person's sexual attraction determines his or her gender. Cal's wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link between gender identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie \\"denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality.\\" Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees with the belief that being attracted to females is \\"masculine\\" and thus it is \\"more natural\\" for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Review of Books argued that Callie does not have to be a male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, \\"Breasts have the same effect on me as on anyone with my testosterone level.\\" Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish \\"Eugenides's (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership\\". Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie's erotic interest in girls is \\"retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his 'true biological nature'.\\" Cal's gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal's inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth. When Callie is in New York, she goes to the New York Public Library and searches for the meaning of the word \\"hermaphrodite\\"; she is shocked when the dictionary entry concludes with \\"See synonyms at MONSTER\\". Callie is not a Frankenstein; she is more like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Bartkowski stated that Eugenides' message is \\"we must let our monsters out—they demand and deserve recognition—they are us: our same, self, others.\\" Morgan Holmes, formerly of ISNA, describes how the book constructs an intersex character whose life reproduces \\"social fascination with the monstrous and the deviant.\\"Book review: Intersex by Morgan Holmes, Robert Teixeira in Daily Xtra, October 25, 2009. Seven Graham wrote in Ariel, a journal published by the University of Calgary, that Eugenides' \\"persisen[t]\\" use of the word \\"hermaphrodite\\", instead of \\"intersex\\", alludes to Hermaphroditus. Hermaphroditus, a young man, is chased by the nymph Salmacis. She begs the Gods to bind her and Hermaphroditus together, and the Gods literally fulfill her wish. Hermaphroditus' name is a compound of his parent's names—Hermes and Aphrodite. He instantaneously turns into someone of both sexes. Devastated because he is no longer fully male, he \\"curses\\" the location where he first met Salmacis. Graham stated that the use of \\"hermaphrodite\\" carries negative connotations: > Based on this origin story, the hermaphrodite's lot is miserable, associated > with disempowerment, the theft of identity and an unhappy dual existence. In > addition, the term \\"hermaphrodite\\" may be deemed problematic because it > alludes to an impossible state of being: no-one can be equally male and > female and the preferred term \\"intersex\\" indicates a blended rather than > divided state. While the modern term might indicate the possibility of > redefining sexual ambivalence, Cal is associated in the novel with the > mythic term and all it connotes. His connection to this tragic figure is > confirmed by his performance as \\"Hermaphroditus\\" in a sex show at the age of > fourteen, just as he is beginning his female to male transition. Writing that he belongs to the Intersex Society of America, Cal notes that he has not participated in any of the group's rallies because he is not a \\"political person\\". While discussing political activism, Cal uses the word \\"intersex\\", though in other parts of the novel, he uses the word \\"hermaphrodite\\". In the 1920s, Bernice L. Hausman described \\"intersexuality\\" as a \\"continuum of physiological and anatomical sex differences\\", contesting the notion of a \\"true sex\\" concealed in the tissues of the body. Though \\"hermaphrodite\\" is burdened by the implications of the anomaly, \\"intersexuality\\" is a neologism that tries to \\"naturalize various sexes, which themselves are naturally occurring.\\" Because Cal uses \\"hermaphrodite\\", he indicates that the sole normal genders are the classifications of male and female. Eugenides was asked by an Oprah's Book Club member why he used the term \\"hermaphrodite\\" despite its usage being \\"either terribly ignorant or unforgivably callous\\". Eugenides replied that he reserved \\"hermaphrodite\\" for a literary character: Hermaphroditus. He further stated: \\"When speaking about real people, I should—and I do my best to—use the term 'intersex'.\\" Noting that one of the initial sources he consulted was the journal Hermaphrodites with Attitude published by the Intersex Society of North America, he said that those writers have \\"co-opted\\" the term \\"hermaphrodite\\". Their action is reminiscent, Eugenides wrote, of how some members of the gay community have \\"reclaimed\\" the term \\"queer\\". Eugenides stated that it is no surprise that Cal uses \\"hermaphrodite\\" and further elaborated: \\"It's paradoxical: Cal can say 'hermaphodite' but I can't. Or shouldn't.\\" =Incest and intersex= Incest and intersex is another theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived during the same night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference was a factor in his being intersex. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, Chapter Eleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial. Thea Hillman, an intersex activist and board member for the (now defunct) Intersex Society of North America (ISNA), wrote in the Lambda Book Report, 2002, that the combination of incest and intersex is \\"inaccurate and misleading\\". Noting that incest is a loathed social taboo that has \\"shameful, pathological and criminal repercussions\\", she criticized Eugenides for underscoring that Cal's intersex condition is due to incest. Hillman stated that this adds to the fallacious belief that intersex people are \\"shameful and sick\\" and a danger to society's wellbeing. Seven Graham agrees with Hillman and Holmes, writing that Cal is paralleled with the tragic Greek mythological characters Hermaphroditus, Tiresias, and the Minotaur. They opined that other \\"deviant\\" characters in the novel such as Lefty and Desdemona are spared the \\"tragic or monstrous\\" allusions even though there are numerous examples of incest in Greek mythology. They listed the marriage of Oedipus and his mother Jocasta, as well as the son Adonis produced by the incest between Theias and his daughter Smyrna as examples. Therefore, Graham stated that comparing Cal, an intersex person, to people who were \\"mythological monsters\\" is \\"complicit with [the] exploitation\\" of intersex people. Reception =Honors and adaptation= Lee Bollinger awards the 2003 Pulitzer Prize to Jeffrey Eugenides on May 30, 2003. In 2003, Middlesex was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Pulitzer Board wrote in their report that Middlesex is a \\"vastly realized, multi-generational novel as highspirited as it is intelligent . . . Like the masks of Greek drama, Middlesex is equal parts comedy and tragedy, but its real triumph is its emotional abundance, delivered with consummate authority and grace.\\" Eugenides was attending the Prague Writers' Festival when Middlesex won the Pulitzer Prize. When a young Associated Press photographer notified him about winning the award, Eugenides was dubious, noting that \\"[i]t seemed very unlikely that he would be the messenger of such news.\\" At the time, Eugenides was with the Canadian author Yann Martel who confirmed the photographer's words after checking on the hotel's computer. A waiter brought champagne to Eugenides, and Greek women started kissing him. When journalists called Eugenides, he declined to take their calls, saying in an interview later that he wanted to \\"celebrate the moment instead of leaping immediately into the media maelstrom.\\" Author David Gates was a member of the 2003 Pulitzer Board triumvirate. The novel received the Ambassador Book Award, Spain's Santiago de Compostela Literary Prize, and the Great Lakes Book Award. In 2003, it was a finalist in the fictional category of the National Book Critics Circle Award. Middlesex was also a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award, which is given to LGBT literature. In 2003, the novel was shortlisted for but did not win the International Dublin Literary Award. Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review considered Middlesex to be one of the best books in 2002. In 2007, Oprah Winfrey chose Middlesex to be discussed in her book club. Eugenides was a guest on Oprah's show with several intersex individuals who told stories about their lives. In 2011, Eugenides was interviewed by University College London English professor John Mullan in The Guardian Book Club. The audiobook version of Middlesex was released by Macmillan Audio in September 2002\\\\. Read by Kristoffer Tabori, the audiobook has 28 sides, each side having a unique style of introductory music that complements the atmosphere and plot of the saga. In 2003, the audiobook received an Audie Award in the \\"unabridged fiction\\" category. =Critical reception= Some critics were dissatisfied with the scope of the novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected stories to tell. Caly Risen of Flak Magazine believed that the immigrant experience was the \\"heart of the novel\\", lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a \\"fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further.\\" Risen wished to read more about the events between Cal's adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal's experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. The Washington Posts Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic also felt that the brief description of Callie's childhood was lacking; the book \\"gloss[es] over\\" how her mother did not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O'Nan characterized Cal's relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as \\"underdeveloped\\", causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of People had the same view about the novel's end, writing that the conclusion felt \\"rushed\\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called the novel a \\"big-hearted, restless story\\" and rated it an A minus. Lisa Zeidner of The Washington Post opined that Middlesex \\"provides not only incest à la Ada and a Lolita-style road trip, but enough dense detail to keep fans of close reading manically busy.\\" Tami Hoag of People concurred, writing that \\"this feast of a novel is thrilling in the scope of its imagination and surprising in its tenderness\\". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon agreed, praising Middlesex as an \\"epic and wondrous\\" novel filled with numerous characters and historical occurrences. Mendelsohn praised Middlesex for its \\"dense narrative, interwoven with sardonic, fashionably postmodern commentary.\\" However, he criticized the novel as a disjointed hybrid. He wrote Eugenides was successful with the story of the Greek immigrants, which he described as \\"authenti[c]\\", but mishandled the hermaphrodite material, which Mendelsohn characterized as \\"unpersuasiv[e]\\". The Economist review stated that a more concise, concentrated depiction of hermaphroditism would have made the book more \\"fun to read\\". Jeff Zaleski of Publishers Weekly praised Eugenides' portrayal of the girl, Callie, and the man Cal. Zaleski wrote that \\"[i]t's difficult to imagine any serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender.\\" Paul Quinn of Contemporary Literary Criticism commended the novel, writing: \\"That Eugenides manages to move us without sinking into sentiment shows how successfully he has avoided the tentacles of irony which grip so many writers of his generation.\\" Christina McCarroll of The Christian Science Monitor wrote that \\"Eugenides wrangles with a destiny that mutates and recombines like restless chromosomes, in a novel of extraordinary flexibility, scope, and emotional depth.\\" Marta Salij of the Detroit Free Press was impressed with the book's depiction of Detroit, writing \\"[a]t last Detroit has its novel. What Dublin got from James Joyce—a sprawling, ambitious, loving, exasperated and playful chronicle of all its good and bad parts—Detroit has from native son Eugenides in these 500 pages.\\" David Kipen of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed, opining \\"[a]mong so many other things, this praiseworthy, prize-worthy yarn succeeds as a heartbroken mash note to the Detroit of Eugenides' birth, a city whose neighborhoods he sometimes appears to love—as he loves his characters—less for their virtues than for their defects. Any book that can make a reader actively want to visit Detroit must have one honey of a tiger in its tank.\\" Several critics have nominated the book for the title of \\"Great American Novel\\". Tim Morris, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, wrote that the novel was \\"the latest in a long line of contenders for the status of Great American Novel\\", and compared Cal to Huckleberry Finn, the narrator of Invisible Man, and J. Sutter in John Henry Days. Alexander Linklater of the Evening Standard commented that American publishers chose Middlesex as the next Great American Novel to generate progress for American fiction and that Eugenides is considered the \\"next stepping stone along from Jonathan Franzen\\". Dan Cryer of Newsday wrote that with the publication of Middlesex, \\"[f]inally, Detroit has its very own great American novel\\". David Gates of Newsweek contrasted Eugenides' debut novel The Virgin Suicides with Middlesex, writing that the first novel was \\"ingenious\\", \\"entertaining\\", and \\"oddly moving\\", but that Middlesex is \\"ingenious\\", \\"entertaining\\", and \\"ultimately not-so-moving\\". Despite this criticism, Gates considered Middlesex to be the novel where Eugenides \\"finally plays his metafictional ace\\". Commenting that Middlesex is \\"more discursive and funnier\\" than The Virgin Suicides, Laura Miller of Salon wrote that the two novels deal with disunity. Max Watman of The New Criterion concurred, noting that Middlesex is \\"funny, big, embracing, and wonderful\\", unlike Eugenides' first novel. Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised Middlesex for having the same unique qualities as The Virgin Suicides, commenting that Middlesex had \\"an ability to describe the horrible in a comic voice, an unusual form of narration and an eye for bizarre detail.\\" Lawson noted that whereas Middlesex deals with the \\"links\\" among gender, life, and genes, The Virgin Suicides deals with the \\"connections\\" between gender and death. According to Olivia Banner of Signs, medical journals generally had positive reviews of the novel for its depiction of the inner lives of intersex people. Writing in Archives of Disease in Childhood, Simon Fountain-Polley praised the novel, writing: \\"All clinicians, and families who have faced gender crises or difficult life-changing decision[s] on identity should read this book; delve into an emotional trip of discovery—where the slightest direction change could lead to myriad different lives.\\" Abraham Bergman wrote in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine: \\"Yes, it is fiction, but I cannot imagine a more authentic and sensitive voice. Because our interactions usually take place in limited and structured setting such as offices and hospitals, pediatricians have scant opportunity to learn how our young patients think. One way to sharpen our awareness is to listen to children's voices as they are expressed in books. In Middlesex, the voice is loud and clear.\\" Banner noted that most of the reviews in intersex and queer publications praised Middlesex. She posited that the problematic issues of a \\"heteromasculine-identified narrator\\" and the \\"fact that it was authored by a heterosexual man\\" may have been outweighed by the necessity for an appropriate reading that \\"destigmatizes ambiguous sex\\". Eugenides' third novel, The Marriage Plot, was published in 2011. Reviewer William Deresiewicz contrasted The Marriage Plot and Middlesex, writing that the former was \\"far more intimate in tone and scale\\". The Marriage Plot follows two years in the lives of three characters, fourth-year Brown University students in 1982, whereas Middlesex follows the lives of three generations of characters. Deresiewicz preferred the 2011 novel, writing that \\"[t]he books are far apart in quality\\". He criticized Middlesex for its \\"[c]lanking prose, clunky exposition, transparent devices, telegraphed moves\\", \\"a hash of narrative contrivances with very little on its mind.\\" On a more positive note, Deresiewicz lauded Eugenides' colorful depiction of \\"young love\\" across his three novels. In The Virgin Suicides, Eugenides resplendently portrayed the intense fear during virginal sex, as well as Gabriel García Márquez, the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate; in Middlesex, the single event in which the novel \\"comes to life\\" is Eugenides' depiction of Callie's liaison with her adolescent lover; and in The Marriage Plot, the novel was exceptional in its \\"sweet banter of courtship\\" and the \\"doormat nice-boy role\\" the character Mitchell assumes in his interplay with his darling, Madeleine. =Sales= From the book's publication until the early months of 2003, its sales were unsatisfactory, according to Bill Goldstein of The New York Times. In the week following April 7, 2003, the day Middlesex won the Pulitzer Prize, the book sold 2,700 copies. The book later made the best-selling fiction list and kept its position for five weeks. In June 2007, the novel ranked seventh on USA Todays Best-Selling Books list. In the same month, after Eugenides appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the novel, Middlesex placed second on The New York Times best-selling paperback fiction list. The Pulitzer award nearly propelled Middlesex to The New York Times Best Seller list, which in 2003 published only the top 15 bestsellers; in the week after Middlesex was announced the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the novel placed 17th on the \\"expanded list\\". In 2007, 1.3 million copies of the book had been sold. The same year, the book placed ninth on the Library Journal bestsellers list, which ranks \\"the books most borrowed in U.S. libraries\\". Over three million copies of Middlesex had been sold by May 2011 and over four million by 2013.

It was released in Japan in March 2004, and in North America in September 2004. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory and was developed for less than 1 million. In designing Katamari Damacy, the development team led by Keita Takahashi aimed to maintain three key points: novelty, ease of understanding and enjoyment. The game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the stars, constellations, and Moon, which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. Katamari Damacy story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production. Overall, Katamari Damacy was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a sleeper hit and won several awards. The success of the game led to the creation of the Katamari franchise, and inspired the development of other video games. Some critics have called it one of the greatest games of all time. A high-definition remaster of the game, Katamari Damacy Reroll, was released on Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch in December 2018, and is scheduled to release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2020. Synopsis In a drunken stupor, an eccentric, god-like entity called the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars, Earth's Moon and other such celestial bodies in the universe, save for Earth itself. Despite acknowledging his mistake, the King charges his 5-centimeter-tall son, the Prince, to go to Earth with a \\"katamari\\"—a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow—and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and the Moon. The Prince is successful, and the universe is returned to normal. A side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks. The father, an astronaut, is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, \\"senses\\" the Prince's work—she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky. Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon. Gameplay The \\"Make A Star\\" mode in Katamari Damacy is the primary mode, where the player must grow the katamari to a specific size (diameter) in a limited amount of time. The player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos. The player uses the two analog sticks on the DualShock controller in a manner similar to the classic arcade game Battlezone to control the direction the katamari rolls. Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more. Objects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari. This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds. The typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the \\"Make a Star\\" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear). The player can attempt a score attack mode for any level, in which they try to make the largest katamari possible in the time allotted. Certain levels can unlock an \\"eternal mode\\" by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit. Each level features two secret items that can be found. The first item is a royal present that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots. The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game. In the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins. The screen is split vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari. Development Takahashi in 2005, with a plush version of the Prince from the game Keita Takahashi had studied art and entered the Musashino Art University to study sculpting in 1995. During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium. Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called Action Drive, inspired by Crazy Taxi but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to Katamari Damacy: the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince's head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then \\"drive\\" the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. Action Drive was eventually cancelled. While working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of Katamari Damacy. The first was a prototype shown by Sony Computer Entertainment called Densen (Japanese for \\"power line\\") that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi the idea that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of tamakorogashi played in Japanese school's undōkai or sports days. In tamakorogashi, students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal. Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary stuff into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game. However, as Takahashi was in Namco's art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco's superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that Konami had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games & Music Division (later, Bemani) that were highly successful, including Beatmania, GuitarFreaks, and Dance Dance Revolution. Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, Masaya Nakamura was principal of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world. Takahashi took Ozaki's advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco's arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco. One initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the PlayStation 2. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the Emotion Engine. However, Sony had not provided any updated software development kits, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware. As a result, the console was difficult to develop for at its launch. In contrast, Nintendo had recently announced the GameCube and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to the previous Nintendo 64 console. Thus, Takahashi's team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release. In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped. The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year's Japan Media Arts Festival for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game's full development. Full work on Katamari Damacy began in late 2001. Namco assigned Now Production, based in Osaka, to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned that having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about (about at the time of production) for the game; this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco's blockbuster titles such as Ridge Racer or Soulcalibur. The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version. Takahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor. Iwatani compared the game to Namco's Pac-Man, which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company. At one point during development, Takahashi \\"proactively ignored\\" advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game. The core gameplay of Katamari Damacy is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, \\"Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program\\". The patent, issued in 2009, primarily describes how the game maintains the roughly spherical nature of the katamari when objects are picked up, though extends to concepts such as tracking objects collected based on temperature or weight values, which were modes included with later games of the series. =Music= The music in Katamari Damacy was widely hailed as imaginative and original (winning both IGN's and GameSpot's \\"Soundtrack of the Year 2004\\" awards) and was considered one of the game's best features. The soundtrack was released in Japan as Katamari Fortissimo Damacy. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences (Shibuya-kei). Most of the tracks were composed by Yuu Miyake, and many feature vocals from popular J-pop singers, such as Yui Asaka from the Sukeban Deka 3 TV series, and anime voice actors, including Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. One track is sung and written by Charlie Kosei, composer of the Lupin III soundtrack. Release A single-level demonstration of the final version of Katamari Damacy was exhibited at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show (TGS). The demo was critically praised by the press, with GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann describing it as a \\"good dose of weird fun\\". Sony expressed strong interest in pushing the game's release forward based on the TGS response, offering to handle the game's promotion in exchange. Sony advertised the game on numerous billboards and posters across Japan, and created an infamous television ad of a businessman, waiting for an appointment, rolling up office furniture and staff. The original prototype game's cover artwork featured the large red ball used in tamakorogashi, but for the game's final release, Takahashi developed the game's cover art, showing a large katamari on the verge of rolling over a city, emphasizing the scale of the game. The game was released in Japan on March 18, 2004, priced at about , roughly two-thirds of the cost of most major titles at the time. Namco had estimated that the game would sell over 500,000 units in Japan during its first year, and while the game did not make that metric, it had stayed as one of the top ten games sold in Japan through its first nine weeks on the market, with more than 100,000 units sold during that period, which was considered impressive for a new intellectual property. The public reaction to the game was positive enough that Namco ordered a sequel by December 2004. At this point, Namco had not considered any Western release for the game. Katamari Damacy was first shown in the United States at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 Game Developers Conference. A group of Western developers from the International Game Developers Association had previously brought Mojib-Ribbon to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering Katamari Damacy as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as \\"electric\\", but they were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release. Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called \\"Namco's snowball simulator\\", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at E3 2004. Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release. By July 2004, Namco officially announced the game's release in North America for September 2004. The game was never officially released in Europe, though its subsequent sequels would receive European releases. In the Japanese language, means \\"clump\\" or \\"clod\\" and Damashii is the rendaku form of which means \\"soul\\" or \\"spirit\\". Therefore, the phrase approximates to \\"clump spirit\\". The two kanji that form the name look similar (sharing the same right-side element 鬼), in a kind of visual alliteration. The name is officially transliterated as Katamari Damacy in most releases. Game creator Keita Takahashi said that the title suddenly popped into his head from the start and never changed during development. Reception Katamari Damacy enjoyed moderate success in Japan. The game was sold at about two-thirds of the price of a new game at the time. It was the top selling game the week of its release with 32,000 units sold, and sold over 155,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2004. However, Namco originally estimated that over 500,000 units would be sold in Japan. The game was not released in PAL territories such as Europe and Australia since publishers thought it was too \\"quirky\\" for these markets; however, Electronic Arts picked up both sequels, We Love Katamari and Me & My Katamari, for release in Europe. The North American release of the game was very well received by professional reviewers, was mentioned and praised on TechTV, and was a featured sidebar in the May 23, 2004, edition of Time magazine. Time continued to praise the game in its November 22, 2004 \\"Best games of the year\\" special, calling it \\"the most unusual and original game to hit PlayStation2\\". Most retailers underestimated the demand for such a quirky game, and only purchased a few copies of this sleeper hit; it rapidly sold out nationwide, with sales surpassing 120,000 units in North America. It also won the U.S. award for \\"Excellence in Game Design\\" at the 2005 Game Developers Choice Awards, and G4 awarded Katamari Damacy its \\"Best Innovation\\" prize in its G-Phoria of that year. Katamari Damacy was one of the recipients of the 2004 Good Design Award in Japan, the first time a video game has won this award. Katamari Damacy won two awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences for \\"Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\\", as well as nominations for \\"Game of the Year\\", \\"Console Game of the Year\\", and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\\". In 2015, the game placed 13th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. In 2019, it was ranked 49th on The Guardian newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list. Although the game has rapidly achieved a cult following and has been praised by many reviewers, it also has its share of criticism. A common complaint is that the game is relatively short and repetitive—it can be completed in under ten hours, and the gameplay stays virtually the same all the way through. However, others, such as Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Mark McDonald (who gave the game 8.5 out of ten with his EGM staff), argue that the game's limitations are made up for by its strengths: \\"Sure, you're basically doing the same thing each mission, but Katamari's elegant controls, killer soundtrack, and wicked humor make it perfectly suited for replay.\\" As a well-executed, non- traditional game, Katamari Damacy has been influential in the game development community. Since its release, a number of designers have developed works inspired by Katamari: one example is The Wonderful End of the World. Legacy Katamari Damacy has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles. The game's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, We Love Katamari, was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is self-referential, following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, We Love Katamari introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels. On July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art, entitled \\"Century of the Child: Growing by Design\\". Here, the game was used to demonstrate the change in toys and \\"playthings\\" over the 20th century, specifically praising the game for its \\"quirky manipulations of scale\\" that makes it accessible for all ages. Vice president of marketing for Namco Bandai Games America, Inc. Carlson Choi described the inclusion of Katamari Damacy to the exhibit as \\"a testament to the creative designs embodied in Namco Bandai's games ... in addition to being a validation of video games as a modern form of interactive art.\\" On November 29 the same year, the game was included in the permanent collection of video games of the Museum of Modern Art. Curator Paola Antonelli selected Katamari Damacy among the first fourteen games to be displayed in the museum, which was chosen according to a variety of criteria, including \\"visual quality, elegance of the code and design of playing behavior.\\" A high-definition remaster of the game made with the Unity game engine, titled Katamari Damacy Reroll, was released on the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows on December 7, 2018. The game includes support for the Switch's gyro controls in addition to its traditional control scheme. Reroll was nominated for the Freedom Tower Award for Best Remake at the 2020 New York Game Awards. A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version is scheduled to release in Japan on November 19, and in worldwide on November 20, 2020. In a retrospective in 2019, Edge noted that playing the game 15 years after its initial release reveals how influential the game has been for independent games following it, and added that \\"Takahashi's breakout game shot through with what we think of these days as the indie spirit: it is playful and tremendously funny, deeply weird and a game with real heart.\\" Notes References External links * Category:2004 video games Category:Interactive Achievement Award winners Category:Katamari Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Namco games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Now Production games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Split-screen multiplayer games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Katamari Damacy"},{"id":"889118","text":"Sněžka or Śnieżka (in Czech and Polish respectively, Schneekoppe in German) is a mountain on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland, the most prominent point of the Silesian Ridge in the Krkonoše mountains. At , its summit is the highest point in the Czech Republic, in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in the Krkonoše and in the entire Sudetes.  History  Sněžka in 1900 Sněžka was one of the first European mountains visited by many tourists. This was mainly due to the relatively minor technical difficulties of the ascent and the fact that since the sixteenth century, many resort visitors flocked to the nearby Cieplice Śląskie-Zdrój and the highly visible Sněžka, visually dominant over all Krkonoše was for them an important attraction. The first historical account of an ascent to the peak is in 1456, by an unknown Venetian merchant searching for precious stones. The first settlements on the mountain soon appeared, being primarily mining communities, tapping into its deposits of copper, iron and arsenic. The mining shafts, totalling in length, remain to this day. The first recorded German name was Riseberg (\\"giant mountain\\", cf. Riesengebirge, \\"Giant Mountains\\"), mentioned by Georg Agricola in 1546. Fifteen years later the name Riesenberg appears on Martin Helwig's map of Silesia. The German name later changed to Riesenkoppe (\\"giant top\\") and finally to Schneekoppe (\\"snow top\\", \\"snowy head\\").the highest ridge in the 'Giant Mountains' rises to a height of 1,603.30 metres at the peak of 'Snowy Head', p.39 in Norman Davies, Roger Moorhouse: Microcosm: Portrait of a Central European City, Jonathan Cape, 2002 , 585 pages In Czech, the mountain was initially called Pahrbek Sněžný (\\"snow hill\\"); later Sněžka, with the eventual name Sněžovka, meaning \\"snowy\\" or \\"snow-covered\\", which was adopted in 1823. An older Polish name for the mountain was Góra Olbrzymia, meaning \\"giant mountain\\".Geographische Namen in den Böhmischen Ländern – see entry Sněžka The first building on the mountaintop was the Chapel of Saint Lawrence (Laurentiuskapelle), built ca. 1665–1681 by the Silesian noble Schaffgotsch family to mark their dominion, serving also as an inn for a brief period of time. The territory including the mines were the property of the Schaffgotsch family until 1945. The so-called Prussian hut (Preußische Baude) was built on the Silesian (now Polish) side in 1850, followed by the Bohemian hut (Česká bouda) on the Bohemian (now Czech) side in 1868, both built with the purpose of providing lodging. The Prussian hut was rebuilt twice after fires (1857 and 1862), and the (after 1945) \\"Polish hut\\" was finally demolished in 1967. The Bohemian hut fell into disrepair after 1990 and was demolished in 2004. A wooden weather station was built on the mountaintop ca. 1900, being the only weather station in Central Europe remaining intact after World War II. It was demolished in the 1980s. View from the summit of Sněžka  Today  The Polish meteo observatory, 2006. One side of the mountain is in the Czech Republic; the other belongs to Poland. The area is very popular in summer with tourists from the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany, who enjoy hiking in the alpine environment unique to this area. On the Polish side a disc-shaped observatory with a weather station and restaurant was built in 1974, and the St. Lawrence Chapel. On the Czech side are a post office, and a chairlift station, connecting the peak with the town of Pec pod Sněžkou at the base of the mountain. Although the mountain is the highest natural peak in the Czech Republic, the actual highest point is the top of the television transmitter on Praděd, reaching 1,652 metres (1,491+162 m). If the Polish observatory is taken into account, Sněžka peaks at 1,620 metres. In 2004 a new post office and observation platform replaced an old post office and the remains of the Bohemian hut, which had been closed since the 1980s. In March 2009 the Polish observatory suffered serious damage to the upper disc as a result of extreme weather and structural failure. The upper disc's floor broke, though a fast response from the Technical University of Wrocław saved the remaining disc from taking any further damage. The restaurant and meteo offices were reopened soon after the construction team had finished clearing the debris and securing what was left of the observatory. After detailed inspection it was determined that no further damage should occur and the building was restored to its previous state. The upper disc was restored to its 1974 design (with contemporary improvements), skipping certain \\"improvements\\" made in 1980s and 1990s which were suspected to contribute to the structural failure of March 2009. The old chairlift to the top of Sněžka was replaced by a new cable car system. Since February 2014, the four-person cabins in two sections have carried 250 visitors per hour from the Czech city Pec pod Sněžkou.New cable car on Sněžka, Giant Mountains, Czech Republic Retrieved 2014-09-14' There are many marked tourist routes from the Polish side to the summit, mainly from the city of Karpacz. It is possible to take a chairlift from Karpacz to Kopa (1377 m a.s.l.) which significantly shortens the way to the summit. Śnieżka belongs to the Crown of Europe, Crown of Polish Mountains and Crown of Sudetes.  Climate  Due to high altitude the climate is maritime polar (Köppen: ET) not far from a continental subpolar climate (Dfc). The difference should be at least 6 °C lower on annual average compared to the weather station in the plains.

A bouncer's duties are to provide security, to check legal age and drinking age, to refuse entry for intoxicated persons, and to deal with aggressive behavior or non-compliance with statutory or establishment rules. They are civilians and they are often hired directly by the venue, rather than by a security firm. Bouncers are often required where crowd size, clientele or alcohol consumption may make arguments or fights a possibility, or where the threat or presence of criminal gang activity or violence is high. In the United States, civil liability and court costs related to the use of force by bouncers are \\"the highest preventable loss found within the [bar] industry\\", as many United States bouncers are often taken to court and other countries have similar problems of excessive force. In many countries, federal or state governments have taken steps to professionalise the industry by requiring bouncers to have training, licensing, and a criminal records background check. Terminology Other terms include \\"cooler\\" (in the US and UK) and \\"door supervisor\\" in the UK.Get Licensed – SIA licensing criteria (from the Security Industry Authority, Great Britain. Accessed 2 May 2008.) In a US bar, the \\"cooler\\" is the head of a team of bouncers. In the UK, the terms \\"floor man\\", \\"floor person\\" or \\"cooler\\" may all be used for the bouncer role. The \\"cooler\\" is expected to have the same ability to respond to physical situations as the rest of the bouncers, but should also have reliable interpersonal skills that can be used to de-escalate situations without violence. History In the 1990s and 2000s, increased awareness of the risks of lawsuits and criminal charges have led many bars and venues to train their bouncers to use communication and conflict resolution skills before, or rather than, resorting to brute force against troublemakers. However, the earlier history of the occupation suggests that the stereotype of bouncers as rough, tough, physical enforcers has indeed been the case in many countries and cultures throughout history. Historical references also suggest that the 'doorman' function of guarding a place and selecting who can have entry to it (the stereotypical task of the modern bouncer) could at times be an honorific and evolve into a relatively important position. =Ancient= The significance of the doorman as the person allowing (or barring) entry is found in a number of Mesopotamian myths (and later in Greek myths descended from them), including that of Nergal overcoming the seven doormen guarding the gates to the Underworld. In 1 Chronicles 26 of the Old Testament, the Levitical Temple is described as having a number of 'gatekeepers'—amongst their duties are \\"protect[ing] the temple from theft\\", from \\"illegal entry into sacred areas\\" and \\"maintain[ing] order\\", all functions they share with the modern concept of the bouncer, though the described temple servants also serve as holy persons and administrators themselves (it is noted that some administrative function is still present in today's bouncing in the higher position of the supervisor). Doormen or bouncers are usually larger persons who display great strength and size. The Romans had a position known as the ostiarius (doorkeeper), initially a slave, who guarded the door, and sometimes ejected unwanted people from the house whose gate he guarded. The term later become a low-ranking clergy title. Plautus, in his play Bacchides (written approximately 194–184 BC), mentions a \\"large and powerful\\" doorman / bouncer as a threat to get an unwelcome visitor to leave. Tertullian, an early Christian author living mainly in the 1st century AD, while reporting on the casual oppression of Christians in Carthage, noted that bouncers were counted as part of a semi-legal underworld, amongst other 'shady' characters such as gamblers and pimps.De Fuga in Persecutione – Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus, via The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume XI, Second Edition, Page 393, Cambridge University Press, 1970 Within Buddhist lore, the Nio, the twin guardian statues who decorate the entrances of temples, dojos, and various places related with religious importance, are believed to be the embodiment of wrathful deity bodhisattvas such as Vajrapani, Mahasthamaprapta, Vajrasattva, Acala, or various figures within Buddhist legend who accompanied Gautama Buddha during his journeys to spread his teachings to protect him and aid in cases needing justified force. =Modern= During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, US saloon-keepers and brothel madams hired bouncers to remove troublesome, violent, or dead-drunk patrons, and to protect the saloon girls and prostitutes. The word \\"bouncer\\" was first popularized in a novel by Horatio Alger, called The Young Outlaw, which was first published in 1875. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century, especially with young people and his books were widely quoted. In Chapter XIV, entitled \\"Bounced\\", a boy is thrown out of a restaurant because he has no money to pay for his meal: An 1883 newspaper article stated that \\"'The Bouncer' is merely the English 'chucker out'.

Huge bouncers patrolled these venues of vice and \\"roughly ejected anyone who violated the loose rules of decorum\\" by engaging in pick-pocketing, jewelry thieving, or bloody fights.Coney Island – Early History (1881–1903) (from private website westland.net) During the 1890s, San Diego had a similarly rough waterfront area and redlight district called the 'Stingaree', where bouncers worked the door at brothels. Prostitutes worked at the area's 120 bawdy houses in small rooms, paying a fee to the procurer who usually was the bouncer or 'protector' of the brothel. The more expensive, higher-class brothels were called \\"parlour houses\\", and they were \\"run most decorously\\", and the \\"best of food and drink was served.\\" To maintain the high-class atmosphere at these establishments, male patrons were expected to act like gentlemen; \\"... if any customer did or said anything out of line, he was asked to leave.

As ballroom dancing was often considered as an activity which could lead to immoral conduct if the dancers got too close, some of the more reputable venues had bouncers to remind patrons not to dance closer than nine inches to their partners. The bouncers' warnings tended to consist of light taps on the shoulder at first, and then progressed to sterner remonstrations.1914 – America, and the phonograph industry, on the verge of the Great War (from the 'intertique.com' website.

The Oasis club, operated by Max Cohen, hired \\"...a lady bouncer by the name of Mickey Steele, a six-foot acrobat from the Pennsylvania coal fields. Mickey was always considerate of the people she bounced; first asking them where they lived and then throwing them in that general direction.

Such scenes were fictionalised in the movie Cabaret. Hitler surrounded himself with a number of former bouncers such as Christian Weber; the SS originated as a group designated to protect party meetings. In early Nazi Germany, some bouncers in underground jazz clubs were also hired to screen for Nazi spies, because jazz was considered a \\"degenerate\\" form of music by the Nazi party. Later during the Nazi regime, bouncers also increasingly barred non-German people (such as foreign workers) from public functions, such as 'German' dances at dance halls. The doorman from the Ohio- Bar in Berlin in 1948 Bouncers also often come into conflict with football hooligans, due to the tendency of groups of hooligans to congregate at pubs and bars before and after games. In the United Kingdom for example, long- running series of feuds between fan groups like The Blades and groups of bouncers in the 1990s were described by researchers. Bouncers have also been known to be associated with criminal gangs, especially in places like Russia, Hong Kong or Japan, where bouncers may often belong to these groups or have to pay the crime syndicates to be able to operate. In Hong Kong, triad-connected reprisal or intimidation attacks against bouncers have been known to occur.The victim, the exception – Hong Kong Stories feature, Journalism and Media Studies Centre, University of Hong Kong, 13 May 2007 Hong Kong also features a somewhat unusual situation where some bouncers are known to work for prostitutes, instead of being their pimps. Hong Kong police have noted that due to the letter of the law, they sometimes had to charge the bouncer for illegally extorting the women when the usually expected dominance situation between the sex worker and her \\"protector\\" was in fact reversed. In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of bouncers have written \\"tell-all\\" books about their experiences on the door. They indicate that male bouncers are respected by some club-goers as the ultimate 'hard men', while at the same time, these bouncers can also be lightning rods for aggression and macho posturing on the part of obnoxious male customers wanting to prove themselves. Bouncing has also started to attract some academic interest as part of ethnographic studies into violent subcultures. Bouncers were selected as one of the groups studied by several English researchers in the 1990s because their culture was seen as \\"grounded in violence\\", as well as because the group had increasingly been \\"demonised\\", especially in common liberal discourse (see Research section of this article).Get Ready To Duck – Winlow, Simon; Hobbs, Dick; Lister, Stuart; Hadfield, Phillip; British Journal of Criminology, No 41, 2001, Pages 536–548. Accessed 4 May 2008. 21st century In 2006, a German newspaper reported that organized crime is operating bouncer extortion rackets in \\"Berlin, Hamburg, the Ruhr Valley and the Rhein-Main region\\" in which bar owners are \\"compelled to hire a bouncer, for 100 euros ($128) per hour\\", to \\"protect\\" against damage to their venue from the \\"wrong\\" type of patron or violence. In 2008, newspapers reported that some bouncers in London and other northern UK towns were \\"extorting cash from [club] businesses\\" by operating protection rackets, in which they offer to sell \\"protection\\" to club owners, telling them \\"you're going to pay us, or else\\" the club owner's venue may be damaged. Research and sociology =Outside studies= A bouncer standing outside a pawn shop In the early 1990s, an Australian government study on violence stated that violent incidents in public drinking locations are caused by the interaction of five factors: aggressive and unreasonable bouncers, groups of male strangers, low comfort (e.g., unventilated, hot clubs), high boredom, and high drunkenness. The research indicated that bouncers did not play as large a role \\"... as expected in the creation of an aggressive or violence prone atmosphere [in bars].\\" However, the study did show that \\"...edgy and aggressive bouncers, especially when they are arbitrary or petty in their manner, do have an adverse effect.\\" The study stated that bouncers: > ...have been observed to initiate fights or further encourage them on > several occasions. Many seem poorly trained, obsessed with their own > machismo, and relate badly to groups of male strangers. Some of them appear > to regard their employment as giving them a licence to assault people. This > may be encouraged by management adherence to a repressive model of > supervision of patrons (\\"if they play up, thump 'em\\"), which in fact does > not reduce trouble, and exacerbates an already hostile and aggressive > situation. In practice many bouncers are not well managed in their work, and > appear to be given a job autonomy and discretion that they cannot handle > well.Australian Violence: Contemporary Perspectives – Chappell, Duncan; > Grabosky, Peter & Strang, Heather; Australian Institute of Criminology, 1991 A 1998 article \\"Responses by Security Staff to Aggressive Incidents in Public Settings\\" in the Journal of Drug Issues examined 182 violent incidents involving crowd controllers (bouncers) that occurred in bars in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The study indicated that in 12% of the incidents the bouncers had good responses, in 20% of the incidents, the bouncers had a neutral response; and in 36% of the incidents, the bouncers \\"... responses were rated as bad—that is, the crowd controllers enhanced the likelihood of violence but were themselves not violent.\\" Finally, \\"... in almost one-third of incidents, 31 per cent, the crowd controllers' responses were rated as ugly. The controllers' actions involved gratuitous aggression, harassment of patrons and provocative behaviour.\\"SECURITY INDUSTRY AMENDMENT (PATRON PROTECTION) BILL 2007 =Inside studies= A bouncer at a pub wearing a distinctive striped shirt At least one major ethnographic study also observed bouncing from within, as part of a British project to study violent subcultures. Beyond studying the bouncer culture from the outside, the group selected a suitable candidate for covert, long-term research. The man had previously worked as a bouncer before becoming an academic, and while conversant with the milieu, it required some time for him to re-enter bouncing work in a new locality.Get Ready To Duck – Winlow, Simon; Hobbs, Dick; Lister, Stuart; Hadfield, Phillip; British Journal of Criminology, No 41, 2001, Page 537. Accessed 8 January 2009. The study has, however, attracted some criticism due to the fact that the researcher, while fulfilling his duties as a bouncer and being required to set aside his academic distance, would have been at risk of losing objectivity—though it was accepted that this quandary might be difficult to resolve.Is there a place for covert research methods in criminology? – Wells, Helen M., Graduate Journal of Social Science, 2004, Vol. 1 Issue 1. Accessed 4 May 2008. One of the main ethical issues of the research was the participation of the researcher in violence, and to what degree he would be allowed to participate. The group could not fully resolve this issue, as the undercover researcher would not have been able to gain the trust of his peers while shying away from the use of force. As part of the study it eventually became clear that bouncers themselves were similarly and constantly weighing up the limits and uses of their participation in violence. The research however found that instead of being a part of the occupation, violence itself was the defining characteristic, a \\"culture created around violence and violent expectation\\". The bouncing culture's insular attitudes also extended to the recruitment process, which was mainly by word of mouth as opposed to typical job recruitment, and also depended heavily on previous familiarity with violence. This does not extend to the prospective bouncer himself having to have a reputation for violence—rather a perception was needed that he could deal with it if required. Various other elements, such as body language or physical looks (muscles, shaved heads) were also described as often expected for entry into bouncing—being part of the symbolic 'narratives of intimidation' that set bouncers apart in their work environment. Training on the job was described as very limited, with the new bouncers being 'thrown into the deep end'—the fact that they had been accepted for the job in the first place including the assessment that they should know what they are doing (though informal observation of a beginner's behaviour was commonplace). In the case of the British research project, the legally required licensing as a bouncer was also found to be expected by employers before applicants started the job (and as licensing generally excluded people with criminal convictions, this kept out some of the more unstable violent personalities). Roles Bouncers monitor a club or venue to \\"detect, report and correct any condition inside/outside the club\\" which could lead to injuries of patrons or staff or to damage of the club or its equipment.Vineyard, Lee. Bouncer Training Guide (National Nightclub Security Council). A key role for bouncers is communicating information within a club to the venue employees who need to know (e.g., regarding injuries, size of crowd outside, capacity of venue, incidents, etc.). Bouncers answer questions about club policies and procedures while controlling crowds (by asking people not to block entrances, exits, stairwells, and other high-traffic areas). Bouncers lead \\"injury and emergency procedures\\" if a patron is injured and requires first aid. In a large nightclub, the bouncers may be part of a security team that includes friskers (who check for weapons and drugs), surveillance staff, a doorman, and floor men, with all of these security staff reporting to a chief of security, who in turn, reports to the general manager. =Character and personality= Norwegian club checking customer identification for proof of age Although a common stereotype of bouncers is that of the thuggish brute, a good club security staff member requires more than just physical qualities such as strength and size: \\"The best bouncers don’t \\"bounce\\" anyone... they talk to people\\" (and remind them of the venue rules).Bouncers & Doormen (from the crimedoctor.com website, Accessed 2 May 2008.)Bouncers to the rescue – Times of India, 2 May 2005 Lee Vineyard states that the \\"tough guy\\" mentality and look of some bouncers, in which they have their sleeves rolled up to show off their biceps and they have their arms crossed, can actually create more potential for fights than a bouncer who greets patrons with a \\"hello\\", and is thus approachable. An ability to judge and communicate well with people will reduce the need for physical intervention, while a steady personality will prevent the bouncer from being easily provoked by customers. Bouncers need to be able to detect the early warning signs of a potential confrontation with a patron, by observing crowds and individuals and spotting the signs of a \\"heated\\" interaction that could become a fight. Bouncers also profit from good written communication skills, because they are often required to document assaults in an incident log or using an incident form. Well-kept incident logs can protect the employee from any potential criminal charges or lawsuits that later arise from an incident. Bouncers need to be polite when answering questions or controlling crowds. In larger clubs, bouncers need to be able to work with a team of bouncers, which may require the use of radios to stay in contact and communicate (particularly between the inside and outside of a club). In bouncer teams, the bouncers must be aware of the location of the other bouncers, and ensure that when one bouncer relocates (e.g., to go to the bathroom), a gap is not left in the venue security. However, British research from the 1990s also indicates that a major part of both the group identity and the job satisfaction of bouncers is related to their self image as a strongly masculine person who is capable of dealing with – and dealing out – violence; their employment income plays a lesser role in their job satisfaction. Bouncer subculture is strongly influenced by perceptions of honour and shame, a typical characteristic of groups that are in the public eye,Get Ready To Duck – Winlow, Simon; Hobbs, Dick; Lister, Stuart; Hadfield, Phillip; British Journal of Criminology, No 41, 2001, Page 541. Accessed 9 January 2009. as well as warrior cultures in general. Factors in enjoying work as a bouncer were also found in the general prestige and respect that was accorded to bouncers, sometimes bordering on hero worship. The camaraderie between bouncers (even of different clubs), as well as the ability to work \\"in the moment\\" and outside of the drudgery of typical jobs were also often cited.Get Ready To Duck – Winlow, Simon; Hobbs, Dick; Lister, Stuart; Hadfield, Phillip; British Journal of Criminology, No 41, 2001, Pages 541–542. Accessed 8 January 2009. The same research has also indicated that the decisions made by bouncers, while seeming haphazard to an outsider, often have a basis in rational logic. The decision to turn certain customers away at the door because of too casual clothing (face control) is for example often based on the perception that the person will be more willing to fight (compared to someone dressed in expensive attire). Many similar decisions taken by a bouncer during the course of a night are also being described as based on experience rather than just personality.Get Ready To Duck – Winlow, Simon; Hobbs, Dick; Lister, Stuart; Hadfield, Phillip; British Journal of Criminology, No 41, 2001, Page 543. Accessed 8 January 2009. =Use of force= A bouncer giving the \\"thumbs up\\" signal Movies often depict bouncers physically throwing patrons out of clubs and restraining drunk customers with headlocks, which has led to a popular misconception that bouncers have (or reserve) the right to use physical force freely. However, in many countries bouncers have no legal authority to use physical force more freely than any other civilian—meaning they are restricted to reasonable levels of force used in self defense, to eject drunk or aggressive patrons refusing to leave a venue, or when restraining a patron who has committed an offence until police arrive. Lawsuits are possible if injuries occur, even if the patron was drunk or using aggressive language. With civil liability and court costs related to the use of force as \\"the highest preventable loss found within the industry...\\" (US)Safety and Security for Liquor Licensees (from the Michigan Licensed Beverage Association's website. Accessed 1 February 2008.) and bars being \\"sued more often for using unnecessary or excessive force than for any other reason\\" (Canada), substantial costs may be incurred by indiscriminate violence against patrons—though this depends heavily on the laws and customs of the country. In Australia, the number of complaints and lawsuits against venues due to the behaviour of their bouncers has been credited with turning many establishments to using former police officers to head their in-house security, instead of hiring private firms.'Cowardly' bouncers terrorising pub, club patrons – The Australian, Wednesday 28 February 2007 In 2007, a bouncer firm in Toronto stated that a major issue for his bouncers is the risk of being charged with assault if a patron is injured because bouncers are dealing with a fight. The concerns about being charged by police may make bouncers reticent to call the police after they break up a bar fight. Lee Vineyard states that judges tend to be prejudiced against bouncers if there are injuries to patrons after bouncers break up a bar fight; as such, he recommends restraint in all bouncer actions, even if the bouncer is defending him or herself from a patron. According to statistical research in Canada, bouncers are as likely to face physical violence in their work as urban-area police officers. The research also found that the likelihood of such encounters increased (with statistical significance) with the number of years the bouncer had worked in his occupation.Nightclub security and surveillance 1 (book excerpt from Policing the nightclub) – Rigakos, George S.; The Canadian Review of Policing Research, 2004. Accessed 5 February 2008. Despite popular misconceptions, bouncers in Western countries are normally unarmed.Betty chats with the new hunk on the block, Vin Diesel – Vin Diesel interview via 'beatboxbettty.com'. Accessed 2 February 2008. Some bouncers may carry weapons such as expandable batons for personal protection,Baton and Handcuff course (from the 'secta.com.au' company website. Accessed 2 February 2008.) but they may not have a legal right to carry a weapon even if they would prefer to do so. An article from 2007 about bouncers in Toronto (Canada) stated that a major security firm instructs its bouncers to buy bulletproof vests, as they have to deal with armed patrons on a nightly basis. Bouncers also face patrons armed with brass knuckles, screwdrivers, and improvised weapons such as broken bottles. Lee Vineyard recommends that bouncers be provided with uniforms by the club, so that patrons can identify the bouncers. During a fight in a bar, if the bouncers are un-uniformed as they approach the altercation, the fighting patrons may believe that the bouncers who are intervening are other fighting patrons, rather than security staff. =Other approaches= A bouncer (wearing a black tennis shirt) controlling access to a well-known pawn shop Use of force training programs teach bouncers ways to avoid using force and explain what types of force are considered allowable by the courts. Some bars have gone so far as to institute policies barring physical contact, where bouncers are instructed to ask a drunk or disorderly patron to leave—if the patron refuses, the bouncers call police. However, if the police are called too frequently, it can reflect badly on the venue upon renewal of its liquor licence. Another strategy used in some bars is to hire smaller, less threatening or female bouncers, because they may be better able to defuse conflicts than large, intimidating bouncers. The more 'impressive' bouncers, in the often tense environments they are supposed to supervise, are also often challenged by aggressive males wanting to prove their machismo.\\"Nightclub Bouncers Tell All – Tales from behind the velvet rope \\" – The Boston Phoenix, via the 'BostonNightclubNews.com' website. Accessed 2 February 2008. Large and intimidating bouncers, whilst providing an appearance of strong security, may also drive customers away in cases where a more relaxed environment is desired. In addition, female security staff, apart from having fewer problems searching female patrons for drugs or weapons and entering women's washrooms to check for illegal activities, are also considered as better able to deal with drunk or aggressive women. In Australia, for example, women comprise almost 20% of the security industry and increasingly work the door as well, using \\"a smile, chat and a friendly but firm demeanor\\" to resolve tense situations.\\"Mate, Don't Call These Bouncers Babe\\" (Abstract) – The New York Times, Wednesday, 18 April 2001 Nearly one in nine of Britain's nightclub bouncers are also women, with the UK's 2003 Licensing Act giving the authorities \\"discretionary power to withhold a venue's licence if it does not employ female door staff\\". This is credited with having \\"opened the door for women to enter the profession\\".\\"Why women want to join the club\\" – The Independent, Tuesday 3 October 2006, via findarticles.com However, female bouncers are still a rarity in many countries, such as in India, where two women who became media celebrities in 2008 for being \\"Punjab's first female bouncers\\" were soon sacked again after accusations of unbecoming behaviour.\\"Chandigarh's brawny female bouncers 'man' nightclub\\" – Nerve of India, Monday 28 July 2008\\"Punjab's first female bouncers lose their jobs\\" – DNA India, Thursday 16 October 2008 The Victoria Event Center has hired a sexual health educator/intimacy coach who acts as a type of bouncer called a \\"consent captain\\". The consent captain monitors bar patrons to stop sexual harassment and sexual assault at social activities at venues and bars. The consent captain intervenes if she sees people who are getting stared at, harassed, or touched without sexual consent. She talks to the person who is feeling uncomfortable and then, if the first person agrees, speaks to the individual whose conduct is unwanted. Like a regular bouncer, the consent captain warns the person engaging in unwanted behavior that those acts are not tolerated in the venue; if the unwanted acts continue, she may \\"eventually ask them to leave\\". The consent captain also checks on people who are intoxicated, to prevent people from taking advantage of their impaired state. Since the consent captain is, in this case, a sexual health educator, she is better able to notice risk situations regarding consent and harassment that regular bouncers might not notice. Regulation and training In many countries, a bouncer must be licensed and lacking a criminal record to gain employment within the security/crowd control sector. In some countries or regions, bouncers may be required to have extra skills or special licenses and certification for first aid, alcohol distribution, crowd control, or fire safety. =Canada= In Canada, bouncers have the right to use reasonable force to expel intoxicated or aggressive patrons. First, the patron must be asked to leave the premises. If the patron refuses to leave, the bouncer can use reasonable force to expel the patron. This guideline has been upheld in a number of court cases.Civil liability of commercial providers of alcohol (PDF) – Folick, Lorne P.S.; Dolden Wallace Folick, Vancouver, April 2005 Under the definition of 'reasonable force', \\"it is perfectly acceptable [for the bouncer] to grab a patron’s arm to remove the patron from the premises\\". However, \\"Only in situations where employees reasonably believe that the conduct of the patron puts them in danger can they inflict harm on a patron and then only to the extent that such force is necessary for self defence\\". In the Newfoundland and Labrador capital of Saint John's, certification of doormen is voluntary. Some establishments require a \\"doorman's certificate\\", provided by the St. Johns Fire Department, that deals with Fire Code. This process requires answering test questions that apply to fire code for the most part, and a basic understanding of the criminal code as it applies to drug use and the use of force. Unfortunately it does not cover the Use of Force Model for all Canadian citizens. including law enforcement, which states that an assault is considered a crime covered by \\"citizens arrest\\" under Canadian law. Other municipalities in the province have no training. Municipal or provincial governance does not exist at the time of this publishing. In British Columbia, door staff security (bouncers) are required to become certified under the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General Office. The course called BST (Basic Security Training) is a 40-hour program that covers law, customer service, and other issue related to security operation. In Alberta, bar and nightclub security staff will have to take a new, government-run training course on correct bouncer behaviour and skills before the end of 2008. The six-hour 'ProTect' course will, among other subjects, teach staff to identify conflicts before they become violent, and how to defuse situations without resorting to force.Bouncers take course or they're out – Edmonton Journal, Saturday 2 February 2008 In Ontario, courts have ruled that \\"a tavern owes a twofold duty of care to its patrons. It must ensure that it does not serve alcohol which would apparently intoxicate or increase the patron's intoxication. Further, it must take positive steps to protect patrons and others from the dangers of intoxication\\". Regarding the second requirement of protecting patrons, the law holds that \\"customers cannot be ejected from your premises if doing so would put them in danger [e.g., due to the patron's intoxication]. Bars can be held liable for ejecting a customer who they know, or should know, is at risk of injury by being ejected.\\"Did you know? (from the October 2005 newsletter of 'Smart Serve Ontario', Ontario, Canada) In Ontario, bartenders and servers must complete the Smart Serve Training Program, which teaches them to recognise the signs of intoxication. The Smart Serve program is also recommended for other staff in bars who have contact with potentially intoxicated patrons, such as bouncers, coat check staff, and valets. The Smart Serve certification program encourages bars to keep Incident Reporting Logs, to use as evidence if an incident goes to court. With the August 2007 Private Security and Investigative Services Act, Ontario law also requires security industry workers, including bouncers, to be licensed.Private Investigators and Security Guards – Licensing (from the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Corrections website. Accessed 5 February 2008.) =Germany= In Germany, doormen may – like any other citizen – defend themselves in self-defense situations using physical force, but they must not interfere with the police work. Their responsibility is limited locally by the property boundaries and content by the personal rights of the guests. Specifically, this means that they can not enforce a person control or search for people. Such on-the-spot checks are always voluntary, but a criterion for entry. Bouncers own like every other the right to detain under § 127 StPO. In addition, the guards are usually also \\"possessor\\" of the security object, which led to many racism- related issues regarding the entry of foreign customers. However, bouncers at discotheques, who work for a security company or are self-employed, have to take a so-called () with the responsible . This is prescribed in § 34 (a) of the Industrial Code. The certificate issued by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce after passing the exam is colloquially called \\"bouncer certificate\\" or simply \\"certificate\\" or \\"34 a\\". The exam consists of a written part with multiple-choice questions and an oral part. The latter can be repeated at a reduced price if it does not exist. Currently, the number of retry attempts is not limited. The costs for the examination depending on IHK location between 150 and 190 euros. =Italy= In Italy, the law defines bouncers as \\"security subsidiary unarmed operator\\" and they must have specific requisites:Art. 1 comma 4 law 6 October 2009, from a) to g) * at least 18 years of age * no alcohol or drugs in preventive clinical analysis * mental and physical suitability * have not been convicted for any intentional crimes * at least lower high school diploma * follow a training course Bouncers must not have ownership of any type of firearm during their service even if they have a valid firearms license. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, as of 2011, bouncers are required to have a COA (Certificate of approval). Like other security work, the person who has the COA has been vetted by the police and cleared through security checks, as well as the courts, to show the person is suitable for the job, and knows New Zealand law to prevent Security Officers going to court for using excessive force and assault on patrons. =Republic of Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland all potential doormen (bouncers) must complete a QQI level 4 course in Door Security Procedures. This allows them to apply for a PSA license (Private Security Authority). The PSA vet all applicants before issuing a license. Some past convictions will disqualify an applicant from working in the security industry. The license issued by the PSA entitles the holder of the license to work on pubs, clubs and event security. The PSA now requires a person to have a license to work in Event Security. =Singapore= Singapore requires all bouncers to undergo a background check and attend a 5-day 'National Skills Recognition System' course for security staff. However, many of the more professional security companies (and larger venues with their own dedicated security staff) have noted that the course is insufficient for the specific requirements of a bouncer and provide their own additional training.How do clubs select bouncers? 'It's not just about wearing a black shirt' – The Electric New Paper, Friday 1 February 2008 =Sweden= In Sweden, there are special security officers referred to as Ordningsvakt with limited policing duties who share the use of force monopoly with the police, thus having more or less the same obligations as the police to report crime and intervene when on duty. They are trained and ordained by the Swedish Police Authority to maintain and enforce public order at venues or areas where the police cannot permanently divert resources to enforce public order themselves. These security officers have powers of citizen's arrest and to verbally dismiss, physically remove, or detain those who disturb or pose an immediate threat to public order or safety, by using a reasonable amount of force. They can also detain or otherwise take into custody those who are drunk and disorderly and turn them over to police custody as soon as possible. An Ordningsvakt is recruited by the police and must go through a battery of physical tests, a language test, and an interview board before going through a two-week training program which teaches behaviour, conflict management, criminal law, physical intervention, the use of telescopic batons and handcuffs, first aid, equal opportunities and discrimination, and arrest procedures. He or she must then be re-certified every three years. At the end of each shift, a written shift report must always be submitted to the police. An Ordningsvakt is either employed by a private security company, such as Securitas or G4S, where they commonly work at shopping malls, hospitals, public transportation, or as privateers employed by bar or nightclub owners. But despite employment, their first and foremost loyalty lies with the police, who manage and supervise them in the field. They can also be used to augment the police at football matches and high-risk football derbies (after receiving special training). An Ordningsvakt is required to wear a special uniform, which is similar to that of a police officer, but made out of a brighter blue colour and with slightly different emblems so they are easily identified as an Ordningsvakt but also make their connection to the police as obvious as possible. Some security officers are allowed to carry firearms, but this is rare. While on duty, an Ordningsvakt, just like a police officer, is regarded as a public servant, and an assault or threats against one will be punished more harshly. A lawful order given by an Ordningsvakt must be obeyed; otherwise, physical force may be used to enforce that order. Resisting at this point is illegal and punishable by prison. =United Kingdom= In the UK, \\"door supervisors\\"—as they are termed—must hold a licence from the Security Industry Authority. The training for a door supervisor licence takes 32.5 hours since the current changes were implemented on 1 January 2015, and includes issues such as behaviour, conflict management, civil and criminal law, search and arrest procedures, drug awareness, recording of incidents and crime scene preservation, licensing law, equal opportunities and discrimination, health and safety at work, physical intervention, and emergency procedures. Licenses must be renewed every three years. One current provider of training is the British Institute of Innkeeping Awarding Body. Licensed door supervisors must wear a blue plastic licence (often worn on the upper arm) whilst on duty. This led to the common misconception that door supervisors are legally obliged to show their ID to members of the public upon request; in reality they only have to present it to police and licensing authorities in order to protect their identities from aggressive clients. The 2010 UK quango reforms includes the SIA amongst many other Quangos the coalition government intended to be disbanded, ostensibly on the overall grounds of cost, despite the SIA being essentially self-funding via licence payments. Whilst this may alleviate to some extent the financial burden on employers and individuals alike, some members of the industry see this as a retrograde step, fearing a return of the organised criminal element to the currently regulated industry. =United States= A bouncer with a bar's hired stiltwalker in the East Village. Requirements for bouncers vary from state to state, with some examples being: California In California, Senate Bill 194 requires any bouncer or security guard to be registered with the State of California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. These guards must also complete a criminal background check, including submitting their fingerprints to the California Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Californians must undertake the \\"Skills Training Course for Security Guards\\" before receiving a security licence. Further courses allow for qualified security personnel to carry batons upon completion of training.New Security Guard Training Regulation (from the California Department of Consumer Affairs website. Accessed 26 March 2008.) Exempted from the Act are peace officers in specified circumstances and guards employed exclusively and regularly by any employer who does not provide contract security services (known as proprietary guards), provided they do not carry or use any deadly weapon in the performance of their duties. New York In New York State, it is illegal for a bar owner to knowingly hire a felon for a bouncer position. Under Article 7 General Business Law, bars and nightclubs are not allowed to hire bouncers without a proper license. Under New York state law only a Private Investigator or watch, guard and patrol agency can supply security guards/bouncers to bars.Last Call for the Falls? (blog entry on Village Voice, with further references) Notable examples The list of notable bouncers includes celebrities and historical figures who worked as bouncers, often before coming to fame in another field or profession. A number of these bouncers were wrestlers (e.g., Dave Bautista, Road Warrior Animal, Rob Terry, Giant Haystacks and Rick Rude). Some, including Bautista, are also actors (e.g., Mr. T, Vin Diesel). Pope Francis worked as a nightclub bouncer in Buenos Aires while a university student. Ants Some types of ant species have evolved a sub-specialisation that has been called a \\"bouncer\\", and performs a similar function (throwing intruders outside) for its fellows. The majors of the Australian Dacetine Orectognathus versicolor ants have massive blunt mandible jaws which are of little use to the prey-capture techniques this trap jaw species normally engages in. Instead, they spend much of their time guarding the nest opening, their jaws cocked.

It contains rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated with employee benefit plans. ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries by: * Requiring the disclosure of financial and other information concerning the plan to beneficiaries; * Establishing standards of conduct for plan fiduciaries; * Providing for appropriate remedies and access to the federal courts. ERISA is sometimes used to refer to the full body of laws that regulate employee benefit plans, which are mainly in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA itself. Responsibility for interpretation and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury (particularly the Internal Revenue Service), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. History In 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy created the President's Committee on Corporate Pension Plans. The movement for pension reform gained some momentum when the Studebaker Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, closed its plant in 1963. Its pension plan was so poorly funded that Studebaker could not afford to provide all employees with their pensions. The company created a program in which 3,600 workers who had reached the retirement age of 60 received full pension benefits, 4,000 workers aged 40–59 who had ten years with Studebaker received lump sum payments valued at roughly 15% of the actuarial value of their pension benefits, and the remaining 2,900 workers received no pensions. In 1963, Senator John L. McClellan (D) of Arkansas began an investigation through the Permanent Investigations Senate Subcommittee into labor leader George Barasch, alleging misuse and diversion of $4,000,000 of union benefit funds. After three years the investigation had failed to find any wrongdoing, but had resulted in several proposed laws, including McClellan's October 12, 1965 bill setting new fiduciary standards for plan trustees. Additionally, due much in part to his \\"dismay\\" over Barasch's sole control over union benefit plan funds, Senator Jacob K. Javits (R) of New York also introduced bills in 1965 and 1967 increasing regulation on welfare and pension funds to limit the control of plan trustees and administrators and to address the funding, vesting, reporting, and disclosure issues identified by the presidential committee. His bills were opposed by business groups and labor unions, which sought to retain the flexibility they enjoyed under pre-ERISA law. Provisions from all three bills ultimately evolved into the guidelines enacted in ERISA. On September 12, 1972, NBC broadcast an hour-long television special, Pensions: The Broken Promise, that showed millions of Americans the consequences of poorly funded pension plans and onerous vesting requirements. In the following years, Congress held a series of public hearings on pension issues and public support for pension reform grew significantly. ERISA was enacted in 1974 and signed into law by President Gerald Ford on September 2, 1974, Labor Day. In the years since 1974, ERISA has been amended repeatedly. Coverage =Pension plans= ERISA does not require employers to establish pension plans. Likewise, as a general rule, it does not require that plans provide a minimum level of benefits. Instead, it regulates the operation of a pension plan once it has been established. Under ERISA, pension plans must provide for vesting of employees' pension benefits after a specified minimum number of years. ERISA requires that the employers who sponsor plans satisfy certain minimum funding requirements. ERISA also regulates the manner in which a pension plan may pay benefits. For example, a defined benefit plan must pay a married participant's pension as a \\"joint-and-survivor annuity\\" that provides continuing benefits to the surviving spouse unless both the participant and the spouse waive the survivor coverage. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was established by ERISA to provide coverage in the event that a terminated defined benefit pension plan does not have sufficient assets to provide the benefits earned by participants. Later amendments to ERISA require an employer who withdraws from participation in a multiemployer pension plan with insufficient assets to pay all participants' vested benefits to contribute the pro rata share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits liability. There are two main types of pension plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans provide retirees with a certain level of benefits based on years of service, salary and other factors. Defined contribution plans provide retirees with benefits based on the amount and investment performance of contributions made by the employee and/or employer over a number of years.Lemke and Lins, ERISA for Money Managers §1:1 (Thomson West, 2012). =Health benefit plans= ERISA does not require that an employer provide health insurance to its employees or retirees, but it regulates the operation of a health benefit plan if an employer chooses to establish one. ERISA exempts health insurance plans from various state- specific laws, particularly contract and tort law, to create federal uniformity; , about 60% of insured employees in the US were in self-funded plans subject to ERISA. ERISA has led to tension with reforms which partner with the states, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. There have been several significant amendments to ERISA concerning health benefit plans: * The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) provides some employees and beneficiaries with the right to continue their coverage under an employer-sponsored group health benefit plan for a limited time after the occurrence of certain events that would otherwise cause termination of such coverage, such as the loss of employment. * The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits a health benefit plan from refusing to cover an employee's pre-existing medical conditions in some circumstances. It also bars health benefit plans from certain types of discrimination on the basis of health status, genetic information, or disability. Other relevant amendments to ERISA include the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, the Mental Health Parity Act, and the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act. During the 1990s and 2000s, many employers who promised lifetime health coverage to their retirees limited or eliminated those benefits. Alt URL ERISA does not provide for vesting of health care benefits in the way that employees become vested in their accrued pension benefits. Employees and retirees who were promised lifetime health coverage may be able to enforce those promises by suing the employer for breach of contract, or by challenging the right of the health benefit plan to change its plan documents to eliminate promised benefits. Pension vesting Before ERISA, some defined benefit pension plans required decades of service before an employee's benefit became vested. It was not unusual for a plan to provide no benefit at all to an employee who left employment before the specified retirement age (e.g. 65), regardless of the length of the employee's service. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, employer contributions made after 2006 to a defined contribution plan must become vested at 100% after three years or under a 2nd-6th year gradual-vesting schedule (20% per year beginning with the second year of service, i.e. 100% after six years). (ref. 120 Stat. 988 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.) The Technical Explanation of H.R.4, of the PPA, Page 156 Vesting Rules, states that the PPA amends both the ERISA and Code. Different rules apply with respect to employer contributions made before 2007. Employee contributions are always 100% vested. Accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan must become vested at 100% after five years or under a 3rd-7th year gradual vesting schedule (20% per year beginning with the third year of vesting service, and 100% after seven years). (ref. 26 U.S.C. 411(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. 203(a)(2).) Pension funding ERISA established minimum funding requirements for pension plans, which includes defined benefit plans and money purchase plans but not profit sharing or stock bonus plans. Before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), a defined benefit plan maintained a funding standard account, which was charged annually for the cost of benefits earned during the year and credited for employer contributions. Increases in the plan's liabilities due to benefit improvements, changes in actuarial assumptions, and any other reasons were amortized and charged to the account; decreases in the plan's liabilities were amortized and credited to the account. Every year, the employer was required to contribute the amount necessary to keep the funding standard account from falling below $0 at year-end. In 2008, when the PPA funding rules went into effect, single-employer pension plans no longer maintain funding standard accounts. The funding requirement under PPA is simply that a plan must stay fully funded (that is, its assets must equal or exceed its liabilities). If a plan is fully funded, the minimum required contribution is the cost of benefits earned during the year. If a plan is not fully funded, the contribution also includes the amount necessary to amortize over seven years the difference between its liabilities and its assets. Stricter rules apply to severely underfunded plans (called \\"at-risk status\\"). The PPA has different funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans, which preserve most of the pre-PPA funding rules, including the funding standard account. Under PPA, increases and decreases in the plan's liabilities are amortized, but the amortization period for benefit improvements adopted after 2007 are shortened. As with single-employer plans, multiemployer pension plans that are significantly underfunded are subject to restrictions. The restrictions, which may limit the plan's ability to improve benefits or require the plan to reduce employees' benefits, vary depending whether a pension plan's funding status is termed \\"endangered\\", \\"seriously endangered\\", or \\"critical\\". The restrictions accompanying each deficient funding status are progressively more severe as funding status worsens. ERISA preemption ERISA Section 514 preempts all state laws that relate to any employee benefit plan, with certain, enumerated exceptions.See, e.g., . The most important exceptions — i.e. state laws that survive despite the fact that they may relate to an employee benefit plan — are state insurance, banking, or securities laws, generally applicable criminal laws, and domestic relations orders that meet ERISA's qualification requirements.. ERISA also does not govern public pension funds, but it is often looked to for guidance regarding fund duties in addition to state pension codes. A major limitation is placed on the insurance exception, known as the \\"deemer clause\\", which essentially provides that state insurance law cannot operate on employer self-funded benefit plans. The Supreme Court has created another limitation on the insurance exception, in which even a law that regulates insurance is preempted if it purports to add a remedy to a participant or beneficiary in an employee benefit plan that ERISA did not explicitly provide. A three-part analysis is used to decide whether ERISA preempts state law. First, preemption is presumed if the state law “relates to” any employee benefit plan. Second, a state law relating to an employee benefit plan may be protected from preemption under ERISA if it regulates insurance, banking, or securities. The third step of the ERISA preemption analysis concerns the “deemer” clause. State insurance regulation may be saved only to the extent that it regulates genuine insurance companies or insurance contracts. As a result, a state may not “deem” that an employee benefit plan is an insurance plan in an effort to sidestep preemption if the benefit plan would not otherwise meet the requirements as an insurance company or contract. The “deemer” clause therefore restricts the use of the “savings” clause to conventionally insured employee benefit plans. The result of ERISA preemption is that the only remedy available to a covered person who has been denied benefits or dropped from coverage altogether is to seek an order from a federal judge (no jury trial is permitted) directing the Plan (in actuality the insurance company that underwrites and administers it) to pay for \\"medically necessary\\" care. If a person dies before the case can be heard, however, the claim dies with him or her, since ERISA provides no remedy for injury or wrongful death caused by the withholding of care. Even if benefits are improperly denied, the insurance company cannot be sued for any resulting injury or wrongful death, regardless of whether it acted in bad faith in denying benefits. Insurers operating ERISA plans enjoy several immunities not available to other types of insurance companies. ERISA preempts all conflicting state laws, including state statutes prohibiting unfair claims practices and causes of action arising under state common law for insurance bad faith.Kidneigh v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 345 F.3d 1182, 1184 (10th Cir. 2003); Bast v. Prudential Life Ins. Co. of Am., 150 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 1998); There is no right to a jury trial in ERISA benefits actions.Thomas v. Oregon Fruit Prods. Co., 228 F.3d 991, 996-97 (9th Cir. 2000) (listing cases and joining their holding). Although Americans normally take for granted the right to testify on their behalf, plaintiffs have no right to present live testimony in ERISA bench trials, in which the judge simply reads through the documents that formed the record originally before the ERISA plan administrator and performs de novo review.Kearney v. Standard Ins. Co., 175 F.3d 1084, 1094-1095 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Finally, punitive damages are not allowed in actions for ERISA benefits. It has been argued that in the case of health benefits, the effect of all of this may paradoxically have been to leave plan participants worse off than if ERISA had not been enacted. Many persons included among the some 29 million people presently without health care coverage in the United States are former ERISA \\"subscribers\\", insurance terminology for Plan beneficiaries, who have been denied benefits-usually on the ground that the prescribed care is not medically necessary or is \\"experimental\\"-or dropped from coverage, often because they have lost their jobs due to the very illness for which care was denied. Many consumer and health care advocates have called for a \\"restoration of the freedom of contract enforcement,\\" to the 75% of Americans insured under these work place group plans-in effect, a repeal of the ERISA preemption. Permitting these insured persons access to customary state remedies (98% of all civil disputes are resolved in state courts) would, they contend, result in a substantial reduction in arbitrary denial of care benefits, simultaneously alleviating a major burden on state Medicaid systems and clogged federal court dockets. =Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act exemption= ERISA contains an exemption specifically regarding the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act (Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 393), which was enacted by that state a few months before ERISA was signed into law. As a result, private employers in Hawaii are bound by the rules of that state law in addition to ERISA. The exemption also freezes the law in its original 1974 form, meaning the Hawaii legislature is not able to make non-administrative amendments without Congressional approval. The Statute =Title I: Protection of Employee Benefit Rights= Title I protects employees' rights to their benefits. The following are some of the ways in which it achieves that goal: * Participants must be provided plan summaries. * Employers are required to report information about the plan to the Labor Department and provide it to participants upon request. The information is reported on Form 5500, which is available for public inspection. * If a participant requests, the employer must provide the participant with a calculation of her or his accrued and vested pension benefits. * Employers have fiduciary responsibility to the participants and to the plan. * Certain service providers, such as investment managers, have fiduciary responsibilities to the plan.Lemke and Lins, ERISA for Money Managers §§1:2 to 1:4 (Thomson West, 2013). * Certain transactions between the employer and the plan are prohibited. * Certain transactions between fiduciary and the plan, or between the plan and certain \\"parties in interest\\" are prohibited (unless otherwise exempt).Lemke and Lins, ERISA for Money Managers §1:3, §1:5 (Thomson West, 2013). * A pension plan is barred from investing more than 10% of its assets in employer securities. Title I also includes the pension funding and vesting rules described above. The United States Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (\\"EBSA\\") is responsible for overseeing Title I, promulgating regulations implementing and interpreting the statute as well as conducting enforcement. Plan fiduciaries and plan participants may also bring certain civil causes of action in Federal Court. The current Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits and head of the Employee Benefits Security Administration is the Hon. Preston Rutledge, who was confirmed on December 22, 2017. Past Assistant Secretaries include the Hon. Phyllis Borzi, the Hon. Bradford P. Campbell, the Hon. Ann L. Combs and the Hon. Olena Berg-Lacy. =Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code Relating to Retirement Plans= Title II amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The changes include the following: * Addition of various requirements for a pension plan to be tax-favored (\\"qualified\\"), including: ** The plan must offer retirees the option of a joint-and-survivor annuity ** Plan benefits may not discriminate in favor of officers and highly paid employees ** Plans are subject to the pension funding and vesting rules described above. * Imposition of maximum limits on the annual benefit that may be paid from a qualified defined benefit pension plan and the annual contribution that may be made to a qualified defined contribution pension plan * The creation of individual retirement accounts (IRAs). * Revision of rules concerning the maximum tax deduction allowed with respect to a contribution to a pension plan * Imposition of an excise tax if the employer fails to make a required contribution to a pension plan or engages in transactions prohibited by ERISA =Title III: Jurisdiction, Administration, Enforcement; Joint Pension Task Force, Etc.= Title III outlines procedures for co-ordination between the Labor and Treasury Departments in enforcing ERISA. It also created the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, which licenses actuaries to perform a variety of actuarial tasks required of pension plans under ERISA. The Joint Board administers two examinations to prospective Enrolled Actuaries. After an individual passes the two exams and completes sufficient relevant professional experience, she or he becomes an Enrolled Actuary. =Title IV: Plan Termination Insurance= Title IV created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure benefits of participants in underfunded terminated plans. It also describes the procedures that a pension plan must follow to terminate itself, and for the PBGC to initiate an involuntary termination. Single-employer plans =Standard termination= An employer may terminate a single-employer plan under a standard termination if the plan's assets equal or exceed its liabilities. If the assets are less than the liabilities, the employer must contribute the amount necessary to fully fund the plan. A standard termination is sometimes referred to as a voluntary termination because the employer has chosen to terminate the plan. In a standard termination, all accrued benefits under the plan become 100% vested. The plan must purchase annuity contracts for all participants. If the plan permits the payment of lump sums, employees may be offered the choice of a lump sum payment or an annuity. If any assets remain in the plan after a standard termination has been completed, the provisions of the plan control their treatment. In some plans, the excess assets revert to the employer; in other plans, the excess assets must be used to increase participants' benefits. =Distress termination= An employer may terminate a single- employer plan under a distress termination if the employer demonstrates to the PBGC that one of these conditions exists: * Employer faces liquidation under bankruptcy proceedings. * Costs of continuing the plan will make the business fail. * Costs of continuing the plan have become unreasonably burdensome solely because of a decline in the employer's workforce. If the PBGC finds that a distress termination is appropriate, the plan's liabilities are calculated and compared with its assets. Depending on the difference between the two values, the termination may be treated as if it had been a standard termination or as if it had been initiated by the PBGC. =Termination initiated by the PBGC= PBGC may initiate proceedings to terminate a single-employer plan if it determines one of the following: * The employer has not made its minimum required contributions to the plan. * The plan will not be able to pay benefits when due. * PBGC's long-term cost can be expected to be unreasonably higher if it does not terminate the plan. A termination initiated by the PBGC is sometimes called an involuntary termination. The benefits paid by the PBGC after a plan termination may be less than those promised by the employer. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for details. Multiemployer plans A multiemployer plan may be terminated in one of three ways: * It may be amended so that participants receive no credit for future service. * All contributing employers may withdraw from the plan or stop making contributions to it. * It may convert into a defined contribution plan. Non-ERISA status and bankruptcy In 2005, the BAPCPA amended the Bankruptcy Code, by exempting most organized retirement plans, even those not subject to ERISA, and accorded them protected status, claimable as exempt property by a debtor declaring bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Now, most pension plans have the same protection as an ERISA anti-alienation clause giving these pensions the same protection as a spendthrift trust. The only remaining unprotected areas are the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP IRA. The SEP IRA is functionally similar to a self-settle trust, and a sound policy reason would exist to not shield SEP IRAs, but many financial planners argue that a rollover (or direct transfer) from a SEP IRA to a rollover IRA would give those funds protected status, too. Finding statutes Portions of ERISA are codified in various places of the United States Code, including , and Internal Revenue Code sections and (relating to the Individual Retirement Account) and sections through , and , and .

Toklas is a book by Gertrude Stein, written in October and November of 1932 and published in 1933.[1] Stein, Gertrude. Writings 1903–1932. New York: Library of America, 1998, p. 924 It employs the form of an autobiography authored by Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. In 1998, Modern Library ranked it as one of the 20 greatest English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century. Summary of chapters Alice B. Toklas, photographed by Carl Van Vechten, 1949 =Before I came to Paris= Alice B. Toklas, as narrator of the work, says she was born into an affluent family in San Francisco. Later she met Gertrude Stein's sister-in-law during the fires in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and decided to move to Paris in 1907. =My Arrival in Paris= Alice talks about the important role of Helene, Gertrude's housemaid, in their household in Paris. She mentions preparations for an art exhibition. She discusses Pablo Picasso and his mistress Fernande. Picasso and Fernande end their relationship, and Fernande moves to Montparnasse to teach French. Alice and Gertrude visit her there. =Gertrude Stein in Paris, 1903–1907= Alice tells of Gertrude and her brother Leo Stein buying paintings by Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse from Ambroise Vollard. They subsequently all become friends. She next discusses spending the summer with Gertrude in Fiesole, Italy, while Picasso goes to Spain. Back in France, Gertrude falls out with Guillaume Apollinaire. Later, Picasso has an argument with Matisse. =Gertrude Stein before she came to Paris= Alice tells how Gertrude Stein was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, then moved to Vienna, to Passy, and finally to New York City and California. She attended Radcliffe College, where she was taught by William James. She decided to study for a Master's degree at Johns Hopkins University but dropped out because she was bored, then moved to London and was bored there too, returned to America, and eventually settled in Paris. =1907–1914= Alice tells stories about Matisse, Apollinaire, and many other Cubist artists. She recounts holidays in Italy and Spain with Gertrude. Finally, they move to England on the eve of World War I to meet with Gertrude's editor, leaving Mildred Aldrich alone in Paris. =The War= Gertrude and Alice begin the war years in England, and then go briefly to France to rescue Gertrude's writings. They then live in Spain for a while, and eventually move back to France. There, they do volunteer work for the American Fund for the French Wounded, driving around France to help the wounded and homeless. By the end of the war, Paris seems changed. =After the War, 1919–1932= Alice tells of Gertrude's argument with T. S. Eliot after he finds one of her writings inappropriate. She talks about her friendship with Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway, who helped with the publication of The Making of Americans. There the couple makes friends with a coterie of Russian artists, but they constitute no artistic movement. Later, Gertrude gives a lecture at Oxford University. Alice then mentions more parties with artists. Later, they abridge The Making of Americans to four hundred pages for commercial reasons and devise the idea of authoring an autobiography. \\"... remarks are not literature\\" Literary significance and criticism Gertrude Stein admitted to writing the work in six weeks with an end to making money.Souhami, Diana - Gertrude and Alice: Gertrude Stein and Alice B.Toklas, Rivers Oram Press/Pandora List, 20 Feb 1992, p. 187 However, she did not like writing it for that particular reason, and Alice didn't think it would be a success.Souhami, p. 189 It was the first of her writings to be published in the Atlantic Monthly, much to her joy. The magazine published sixty per cent of the book, in four installments.Souhami, p.190-191 As for her friends, Carl Van Vechten liked it; Henry McBride thought it was too commercial; Ernest Hemingway called it a 'damned pitiful book'; Henri Matisse was offended by the descriptions of his wife; and Georges Braque thought Stein had misconstrued Cubism. Her brother Leo Stein deemed it a 'farrago of lies'.Souhami, p. 192-194 The commercial success, however, that came with her book enabled Stein to live a more prosperous lifestyle.Souhami, p. 195 According to Virgil Thomson, who wrote music to libretti authored by Stein, the \\"book is in every way except actual authorship Alice Toklas's book; it reflects her mind, her language, her private view of Gertrude, also her unique narrative powers. Every story in it is told as Alice herself had always told it.... Every story that ever came into the house eventually got told in Alice's way, and this was its definitive version.\\"Thomson, Virgil - \\"A Portrait of Gertrude Stein\\", from An Autobiography of Virgil Thomson, p. 176-177 The book is considered to be one of the most accessible of Stein's works. Several literary critics, including Jeanette Winterson, have noted that Stein creates a new format, building upon Virginia Woolf's fictional biography, Orlando, in her own reinterpretation of the autobiography.Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998).

It is a broad term to identify the behavior all people exhibit to tend to \\"see things\\" based on their particular frame of reference.

One of the reasons this might occur might be because people are simply bombarded with too much stimuli every day to pay equal attention to everything, therefore, they pick and choose according to their own needs.https://web.archive.org/web/20100522194645/http://lilt.ilstu.edu/rrpope/rrpopepwd/articles/perception3.html To understand when and why a particular region of a scene is selected, studies observed and described the eye movements of individuals as they go about performing specific tasks. In this case, vision was an active process that integrated scene properties with specific, goal-oriented oculomotor behaviour.Canosa, R.L. (2009). Real-world vision: selective perception and task. ACM Trans. Appl. Percpt., 6, 2, Article 11, 34 pages. Several other studies have shown that students who were told they were consuming alcoholic beverages (which in fact were non-alcoholic) perceived themselves as being \\"drunk\\", exhibited fewer physiological symptoms of social stress, and drove a simulated car similarly to other subjects who had actually consumed alcohol. The result is somewhat similar to the placebo effect. In one classic study on this subject related to the hostile media effect (which is itself an example of selective perception), viewers watched a filmstrip of a particularly violent Princeton-Dartmouth American football game. Princeton viewers reported seeing nearly twice as many rule infractions committed by the Dartmouth team than did Dartmouth viewers. One Dartmouth alumnus did not see any infractions committed by the Dartmouth side and erroneously assumed he had been sent only part of the film, sending word requesting the rest.Hastorf, A.H. & Cantril, H. (1954). They saw a game: A case study. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 49, 129–134. Selective perception is also an issue for advertisers, as consumers may engage with some ads and not others based on their pre-existing beliefs about the brand. Seymour Smith, a prominent advertising researcher, found evidence for selective perception in advertising research in the early 1960s, and he defined it to be \\"a procedure by which people let in, or screen out, advertising material they have an opportunity to see or hear. They do so because of their attitudes, beliefs, usage preferences and habits, conditioning, etc.\\"Nowak, Theodore and Smith, Seymour. \\"Advertising Works—And Advertising Research Does Too.\\" Presentation to ESOMAR. Spain: 1970s. People who like, buy, or are considering buying a brand are more likely to notice advertising than are those who are neutral toward the brand. This fact has repercussions within the field of advertising research because any post-advertising analysis that examines the differences in attitudes or buying behavior among those aware versus those unaware of advertising is flawed unless pre-existing differences are controlled for. Advertising research methods that utilize a longitudinal design are arguably better equipped to control for selective perception.

The base's of beaches make it a major area for amphibious assault training, and its location between two deep-water ports (Wilmington and Morehead City) allows for fast deployments. The main base is supplemented by six satellite facilities: Marine Corps Air Station New River, Camp Geiger, Stone Bay, Courthouse Bay, Camp Johnson, and the latest addition to the facility, the Greater Sandy Run Training Area. The Marine Corps port facility at Radio Island, is located between Beaufort and Morehead City, next to Duke Marine Lab and adjacent to the NC State Port in Morehead City, NC.

On May 1 of that year, Lt. Col. William P. T. Hill began construction on Marine Barracks New River. The first base headquarters was in a summer cottage on Montford Point, and then moved to Hadnot Point in 1942. Later that year it was renamed in honor of the 13th Commandant of the Marine Corps, John A. Lejeune. One of the satellite facilities of Camp Lejeune served for a while as a third boot camp for the Marines, in addition to Parris Island and San Diego. That facility, Montford Point, was established after Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802. Between 1942 and 1949, a brief era of segregated training for black Marines, the camp at Montford Point trained 20,000 African-Americans. After the military was ordered to fully integrate, Montford Point was renamed Camp Gilbert H. Johnson and became the home of the Marine Corps Combat Service Support Schools. American Indian Women Reservists at Camp Lejeune during 1943 Betty Grable at the New River, 1942 MCB Camp Lejeune can help to prepare warfighters for combat and humanitarian missions abroad. Camp Lejeune takes advantage of 156,000 acres, 11 miles of beach capable of supporting amphibious operations, 32 gun positions, 48 tactical landing zones, three state-of-the-art training facilities for Military Operations in Urban Terrain and 80 live fire ranges to include the Greater Sandy Run Training Area. Military forces from around the world come to Camp Lejeune on a regular basis for bilateral and NATO-sponsored exercises.

Pollution From at least 1957 through 1987, Marines and their families at Lejeune drank and bathed in water contaminated with toxins at concentrations 240 to 3400 times permitted by safety standards, and at least 850 former residents filed claims for nearly $4 billion from the military. The Multi-District Litigation was dismissed on North Carolina statute of repose grounds on December 5, 2016, and the appeal to the 11th Circuit is ongoing. Straw, et. al. v. United States, 16-17573 (11th Cir.). Straw has appealed this case to the U.S. Supreme Court twice, with one currently pending in the Supreme Court docket. Disability activist Andrew U. D. Straw is also pursuing claims based on implied contract and Fifth Amendment Takings theories at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, stating that the U.S. Marine Corps' UCMJ responsibilities imply a contract to protect U.S. Marine Corps family members. Straw v. United States, 1:17-cv-00560 (U.S. COFC). This case was dismissed and denied on appeal also. Straw has also advocated for legislative reform to avoid the legal arguments of the Department of Justice. The main chemicals involved were trichloroethylene (TCE), a degreaser, perchloroethylene (PCE), a dry cleaning solvent, and benzene; however, more than 70 chemicals have been identified as contaminants at Lejeune. A 1974 base order required safe disposal of solvents and warned that improper handling could cause drinking water contamination. Yet solvents were dumped or buried near base wells for years.Camp Lejeune residents blame rare cancer cluster on the water For three decades, dry-cleaning chemicals and industrial solvents laced the water used by local Marines and their families. Mike Partain and at least 19 others developed male breast cancer. The base's wells were shut off in the mid-1980s, but were placed back online in violation of the law. In 1982, Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were found to be in Camp Lejeune's drinking water supply. Coverage of what happened at Camp Lejeune VOC contamination of groundwater can cause birth defects and other ill health effects in pregnant and nursing mothers. This information was not made public for nearly two decades when the government attempted to identify those who may have been exposed. An advocacy group called The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten was created to inform possible victims of the contamination at Lejeune. The group's website includes an introduction with some basic information about the contamination at Lejeune, including that many health problems various types of cancer, leukemia, miscarriages and birth defects, have been noted in people who drank the contaminated water. According to the site, numerous base housing areas were affected by the contamination, including Tarawa Terrace, Midway Park, Berkeley Manor, Paradise Point, Hadnot Point, Hospital Point, and Watkins Village.The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten. 2008-02-04. Access date 2008-02-06 On March 8, 2010, Paul Buckley of Hanover, Massachusetts, received a 100%, service connected disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs for cancer (Multiple Myeloma), which was linked to toxic water exposure on Camp Lejeune. This is believed to be the first time the government has admitted the link between the contamination and illnesses.Sawyer, Diane, and Steve Osunsami, \\"Toxic Water\\", ABC World News, March 19, 2010. In 2007, Jerry Ensminger, a retired Marine master sergeant, found a document dated 1981 that described a radioactive dump site near a rifle range at the camp. According to the report, the waste was laced with strontium-90, an isotope known to cause cancer and leukemia. According to Camp Lejeune's installation restoration program manager, base officials learned in 2004 about the 1981 document. Ensminger served in the Marine Corps for 24 and a half years, and lived for part of that time at Camp Lejeune. In 1985 his 9-year-old daughter, Janey, died of cancer. On July 6, 2009, Laura Jones filed suit against the US government over the contaminated water at the base. Jones previously lived at the base where her husband, a Marine, was stationed. Jones has lymphoma and now lives in Iowa.Contaminated Water At Base Spurs Suit July 7, 2009 Twenty former residents of Camp Lejeune—all men who lived there during the 1960s and the 1980s—have been diagnosed with breast cancer. In April 2009, the United States Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry withdrew a 1997 public health assessment at Camp Lejeune that denied any connection between the toxins and illness.ATSDR Withdraws Scientifically Flawed Public Health Document As many as 500,000 people may have been exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune over a period of 30 years.\\"Male breast cancer patients blame water at Marine base =Janey Ensminger Act= On 18 July 2012 the US Senate passed a bill, called the Janey Ensminger Act in honor of retired Marine Master Sergeant Jerry Ensminger's daughter Janey who died of cancer at age 9, authorizing medical care to military and family members who had resided at the base between 1957 and 1987 and developed conditions linked to the water contamination. The measure applies to up to 750,000 people.Ordonez, Franco, (McClatchy), \\"Senate Passes Lejeune Water-Contamination Bill\\", Raleigh News & Observer, 19 July 2012 The House approved the bill on 31 July 2012.Ordonez, Franco, \\"Congress Helps Camp Lejeune Families Hurt By Tainted Water\\", McClatchy, 1 August 2012 President Obama signed the bill into law on 6 August 2012.Ordonez, Franco, and Barbara Barrett, (McClatchy), \\"Obama Signs Law Giving Health Care To Lejeune Tainted-Water Victims\\", Raleigh News & Observer, 7 August 2012 The bill applies to 15 specific ailments believed to be linked to the contamination, including cancer of the esophagus, lung, breast, bladder or kidney; leukemia; multiple myeloma; myleodysplasic syndromes; renal toxicity; hepatic steatosis; female infertility; miscarriage; scleroderma; and/or neurobehavioral effects or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Department of Veterans Affairs is assigned by the bill to provide the medical care. To fund the medical care, the bill extends higher fees for VA home loan guarantees to 1 October 2017.Philpott, Tom, \\"'First step of justice' for ailing Camp Lejeune vets, families\\", Stars and Stripes, 9 August 2012 A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 potentially curbs groundwater contamination lawsuits by families at Camp Lejeune. Federal law, which imposes a two-year statute of limitations after the harm is discovered, would pre-empt North Carolina's 10-year \\"statute of repose\\" law. State law makers are trying to eliminate the state prohibition on lawsuits being filed 10 years after the last pollution occurred or from the time a polluted property was sold. Marine Corps Brig The military prison at Camp Lejeune has been in operation since 1968 and currently has a maximum capacity of 280 inmates who are incarcerated between 30 and 90 days. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) recommended in 2005 that the brig be closed and the Secretary of Defense has to implement the commission's recommendations by a date still unknown. A new brig was built at Camp Allen in Norfolk, Virginia with a small detention facility built at Camp Lejeune to hold detainees awaiting court martial. A new brig was constructed at Camp Lejeune finishing in the early fall of 2012. The old brig was decommissioned and demolished in the late fall of 2012.

It is also known as a tilt indicator, tilt sensor, tilt meter, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope) for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance. A tilt sensor can measure the tilting in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes. In contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earth's ground plane, is to use an accelerometer. Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers. In aircraft, the \\"ball\\" in turn coordinators or turn and bank indicators is sometimes referred to as an inclinometer. History Drawing of an inclinometer, Museo Galileo, Florence. Inclinometers include examples such as Well's in-clinometer, the essential parts of which are a flat side, or base, on which it stands, and a hollow disc just half filled with some heavy liquid. The glass face of the disc is surrounded by a graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid stands, with reference to the flat base. The zero line is parallel to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is horizontal; the 90 degree is perpendicular to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or plumb. Intervening angles are marked, and, with the aid of simple conversion tables, the instrument indicates the rate of fall per set distance of horizontal measurement, and set distance of the sloping line. The Well's clinometer The Abney level is a handheld surveying instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its crosshair) with the reflection of the bubble in the spirit level of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer. One of the more famous inclinometer installations was on the panel of the Ryan NYP \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\"—in 1927 Charles Lindbergh chose the lightweight Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer to give him climb and descent angle information. Uses Hand- held clinometers are used for a variety of surveying and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for cave survey. In prospecting for minerals, clinometers are used to measure the strike and dip of geologic formations. In forestry, tree height measurement can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods. Major artillery guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances. Permanently-installed tiltmeters are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure. Measuring slope with a clinometer =Factors which influence the use of inclinometers= (Overall accuracy varies depending on the type of tilt sensor (or inclinometer) and technology used) * Gravity * Temperature (drift), zero offset, linearity, vibration, shock, cross-axis sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration. * A clear line of sight between the user and the measured point is needed. * A well defined object is required to obtain the maximum precision. * The angle measurement precision and accuracy is limited to slightly better than one arcsec. Accuracy Certain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001°; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.01°. An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity—electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from ±0.01–2° depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.

They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt. Important specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, orthogonal. The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. Common implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, Liquid Capacitive, electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum. Tilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. Yoshi's Universal Gravitation and Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The PlayStation 3 and Wii game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games. Inclinometers are also used in civil engineering, for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon. Some inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on CAN (Controller Area Network). In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized CANopen profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable. Two-axis digital inclinometer Two-axis digital inclinometer Traditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range. However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with MEMS tilt sensors provides simultaneous two- dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum. Typical advantages of using two-axis MEMS inclinometers over conventional single-axis \\"bubble\\" or mechanical leveling instruments may include: * Simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional (X-Y plane) tilt angles (i.e. pitch & roll), can eliminate tedious swapping back-and-forth experienced when using a single- axis level, for example to adjust machine footings to attain a precise leveling position. * Digital compensation and precise calibration for non- linearity, for example for operating temperature variation, resulting in higher accuracy over a wider measurement range. * The accelerometer sensors may generate numerical data in the form of vibration profiles to enable a machine installer to track and assess alignment quality in real-time and verify a structure's positional stability by comparing leveling profiles before and after it is set up.  Inclinometer with gyroscope  As inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the abovementioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations. Applications Symbol used in geotechnical drawings Inclinometers are used for: * Determining latitude using Polaris (in the Northern Hemisphere) or the two stars of the constellation Crux (in the Southern Hemisphere). * Determining the angle of the Earth's magnetic field with respect to the horizontal plane. * Showing a deviation from the true vertical or horizontal. * Surveying, to measure an angle of inclination or elevation. * Alerting an equipment operator that it may tip over. * Measuring angles of elevation, slope, or incline, e.g. of an embankment. * Measuring slight differences in slopes, particularly for geophysics. Such inclinometers are, for instance, used for monitoring volcanoes, or for measuring the depth and rate of landslide movement. * Measuring movements in walls or the ground in civil engineering projects. * Determining the dip of beds or strata, or the slope of an embankment or cutting; a kind of plumb level. * Some automotive safety systems. * Indicating pitch and roll of vehicles, nautical craft, and aircraft.

Tilt indicators are disposable-grade, albeit reusable sensors attached to goods as part of packaging during shipping. =Games= Nintendo used tilt sensor technology in five games for its Game Boy series of hand-held game systems. The tilt sensor allows players to control aspects of the game by twisting the game system. Games that use this feature: * Yoshi's Universal Gravitation (Game Boy Advance) * WarioWare: Twisted! (Game Boy Advance)(not released in Europe) * Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu! (Game Boy Advance)(Japan only) * Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble (Game Boy Color)(not released in Europe) * Command Master (Game Boy Color)(Japan only) Tilt sensors can also be found in game controllers such as the Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro and Sony's PlayStation 3 controller. However, unlike these other controllers in which the tilt sensor serves as a supplement to normal control methods, it serves as one of the central features of Nintendo's Wii Remote and the Nunchuk attachment. Along with accelerometers, the tilt sensors are a primary method of control in most Wii games. It is now being used in many different aspects, instead of just games like motocrossing and flight simulators. It can be used for sport gaming, first-person shooter, and other odd uses such as in WarioWare: Smooth Moves Another example is a virtual version of a wooden maze with obstacles in which you have to maneuver a ball by tilting the maze. A homebrew tilt sensor interface was made for the Palm (PDA).

The DIT position was created in response to the transition from the long established film movie camera medium into the current digital cinema era. The DIT is the camera department crew member who works in collaboration with the cinematographer on workflow, systemization, camera settings, signal integrity and image manipulation to achieve the highest image quality and creative goals of cinematography in the digital realm. With the progression of the digitization ever more tasks concerning data management emerged: the position of the Digital Imaging Technician was introduced. The DIT is the connector between on-set time and post production. DITs support the camera team with technical and creative tasks with the digital camera. Their purpose is to ensure the best technical quality possible, as well as production safety. DITs are responsible for tasks during preparation, on-set time and post production. They are also responsible for managing data on set, such as making backups and quality checks of the material. In post production, the DIT hands the recordings to the post production team, possibly after checking the quality of the material and generating working copies. Data backups and quality control are of great significance for the DIT who has to make sure that the original camera data and metadata is backed up at least twice daily, ensuring data integrity with checksum verification. Furthermore, the data may be backed up on LTO tape which is hardier than electronic devices and is used for long-term storage. Another copy must be made on a transfer data carrier that will be sent to post production along with the reports of the content. Again, the data has to be backed up. The data has to be accessible at all times and should be saved in a system where it can be reviewed, displaying the metadata of each clip. The DIT's role on-set has become especially prevalent through assisting cinematographers, normally accustomed to film stock, in achieving their desired look digitally. This is accomplished by the DIT through monitoring picture exposure, setting up Color Decision List (CDL) on daily basis and, if requested, \\"look up tables\\" (LUTs) for the post-production. Additionally, the DIT handles any settings in the digital camera's menu system, such as recording format and outputs. As a courtesy, the DIT also secures the digital audio recorded by the external digital audio recorder operated by the Production Sound Mixer.  Related Positions  Alongside the DIT, the data wrangler position has also been created. Data wranglers may be independent or work under a DIT. A data wrangler is another term for the role of digital loader. A data wrangler supports the camera department by managing, transferring and securing all the digital data acquired on-set via any digital cinematography cameras, interacting with the 2nd AC. Depending on the scale of the project, the DIT can also wrangle data, but never the opposite. In tradition with the classic role of film loader, the 2nd AC may alternatively take on the responsibility of data wrangling as an additional duty. A data wrangler may also be called a loader, digital loader, DMT (Data Management Technician) or film loader. Loaders usually, however, have responsibilities in addition to data wrangling, like maintaining the camera truck and completing paperwork for the camera crew. Traditional film loaders also continue to be employed on film productions where the skills of a DIT aren't applicable. Prior to the DIT position and its focus on on-set image work, several other positions, including video controllers, video shaders and video engineers performed similar functions of exposure and color control on a live video feed. While video positions still exist (especially in live broadcast and studio television), the DIT position has become commonplace in cinema, commercials and digital television.

Until 1996, when the Cumberland Gap Tunnel opened, US 58 ran only inside the commonwealth of Virginia. It was then extended southwest along a short piece of former US 25E, which no longer enters Virginia, to end at the new alignment in Tennessee. State Route 383 (SR 383) is overlaid on U.S. Route 58 in Tennessee. U.S. Route 58 is the longest numbered route in Virginia. Route description =Tennessee= US 58 begins at a trumpet interchange with US 25E, just south of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel. The route travels northeast through the outskirts of Cumberland Gap before crossing into Virginia. US 58 in Tennessee carries the designation State Route 383. =Virginia= SR 623 just east of Emporia, Virginia US 58 enters Virginia and travels east to Jonesville, where Alternate US 58 branches off and travels to the north. East of Jonesville, US 58 intersects US 421, and the two routes stay concurrent through Duffield (where the concurrency also picks up U.S. 23), Gate City, Weber City (where the US 23 concurrency ends), and Bristol, where US 58 begins a concurrency with Interstate 81. The two routes stay concurrent until I-81 exit 19 in Abingdon, where US 58 resumes its eastward journey close to the Virginia–North Carolina state line. The route is signed as the J.E.B. Stuart Highway and the A. L. Philpott Memorial Highway. Much of the highway through the region features hairpin turns, steep grades, and load- zoned bridges. US 58 begins a concurrency with US 221 in Independence, and the routes stay merged through Hillsville, just past the interchange with Interstate 77. Continuing eastward, the route crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway in the unincorporated community of Meadows of Dan before winding its way to Martinsville, where US 58 and US 220 share a southern bypass of the city. Between Stuart and the Martinsville bypass, several loops are found following the original alignment. East of Martinsville, a loop between Byrd's Store and Axton follows the original alignment, although one section west of Byrd's Store and one section east of Chatmoss remain inaccessible. Between Martinsville and Danville and between Danville and South Boston the route was widened to four lanes as part of the Arterial Highway system initiated by the Commonwealth in the mid 1960s. A newer alignment was generally just added to the older alignment. A loop of the older alignment is visible east of Brosville. Approaching Danville, US 58 once again follows an expressway bypass to the south of the city, while a business route enters the city itself. The southeastern half of this bypass is shared with US 29. East of Danville, US 29 continues north, while US 58 picks up US 360 (which begins in central Danville) and resumes its eastward journey. The routes stay cosigned until South Boston, where US 360 resumes a more northerly route to Richmond, while US 58 travels eastward to Clarksville and crosses Kerr Lake. The route crosses US Route 1 and Interstate 85 in South Hill, followed by Interstate 95 in Emporia. Near Franklin, an expressway bypass carries US 58 (and, for one stretch, US 258) south of the city, while a business route enters the city. A bypass also carries traffic around Suffolk, where US 58 begins concurrencies with US 13 and then US 460. The three US routes stay merged until an intersection with the Hampton Roads Beltway at the confluence of Interstate 64, Interstate 264, and Interstate 664. US 58 travels inside the beltway and through Portsmouth and into Norfolk via the Midtown Tunnel. The route crosses I-64 once again, and continues to Virginia Beach, roughly paralleling I-264 to its south. US 58, designated as Virginia Beach Boulevard and becoming Laskin Rd. in Virginia Beach, ends at US 60, Pacific Ave. Historically, US 58 continued for one additional block to the east, ending at Atlantic Ave., which once carried US 60 and then Business US 60. Much of the western section of US 58 is part of Crooked Road, Virginia and The Crooked Road: Virginia's Heritage Music Trail. Alternate route An alternate route of US 58, known as U.S. Route 58 Alternate (US 58 Alt.), splits from the main route in Abingdon, Virginia and travels northwest (signed west) as the \\"Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" to Coeburn. From there, US 58 Alt. travels in a southwesterly direction (signed west) through Norton, Big Stone Gap and Pennington Gap before rejoining the main route in Jonesville. History The corridor across southern Virginia was part of the initial 1918 state highway system, in which it was State Route 12. It generally followed the present U.S. 58 from Abingdon to Virginia Beach, while present US 58 west of Abingdon was part of State Route 10. These routes deviated from present US 58 in the following places: , Proposed \\"State Highway System\\" for Virginia, as Recommended by the State Roads Committee, January 1918 *SR 10 left Virginia into Kentucky at Cumberland Gap; the piece of current US 58 into Tennessee was (in general terms) State Route 107 from 1923 to 1928 and State Route 100 from 1928 to 1933 (as well as U.S. Route 25E from 1926 to 1996). *SR 10 used present U.S. Route 58 Alternate from Jonesville to Pennington Gap and U.S. 421 southeast back to U.S. 58. *SR 10 used present State Route 638 and State Route 600 from near Pattonsville to Clinchport. *SR 10 used present U.S. 421 and U.S. Route 11 through Bristol to Abingdon. From Abingdon to Meadowview, where SR 12 began, SR 10 used present State Route 609. *SR 12 used present State Route 80 and State Route 803 from Meadowview to Lodi and roughly present State Route 91 to Damascus. *From Danville to Boydton, SR 12 used present State Route 360 to near Scottsburg, U.S. Route 360 to Clover, and State Route 92 to Boydton. Present US 58 was State Route 44 (formed ca. 1930) from Danville to Clarksville, and from Clarksville to Boydton it was initially part of State Route 1, renumbered State Route 31 in the 1923 renumbering, State Route 324 from soon after 1923 to 1927, part of State Route 201 from 1927 to 1928, , page 14 and State Route 400 from 1928 to 1933. *From Suffolk to Portsmouth, SR 12 used present State Route 337.

The criteria to decide when a report must be made varies from country to country, but generally is any financial transaction that does not make sense to the financial institution; is unusual for that particular client; or appears to be done only for the purpose of hiding or obfuscating another, separate transaction. The report is filed with that country's financial crime enforcement agency, which is typically a specialist agency designed to collect and analyse transactions and then report these to relevant law enforcement. Front line staff in the financial institution have the responsibility to identify transactions that may be suspicious and these are reported to a designated person that is responsible for reporting the suspicious transaction. The financial institution is not allowed to inform the client or parties involved in the transaction that a SAR has been lodged. For example, in the United States, suspicious transaction reportsSee generally Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations sec. 1010.320. must be reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury. In Australia the SAR must be reported to Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), an Australian government agency. Most countries have laws that require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and will have a designated agency to receive them. The agency to which a report is required to be filed for a given country is typically part of the law enforcement or financial regulatory department of that country. Reporting SARs include detailed information about transactions that are or appear to be suspicious. The goal of SAR filings is to help the government identify individuals, groups and organizations involved in fraud like terrorist financing, money laundering, and other crimes. The purpose of a suspicious activity report is to detect and report known or suspected violations of law or suspicious activity observed by financial institutions subject to the regulations (for example, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)). In many instances, SARs have been instrumental in enabling law enforcement to initiate or supplement major money laundering or terrorist financing investigations and other criminal cases. Information provided in SAR forms also presents FinCEN with a method of identifying emerging trends and patterns associated with financial crimes. The information about those trends and patterns is vital to law enforcement agencies and provides valuable feedback to financial institutions. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), financial institutions are required to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering, such as:  Keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments,  File reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and  Report suspicious activity that might signal criminal activity (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion) Link to the Website: https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bank- operations/financial-crime/suspicious-activity-reports/index-suspicious- activity-reports.html Each SAR must be filed within 30 days of the date of the initial determination for the necessity of filing the report. An extension of 30 days can be obtained if the identity of the person conducting the suspicious activity is not known. At no time, however, should the filing of an SAR be delayed longer than 60 days. The Bank Secrecy Act specifies that each firm must maintain records of its SARs for a period of five years from the date of filing. Reporters The report can start with any employee of a financial service. The employees are generally trained to be alert for suspicious activity, such as situations where people are trying to wire money out of the country without identification, or activity by someone with no job who starts depositing large amounts of cash into an account. Employees are trained to communicate their suspicion up their chain of command where further decisions are made about whether to file a report or not. Many different types of finance-related industries are required to file SARs. These include: * depository institutions (for example, banks and credit unions) * securities and futures dealers (for example, stock brokers and mutual fund brokers) * money services businesses (for example, check cashing services, currency exchange bureaus, and money order providers) * casinos and card clubs * dealers in precious metals and gems (for example, jewelry dealers) * insurance companies * mortgage companies and brokers Other related forms There are other forms that FinCEN requires businesses and individuals to file. These include: * individuals who transport more than $10,000 in currency into or out of the United States * shippers and receivers involved in the transfer of $10,000 in currency into or out of the United States * businesses that receive more than $10,000 in currency in a single transaction or in related transactions * people who have control over more than $10,000 in financial accounts outside of the U.S. during a calendar year Confidentiality Unauthorized disclosure of a SAR filing is a federal criminal offense., , Financial institutions undertake an investigation process prior to filing a SAR to ensure that the information reported is appropriate, complete, and accurate. This process will often include review by financial investigators, management and/or attorneys prior to filing. To encourage complete candor and cooperation, there are disclosure and evidentiary privileges that protect SAR filers. First, an individual or organization is precluded from discovering the existence or contents of a SAR that includes the individual or organization's name. SARs filers are immune from the discovery process.Union Bank of California v. Superior Court, 130 Cal. App. 4th 378, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 894 (2005) Second, SAR filers enjoy immunity for all statements made in their SARs, regardless of whether those statements were allegedly made in bad faith.Lee v. Bankers Trust Co., 166 F.3d 540 (2d Cir. 1999)Stoutt v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 320 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 2003). SAR filing options Effective July 1, 2012 all SAR Reports must be filed through FinCEN's BSA E-filing System. A SAR has five sections each containing information about the filing institution or the activity in question: ; Part I - Subject Information : Any name, address, social security or tax ID's, birth date, drivers license numbers, passport numbers, occupation and phone numbers of all parties involved with the activity. ; Part II - Suspicious Activity Information : Date Range and codes for the type of Suspicious Activity ; Part III - Information about Financial Institution where Activity Occurred : ; Part IV - Filing Institution Contact Information : Usually contains the contact information for the financial institution's compliance officer or equivalent and list of any law enforcement agency that has been contacted while investigating the activity.. ; Part V - Suspicious Activity Information - Narrative : A written description of the activity. Penalties for non-compliance Financial institutions and their employees face civil and criminal penalties for failing to properly file suspicious activity reports, including any combination of large fines, regulatory restrictions, loss of banking charter, or imprisonment. History The requirement to file suspicious activity reports (as well as the accompanying implied gag order) was added by Section 1517(b) of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act (part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, , , 4060).

In addition, U.S. 63 from Jonesboro (including the U.S. 49 concurrency) to Turrell is now designated as Interstate 555, which involved building service roads and a few other upgrades to interstate standards. It has been questioned as to whether or not U.S. 63 will be rerouted to eliminate the dogleg from Jonesboro to West Memphis to Hazen. Possible reroutings could be U.S. 63/49 from Jonesboro to Brinkley and U.S. 63/70 from Brinkley to Hazen or U.S. 63/AR 1 from Jonesboro to Forrest City and U.S. 63/70 from Forrest City to Hazen. =Missouri= Jefferson City Bridge The highway passes south-to-north through Missouri, from Arkansas to Iowa, serving cities such as Rolla, Jefferson City, Columbia, Moberly, Macon, and Kirksville. Notable routes that are intersected include U.S. Route 60 in Howell County, Interstate 44 at Rolla, U.S. Route 50 (which it shares a concurrency with into Jefferson City south of the Missouri River until it reaches the junction with U.S. 54), U.S. Route 54 (which it overlaps in Jefferson City from the junction with U.S. Route 50 and crosses the Missouri River with on the Jefferson City Bridge), Interstate 70 at Columbia, U.S. Route 24 at Moberly, U.S. Route 36 at Macon, and U.S. Route 136 at Lancaster. Stonehenge next to U.S. Route 63 U.S. 63 in Missouri was Route 7 from 1922 to 1926. =Iowa= U.S. 63 passes south-to-north through Iowa. It enters the state from Missouri south of Bloomfield. Between Ottumwa and Oskaloosa, the highway overlaps Iowa Highway 163. This segment is an expressway which connects Des Moines with Burlington, with freeway bypasses of Ottumwa and Eddyville. Near Malcom, U.S. 63 meets Interstate 80. Only a few miles later, it joins U.S. 6 westbound for several miles near Grinnell, then goes north again. At Toledo, it intersects U.S. 30 and at Waterloo, U.S. 63 meets U.S. 20. An expressway section opened in October 2012, completing the four-lane link between Waterloo and New Hampton. The highway enters Minnesota just north of Chester. =Minnesota= U.S. 63 enters Minnesota from Iowa south of Spring Valley. After meeting Interstate 90, U.S. 63 serves the local airport and then intersects with U.S. Route 52. In this area, U.S. 63 is an expressway, but plans are to upgrade the highway to a freeway between Stewartville and the U.S. 52 interchange. In 2014, U.S. 63 was rerouted around downtown Rochester, running concurrently with U.S. 52 to 75th St NW, jutting back to the east to the existing route. North of Rochester, the highway meets U.S. Route 61 at Lake City. From there, the two routes run concurrent to Red Wing, where U.S. 63 turns north and crosses the Mississippi River to enter Wisconsin over the Eisenhower Bridge. The Minnesota section of U.S. 63 is defined as Routes 59 and 161 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(92). =Wisconsin= Main article: U.S. Route 63 in Wisconsin U.S. 63 enters Wisconsin south of Hager City. Near Baldwin, U.S. 63 intersects Interstate 94. The highway briefly overlaps near Spooner with U.S. Route 53. At Trego, they separate and U.S. 63 runs southwest to northeast, passing through Hayward & Cable most notably, and ending near Ashland at U.S. Route 2. History Though US 63 as a stand-alone highway had always ended at Turrell, Arkansas before the 1999 extension, in the past it was concurrent with US 61/US 64/US 70/US 79 (and later I-55) on into Memphis, Tennessee, over the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge. Unlike the 1999 extension, this concurrency to Memphis was generally in line with the rest of US 63\\\\. Though some maps continued to show this concurrency until 1999, Arkansas had not recognized US 63 south of Turrell for many years, since at least the 1960s.

The network was dedicated to motorsports programming, including auto racing, as well as automotive-focused programs. Although the channel was based in the United States (its headquarters were located at University Research Park in Charlotte, North Carolina), Speed ceased being available to most American viewers as a standalone network with its own original programming on August 17, 2013, when it was replaced by the general-interest sports network Fox Sports 1.Fox Reveals Details of New National Sports Network, Variety, March 5, 2013. An \\"international\\" version of the network, now known as Fox Sports Racing, concurrently launched in Canada, the Caribbean and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico to replace the domestic feed, airing archived Speed programming and live simulcasts of motorsports events carried by Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2 in the United States that would be otherwise unavailable to international viewers. When it originally launched in 1995 as Speedvision, the network carried a lineup featuring programs profiling the automobile and motorsports industries (including individual companies, vehicles and teams), how-to series, and coverage of various domestic and international racing series (such as the Formula One World Championship, Rolex Sports Car Series, and the American Le Mans Series). After it was acquired by News Corporation in 2001 and relaunched as Speed Channel, the network's programming became increasingly NASCAR-oriented; prior to its shutdown in the U.S., Speed's lineup consisted mostly of automotive-themed reality shows, NASCAR-related programs (including coverage of practice and qualifying sessions, and full coverage of the Camping World Truck Series), along with news programs focusing on motorsports. Most of Speed's live event programming was carried over to Fox Sports 1 (or sister network Fox Sports 2), and is simulcast on the Speed network that remains available outside the U.S. Due to contractual changes associated with the relaunch, Fox was expected to temporarily distribute a version of Speed (separate from the international version) to fulfill contracts with providers that had not yet signed deals to carry Fox Sports 1, airing a loop of the network's past reality programming. Many of the programs once found on Speed can now be found in the United States on CBS Sports Network, MAVTV and Velocity (such as Gearz, My Classic Car, Chop Cut Rebuild, and Dream Car Garage as well as live coverage of racing events), others not such as Speed Center. History =As Speedvision= The network originally launched as Speedvision on December 31, 1995. It was founded by Roger L. Werner, E. Roger Williams, Nickolas Rhodes, and Robert Scanlon; the network's original ownership included cable providers Cox Communications, Continental Cablevision, and AT&T; Corporation. Speedvision's initial lineup featured various automotive programs, including various documentary-style series focusing on prolific vehicles, manufacturers, and racing teams (such as Victory by Design and Legends of Motorsport), series focusing on classic automobiles (such as Dream Car Garage, coverage of Barrett-Jackson's auctions, and My Classic Car, which moved to the network from TNN), an AutoWeek-branded television series, along with MotorWeek and Autoline Detroit – two programs respectively syndicated from PBS member stations in Maryland and Detroit. Speedvision also carried coverage of various minor and professional auto racing series, including the Sports Car Club of America's World Challenge series (of which it also acquired title sponsorship of in 1999, becoming the Speedvision World Challenge). =Fox acquisition and NASCAR push= In the summer of 2001, the Fox Entertainment Group (then a subsidiary of News Corporation) purchased a 30% ownership interest in Speedvision. In August of that year, Fox negotiated a deal to acquire the stakes held by Cox and Comcast, thus giving them majority control of the network. Since Fox Sports had recently acquired broadcast rights to the first half of the NASCAR Busch and Winston Cup Series in a six-year deal, Fox planned to leverage Speedvision as an outlet for supplemental NASCAR programming. To coincide with that year's running of the Daytona 500, Speedvision was relaunched as Speed Channel on February 11, 2002; the network's operations were also relocated from Stamford, Connecticut to Charlotte, North Carolina (where NASCAR and the majority of its teams are based). In the following years, additional NASCAR-related programs were slowly brought on to the schedule, ranging from news programs (such as Totally NASCAR, rerun from Fox Sports Net, and NASCAR Race Hub), pre-race programs Trackside and NASCAR RaceDay, and the post-race NASCAR Victory Lane. Speed Channel also added a weekly call-in show in 2003, WindTunnel with Dave Despain, which featured interviews and discussions relating to news and events in auto racing. NASCAR Busch (now Xfinity) Series driver Shane Huffman, answers questions from Speed Channel's Dick Berggren. Starting in 2003, Speed began to carry NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series, after buying out the remainder of ESPN2's contract for the events. The channel also offered coverage of practices and qualifying races in NASCAR's main national series, the Gatorade Duels qualifying races, and the Sprint All-Star Race. In 2005, the channel's name was shortened to simply Speed. Until late 2007, Speed also aired coverage of International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation events over the winter months – including bobsledding, luge and skeleton. Its winter sports coverage also included an annual charity bobsledding event organized by NASCAR driver and bobsled builder Geoff Bodine, which featured participation by various NASCAR drivers. Universal Sports acquired the rights to FIBT events beginning in the 2007–08 season. Speed continued to maintain coverage of other professional racing series, such as the Rolex Sports Car Series (including the 24 Hours of Daytona), the American Le Mans Series (along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans), the newly renamed Speed World Challenge until 2010, and the Formula One World Championship. By the mid 2000s, these came along with an increasing number of reality series (such as the street racing-inspired Pinks, Unique Whips, Chop Cut Rebuild, the drag racing game show Pass Time, American Trucker, and Hard Parts: South Bronx, along with reruns of the MTV series Pimp My Ride). By 2008, Speed was carried in over 73 million households. In 2010, Fox launched Speed 2, a TV Everywhere video streaming service which featured coverage of additional racing series not broadcast by Speed, along with video on demand access to archived Speed programs. The service was shut down in 2014. In 2011, Speed began carrying Australia's V8 Supercars series; it also aired live coverage of the Gold Coast 600 (where major international drivers competed in teams alongside Australian drivers) and the Bathurst 1000 featuring Darrell Waltrip, Mike Joy, Leigh Diffey, and Calvin Fish on-location. The move was met with praise from series organizers, who felt that the series could benefit from the additional exposure it would receive from American coverage—the series would also add a U.S. event at Austin's Circuit of the Americas for the 2013 season. On October 12, 2012, Fox Sports announced that it would not renew its contract to air Formula One racing on Speed after the conclusion of the 2012 season. Two days later, NBC Sports announced that it had reached a new four-year deal to broadcast F1 races beginning in the 2013 season, with the majority of its coverage to be carried by NBC Sports Network. Three days later, Fox Sports reached an agreement with NASCAR to extend the network's broadcasting contract through the 2022 season (maintaining its rights to the first half of the Sprint Cup season and the full Camping World Truck Series season), along with the addition of online streaming rights beginning in 2013. Shutdown of Speed and relaunch as Fox Sports 1 On March 5, 2013, Fox Sports announced that Speed would be shut down and replaced by a new mainstream sports channel known as Fox Sports 1; the network was to inherit Speed's NASCAR coverage (which would be expanded under a new television deal in 2015 to add coverage of selected Sprint Cup Series and Nationwide Series events), but joined by new or recently acquired sports rights, including college basketball and football, Major League Soccer, UFC, and new studio programming. Sister channel Fuel TV was also being re-launched as a companion, Fox Sports 2. The last program to be broadcast by Speed in the United States was a replay of qualifying for that weekend's Sprint Cup event, the Pure Michigan 400, which was soon followed by a statement from Fox NASCAR play-by- play announcer Mike Joy marking the end of Speed's operations in the United States: Although Fox marketed the transition to Fox Sports 1 as a re-launch of Speed, Fox was required to re-negotiate carriage deals with providers for Fox Sports 1 due to the change of its nature of service. There was uncertainty over whether Fox Sports 1 would have sufficient carriage at launch, as it had not yet reached deals with three of the four largest pay television providers in the United States (these being DirecTV, Dish Network and Time Warner Cable) with only a month before its launch. However, all three finally agreed to terms to carry Fox Sports 1 three days before the scheduled launch. For any remaining television providers that did not reach a deal, Fox offered a \\"watered-down\\" version of Speed (which consisted of a loop of the network's reality programming and no live events) to fulfill existing carriage contracts until they reached a deal to carry Fox Sports 1. In international markets such as Canada, a Speed-branded service was maintained (now known as Fox Sports Racing) running an automated loop of Speed's previous non-event programming, and simulcasts of motorsports programming carried by Fox Sports 1 or 2. Speed's former Formula One commentators record a panel discussion at the 2006 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (left to right – Derek Daly, Peter Windsor, Bob Varsha, David Hobbs, Sam Posey, Steve Matchett). Despite the channel’s shutdown, the Speed brand continues to be used on Fox Sports’ social media platforms for coverage of AMA Supercross, the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series, the ARCA Racing Series, International Motor Sports Association, and other non-NASCAR motorsports. International versions =North America (outside the United States)= Speed became available in Canada shortly after its U.S. launch. As Speedvision, Speed was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to be added to its list of foreign cable networks approved for carriage on Canadian cable and satellite providers in 1997. As such, Speed is carried by most Canadian television service providers. Prior to August 2013, Canadian viewers saw a largely identical schedule as the U.S. channel, although some programming, particularly live Formula 1 events, were blacked out to protect TSN, which holds domestic broadcast rights to F1 events (under CRTC rules, foreign services must own Canadian broadcast rights to the content they air). However, this point became moot when NBC Sports Network obtained rights to F1 events beginning with the 2013 season, as that network is not available in Canada. In Canada, as well as the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, Speed was not converted to Fox Sports 1. The exact reasons for this have not been confirmed, although in the case of Canada, it is not clear whether Fox would have had the ability to make such a change given that Speed's Canadian authorization was based on it being a motorsports-based network. The version of Speed available in these areas continues to carry various NASCAR and other motorsports events, as well as related studio programming, mostly simulcast with their U.S. broadcasts on Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2, but does not otherwise originate any new programming of its own. During hours when the network is not simulcasting FS1 or FS2 coverage, it carries repeats of past events and Speed's previous reality and documentary programming. The international feed does not carry commercial advertising: commercial breaks consist solely of promos for its programming, with no outside advertising aside from public service announcements and promotions inserted by local providers. In early 2014, major Canadian service providers including Rogers Cable and Bell Satellite TV began to drop the service upon the expiration of their carriage contracts. Cogeco dropped the Speed Channel on July 15, 2014. Shaw later announced they will drop Speed on April 1, 2015 within their cable and satellite system (a.k.a. Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct). Reports indicate that Fox had attempted to raise the channel's carriage fees significantly, despite the major reductions in original programming for international viewers, and Rogers suggests Fox was unwilling to allow Speed to be moved to a more specialized package in light of the programming and cost changes. On February 19, 2015, Fox announced that the international feed of Speed would be re- branded as Fox Sports Racing, and announced that Rogers had reached a deal to add the rebranded network back to its lineup. =Former= Australia Speed launched in Australia on November 1, 2010 on Foxtel in both standard and high definition. After months of negotiations and controversy, on March 25, 2011, Speed and Speed HD launched on subscription the television provider Austar. Among other racing events, the Australian network airs NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Nationwide Series, Camping World Truck Series, V8 Supercars and Superbike World Championship. The network also has its own version of Speed News. Unlike the U.S. version, it is owned by Fox Sports Pty Limited, a subsidiary of News Corp Australia – which is no longer directly connected to 21st Century Fox due to its inclusion in the split of News Corporation. Speed closed on November 3, 2014 and has been replaced by Fox Sports 5. Latin America The Latin American version of Speed carried live coverage of the Sprint Cup Series, Nationwide Series, Rolex Sports Car Series, American Le Mans Series (including 24 Hours of Le Mans), Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and the Camping World Truck Series. It also aired delayed coverage of the World Series by Renault and NASCAR Mexico. Other programming included highlights shows including British Formula Three Championship, the Argentine TC 2000 and Turismo Carretera, and the Colombian T.C. 2000 and delayed highlights of Australia's V8 Supercars, FIA GT (airing on a few months delay), AMA Supercross and Monster Jam, as well as non-motorsport programs such as Grand Prix on Track, Grand Prix Story, Unique Whips, Tuner Mania and Pinks. On February 5, 2012, the Latin American channel was replaced in Brazil by a domestic version of Fox Sports. Beginning in 2012, the network broadcast Formula 1 free practices and live and delayed qualifying events and races, as well as live races from the GP2 Series and GP3 Series. On November 5, 2012, Speed Latin America was relaunched as Fox Sports 3, whose programming remains focused on motorsports, especially on weekends.

In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Cheerios is marketed by Cereal Partners under the Nestlé brand; in Australia and New Zealand, Cheerios is sold as an Uncle Tobys product. It was first manufactured in 1941 as CheeriOats. History Cheerios was introduced on May 1, 1941, as \\"CheeriOats\\". The name was shortened to \\"Cheerios\\" in 1945. Its production was based upon the extrusion process invented for Kix in 1937. In 1976, \\"Cinnamon Nut Cheerios\\" was the first departure from the original flavor of Cheerios, over 30 years after the cereal was created; the second was \\"Honey Nut Cheerios\\", introduced in 1979. General Mills sold approximately 1.8 million cases of Honey Nut Cheerios in its first year. Ingredients In January 2014, General Mills announced that it would halt the use of genetically modified ingredients in original Cheerios. In February 2015, the company announced that it would be making Cheerios totally gluten-free by removing the traces of wheat, rye, and barley that usually come into contact with the oat supply used to make Cheerios during transportation to the General Mills plant in Buffalo, New York along Lake Erie. Advertising Many television commercials for Cheerios have targeted children, featuring animated characters (such as a Honeybee). Bullwinkle was featured in early 1960s commercials, with the tag line at the end of the ad being \\"Go with Cheerios!\\" followed by Bullwinkle, usually worse for wear due to his Cheerios-inspired bravery somewhat backfiring, saying \\"...but watch where you're going!\\" Hoppity Hooper was also featured in ads in the mid-1960s; General Mills was the primary sponsor of his animated program. From 1969 to 1972, the Cheerios kid and Sue encounter a villain and flee from it and the Cheerios kid pours the cereal into a bowl and the jingle \\"Get yourself go\\" plays. The Cheerios go into a spiral and into the Kid's muscles then the Kid and Sue escape and track down the villain and the Cheerios kid says his catchphrase \\"Get Cheerios.\\" The jingle borrows the tune of The Monkees's \\"I’m a Believer\\" and \\"A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You\\" which were released 3 years prior. =The Cheerios Kid= Beginning in the mid-1950s and continuing through the early 1960s, \\"The Cheerios Kid\\" was a mainstay in Cheerios commercials. The Kid, after eating Cheerios, quickly dealt with whatever problem presented in the commercial, using oat-produced \\"Big-G, little-o\\" \\"Go-power.\\" The character was revived briefly in the late 1980s in similar commercials. In 2012, The Cheerios Kid and sidekick Sue were revived in an internet video that showed how Cheerios \\"can lower cholesterol.\\" Video clips of \\"the Kid\\" and Sue are part of a montage included in a 2014 TV commercial, along with clips of the Honey Nut Cheerios bee's early commercials. =Peanuts= In 1984 and 1985, characters from the comic strip Peanuts were featured in many Cheerios commercials. In the commercials, the characters become tired at the middle of something (e.g. a dance lesson, playing tennis), but then another character tells them that they didn't have a healthy Cheerios breakfast. Then, at the end of the commercial, the character would be energized, followed by children singing \\"You're on your toes with Cheerios!\\" =Spoonfuls of Stories= The Spoonfuls of Stories program, begun in 2002, is sponsored by Cheerios and a 50/50 joint venture of General Mills and Simon & Schuster. Mini-sized versions of Simon & Schuster children's books are published within the program when the book drive occurs. The program also includes a New Author contest; winners' books are published in miniature inside boxes of Cheerios. =Shawn Johnson= In 2009, Olympic gold medalist and World Champion gymnast Shawn Johnson became the first athlete to have her photo featured on the front of the Cheerios box. The limited edition was distributed in the Midwestern region of the United States by the Hy-Vee grocery store chain. =Just Checking= In 2013, a Cheerios commercial aired, titled \\"Just Checking,\\" showcasing an interracial family in which a daughter asks her mother (white) if Cheerios is good for the heart, as her father (black) mentioned. The mother says the cereal is good according to the box which states that the whole grain oats lower cholesterol. The next scene features the father waking up as a pile of Cheerios spill down his chest, which the daughter placed there having taken her father's words literally. The commercial received unintentional notoriety due to the racist anger at the commercial showing a biracial family. This was so extreme that General Mills disabled further comments on the video. In 2014, General Mills released a Super Bowl ad titled \\"Gracie,\\" featuring the same family: in the commercial, the father, using Cheerios to illustrate his meaning, tells the daughter that a new baby is coming, that her mother is pregnant, and the daughter accepts – as long as they also get a puppy and the father agrees while the mother looks a little surprised. =Vortexx= To promote the premiere of the Vortexx Saturday morning block on The CW Television Network in August 2012, special boxes of Cheerios were branded as \\"Vortexx O's,\\" complete with the schedule on the back, and the wordmark plastered on one of the Vortexx promotional backgrounds. Toys were also included in the box, featuring John Cena, Iron Man, and the Pink Power Ranger. =Good Goes Around= In 2017, Latrell James was hired to sing a song for a new Cheerios commercial, with the refrain \\"Good goes around and around and around.\\" =Murray the Brave= In May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada it partnered with Food Banks Canada to do a tribute to food bank workers.

A clinical study > showed that eating two 1½ cup servings daily of Cheerios cereal reduced bad > cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet low in saturated fat and > cholesterol.\\" The FDA letter indicated that General Mills needed to change the way it marketed Cheerios or apply for federal approval to sell Cheerios as a drug. General Mills responded with a statement that their claim of soluble fiber content had been approved by the FDA, and that claims about lowering cholesterol had been featured on the box for two years. In 2012, the FDA followed up with a letter approving the Cheerios labeling and declaring that the matter was moot and required no further action.

Early life and education Sproule was born to James and Jane (née Mitchell) Sproule, farmers who had emigrated to King Township, Canada West from County of Tyrone, Ireland.http://data2.collectionscanada.gc.ca/e/e094/e002346395.jpg His parents moved to Grey County when he was young, and he attended public schools there before studying at University of Michigan and Victoria University in Cobourg. He left school for two years before returning to Victoria University, graduating in 1868 with a degree in medicine. Doctor, businessman, politician and husband Knarsboro Hall, Markdale.After graduation, Sproule first practised medicine at Craighurst, Ontario before moving to Galesburg, Michigan. He moved back to Grey County, settling in Markdale, Ontario, where in addition to his medical practice, he also opened a drug store, bought a large cattle farm, and invested in local businesses such as a flour mill and lumber yard. He turned to politics and succeeded the retiring William Kingston Flesher as MP of Grey East in the 1878 election as a Conservative MP. He also fell in love with Flesher's daughter, Mary Alice, and wooed her by having a beautiful Italianate house that he called Knarsboro Hall built for her in Markdale. The couple was married in 1881, and had a daughter, Lillian. T.S. Sproule was also related to the famous NHL Toronto St. Patricks owner Harvey Sproule. T.S. Sproule's niece was Mary Elizabeth Sproule Head, of Milton, Ontario, who along with her husband John Head, cared for her young nephew Harvey Sproule and his sister.http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2493114/page/2 Sproule was subsequently re-elected to Parliament eight times in succession. Both Sproule and his wife were dedicated teetotallers and Prohibitionists, and when Mary Alice Sproule was the hostess of her husband's political functions, she never allowed alcohol to be served. Political views Sproule was a staunch Protestant from an Irish Unionist background. He was a member of the Orange Order, and rose to the position of \\"Master and Sovereign\\". In 1906, he became \\"President of the Imperial Grand Council of the World\\". The Order was noted for its anti-French and anti-Catholic views, particularly in that period. As a Conservative MP, he was a supporter of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, but his loyalty to Orangeism led him to differ with his party's leadership on issues of language and religion, particularly on the Manitoba Schools Question. Sproule opposed any concession to Catholic Separate Schools or French language instruction. Following the fall of the Conservative government in the 1896 election, largely due to divisions over the school issue, he became a pronounced critic of the immigration policies of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government. Sproule opposed the admission to Canada of non- British migrants. He supported the abolition of French language instruction in Ontario schools, and the implementation of Regulation 17. Sproule also opposed the expansion of French language services by the federal government. Speaker of the House Following the defeat of the Laurier government in the 1911 election, the new Conservative Prime Minister, Robert Laird Borden, nominated Sproule to the position of Speaker of the House of Commons. Because Sproule had to lead the House in prayers in both English and French, he embarked on French lessons despite being a lifelong opponent of the language. During a thirty-six-day filibuster on the question of the government's naval bill, Sproule lost his patience after weeks of 24-hour sessions, and became the first Speaker ever to \\"name\\" a member of the House for disorderly conduct. Illness and death Sproule was forced to retire from the Speakership due to ill health, and was named to the Senate of Canada in 1915. He served for two years until his death in 1917. Four years after his death, Sproule's wife Mary Alice sold Knarsboro Hall, the house Sproule had built for her, and went to live with her daughter where she stayed until her death in 1941.

He has released eight studio albums. Early life Growing up in Bergen suburb, Lerche was heavily influenced by 1980s pop. Lerche was fascinated by bands such as The Beatles, A-ha, The Beach Boys, and Prefab Sprout, and began formal guitar instruction at age eight. Not being satisfied with classical lessons, Lerche's teacher introduced him to Brazilian music (such as Bossa Nova) and thus formed the foundation of Lerche's vast array of complex melodies and chords throughout his music today. At age fourteen, Lerche penned his first song, \\"Locust Girl.\\" Lerche performed acoustic gigs at the club where his sister worked while he was still under age. Norwegian producer H.P. Gundersen \\"discovered\\" Lerche, and began to mentor him, exposing him to diverse music genres, including psychedelia, 1960s pop, and mainstream Brazilian music. Career Lerche met with Oslo-based manager Tatiana Penzo, leading up to a deal with Virgin Norway signed in 2000. His popularity in his home country increased steadily, and in 2000 he recorded his debut album, Faces Down. Faces Down was not released until 2001, after Lerche finished schooling. In the interim, he was named Best New Act at the Norwegian Grammys (Spellemannprisen) and performed locally in support of major acts such as Beth Orton. Faces Down was officially released in Norway in September 2001 and gradually throughout all of Europe. Lerche toured with various acts, including his long-time idols, a-ha, in Oslo. Autumn 2002 saw the release of Faces Down in America and Lerche's first major tour of the United States. Faces Down was a hit in Norway and received critical praise in Norway and the United States — Rolling Stone Magazine placed it in their top 50 albums of 2002. He released the live/studio collection Don't Be Shallow EP the following year. In 2003, he toured with another one of his musical heroes, Elvis Costello (they toured together once again in 2005). Lerche in 2004 In 2004 his second album was released, Two Way Monologue, also produced by Gundersen. The album displayed more of Lerche's ability to span many different styles—from pop-like and upbeat tracks to more mellow or melodic tunes. It was very well received, with positive reviews in Rolling Stone and Pitchfork. Devon Powers of Popmatters praised Sondre's \\"contagious musical sensibilities, exhilarating vigor and downright stupefying songcraft,\\" and noted that \\"Lerche manages to both push himself and maintain an allegiance to his ways – something artists twice his age have trouble doing.\\" On 27 February 2006, Duper Sessions was released. The jazz album was recorded in the fall of 2005 with his band the Faces Down and pianist Erik Halvorsen at Duper Studios in Bergen. The album reached No. 21 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. His February 2007 release, Phantom Punch, is a rock album with a more aggressive sound than his previous work. Lerche and the Faces Down recorded and mixed the album in Los Angeles in April and May 2006, with producer Tony Hoffer. In September 2009, Lerche released Heartbeat Radio, to critical acclaim. While it maintained the studio polish of his groundbreaking debut, there was also a sense of musical adventure that mixed acoustic guitars with grand gestures of orchestral pop, elements of 1950s Jazz, 1960s and 1970s Brazilian psych-folk, and state-of-the-art 1980s pop masters such as Prefab Sprout, Scritti Politti and Fleetwood Mac. In his review, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"No matter what genre he's working in – fuzzy garage rock, breezy vocal jazz, acoustic folk-pop – this young Norwegian singer-songwriter crafts catchier choruses than many musicians who’ve been working twice as long as he has.\\" Allmusic Guide's Tim Sendra called Heartbeat Radio Sondre's \\"best work to date.\\" In June 2011, Lerche released the self-titled Sondre Lerche, on his own Mona Records. Praised by Rolling Stone, The New York Times, Stereogum, Filter, Spin, and Entertainment Weekly among others for its experimentation with contrasting musical sounds, this eponymous album contains Lerche's most interesting arrangements and catchy songwriting to date, but also some of his most somber and introspective. In the studio, Lerche wanted to explore his new creative alliances in Williamsburg, the Brooklyn neighborhood where he's lived on and off for the previous six years. The album was recorded – live in the studio – and mixed in a short but intense time period of three weeks. The sessions included fellow musicians – Midlake drummer McKenzie Smith, longtime producer/collaborator Kato Ådland, Dave Heilman (drummer for Regina Spektor), and co-producer, mixer, and owner of Rare Book Room Studio, Nicolas Verhnes (Spoon, Animal Collective). Lerche in 2012 Lerche celebrated his 30th birthday with the release of his first live album, Bootlegs, in 2012. Lerche wrote and recorded Please following his divorce from Mona Fastvold. The album, known as his \\"divorce record\\", was released on 23 September 2014 on Mona Records. \\"Bad Law\\" was released as the main single for the album in June 2014. On 3 March 2017, Lerche released his eighth studio album, Pleasure, on the PLZ label. On 24 November that year the songs from Pleasure were also released in a stripped down solo version titled Solo Pleasure. Solo Pleasure was released digitally on 14 February 2018. Personal life In July 2005, Lerche married Norwegian model, actress, and director Mona Fastvold. They divorced in 2013. Was in a relationship with writer and blogger Linnéa Myhre from 2013 to 2020.

The river has been known as the Shiré or Chire River. It is the only outlet of Lake Malawi and flows into the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Its length is . The upper Shire River issues from Lake Malawi and runs approximately 12 miles before it enters shallow Lake Malombe. It then drains Lake Malombe and flows south through Liwonde National Park where large concentrations of hippopotamus are common along its shores. Between the towns of Matope and Chikwawa, the middle river drops approximately 1,300 feet through a series of falls and gorges, including Kapachira Falls. Two hydroelectric dams have been built along the Shire northwest of Blantyre. Beyond Chikwawa, the lower river turns southeast and enters the low-lying Mozambique plain. Its largest and one of its few perennial tributaries, the Ruo River, joins the Shire near the Malawian town of Chiromo. The muddy waters pass through a large stagnant area known as the Elephant Marsh before reaching the confluence with the Zambezi River south of the town of Sena, Mozambique.

The western terminus is at U.S. Route 160 in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona. The highway's eastern terminus is at NC 12 and U.S. Route 158 at Whalebone Junction, North Carolina. Route description =Arizona and New Mexico= US 64's western terminus is Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, at US 160. It goes southeast from Teec Nos Pos and enters New Mexico. US 64 runs through Farmington, Taos, Angel Fire, Eagle Nest, Cimarron, and Raton. As it runs through Raton, it is co-signed with U.S. Route 87. It continues through to Clayton, where US 87 is replaced by U.S. Routes 56 and 412. The three routes then run concurrently into Oklahoma. northeast of Cimarron is Raton Municipal Airport. It is one of the roads on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.Trail of the Ancients. New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014. At Angel Fire, US 64 runs past the Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park. Although US 64 does not technically cross into Texas, the New Mexico-Texas border does reach the shoulder of US 64 outside of Clayton at . =Oklahoma= Heading into the Oklahoma Panhandle, the three conjoined routes pick up a fourth two miles (3 km) southwest of Boise City, as US-385 merges from the south. In Boise City, US-385 departs to the north along with U.S. 287, which replaces US-385 in the four-way concurrency on the way out of town to the east, before departing itself to the southeast two miles (3 km) outside of town. Shortly thereafter, US-56 also departs the route, heading northeast into Kansas, while US-64 and US-412 continue their journey due east toward Guymon. Near Guymon, the route turns due south to approach the town. US-412 then heads due east, while US-64 veers from due south to northeast, joining up with US-54. These two routes remain together for about , splitting at Hooker, with US-54 continuing northeast into Kansas while US-64 again veers due east. At Turpin, US-64 turns left, running north with US-83; three miles (5 km) later, it again turns east, joining US-270 while US-83 and westbound US-270 continue north to Liberal, Kansas. to the east, US-270 departs to the south, and US-64 finally runs solo for a significant stretch save for very short concurrencies with US-283 near Rosston, US-183 through Buffalo, and US-281 in Alva. Near Pond Creek, US-64 turns south, joined by US-60 and US-81. US-64 splits off just north of Enid, jogging through the city before rejoining US-412 on the east side of town. The two routes remain together until they meet Interstate 35, which US-64 joins briefly southbound while US-412 continues east, becoming the Cimarron Turnpike. US-64 departs I-35 at Perry, intersecting the parallel US-77 before continuing east. On either side of Morrison the route intersects US-177 and US-412 (again) before passing through Pawnee and Cleveland. It then veers southeast, rejoining US-412 yet again to head into Tulsa. In downtown Tulsa, the route diverges from US-412 for the final time. It briefly (and separately) is concurrent with Interstate 244 and US-75 before bearing southeast through the city while joining OK-51 , intersecting Interstate 44 before briefly joining the southernmost five miles (8 km) of US-169, disjoining OK-51 running southbound on the eastern edge of the city. It then proceeds south, crossing the Creek Turnpike, then crosses the Arkansas River in Bixby before turning to the southeast. After passing through Haskell, US-64 and US-62 meet head-on, north–south; they join and head east toward Muskogee. The routes disengage at the intersection with US-69, with US-64 bearing south out of the center of town. At Warner, the route turns eastward again, where it will run parallel to Interstate 40 for the remainder of its path through Oklahoma. It passes through Webbers Falls, Gore, Vian, Sallisaw (where it has a brief concurrence with US-59), Muldrow, and Roland before leaving the state. =Arkansas= Highway 64 in London The route enters Arkansas in Fort Smith and crosses the Arkansas River. The route continues following Interstate 40 through Clarksville, Russellville, and Conway, where I-40 turns south and US 64 continues east. US 64 runs with US 67 and US 167 (Future Interstate 57) near Searcy before passing through rural Eastern Arkansas fields. US 64 runs east to Marion and West Memphis, where it meets I-40 and Interstate 55 to continue east over the Mississippi River on the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge to Memphis, Tennessee. A segment of US 64 in Crittenden County is also known as Military Road and is the oldest road in the state. It was surveyed for the removal of Native Tribes known of as the Trail of Tears. A historical marker in Marion notes this information. =Tennessee= US-64 enters Tennessee on the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge at Memphis. The route shares the bridge with Interstate 55 and U.S. Routes 61, 70, and 79. The route traverses several streets in Memphis before becoming a rural divided highway in eastern Shelby County. The highway runs directly to the east through the county seats of Tennessee's most southern counties. US 64 then continues on past Lawrenceburg, the largest city on the State line between Memphis and Interstate 65, to Chattanooga. then US 64 runs from Chattanooga to Cleveland, where it duplexes with US 74 to the North Carolina state line. The Tennessee Department of Transportation is currently working to expand the highway to four lanes across the state. The easternmost portion of the highway in Tennessee is the Ocoee Scenic Byway, a winding, two-lane road through the Ocoee River gorge in Polk County. The steep terrain around the highway is subject to landslides, such as the massive slide in November 2009 that closed the highway for several months. =North Carolina= US 64 enters North Carolina in Cherokee County, west of Murphy. The highway serves the cities of Hendersonville, Brevard, Rutherfordton, Lenoir, Statesville, Lexington, Asheboro, Siler City, Cary, Raleigh, Rocky Mount, Tarboro, Williamston, and Manteo. The segment from Franklin to Highlands is a mountainous two-lane road limited to moderate-sized trucks. Large trucks are routed via Truck US 64 (US 23/441 and US 74) to Sylva, and Asheville. Interstate 40 travels through Statesville on a route originally designed in 1950 as a bypass of US 64, intersecting with Interstate 77 at what was once intended to be a bypass of US 21. Within the Raleigh city limits, US 64 follows the southern section of the Beltline. In 2006 a major section known as the Knightdale Bypass opened to ease traffic. After it was completed, US 64 became a divided freeway between Cary and Williamston, and carried at least four lanes between Asheboro and Columbia. US 64 serves as a gateway to the Outer Banks, ending at Nags Head where it meets U.S. Route 158 and NC 12. Overall, US 64 runs from the western edge of the state to the Outer Banks. It is the longest highway in North Carolina; a common way to express coverage of the entire state is to say, \\"from Murphy to Manteo\\". US 64 runs through both. History U.S. Route 485 (US 485) was commissioned in 1926, looping west of US 85 between Santa Fe and Raton, New Mexico. In 1931, it became an extension of US 64. In 1959, the Arizona Department of Transportation submitted a proposal to extend US 64 west from Santa Fe, New Mexico to US 89 near Tuba City, Arizona, which was rejected. The portion south of Taos was removed in 1974, when US 64 was realigned and extended to Farmington, and became NM 68\\\\. Major intersections ;Arizona : in Teec Nos Pos ;New Mexico : in Shiprock.

Although all five versions of the attraction are different in nature, all have a similar conical exterior façade that is a landmark for the respective park. The original Space Mountain coaster opened in 1975 at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. There are two tracks within this attraction, Alpha and Omega, which passengers can choose from. Other versions of the attraction were built at the other Disney parks (all except for the Shanghai Disneyland Park). History =Walt Disney World= Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom) The Space Mountain concept was a descendant of the first Disney \\"mountain\\" attraction, the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, which opened in 1959. The Matterhorn's success had convinced Walt Disney that thrilling rides did have a place in his park.Surrell, p. 37. WED partnered with Arrow Development Company, the same company that had helped design the Matterhorn's roller coaster systems years before.Surrell, pp. 38–40. The initial concept was to have four separate tracks, but the technology available at the time, combined with the amount of space required versus that which was available within Disneyland, made such a design impossible. Walt Disney's death in December 1966 and the new emphasis on preparing for the newly announced Disney World project forced WED to put aside the design of Space Mountain indefinitely.Surrell, p. 40. The Magic Kingdom's early success, and its unexpected popularity with teens and young adults, prompted WED to begin planning thrill rides for the new park shortly after its opening in October 1971.Surrell, p. 41. A new Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction was considered, but it wouldn't fit within Florida's Fantasyland. Ultimately, designers returned to designing Space Mountain. The Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland had the right amount of available land, and computing technology had improved significantly since the initial design phases.Surrell, pp. 41–44 However, it was decided the mountain would be built outside the park, on the opposite side of the train tracks that act as the perimeter of the park. To help cover the cost of developing and building Space Mountain, Card Walker, the CEO of Walt Disney Productions, convinced RCA chairman Robert Sarnoff to sponsor the new attraction; RCA was contracted by Disney to provide the communications hardware for the Walt Disney World Resort, and their contract stated that if Disney presented an attraction of interest, RCA would provide US$10 million to support it.Surrell, p. 43 Space Mountain then opened on January 15, 1975. =Disneyland= Space Mountain (Disneyland) The success of Walt Disney World's Space Mountain prompted designers to revisit their original plan to build one for Disneyland. After two years of construction, the $20 million complex opened on May 27, 1977, including the roller coaster, 1,100-seat Space Stage, 670-seat Space Place (fast food restaurant) and Starcade. Six of the original seven Mercury astronauts attended Space Mountain's opening: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Senator John Glenn, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. The lone exception was Gus Grissom, who had died in the Apollo 1 fire ten years earlier. Due in part to the opening of Space Mountain, the Memorial Day day attendance record was set, with 185,500 guests over the three-day period. Space Mountain at Disneyland was designed by Bill Watkins of Walt Disney Imagineering, including a tubular steel track design awarded . Due to space limitations, Disneyland's Space Mountain consists of only one track as opposed to the Magic Kingdom's two, and is of a completely different layout than either track of the latter park's. =Tokyo Disneyland= Space Mountain (Tokyo Disneyland) Space Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland opened with the park on April 15, 1983. It was the first version of Space Mountain to open concurrently with the park. From its opening in 1983 and until late 2006, Tokyo Disneyland's Space Mountain was an almost exact clone of Disneyland's Space Mountain. The ride was then redesigned to have a more sci-fi futuristic look to it similar to refurbished Walt Disney World version, with new effects, and a new spaceport which features a futuristic spaceship hanging from the ceiling. Like its Walt Disney World counterpart, there is no ride audio to the seats. =Disneyland Paris= The version at Disneyland Paris opened on June 1, 1995, three years after the opening of the park. It was originally called De la Terre à la Lune, and was originally designed as a view on space travel from a Jules Verne-era perspective, based on the novel From the Earth to the Moon. The track is significantly different from the other four, as it's the only one to include a launch and 3 inversions (Sidewinder, Corkscrew, Horseshoe). It underwent modifications in 2005 and became Space Mountain: Mission 2. This journey was slightly different to the first as it took riders beyond the Moon, to the very edge of the universe. In January 2015 the ride closed for yet another refurbishment and was reopened in August 2015. The ride temporarily closed in on January 8, 2017 and was replaced with Star Wars: Hyperspace Mountain on May 7. Mission 2 will return sometime in 2021. =Hong Kong Disneyland= Space Mountain prior to Star Wars \\"Hyperspace\\" retheming (Hong Kong Disneyland) Space Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland was based on the refurbished Space Mountain at Disneyland, with a similar soundtrack and the same layout. It also featured new show elements not presented in the refurbished California version (i.e. a \\"hyperspeed\\" tunnel). It did not feature the Rockin' Space Mountain configuration that was featured in Disneyland's Space Mountain in 2007. Unlike most Space Mountains, the boarding area for the attraction is quite small. Not present is a Space Station of its two most similar counterparts at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. Instead, a dark queue featuring neon earth-tone colored planets along with star patterns decorate the area. Lining the walls of the station are colored neon light bars that are used for lighting and decoration. Similar to the Disneyland Paris version of the ride, its Star Wars \\"Hyperspace Mountain\\" overlay theming, originally meant to be temporary, has become the permanent theme of the ride. The queue area has been fully refurbished with the addition of a full-sized replica X-Wing, a Character meeting area as well as a grey and white Star Wars queueline theme, although some elements of the original queue have also remained intact such as the planet models and star patterns. The ride's storyline is identical to the Disneyland Paris version. Ghost Galaxy Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy (Traditional Chinese: 驚心動魄太空山) is a seasonal Halloween overlay of Space Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland. It first premiered at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2007, and premiered at Disneyland on September 25, 2009, as part of the Halloween season at the parks. The latter makes use of effects previously used for the Rockin' Space Mountain overlay in 2007. Inside the Space Port, the planet screen at the front of the station has been changed to reflect the overlay, as well. While viewing the planet, a green \\"storm\\" appears over the planet, causing interruptions to the video feed. Static appears, then a blue screen, reminiscent of the Windows Blue Screen of Death, saying \\"LOSS OF SIGNAL...,\\" \\"SEARCHING...\\" and \\"SIGNAL ESTABLISHED\\". Outside on the dome, five projections play, with several Halloween-themed color schemes appearing between these projection shows: *The first projection shows the dome becoming a dull grey, with cracks and breaks forming on the dome. Suddenly, the dome seems to crumble and fall into nothingness. Then, a green grid appears at the top section of the dome, accompanied with a loud humming sound. *The second projection shows an alien arm resembling that of the nebula ghost running, pushing against the dome from the inside. *The third projection shows yellow scratch marks appearing on the dome. *The fourth projection shows lightning bolts shooting up the left side of the dome, then the right, the middle, and finally the entire dome itself. *The last projection shows the dome being turned into a bluish purple radar, with explosions that appear on the dome, resembling activity of the nebula ghosts. =Ride changes= With the refurbishments to Space Mountain, Ghost Galaxy has some significant changes. *The soundtrack echoes the attraction *The red lights at the top of the first lift hill are now an eerie green. *The flashing blue light tunnel between the first and second lift hills is now pitch black. *Instead of the spinning galaxy beyond the second lift, a giant ghost nebula electrifies the lift. *Projections of otherworldly wisps can be seen before the final lift, along with the ghostly nebula. *The ghosts pop up unexpectedly. Two places that are notorious for this are at a steep drop near the end as trains narrowly avoid being \\"clawed\\" by an unseen arm. The other spot is a ghostly head that pops out of the wall after the onride picture is taken when the train makes the final right turn to reenter the station.

Film Screenwriter Max Landis wrote a feature film based on the Space Mountain attraction, which was developed for a short time at Disney. The film was based in a 1950s retro-future. This idea of the future wouldn't contain the internet or cell phones but would be powered by many large contraptions and robots. One key plot point of the film involved the idea of people getting sent into hyperspace and, upon their return, realizing their souls had gone missing from them and they would eventually transform into terrifying monsters. The film was ultimately scrapped. On October 9, 2020, a new film adaptation of the ride was announced to be in development at Disney, with Joby Harold producing and writing the film alongside Tory Tunnell producing under their Safehouse Pictures banner. Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich of Rideback will also produce. Unlike the original idea, the film is described as a family adventure. The Space Mountain building is featured as an Easter Egg in the Disney films Meet the Robinsons and Tomorrowland. Graphic novel In November 2013, Disney Publishing Worldwide revived Disney Comics as an imprint in the US with the imprint's first publication was the Space Mountain graphic novel, its first original graphic novel, released on May 7, 2014.

The highway's western terminus is at US 62 in Reidland, Kentucky. Its present northern terminus is at Interstate 75 in Findlay, Ohio, though the route once extended as far north as Toledo. US 68 intersects with US 62 three times during its route. Route description US 68 is signed east–west in Kentucky, while in Ohio it is signed north–south. =Kentucky= US 68 in Mercer County, Kentucky U.S. Route 68 is designated as a \\"Scenic Highway\\" throughout Kentucky. US 68 goes near or through Reidland, Aurora, Cadiz, Hopkinsville, Elkton, Russellville, Auburn, Bowling Green, Glasgow, Edmonton, Greensburg, Campbellsville, Lebanon, Perryville, Harrodsburg, Lexington, Paris, and Maysville The majority of the route winds through forested, hilly terrain. US 68 is Broadway through downtown Lexington, and it is Harrodsburg Road before it leaves Lexington. The route passes several Civil War battle sites. The Jefferson Davis State Historic Site is along the highway about east of Hopkinsville at the small town of Fairview. The Battle of Tebbs Bend Historic Civil War Site is located near Campbellsville and the Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site is outside Perryville. There is an annual yard sale held along the highway for 4 days in early summer. The sections of the highway through Campbellsville and Lebanon are slated for expansion to begin in 2008. The long-term goal is to widen and make safer the entire US 68 corridor through Kentucky as part of the Heartland Parkway project. Sections in Kentucky have been improved in recent years. The Paris Pike which was completed in 2003. Work is currently in progress to make US 68 four lanes through Land Between the Lakes. This was accelerated, following a devastating collision of the cargo vessel MV Delta Mariner with Eggner Ferry Bridge in January 2012. =Ohio= US 33 interchange in Bellefontaine, Ohio US 68 takes a south–north route throughout Ohio, roughly paralleling Interstate 75 but covering counties one tier to the east of those counties covered by I-75. US 68 begins at the William H. Harsha Bridge over the Ohio River and duplexes with U.S. Route 52 for 5.6 miles while travelling on the north bank of the river. The highways separate at Ripley, at which point US 68 heads north as a generally rural two-lane highway, passing through or bypassing communities such as Georgetown, Mount Orab, Fayetteville, Wilmington, Xenia, and Yellow Springs. Shortly before reaching Interstate 70, it becomes a four-lane expressway, bypassing Springfield before transitioning back to a rural two-lane road as it approaches Urbana. As it continues north, US 68 passes through West Liberty, Bellefontaine, Kenton, Dunkirk, and Arlington on its way north to its terminus at an interchange with Interstate 75 outside Findlay. In total, US 68 traverses 179.1 miles within Ohio. History From 1926 until the late 1940s, in terms of the routing between Bowling Green and Perryville, US 68 went westward through Springfield, Kentucky to Bardstown, and followed U.S. Route 31E southward to near Horse Cave. US 68 then followed the current KY 218 (Charlie Moran Highway) westward into Horse Cave, and then joined U.S. Route 31W from there through Cave City to Bowling Green.\\"H.B.'s Fun Facts About Kentucky Highways\\". Archived from the original August 27, 2002. Retrieved July 12, 2016. US 68 moved to its current routing from Bowling Green to Perryville around 1948–49. US 68 previously ran to Toledo, Ohio, terminating at the west approach to the High Level Bridge south of downtown, but the Toledo-Findlay segment was decommissioned in the 1950s.U. S. G. S. Topographic Maps, Toledo 7.5 ' Quadrangles edited 1934 and 1951 and Dept. of Highways Map of Ohio, 1959. It also passed through Springfield, Ohio prior to its realignment onto a four-lane bypass of that city. Two spans of the US 68/KY 80 Eggner Ferry Bridge over Kentucky Lake collapsed after being struck by a cargo ship on January 26, 2012. The bridge reopened to traffic on May 25, 2012. That bridge was replaced by a new four- lane bridge a few years afterwards. Future In Clark County, Ohio, there is an almost full-access interchange between controlled-access US 68 and US 40/SR 4, which is itself a controlled-access highway until approximately 0.3-mile west of the US 68 interchange. One exit ramp from US 68 ends on Upper Valley Pike, rather than on US 40/SR 4; another entrance ramp includes two-way traffic and an at-grade entrance to a retirement community. On US 40/SR 4 between the controlled-access portion and US 68, there are an at-grade intersection at Upper Valley Pike, other street and driveway breaks in access control and a steep grade on the eastbound approach toward Upper Valley Pike. In September 2013, the Clark County-Springfield Transportation Coordinating Committee (TCC) ranked the US 40/SR 4/Upper Valley Pike intersection as the most hazardous in the county, based on 2010-2012 crash data. Because the road design over the years had played a significant factor in the high number of crashes in the area, the TCC conducted a study; in February 2006 it recommended reconfiguring the US 68 interchange and altering nearby traffic patterns. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) the same year approved $5 million to fund the project. However, the TCC soon rejected ODOT's money, concluding that even its recommended fix would not be enough to solve the area road network's underlying problems. Instead, the TCC is making small changes, such as improving traffic signal timing and adding signs. ODOT, for its part, is working on reducing the number of driveways near the US 40/SR 4/Upper Valley Pike intersection and on upgrading traffic signals. In Xenia Township, Greene County, Ohio, north of Xenia, ODOT plans to convert the intersection with SR 235, the state route's southern terminus, to a roundabout. As of summer 2020, construction is expected to begin in spring 2023 and to be completed that fall, with an estimated cost of $2 million.

Life and career  Born in Belœil, Quebec, he was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1891 election as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Rouville, Quebec. He represented the riding continuously until his retirement prior to the 1911 election. Brodeur was a firm supporter of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and came from a Rouges family. His father fought in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, and his maternal grandfather was killed in the Rebellion's Battle of Saint- Charles. As a young man, Brodeur studied law, graduating in 1884 with an LL.B. from the Université Laval in Montréal. He worked as a young lawyer with Honoré Mercier, before establishing his own law firm of Dandurand and Brodeuer with Raoul Dandurand. He also engaged in journalism for Liberal newspapers such as la Patrie and L'Électeur before becoming editor of Le Soir. He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons at the age of 29. After the Liberals won the 1896 election, Brodeur was appointed deputy speaker. He was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1899. He became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada following the 1900 election. Brodeur In 1904, he was appointed to the Laurier Cabinet as Minister of Inland Revenue where he introduced antitrust legislation to protect tobacco farmers from the monopolistic practices of the American Tobacco Company. In 1906, he was promoted to Minister of Marine and Fisheries and reorganized the Montreal Harbours Commission and instituted reforms in the department to reduce patronage and corruption. Brodeur was a member of the Canadian delegation to the 1907 Imperial Conference in London, and also helped negotiate a trade treaty with France. In 1910, he became Minister of the Naval Service and was responsible for introducing legislation to create the Canadian Navy. This signified a move towards Canadian independence from Britain. It was opposed by the Conservative Party, which preferred Canada's participation in the British Navy. By the end of his term, the new Navy consisted of 233 sailors and two cruisers, one on each coast. The policy of creating a Canadian Navy was also opposed by French-Canadian nationalists such as Henri Bourassa who feared that the Canadian Navy would only be used as a device to engage Canada in British wars. = Supreme Court of Canada = Prior to the 1911 election, Brodeur retired from politics and was appointed by Laurier to a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada. He retired from the court in 1923 to accept an appointment as the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. Brodeur died on the 2nd of January 1924, at the Lieutenant Governor's official residence of Spencer Wood in Sillery. Family Madame Emma Brodeur by William James Topley Louis-Philippe Brodeur married Emma Brillon, daughter of J. R. (Joseph-Régnier) Brillon, of Belœil, P.Q., in June 1887. Their son, Victor, attained the rank of Rear Admiral in the Royal Canadian Navy. The École Victor-Brodeur in Esquimalt, British Columbia, is named after him. Victor's son Nigel attained the rank of Vice Admiral.  Archives  There are Louis-Philippe Brodeur fonds at Library and Archives Canada and Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.

The highway's western terminus is in Memphis, Tennessee and its eastern terminus is in Chattanooga. It is the only U.S. Highway to begin and end in the same state, yet pass through other states in between. Prior to the U.S. Highway system signage being posted in 1926, the entire route was part of the Lee Highway. Route description Memphis The highway passes through Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. Most of the original eastern and western portions of the route through roughly follows the path of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, a railroad that predated the American Civil War and now operated by Norfolk Southern Railway as their Memphis-Chattanooga, Tennessee mainline. US 72 Alt. follows the Memphis and Charleston route through North Alabama. =West Tennessee= US 72 begins at Bellevue Boulevard (US 51) in Memphis. From Memphis, the route follows Union Avenue and Poplar Avenue into Collierville. Just south of Collierville, US 72 junctions State Route 385 (the Bill Morris Parkway), a freeway which links Collierville with I-240. The route enters Mississippi southeast of SR 385\\\\. This segment of the highway is concurrently designated State Route 86 (SR 86). =Mississippi= US 72 enters Mississippi in western Marshall County. The route follows rolling hills across the extreme northern part of the state, passing through Walnut and Corinth as it heads east. Near Burnsville, US 72 crosses the Divide Cut of the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway. Farther east, the route enters the Tennessee Valley and heads through Iuka before crossing into Alabama. All of US 72 in Mississippi has been upgraded to four-lane highway, with the last section between MS 302 and the Tennessee state line being completed in 2019. Legally, the Mississippi section of US 72 is defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3. =Alabama= Corridor V reassurance shield US 72 enters Alabama just west of Cherokee. The route parallels the Tennessee River east to Muscle Shoals, where US 72 Alternate splits from US 72. The mainline turns north, passing through Muscle Shoals and crossing the Tennessee River, entering Florence on the opposite bank. From Florence to Huntsville, the route heads through areas dominated by farmland. Between the two locales, however, US 72 enters Athens. After passing through Athens and an overpass with Interstate 65 (I-65), US 72 approaches Huntsville from the west. Part of this section has the local name University Drive. At an interchange with Memorial Parkway, the route turns northward briefly, joining the routes of US 231 and US 431, until it breaks off from the Parkway and heads eastward again. (This part is known to locals as \\"72 East\\" because it is east of the Parkway; it has no other name.) Northeast of downtown Huntsville, US 72 interchanges with I-565. I-565/US 72 Alt., part of Corridor V of the Appalachian Development Highway System, terminates at the interchange while US 72 takes over the freeway alignment, joining Corridor V. I-565 is mentioned as the eastbound route and SR 20 is mentioned as the westbound route. Signs for I-565 east at this interchange recently were changed to remove any mention of SR 20 east. Most of the US 72 portion of Corridor V is a four-lane divided expressway with at-grade intersections. Past Huntsville, US 72 follows several mountain valleys to Scottsboro. From Scottsboro, the route follows a northeasterly routing similar to that of the Tennessee River as it enters Tennessee for the second time. All of US 72 within Alabama is four lanes in width. Additionally, much of US 72 has been upgraded through northeast Alabama, with interchanges at the major state highways. Just west of Moores Mill Road in Huntsville, US 72 becomes limited access over Chapman Mountain. Throughout Alabama, US 72 is paired with unsigned State Route 2 (SR 2). The stretch of US 72 paralleling I-59 to the far northwest in between Scottsboro and South Pittsburg contains multiple freeway-style Interchanges. =East Tennessee= US 72 enters Tennessee for the second time just south of South Pittsburg. At South Pittsburg, Corridor V ends at an interchange with Interstate 24. US 64, concurrent with I-24 west of the exit, departs the expressway and forms an overlap with US 72 through Kimball to Jasper, where US 41 joins the concurrency. Just east of Jasper, the highways cross the Tennessee River on Nickajack Lake. The route then follows a cut in the Cumberland Plateau made by the Tennessee River to the western outskirts of Chattanooga, where it interchanges with I-24 once more. Just east of the interchange, US 11 joins the overlap. Together, US 11, US 41, US 64, and US 72 follow the bluffs on Lookout Mountain above the Tennessee River to Chattanooga, where the routes follow Broad Street north into downtown. At the corner of Main Street and Broad Street, US 72 comes to an end; US 76 begins at the intersection, making one highway in essence a continuation of the other. US 72 originally went through downtown South Pittsburg on Cedar Avenue. History =West Tennessee= Originally, US 72 followed US 45 to Selmer and followed a route west to Memphis. In 1931, US 64 replaced US 72 between Memphis and Selmer. In 1935, US 72 was routed to Memphis through Mississippi from Corinth removing the extension on US 45 to Selmer. As late as the early 1970s, US 72 followed State Route 57 (Poplar Avenue) from Collierville to its western terminus at East Parkway N. (which carried US 64, US 70, and US 79, as well as State Route 1). During the mid-1980s until the early 2000s, U.S. 72's westbound route in midtown Memphis was changed to switch from Poplar Avenue to a westbound off- ramp connection with Union Avenue (just as its name changed from Walnut Grove Road), instead of following Poplar west to East Parkway North. (In the same trend, eastbound US 72 ignored East Parkway South and continued eastward on Union—joining SR 57—until an exit ramp deposited the two highways onto eastbound Poplar.) Some signs still remain from this route change. =Mississippi= In Tishomingo County, US 72 originally followed the current Road 172 / Quitman Street through Iuka before being bypassed in the mid-1980s. Also, An Old US 72 exists south of US 72 between Burnsville and Glen. US 72 also followed Alcorn County Road 218 and entered Corinth on Proper Street. Until 1935, US 72 followed US 45, now Polk Street / Mississippi Highway 145 north into Tennessee. Also, included in the original 1935 routing west of Corinth followed Mississippi State Route 2 / Kossuth Road to Kossuth before turning west. Continuing westward, yet another segment of Old US 72 exists south of US 72 in Benton County from just west of the Tippah County line to just east of the Wolf River near Canaan. The bridge across the Wolf River collapsed due to flooding and is now closed; much of this segment is now on private property and little evidence of pavement remains due to washout and ecological succession. The continuation of this segment west of Wolf River to Mississippi Highway 5 is signed Wyatt Road. Finally, there is one more route that may have been a former US 72 road alignment. Boswell Road begins as a curve off of US 72 between Slayden and Mount Pleasant as a gravel road, and heads generally parallel to US 72 as a gravel road, before stopping in Mount Pleasant at Mississippi Highway 311. The possible former alignment then continues from the staggered junction heading west as a partially paved road. This road is now broken by Mississippi Highway 302, but continues to head west as a gravel road for a mile, for a total of approximately . =Alabama= 1926 Alabama highway sign Most of the original US 72 route in Alabama paralleled the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, a critical route for the South during the American Civil War. Some sections of the original road were named the Memphis Pike reflecting the idea of connecting Chattanooga to Memphis, Tennessee. The original route also belonged to the original route of the Lee Highway. Both of these designations can be found in western Colbert County where sections of the original highway, including parts of Colbert County Route 20 still bear those names. The original route once passed through Tuscumbia on what is named today the Old Lee Highway and Main Street. This route was bypassed in the 1960s. In Florence US 72 originally followed Huntsville Road to Royal Avenue, then north to Tennessee Street, and finally west to Court Street. Its route was later moved two blocks south through downtown Florence, from Tennessee Street to Dr. Hicks Boulevard. East of Florence the original route is now County Highway 66 through downtown Rogersville and Killen. Athens' Clinton and Washington Streets hosted a Business 72 route in earlier years. This route was decommissioned in the 1980s. US 72 has seen several route changes in Huntsville that included a temporary route down Sparkman Drive in the 1960s. Other original routes include Andrew Jackson Way to Holmes Avenue and down Holmes Avenue to reconnect to the original route. Prior to 1931, US 72 passed through Big Cove between Huntsville and Paint Rock via Little Cove Rd/Old \\"US 431\\". That route was abandoned for the one used today over Chapman Mountain. Other original routes include State Route 35 from Woodville to the west side of Scottsboro, State Route 279 east of Scottsboro, and State Route 277 from Stevenson to Bridgeport. State Route 277 carries the distinction of being the last two-lane section of US 72 in Alabama. Today, the entire route through Alabama has a minimum of four lanes. Major intersections Special routes =Muscle Shoals–Huntsville alternate route= U.S. Route 72 Alternate (US 72 Alternate) exists in Alabama on the south side of the Tennessee River between Muscle Shoals and Decatur. US 72 alt. crosses the Tennessee River at Decatur along with US 31 and follows the entire route of Interstate 565. However, signs on I-65 at the I-565 exit make no mention of US 72 Alt. and only mention AL 20 westbound from the I-65/I-565 junction. AL 20 was co-signed with US 72 Alt. from Muscle Shoals to Huntsville. AL 20 has since been truncated to the junction of I-65 just east of Decatur. Originally, US 72 Alt. turned off of AL 20 on to AL 53 (Jordan Lane) in Huntsville and followed it north to rejoin with US 72\\\\. With the completion of I-565 in the early 1990s, US 72 Alt. was routed along with I-565 to the termination of I-565 at US 72\\\\.

First airing on May 11, 2003 the show takes a look at Formula One Grand Prix events that were run 10 years prior to the present season. A one-hour show, the announcers, SPEED's Formula One commentary team, Bob Varsha, Steve Matchett, and David Hobbs, perform a mixture of a commentary as if the race is taking place right now along with reminiscing about rules changes and also Matchett's then role with Michael Schumacher's team. In 2003, when the show looked back at the 1993 season, dominated by Alain Prost, Varsha was the show's host, while Hobbs and Matchett looked at videotape of the races, and reminisced. That changed in 2004, when Matchett began introducing the race that would be seen on an episode and wrapping up each show, while Varsha joined Matchett and Hobbs to do commentary. Speed Channel picked up the rights to broadcast the years-old races in their three-year agreement with FOM in 2003. It was included in their contract that allowed them to continue broadcasting live Formula One races, though it cost extra money, as the Formula One archives are rarely opened to any network. On April 2, 2004 the show had the daunting task of airing the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, and showing the crash that claimed the life of 3-time World Drivers' Champion, and 41-time Grand Prix race winner Ayrton Senna in that event. Matchett, a mechanic for Benetton-Ford that weekend, made these remarks at the beginning of the broadcast: :\\"Welcome to F1 Decade, Speed Channel's retrospective of the 1994 Formula 1 World Championship. We have reached round three-the San Marino Grand Prix. The constant, metronomic beat of the clock has led us, inescapably, to Imola, and when the date 1994 and the name of Imola are brought together, they combine to form nothing but black, somber memories. The events of that race weekend, from the morning of April 28, when the teams first assembled at the track, until the evening of Sunday, May 1, rest amongst motor racing's darkest times. It was a weekend of tragedy, despair, and death. 10 years on, it may be that some viewers would prefer not to watch the coverage of these events, and if you feel in any way unsure, then I urge you to switch off your TV now. We cannot shy away from the fact that three very serious accidents happened.* The events of Imola are a part of the sport's history. The aftermath of that horrible weekend would forever change the way Grand Prix cars are built, and forever change the way the races themselves are conducted. We at Speed Channel feel it is only proper that the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix is correctly documented, and that, in our opinion, must include correct coverage of Ayrton Senna's fatal accident.\\" (*)-There had already been two serious accidents in the days before Senna's-one on April 29 during Friday practice, that nearly killed Rubens Barrichello, and one on April 30 during Saturday qualifying that killed Roland Ratzenberger. The show returned in 2005, taking a look back at the 1995 season, when Michael Schumacher took his second straight World Drivers' Championship. F1 Decade was not renewed for 2006; if it had been, it would have looked back at Damon Hill's championship season in 1996. Show trivia *The series' first episode took a look at the opening round of the 1993 Formula One season, the 1993 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, which was the last South African Grand Prix ever held. *Matchett worked on Johnny Herbert's car as a mechanic at Benetton. Herbert and Matchett both claimed their maiden Formula One wins in the 1995 British Grand Prix, a race perhaps made most famous for the fact that Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill crashed out of the race while battling for the lead. At episode's end, Matchett talked about how nervous he was during the closing laps of the race, and how much the win had meant to him. Said Matchett, \\"I freely confess that those closing laps at Silverstone rank amongst the most stressful times of my life! They seemed to take forever!\\" Herbert and Matchett would team up for another Formula One win in 1995 -- the 1995 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, another race in which Schumacher and Hill crashed out together. *A special edition of the show took place on September 26, 2003, during the weekend of the 2003 United States Grand Prix, when Jackie Stewart joined Hobbs to take a look back at the 1973 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, which Stewart won. * On May 1, 2004, a special re-broadcast of the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was aired to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the tragic deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna. The broadcast, as Steve Matchett said in the introduction to it, was not cut or edited to exclude Senna's fatal crash.

Route description =Kansas= US-73's former southern terminus at I-435 in Kansas City. U.S. Route 73 begins at I-70 in Kansas City in a concurrency with U.S. Route 24, U.S. Route 40, and K-7. Two miles north of its terminus, US 24 and US 40 turn west, while US 73 continues north with K-7. It continues north with K-7 through Lansing, where it intersects K-5. US 73 and K-7 then continue through Leavenworth. It goes northwesterly from Leavenworth, meeting K-192 near Easton and at Atchison, turns west. At Atchison, it loses K-7 and is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 59. It goes west and turns northwest near Lancaster at its intersection with K-9. It goes through Huron and begins a concurrency with K-20 near Everest. It goes west into Horton and intersects U.S. Route 159. The two highways continue north together and meet U.S. Route 36 at Hiawatha. After a brief northwesterly routing through Reserve, US-73 and US-159 turn north and enter Nebraska. =Nebraska= U.S. Route 73 enters Nebraska south of Falls City still concurrent with U.S. Route 159. They run north into Falls City and separate. Shortly after leaving Falls City, US 73 turns west, passes through Verdon, and ends at U.S. Route 75 just north of Dawson. History The original southern terminus was at Atoka, Oklahoma at an intersection with U.S. Highway 75. From the creation of the highway in 1926 until April 11, 1935, US 73 was split between Oswego, Kansas and Horton, Kansas. US 73E followed modern US 160 from Oswego to Columbus, then modern US 69 to Kansas City, where it then latched onto what is now US 73. The US 73E designated then went from Kansas City to Horton. US 73W followed the route of modern U.S. Route 59 from Oswego to K-39, K-39 west to Chanute, modern U.S. Route 169 from Chanute to Garnett, modern US 59 again from Garnett to Nortonville, and then modern U.S. Route 159 from Nortonville to Horton. On April 10, 1935, US 73 was truncated at Kansas City with the modern designations taking over the old routes and US 69 taking over the Atoka-Oswego segment. In Kansas City, US 73 previously followed U.S. Route 24 into downtown Kansas City, Kansas, terminating at the Intercity Viaduct (Lewis and Clark Viaduct), before Interstate 435 was completed. After I-435 was completed, US 73 ended at its intersection with I-435. On December 1, 2008, the southern terminus was rerouted, along with US 24 and US 40, southward along K-7 to its new terminus at I-70.AASHTO October 2008 meeting Nebraska also had a split highway, with the split between Tekamah and Winnebago between 1935 and 1957. US 73E went north through Decatur along the current route of U.S. Route 75, while US 73W went west from Tekamah along current Nebraska Highway 32 to Oakland, then north from Oakland in a concurrency with U.S. Route 77. The original northern terminus was south of Auburn, Nebraska, near Howe, Nebraska. US 73 went east through Howe, then south to Stella, Nebraska, then east through Shubert, Nebraska, then south to the current highway.Nebraska Highways 61 to 100 In 1932, the highway was extended to South Sioux City, Nebraska. In 1965, the route was shortened to Winnebago, Nebraska. In 1984, U.S. 75 was removed from western Iowa along Interstate 29 and placed on U.S. 73's route, superseding it through Omaha, Nebraska and truncating the highway to its present northern terminus near Dawson, Nebraska. K-227 was a highway in Kansas that was designated on September 9, 1968.. K-227's southern terminus was at K-4 and U.S. Route 59 (US-59) in the city of Atchison and the northern terminus was at K-9 and US-73 in Atchison. In 1980, US-73 was realigned along K-227 and at that time K-227 was decommissioned.

Rock makes his first appearance as a playable character in the fighting game Garou: Mark of the Wolves, the last chapter in the Fatal Fury series, as the new lead character from the series. Rock appears in the series as the son of Geese Howard, the main antagonist from the previous Fatal Fury games, who was killed by Terry Bogard. However, Terry started to take care of Rock to the point he teaches him to fight. Besides his appearance in Mark of the Wolves, Rock is featured in few games from The King of Fighters series as well as various crossovers from SNK. He was voiced by Eiji Takemoto () since debut until Maximum Impact Regulation A, later voiced by Yuuma Uchida (). In the English edition of KOF: Maximum Impact he is voiced by Jon Thomas, and by Mike Lane in its sequel. Rock has also been featured in manwhua adaptations from the games he has appeared as well as the anime The King of Fighters Another Day and The King of Fighters: Destiny. Rock's character has received various responses from video games publications. His debut in Mark of the Wolves has been highly praised by reviewers although some of them considered his character to be too strong in comparison to the others. However, his development in the KOF: Maximum Impact series has been criticized due to his English voice actor and his new outfit. Conception and design Early sketch of Rock by Nobuyuki Kuroki. The character of Rock Howard was created by Nobuyuki Kuroki in 1998. Both he and Yasuyuki Oda wondered what type of hero would succeed Terry Bogard in Fatal Furys latest game, Garou: Mark of the Wolves. While they were not confident with Rock, they still decided to make him as the new protagonist. Rock was designed to contrast previous masculine Fatal Fury characters by giving him a more bishonen appearance some thing Kuroki felt the sequel needed to balance the cast. In his development blog for KOF: Maximum Impact 2, Ureshino states that he does not know about Rock's mother or the true inheritor of Geese's legacy but hints that it would most likely conflict with Terry if SNK released another game involving game. For The King of Fighters XIV Rock was considered to be included but due to Geese's appearance at, they found it complicated as Mark of the Wolves took place years after Geese's death in the Fatal Fury series, until they changed their minds to include Rock as a DLC character. According to Oda, Rock was originally a weak character in his own debut. As a result, the staff highly worked in Rock's fighting style from The King of Fighters XIV to be more powerful and at the same time become more popular. At the same time, SNK wanted Rock to retain many of his original traits from Garou such as the way he moves his gloves among others. Rock has blond hair and red eyes. He appears in most games wearing a red, black and white leather jacket. Under the jacket, he has a black T-shirt with short sleeves. He additionally sports black gloves, black leather pants and black shoes. Several of the Miera brothers' prototype designs were assigned to other characters' alternate outfits; in this case, Alba's prototype design became Rock's alternate outfit. Such extra outfit shows him with a brown jacket similar to Terry's in Mark of the Wolves. He also sports jeans and gloves from different colors. His hair is additionally more spiky than how it normally is. Two of his extra outfits from KOF: Maximum Impact 2 are also cosplays from Kaede, the lead character from The Last Blade, and Kain R. Heinlein, the final boss from Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Attributes In spite of his father's ways, Rock is a warm, friendly and compassionate young man, possessing Terry's strong sense of justice and heroism. Every day, Rock fights off his evil side and tries to get out of the shadow of his father. He is the middle term between Geese's excessive evil and Terry's excessive festive personality. Rock is also a very compassionate man, offering to help those in need such as helping Hotaru Futaba to find her older brother. He also tends to be very uncomfortable and nervous around women, having been raised by men nearly all of his life. His move list is an amalgam of Terry and Geese. He possesses several of Geese's trademark moves such as the and the , in which he throws various energy waves to the ground. He also has the that sends energy to an entire area, the Shinkunage throw, reversals, and the . Moves loaned from Terry include the , a series of ascendent kicks, variants of various moves from Terry, including the , which is a DM version of Terry's Burn Knuckle. Also, his Crack Counter is a reversal that can be directed high or low akin to Geese, where upon succeeding, Rock slams an opponent with a kick that resembles Terry's Crack Shot. In comparison with his father, Rock still lacks the control over his \\"evil blood\\", which boils from time to time hurting him after ending a combat with the Raging Storm and the Deadly Rave. Thus, most of moves taken from his father take him more time for recovering or are less powerful. However, the precedent of his lineage states that Rock has not reached the top of his game yet. Appearances Rock makes his first appearance in Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory, in which it is revealed how he becomes friends with Terry Bogard. After Terry kills Geese, he adopts Rock, whom he takes care of like his son. Rock becomes a playable character in Garou: Mark of the Wolves, having lived with Terry for ten years. During this time, a new King of Fighters tournament arose under the name \\"Maximum Mayhem\\", which Rock and Terry both decide to compete in. By the end of the tournament, Rock finds his final opponent is Kain R. Heinlein, who reveals himself to be both the host and Rock's uncle. Kain, aware that Geese Howard's will held presumably valuable secrets but unable to discover them without assistance, wins Rock's aid in working through the document by offering information regarding Rock's mother—whom Kain claimed was still alive. Terry accepts Rock's decision to become Kain's new partner, with Rock promising to return. Despite making several cameos in games from The King of Fighters series, Rock was only playable in the spin-off games KOF: Maximum Impact and Maximum Impact 2 for the several years. Both games feature Rock entering into King of Fighters tournaments developed in Southtown prior to the events of Mark of the Wolves. Rock makes his first playable appearance in a mainline King of Fighters title in The King of Fighters XIV, being added to the game via post- launch downloadable content. Rock also appears as a playable character in the crossover video games NeoGeo Battle Coliseum and Capcom vs. SNK 2. Rock also appears in the 2006 original net animation The King of Fighters: Another Day. In the second episode Rock finds Lien Neville fighting Billy Kane, Geese's former right-hand man, in the Geese Tower. As Lien is about to be killed, Rock saves her, which enrages Billy as he cannot believe that he is Geese's son. As Billy attacks Rock, Lien shoots a laser that takes Billy out of the tower. Memories of Stray Wolves, a twenty-minute featurette serves as a retrospective of the Fatal Fury series, with Terry narrating the events of the games to Rock. The first seven volumes from the manhua The King of Fighters 2003 by Wing Yen features a short chapter from Garou: Mark of the Wolves based on Rock's training with Terry. In the last of the chapters, Rock fights Grant, who is revealed to be a childhood friend who always protected him. Despite feeling sad for fighting his friend, Rock defeats Grant in order to meet the host of the Maximum Mayhem tournament, his uncle, Kain. Rock is featured in The King of Fighters All Star and also featured as a cameo in the King of Fighters Stadium stage in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Reception Rock was voted as the number one favorite character with 190 votes at the time of his debut in Garou: Mark of the Wolves in a popularity poll from such game developed by SNK. Video games publications have commented on Rock's character, with most of them praising his debut and development in various game. Anthony Chau from IGN noted Rock to be one of the most notable characters from Mark of the Wolves. However, he commented that his moveset was very unbalanced in comparison to the ones from other characters, becoming one of the strongest characters from the game. Gamesarefun.com writer Andrew McClure labelled Rock's moves to be a cross between Terry Bogard and Geese Howard with the exception of Geese's \\"pretzel\\" strongest moves. He additionally liked Rock's development in various games, praising his appearance in Capcom vs. SNK 2. Greg Kasavin from GameSpot agreed on this, praising him to be one of the most notable additions from Capcom vs. SNK 2. Kurt Kalata from Armchairempire liked the creation of NeoGeo Battle Coliseum as it allowed players to use both Geese and Rock for the first time (which is actually inaccurate; the first game where both characters were playable was Capcom vs. SNK 2) due to how story is behind these two characters and how popular they are. Like Chau from IGN, Kasavin from GameSpot also complained on how much powerful and fast was Rock but in KOF: Maximum Impact, commenting that he has \\"no real weakness\\" even though if the player uses his moves several times. Jon Thomas, Rock's English voice actor for KOF: Maximum Impact has been criticized by Ryan Genno from Gamingtarget.com to be one of the worst from the game as gives Rock \\"as much emotion as a block of cheese.\\" The alternative costume for his character in KOF: Maximum Impact 2 has also been criticized by Luke Albiges from Eurogamer who noted it to just look \\"plain wrong\\", ruining Rock's \\"seminal badass\\" appearance. Den of Geek found Rock's debut in KOFs main series with The King of Fighters XIV interesting due to the fact in this timeline his father is alive unlike in the Fatal Fury one. Rock's revelation as a DLC was leaked by fans; this angered Oda who wanted to surprise fans with the official trailer. Nevertheless, Oda hoped the fans would enjoy playing as him. In November 2019, mangaka Itokatsu known for writing Silver Nina made her own sketch of Rock in tribute of the anniversary of Mark of the Wolves.

Owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, the station primarily airs an all-news radio format. It is the local affiliate for ABC News Radio and identifies itself as \\"KOMO News 1000 AM and 97.7 FM.\\" KOMO is a clear-channel Class A station, broadcasting with 50,000 watts, the maximum power for American AM stations. It is non- directional by day but uses a directional antenna at night to avoid interfering with WMVP Chicago and XEOY Mexico City, the two other Class A stations on 1000 AM. Under favorable conditions, KOMO can be heard in the daytime from Vancouver, British Columbia to Portland, Oregon. At night it can be heard across much of Western North America. The station's studios and offices are co-located with sister station KOMO-TV within KOMO Plaza (formerly Fisher Plaza) in the Lower Queen Anne section of Seattle, directly across the street from the Space Needle. The transmitter is on Vashon Island, off SW 159th Street. While KOMO primarily runs an all-news format, in the early morning on weekdays it carries two syndicated news programs from Westwood One: First Light and America in The Morning. Some midday hours feature longer-form interviews and call-ins. And on weekends, some hours include shows on money, health and wine, as well as some paid brokered programming. KOMO's programming is simulcast full-time on 97.7 MHz KOMO-FM, licensed to Oakville, Washington, as well as on several FM translator stations. History In July 1926, KOMO was founded on Harbor Island as KGFA 980 by two owners: Birt F. Fisher, whose lease on Seattle radio station KTCL was about to run out, and the Fisher brothers of Fisher Flouring Mills, who had been on the island since 1911. (The Fisher Brothers and Birt Fisher were not related.) In preparation for the switch to the new station, Birt Fisher changed KTCL's call sign to KOMO. In December, his lease ended, and he took the call letters with him to KGFA. KOMO 980's first broadcast was December 31, 1926. The studios moved to Downtown Seattle in 1927. The station also began a long-running affiliation with NBC Radio that year as well, primarily with the Red Network, but also with the short-lived West Coast NBC Orange Network from 1931 to 1933. Over the following years, KOMO's frequency would go from 980 to 1080, back to 980, down to 920, up to 970, then back to 920, and settled at 950 after the NARBA frequency shakeup in 1941. =1944 call letter swap between KJR and KOMO= Fisher's Blend Station bought NBC Blue Network affiliate KJR from NBC in 1941. However, the August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission's \\"duopoly\\" rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market,\\"Ban On Multiple Ownership in Same Area\\", Broadcasting, August 11, 1941, pages 6-7. and an attempt by the Fisher family to be granted an exemption was unsuccessful.\\"KOMO-KJR Seek Relief on Duopoly\\", Broadcasting, March 13, 1944, page 18. The Fishers decided to keep the superior frequency of 1000 kHz, but also keep the KOMO call letters that they had held since the 1920s. Thus, on May 6, 1944 KOMO and KJR swapped call letters, with the KOMO call sign moving from 950 kHz to the more desirable 1000 kHz.\\"KOMO, KJR in Seattle Exchange Call Letters\\", Broadcasting, April 24, 1944, page 72. 950 kHz was a \\"regional\\" frequency, with a power limit of 5,000 watts, while 1000 kHz was a \\"clear channel\\" frequency, which allowed powers up to 50,000 watts. The next year KJR was sold to Birt F. Fisher, who was unrelated to the KOMO owners.\\"KJR-KOMO Separation\\", Broadcasting, 12 November 1945, p. 100. At its new frequency, KOMO began broadcasting with 50,000 watts of power from its current transmitter site on Vashon Island in 1948. New studios at the corner of Fourth and Denny, near what is now the Seattle Center, were dedicated in February 1948 and included space for an expansion into television broadcasting. The cost of the new facility exceeded $1 million. KOMO Radio/TV's former broadcast facility photographed circa 1948-1959. Note the \\"NBC Affiliate\\" script on the facade. KOMO-TV's former broadcast facility at the current site of Fisher Plaza, taken on March 2, 1995, near the intersection of 4th Avenue North and Denny Way. This building was completed in 1948, expanded in 1975, and demolished in 2000 to make way for building 2 of the Fisher Plaza complex. In 1953, KOMO-TV first signed on the air on Channel 4 as an affiliate of the NBC television network. Channel 4 swapped affiliations with KING-TV in 1958 and joined the ABC television network. KOMO radio followed suit with by switching to the ABC radio network the next year. Through the 1940s and 50s, KOMO carried network dramas, comedies, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts, during the Golden Age of Radio. By 1964, old-line network programming had been phased out and KOMO carried a MOR music format. Long-time morning drive personality Larry Nelson began in 1967. By 1971, KOMO was more of an Adult Contemporary music format. From 1967 to 1978, KOMO was the original flagship station of the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association with Bob Blackburn on play-by-play. Norm Gregory, formerly of KJR and KZOK-FM, joined the staff as afternoon disk jockey in 1984. KOMO carried a full-service schedule of music, personality, news, talk and Washington Huskies sports well into the early '90s. Still the station played more music than most full service AM radio stations throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Until 1993, the station was playing music in all dayparts though news was aired locally every hour. In the fall of 1993, evening talk programming was added. Dayparts gradually changed from music to talk and by the spring of 1996, the conversion to news-talk was complete. In January 1981, former FM Rock Programmer Ken Kohl joined KOMO. When Kohl arrived, the station's ratings were in the middle of the pack. After building the station's news commitment and implementing KOMO's first major marketing effort, Kohl and his KOMO team inched to within a tenth of a point of market leader 710 KIRO. In January 1987, Kohl departed Seattle for KFI in Los Angeles. For the next several years, KOMO unsuccessfully attempted to directly compete with market leader KIRO. Following an outcry from loyal fans following his firing at KIRO-FM (\\"The Buzz 100.7\\") in 1999, local comedian Pat Cashman took over as KOMO's morning drive host, with Dr. Laura added for middays. In late 2002, Fisher Communications announced a six-year contract for Seattle Mariners play-by-play rumored to be worth at least $10 million annually, a record for any Major League Baseball radio broadcast agreement, which started in the 2003 season. After the agreement expired in 2008, Mariners broadcasts returned to KIRO. Concurrent with the acquisition of the Mariners broadcast rights, KOMO dropped its talk shows and became an all-news station with reports from an enlarged radio news staff and material from KOMO-TV newscasts. Some notable anchors include Bill Yeend, Manda Factor, Brian Calvert (who also works as a reporter and weather caster on KOMO-TV), Lisa Brooks, Bill Rice, Art Sanders, Nancy Barrick, Pamela McCall, and Eric Slocam. It was announced on May 11, 2009 that KOMO would be simulcast on KFMY, an FM station in Oakville, Washington, starting on May 15, 2009.KOMO Newsradio to be heard on FM and AM KFMY changed its call letters to KOMO-FM in August 2009 to reflect the simulcast. The move was made to improve KOMO's coverage in the southern part of the market, as well as giving listeners who prefer the sound of FM that option. On April 11, 2013, after 87 years of owning the station, Fisher Communications announced that it would sell its properties, including KOMO, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Although Sinclair primarily owns television stations, the company has retained KOMO and Fisher's two other Seattle radio stations, KVI and KPLZ-FM. The deal was completed on August 8, 2013. Two months after the sale, several radio employees were laid off as part of general cutbacks by Sinclair at most of the stations they acquired from Fisher. Marketing slogans Early 1970s: \\"From the Olympics to the Cascades, from Vancouver (B.C., Canada) to Vancouver (Washington), this is KOMO Radio 1000!\\" (also) \\"You're in KOMO Country\\". Slogan was used with a heavily orchestrated instrumental jingle package from a Canadian studio. The package was called \\"Big Timber\\", and was commissioned exclusively for KOMO. Early 1980s: \\"A taste of what you're living for, KOMO AM 1000, Seattle!\\" Early 1990s: \\"The station you depend on!\\" 2002–2005, 2006-2007: \\"First For Local News, Traffic and Weather.\\" Similar to KOMO-TV's past slogan of \\"First 4 Local News.\\" 2005–2006: \\"The commuter's best friend.\\" 2007–2009: \\"The Northwest's News, Traffic and Weather Station.\\" 2009–2014: \\"Everything you need to know.\\" 2011–2012: \\"Western Washington's News, Traffic and Weather Station.\\" 2012–2014: \\"What happens next, happens here.\\" 2014–2016: \\"Stay connected.

KIRO-TV and KING-TV apparently have no issue with accepting advertising for a radio station owned by the same company that owns Channel 4, but do take issue with the use of the \\"KOMO\\" call sign as an implicit promotion of KOMO-TV. The radio station instead promotes itself as \\"AM 1000\\" in ads on KIRO-TV and KING-TV.

He was first elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1900 election and represented the riding of Bonaventure Quebec in the Gaspé Peninsula without interruption until his death in 1937. Marcil was born to a French-Canadian father and Irish mother. His father's family settled in New France around 1665. Growing up in the Ottawa-Hull area, he served as a House of Commons page, then went on to work as a journalist for the Montreal Gazette and several other newspapers. Marcil ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party in the 1897 provincial election before winning a seat in the federal parliament in 1900. He worked hard to obtain projects for his community including the construction of bridges, lighthouses and the establishment of a ferry service. Marcil was nominated for the position of Speaker by Wilfrid Laurier following the 1908 election. Despite initial opposition by Ontario Tories, he was unanimously elected to the position. He was a popular Speaker and might have continued through a second Parliament had the Liberals not been defeated in the 1911 election. He returned to the backbenches, and concurrently was elected to sit on Montreal's city council as an alderman in 1918 while remaining an MP. From 1921 to 1931, he served as Chairman of the Liberal caucus in Ottawa. He was Dean of the House from 1930 to his death in 1937. Charles Marcil was not the only member of his family to be involved in politics. In the late 19th Century, his uncle Doctor David Marsil was mayor of Saint-Eustache, Quebec from 1871 to 1875 and appointed to the Legislative Council of Quebec in 1888. Charles Marcil's brother Georges was the last mayor of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, before the city was annexed to Montreal in 1910. Georges' granddaughter Susie Marcil was married to Daniel Johnson, Premier of Quebec in 1994. Another notable relative was Charles Marcil's maternal uncle, Edward P. Doherty, an American Civil War officer who formed and led the detachment of soldiers that captured and killed John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of United States President Abraham Lincoln.

He had a 3-year tenure as the rhythm guitarist of Guns N' Roses, replacing Izzy Stradlin in 1991 during the Use Your Illusion Tour. Following this, Clarke went on to forge a solo career as well playing guitar with Slash's Snakepit, Kat Men, Heart, Nancy Sinatra, Kathy Valentine (of the Go-Go's), MC5 and forming his own group Rock Star Supernova with members of Metallica and Mötley Crüe. Clarke's production work includes albums by L.A. Guns, Bullets and Octane, The Bronx and Vains of Jenna. Biography = 1985–1991: Early music career = Gilby Clarke started his musical career during the first half of the Eighties, replacing Candy's original guitarist, Geoff Siegel, who later played with the Nymphs. Gilby eventually replaced the band's lead vocalist and penned several unreleased fan favorites including, \\"Dance America\\". He left them to form Kill for Thrills, a metal band which released the EP Commercial Suicide and the LP Dynamite from Nightmareland and before eventually disbanding. Kill for Thrills was a supergroup of sorts with Jason Nesmith (son of former Monkees Mike Nesmith) on Guitar, and Todd Muscat formerly of seminal L.A. Punk band Decry, on Bass and then later with Junkyard after Kill for Thrills. Muscat is also the brother of Brent Muscat (Faster Pussycat, L.A. Guns, Sin City Sinners). All members have deep roots in the Los Angeles rock scene. = 1991–1994: Guns N' Roses = Following rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin's decision to abruptly quit the band,Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 344 during Use Your Illusion Tour in 1991, citing a combination of Axl Rose's personal behavior (he would consistently delay the start of shows by hours at a time) and his mismanagement of the band and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions,Bozza, Anthony, and Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 337 Clarke was chosen as his replacement, playing out the rest of gigs of the tour which lasted until 1993. His first show with the band was December 5, 1991 in Worcester, MA, USA. During many shows throughout the tour, Rose introduced Clarke and had him play \\"Wild Horses\\", a Rolling Stones cover with Slash. On November 23, 1993, Guns N' Roses released a collection of punk and glam rock covers entitled \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" where many of the tracks were recorded with original Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin during the Use Your Illusion I and II sessions and then were later re-recorded by Clarke. Gilby Clarke's contract was not renewed and he was gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a \\"hired hand\\". Clarke was not involved in the recording of 'Sympathy for the Devil', stating \\"I knew that that was the ending [of Clarke's involvement in Guns N' Roses] because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me\\". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him \\"Hey, enjoy your last show\\". Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns N' Roses Pinball. Clarke's only other appearances on a Guns N' Roses release would be on the live and compilation albums Live Era '87–'93 and Greatest Hits. Clarke is featured on Guns N' Roses video releases Use Your Illusion I, Use Your Illusion II and Welcome to the Videos. =1994–2006: Slash's Snakepit and solo career= Following the end of the Use Your Illusion Tour in 1993, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash began recording demos of material that he had written during the tour, at his home studio with bandmate Matt Sorum. Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez soon started to come around to jam with them. They eventually recorded twelve demo songs. Eric Dover, live guitarist for Jellyfish, successfully auditioned to become the group's singer. Slash and Dover wrote the lyrics for all the tracks, except \\"Monkey Chow\\" which was contributed by Clarke and \\"Jizz da Pit\\" which is an instrumental written by both Slash and Inez. The album was released by Geffen Records in February 1995 charting at No. 70 on the Billboard 200. For the tour in support of the album, James LoMenzo and Brian Tichy, both members of Zakk Wylde's solo band, joined the band to replace Inez and Sorum who could not tour with the group due to other commitments. With Guns N' Roses regrouping to record a new album, Snakepit disbanded with Clarke resuming his solo career, releasing his second album The Hangover in 1997. In 1994, he released his debut solo album Pawnshop Guitars on Virgin Records which featured contributions from several of his close friends. Ryan Roxie (Alice Cooper) on guitar, Will Effertz on Bass and Marc Danzeisen (Riverdogs, Little Caesar) Drums and backing vocals, also including all the then members of Guns N' Roses. It went gold in Argentina. Since then he has released another three solo albums, The Hangover, Rubber and 2002's Swag as well as the live album 99 Live. He formed the band Col. Parker with ex-Stray Cat Slim Jim Phantom and former touring additional GN'R keyboardist Teddy \\"Zig Zag\\" Andreadis, releasing the album Rock N Roll Music in 2001. In addition, he made a guest appearance on the L.A. Guns album Shrinking Violet, which he also produced. Clarke also produced The Bronx's self-titled album released in 2003 and Girlsplayboys debut album From Ritual to Romance in 2006, and L.A. Guns' 2001 album Man in the Moon. In 2002 Clarke worked with Nancy Sinatra on her album California Girl and a year later joined Heart on their national tour. = 2006–2012: Rockstar Supernova and reunion with GNR on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame = Clarke (right) with Steven Adler in July 2012 In 2006, Mötley Crüe drummer, Tommy Lee, formed Supernova with Clarke on guitars and former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted. The band used the TV show Rockstar to find a new lead singer. Lukas Rossi was chosen as their lead singer. However, there was already a band from California called Supernova. On June 26, 2006, the California band filed a federal lawsuit and on September 12, 2006, U.S. District Judge John A. Houston in San Diego ruled in favor of the original Supernova, granting their request for a preliminary injunction. The injunction stopped the band from Rock Star: Supernova from \\"performing rock and roll music, or recording, or selling rock and roll music recordings under the same name, pending a trial of this action on its merits, or until otherwise ordered by the court.\\" The band renamed itself Rock Star Supernova. Clarke produced a cover of Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\" on Rockstar: Supernova runner-up Dilana Robichaux's 2007 album, also released as a single on digital download websites. In 2007 he released a best of album featuring tracks from all of his solo albums as well as two songs from the Col. Parker project and a rerecording of the song \\"Black\\", featuring vocals by Rock Star: Supernova runner-up Dilana. In July 2008 Gilby Clarke played at the G-TARanaki Guitar Festival in New Zealand. His solo band included bassist Muddy Stardust and drummer Dennis Morehouse. He then toured North America as part of the Rock n' Roll Fantasy Camp. Clarke reunited with Guns N' Roses members Slash, Steven Adler, Matt Sorum and Duff McKagan, during the live performance, at the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on April 14, 2012. Clarke himself was not inducted as part of the band.

The disease was first linked to malaria by the Sierra Leonean physician Dr John Farrell Easmon in his 1884 pamphlet entitled The Nature and Treatment of Blackwater Fever. Easmon coined the name \\"blackwater fever\\" and was the first to successfully treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet. Signs and symptoms Within a few days of onset there are chills, with rigor, high fever, jaundice, vomiting, rapidly progressive anemia, and dark red or black urine. Causes The cause of hemolytic crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of red blood cells resulting in hemoglobinemia (hemoglobin in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, anuria (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death in the majority of cases. The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an autoimmune reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with Plasmodium falciparum. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to Plasmodium vivax. Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but cerebral malaria has a higher mortality rate. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950. It may be that quinine plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria prophylaxis. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria. Treatment The treatment is antimalarial chemotherapy, intravenous fluid and sometimes supportive care such as intensive care and dialysis. Prominent victims *Prior to his photography career, Henri Cartier-Bresson contracted blackwater fever while hunting in Western Africa. Expecting to die, he sent instructions to his family on his wishes for a funeral. He made a full recovery. *Zoologist John Samuel Budgett died from the disease in 1904, after returning from a collecting trip to West Africa, in search of specimens of the fish Polypterus.\\"John Samuel Budgett(1872–1904): In Pursuit of Polypterus\\" BioScience May 2001 / Vol. 51 No. 5 *Missionary and explorer George Grenfell died after a bad attack of blackwater fever at Basoko on 1 July 1906. *Jesse Brand, a missionary to the Chat Mountains in India, died of blackwater fever in 1928. *Actor Don Adams, best known as Maxwell Smart from the popular sitcom Get Smart and as the title character in Inspector Gadget, contracted blackwater fever after being shot in combat at Guadalcanal during World War II. Adams was evacuated from his United States Marine Corps unit to a hospital in New Zealand where he ultimately made a full recovery. *Humanitarian and MMA fighter Justin Wren contracted malaria, which devolved into blackwater fever, while drilling water-wells for Congo Pygmies in 2013. The affliction nearly claimed Wren's life. He was misdiagnosed four times and required airlift to Uganda, where he narrowly recovered from severe symptoms. *Aeneas, Jeannie Gunn's husband, is described as having died from Blackwater Fever or Malarial Dysentry at Elsey Station in the Northern Territory in 1903.

History  The 89th Division was officially activated in August 1917 under the command of Major General Leonard Wood. The division was inactivated in May 1919. The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve (present-day United States Army Reserve) on 24 June 1921 and assigned to the states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota. The headquarters was organized on 2 September 1921. Soldiers from the Division cross the Rhine River in assault boats, 1945. The 89th Infantry Division landed in France at Le Havre, 21 January 1945, and engaged in several weeks of precombat training before moving up to the Sauer River into jump-off positions east of Echternach, 11 March 1945. The next day, the offensive began, and the 89th plunged across the Sauer in a rapid advance to and across the Moselle, 17 March. The offensive rolled on, and the division assaulted across the Rhine River on 26 March 1945 under intense fire in the Wellmich-Oberwesel region. A pontoon bridge was built across the Rhine from St. Goar to St. Goarshausen. In April, the 89th attacked toward Eisenach, taking that town on 6 April. The next objective, Friedrichroda, was secured by 8 April. On 4 April 1945, the 89th overran Ohrdruf, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp. The division continued to move eastward toward the Mulde River, capturing Zwickau by 17 April. The advance was halted, 23 April, and from then until VE-day, the division saw only limited action, engaging in patrolling and general security. Three towns, Lößnitz, Aue, and Stollberg, were kept under constant pressure, but no attacks were launched. The crossing of the Rhine between 22 and 28 March 1945 The 89th was reactivated as a Reserve unit in 1947 with headquarters in Wichita, Kansas and redesignated as the 89th Division (Training) in 1959. In 1973 the division colors were cased and the shoulder patch (but not the lineage and honors) was continued in use as the 89th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM). (ARCOMs were not tactical commands, but were instead regional conglomerations of unrelated units. Upon mobilization, units within the ARCOMs would be assigned to active duty units with which they were aligned.) The 89th ARCOM was later redesignated as the 89th Regional Support Command, and in 2003 it became the 89th Regional Readiness Command. In its 2005 BRAC recommendations, United States Department of Defense recommended realigning the Wichita US Army Reserve Center by disestablishing the 89th Regional Readiness Command. This recommendation was part of a larger recommendation to re-engineer and streamline the command and control structure of the Army Reserves that would create the Northwest Regional Readiness Command at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. The 89th currently exists as the 89th Sustainment Brigade in the Reserve.

During World War I and World War II, it was known as the 84th Infantry Division. From 1946 to 1952, the division was a part of the United States Army Reserve as the 84th Airborne Division. In 1959, the division was reorganized and redesignated once more to the 84th Division. The division was headquartered in Milwaukee in command of over 4,100 soldiers divided into eight brigades—including an ROTC brigade—spread throughout seven states. Changes to the U.S. Army Reserve organizations from 2005 until 2007 redesigned the unit as the 84th Training Command (Leader Readiness) and it was paired with the Army Reserve Readiness Training Center (ARRTC). The flag resided at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. As a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) throughout the Army, the ARRTC was moved to Fort Knox, Kentucky. The 84th Training Command (LR) underwent a command-directed move to Fort Knox, Kentucky in advance of the ARRTC in September 2008. Since the move, the 84th Training Command and ARRTC split, leaving the ARRTC with leader readiness and training support. The 84th Training Command was re-designated once again to 84th Training Command (Unit Readiness). In September 2010, the 84th was renamed 84th Training Command and began reorganization. The 84th mission currently supports three numbered and three named training divisions – The 78th Training Division (Ft. Dix, NJ), the 86th Training Division (Ft. McCoy, WI), and the 91st Training Division (Ft. Hunter Liggett, CA), Atlantic Training Division (Ft. Dix, NJ), Great Lakes Training Division (Ft. Sheridan, IL), Pacific Training Division (Camp Parks, Dublin, CA) Tradition has it that the division traces its lineage to the Illinois militia company in which a young Captain Abraham Lincoln served during the Black Hawk War of 1832. The division patch was selected to honor this legacy and the division's origin in Illinois. For this reason, the alternative nickname of \\"Lincoln County\\" Division\\" has been used to denote the 84th. World War I The 84th Division trained at Camp Zachary Taylor during World War I. Troops from Indiana and Kentucky made up this division. For World War I, personnel were first enlisted from the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Kentucky and were formed into an infantry division in 1917, whereupon they chose the formation's distinctive patch and nickname. Organized at Camp Taylor, Kentucky, in Sept., 1917. The division was composed of National Army drafts from Indiana and Kentucky, and remained in training at Camp Taylor until Aug., 1918. It was deployed to France in October 1918 to serve as a training formation for replacements which would be sent to the Western Front. At the war's end, the formation was recalled home and, without having seen combat actions, inactivated in January 1919. Its commanders included Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (25 August 1917), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (6 October 1917), Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (26 November 1917), Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (15 December 1917), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (1 March 1918), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (5 June 1918), Maj. Gen. Harry C. Hale (21 July 1918), Brig. Gen. Wilber E. Wilder (18 October 1918), Maj. Gen. Harry C.

The headquarters was organized on 6 September 1921. World War II The 84th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 October 1942, at Camp Howze, Texas, about 60 miles north of Dallas. Then, it was composed of the 333rd, 334th and 335th Inf. Regts.; 325th, 326th, 327th and 909th FA Bns.; 309th Engr. Combat Bn.; 309th Med, Bn.; 84th Sig. Co.; 784th Ord. Light Maintenance Co.; 84th QM Co.; 84th Recon Troop. It embarked on 20 September 1944 and arrived in the United Kingdom on 1 October, for additional training. The division landed on Omaha Beach, 1–4 November 1944, and moved to the vicinity of Gulpen, the Netherlands, 5–12 November. The division entered combat on 18 November with an attack on Geilenkirchen, Germany, (Operation Clipper) as part of the larger offensive in the Roer Valley, north of Aachen. Operating under the command of Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks the division was supported by British tanks of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, specialist armoured units of 79th Armoured Division, and XXX Corps' artillery.Horrocks, pp. 233–6.Doherty, pp. 140–1.Christopherson, pp. 465–72. Taking Geilenkirchen on 19 November, the division pushed forward to take Beeck (Geilenkirchen) and Lindern (Geilenkirchen) in the face of heavy enemy resistance, 29 November.The Geilenkirchen Salient After a short rest, the division returned to the fight, taking Wurm and Würm (Geilenkirchen), Mullendorf, 18 December, before moving to Belgium to help stem the German winter offensive (Battle of the Bulge). Battling in snow, sleet, and rain, the division threw off German attacks, recaptured Verdenne, 24–28 December, took Beffe and Devantave (Rendeux), 4–6 January 1945, and seized La Roche, 11 January. By 16 January, the Bulge had been reduced. After a 5-day respite, the 84th resumed the offensive, taking Gouvy and Beho. On 7 February, the division assumed responsibility for the Roer River zone, between Linnich and Himmerich (near Heinsberg), and trained for the river crossing. On 23 February 1945, the second day of Operation Grenade, the division cut across the Roer, took Boisheim and Dülken, 1 March, crossed the Niers on 2 March, took Krefeld, 3 March, and reached the Rhine by 5 March. One day before, the 'Krefeld-Uerdinger Brücke' was blown off by Wehrmacht soldiers.Ninth Army to the Rhine, p. 173ff. The division trained along the west bank of the river in March. After crossing the Rhine, 1 April, the division drove from Lembeck toward Bielefeld in conjunction with the 5th Armored Division, crossing the Weser River to capture Hanover, 10 April. By 13 April, it had reached the Elbe, and halted its advance, patrolling along the river. Soviet troops were contacted at Balow, 2 May 1945. The division remained on occupation duty in Germany after VE-day, returning to the United States on 19 January 1946 for demobilization. It was redesignated a reserve formation on 21 January 1946. Troops of the 84th Infantry Division liberated two satellite camps of the Neuengamme Concentration Camp: Ahlem (a.k.a. Hannover-Ahlem), on 10 April 1945, and Salzwedel, on 14 April 1945.

Cold War to present Following the conclusion of World War II, the division was made part of the Army Reserve. In January 1946, it was redesignated the 84th Airborne Division and headquartered out of Wisconsin. In 1947, it was designated as the Army's Airborne Reserve Command. Five years later, in 1952, the division was reorganized again, this time as a training division composed of three regiments—the 274th, 334th, and 339th. Throughout the 1950s, the division would continue its conversion to a training formation, changing its subordinate unit makeup from regiments to brigades and support groups. On 24 January 1991, elements of the 84th Division (Training) were activated and mobilized for support roles in Operation Desert Storm. Less than three months later, on 22 March 1991, the elements were returned home. In 1993, reorganization within the Army Reserve brought about the a merger between the 84th and the 85th Division (Training). The move expanded the 84th Division's area of command to include the rest of Wisconsin and Illinois, as well as all of Missouri and Iowa. Soon after, in June 1994, units from the 84th participated in peacekeeping operations as part of the multinational in the Sinai, Egypt, and remained there until July 1995. In April 1995, the formation was once more redesignated, this time as an institutional training division. This change brought with it command of units and training in the state of Nebraska. In August 1995, army reorganization further expanded the 84th's range of authority to command the fourteen U.S. Army Reserve Forces Schools in Region E—Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. In October 2004, the 84th Division (Institutional Training) underwent a major transformation. All eight brigades realigned under the 100th Division and the Headquarters and Division Band combined with the Army Reserve Readiness Training Center (ARRTC) located at Fort McCoy, Wis., to create the 84th U.S. Army Reserve Readiness Training Command (84th USARRTC). The expertise and resources from the two units gave the 84th USARRTC an edge on the type and amount of training opportunities offered. The three Army Reserve NCO academies were also realigned under the new 84th USARRTC. In October 2006, the 84th USARRTC underwent another major transformation as 12 brigades from the Army Reserve's Institutional Training Divisions realigned under the command. The brigades were responsible for Officer Education System (OES) training, such as the Combined Arms Exercise (CAX) and Intermediate Level Education (ILE), and Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (SROTC) support to universities across the country. In February 2007, the 84th USARRTC was renamed the 84th Training Command (Leader Readiness) in response to the unit's transformation under the Army Reserve's Decision Point 74. The 84th Training Command had exercise command and control over three professional development brigades, one schools brigade, one training development brigade, the 84th Division Band, and eventually the Small Arms Readiness Group. In September 2008, the 84th Training Command relocated from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin to Fort Knox, Kentucky. In October 2009, the focus of the 84th Training Command shifted from leader readiness to unit readiness. The Army Reserve Readiness Training Center and the three U.S. Army Reserve NCO Academies moved from the umbrella of the 84th and became the 83rd USARRTC which reported directly to the U.S. Army Reserve Command. In October 2010, the 84th Training Command reorganized to align with the transformation of the Army Reserve. The 84th Training Command is the executing agent of the U.S. Army Reserve's Combat Support Training Programs which includes Warrior Exercises (WAREX), Combat Support Training Exercises (CSTX). The 84th Training Command provides multiple collective training opportunities which prepare units for operational deployments worldwide. =Subordinate units= The 84th Training Command as of August 2016: *Headquarters, 84th Training Command (Fort Knox, Kentucky) * 78th Training Division (Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey) ** 1st Brigade OPS (Fort Gillem, Georgia) *** 3rd Battalion/318th Regiment (Fort Meade, Maryland) *** 2nd Battalion/323rd Regiment (Lumberton, North Carolina) *** 2nd Battalion/311th Regiment (Fort Bragg, North Carolina) *** 3rd Battalion/309th Regiment (Liverpool, New York) * 86th Training Division (Fort McCoy, Wisconsin) ** 1st Brigade OPS (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) *** 1st Battalion/329th Regiment (Indianapolis, Indiana) *** 3rd Battalion/397th Regiment (Whitehall, Ohio) *** 2nd Battalion/383rd Regiment (Fort Leavenworth, Kansas) *** 3rd Battalion/346th Regiment (Hattiesburg, Mississippi) * 91st Training Division (Fort Hunter Liggett, California) ** 1st Brigade OPS (Scottsdale, Arizona) *** 11th Battalion/104th Regiment (Boise, Idaho) *** 2nd Battalion/378th Regiment (Salt Lake City, Utah) *** 3rd Battalion/290th Regiment (Mustang, Oklahoma) *** 3rd Battalion/381st Regiment (Grand Prairie, Texas) * Atlantic Training Division (Fort Dix, NJ) * Great Lakes Training Division (Fort Sheridan, IL) * Pacific Training Division (Camp Parks, Dublin, CA) References =Notes= =Sources= * Stanley Christopherson (James Holland, ed.), An Englishman at War: The Wartime Diaries of Stanley Christopherson, DSO, MC, TD, London: Bantam, 2014, . * Richard Doherty, Hobart's 79th Armoured Division at War: Invention, Innovation and Inspiration, Barnsley: Pen & Sword, 2011, . * Lt-Gen Sir Brian Horrocks, A Full Life, London: Collins, 1960. *here The Army Almanac: A Book of Facts Concerning the Army of the United States - U.S. Government Printing Office, 1950 *US Army Reserve *Holocaust Encyclopedia External links *GlobalSecurity: 84th Division *Railsplitters: The Story of the 84th Infantry Division *Fact Sheet of the 84th Infantry Division from http://www.battleofthebulge.org *Tried By Fire Part 1 Tried By Fire Part 2 Movie of 84th Division during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 * is the website of the 84th Railsplitters Association LTC, formerly the 84th Division Alumni Association. 084th Infantry Division, U.S. Category:Military units and formations established in 1917 Infantry Division, U.S. 084 ","title":"84th Division (United States)"},{"id":"889473","text":"Kushtaka or Kooshdakhaa ( lit. \\"land otter man\\") are mythical shape-shifting creatures found in the folklore of the Tlingit and Tsimshian peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. They are similar to the Nat'ina of the Dena'ina Native Americans of South Central Alaska, and the Urayuli of the Yup'ik in Western Alaska. Physically, Kushtaka are shape-shifters capable of assuming human form, the form of an otter and potentially other forms. In some accounts, a Kushtaka is able to assume the form of any species of otter; in others, only one. Accounts of their behaviour seem to conflict with one another. In some stories, Kushtaka are cruel creatures who take delight in tricking poor Tlingit sailors to their deaths. In others, they are friendly and helpful, frequently saving the lost from death by freezing. In many stories, the Kushtaka save the lost individual by distracting them with curiously otter-like illusions of their family and friends as they transform their subject into a fellow Kushtaka, thus allowing him to survive in the cold. Naturally, this is counted a mixed blessing. However, Kushtaka legends are not always pleasant. In some legends it is said the Kushtaka will imitate the cries of a baby or the screams of a woman to lure victims to the river. Once there, the Kushtaka either kills the person and tears them to shreds or will turn them into another Kushtaka. Legends have it Kushtaka can be warded off through copper, urine, dogs, and in some stories, fire. Since the Kushtaka mainly preys on small children, it has been thought by some that it was used by Tlingit mothers to keep their children from wandering close to the ocean by themselves. It is also said that the Kushtaka emit a high pitched, three part whistle in the pattern of low-high-low.  Kushtaka in modern literature  Kusktaka appear in Pamela Rae Huteson's Legends in Wood: Stories of the Totems in the legend 'War with the Land Otter Men', as well as Pamela Rae Huteson's Transformation Masks with the 'Kooshdakhaa Den'; and Garth Stein's Raven Stole the Moon. Harry D. Colp describes a miner's encounter with the Kushktaka at Thomas Bay in the short story \\"The Strangest Story Ever Told.\\" It is also the subject of the Alaskan-set horror novel Kushtaka by David Pierdomenico. Kutshakas also appear in William Giraldi's novel Hold the Dark (2015). The second book of Ann McCaffrey's science-fiction The Twins of Petaybee series, Maelstrom, features a species of shape-changing deep-sea otter that refer to themselves as Kushtaka. The Kushtaka is the main antagonist in the Bill Schweigert novel The Beast of Barcroft (2015). Also they are depicted in the book Shamans and Kushtakas: North Coast Tales of the Supernatural by Mary Giraudo Beck https://books.google.com/books/about/Shamans_and_Kushtakas.html?id=4MHCCQAAQBAJ&source;=kp_book_description References Category:Alaska folklore Category:Tlingit culture Category:Legendary creatures of the indigenous peoples of North America Category:Legendary mammals ","title":"Kushtaka"},{"id":"889483","text":"The 8th Infantry Division, (\\"Pathfinder\\") was an infantry division of the United States Army during the 20th century. The division served in World War I, World War II, and Operation Desert Storm. Initially activated in January 1918, the unit did not see combat during World War I and returned to the United States. Activated again on 1 July 1940 as part of the build-up of military forces prior to the United States' entry into World War II, the division saw extensive action in the European Theatre of Operations. Following World War II, the division was moved to West Germany, where it remained stationed at the Rose Barracks in Bad Kreuznach until it was inactivated on 17 January 1992.http://www.fatherswar.com/8thinfdiv/70s90s/inactivation_orders.jpg Inactivation Orders History =World War I= *Activated: January 1918 *Overseas: November 1918 *Commanders: **Col.

Helmick succeeded Graves in command of the division. The overseas movement of the division to Europe began 30 October 1918. The 8th Field Artillery Brigade, 8th Infantry Regiment, 16th Infantry Brigade headquarters, and the 319th Engineer Regiment were the only divisional units to go to France. The 13th and 62nd Infantry Regiments were at sea when recalled after the Armistice, and the 12th Infantry did not leave its pre- embarkation point at Camp Mills, New York, because it was quarantined for Spanish influenza. The troops who did reach France became the garrison of Brest and assisted in building huge camps for troops about to embark for return to the United States. The 8th Infantry Regiment became part of the American occupation forces in Germany until August 1919 and the remainder returned to the United States in January 1919, after which the division disbanded. =Between wars= The 8th Division officially demobilized at Camp Lee, Virginia, in September 1919. The division was partially reconstituted on 24 March 1923, allotted to the Third Corps Area for mobilization purposes, and assigned to the III Corps. Camp George G. Meade, Maryland, was its designated mobilization station for reactivation. The 16th Infantry Brigade (12th and 34th Infantry Regiments), the 1st Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, the 15th Ordnance Company, and the 8th Tank Company (Light) were assigned to the division in October 1933 as Regular Army active units and formed the force from which the remainder of the division would be reactivated in the event of war. The commanding general of the brigade was considered the division commander for planning purposes. The 16th Infantry Brigade was stationed at Fort Howard, Maryland, from 1922 to 1928; Fort Hunt, Virginia, from 1928 to 1931; in Washington, D.C., from 1931 to 1936; and at Fort Meade from 1936 to the activation of the division. The division headquarters was organized in April 1926 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a Regular Army Inactive unit using personnel of the Organized Reserve. The active units of the division conducted annual training with the III and XIII Corps and the 79th, 80th, and 99th Divisions. Summer training camps were usually conducted at Camp Meade., pp. 216–217 The 16th Infantry Brigade's 12th and 34th Infantry Regiments, reinforced by the 3d Cavalry and the District of Columbia National Guard's 260th Coast Artillery, were called out on 28 July 1932 to quell potential trouble from the Bonus Army in Washington, D.C. The 12th Infantry was ordered to clear the United States Capitol and the camps on the Anacostia Flats of the veterans that afternoon. The division was also provisionally organized in 1939 for the First Army Maneuvers at Manassas, Virginia, with the 16th Brigade reinforced by the 66th Infantry (Light Tanks). In preparation for becoming a \\"triangular\\" division, the 8th Infantry Division was reactivated on 1 July 1940 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, without its Reserve units and assigned to the I Corps . =World War II= *Activated: 1 July 1940 at Camp Jackson, South Carolina *'Trained at Camp Laguna in California in 1943 *Overseas: 5 December 1943 *Campaigns: **Normandy **Northern France **Rhineland **Central Europe *Days of combat: 266. *Distinguished Unit Citations: 5 *Awards: Medal of Honor – 3 ; Distinguished Service Cross (United States) – 33 ; Distinguished Service Medal (United States) – 2 ; Silver Star – 768; LM – 12 ; DFC – 2 ; SM – 24; BSM – 2,874; PH – 1 ; AM – 107. *Commanders: **Maj.

McMahon was relieved shortly after the division arrived in Normandy. His replacement, Major General Donald A. Stroh was temporarily relieved during the Hurtgen fighting; the death of his son Harry, a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces who was shot down over Brittany, had made a deep psychological impact. After a rest, Stroh went on to command the 106th Infantry Division. Combat chronicle During World War II, the 8th Infantry Division was sent to Europe to fight against the Axis. After training in Ireland the 8th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy, 4 July 1944, and entered combat on 7 July. Shortly after its arrival, the division captured the French cities of Rennes and Brest. Fighting through the hedgerows, it crossed the Ay River, 26 July, pushed through Rennes, 8 August, and attacked Brest, France in September. When U.S. Brigadier General Charles Canham, who was at the time the deputy commander of the 8th Infantry Division, arrived to accept the surrender of German troops in Brest, the commander of the Brest garrison, General Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke asked the lower-ranking man to show his credentials. Canham pointed to his nearby troops and said \\"These are my credentials\\". That phrase has since become the 8th Infantry Division's motto. Following these actions, the 8th turned eastward toward the German border, taking part in the heavy fighting in the Hürtgen Forest in November 1944. The Crozon Peninsula was cleared on 19 September, and the division drove across France to Luxembourg, moved to the Hürtgen Forest, 20 November, cleared Hürtgen on the 28th and Brandenberg, 3 December, and pushed on to the Roer. That river was crossed on 23 February 1945, Duren taken on the 25th and the Erft Canal crossed on the 28th. The 8th reached the Rhine near Rodenkirchen, 7 March, and maintained positions along the river near Koeln. In early March 1945, the 8th had advanced into the Rhineland. It fought its way into the Ruhr region the following month. On 6 April the division attacked northwest to aid in the destruction of enemy forces in the Ruhr Pocket, and by the 17th had completed its mission. After security duty, the division, under operational control of the British Second Army, drove across the Elbe, 1 May, and penetrated to Schwerin when the war in Europe ended. On 2 May 1945, as it advanced into northern Germany, the 8th Infantry Division encountered the Neuengamme concentration camp Wöbbelin subcamp, near the city of Ludwigslust. The SS had established Wöbbelin in early February 1945 to house concentration camp prisoners who had been evacuated from other Nazi camps to prevent their liberation by the Allies. Wöbbelin held some 5,000 inmates, many of whom suffered from starvation and disease. The sanitary conditions at the camp when the 8th Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division arrived were deplorable. There was little food or water, and some prisoners had resorted to cannibalism. In the first week after liberation, more than 200 inmates died. In the aftermath, the United States Army ordered the townspeople in Ludwigslust to visit the camp and bury the dead. The 8th Infantry Division was recognized as a liberating unit by the U.S. Army's Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1988.

Medals of Honor Three soldiers of the 8th Division were awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II. *Private First Class Ernest Prussman, 13th Infantry Regiment. Prussman took over his squad on 8 September 1944 during the advance on Les Coates [wrong transliteration of Loscoat, near Brest] in Brittany, and disarmed several Germans, including a machine gun crew. Shot by a German rifleman, his dying act was to unleash a hand grenade that killed the man who shot him. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously. *Private First Class Walter C. Wetzel, 13th Infantry Regiment. As acting squad leader in the regimental Anti-Tank Company, PFC Wetzel defended his platoon's command post from an enemy attack on 3 April 1945. Wetzel threw himself on either 1 or 2 enemy grenades (sources vary) thrown into the C.P. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously. *Staff Sergeant John W. Minick, Company I, 121st Infantry Regiment. After his battalion was halted by enemy minefields during an advance on 21 November 1944 during the Hurtgen fighting, he led four men through the obstacle, then successfully destroyed an enemy machine gun post that had opened fire on the small party. Moving forward again, he single-handedly engaged an entire company of enemy soldiers, killing 20 men and capturing 20 more. Resuming the advance, he tried to scout through another minefield, but detonated a mine in the attempt. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously. =After World War II= The 8th Infantry Division was reactivated in 1950 as a training division at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and in 1954 became a regular infantry division.Wilson, John B. (1997). Maneuver and Firepower: The Evolution of Divisions and Separate Brigades, Washington, DC: Center of Military History, 245. In 1956-57 it was sent to West Germany, initially on a temporary basis in Operation Gyroscope, but remained in West Germany for decades.Wilson, 253; The Division's First Brigade (with subordinate units) was stationed in Mainz, the Second Brigade (with subordinate units) was stationed in Baumholder, and the Third Brigade (with subordinate units) was stationed in Mannheim (Sullivan and Coleman Barracks). In 1974, an amendment by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia led to two more brigades being organized for European service.Wilson, 366-367. The 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (\\"Brigade-76\\") was dispatched to Europe in the fall of 1976. It was stationed in Wiesbaden, attached to the 8th Infantry Division, and for eight years, made it unique - the 8th ID became the Army's only four-brigade division. In 1984, the 4th Brigade was inactivated and the division's size fell to the standard three brigades.Wilson, 389-390. From December 1957, until it was inactivated in January 1992, the 8th Infantry Division was headquartered at Bad Kreuznach. From the late 1950s until the early 1960s, the 8th Infantry Division was organized as a partially Airborne Pentomic division, with two of its five battle groups (the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry, and 1st Airborne Battle Group, 505th Infantry) on jump status. In 1963 the division was reorganized into a brigade structure with the 1st Brigade on jump status, and 1-504th was reorganized and reflagged as the 1st Battalion (Abn), 509th Infantry and 1-505th as the 2d Battalion (Abn), 509th Infantry. Supporting units throughout the division (for example, one field artillery battalion, one company of the engineer battalion, one platoon of the MP company, etc.) were also on jump status. The 8th Infantry Division operated its own jump school at Wiesbaden Air Base to support its 1st Brigade as well as other elements of the United States Army, Europe. In 1973 elements of the 1st Brigade were transferred to Vicenza, Italy, to establish a separate Airborne battalion combat team (1-509th INF) and the two Airborne infantry battalions were reorganized and reflagged as the 2d Battalion, 28th Infantry and the 2d Battalion, 87th Infantry. The reorganized 1st Brigade included a tank unit, the 4th Battalion, 69th Armor. =Desert Storm= Four battalions deployed to Operation Desert Storm.http://www.fatherswar.com/8thinfdiv/70s90s/desert%20storm.html 8th Infantry Division * Attached to 3d Armored Division: ** 4th Battalion, 34th Armor ** 12th Engineer Battalion ** 5th Battalion, 3d Air Defense Artillery * Attached to the 42d Field Artillery Brigade: ** 2d Battalion, 29th Field Artillery (155mm SP) =Inactivation= The 8th Infantry Division inactivated on 17 January 1992, with some elements being \\"reflagged\\" as part the 1st Armored Division, which had been stationed in southeastern West Germany.USArmyGermany.com = Commanders = * Maj.

At 1.3 million acres (5,300 km²), it is one of the largest designated wilderness areas in the United States (14th overall, but third-largest outside Alaska). It spans the Bitterroot Mountain Range, on the border between Idaho and Montana, and covers parts of Bitterroot National Forest, Clearwater National Forest, Lolo National Forest, and the Nez Perce National Forest. The Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area is immediately to its south, separated only by a dirt road (the Magruder Corridor). Together with adjoining public land, the two wilderness areas form a five million acre (20,000 km²) wild region. It is here that the Lochsa and Selway rivers form and flow westward to their confluence at Lowell (outside the wilderness along U.S. Route 12) to form the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River. The land ranges in elevation from on the Lochsa River to at Trapper Peak in the Bitterroot Mountains. One of the largest elk herds in the United States calls the wilderness home, and it also boasts a healthy population of bighorn sheep. This wilderness is one of the areas being used to reintroduce wild packs of the grey wolf. The high-elevation areas around the Bitterroot peaks are rugged alpine parkland. Lower areas are covered by dense coniferous forest.

The unit was first organized in August 1917 and activated the following September during World War I as the 80th Division. During World War II, the Division was redesignated on 1 August 1942, as the 80th Infantry Division. Nicknamed the \\"Blue Ridge Division\\", it was initially composed of draftees from the mid-atlantic states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. The Division was redesignated the 80th Airborne Division from December 1946 to May 1952. In May 1952 and March 1959, the unit was redesignated as a reserve infantry division and then a reserve training division. In 1994, the unit was granted the designation, 80th Division (Institutional Training). On 1 October 2008, the unit underwent a major transformation and is now the 80th Training Command.

Sturgis (22 November 1918). *Inactivated: May 1919. =History= Because of significant common heritage in the past (Indian War, Revolutionary War and Civil War), residents of Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia became the structure of the 80th Division. The 80th Division was organized in August 1917 at Camp Lee, Virginia. The units were made up mostly of men from the above three states. =Order of battle= * Headquarters, 80th Division * 159th Infantry Brigade ** 317th Infantry Regiment ** 318th Infantry Regiment ** 313th Machine Gun Battalion * 160th Infantry Brigade ** 319th Infantry Regiment ** 320th Infantry Regiment ** 315th Machine Gun Battalion * 155th Field Artillery Brigade ** 313th Field Artillery Regiment (75 mm) ** 314th Field Artillery Regiment (75 mm) ** 315th Field Artillery Regiment (155 mm) ** 305th Trench Mortar Battery * 314th Machine Gun Battalion * 305th Engineer Regiment * 305th Field Signal Battalion * Headquarters Troop, 80th Division * 305th Train Headquarters and Military Police ** 305th Ammunition Train ** 305th Supply Train ** 305th Engineer Train ** 305th Sanitary Train *** 317th, 318th, 319th, and 320th Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals The 317th Infantry included men from central and western Virginia; the 318th Infantry was made up mostly of men from the Shenandoah Valley and Tidewater areas; the 313th Machine Gun Battalion mostly had men from the Erie, Pennsylvania, area. These units comprised the 159th Infantry Brigade. The 318th Infantry were nicknamed the \\"squirrels\\" while training with the British in the Artois/Picardy section of France; the 1st Battalion was the \\"red squirrels,\\" the 2nd Battalion was the \\"gray squirrels,\\" and the 3rd Battalion was the \\"flying squirrels.\\" The 319th Infantry included men from the Allegheny County and Erie areas, and a few from eastern Ohio. The 320th Infantry had men from Pittsburgh; the 315th Machine Gun Battalion had men from Pittsburgh and Erie. These units combined to create the 160th Infantry Brigade. Each infantry regiment in the 80th Division used a unique helmet marking; the 317th used a diamond, the 318th a square, the 319th a circle, and the 320th Infantry Regiment a bowl shape. The headquarters of each regiment divided their shape using three vertical stripes of red, white, and blue; the 1st battalion of each regiment used solid red, the 2nd battalion white, and the 3rd battalion blue. Each company painted their respective letter inside the shape. The machine gun company of each regiment divided their shape vertically in half in red and blue; the supply company divided their shape in red and white. The 313th, 314th and 315th Field Artillery Regiments were composed of men almost exclusively from the state of West Virginia, and formed the 155th Field Artillery Brigade. Serving with the division were the 314th Machine Gun Battalion (men from the Tidewater area) as well as the 305th Engineer Regiment (men from the area east and north of Pittsburgh); the 305th Trains (Ammunition, Engineer, Supply and Sanitary) were men from western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia. The engineers were more often than not sent out ahead. During the rest period from 14 October through the Armistice, they finally were outfitted with U.S. Springfield and Browning automatic rifles. They had two weeks to train before the third and final push began in the Meuse-Argonne. It was also during this period that an attack formation was reorganized to allow for more maneuverability. =Meuse- Argonne= The 155th Field Artillery Regiment was in combat from the start of the Meuse Argonne, continuously with the 80th Division, but served also with the 90th Division into Germany, until after the Armistice. Altogether, the 155th served with five different divisions. During the Meuse Argonne campaign, the 80th Division was the only one that saw action during each phase of the offensive (three times). And they first earned their motto, \\"The 80th Division Moves only Forward!\\". The artillery of the division boasted more days of continuous combat firing than the batteries of any other American division. The 80th captured two Germans and one machine gun for every man wounded and one piece of artillery with gun crew for every 10 men wounded. Men of the 80th Division received 619 awards and decorations. =Helmet insignias= \\"Previously announced, the distinctive symbols of the various units of the Division were declared official on 30 April 1918. For the four Infantry Regiments, in their order beginning with the 317th Infantry, they were a diamond, square, circle, and semi circle. The symbol of each unit's Headquarters Company was colored red, white and blue; that of the Supply Company red and white; that of the Machine Gun Company red and blue. The battalion symbols were colored in red (Coys, A, B, C, D), white (Coys, E, F, G, H), blue (Coys, I, K, L, M) in numerical order. The three Machine Gun battalions were identified with a shield - blue and white (313th), red and white (314th), red and blue (315th), in order, beginning with the 313th M.G.Bn. Other Units of the Command were assigned equally distinctive symbols, thereby enabling property and individuals immediately identified by the markings required on the packing cases, wagons, helmets and other property articles\\". All artillery units wear the \\"Gun Sight\\" on their helmets. It referenced the 313th F.A. and 314th F.A. with two blocks at approximately 45 degrees and 270 degrees. The 315th F.A. was 155mm and their \\"Gun Sight\\" emblem was a variation of this emblem. It contained the infantry colors (blue) in the four quadrants. In the center, there was a star and the battery letter was in the center of the star. The engineer units were identified by spades on their helmets. White and red for the headquarters company, red for the 1st Battalion (Companies A,B,C), white for the 2nd Battalion (Companies D, E, F). Interwar period The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921 and assigned to the states of Virginia and Maryland, and the District of Columbia. The headquarters was organized on 1 September 1921. World War II General George Patton visits the US 80th Division on 3 November 1944 *Ordered into active military service: 15 July 1942; Initially, soldiers reported to Camp Forrest, Tennessee, named for General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a famous Confederate Cavalry commander in the Civil War. The Division later moved for training at Camp Phillips, near Salina, Kansas and at Camp Iron Mountain and Camp Laguna at the Desert Training Center in the California - Arizona Maneuver Area (DTC / C-AMA). The 80th Division, as part of MG Alexander M. Patch Jr.'s IV Corps, were stationed at Camp Laguna, AZ about 25 miles North of Yuma AZ. The 80th remained at the DTC / C-AMA from December 1943 to March 1944.Army Ground Forces Study #15, Mehler, 1946 *Overseas: 1 July 1944 *Campaigns: Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe *Days of combat: 239 *Distinguished Unit Citations: 6 *Awards: Medal of Honor-4; Distinguished Service Cross (United States)-34; Distinguished Service Medal (United States)-1; Silver Star-771; LM-12; DFC-5; SM-35; BSM-3,869, AM-123. *Commanders: Maj.

The division was destined to become the \\"work horse\\" of General Patton's Third Army and to play a key role in the breakthrough at Avranches. The Division then attacked Argentan, taking it, 20 August, and creating the Falaise Pocket. After mopping up in the area, the 80th took part in the Third Army dash across France, cutting through Saint-Mihiel, Châlons, and Commercy in pursuit of the retreating Germans until stopped by the lack of gasoline and other supplies at the river Seille. From 25 September to 7 November, the division maintained an aggressive defense of positions west of the Seille, and prepared for the Third Army sweep into the industrially vital Saar Basin. The attack jumped off on 8 November, the 80th advancing through Delme Ridge, Faulquemont, and St. Avold to within of Saarbrücken, when it was relieved by the 6th Armored Division, 7 December 1944. 80th crossing the Rhine near Mainz Battle of the Bulge After 10 days rest, the division returned to combat, moving southeast to take part in an attack on the Siegfried Line at Zweibrücken when the Germans launched their winter offensive in the Ardennes. The 80th was moved northward to Luxembourg and was hurled against the German salient, fighting at Luxembourg and Bastogne. By Christmas Day, men of the 80th were side by side with the tanks of the 4th Armored Division, battering forward through murderous opposition to help the 101st Airborne Division, besieged in Bastogne. Over frozen, snow- covered terrain, the attack gained nine bitter miles despite constant machine gun and mortar fire. The next day, the gap between the rescuers and the besieged was narrowed to 4000 yards. On 28 December, the 80th broke through, bringing relief to the 101st before driving the enemy across the Sure to Dahl and Goesdorf, 7 January 1945, and across the Clerf and Wiltz Rivers by 23 January. On 7 February 1945, the division stormed across the Our and Sauer Rivers at Wallendorf (Eifel), broke through the Siegfried Line, pursued the fleeing enemy to Kaiserslautern, 20 March, and crossed the Rhine, 27–28 March, near Mainz. Pursuit continued in April, the division defeating the German defenders at Kassel, driving rapidly to Erfurt on the 12th, and Weimar, Jena, and Gera on the 14th. Relieved, 21 April, it moved to Nürnberg for occupation duty and on 28 April, to Regensburg, then to the Enns River, battling to the very end. It has been alleged that the last shot fired on the western front was in Czechoslovakia by the 80th, the last of General Patton's divisions still in action. General Patton issued his cease-fire order at 0800 on 8 May 1945. By V-E day, the 80th Division had amassed 289 days of combat and had captured more than 200,000 enemy soldiers.

Cold War The division was inactivated in January 1946, but reactivated in December of that year as the 80th Airborne Division. Since then, the division has been reorganized several times. As an airborne division, it became one of 24 organized Reserve Corps divisions. In 1952, during the Korean War, it was reorganized again as the 80th Infantry Division and remained as such for seven years. In March 1959, it was reorganized as the 80th Division (Training), with a primary focus of providing initial entry training to trainees at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Jackson, South Carolina, a mission and structure that lasted for many years. In 1988 and 1990, the division carried out ten-week exercises for wartime mobilization missions named, \\"Old Dominion Forward\\" at Fort Bragg, setting up training for nearly 700 new Soldiers. Persian Gulf War Units from the 80th Division were activated in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Two 80th Division units were called to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The 424th Transportation Company of Galax, Virginia, was activated 17 November 1990. After training and equipping at Fort Eustis, Virginia, it deployed to Saudi Arabia 5 January 1991. For its service in the war the company was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Citation reading: \\"... under adverse conditions in a combat zone, logging over 850,000 accident- free road miles, in the countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.\\" By the end of the war, elements of the 424th had advanced as far as the Euphrates River in support of coalition assault units. The 424th returned to the United States on 29–30 June 1991, and to home station 3 July. Soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 318th Regiment, 4th Brigade, at Fort Story, Virginia, were activated 23 January 1991, and reported to Fort Eustis to train recalled reservists. Because of the short duration of the ground war in Iraq and Kuwait, additional Individual Ready Reserve troops were not called up and the 3rd Battalion was released from active duty and returned to home station 17 March. New training reorganization In 1992, the division began a training base expansion mission at Fort Benning, Georgia. The mission changed to professional roundout training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the following year when Reservists worked with active duty Army drill sergeants in training new soldiers. October 1994 marked the fourth major reorganization since World War II, when it became Headquarters, 80th Division (Training). Maintaining the Initial Entry mission, it expanded to provide \\"The Army School System\\" or TASS mission. The 80th took command and control of 10 Army Reserve Forces schools, and along with legacy divisions from World War II (84th, 95th, 98th, 100th, 104th, and the 108th) became one of seven institutional training (IT) divisions, located in seven regions throughout the U.S. The 80th Division (IT) provided instructions for units in Region B which included Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Delaware. Seven brigades of the 80th Division (IT) carried out specific training missions in the above states and proceeded to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, to support expansion of the U.S. Army Training Center and to conduct Basic Combat Training (BCT), One Station Unit Training (OSUT) and other specialized training, as directed by Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). Global War on Terrorism *Operation Noble Eagle After 11 September 2001, specialized training commenced with drill sergeant and instructor units mobilized to training posts in the U.S. *Operation Enduring Freedom in 2004, 80th Division (IT) units provided training and reconstruction support to the Afghanistan government. *Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005 in support, the 80th Division (IT) mobilized and deployed to Iraq in support of the largest activation of the division's soldiers since World War II, serving in every specialty and skill as a part of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq. Two soldiers were killed in action and two others died stateside while mobilized during this conflict. During the period 17 May 2005 to 15 August 2006, 80th Division (Institutional Training) displayed outstanding meritorious service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit planned and executed the largest mobilization and combat-zone deployment of the Army Reserve Division since 1945. Additionally, the unit was responsible for training and advising over 106,000 Iraqi Army Soldiers to include: two Iraqi Army Division Headquarters, seven Iraqi Brigade Headquarters, and twenty-two Battalions of Iraqi Soldiers. So far 80th Division soldiers have earned more than 1,144 medals and citations including 31 Purple Hearts, 2 Bronze Stars with Combat V, 467 Bronze Stars, 84 Combat Infantryman Badges (CIB) and 187 Combat Action Badges (CAB). The unit continues to support the Global War on Terrorism with individual and group deployments to the theater of operations as required. 80th Training Command On 1 October 2008, the 80th Division (IT) transformed to become the 80th Training Command (TASS). It expanded from the five states to reach across the entire country. Of the seven IT divisions, only three remain, with the 80th taking command of the entire TASS mission for the Army Reserve. The 80th expanded from eight brigades and 12 battalions to three divisions (94th, 100th, 102nd), 13 brigades, 63 battalions, and 14 training centers. The 80th is the third-largest command organization in the U.S. Army Reserve. Made up of over 7,300 Army Reserve Soldiers assigned to 15 brigade units aligned under three major subordinate one-star commands with units located nationwide—from Pennsylvania to Puerto Rico and from the Carolinas and Georgia to California. It has an operational control training relationship with a unit in Hawaii and a support relationship with a unit in Germany. The command's annual economic impact is about $40–60 million. In addition to the salaries of full-time civilian and military personnel, this figure also includes pay to Army Reserve soldiers, money spent locally for the purchase of supplies, services, maintenance support, equipment, facility construction and renovation, and the G.I. Bill college tuition payments to Army Reserve soldiers attending school. The 80th trains Army soldiers in the career military fields for Combat Support and Combat Service Support. The 94th Training Division (Force Sustainment) headquarters is located at Fort Lee, Virginia, and became fully mission capable in October 2009. The 100th Training Division (Operational Support) has its headquarters in Louisville. Kentucky, and will soon relocate to Fort Knox. The 102nd Training Division (Maneuver Support) headquarters is located at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and also became fully mission capable in October 2009.

He was the only person to serve as both Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada and Speaker of a provincial legislature. He represented Lévis in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal-Conservative member from 1867 to 1873 and from 1879 to 1883; he represented Bellechasse from 1875 to 1878. He also represented Lévis in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1867 to 1875. He was born in Saint-Pierre- de-la-Rivière-du-Sud, Lower Canada in 1825. He studied at the Petit Séminaire de Québec and Collège de Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière. He then studied medicine with his uncle Jean Blanchet and qualified as a doctor in 1850. A popular physician, Blanchet entered politics with his election as Mayor of Notre-Dame- de-la-Victoire, now part of Lévis Quebec (then Canada East) in 1845 at the age of 25. With the Province of Canada on military alert due to the American Civil War, Blanchet joined the militia and raised a battalion to defend the frontier against raids from the United States. During the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1870, he was in command of the militia on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. Blanchet was a Conservative and first ran for election to the Legislative Assembly in 1857 but was defeated. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Lévis in 1861 and 1863. He supported Canadian Confederation as a means of defending British North America against possible attack by the United States. He was concurrently elected in the 1867 federal election to the new House of Commons of Canada and to the Quebec Legislative Assembly. Under the law of the day, he was allowed to be a member of both legislatures at the same time. He became Speaker of the provincial legislature and served in that position for two terms. In the federal House of Commons, he was named by Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald to a committee investigating the Pacific Scandal. The federal election law was changed in 1874 to prohibit Members of Parliament (MPs) from concurrently sitting in a provincial legislature. Blanchet chose to resign his seat in the federal House of Commons. After losing his seat in the Quebec legislature to the much younger Étienne-Théodore Pâquet in the 1875 Quebec provincial election, he won a federal by-election in 1875 and returned to Ottawa as MP for Bellechasse. In the 1878 federal election, he ran in his old riding of Lévis. The election returned the Conservatives to power, and Macdonald nominated Blanchet to be Speaker of the House of Commons. Due to the tradition of alternating between English and French Speakers after each election, he returned to the backbenches following the 1882 election despite a successful term as Speaker. In 1883, he resigned from Parliament in order to accept a position as Collector of Customs for the Port of Quebec and served in that position until his death at Lévis in 1890 at the age of 70. He was buried in the crypt of Notre-Dame Church of Lévis.

The unit is currently active as the 102nd Training Division (Maneuver Support). Interwar period The division was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Seventh Corps Area, and assigned to the XVII Corps, with Arkansas and Missouri as its home area. The headquarters was organized on 2 September 1921 at 3d and Olive Streets in St. Louis, and relocated in 1923 to the Old Customhouse. The HQ remained there until activated for World War II. To encourage esprit de corps, the division adopted the nickname “Ozark” after the mountainous region that ran through both home area states, and the division staff published a newsletter titled “Ozark.” The division formed rapidly and by November 1922, it was up to 95 percent strength in its complement of officers as required by its peacetime tables of organization. The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Fort Riley, KS. The HQ and staff usually trained at Fort Leavenworth, KS. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the 17th Infantry Regiment at Fort Leavenworth. In the 1920s and 1930s Harry S. Truman, a lieutenant colonel in the Officers' Reserve Corps, commanded the division's 1st Battalion, 379th Field Artillery Regiment. After promotion to colonel, Truman advanced to command of the 379th Field Artillery Regiment.

Keating, arrived on the Western Front in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at Cherbourg, France, 23 September 1944, and, after a short period of training near Valognes, moved to the German-Netherlands border. On 26 October, elements attached to other divisions entered combat and on 3 November the division assumed responsibility for the sector from the Wurm to Waurichen. A realignment of sectors and the return of elements placed the 102nd in full control of its units for the first time, 24 November 1944, as it prepared for an attack to the Roer. The attack jumped off, 29 November, and carried the division to the river through Welz, Flossdorf, and Linnich. After a period of aggressive patrolling along the Roer, 4–19 December, the division took over the XIII Corps sector from the Wurm River, north of the village of Wurm, to Barmen on the south, and trained for river crossing. On 23 February 1945, the 102d attacked across the Roer (Operation Grenade), advanced toward Lövenich and Erkelenz, bypassed Mönchengladbach, took Krefeld, 3 March, and reached the Rhine. During March the division was on the defensive along the Rhine, its sector extending from Homburg south to Düsseldorf. Crossing the river on 9 April on pontoon bridge, the division attacked in the Wesergebirge, meeting stiff opposition. After 3 days and nights of terrific enemy resistance Wilsede and Hessisch-Oldendorf fell, 12 April 1945, and the 102d pushed on to the Elbe, meeting little resistance. Breitenfeld fell, 15 April, and the division outposted the Elbe River, 48 miles from Berlin, its advance halted on orders. Storkau experienced fighting on the 16th, EHRA on the 21st along with Fallersleben. On 3 May 1945 the 102nd shook hands with the Russian 156th Division just outside Berlin. The barn set on fire in the Gardelegen Massacre On 15 April the division discovered a war crime in Gardelegen. About 1,200 prisoners from the Mittelbau-Dora and Hannover-Stöcken concentration camps were forced from a train into an empty barn measuring approximately a hundred by fifty feet on the outskirts of the town. The barn was then set afire, killing those inside. About 1,016 people were killed. However, two men survived, buried under a shield of dead bodies, protecting them from the gunfire and flames. When the first soldiers arrived at the barn, the two came crawling out from under the dead and burning bodies. Major General Keating ordered that the nearby civilian population be forced to view the site and to disinter and rebury the victims in a new cemetery. After digging the graves and burying the bodies, they erected a cross or a Star of David over each grave and enclosed the site with a white fence.U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. \\"The Year of 1945 Liberation,\\" Washington, D.C., 1945, pp. 69–70 The division patrolled and maintained defensive positions until the end of hostilities in Europe, then moved to Gotha for occupational duty. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 4,922Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths in World War II, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 932 *Wounded in action: 3,668 *Missing in action: 185 *Prisoners of war: 137 =Assignments in the European Theater of Operations= *28 August 1944: Ninth Army, 12th Army Group. *5 September 1944: III Corps. *10 October 1944: XVI Corps. *3 November 1944: XIX Corps. *7 November 1944: XIII Corps. *20 December 1944: XIII Corps, Ninth Army (attached to the British 21st Army Group), 12th Army Group. *1 April 1945: XIII Corps (for administration), Ninth Army, but attached for operations to the Fifteenth Army. *4 April 1945: XIII Corps, Ninth Army, 12th Army Group.

The officer and enlisted cadre came from the 85th Infantry Division at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and the enlisted fillers arrived from reception centers located across nearly the entire country, comprising installations in the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Service Commands (Camp Grant, Illinois, 4,060; Fort Custer, Michigan, 3,845; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 1,307; Camp Dodge, Iowa, 1,036; Fort Snelling, Minnesota, 990; Eighth and Ninth Service Command reception centers, 921; Fort Bragg, North Carolina, 600; Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, 600; Fort McPherson, Georgia, 537; Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, 526; Fort Jackson, South Carolina, 218). After nearly two years of training, the 103rd departed the United States for Europe on 5 October 1944. The division arrived at Marseilles, France, 20 October 1944. It relieved the 3d Division at Chevry on 8 November, arrived at Docelles (Vosges) on 9 November, and attacked west of St. Dié, 16 November, in its drive through the Vosges. Meeting heavy resistance all the way, it crossed the Meurthe River, took St. Dié, 23 November and captured Diefenbach on 29 November and Selestat on 4 December. The division crossed the Zintzel river at Griesbach, 10 December 1944. Pushing through Climbach, the 103d crossed the Lauter River into Germany, 15 December, and assaulted the outer defenses of the Siegfried Line. On 22 December, the division moved west to the Sarreguemines area where an active defense was maintained. The enemy offensive did not develop in its sector and the 103d moved to Reichshofen, 14 January 1945, to take up positions along the Sauer River. On 15 January, General Anthony \\"Nuts\\" McAuliffe was redeployed from the Battle of the Bulge and given command, which he retained until July 1945. Defensive patrols were active and a limited attack on Soufflenheim on 19 January was repulsed by the enemy. On 20 January, the division withdrew to the Moder and repulsed German advances near Muehlhausen, 23–25 January. The 103d's offensive began, 15 March 1945. Crossing the Moder and Zintzel rivers and taking Muehlhausen against sharp opposition, the division moved over the Lauter river and penetrated the defenses of the Siegfried Line. As German resistance disintegrated, the 103d reached the Upper Rhine Valley, 23 March, and engaged in mopping up operations in the plain west of the River Rhine. In April 1945, it received occupational duties until 20 April when it resumed the offensive, pursuing a fleeing enemy through Stuttgart and taking Münsingen on 24 April. On 27 April, elements of the division entered Landsberg, where Kaufering concentration camp, a subcamp of Dachau, was liberated.Report After Action: The Story of the 103d Infantry Division, Ralph Mueller and Jerry Turk; 1945, Wagner'sche Universitats- Buchdruckerie, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria; distributor, The Infantry Journal, Washington 6, D.

The 411th Infantry Regiment continued on to take the Brenner Pass and earn the honor of linking up with the 88th Infantry Division of the Fifth Army which had been fighting its way north up the Italian peninsula. Troops met at Vipiteno, Italy, near the Austrian border on 4 May 1945, joining the Italian and Western European fronts. After Victory in Europe Day the division received occupational duties until it left for home and inactivation. It returned to the continental U.S on 10 September 1945, and was inactivated on 22 September 1945 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 4,558Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths in World War II, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 720 *Wounded in action: 3,329 *Missing in action: 88 *Prisoner of war: 421 =Order of battle= Components of the 103rd Infantry Division included:Sources: 1.

A joy buzzer (also called a hand buzzer) is a practical joke device that consists of a coiled spring inside a disc worn in the palm of the hand. When the wearer shakes hands with another person, a button on the disc releases the spring, which rapidly unwinds creating a vibration that feels somewhat like an electric shock to someone not expecting it. History The joy buzzer was invented in 1928 by Soren Sorensen Adams of the S.S. Adams Co. It was modeled after another product, The Zapper, which was similar to the joy buzzer, but did not have a very effective buzz and contained a button that had a blunt point which would hurt the person whose hand was shaken. Adams brought a rather large prototype of his newly designed buzzer to Dresden, Germany, where a machinist created the tools that would make the parts for a new palm-sized Joy Buzzer. In 1932, the item received from the U.S. Patent Office. The instant success of the new item allowed Adams to move to a new building and increase the size of his company. Adams continued to send royalty payments to the tool and die maker until 1934, when the payments were returned. In 1987, Sam Adams' son, Joseph \\"Bud\\" Adams, redesigned the mechanism for great durability and a louder buzz, and marketed it as the Super Joy Buzzer. A common misconception—primarily due to false advertising by the makers and sellers of the device—is that the joy buzzer actually delivers an electric shock, and many stylized villains in fiction (e.g., Batman's nemesis The Joker) employ \\"lethally powerful\\" joy buzzers as weapons. An example is in Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse cartoon film Mickey's Rival (1936), wherein Mickey Mouse's hands are shocked by Mortimer Mouse's trousers. Another example is in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Pranks a Lot\\" (2004-10-11, S03E20b), wherein Patrick Star's hand is shocked by a joy buzzer, and in The Simpsons episode \\"Homer the Clown\\" (1995-02-12, S06E15), where Homer Simpson is shocked with it multiple times by Krusty the Clown to the point where he is tortured by it. However, a shocking pen does generate a mild electric shock when a victim presses the button on top; the pen can be turned to make it release the point.

Activated 15 April 1943, the division trained at Camp Blanding, Florida, and was later transferred to Camp Robinson, Arkansas and then later to Camp Rucker, Alabama before being shipped overseas to England on 26 November 1944. Commanded by Maj. Gen. H. F. Kramer, the 66th Infantry Division's main role in World War II was containing and eliminating the remaining pockets of German soldiers in Northern France. Combat chronicle Three regiments of the 66th Infantry Division arrived in Dorchester, England on 26 November 1944, and the rest of the Division joined them on 12 December 1944. They trained and prepared for deployment until 24 December 1944, then transferred to Southampton before crossing the English Channel to Cherbourg, France. Two transport vessels, SS Cheshire and the Belgian Leopoldville carried the 66th across the English Channel. However, only 5 miles from the port of Cherbourg, the Leopoldville was torpedoed by a German U-Boat and sunk, taking the lives of 14 officers and 748 enlisted soldiers. The U.S. Navy later announced the sinking of the Leopoldville to be the second-largest loss of life from the sinking of a troop transport ship in the entire European Theater. Primarily involved with destroying the German troops left behind by the retreat from Northern France, the 66th Infantry Division relieved the 94th Infantry Division of control of the Brittany-Loire area on 29 December 1944, and collaborated with French forces as well. The 66th carried out its objective by harassing German installations, limited objective attacks, and running reconnaissance missions to gather intelligence. The use of artillery shelling many German positions also played a major part in the advancement of the 66th through the region. In total, there were about 100,000 German soldiers that remained in the ports of Lorient, St. Nazaire, Royan and La Rochelle. Notably, a heavy German attack near La Croix was repulsed on 16 April 1945 and several strongly fortified enemy positions were taken from 19 to 29 April 1945 in a series of counterattacks. These battles played a pivotal role in ending the Nazi occupation of Northern France. The remaining German soldiers surrendered to 66th Infantry Division officers and French officials in a small cafe near Cordemais on 8 May 1945. Ordered to change to an occupational-oriented mission 14 May 1945, the 66th made a 700-mile trek into Germany where the Black Panthers occupied 2400 square miles of territory and the city of Koblenz. As a security force, the division was charged with establishment of a military government and control of all German affairs. Tasks included the dischargement of prisoners of war, inventorying of ammunition and supplies, and organizing civilians. After spending time in Germany, the 66th returned to the French coast to aid with the allied withdrawal from the European Theater. During this time, the division was changed by the beginning of the inactivation process, until it returned to the U.S. and formally inactivated, sailing for home 27 October 1945. =Order of battle= The division consisted of these units: * Headquarters, 66th Infantry Division * 262d Infantry Regiment * 263d Infantry Regiment * 264th Infantry Regiment * Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 66th Infantry Division Artillery **721st Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) **870th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) **871st Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) **872d Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) * 266th Engineer Combat Battalion * 366th Medical Battalion * 66th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized) * Headquarters, Special Troops, 66th Infantry Division ** Headquarters Company, 66th Infantry Division ** 766th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company ** 66th Quartermaster Company ** 566th Signal Company ** Military Police Platoon ** Band * 66th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment The 422d and 423d Infantry Regiments (from the 106th Infantry Division) were attached to the division from 15 April to 15 May 1945.World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946 by Shelby Stanton. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 1,452Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 795 (Includes Leopoldville disaster) *Wounded in action: 636 *Prisoner of war: 21 Tragic Drowning On 17 March 1944, the unit was practicing amphibious maneuvers on Lake 2 in the Lakewood (now part of North Little Rock, Arkansas) when the incident took place.

Much of it is the Davison Freeway, the nation's first urban depressed freeway, which became a connector between the Lodge (M-10) and the Chrysler (Interstate 75, I-75) freeways. Named for an English immigrant to the area, Davison Avenue was originally the only street connecting across Highland Park to Detroit. It was rebuilt by the city and Wayne County as a freeway during World War II. The roadway was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 1993 and numbered as M-8. Subsequent changes by the state rebuilt the freeway and extended the M-8 designation to connect to the Jeffries Freeway (I-96). Route description M-8 starts on the western end at an interchange with I-96 in Detroit. Davison Avenue continues west of this interchange forming a service drive for the freeway while M-8 uses a short section of freeway to connect between I-96 and Davison Avenue. This short freeway segment runs easterly to Livernois Avenue where the trunkline transitions into Davison Avenue. East of this transition, the roadway turns northeasterly running through residential areas of Detroit. The trunkline meets M-10/Lodge Freeway on the border between Detroit and Highland Park, a city surrounded by Detroit. Northeast of this interchange, M-8 becomes the Davison Freeway, running depressed below the level of the cross streets. There are interchanges for M-1/Woodward Avenue and Oakland Avenue before meeting the Chrysler Freeway (I-75) on the eastern border of Highland Park. The Davison Freeway continues northeasterly in Detroit north of Hamtramck. The freeway ends between Gallagher and Newbern avenues. M-8 continues to Conant Street where the designation ends. Davison Avenue continues past Mound Road where it turns back due east until it ends at Van Dyke Street next to the Mt. Olivet Cemetery. MDOT's 2007 traffic surveys counted the average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of the number of vehicles using a section of roadway on any given day of the year. An average of 38,000 vehicles used the western section of M-8 along Davison Avenue in 2007 each day; the eastern segment carried 37,300 vehicles. The section of freeway in between carried in excess of 50,000 vehicles a day in 2007 between M-10 and I-75. Of this traffic, 1,900 trucks and other commercial vehicles used the trunkline. History Davison Avenue predates both the Davison Freeway and the M-8 state trunkline designation in the area. The roadway was named for Jarad Davison, an English immigrant and one of the early settlers of the area. The street was the only one of the 30 parallel streets in Highland Park that crossed through the city from border to border and connected with Detroit streets. This road was heavily congested, approaching gridlock during rush hour by 1940. A traffic survey showed that 96% of the traffic using the street was crossing Highland Park with no destination in the city. A proposal to rebuild the street as a six-lane, limited-access highway was approved by the Highland Park City Council on March 17, 1941. The council also appropriated $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the construction with Wayne County and the remaining $3,400,000 (equivalent to $ in ) paid by state and federal government appropriations. The freeway construction required a half-block of right-of-way on the south side of Davison Avenue and the demolition of 69 homes to accommodate the of excavation along the project. Another 63 homes were moved. The outbreak of World War II accelerated the construction schedule after the project was given priority due to the defense plants near the roadway. The freeway opened for traffic without a dedication ceremony at 4:00 p.m. on November 25, 1942. Travel times across Highland Park dropped from 15 minutes to around 3–4 minutes after the freeway opened. The roadway was the first urban, depressed freeway in the United States. The concrete for the road bed was cured underwater by flooding, creating an extremely hard and durable surface which lasted for more than 50 years (some requiring dynamite for its eventual removal). The Davison (M-8) In 1968, the freeway was extended eastward a few blocks through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed for a year and a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997, by Governor John Engler. In 2001, M-8 was extended to include the segment of Davison Avenue between the freeway's western terminus and Davison Avenue's junction with I-96 (Jeffries Freeway). Except for a M-8 shield on the Lodge Freeway's Davison Avenue exit signs, the non-freeway portion of M-8 remains unsigned, including at the Davison Avenue exit from the Jeffries where new Clearview signs were erected as part of a large I-96 reconstruction project in 2005.

The division arrived in Liverpool on 17 April and began training in amphibious operations. After training in the United Kingdom from 17 April 1944, the 79th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy, 12–14 June and entered combat 19 June 1944, with an attack on the high ground west and northwest of Valognes and high ground south of Cherbourg. The division took Fort du Roule after a heavy engagement and entered Cherbourg, 25 June. It was around this time that Corporal John D. Kelly and First Lieutenant Carlos C. Ogden, both of the 314th Infantry Regiment, were awarded the Medal of Honor.https://history.army.mil/html/reference/Normandy/nor-moh.html It held a defensive line at the Ollonde River until 2 July 1944 and then returned to the offensive, taking La Haye du Puits in house-to-house fighting, 8 July. On 26 July, the 79th attacked across the Ay River, took Lessay, crossed the Sarthe River and entered Le Mans, 8 August, meeting only light resistance. The advance continued across the Seine, 19 August. Heavy German counterattacks were repelled, 22–27 August, and the division reached the Therain River, 31 August. Moving swiftly to the Franco-Belgian frontier near St. Amand (east of Lille), the division was then moved to XV Corps in eastern France, where it encountered heavy resistance in taking Charmes in street fighting, 12 September. The 79th cut across the Moselle and Meurthe Rivers, 13–23 September, cleared the Forêt de Parroy in a severe engagement, 28 September–9 October, and attacked to gain high ground east of Emberménil, 14–23 October, when it was relieved, 24 October. After rest and training at Lunéville, the division returned to combat with an attack from the MignevineMontiguy area, 13 November 1944, which carried it across the Vezouse and Moder Rivers, 18 November–10 December, through Haguenau in spite of determined enemy resistance, and into the Siegfried Line, 17–20 December. The division held a defensive line along the Lauter River, at Wissembourg from 20 December 1944 until 2 January 1945, when it withdrew to Maginot Line defenses. The German attempt to establish a bridgehead west of the Rhine at Gambsheim resulted in furious fighting. The 79th beat off German attacks at Hatten and Rittershoffen in an 11-day battle before withdrawing to new defensive positions south of Haguenau on the Moder River, 19 January 1945. The division remained on the defensive along the Moder until 6 February 1945. During February and March 1945, the division mopped up German resistance, returned to offensive combat, 24 March 1945, crossed the Rhine, drove across the Rhine-Herne Canal, 7 April, secured the north bank of the Ruhr and took part in clearing the Ruhr Pocket until 13 April. The division then went on occupation duty, in the Dortmund, Sudetenland, and Bavarian areas successively, until its return to the United States and inactivation. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 15,203Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 2,476 *Wounded in action: 10,971 *Missing in action: 579 *Prisoner of war: 1,186 =Assignments in European Theater of Operations= *18 April 1944: VIII Corps, Third Army. *29 May 1944: Third Army but attached to VII Corps, First Army. *30 June 1944: Third Army, but attached to First Army. *1 July 1944: VIII Corps. *1 August 1944: VIII Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group. * 8 August 1944: XV Corps. *24 August 1944: XV Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group, but attached to First Army. *26 August 1944: XV Corps, First Army, 12th Army Group. *29 August 1944: XII Corps. *7 September 1944: XV Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group. *29 September 1944: Third Army, 12th Army Group, but attached to the XV Corps, Seventh Army, 6th Army Group. *25 November 1944: XV Corps, Seventh Army, 6th Army Group. *5 December 1944: VI Corps. * 6 February 1945: Seventh Army, 6th Army Group. * 17 February 1945: Seventh Army, 6th Army Group, but attached to the XVI Corps, Ninth Army, 12th Army Group. *1 March 1945: XIII Corps. *7 March 1945: XVI Corps. * 7 April 1945: XVI Corps, Ninth Army, 12th Army Group. 79th Sustainment Support Command The 79th Infantry Division is now the 79th Sustainment Support Command (SSC) headquartered at Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) Los Alamitos, California.

It is the opposite of the usually pervasive better-than-average effect (in contexts where the two are compared or the overconfidence effect in other situations). It has been proposed more recently to explain reversals of that effect, where people instead underestimate their own desirable traits. This effect seems to occur when chances of success are perceived to be extremely rare. Traits which people tend to underestimate include juggling ability, the ability to ride a unicycle, the odds of living past 100 or of finding a U.S. twenty dollar bill on the ground in the next two weeks. Some have attempted to explain this cognitive bias in terms of the regression fallacy or of self-handicapping. In a 2012 article in Psychological Bulletin it is suggested the worse-than- average effect (as well as other cognitive biases) can be explained by a simple information-theoretic generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).

Inside Nextel Cup was hosted by Dave Despain. The show was taped every Monday morning at Speed's studios in Charlotte, North Carolina about 11 am, unless a race is postponed to Monday, in which case the show takes place live. The show usually ran for 60 minutes, except for a brief period during the first few weeks of the 2005 season, when it ran for 90 minutes. Speed Channel chose to discontinue this show at the end of the 2007 NASCAR season, replacing it in 2008 with the similar program This Week in NASCAR. History Inside Nextel Cup originally broadcast on SpeedVision, and was called Inside Winston Cup until the title-sponsor change in 2004. The show was also rebroadcast on several Fox Sports Net affiliates when the show was on SpeedVision, but was exclusively on Speed from 2002 to 2007. The first episode aired after the 1996 Daytona 500. The original host was Allen Bestwick, who then broadcast races on Motor Racing Network. The original panelists were chosen because they each drove a different make of race car; Michael Waltrip drove a Ford, Ken Schrader drove a Chevrolet, and Johnny Benson drove a Pontiac. The show has been so popular that when Fox, NBC, and TNT signed a television deal to broadcast NASCAR races starting in 2001, thousands of emails and faxes came in to ask that the show be saved. The show went on hiatus after NASCAR embargoed all race footage from non-NASCAR broadcast partners, meaning that there would be no highlight show on Speed. But the death of Dale Earnhardt in the 2001 Daytona 500, plus various changes in NASCAR, prompted Speed producers to tape a special reunion program. The program, called \\"One More Time\\", involved only the regular panelists and frequent substitute Kenny Wallace, shooting on location at Schrader's home on Lake Norman in North Carolina. But when Speed became an official broadcast partner of NASCAR, the show began broadcasting again in 2002. It also had a spin-off, as Inside NBS debuted in 2003. The show was mostly devoted to the Busch Series, NASCAR's version of Triple-A baseball. Bestwick was joined by panelists Hank Parker, Jr. and Randy LaJoie. It only lasted one season. =Original show format= The show would show the previous day's races, with Bestwick reading notes while the highlights were shown. The panel would then analyze the action taking place in the on-screen video, whether it's a pass for position or a crash. Sometimes, a member of the panel has to analyze a mishap he himself had, which leads Bestwick and the other two panelists to tease him about it. Other times, though, the panelist will be shown in a moment of success on the track. Also, there are times when two of the panelists will watch themselves in a battle for position, or being caught up in the same crash. After the race highlights, a now-discontinued interview segment called \\"The Hot Seat\\" would take place, in which Bestwick and the panel asked the guest questions (and sometimes ribbed him in a friendly way). Guests ranged from drivers to NASCAR officials to even singer-songwriter Edwin McCain, who performed on the segment in July 2004. Often, the Hot Seat guest would stick around as the latest news and action in the NASCAR Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series is recapped. Other assorted segments filled out the rest of the hour. Sometimes, a Speed camera crew would follow Michael Waltrip to various events, including a hilarious segment at an Iowa pumpkin farm. Another segment, SpeedFan Q&A;, led to some answers and a few non-answers. The next Cup race would be previewed in detail, and, in the last few seconds of the show, the panelists would plug an appearance they are making later in the week. =Final show format= On September 5, 2005, a major (and controversial) change took place -- Bestwick, removed from his hosting duties, hosted his last show, and was replaced by Dave Despain, who hosts Speed's WindTunnel with Dave Despain. Benson, a panelist on the show from the beginning, was replaced by Brian Vickers. Benson was not present for Bestwick's last show. After the 2006 season, Vickers was dropped from the show, and Greg Biffle was announced as his replacement. With Despain as host, the formula of the show changed. The show focuses almost exclusively on Nextel Cup, especially during the 10 weeks of the Chase for the Nextel Cup. The \\"Hot Seat\\" segment was dropped in favor of a remote interview with either the winning driver or winning crew chief from the previous week's race. The show became much more tightly controlled (with the panelists holding clipboards and notepads now) and less spontaneous. The segment previewing the next Cup race has been dropped, and no show was taped in 2006 during off-weeks. Inside Nextel Cup has been parodied in a commercial for Aaron's, where Despain, Waltrip, and Schrader comment on a pair of shoppers going through an Aaron's store. =This Week in NASCAR= Inside Nextel Cup was replaced in 2008. Veteran NASCAR personality Steve Byrnes took over hosting duties on the newly named This Week in NASCAR, which premiered February 18. This Week in NASCAR replaced the NASCAR Sprint Cup race re-cap and analysis show, moving into a \\"handoff\\" position between events, reviewing topical items from previous races in all three NASCAR national touring series, while also looking forward to upcoming events. Familiar faces, including Michael Waltrip, Greg Biffle and Ken Schrader remained as regular Monday night panelists, with NASCAR crew chiefs, including three-time champ Chad Knaus also joining the show. Incidents * In 2000, Darrell Waltrip came on the show as a special guest and Allen Bestwick could barely get a word in edgewise to get to commercial. * In 2003, after Michael Waltrip won the Daytona 500, he couldn't make the show because of the numerous television appearances mandated of the champion. He appeared via satellite from Daytona USA, and started his segment with Allen Bestwick, mouthing silently, \\"I'm just so pleased, so happy to have won the race.\\" Then, he vocalized the words, \\"I was just fakin'.\\" The entire studio burst into laughter at the practical joke. * In 2004, the earpiece that the control room uses to talk to each driver fell in Michael Waltrip's ear canal. A crew member with a long pair of tweezers was dispatched to fish it out. * In 2005, a power-washing crew started its work during the show's taping. The show kept rolling, and Allen Bestwick, continuing on a theme of rude driving and behavior of some drivers, quipped, \\"Now, that's rude.\\" Inside Nextel Cup Category:Speed (TV network) original programming Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:2007 American television series endings Category:2000s American television series Category:NASCAR Cup Series ","title":"NASCAR Inside Nextel Cup"},{"id":"889573","text":"Outer Subcarpathian regions (section I. outlined in red) Outer Subcarpathian regions (section II. outlined in red) Outer Subcarpathia (; , Prykarpattia; ; ) denotes the depression area at the outer (western, northern and eastern) base of the Carpathian arc, including foothills of the Outer Western Carpathians and Outer Eastern Carpathians.

Sutherland was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Essex North in the 1900 election. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections. He was born in Newmarket in Canada West in 1859. After studies at the University of Toronto and University of Western Ontario, Sutherland began his career as a lawyer in Windsor, Ontario. He was a member of the city council, and first ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in 1900 and was elected. During the campaign in a riding with a large francophone and Catholic population, he was accused of having been a member of the anti-Catholic Protestant Protective Association. While he admitted having attended a meeting out of curiosity, he insisted that he refused to join the group upon learning of its anti-Catholic views. Once elected, he concentrated on constituency issues and obtaining grants for his riding. By the time of the next general election in 1904, Sutherland had learned some French and was able to campaign in the language. Following the election, he was nominated by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to become Speaker of the House, and was the first anglophone Speaker to give part of his acceptance speech in French. Laurier offered to renominate Sutherland for the Speakership following the 1908 election, but he declined, and was appointed the next year to a seat on Ontario's High Court. He became a respected judge and mediator. He was later appointed to chair a Royal Commission in Ontario to investigate a proposal by Sir Adam Beck to establish a network of radial lines (that is, a system of inter-city streetcar lines). Sutherland's report argued against the scheme and it was not implemented.

It is a popular snack across the Indian subcontinent, where it is served in restaurants and sold by street vendors. It is also often found in Indian restaurants as well as South Asian restaurants in the Western world. Etymology The word pakoṛā is derived from Sanskrit पक्ववट pakvavaṭa, a compound of pakva ('cooked') and vaṭa ('a small lump') or its derivative vaṭaka, 'a round cake made of pulse fried in oil or ghee'. Pakora in Jaipur. Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word. The sound is a hard 'da' in the Telugu language and the 'ra' sound would be an incorrect pronunciation. The sound is the retroflex flap , which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter ड़, and in Urdu with letter ڑ. However, in the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, the Hindi letter ड़ is transliterated as <ṛ>, popular or non-standard transliterations of Hindi use for this sound, because etymologically, it derives from ड . The occurrence of this consonant in the word pakora has given rise to two common alternative spellings in English: pakoda, which reflects its etymology, and pakora, which reflects its phonology. Names In Maharashtra it is known as bhaji, in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and Karnataka, such preparations are known as bajji rather than pakora. Usually, the name of the vegetable that is deep- fried is prefixed to bajji. For instance, potato bajji is sliced potato wrapped in batter and deep-fried. In these Indian states, pakoda is taken to mean a mix of finely chopped onions, green chilis, and spices mixed in gram flour. This is then rolled into small balls or sprinkled straight in hot oil and deep-fried. Pakodas are very crisp on the outside and medium soft to crisp inside. There is a variety that is softer overall, usually termed media pakoda in restaurants, that is made from any other ingredient, such as potatoes. Preparation Pakoras are created by choosing one or two main ingredients, such as onion, eggplant, potato, spinach, plantain, paneer, cauliflower, tomato, or chili pepper. They are also occasionally prepared with bread, buckwheat, groundnut, fish, or chicken. They are dipped in a batter made from gram flour (chickpea / garbanzo bean flour) and then deep-fried. The most popular varieties include pyaaz pakora, made from onion, and aloo pakora, made from potato. Other variations include paalak pakora, made from spinach, and paneer pakora, made from paneer (soft cottage cheese). When onions, on their own, are prepared in the same way, they are known as onion bajji. A variation of pakora made from gram flour, fenugreek leaves and salt is called \\"Fulavda\\", popular preparation of \\"bhajiya\\" in Gujarat. Another variation is made with wheat flour, salt, and tiny bits of potato or onion (optional), is called noon bariya (nūn = salt) (), typically found in eastern Uttar Pradesh in India. Serving Pakoras are usually served as a snack or appetiser. They are also often served with masala chai to guests arriving to attend Indian wedding ceremonies, and are usually complemented with tamarind, chutney or raita. In the United Kingdom, pakoras are popular as a fast-food snack, available in restaurants that serve cuisines from the Indian subcontinent.

Overview  People display an impact bias when they overestimate the intensity and durability of affect when making predictions about their emotional responses. It is a cognitive bias that has been found in populations ranging from college students (e.g. Dunn, Wilson, & Gilbert, 2003; Buehler & McFarland, 2001), to sports fans (Wilson et al, 2000), to registered voters (Gilbert et al, 1998). = Affective Forecasting = Research shows that people often make errors about how much positive or negative effect an event will have on us. People mispredict their emotional reactions (how much pleasure or displeasure an event will bring them) when they mispredict how the event will occur. These mistaken projections can lead to mistaken assumptions about the impact of an event on their happiness. Generally, people accurately predict the valence, if an event will generate a positive or negative reaction, but people are less accurate in their predictions about the intensity and the duration of these effects. = Mistaken projections = To make decisions, people try to predict how an event will play out and what it will make them feel. However, when making these predictions, people are subject to many cognitive biases, including the impact bias. Research shows that people’s projections are often mistaken (e.g. Wilson & Gilbert, 2005; Buehler & McFarland, 2001; Loewenstein & Schake, 1999). Early studies revealed that this phenomena is a result of people’s inability to anticipate how their feelings will be affected by external factors, and change over time (e.g. Kahneman, 1994). People are more prone to make errors about intensity and duration of affect, then about valence. These mistaken projections affect people’s ability to make decisions that maximize their happiness.  Example  In Gilbert et al., 1998, there was a conducted study on individuals participating in a job interview. The participants were separated into two groups; the unfair decision condition (where the decision of being hired was left up to a single MBA student with sole authority listening to the interview) and the fair decision condition (where the decision was made by a team of MBA students who had to independently and unanimously decide the fate of the interviewee). Then, certain participants were chosen to forecast how they would feel if they were chosen or not chosen for the job immediately after learning if they had been hired or fired and then they had to predict how they would feel ten minutes after hearing the news. Then following the interview, all participants were given letters notifying them they had not been selected for the job. All participants were then required to fill out a questionnaire that reported their current happiness. Then after waiting ten minutes, the experimenter presented all the participants with another questionnaire that once again asked them to report their current level of happiness. The predictions made by the participants in both the unfair and fair groups were about the same regarding how they would feel immediately after hearing the news as well as ten minutes later. Both groups accurately predicted how they would feel immediately after hearing the news. The study showed that both groups felt much better than they had originally predicted, ten minutes later, demonstrating the impact bias.  Causes  Explanations for the occurrence of the impact bias include the following: = Misconstrual Problem = Misconstrual of future events: When predicting how an experience will impact us emotionally, events which have not been experienced are particularly difficult. Often how we think an event may be like does not relate to how the experience is like. People know that the future is uncertain, but fail to recognize their projections as construals, subjective perceptions or interpretations of reality. (Griffin & Ross, 1998; Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). Misconstruals can be responsible for a great range of mispredictions because there is no limit to the degree of error one can make. It leads to the impact bias when misconstruals are accurate about the valence of an event, but overpredict intensity and duration of emotional reaction. Inaccurate theories: People have created cultural theories and had experiences that greatly influence beliefs of how an event will affect us. For example, our culture has emphasized a correlation between wealth and happiness, however despite this belief; money does not necessarily bring happiness. Motivated Distortions: When faced with a negative event people may have forecasts that are overestimated and can evoke either comfort or fear in the present. The overestimation however can often be used to soften the effects of an event or make it easier by the reality not being as extreme as the forecasted impact. Under correction (anchoring and adjustment): People anchor their prediction on how they currently feel and never accurately adjust their predictions. An illustrative example proposed by Wilson and Gilbert (2005), is that if you are currently in bed with a cold, and are invited to a party a month from now, it will be very difficult to separate your negative feelings from your prediction of how you will feel on a Saturday night a month later. This process is sometimes referred to as the projection bias (Loewenstein et al.,1999) whereby people’s affective forecasts are unconsciously or consciously influenced by their current state. = Focalism = Often when making a prediction of the impact of an event people focus solely on the event in question. This ignores the fact that with the passage of time, other events will occur that influence happiness. Disregarding the effect of unrelated events on future thoughts emotions, leads to erroneous predictions of our emotional reactions. Whereby, since we are focusing on the impact on one specific event, we simultaneously overestimate the intensity and duration of our emotional reaction to that event and underestimate the effect of other unrelated events. However, we fail to consider that these unrelated events can moderate our emotional responses. = Distinction bias = Cognitive bias whereby people focus too much on the differences between two future events instead of the shared features. This bias leads to the impact bias when people focus too much on a distinction that does affect their future happiness instead of focusing on features that do. As a result, people overestimate the impact of that difference on their wellbeing. For example, a study asked college students to predict how happy they would be a year later if assigned to a desired or undesired dormitory. Results showed that the students largely overestimated their unhappiness when assigned to an undesired dormitory, as their overall happiness was nearly identical to those living in desired houses the following year. = Sense- making = People fail to recognize how quickly they will make sense of an event, thereby, failing to anticipate the deceleration of emotional reactions. Research suggests that there are four processes by which our psychological immune system deals with unpredicted and poorly understood events: First, they pay a lot of attention to the event, then, they react emotionally, they attempt to make sense of the event, and finally, they adapt emotionally. Failure to recognize that these processes will occur or how fast they will occur causes people to overestimate the impact (and the duration of impact) of such events. Immune Neglect: We have unconscious psychological processes such as ego defense, dissonance reductions, self-serving biases, etc. that will cushion the effects of a negative event. When making predictions, people are generally unaware of these unconscious processes, and fail to take them into account when making affective forecasts.  Consequences  In the context of decision-making, the impact bias has important consequences. When making decisions (ranging from deciding whether to move to California or not to deciding whether to bike or drive to work) , people attempt to predict the outcome of their decisions by projecting their emotional reactions to future events (e.g.: “How will this make me feel?”). Thereby, they base their decisions on affective forecasts (Wilson & Gilbert, 2005). Erroneous projections about future emotional reactions, such as overestimating the intensity and durability of affect (i.e.: impact bias) can lead to mistaken projections. These mistakes impact decisions, and misguide people into making decisions that are not compatible with their future states and may be harmful to their wellbeing. The impact bias can also result in error in recollecting memories. People display retrospective impact bias when they overestimate the intensity and duration of an emotional reaction to a past event. This can lead to errors in decision making because it can lead people overestimating how an event positively or negatively impacts their wellbeing. Furthermore, people are influenced by their current emotion when recalling their past emotions. This can explain why people do not learn from their mistakes, and make more accurate forecasts. The implications of this phenomena is that people make irrational or unbalanced decisions because they recollect that an example was positive (or negative), but fail to recollect the degree of positive (or negative) effect, leading to inaccurate cost-benefit analyses.  Development in children  Recent evidence suggests that 3, 4 and 5 year-old children show an impact bias for the intensity of their negative future emotions, but not their positive future emotions.

In recent years band members have self-consciously applied the label \\"Taik\\" (from Taiwanese + -k ending, as in punk, rock) to their music – a reference to the Taiwanese Taike (Trad.: 台客) subculture. The LTK stands for \\"Loh Tsui Kweh\\", an idiosyncratic spelling (in Taiwanese) of the name of the Choshui River in Taiwan, one that evokes nativist sentiments. The two guitar players – Tsai Hai-en (蔡海恩) and Ke Jen-chien (柯仁堅) – share lead vocals. Both attended National Taiwan University but left school early. Between the two of them they have driven the band's evolution. The critic Malaite attributes the group's early grunge influence to Tsai. In addition to Western influences, both of them are, in their own ways, steeped in local, traditionally working class genres. There is also a bass player and a drummer. LTK Commune's earlier music echoes the island's protest movements of the early 1990s. Earlier themes have consciously reflected environmentalist concerns and anti-authoritarian sentiments. With the decline of street protests and the onset of political liberalization, socially conscious themes have become less foregrounded. The band unabashedly supports Taiwan independence. Their songs often express the frustration of the Taiwanese working class male. Unapologetically sexual or scatological references and vulgar language are found in some songs, a characteristic embraced by the fans but found outrageous by some critics. Some critics detect a streak of male chauvinism, most notably in the song \\"Rape, Murder\\"; others consider the song as a study of the perverse psyche of a rapist-murderer. Much of the lyrics are in the native Taiwanese language, a choice consistent with the language's working class base, as well as the anti- Kuomintang Opposition culture. Spoken monologues reminiscent of traditional melodrama (such as Budaixi, Taiwanese opera) are a favored device in their narratives. LTK Commune's live performances are noted for their spontaneity and engagement with the crowd.

The bass note of the triad is also the root of the triad in this scenario; but this is not always the case with triads, such as in the case of inverted triads. A/A (alternately notated as A Major/A bass) notated in regular notation (on top) and tabulature (below). In music theory, the bass note of a chord or sonority is the lowest note played or notated. If there are multiple voices it is the note played or notated in the lowest voice (the note furthest in the bass.) Three situations are possible: # The bass note is the root or fundamental of the chord. The chord is in root position. # One of the other pitches of the chord is in the bass. This makes it an inverted chord # The bass note is not one of the notes in the chord. Such a bass note is an additional note, coloring the chord above it. The name of such a chord is also notated as a slash chord. Examples with bass note in red: C major chord in root position close position (C), open position (C), first inversion (E), second inversion (G), and cluster on C (C). In pre-tonal theory (Early music), root notes were not considered and thus the bass was the most defining note of a sonority. See: thoroughbass. In pandiatonic chords the bass often does not determine the chord, as is always the case with a nonharmonic bass.

Ordered into active military service at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma, the division, commanded by Major General John E. Sloan, arrived at Casablanca, French Morocco on 15 December 1943, and moved to Magenta, Algeria, on 28 December for intensive training. Destined to spend the war fighting on the Italian Front, the 88th Division arrived at Naples, Italy on 6 February 1944, and concentrated around Piedimonte d'Alife for combat training. An advance element went into the line before Monte Cassino on 27 February, and the entire division relieved the battered British 46th Infantry Division along the Garigliano River in the Minturno area on 5 March. A period of defensive patrols and training followed. The 88th formed part of Major General Geoffrey Keyes' II Corps, part of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. After being inspected by the Fifth Army commander on 5 May, the 88th Division, six days later, drove north to take Spigno, Mount Civita, Itri, Fondi, and Roccagorga, reached Anzio, 29 May, and pursued the enemy into Rome, being the first unit of the Fifth Army into the city on 4 June, two days before the Normandy landings, after a stiff engagement on the outskirts of the city. An element of the 88th is credited with being first to enter the Eternal City. After continuing across the Tiber to Bassanelio the 88th retired for rest and training, 11 June. The division went into defensive positions near Pomerance on 5 July, and launched an attack toward Volterra on the 8th, taking the town the next day. Laiatico fell on the 11th, Villamagna on the 13th, and the Arno River was crossed on the 20th although the enemy resisted bitterly. After a period of rest and training, the 88th Division, now commanded by Major General Paul Wilkins Kendall, opened its assault on the Gothic Line on 21 September, and advanced rapidly along the Firenzuola-Imola road, taking Mount Battaglia (Casola Valsenio, RA) on the 28th. The enemy counterattacked savagely and heavy fighting continued on the line toward the Po Valley. The strategic positions of Mount Grande and Farnetto were taken on 20 and 22 October. From 26 October 1944 to 12 January 1945, the 88th entered a period of defensive patrolling in the Mount Grande- Mount Cerrere sector and the Mount Fano area. From 24 January to 2 March 1945, the division defended the Loiano-Livergnano area and after a brief rest returned to the front. The drive to the Po Valley began on 15 April. Monterumici fell on the 17th after an intense artillery barrage and the Po River was crossed on 24 April, as the 88th pursued the enemy toward the Alps. The cities of Verona and Vicenza were captured on the 25th and 28th and the Brenta River was crossed on 30 April. The 88th was driving through the Dolomite Alps toward Innsbruck, Austria where it linked up with the 103rd Infantry Division, part of the U.S. Seventh Army, when the hostilities ended on 2 May 1945. The end of World War II in Europe came six days later. Throughout the war the 88th Infantry Division was in combat for 344 days. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 13,111Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 2,298 *Wounded in action: 9,225 *Missing in action: 941 *Prisoner of war: 647 =Units= Triangular Division example: 1942 U.S. infantry division.

TRUST shoulder patch Cold War and beyond The 88th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) was formed at Fort Snelling in January, 1968, as one of 18 ARCOMs which were organized to provide command and control to Army Reserve units. The initial area of responsibility for the 88th ARCOM included Minnesota and Iowa, and this area was later expanded to include Wisconsin. In 1996, when the Army Reserve's command structure was revised, the 88th Regional Support Command (88th RSC) was established at Fort Snelling. Its mission was to provide command and control for Reserve units in a six state region, which included Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. In addition, the 88th RSC ensured operational readiness, provided area support services, and supported emergency operations in its area of responsibility. In 2003, the Army Reserve's command structure was again revised, and the 88th Regional Readiness Command (88th RRC) was formed at Fort Snelling with responsibility for USAR units in the same six states included in the 88th RSC. Various Combat Support units mobilize and deploy to Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2003-mid 2004. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Fort Snelling, MN by disestablishing the 88th Regional Readiness Command. This recommendation was part of a larger recommendation to re-engineer and streamline the Command and Control structure of the Army Reserve that would create the Northwest Regional Readiness Command at Fort McCoy, WI. In 2008, the 88th Regional Readiness Command (88th RRC) moved to Ft McCoy Wisconsin. The mission was changed to provide base operations support to the new 19 state region, Welcome Home Warrior Ceremony's, and the Yellow Ribbon weekends. The units assigned to the 88th RSC include 6 Army Reserve Bands and the Headquarters Company. It may supervise the 643rd Area Support Group at Whitehall, Ohio. Current The division shoulder patch is worn by the United States Army Reserve 88th Readiness Division at Fort Snelling, Minnesota; the division lineage is perpetuated by the 88th RD. RDs such as the 88th have the same number as inactivated divisions and are allowed to wear the shoulder patch, and division lineage and honors are inherited by an RD. General *Shoulder patch: A blue (for Infantry) quatrefoil, formed by two Arabic numeral \\"8s\\". A rocker above it with the nickname \\"Blue Devils\\" was often worn. *During World War II, the Germans thought the 88th was an elite stormtrooper Division. This was most likely due to parallels between the \\"Blue Devil\\" nickname and patch rocker and the German SS's use of the Totenkopf death's head insignia.

Honey Nut Cheerios is a variation of Cheerios breakfast cereal, introduced in 1979 by Yandel Gonzalez, who was in the General Mills cereal company. Unlike the original Cheerios, the third variation is sweeter than the original, with a honey and almond flavor. The second variation is Cinnamon Nut Cheerios which was test marketed in 1976. While Honey Nut Cheerios used to be made with actual nuts, as of 2006, the nuts were discontinued, and natural flavor, from peach and apricot pit, is used instead. In 2011, Honey Nut Cheerios was the best-selling cereal in the United States. History Historically, Honey Nut Cheerios has participated in much the same promotional advertising as the original brand, while collaborating with the field of NASCAR and especially driver Bill Lester, in promoting healthy diets. In 1985, Baskin-Robbins introduced an ice cream flavor based on the cereal called Honey Nut Crunch. Promotional tie-ins included gift certificates in cereal boxes and special Honey Nut Crunch sundaes in stores. The first 7 series of Honey Nut Cheerios did not have the bee mascot on the box. It was not until series 8 that the bee appeared on the box ! Cereal boxes from 1979 without the bee are called 'pre-bee' and are very rare. General Mills has been active in the conservation of bees since 2011; in 2011, the company began investing in the Xerces Society to help promote biodiversity and pollinator conservation. In March 2017, General Mills announced the Buzz Bee image had been removed from boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios. Images of the new box showed a white empty space where Buzz Bee used to be. Below the image of the bowl of cereal, a plea to \\"Help Bring Back The Bees\\" was added. This was to raise awareness of pollinator decline. In the announcement, General Mills made note that 30% of ingredients they use depend on pollinators. As a part of this campaign, General Mills also plans to expand their pollinator habitat to 3,300 acres. This campaign has struck controversy in some environmental communities. Kathryn Turner, an ecologist, commented that the packages of seeds contain species that are invasive to some geographic locations, and urges individuals to become more educated before planting the seeds. Mascot and promotions Their mascot is an anthropomorphic bee, designed for the first commercials by Dean Yeagle at Zander's Animation Parlour in New York City. The bee did not have a name until 2000, when Kristine Tong, a fifth grade student from Coolidge, Texas, won a national contest to name the bee, dubbing him \\"BuzzBee\\". Buzz also appeared as the host in the Honey Nut Cheerios Spelling Bee game, which was named after the breakfast cereal. Buzz has also went through several different voice actors in his career. He was originally voiced by Arnold Stang until 1990. He was then voiced by Billy West, Charlie Schlatter, Jason Marsden and currently Oliver Wyman. Taglines Many of this cereal's taglines overlapped with each other. They were used on different advertisements. * It's a honey of an O. (1979–2004; 2014–present) * It's Honey Nut Cheerios!

Package nutritional information asserts that \\"three grams of soluble fiber daily from whole grain oat foods, like Honey Nut Cheerios, in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease . Honey Nut Cheerios has 0.75g per serving.\\" As with Cheerios, the American Heart Association certified the cereal as \\"heart-healthy\\" for meeting the food criteria for saturated fat and cholesterol content. Honey Nut Cheerios also contains more sugar (9.6 Grams/serving) than General Mills' Cheerios, which contain 1.2 Grams/serving. Of the top six ingredients three are sweeteners (sugar, brown sugar, and honey).Are Honey Nut Cheerios Healthy?

Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it received wilderness designation on February 24, 1978 through the passage of the Endangered American Wilderness Act and is part of Nez Perce National Forest. As part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Gospel Hump Wilderness is an area where human development and use are restricted and people are to remain only visitors. History The Nez Perce people lived in Idaho as early as 6000 BCE, and the area that is now the Gospel Hump Wilderness was used by them long before the arrival of settlers. In 1861 gold was discovered in Florence, Idaho, just outside the wilderness's boundary. A quartz vein at the base of Buffalo Hump was discovered in 1898, which sparked a gold rush before mining subsided in 1903. Remnants of mines and other structures remain in the wilderness. The wilderness was formally established on February 24, 1978 when Congress passed Public Law 95-237. Management When the Gospel Hump Wilderness is combined with the adjacent Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area and the surrounding unprotected inventoried roadless area, it is part of a wilderness-roadless area complex. To the north of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area lies the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area. These two large Wilderness areas are separated only by a single dirt road (the Magruder Corridor), connecting Red River, Idaho to Darby, Montana. Negating the Magruder Corridor, the Selway-Bitterroot, Gospel Hump and Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Areas constitute the largest intact piece of wildland in the United States outside of Alaska. A management plan was established in 1983 and provides guidance for the Forest Service on management of the wilderness. The Wilderness Act of 1964 enhanced the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage of the act ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, just as they are throughout the Nez Perce National Forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits. Recreation There are no roads in the wilderness, and motorized vehicles are prohibited. However, several unpaved roads provide access to the wilderness, but are usually only accessible during the summer months. No permits are required for recreational visits, but group size is limited to 20 people and 20 head of stock and there is a fourteen-day limit for camping at one site. In 1982 it was estimated that the wilderness had 29,000 recreation visitor days. Half of summer use is from hikers, half of which camp in the wilderness. The majority of visitors during the fall are hunters. Geography and geology Elevations in the wilderness range from at the Wind River pack bridge across the Salmon River to at the summit of Buffalo Hump. The Salmon River forms the southern border of the wilderness and separates it from the adjacent Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness. Several alpine lakes are located in high-elevation basins below the mountain peaks in the wilderness. Rock units in the wilderness include gneiss along the Salmon River, the Hood Quartzite and Yellowjacket Formation (Precambrian in age), and undifferentiated granite of the Idaho Batholith. Natural Resources The southern section of the wilderness is dry and sparsely forested, while the northern section is moist and heavily forested. Mean annual precipitation ranges from along the Salmon River to at higher elevations, and snowpacks can reach at higher elevations. At lower elevations ponderosa pine and cheat grass dominate, while higher elevations are covered by lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, and whitebark pine along with whortleberry and beargrass. The two parts of the wilderness are separated by the mountain divide for which the wilderness is named. Fish present in the wilderness include sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, rainbow trout, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, and smallmouth bass. Elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, black bears, mountain lions, mountain goats, gray wolves, moose, and bighorn sheep are large mammals found in the wilderness. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, provided proper permits are obtained in the appropriate season.

During the course of the show, host Dave Despain fielded telephone calls and read e-mail from viewers, some of them directed at the guest Despain is interviewing, which was done just after the first segment, titled \\"Hot Topics\\", which Despain reads the big stories from the racing world. After the interview segment, Despain did a segment just for him, titled \\"My Take\\", in which he gave his opinion on news from the racing world. There was also an award for the best e-mail or phone call from each show, as the winning viewer received a Despain bobblehead. It was a coveted prize among viewers. When WindTunnel debuted, the show aired Friday nights at 11 pm. The pilot episode was only a half-hour long. The time length was changed to an hour the very next week. In August 2003, WindTunnel expanded to four nights a week (Monday-Thursday) and moved to a 9 pm timeslot. In 2005, to the chagrin of some of the series' fans, WindTunnel was scaled back to one night a week, airing for two hours beginning at 9 pm on Sunday nights. In 2006, WindTunnel was scaled back to one hour. There have been special episodes of WindTunnel shown as part of the lead-up to the Daytona 500 and the Sprint All-Star Race. The 2006 season brought about guest co-hosts in the form of racing personalities like drivers (such as Tony Stewart, Mario Andretti) and journalists (such as David Hobbs, Robin Miller, Ed Hinton, and Bob Varsha). In 2009, Despain began to take breaks during the season; guest hosts such as Krista Voda, Tommy Kendall, and Robin Miller have presented the show while Despain was off. Before this, only Ralph Sheheen in 2004 had replaced Despain for an episode due to illness. The show would take a hiatus following the last NASCAR Sprint Cup race to late January during the racing off-season. During this time, best-of episodes titled WindTunnel: The Interviews were shown. Only the most popular interviews from the previous season were shown, which included interviews with NASCAR great Richard Petty, NASCAR star Jeff Gordon, and drag racing legend John Force. Starting in 2009 Golden Corral, an American restaurant chain, became the show's sponsor. Previous sponsors have been Carquest, an automobile parts store chain in 2007, and Alltel, a cell phone company in 2008.

It was used in several U.S. airports in a voluntary pilot phase and continues in operation in several airports around the country. It is administered by TTAC, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) office responsible for Secure Flight, the replacement for the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) and the canceled CAPPS II counter-terrorism system. Registered Traveler is a public and private partnership between the TSA and the Registered Traveler Interoperability Consortium (RTIC) providing rules and standards for private Enrollment Providers that sign up participants. At 11:00 p.m. PST on June 22, 2009, Clear (the largest of the three companies offering the Registered Traveler program) ceased operations because Clear and its parent company, Verified Identity Pass, Inc., filed for bankruptcy. The company was then acquired by Alclear LLC and \\"Clear lanes\\" were opened at Denver International Airport, Orlando International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and San Francisco International Airport. Clear is currently operating at 60 airports, airports, stadiums, and other venues nationwide as of January 2020. Overview The program seeks to identify passengers who pose a minimal security risk, and then provide those passengers an enhanced security checkpoint experience. Passengers will voluntarily pay a fee and submit to a background check to become a Registered Traveler. Passengers who pass the background check will be issued a smartcard credential for use at the security checkpoints of airports that participate in the program. Registered Travelers will have access to a reserved security lane and will enjoy a shorter wait at the security checkpoint. Other benefits, such as allowing Registered Travelers to keep their coats and shoes on and their laptops in their bags have also been discussed. Any U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident over the age of 18 can apply for membership, as can minors over the age of 12 with parental or guardian sponsorship. In order to prevent a terrorist with a clean background from compromising the system, the TSA requires that registered travelers undergo the normal TSA screening (baggage x-ray and personal metal detector), at the RT kiosk checkpoint. Additionally, Registered Travelers are not exempt from random secondary screening and may not bring prohibited items into secure areas of terminals.  Airports  These airports operated the Clear Registered Traveler program until June 2009 and currently other Registered Traveler programs: *Albany International Airport (ALB) *Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG), Terminal 3 *Denver International Airport (DEN) *Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport (GPT) *Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) *Indianapolis International Airport (IND) *Jacksonville International Airport (JAX) *LaGuardia International Airport (LGA), Delta/Northwest Terminal and B gates in the Central Terminal *Little Rock National Airport (LIT) *Logan International Airport (BOS) *John F.

Clear was founded by Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV. Clear had programs at Albany, Cincinnati, Denver, Dulles Washington D.C., Indianapolis, Little Rock, New York LaGuardia, New York JFK, Newark, Oakland, Orlando, Reagan Washington D.C., Salt Lake City, San Jose, San Francisco and Westchester Airports. On July 26, 2008, a laptop containing the names, addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers, and passport information of 33,000 Clear customers was reported stolen from a secured room in San Francisco International Airport. The information was on an unencrypted laptop, in contravention of TSA rules, although it was protected by two levels of password protection. As a result of the theft, TSA officials ordered Clear to inform affected customers, suspend enrollment of new customers, and cease use of unencrypted computers as well as secure devices until encryption can be installed, as required by TSA rules. Verified Identity Pass must submit an independent audit of its systems to the TSA before the company can register new customers. On August 4, 2008 TSA Suspends Verified Identity Pass, Inc. Clear Registered Traveler Enrollment On August 5, 2008, the laptop was found in the same room where it went missing. Officials are currently investigating whether any personal data was accessed as well as the circumstances of the reappearance. On June 22, 2009, Clear announced they would cease operations effective immediately, citing an inability of Verified Identity Pass, Inc to obtain necessary financing. The entire contents of Clear's Web site was removed and most pages redirected to this simple statement: > Clear Lanes Are No Longer Available. At 11:00 p.m. PST on June 22, 2009, > Clear will cease operations. Clear’s parent company, Verified Identity Pass, > Inc. has been unable to negotiate an agreement with its senior creditor to > continue operations. On July 6, 2009 Two law firms filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of customers of Clear’s parent company, Verified Identity Pass, Inc that suddenly shut down on June 22. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Verified Identity Pass Inc., by Schneider Wallace Cottrell Brayton Konecky LLP and Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP. The suit claims that by ceasing operations and not offering refunds, VIP committed conversion, fraud, breach of contract, negligence and unjust enrichment. Additional lawsuits since have focused upon demanding the return or destruction of personal information, social security numbers, credit card numbers, fingerprints and iris scans in addition to refunding membership fees. On April 16, 2010, Judge Stuart M. Bernstein of the U.S Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan granted approval to Alclear LLC to purchase the CLEAR assets after outbidding rival Henry Inc. On May 3, 2010, Verified Identity Pass was purchased by Alclear LLC. Alclear LLC has brought Clear back and honored the time left on all Clear's original customers whose membership may have been terminated before the end of their contracts. In November 2010, Clear re- opened in Denver and Orlando airports. , Clear is operational in nineteen cities. =iQueue= FLO Corporation has partnered with Cogent and iQueue to deliver RT solutions and services. They expected to bring back the Registered Traveler program in the \\"Fall of 2010\\" starting with Indianapolis International Airport, with further expansions planned after. The website still exists (flyiqueue.com) but the registered traveler enrollment is not as yet operational. FLO The FLO Corporation, in conjunction with FLO Alliance partners, provides biometric identification technologies and credentialing processes for use in airports in accordance with the Registered Traveler program. Final enrollment centers are located in the Washington, D.C. area, or by on-location appointment for corporate accounts. RtGo RtGo was operated by Unisys Corporation (It had been bought out by FLO and was being operated by IRAM Associates). Membership was $100 per year, with option to prepay for up to 5 years. Shortly after the buyout, the company went out of business and was shut down in July 2009. The office at the Reno/Tahoe International Airport is no longer in use and both enrollment and special RTGo lines are no longer in use. The verification kiosks have also been removed. Instead, business travelers are encouraged to utilize the business (black diamond) lane at the checkpoint. =Preferred Traveler= The Preferred Traveler program is run by Vigilant Solutions, a Jacksonville Beach based company. The company’s program differentiates itself by adding a suite of value-added services for the traveler. Identifying information Passengers who participate in this system must first provide personal biographical information including name, address, phone number, citizenship status, and previous addresses, along with other information. The biographical information will be collected by a commercial Registered Traveler service provider. The biographical portion of the enrollment may be accomplished via a secure web site. Next, the applicant will proceed to the biometric phase of the enrollment process. During biometric enrollment applicants will present identification documents and fingerprints. Applicants may also choose to have an image of their iris taken if they wish to use an iris image as an alternative to a fingerprint scan at the security checkpoint. The iris image is totally non-invasive to the eye. Once the biometric enrollment is complete, the service provider submits the collected data to the TSA which performs a Security Threat Assessment (STA) of the applicant. If the assessment does not indicate that the applicant is suspected of posing a risk to aviation security, the TSA will return an approved STA result to the service provider. The service provider will then provide the passenger with a Registered Traveler card. The card will be a smartcard, containing biometric information to prevent the card from being used by unauthorized persons. This card will then be inserted into a verification kiosk at the special checkpoints, which will verify the passengers biometrics (fingerprint or iris scan) and acknowledge membership and clearance to proceed to RT screening. Controversy =Privacy= This system, like the related Secure Flight, has come under fire for its privacy implications although less so because Registered Traveler unlike Secure Flight is voluntary. The potential effectiveness has also been questioned. On the privacy front Registered Traveler collects far more information than Secure Flight including biometrics. While supporters assert that this program is voluntary, critics assert that RT's extensive background checks will be misused. The privacy safeguards and rules can be found in the RTIC specification and the TSA RT Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). Many airports and airlines already offer access to shorter \\"priority\\" security lines to first class or other status travelers without requiring any background checks. =Effectiveness= Similar to the concerns raised about CAPPS and CAPPS II, critics point out that any program designed to exclude certain passengers from scrutiny will provide a backdoor for potential terrorists, since they would likely seek Registered Traveler status. This criticism draws on the 9/11 Commission finding that 9 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11, 2001 attacks were flagged by the CAPPS I system but were not intercepted, because security was focused on luggage bombs. However, those participating in the Registered Traveler Program currently pass through the same security checkpoints and are screened the same as any other individual, the main difference being RT members enjoy a much shorter wait before screening. Currently RT programs do not offer a reduced security check, but their announced plans indicate they intend to offer this if airport officials allow it. =Fairness= Because the Registered Travelers Program, in its current form, does not exempt members from any of the security checks of the TSA, it is often criticized as merely being a method by which frequent travelers can pay an annual fee to a private company in order to be permitted to move to the head of the TSA line and not wait their turn along with less frequent travelers. Since the TSA lines are a government program (funded by equal payments on tickets of frequent travelers and non-travelers), this strikes many as being unfair to less frequent travelers.

Default logic can express facts like “by default, something is true”; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false. This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: “birds typically fly”. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified. Default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions. Syntax of default logic A default theory is a pair \\\\langle W, D \\\\rangle. is a set of logical formulas, called the background theory, that formalize the facts that are known for sure. is a set of default rules, each one being of the form: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Prerequisite : Justification}_1, \\\\dots , \\\\mathrm{Justification}_n}{\\\\mathrm{Conclusion}} According to this default, if we believe that is true, and each of \\\\mathrm{Justification}_n is consistent with our current beliefs, we are led to believe that is true. The logical formulae in and all formulae in a default were originally assumed to be first- order logic formulae, but they can potentially be formulae in an arbitrary formal logic. The case in which they are formulae in propositional logic is one of the most studied. =Examples= The default rule “birds typically fly” is formalized by the following default: :D = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Bird}(X) : \\\\mathrm{Flies}(X)}{\\\\mathrm{Flies}(X)} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} This rule means that, \\"if is a bird, and it can be assumed that it flies, then we can conclude that it flies\\". A background theory containing some facts about birds is the following one: :W = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathrm{Bird}(\\\\mathrm{Condor}), \\\\mathrm{Bird}(\\\\mathrm{Penguin}), eg \\\\mathrm{Flies}(\\\\mathrm{Penguin}), \\\\mathrm{Flies}(\\\\mathrm{Bee}) \\\\\\\\}. According to this default rule, a condor flies because the precondition is true and the justification is not inconsistent with what is currently known. On the contrary, does not allow concluding : even if the precondition of the default is true, the justification is inconsistent with what is known. From this background theory and this default, cannot be concluded because the default rule only allows deriving from , but not vice versa. Deriving the antecedents of an inference rule from the consequences is a form of explanation of the consequences, and is the aim of abductive reasoning. A common default assumption is that what is not known to be true is believed to be false. This is known as the Closed World Assumption, and is formalized in default logic using a default like the following one for every fact . : \\\\frac{:{ eg}F}{{ eg}F} For example, the computer language Prolog uses a sort of default assumption when dealing with negation: if a negative atom cannot be proved to be true, then it is assumed to be false. Note, however, that Prolog uses the so-called negation as failure: when the interpreter has to evaluate the atom eg F, it tries to prove that is true, and conclude that eg F is true if it fails. In default logic, instead, a default having eg F as a justification can only be applied if eg F is consistent with the current knowledge. =Restrictions= A default is categorical or prerequisite-free if it has no prerequisite (or, equivalently, its prerequisite is tautological). A default is normal if it has a single justification that is equivalent to its conclusion. A default is supernormal if it is both categorical and normal. A default is seminormal if all its justifications entail its conclusion. A default theory is called categorical, normal, supernormal, or seminormal if all defaults it contains are categorical, normal, supernormal, or seminormal, respectively. Semantics of default logic A default rule can be applied to a theory if its precondition is entailed by the theory and its justifications are all consistent with the theory. The application of a default rule leads to the addition of its consequence to the theory. Other default rules may then be applied to the resulting theory. When the theory is such that no other default can be applied, the theory is called an extension of the default theory. The default rules may be applied in different order, and this may lead to different extensions. The Nixon diamond example is a default theory with two extensions: : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Republican}(X): eg \\\\mathrm{Pacifist}(X)}{ eg \\\\mathrm{Pacifist}(X)}, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Quaker}(X):\\\\mathrm{Pacifist}(X)}{\\\\mathrm{Pacifist}(X)} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{Republican}(\\\\mathrm{Nixon}), \\\\mathrm{Quaker}(\\\\mathrm{Nixon})\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\rangle Since Nixon is both a Republican and a Quaker, both defaults can be applied. However, applying the first default leads to the conclusion that Nixon is not a pacifist, which makes the second default not applicable. In the same way, applying the second default we obtain that Nixon is a pacifist, thus making the first default not applicable. This particular default theory has therefore two extensions, one in which is true, and one in which is false. The original semantics of default logic was based on the fixed point of a function. The following is an equivalent algorithmic definition. If a default contains formulae with free variables, it is considered to represent the set of all defaults obtained by giving a value to all these variables. A default \\\\frac{\\\\alpha:\\\\beta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\beta_n}{\\\\gamma} is applicable to a propositional theory if T \\\\models \\\\alpha and all theories T \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\\\\\} are consistent. The application of this default to leads to the theory T \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}. An extension can be generated by applying the following algorithm: T=W /* current theory */ A=0 /* set of defaults applied so far */ /* apply a sequence of defaults */ while there is a default d that is not in A and is applicable to T add the consequence of d to T add d to A /* final consistency check */ if for every default d in A T is consistent with all justifications of d then output T This algorithm is non-deterministic, as several defaults can alternatively be applied to a given theory . In the Nixon diamond example, the application of the first default leads to a theory to which the second default cannot be applied and vice versa. As a result, two extensions are generated: one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which Nixon is not a pacifist. The final check of consistency of the justifications of all defaults that have been applied implies that some theories do not have any extensions. In particular, this happens whenever this check fails for every possible sequence of applicable defaults. The following default theory has no extension: : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{:A(b)}{ eg A(b)} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\emptyset \\\\right\\\\rangle Since A(b) is consistent with the background theory, the default can be applied, thus leading to the conclusion that A(b) is false. This result however undermines the assumption that has been made for applying the first default. Consequently, this theory has no extensions. In a normal default theory, all defaults are normal: each default has the form \\\\frac{\\\\phi : \\\\psi}{\\\\psi}. A normal default theory is guaranteed to have at least one extension. Furthermore, the extensions of a normal default theory are mutually inconsistent, i.e., inconsistent with each other. =Entailment= A default theory can have zero, one, or more extensions. Entailment of a formula from a default theory can be defined in two ways: ; Skeptical : a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by all its extensions; ; Credulous : a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by at least one of its extensions. Thus, the Nixon diamond example theory has two extensions, one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which he is not a pacifist. Consequently, neither nor are skeptically entailed, while both of them are credulously entailed. As this example shows, the credulous consequences of a default theory may be inconsistent with each other. =Alternative default inference rules= The following alternative inference rules for default logic are all based on the same syntax as the original system. ; Justified: differs from the original one in that a default is not applied if thereby the set becomes inconsistent with a justification of an applied default; ; Concise: a default is applied only if its consequence is not already entailed by (the exact definition is more complicated than this one; this is only the main idea behind it); ; Constrained: a default is applied only if the set composed of the background theory, the justifications of all applied defaults, and the consequences of all applied defaults (including this one) is consistent; ; Rational: similar to constrained default logic, but the consequence of the default to add is not considered in the consistency check; ; Cautious: defaults that can be applied but are conflicting with each other (like the ones of the Nixon diamond example) are not applied. The justified and constrained versions of the inference rule assign at least an extension to every default theory. Variants of default logic The following variants of default logic differ from the original one on both syntax and semantics. ; Assertional variants : An assertion is a pair \\\\langle p: \\\\\\\\{r_1,\\\\ldots,r_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\rangle composed of a formula and a set of formulae. Such a pair indicates that is true while the formulae r_1,\\\\ldots,r_n have been assumed consistent to prove that is true. An assertional default theory is composed of an assertional theory (a set of assertional formulae) called the background theory and a set of defaults defined as in the original syntax. Whenever a default is applied to an assertional theory, the pair composed of its consequence and its set of justifications is added to the theory. The following semantics use assertional theories: *Cumulative default logic *Commitment to assumptions default logic *Quasi-default logic ; Weak extensions : rather than checking whether the preconditions are valid in the theory composed of the background theory and the consequences of the applied defaults, the preconditions are checked for validity in the extension that will be generated; in other words, the algorithm for generating extensions starts by guessing a theory and using it in place of the background theory; what results from the process of extension generation is actually an extension only if it is equivalent to the theory guessed at the beginning. This variant of default logic is related in principle to autoepistemic logic, where a theory \\\\Box x \\\\rightarrow x has the model in which is true just because, assuming \\\\Box x true, the formula \\\\Box x \\\\rightarrow x supports the initial assumption. ; Disjunctive default logic : the consequence of a default is a set of formulae instead of a single formula. Whenever the default is applied, at least one of its consequences is nondeterministically chosen and made true. ; Priorities on defaults : the relative priority of defaults can be explicitly specified; among the defaults that are applicable to a theory, only one of the most preferred ones can be applied. Some semantics of default logic do not require priorities to be explicitly specified; rather, more specific defaults (those that are applicable in fewer cases) are preferred over less specific ones. ; Statistical variant : a statistical default is a default with an attached upper bound on its frequency of error; in other words, the default is assumed to be an incorrect inference rule in at most that fraction of times it is applied. Translations Default theories can be translated into theories in other logics and vice versa. The following conditions on translations have been considered: ; Consequence-Preserving : the original and the translated theories have the same (propositional) consequences; ; Faithful : this condition only makes sense when translating between two variants of default logic or between default logic and a logic in which a concept similar to extension exists, e.g., models in modal logic; a translation is faithful if there exists a mapping (typically, a bijection) between the extensions (or models) of the original and translated theories; ; Modular : a translation from default logic to another logic is modular if the defaults and the background theory can be translated separately; moreover, the addition of formulae to the background theory only leads to adding the new formulae to the result of the translation; ; Same-Alphabet : the original and translated theories are built on the same alphabet; ; Polynomial : the running time of the translation or the size of the generated theory are required to be polynomial in the size of the original theory. Translations are typically required to be faithful or at least consequence-preserving, while the conditions of modularity and same alphabet are sometimes ignored. The translatability between propositional default logic and the following logics have been studied: * classical propositional logic; * autoepistemic logic; * propositional default logic restricted to seminormal theories; * alternative semantics of default logic; * circumscription. Translations exist or not depending on which conditions are imposed. Translations from propositional default logic to classical propositional logic cannot always generate a polynomially sized propositional theory, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Translations to autoepistemic logic exist or not depending on whether modularity or the use of the same alphabet is required. Complexity The computational complexity of the following problems about default logic is known: ; Existence of extensions : deciding whether a propositional default theory has at least one extension is \\\\Sigma^P_2-complete; ; Skeptical entailment : deciding whether a propositional default theory skeptically entails a propositional formula is \\\\Pi^P_2-complete; ; Credulous entailment : deciding whether a propositional default theory credulously entails a propositional formula is \\\\Sigma^P_2-complete; ; Extension checking : deciding whether a propositional formula is equivalent to an extension of a propositional default theory is \\\\Delta^{P[\\\\log]}_2-complete; ; Model checking : deciding whether a propositional interpretation is a model of an extension of a propositional default theory is \\\\Sigma^P_2-complete.

She is one of the top skaters of her era, and one of the most decorated athletes in Olympic history. Blair competed for the United States in four Olympics, winning five gold medals and one bronze medal. Blair made her Olympic debut in Sarajevo in 1984 where she finished eighth in the 500 meters. At the time, Blair trained in both short-track and long-track speed skating. She won the 1986 short-track world championship. Blair returned to the Olympics in 1988 competing in long-track at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. There she won her first Olympic gold medal in the 500 meters and a bronze medal in the 1,000 meter. Blair won two gold medals in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and her final two Olympic gold medals at the 1994 Lillehammer games. Blair continued competing through 1995 when the World Championships were held in Milwaukee, finally retiring in March 1995. After retiring from speed skating, Blair became a motivational speaker. She has been inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. Early life and education Blair was born in Cornwall, New York to Charlie and Eleanor Blair. She was the youngest of six children. Her godmother is Canadian speed skater Cathy Priestner. The family moved to Champaign, Illinois when Bonnie was a toddler. Already a hobby for her siblings, Bonnie first tried skating at age two. She participated in her first skating meet at age 4. Early on, Blair competed in \\"pack style,\\" or short track speed skating, where several skaters race on the ice at once. At age 7, Blair won her age group at the Illinois Speed Skating Championship. She attended Jefferson Middle School and later Centennial High School in Champaign In addition to skating, Blair was also a cheer leader and a member of the student council. It wasn't until 1979 when Olympic medalist Cathy Priestner Faminow became Blair's coach that Blair switched from pack style to long track speed skating in which skaters compete for the fastest time. At age 15, Blair tried out for the national team, earning a spot on her first attempt. With her increased focus on the 1984 Olympics, Blair went to train in Europe. To finance the expense of training in Europe, the Champaign Policemen's Benevolent Association began sponsoring some of Blair. She completed her high school diploma through the mail in 1982. She moved to the Milwaukee area to train with the United States national speed skating team, living with a family friend while she trained. Blair took classes at Parkland College, although college classes were less of a priority than training and she did not receive a degree. Career = Early career and first Olympics (1984–1986) = Blair made her international competitive debut at the 1984 World Sprinting Championships where she placed tenth. Later that year, Blair appeared at her first Olympic games at age 19 in Sarajevo. Blair had not been not considered a front-runner and later recalled she was happy just to be at the games and see her family in the stands. She failed to medal and finished eighth in the 500 meters. The U.S. failed to win any speed skating medals at the 1984 Olympics. After the 1984 Olympics, Blair worked closely with coach Mike Crowe to improve her skating skills to compete with the powerful East German skaters. A strong performance at the United States International Skating Association Metric All-Around Championships, held in West Allis, Wisconsin, earned Blair a spot on the U.S. long track women's sprint team for the 1985 World Championships. Blair won both the 500 meter and 1500 meter at the West Allis event, and was considered one of the U.S. team's strongest medal contenders. On the 1985-1986 World Cup Circuit, Blair finished fourth in four distances: the 500 meter, 1,000 meter, and 1,500 meter. In May 1985, at a time when U.S. speed skating lacked unity, U.S. International Speedskating Association replaced national team coach Dianne Holum with Mike Crowe. During this time, Blair trained in both short-track and long-track. Blair won events at 1984, 1985 and 1986 short-track world championships and was the 1986 overall short-track world champion. = Rise and becoming an Olympic medalist (1987–1989) = Early in 1987, Blair won World Cup titles in the 500 and 1,000 meters. She followed up her World Cup titles in by setting her first world record in the 500 meters with a time 39.43 seconds. Blair also proved she could beat East-German world champion Karin Enke-Kania in head to head match-ups. Although Blair was four inches shorter than Enke-Kania, Blair's technique and fast start time made her a formidable competitor. Blair held a world record at 500 meters until December 1987 when Christa Rothenburger beat her time at the World Cup. Blair, under the weather with a cough and cold, finished second in the event. Overall, Blair won 4 of 18 women's medals at the 1987 World Cup; East German skaters, including Rothenburger, won 13. At the December 1987 U.S. speed skating trials for the 1988 Winter Olympics, Blair led the women's field in the 500,1,000, and 1,500 meters, securing her place on the U.S. Olympic team, as expected. Blair was considered a stronger competitor in the shorter distances, where she was seen as the United States' best chance at a gold medal in speed skating. U.S. speed skating failure to win a single medal at the 1984 Olympics added to the pressure and attention focused on Blair leading up to the 1988 games. Blair went on to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, where her first event was the 500 meters. Rothenburger skating first, setting a new world record. Blair responded to the challenge with her best start ever in the 500 meters, winning the gold medal in world record time of 39.10 seconds. For her second event of the games, Blair had a personal best and briefly set an Olympic record in the 1,000 meters. Two of Blair's competitors, who skated after her, subsequently beat her time; thus Blair won the bronze in the 1,000 meters. Blair's third and final event of the 1988 Winter Olympics was the 1,500 meters, in which she placed fourth. Blair's family friends in the stands, affectionately known as the \\"Blair Bunch,\\" became a staple of her competitive career. To end the games, Blair was chosen to carry the American flag at the closing ceremonies. Despite her success at the 1988 Olympics, Blair did not enjoy a windfall from endorsements. Holding Blair back from more advertisements was both her choice of sports, which was thought to be less marketable, and ABC's coverage of the games, which failed to resonate with viewers. Blair also took a break from skating, enrolling in Montana Technological University. She skipped the first two World Cup events of the 1989 season. Blair was back to competing later in the season and won the 1989 World Sprint Championships held in Heerenveen, Netherlands. At the event, Blair won the 500 meters twice and finished third and second in two 100 meters races for an overall victory. The win made Blair the first U.S. woman to win a world sprint championship in nearly a decade. Following the 1988 Olympics, Blair also tried track cycle racing, and was coached by former speed skater and cycling world champion Connie Paraskevin. Cycling became part of Blair's speed skating training as both sports utilized the same muscle groups. She made her competitive cycling debut in June 1989 at the Sundance Juice Sparkler Grand Prix. After placing fourth at U.S. Nationals and missing the opportunity to compete at the World Championships, Blair opted to give up competitive cycling and focus solely on speed skating. = Repeat Olympic gold (1990–1992) = The 1990-1991 season had setbacks for Blair. She contracted a severe case of bronchitis that affected her breaching. The breathing problem lingered through the 1991 World Sprint Championships where she finished fifth. Confidence in coach Crowe had waned in the lead up to the 1988 Olympics, Blair helped to recruit Peter Mueller to coach the U.S. team. The coaching switch took place ten months before the 1992 Olympics. Training with Mueller in the summer before the Olympics, Blair regained her competitive edge. Blair again competed at Olympics in 1992, this time held in Albertville, France. Although she had won gold at the prior Olympics, Blair felt that her small stature made her an underdog against much larger East German competitors. Blair again won gold in the 500 meters, becoming the first woman to win the event in back to back Olympics, with a time of 40.33 seconds. Her winning time was slower than her record setting pace in Calgary, however, the venue in Albertville was outdoors creating conditions which were less conducive for speed skating. The second-place finisher, Ye Qiaobo of China, claimed to have been slowed down by an improper crossover from another skater. Although Ye claimed the crossover cost her the gold, the referee's rejected China's protest. Blair dedicated her gold medal to her father, Charlie, who had died from lung cancer two years earlier. Charlie had dreamed of Bonnie becoming an Olympic speed skater. In her second event, the 1,500 meters, Blair finished 21st. The placement was due in part to the strategy of her coach, Peter Mueller; Mueller told Blair he would give her a signal to coast if he felt she was not on pace for a podium finish, allowing her to conserve energy. As Blair approached the final 400 meters, Mueller gave the signal. Blair won her second gold of the 1992 Olympics in the 1,000 meters (1:21.90). Her time was only 0.02 seconds faster than Ye. Blair's gold made her the most decorated U.S. woman in Winter Olympics of all time. Her success in the 1992 Olympics led to more attention for Blair. She was on the cover of Sports Illustrated.' Blair also began to pick-up more endorsements, including sports marketing group Advantage International. After the Olympics, Blair moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to train at the newly opened Pettit International Ice Center. = Final Olympics (1993–1994) = Back in 1986, the International Olympic Committee voted to stage the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics in alternating four year cycles. Thus, the next Winter Games would be held in February 1994. The attempt to compete at her fourth Olympics was not without its challenges; the 1993 season was lackluster for Blair. At the 1993 World Sprint Championships, Blair did not win any of her four races finishing behind rival Ye Qiabo. Blair felt as though she had lost her quickness and after failing to rectify the problem with coach Peter Mueller, she switched to Nick Thometz. At the 1994, U.S. Olympic long-track trials at the Pettit National Ice Center, Blair set track records in the first round of the 500 meter and 1,000 meter trails. The 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, were another success for Blair: She again won gold in the 500 meters (39.25) and 1,000 meters (1:18.74) races. Blair finished 0.36 seconds ahead of the second best time in the 500 meters. Her 1.38 second margin in the 1,000 meters race is the largest margin of victory in the history of the event. Blair's success at Lillehammer placed her among the most decorate American Olympians of all time. She became the first American woman to win five gold Olympic medals and the first American Winter Olympian to win six career medals. In addition to the 500 and 1,000 meters races, Blair also competing in the 1,500 meter distance missing the podium with a fourth place finish. At her post race press conference, Blair confirmed Lillehammer would be her last Olympic games. =Post-Olympic career= After the 1994 Olympics, Blair continued to compete. Less than a month after Lillehammer Olympics, Blair set another world record in the 500 meters, becoming the first female to complete the race in under 39 seconds, achieving a time of 38.99 seconds. Blair topped her own World Record the following year, achieving a time of 38.69 on February 12, 1995 in Calgary.

Clausulae eventually became used as substitutes for passages of original plainchant. They occur as melismatic figures based on a single word or syllable within an organum (a composition where one or more voices have been added to a plainchant melody to create polyphony). The text of a clausula differs from that of the plainchant melody underneath it. Each clausula is clearly delineated by a final cadence. Clausulae emerged from the compositional practices of the Notre Dame school in Paris c. 1160–1250 (during the stylistic period known as ars antiqua), especially those of the composers Léonin and Pérotin. Rather than write entirely new music, the preference was to take existing music, that is, plainchant melodies, and develop or improve upon them. Pérotin's clausulae make use of the rhythmic modes, whose strict metrical feet necessitated that voices change notes together (discantus). This was in contrast to the earlier practice of one voice moving in a free rhythm above a \\"tenor\\" voice (Latin tenere: \\"to hold\\") sustaining the long notes of a cantus firmus. The tenor line was often repeated to allow for expansion of the clausula; this was the origin of the technique known as isorhythm. Hundreds of clausulae in two, three and four parts were incorporated into the Magnus Liber Organi of Léonin and Pérotin. Others were arranged in liturgical order within appropriate manuscripts so that they could be easily introduced into a particular organum setting or piece of plainchant. As they were notated separately, it was possible for them to be expanded and developed further, and they eventually became standalone pieces which could be sung at certain points in the liturgy. The composition of clausulae died out in the mid-13th century as they were replaced by motets as the main platform for the development of new compositional techniques. *.

After serving his sentence, he was released in 2016. Dutt's life receives considerable media coverage in India, and in 2018, Sanju, a biopic based on his life (which also saw a special appearance by him), was released to positive reviews and emerged as one of the highest-grossers of Indian cinema.

On 21 October 2010, he became a father to twins, a boy and a girl. He is a devout Shaiva Hindu who has read holy scriptures and theological works.Personal Life Material - Religious Views Source Bombay (now Mumbai) suffered a series of serial bombings in 1993. Dutt was among several people associated with Bollywood who were accused of involvement. It was alleged that Dutt accepted a delivery of weapons at his house from Abu Salem and co-accused Riyaz Siddiqui, who had also been implicated in relation to the Mumbai blasts. It was claimed that the weapons formed a part of a large consignment of arms connected to the terrorists. Dutt, however, in his confession stated that he took only one Type-56 from the producers of his movie Sanam, for his own family protection. It has also been reported that Sanjay Dutt's father Sunil Dutt's political rivalry caused Sanjay Dutt's conviction. In April 1993, he was arrested under the provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). Dutt was granted bail by the Supreme Court of India on 5 May 1993; however, on 4 July 1994 his bail was cancelled and he was re-arrested. On 16 October 1995 he was granted bail. Abdul Qayyum Abdul Karim Shaikh, who was thought to be a close aide of the terrorists' ringleader, Dawood Ibrahim, was arrested. Dutt had given Qayuum's name to the police when confessing to arms possession, saying that in September 1992 he had bought a pistol from Qayuum in Dubai. His arrest coincided with the release of his film, Khalnayak, in which he played a wanted criminal. The film's major success was in part due to Dutt's off-screen legal controversy. On 31 July 2007, Dutt was cleared of the charges relating to the Mumbai blast; however, the TADA court sentenced Dutt to six years' rigorous imprisonment under Arms act for illegal possession of weapons. According to The Guardian, \\"The actor claimed he feared for his life after the notorious 'Black Friday' bombings, which were allegedly staged by Mumbai's Muslim-dominated mafia in retaliation for deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes a few months earlier. But the judge rejected this defence and also refused bail.\\" Dutt was returned to jail at Arthur Road and soon after moved to the Yerawada Central Jail in Pune. Dutt appealed against the sentence and was granted interim bail on 20 August 2007 until such time as the TADA court provided him with a copy of its judgement. On 22 October 2007 Dutt was back in jail but again applied for bail. On 27 November 2007, Dutt was granted bail by the Supreme Court. On 21 March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the verdict but shortened the sentence to five years' imprisonment. Dutt was given a month to surrender before the authorities. Dutt has said that \\"I am not a politician but I belong to a political family.\\" He was persuaded by a close friend to contest the 2009 Lok Sabha elections as a candidate for the Samajwadi Party, but withdrew when the court refused to suspend his conviction. He was then appointed General Secretary of the Samajwadi Party, leaving that post in December 2010. In March 2013 the Supreme Court upheld Dutt's five-year sentence, 18 months of which he already spent in jail during the trial. He was given four weeks to surrender to the authorities, the court having refused to release him on probation due to the severity of the offence. On 10 May, the Supreme Court rejected Dutt's review petition for the reconsideration of his conviction and asked him to surrender on the stipulated date. on 14 May, Dutt withdrew the mercy plea and surrendered to the Mumbai Police on 16 May 2013. Just before the surrender, the Mumbai jail authority got an anonymous letter threatening Dutt's life. Dutt filed an appeal to allow him to surrender before entering Yerwada Central Jail. Later, Dutt withdrew this request too. He was paroled from 21 December 2013. The parole was extended three times until March 2014, raising concern in Bombay High Court and a proposal from the Government of Maharashtra to amend the law of parole. He returned to Yerwada Central Jail after his parole ended. Dutt was out on a two weeks' furlough granted by the Yerwada Central Jail authorities on 24 December. He was subsequently incarcerated in Yerwada Central Jail, to complete his jail term. He was released from there on 25 February 2016 after serving his sentence. =Health Issues= Sanjay Dutt was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer in August 2020.

Ouimet was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in an 1873 by-election as Member of Parliament for Laval, Quebec. He was a Liberal-Conservative and supporter of the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. After being educated in a seminary, and a brief career as a journalist, Ouimet became a lawyer. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the age of 25. His advocacy of the rights of French-Canadians was challenged by the Conservative government's attitude to Louis Riel. Following the First Riel Rebellion, Ouimet argued for Riel to be pardoned, and, in 1875, voted against a Conservative motion to expel Riel from the seat in the House of Commons to which he had been elected. With the beginning of the Second Riel Rebellion in 1885, Minister of Militia Adolphe Caron asked Ouimet to raise a regiment from Montreal to join in the suppression of the uprising. Ouimet raised three hundred men, and led his regiment as its Lieutenant-Colonel. He was put under the command of Thomas Bland Strange who rejected Ouimet's proposal to negotiate safe passage for Riel. Strange sent Ouimet to Ottawa to secure supplies resulting in newspapers accusing him of desertion. He returned west and was placed in command of Fort Edmonton. Despite fighting against the rebels, Ouimet opposed the execution of Riel when he returned to Ottawa. Ouimet's pleas fell on deaf ears, and, despite his efforts, he was condemned by French-Canadians for having helped put down the rebellion. Ouimet voted in the House of Commons for a Liberal motion to censure the government for executing Riel. The execution of Riel seriously damaged the Conservative Party in Quebec, and was one of the key factors in the party's decline and eventual loss of power. In an attempt at conciliation, Prime Minister Macdonald nominated Ouimet for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada following the 1887 election. Because of the custom of alternating between English and French Speakers following each general election, Ouimet returned to the backbench following the 1891 election. Macdonald died in June 1891, and his longtime Quebec lieutenant, Sir Hector Langevin, was forced to resign from Cabinet due to a corruption scandal in August. In January 1892, Prime Minister Sir John Abbott made Ouimet the senior minister from Quebec, and appointed him to Langevin's old job as Minister of Public Works. Ouimet stayed in that position under the succession of Prime Ministers who attempted to keep the Conservative government together. He also served as Acting Minister of Agriculture and Acting Secretary of State for Canada under Sir Mackenzie Bowell. Bowell faced a caucus revolt over his handling of the Manitoba Schools Question and was forced to resign. The issue split the party as English Protestant Conservatives rejected Bowell's proposal to create a new Catholic School Board in Manitoba. With the fall of Bowell's cabinet, the opposition of Tory MPs to French Catholic rights in Manitoba further hurt the party's prospects among Catholic Quebecers. Perhaps sensing that the Conservative government was doomed and that his prospects of keeping his seat were dim as Quebecers turned against the Tories, Ouimet decided not to run in the 1896 election. He declined to serve in the short lived Cabinet of the Sir Charles Tupper, the final Tory Prime Minister prior to the election. He instead accepted a judicial appointment that he held until his death in 1916. He holds the current record for being acclaimed to parliament 5 times. Ouimet Canyon near Thunder Bay in northwestern Ontario is named for him.

Systematically, it is only distantly related to other guineafowl genera. Its closest living relative, the white breasted guineafowl, Agelastes meleagrides inhabit primary forests in Central Africa. It is a member of the bird family Numididae, and is the only member of the genus Acryllium. It is a resident breeder in northeast Africa, from southern Ethiopia through Kenya and just into northern Tanzania. Description Upper body At Tsavo East National Park, Kenya The vulturine guineafowl is a large (61–71 cm) bird with a round body and small head. It has a longer wings, neck, legs and tail than other guineafowl. The adult has a bare blue face and black neck, and although all other guineafowl have unfeathered heads, this species looks particularly like a vulture because of the long bare neck and head. The slim neck projects from a cape of long, glossy, blue and white hackles. The breast is cobalt blue, and the rest of the body plumage is black, finely spangled with white. The wings are short and rounded, and the tail is longer than others in the family Numididae. The sexes are similar, although the female is usually slightly smaller than the male and with smaller tarsal spurs. Young birds are mainly grey-brown, with a duller blue breast and short hackles. Behaviour The vulturine guineafowl is a gregarious species, forming flocks outside the breeding season typically of about 25 birds. This species' food is seeds and small invertebrates. This guineafowl is terrestrial and will run rather than fly when alarmed. Despite the open habitat, it tends to keep to cover, and roosts in trees. It makes loud chink-chink-chink-chink- chink calls. It breeds in dry and open habitats with scattered bushes and trees, such as savannah or grassland. It usually lays 4–8 cream-coloured eggs in a well-hidden grass-lined scrape.

The Romans occasionally referred to this phenomenon with the Latin phrase \\"\\", which translates into English roughly as \\"the past is always well remembered\\". Rosy retrospection is very closely related to the concept of nostalgia. The difference between the terms is that rosy retrospection is a cognitive bias, whereas the broader phenomenon of nostalgia is not necessarily based on a biased perspective. Although rosy retrospection is a cognitive bias, and distorts a person's view of reality to some extent, some people theorize that it may in part serve a useful purpose in increasing self-esteem and a person's overall sense of well-being. For example, Terence Mitchell and Leigh Thompson mention this possibility in a chapter entitled \\"A Theory of Temporal Adjustments of the Evaluation of Events\\" in a book of collected research reports from various authors entitled \\"Advances in Managerial Cognition and Organizational Information Processing\\". Simplifications and exaggerations of memories (such as occurs in rosy retrospection) may also make it easier for people's brains to store long-term memories, as removing details may reduce the burden of those memories on the brain and make the brain require fewer neural connections to form and engrain memories. Mnemonics, psychological chunking, and subconscious distortions of memories may in part serve a similar purpose: memory compression by way of simplification. Data compression in computers works on similar principles: compression algorithms tend to either (1) remove unnecessary details from data or (2) reframe the details in a simpler way from which the data can subsequently be reconstructed as needed, or (3) both. Much the same can be said of human memories and the human brain's own process of memorization. In English, the idiom \\"rose-colored glasses\\" or \\"rose-tinted glasses\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the phenomenon of rosy retrospection. Usually this idiom occurs as some variation of the phrase \\"seeing things through rose-tinted glasses\\" or some other roughly similar phrasing. Rosy retrospection is also related to the concept of declinism. Experiments In one group of experiments, three groups going on different vacations were interviewed before, during, and after their vacations. Most followed the pattern of initially positive anticipation, followed by mild disappointment thereafter. Generally, most subjects reviewed the events more favorably some time after the events had occurred than they did while experiencing them.

Created by comedy writers Allan Sherman and Howard Merrill, it was a derivative of Goodson-Todman's own panel show, What's My Line? Instead of celebrity panelists trying to determine a contestant's occupation, as in What's My Line, the panel tried to determine a contestant's \\"secret\\": something that is unusual, amazing, embarrassing, or humorous about that person. The original version of I've Got a Secret premiered on CBS on June 19, 1952, and ran until April 3, 1967. The show began broadcasting in black and white and switched to color in 1966, when all commercial prime time network programs in the US began to be produced in color. The show was revived for the 1972–73 season in once-a-week syndication and again from June 15 to July 6, 1976, as a summer replacement series on CBS. Oxygen launched a daily revival series in 2000, which ran until 2001. A second revival by GSN premiered on April 17, 2006, and aired new episodes daily until June 9, 2006.

After several months of an ever-changing panel, game show host Bill Cullen, acerbic comedian Henry Morgan, TV hostess Faye Emerson, and actress Jayne Meadows became the four regular panelists. In 1958, Emerson left the show to star in a play and was replaced by an actress Betsy Palmer. Later that year, Meadows relocated to the West Coast and was replaced by former Miss America Bess Myerson. At various times, guest hosts substituted for Moore, including panelists Cullen, Morgan and Palmer, among others. Additionally, other comedians and celebrities appeared as guests on the panel when others were away. The announcer for most of the 1952–67 run was John Cannon. Moore left the show after the 1963–64 season. After his comedy program The Garry Moore Show was canceled, Moore chose to retire from television to travel the world with his wife.Moore, Garry.

Allen also hosted the show during the 1972−73 revival. Former panelist Bill Cullen hosted the show for its brief 1976 CBS summer run. Frequent panelists on this revival were Richard Dawson, Henry Morgan, Pat Carroll, and Elaine Joyce. The version seen on Oxygen was hosted by Stephanie Miller until August 2001. Regular panelists on this version included Jim J. Bullock, Jason Kravits, Amy Yasbeck, and Teri Garr. The GSN version was hosted by Bil Dwyer and, unlike the earlier versions, featured a permanent panel that appeared on each episode, consisting of Billy Bean, Frank DeCaro, Jermaine Taylor, and Suzanne Westenhoefer. Original series =Game play= Each typical episode featured two regular contestant rounds, followed by a celebrity guest round, occasionally followed by an additional regular round. Standard rounds Each round was a guessing game in which the panel tried to determine a contestant's \\"secret\\". The concept of a \\"secret\\" was fairly broad. Secrets were always intended to be unusual, amazing, embarrassing, or humorous. They commonly included something that happened to the contestant, something owned by the contestant, or a notable occupation, hobby, achievement, or skill. Each show began with the entrance of one or more contestants. The host then introduced the contestant or asked his or her name and hometown. He then ask them to \\"whisper your secret to me, and we'll show it to the folks at home.\\" The contestant then ostensibly whispered the secret, while the audience and viewers were shown the secret as a text overlay on the screen. Then the host gave the panel a clue -- for example, \\"the secret concerns something that happened to [contestant's name].\\" The host then selected a panelist to begin questioning. When the show debuted, each panelist had 15 seconds of questioning at a time, running through the panel twice, in order. Each segment of questioning which passed without the panelist guessing the secret won the contestant $10, for a top prize of $80. In mid-1954, the format changed to only once around the panel, with a $20 prize for each panelist stumped. The time limit was no longer fixed, and the buzzer which ended questioning was instead at the discretion of the production staff. This was due, in part, to the program airing live, and sometimes requiring to lengthen or shorten the time allowed for questioning in order to keep the show running on time. Increasingly later in the run, the panelists were sometimes buzzed out when they were getting too close to the secret, were suspected to be about to get it, or simply at a point that would get a laugh; this was precipitated in part by the fact that, like What's My Line?, the top payoff never increased with inflation, and the money eventually became somewhat secondary to the gameplay, with the cash awards not even mentioned at all by the end of the series. Similarly, the panelist chosen to question first eventually became a strategy by the producers. When a secret fell within an area that a panelist was knowledgeable on (most commonly Cullen with mechanical, scientific or sports secrets), they would often be chosen first, to give them no preceding clues during their questioning. On occasion when a secret referenced a panelist, the order was usually chosen to put them last. Following the revelation of a guest's secret, either by guessing or by the host's revelation once the game was over, the host typically either interviewed the contestant about their secret, or, if applicable, the contestant did some kind of demonstration of their secret. These demonstrations sometimes included the host, and occasionally one or more of the panelists. Beyond the standard celebrity guests, several notable people with secrets appeared, including Colonel Harland Sanders (\\"I started my restaurant with my first Social Security check\\"), drummer Pete Best (\\"I used to be one of The Beatles\\"), and a 95-year-old man, Samuel J. Seymour, who was the last surviving eyewitness to Abraham Lincoln's assassination (he was five years old at the time). In 1958, an episode devoted to the theme of \\"teenage appreciation\\" was the show's answer to media reports of teenage delinquency, and featured nine teenagers of unusual accomplishment including the then 15-year-old chess champion Bobby Fischer, 16-year-old pop star Paul Anka, and 19-year-old college basketball star Oscar Robertson. Sgt. Ira Jones, who served as Elvis Presley's First Sergeant in Germany, made an appearance. Scientist Philo T. Farnsworth, the inventor of electronic television, made his only televised appearance as a contestant on the show. Guest rounds Celebrity guest Hermione Gingold with host Garry Moore. On each typical episode, a celebrity guest came on the show with a secret. The celebrity usually opened the episode by coming out from the behind the curtain and saying \\"my name is [Name] and I've Got a Secret!\\", though sometimes they would say \\"and this is I've Got a Secret!\\". Early in the show's run, the celebrities would indeed have actual personal secrets similar to the other contestants. However, producer Allan Sherman later admitted that these celebrity \\"secrets\\" (such as Boris Karloff being afraid of mice) were frequently concocted by the show's staff, and the celebrities merely played along. The celebrity \\"secret\\" was slowly phased out during the mid-1950s, as an increasingly common activity for the celebrity guest was to challenge the panel in some sort of alternate game. Eventually, this became the primary use of the guest segment, and the pretense of having the panel guess the guest's secret was dropped altogether. The guest would simply come out with a challenge for the panel; sometimes ostensibly related to the guest or their current project, but other times not related to the guest at all. Several of these challenges predated future game shows which used the same concepts, such as a game in which Woody Allen challenged the panel to guess words based on definitions written by children, which became the basis for Child's Play, and a pair of segments with Peter Falk and Soupy Sales in which the panel had to identify celebrities based on a series of photos starting with infancy and progressing older. which featured in the format of the show Face the Music. Often, secrets would involve Henry Morgan in some manner. Since Morgan put forth a 'lovable sourpuss' type of attitude, he attracted a certain \\"let's see how we can 'get' Henry this time\\" playfulness from the writers. Sometimes he would be sent on week-long trips (often starting as soon as the live broadcast ended) which would be filmed and highlights shown the following week. Some of these trips included being sent to England to buy a proper English Christmas meal from a famous English restaurant while dressed in a stereotypical English derby and morning coat outfit, spending a week at Roy Rogers' dude ranch as a hired hand, and going on an African safari (after the secret was revealed Morgan got his passport photo taken and shots given to him by a nurse on stage as Moore told him about his trip). Other Henry secrets included him being invited to be a background spear holder in an opera at the Met, him playing the dead body in a murder mystery Broadway play, a Christmas episode in which Morgan is dressed up to play Santa for disadvantaged kids, and a Halloween episode in which Arnold Stang came on stage in a traditional bedsheet ghost costume with the secret \\"This costume was made from Henry Morgan's bedsheet\\". After the game Moore said \\"Don't worry Henry, we promise to put these back where we found them\\", at which point the center stage curtain rose to reveal (what is assumed to be) Morgan's bed. =History and style= I've Got a Secret was more informal than sister show What's My Line? in most respects. The panel and host were generally on a first-name basis. As noted, the formal time limit on questioning was removed early in the show's run, and time limits were set more for entertainment. The men on the panel always wore normal suits or even sport jackets, though both Morgan and Moore sometimes chose bow ties over straight ties. Until the later years of the series, both Moore and members of the panel smoked cigarettes on the air, with Moore doing so right up until his last episode. The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host, usually with a series of descriptive puns. Only yes-or-no questions were supposed to be asked by the panel, but the format was often relaxed, and other questions slipped through. Unlike on What's My Line?, the host often offered hints and suggestions when the panel was off in the wrong direction, or when an answer might be misleading. Unlike on What's My Line?, the panelists were not allowed to formally confer with each other, though later in the series, there was no chastising of the panelists for whispering ideas to each other. The series began in black-and-white, and only in 1966 switched regularly to color, though like most programs of this era, existing records are in black and white. The series was sponsored for most of its run, with the opening of the show featuring a promotion for whichever company was the sponsor, signage on the set, and commercials being included during the show. Some sponsors provided samples of their wares for each contestant, in addition to their winnings. Late in the series' run, sponsorship was discontinued. I've Got a Secret was, along with What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth, canceled in a mass axing of CBS's remaining panel shows in 1967; the shows were still financially successful but were not drawing good ratings, especially among the key demographics. Of the three, I've Got a Secret was the only one not to continue uninterrupted in some other form. (What's My Line? moved to syndication, and To Tell the Truth continued as a daytime series.) Then-host Steve Allen would return to his syndicated talk show the next year. The series itself had a cameo in the 1959 film It Happened to Jane, in which the title character appears as a contestant on the show. Moore and the entire panel played themselves in the fictional episode of the show. In 1992, Carsey-Werner attempted to revive the show for the Fall of 1993 and quite possibly pair it up with the Bill Cosby revival of You Bet Your Life in syndication.http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-13/entertainment/ca-1436_1_cosby_show \\"Secret\\" Comeback: I've Got a Secret However, plans for it fell through at the last minute. Thus, it never made it to air. Also, this was the only version of the show never to have announced a permanent host or its four panelists for the show at all. =Merchandise= A home game of I've Got a Secret, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box, was released in 1956 by the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City. =Foreign Versions= An Australian version of the show was produced and aired in Brisbane on QTQ Channel 9 from 1967 to 1973. It was hosted by newsreader Don Secombe, and like its American inspiration, featured regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee, Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers (future wife of Australian game show impresario Reg Grundy) . A different Australian version aired in Melbourne in 1956, with Eric Pearce as host. It debuted during the first week of television programming in that city and opening night for television station HSV 7 (November 4) with American actress, Jean Moorhead, as a guest panellist. During its run, it featured regular panelists such as Olive Wykes, Shirley Cecil, John Frith, Freddie Bowler and Jack Dyer. It is not clear when that particular version ended, but it was still running in 1958. It is not known if any kinescopes exist of this version. A Japanese version aired on NHK from 1956 to 1967 called My Secret, hosted by Keizo Takahashi. French network TF1 aired J'ai un Secret between 1982 and 1983, hosted by Pierre Bellemare. Two versions were produced in the United Kingdom. The first was produced by Associated-Rediffusion and aired on ITV in 1956. This version was hosted by American-born Ben Lyon. The second version aired on BBC1 from 1984 to 1988, hosted by Tom O'Connor. Changes in the revivals =1970s revivals= The large logo on the IGAS set in 1972. The neon logo used on the 1976 revival of IGAS. The format of the 1970s revivals were essentially unchanged from the original series, though celebrity secrets, rather than challenges to the panel (whose members changed weekly), did return. Richard Dawson served as a regular panelist on both versions in the 1970s, with actress Pat Carroll also making frequent panel appearances, and Henry Morgan appeared as a panelist a few times as well. =Oxygen revival= On the Oxygen revival, panelists had 45 seconds each for the questioning. The contestant earned $250 for each stumped panelist, and stumping the entire panel earned a total of $1,000 for the challenger. Stephanie Miller hosted this version and the show's set resembled an upscale city apartment. =GSN revival= On GSN's revival, each panelist had 40 seconds for questioning, with one conference allowed. Stumping the entire panel won the contestant $1,000 and dinner for two in Beverly Hills. The disclaimer at the end of the program disclosed that contestants were also paid an appearance fee. Losing contestants also received some unspecified parting gifts. Several minor show business professionals demonstrated their performances on the show, including piano juggler Dan Menendez. Another element in the revival was that all the panelists were openly gay, but their \\"secret\\" was generally only referenced in double entendres, such as when host Bil Dwyer was introduced as \\"the straight man to the panel\\". Episode status As with What's My Line?, early episodes from the original series' first season in 1952 appear to have been lost. From late 1952 until the 1967 cancellation, most episodes appear to exist as a digital transfer of the original black-and-white kinescope films. However, the premiere episode, which featured a drastically different set-up, is presumed to be lost. =GSN= A good portion of the series is unlikely to be aired, due to the show's longtime sponsorship by Winston cigarettes, which remains an existing brand, and that cigarette commercials have been banned since January 1971. In fact, the prize on the 1956 episode about the 96-year-old man who was at Ford's Theater when Abraham Lincoln was shot included $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes. The man did not smoke cigarettes, so he was given Prince Albert pipe tobacco. It is unclear whether this is mandated legally, or simply a choice by GSN; GSN had aired many Winston-sponsored episodes in previous years. In addition, the network skipped several episodes through its run which are known to have been skipped in previous runs of the show; this may mean that other episodes are lost or in bad enough condition for GSN not to air them. All subsequent revivals of Secret exist in their entirety, except for the 1976 run, whose status is currently unknown, though the pilot episode (that also aired as the premiere) for that version is currently available for viewing on YouTube. The finale is also available in audio. GSN has occasionally aired single episodes from the 1972–73 season. =BUZZR= The over-the-air digital channel BUZZR, owned by Fremantle, also runs the program in a two-hour block, with To Tell the Truth and What's My Line?. Each episode airs uncut, including the original commercials (without the cigarette ones), in a 40-minute slot. Nielsen ratings Between 1952 and 1967, I've Got a Secret ranked among the top 30 television shows for ten out of fifteen seasons,     peaking at #5 during the 1957–58 season. Theme music The first theme used on the show from 1952 to 1961 was \\"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\\", by Leroy Anderson (this theme can be heard on the album Classic TV Game Show Themes; however, the theme on the CD was credited to Norman Paris). The second theme, used from 1961 to 1962, was an upbeat arrangement of the \\"Theme from A Summer Place\\", by Max Steiner. The third theme was used from 1962 to 1967. It was an upbeat, spritely march featuring piccolo and xylophone, composed by the show's musical director Norman Paris and played by a live studio combo. It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts, to which the words \\"I've got a secret!\\" might be sung by children in a teasing manner. In addition to being used as a tag for his entrance on CBS episodes he hosted, Steve Allen's composition \\"This Could Be the Start of Something\\" was used as the opening theme in 1972 arranged by Edd Kalehoff for Score Productions. The closing theme to the 1972 version was also written by Kalehoff. Tim Mosher and Stoker are credited with the 2000 theme, while Alan Ett and Scott Liggett contributed an up jazz theme for Bil Dwyer's 2006 version of the show for GSN.

The Veterans Administration Hospital is shown in the background. Route 87 in background, looking north from Loma, Montana. U.S. Highway 87 (US 87) is a north-south United States highway (though it is signed east-west in New Mexico) that runs for 1,998 miles (3,215 km) from northern Montana to southern Texas. Most of the portion from Billings, Montana, to Raton, New Mexico, is co-signed along Interstates 90 and 25. It is also co-signed along the majority of Interstate 27 in Texas. As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus is in Havre, Montana, at U.S. Highway 2. Its southern terminus is in Port Lavaca, Texas. Route description =Texas= In Texas, US 87 is a north-south highway that begins near the Gulf Coast in Port Lavaca, Texas and heads north through San Antonio, Lubbock, Amarillo, and Dalhart to the New Mexico border near Texline. =New Mexico= US 87 continues in a northwesterly direction in New Mexico, and is signed by NMDOT primarily as an east–west route. It merges with US 64 (and thus the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway) in Clayton, shortly after entering New Mexico. It continues to the northwest until Des Moines, when it takes a more westerly approach to Raton. In Raton, it separates from US 64 and merges with Interstate 25 and US-85, with which it remains concurrent through Raton Pass and into Colorado, though it is unsigned on much of the concurrency. =Colorado= US 87 remains concurrent with Interstate 25 throughout the state of Colorado, which is a rare occurrence for a US highway to have a concurrency with an Interstate in its entirety within state boundaries. For more on this section of US 87, see Interstate 25 in Colorado. =Wyoming= US 87 remains concurrent with Interstate 25 northward until exit 160 east of Glenrock where it joins US Route 20/US Route 26 from Glenrock to Casper. In Casper it splits from US-20/26 and rejoins I-25 at exit 186. It then remains concurrent with Interstate 25 northward until its terminus with Interstate 90. It then follows I-90 west to exit 44 where it runs up to Sheridan. A portion of US-87 has been washed out for several years along this stretch and \\"temporary\\" detour signs are posted directing US-87 traffic along Wyoming Highway 193 through Story. In Sheridan US-87 rejoins Interstate 90 into Montana. =Montana= US 87 remains concurrent with Interstate 90 westward until Billings, where it breaks off and heads north. Between Crow Agency and Billings, US 87 and I-90 are merged with US 212. It intersects with (and briefly merges with) US 12 in Roundup and continues north with a slight bend to the northwest until, at Grass Range it takes a sharp turn to the west at an intersection with Montana State Highway 200. US 87 remains concurrent with Montana State Highway 200 until Great Falls. In Lewistown, it merges with US 191 and remains heading generally west. Some ten miles (16 km) out of Lewistown, it breaks with US 191 and merges with Montana State Highway 3, heading generally northwest and merging briefly with US 89 before breaking with all three in Great Falls. US 87 heads northeast then east to Fort Benton and then generally northeast to its terminus with US 2 about two miles (3 km) west of Havre. Great Falls Bypass A bypass of US 87 exists on the eastern and northern edge of Great Falls. The route begins at US 87/89 west of Malmstrom Air Force Base along 57th Street South and runs south to north. Just south of the intersection with Second Avenue North the name of the road changes to 57th Street North. At 10th Avenue North, the street name changes to River Drive North, then curves towards the west as it crosses a bridge over a former Milwaukee Road railroad line. The route heads straight west until after the intersection of North Park Trail where it curves to the northwest. After a railroad crossing and the entrance to Giant Springs State Park and the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, the road curves to the southwest, generally following the south bank of the Missouri River. US 87 Bypass ends at US 87 south of the 15th Street Bridge, but River Drive North continues along the Missouri River through Riverside Park. History US Route 87 originally ran northwest out of Great Falls, Montana towards the eastern border of Glacier National Park. US 87 ran to the Canadian Border at the Piegan Border Crossing. This was changed in 1934, when US Route 89 was diverted to US 87's routing to Glacier Park. US 87 ended in Great Falls until circa 1945 when it was extended to its current northern terminus in Havre, Montana U.S. Route 185 was formed in 1926, and extended from US 85 in Cheyenne north to Orin. It became part of a southern extension and realignment of US 87 in 1936. Major intersections ;Texas : in Port Lavaca : in Victoria : in Victoria : in Cuero.

Launched in Vancouver in 1975 by the West Coast Feminist Literary Magazine Society, or the Growing Room Collective, the journal has published an estimated 3,000 women, serving as an important launching pad for emerging writers. Room publishes short fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry, art, feature interviews, and features that promote dialogue between readers, writers and the collective, including \\"Roommate\\" (a profile of a Room reader or collective member) and \\"The Back Room\\" (back page interviews on feminist topics of interest). Collective members are regular participants in literary and arts festivals in Greater Vancouver and Toronto. History The journal's original title (1975-2006) Room of One's Own came from Virginia Woolf's essay A Room of One's Own. In 2007, the collective relaunched the magazine as Room, reflecting a more outward-facing, conversational editorial mandate; however, the original name and its inspiration is reflected in a quote from the Woolf essay that always appears on the back cover of the magazine. Room magazine has always been operated by an editorial collective. Former collective members include author Gayla Reid, CBC broadcaster Eleanor Wachtel, University of British Columbia Press editor Jean Wilson, and Geist senior editor Mary Schendlinger. Works that originally appeared in Room have been anthologized the Journey Prize Anthology, Best Canadian Poetry,Tightrope Books Best Canadian Essays, and Best Canadian Stories, and have been nominated for National Magazine Awards. Approximately 90% of the content Room publishes comes from unsolicited submissions. Notable contributors Past contributors to Room include Marian Engel, Carol Shields, Eden Robinson, Nalo Hopkinson, Larissa Lai, Lorna Crozier, Evelyn Lau, Ivan Coyote, Audrey Thomas, Kate Braid, Souvankham Thammavongsa, Susan Point, Hiromi Goto, Susan Musgrave, Shani Mootoo, Elizabeth Hay, Karen Solie, Erìn Moure, Yasuko Thanh, Cynthia Flood, Gail Anderson-Dargatz, M. NourbeSe Philip, Daphne Marlatt, Bronwen Wallace, Carmen Aguirre, Ayelet Tsabari, Nancy Richler, Eliza Robertson, Carmen Rodríguez, Marie Annharte Baker, Betsy Warland, Lydia Kwa, and Elizabeth Bachinsky, among many other acclaimed writers and artists. Recent issues have included interviews with Ursula K. Le Guin, Miriam Toews, Joy Kogawa, Lisa Charleyboy, Stacey McKenzie, d'bi young, Jillian Tamaki, Janie Chang, and Mariko Tamaki. Writing contests Room currently offers four writing contests, which are open to both Canadian and international writers who identify as women or genderqueer. The deadline for the fiction and poetry contests is in mid-July, while the deadline for the creative non-fiction contest is currently on 8 March, which is also International Women's Day. The creative non-fiction contest was originally added to the other two genres in 2008, and moved to the March deadline starting in 2015. In 2016, Room launched their first Short Forms Contest, a multi-genre / genre-blending contest for flash fiction, flash CNF, and prose poetry of 500 words and under, with an inaugural deadline of January 15, 2017. In addition to offering contests, Room presents one contributor each year with a $500 Emerging Writer Award. Cover art contest In 2015, Room introduced a cover art contest with a deadline of November 30.  Making Room: Forty Years of Room Magazine  In 2017, Room published the anthology, Making Room: Forty Years of Room Magazine. The anthology contains a selection of works featured in Room between 1975 and 2016. The anthology is broken up chronologically and follows Canadian feminist writing throughout different eras of feminism. 80 pieces are featured in Making Room. The Making Room project was coordinated by Meghan Bell. = Anthology contributors = * Carmen Aguirre * Najwa Ali * Gail Anderson- Dargatz * Elizabeth Bachinsky * Marie Annharte Baker * Juliane Okot Bitek * Monique Bosco * Kate Braid * Nicole Brossard * Cyndia Cole * Ivan Coyote * Lucas Crawford * Su Croll * Lynn Crosbie * Lorna Crozier * Danielle Daniel * Amber Dawn * Junie Désil * Sandy Frances Duncan * Dorothy Elias * Christine Estima * Tanya Evanson * barbara findlay * Cynthia Flood * Chantal Gibson * Leona Gom * Jane Eaton Hamilton * Wasela Hiyate * Nancy Holmes * Anna Humphrey * Mindy Hung * Carole Itter * Amy Jones * Helen Kuk * Matea Kulić * Naoko Kumagai * Fiona Tinwei Lam * Doretta Lau * Evelyn Lau * Jen Sookfong Lee * Tracey Lindberg * Dorothy Livesay * Annabel Lyon * Vera Manuel * Daphne Marlatt * Robin Blackburn McBride * Carmelita McGrath * Cara-Lyn Morgan * Erín Moure * Susan Musgrave * Alessandra Naccarato * Kellee Ngan * Monica Pacheco * M.

A full colonel, he is a group commander at a U.S. Army Air Forces base in Pianosa and is obsessed with becoming a general. As such, he does whatever it takes to please his superiors—in particular, by repeatedly raising the number of missions the men have to fly to complete a tour of duty, beyond that normally ordered by other outfits. This becomes the bane of Yossarian's life, as every time he comes close to obtaining the target number of missions for being sent home, Colonel Cathcart raises the required number again. Cathcart himself has only flown in two missions, one of which was accidental. Feathers and black eyes Cathcart nightly makes lists of \\"feathers in his cap\\" and \\"black eyes\\", often finding something in the former category is in fact in the latter one, considering all the possible ways in which his superiors could react to them. In his attempts to please nearly everyone, Cathcart discovers that all the other soldiers hate him. This perception lives largely in his mind, but it affects his relationships with the others and they soon begin to actually dislike and/or avoid him. His paranoia, matched only by his arrogance, worsens throughout the course of the novel. Catch-22 The concept of Catch-22 is also represented in the character of Colonel Cathcart (whose name is an anagram for both \\"catch art\\" and \\"rat catch\\"), as he consists entirely of irreconcilable oppositions and maintains an illogical thought process that echoes that of the catch. Cathcart is a master of political doublespeak, often completely contradicting what he says seconds after he says it, usually when a superior officer disagrees with him. Yossarian Cathcart hates Yossarian almost as much as Yossarian hates him. When Yossarian publicly refuses to fly any more missions, Cathcart chomps at the bit to have him court martialed, but his right-hand man, Colonel Korn, talks him out of it, advising him that a dismissal from the Air Force is exactly what he wants; Cathcart instead decorates him to ensure that he will stay in the service. When Yossarian is caught AWOL in Rome, Cathcart is eager to have him court martialed and imprisoned, but Korn once again persuades him to offer him the credit for enough missions to send him home instead, to hush the whole affair up. Yossarian briefly considers the offer, but changes his mind when he hears that Orr got out of duty by escaping to Sweden. Film In Mike Nichols' 1970 film adaptation of the novel, Colonel Cathcart is portrayed by Martin Balsam. In the 2019 TV miniseries adaptation, he is portrayed by Kyle Chandler. In the Marvel comic book Truth: Red, White and Black, Isaiah Bradley is the subject of experiments at Camp Cathcart, named for the character.

Tobias (also known as Paul Edward Huge (pronounced hugh-gee); born in August 1963, Indianapolis, Indiana) is an American guitarist best known for his involvement with hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he has collaborated since 1994. Guns N' Roses The first known collaborations by Tobias and childhood friend Axl Rose can be traced back to 1984 and the formation of Hollywood Rose. The band's demo tape featured two songs co- written by Rose and Tobias; \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" and \\"Back Off Bitch\\". In 1985, Rose moved on to form Guns N' Roses. Several tracks on the band's debut album, Appetite for Destruction, were written beforehand and originally intended for earlier projects. While the Hollywood Rose track \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" was re-recorded during these sessions, it didn't make it to the album. However, it was released as a B-side of the album's first single, \\"It's So Easy/Mr. Brownstone\\". Tobias was also thanked in the album's credits. The third Guns N' Roses studio album, Use Your Illusion I, was released in 1991, featuring a re-recorded version of \\"Back Off Bitch\\". At the time, Rose stated in an interview that the song was roughly ten years old. In late 1994, Tobias replaced Gilby Clarke and played rhythm and lead guitar on the band's cover version of Rolling Stones' \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". While Tobias contributed to the song on Rose's request, his inclusion is known to have caused friction between Rose and the band's then-lead guitarist Slash, because of an overdub made by Tobias of Slash's solo on the song. Tobias is known to have worked and recorded with Guns N' Roses in 1996, when the band started working on their sixth studio album. His role in the band was not clarified publicly at the time. According to Rose, this was due to the uncertainty on whether Tobias would eventually be featured on the record and subsequent tours as a rhythm guitarist. While former band members Slash and drummer Matt Sorum have publicly stated that Tobias' involvement strengthened their respective decisions to resign from Guns N' Roses, Rose has stood by his associate. > \\"The public gets a different story from the other guys – Slash, Duff, Matt – > who have their own agendas. The original intentions between Paul and myself > were that Paul was going to help me for as long as it took to get this thing > together in whatever capacity that he could help me in. So when he first was > brought into this, he was brought in as a writer to work with Slash.\\"Press > Release: Guns N’ Roses Launch \\"Chinese Democracy\\" Tour In China. > Heretodaygonetohell.com, August 15, 2002. In 1997, Tobias began working for Guns N' Roses full-time in a studio setting, jamming and recording song ideas with, among others, the band's keyboardist Dizzy Reed and former lead guitarist Robin Finck.Dizzy Reed interview , Rock Journal, July 11, 2004 During this time Tobias and Reed wrote a song called \\"Oh My God\\".Press Release: Oh My God. Heretodaygonetohell.com, September 22, 1999. In 1999, the band recorded the song and released it on the soundtrack of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film End of Days. In January 2001, when Guns N' Roses played their first concerts in eight years at Las Vegas's House of Blues and Rock in Rio III, Rose introduced Tobias on stage in both shows as someone who had helped him in keeping the band together during the past years. In Las Vegas, Rose also noted that Tobias had previously played live in only a handful of shows. The band would play their next two concerts in December 2001, again in Las Vegas. They proved to be Tobias' last appearances as a band member. In mid-2002, due to his aversion to touring, Tobias was replaced in the band by Richard Fortus. At the time it was not officially stated that Tobias had left Guns N' Roses, although neither his name or work was mentioned for several years. When the band released Chinese Democracy in 2008 it became evident that despite his lack of touring, he had recorded several guitar and piano pieces and wrote songs for the album along with the other band members, and featured heavily on the final product. Mank Rage In 2002, Tobias' band Mank Rage (David Lank, Darren Mickler and several past drummers) expressed interest in releasing an album, consisting of material recorded prior to his tenure with Guns N' Roses.Here Today... Gone to Hell!. Heretodaygonetohell.com, September 10, 2002. In July 2006, nearly four years later, a MySpace account featuring three of the band's demos was opened. Other work Tobias worked with former Guns N' Roses drummer Brain on several tracks of production music for an album called Eclectic Cinema. The album also features Guns N' Roses and Buckethead collaborator Pete Scaturro and future Guns N' Roses keyboardist Melissa Reese.

The western terminus is at US 19 Alt. and SR 687 in downtown St. Petersburg. The eastern terminus is at SR A1A in Daytona Beach. Like all AASHTO designated highways in Florida, US 92 always carries a FDOT designated hidden state road number: *State Road 687 from the US route's western terminus at US 19 Alt/SR 595 to the junction with SR 686/SR 687/SR 694 in St. Petersburg. *State Road 600 from the junction with SR 686/SR 687/SR 694 in St. Petersburg to George Jenkins Boulevard in Lakeland, and again from East Gary Road in Lakeland to the route's eastern terminus at State Road A1A in Daytona Beach. *State Road 517 from George Jenkins Boulevard (SR 600 east) to Memorial Boulevard (SR 546 west) in Lakeland. *State Road 546 from Memorial Boulevard to East Gary Road (SR 600 west) in Lakeland. Route description US 92 is concurrent with SR 687 from downtown St. Petersburg to SR 600, SR 686 and SR 694 at the west end of the Gandy Causeway; unsigned SR 600 from the west end of the Gandy Causeway to west of downtown Lakeland; unsigned State Road 517 west of downtown Lakeland; SR 546 from west of downtown Lakeland to east of downtown Lakeland; and unsigned State Road 600 from east of downtown Lakeland to Daytona Beach. =Tampa Bay Area= US 92 begins along State Road 687 at the intersection of SR 595 in St. Petersburg. The road continues north along SR 687 until it reaches the eastern termini of State Road 686 and State Road 694, where it turns right on Gandy Boulevard (State Road 600) before crossing the Gandy Bridge into Tampa. After crossing the Gandy Bridge, US 92 intersects West Shore Boulevard and runs east along Gandy Boulevard until it reaches Dale Mabry Highway at the first interchange with the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway where it turns north. State Road 685 branches to the northeast at Henderson Boulevard. The next major intersections are Kennedy Boulevard (SR 60), then Interstate 275 at Exits 41 A. In between SR 616 and SR 574, US 92 passes George M. Steinbrenner Field and Raymond James Stadium. A parclo interchange with Hillsborough Avenue takes US 92 from Dale Mabry to Hillsborough Avenue and State Road 580 from Hillsborough Avenue to Dale Mabry Highway. US 92 crosses two parallel bridges over the Hillsborough River, then intersects with BUS US 41, I-275 again at Exits 47 A-B, then intersects northbound U.S. Route 41 and SR 45, where US 41 and 92 overlap each other. One other major intersection exists with SR 585 before US 41 turns southbound as the concurrency ends. After SR 583, the road becomes part of the collective-distributor roads along Interstate 4 west and east of the parclo interchange with U.S. Route 301. The east end of the interchange contains a stub for a proposed west-to-northbound ramp to 301 at the westbound flyover. Access to Interstate 75 is only available eastbound from I-4. Three other local roads that cross US 92 access I-4 before State Roads 566, 39A (Alexander Road), 39, 574, and 533 in Plant City. Lake Alfred US 92 and U.S. Highway 17 join at the south end of Lake Alfred in Polk County. State Road 600 carries US 92 from Auburndale, while State Road 555 takes US 17 from the south via Winter Haven. County Road 555 soon splits to the north along the old road through Lake Alfred, while US 17/92 runs one block east on Lake Shore Way. County Road 557 begins at Haines Boulevard, where it heads west for a block to CR 555, and then turns north towards Interstate 4; just past CR 557, US 17/92 turns east towards Haines City. It enters downtown Haines City on Hinson Avenue after crossing under U.S. Highway 27 at a cloverleaf, meeting the north end of State Road 17 before turning north on 17th Street. It soon meets County Road 580, which runs east to Poinciana. In Davenport, US 92 meets County Road 547, which heads west to U.S. Highway 27 and north along old US 17/92. US 92 then intersects with Ronald Reagan Parkway (County Road 54) at Loughman. =Orlando area= After crossing into Osceola County, US 92 picks up the Orange Blossom Trail name. Orange Blossom Trail (OBT) takes US 92 east and north through Kissimmee and into Orlando. The OBT name temporarily ends at Pleasant Hill Road (former State Road 531) in southern Kissimmee, where US 92 uses John Young Parkway (formerly Bermuda Avenue) to Vine Street (U.S. Highway 192/SR 530). (US 92 ran through downtown Kissimmee on Emmett Street, Broadway and Main Street until ca. 2000.) It turns east there on US 192, turning north at Main Street, which becomes OBT at the north city limits. U.S. Highway 441 (along with State Road 500) joins US 92 at US 192 - thus OBT carries US 17, US 92 and US 441, as well as unsigned SR 500 and SR 600, from Kissimmee to Orlando. Along this stretch, the road intersects the Osceola Parkway in Kissimmee, SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay) at exit 11, and the Central Florida Parkway as it passes east of the resort area of Orlando that includes Walt Disney World and affiliated resorts, Sea World, and Universal Studios. The OBT then comes to a massive combined interchange with Florida's Turnpike and SR 528 (Beachline Expressway) in Sky Lake. North of this interchange, the road passes west of The Florida Mall and intersects SR 482\\\\. The road reaches an interchange with I-4 in Holden Heights. The OBT continues into Orlando and comes to a diamond interchange with SR 408 (East-West Tollway) at exit 9. Orange Blossom Trail bypasses downtown Orlando to the west, meeting State Road 50 (Colonial Drive) northwest of downtown. At SR 50, US 92 turns east, while US 441 continues northwest on OBT towards Apopka. US 92, concurrent with SR 50 (and SR 600), meets the south end of Edgewater Drive and crosses Interstate 4 (SR 400) and State Road 527 (Orange Avenue and Magnolia Avenue) before meeting Mills Avenue (State Road 15), where US 92 turns north. Mills Avenue carries State Road 15 on both sides of State Road 50, but is only signed as such to the south, as, north of SR 50, it carries US 92 (and unsigned SR 600). It crosses Lake Estelle on the Andrews Causeway before reaching the border between Orlando and Winter Park. In Winter Park, US 92's name changes to Orlando Avenue. It crosses State Road 527 (Orange Avenue) and State Road 426 (Fairbanks Avenue) and meets the east end of State Road 423 (Lee Road) while bypassing downtown Winter Park to the west. Shortly after crossing into Maitland, it passes under the SunRail tracks (formerly CSX Transportation's \\"A\\" Line), and the old road through downtown Winter Park — Park Avenue — merges in from the southeast. US 92 meets the east end of County Road 438A (Lake Avenue), which heads west to Eatonville, and then splits from the old alignment - County Road 427 - near downtown Maitland. It crosses Horatio Avenue (former County Road 436A) and meets the east end of State Road 414 (Maitland Boulevard) before crossing into Seminole County. In Seminole County, the redevelopment of the 17-92 Community Redevelopment Area is handled by the US 17-92 Community Redevelopment Agency, a component unit of the County government. In Seminole County, US 92 is a main commercial strip as it heads through Casselberry (where it crosses State Road 436 - Semoran Boulevard at an interchange) and Longwood (where it crosses State Road 434). North of Longwood it meets the north end of State Road 419 and crosses County Road 427 (the old alignment). Lake Mary Boulevard, Airport Boulevard and State Road 417 cross US 92 in southern Sanford, and it meets the west end of County Road 427A. At 25th Street, southwest of downtown Sanford, State Road 46 comes in from the east and turns north for a concurrency near downtown; County Road 46A heads west on 25th Street. 13th Street marks the west end of County Road 415, and at 1st Street the triple concurrency turns west. Before leaving the Sanford City Limits, the routes run over a bridge for a railroad line near the Sanford Amtrak Auto Train station, as well as the nearby SunRail station. The routes leave the concurrency with SR 46 at the north end of County Road 15 (once a branch of State Road 15), and then runs north towards the interchange with Interstate 4 (SR 400) where US 17/92 turns west along the south shore of Lake Monroe (part of the St. Johns River). Just before crossing the river into Volusia County at the west end of the lake, which runs unsigned with SR 15 and SR 600 here) and crosses under at the end of its own bridge across the river (the St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge). Ridgewood Ave. in Daytona Beach =DeBary to Daytona Beach= After crossing the St. Johns River via the Lake Monroe Bridge, US 92 continues north into Volusia County, meeting the west ends of County Road 4162 (in DeBary), County Road 4146, and County Road 4145 (in Orange City). North of Orange City is a trumpet interchange with State Road 472, a four-lane connection to Interstate 4. US 92 then crosses County Road 4116 and meets the south end of State Road 15A, a western bypass of DeLand. US 92 passes through downtown DeLand on Woodland Boulevard, crossing State Road 44 at New York Avenue. The intersection of US 92 and SR 44 does not allow any turns — right or left — and so adjacent city streets are marked for those turns. In northern DeLand, U.S. Highway 92 (SR 600) splits to the east on International Speedway Boulevard, while U.S. Highway 17 (SR 15) continues north. To the west of the split, International Speedway Boulevard is County Road 92, a short connection to State Road 15A that allows traffic on US 92 to bypass downtown DeLand. SR 15A itself rejoins US 17 north of DeLand. From DeLand to its terminus in Daytona Beach, US 92 carries the local name, International Speedway Boulevard, as the highway passes by the Daytona International Speedway. US 92 passes by other landmarks such as Daytona Beach International Airport and Volusia Mall. US 92 spans the Halifax River and Intracoastal Waterway via the Broadway Bridge before reaching its eastern terminus at SR A1A. History A US 92 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 92 was in the original 1926 plan, connecting Tampa (concurrent with US 41) to US 1 in Daytona Beach. It had been the Dixie Highway Tampa-St. Petersburg Loop from Plant City to Haines City, the West Mainline from Haines City to Orlando, and the East Florida Connector from Orlando to DeLand. US 92 was signed along the following roads in 1927: * SR 17 from Tampa to Haines City * SR 2 from Haines City to Orlando * SR 3 from Orlando to DeLand * SR 21 from DeLand to Daytona Beach When the bypass of downtown Tampa on SR 17 (Hillsborough Avenue) opened in the early 1930s, US 92 and US 41 were rerouted to use it. US 92 turned south from the new road where US 41 turned north, at Nebraska Avenue (former SR 5, probably then a spur of SR 5), and continued to end in downtown Tampa. A 1942 map shows US 92 extended west along SR 17 and SR 229 to end at US 19 in Dunedin; it was soon truncated back to Tampa. In the 1945 renumbering, the whole route of US 92 was numbered SR 600, except for the section south to downtown Tampa, which was SR 45. It was extended west and south to downtown St. Petersburg along SR 600 and SR 687 in 1953. In 1947, the route was extended east in Daytona Beach across the Intracoastal Waterway and the Halifax River after the Broadway Bridge was reconstructed and opened. In 1961, US 92 was moved to bypass downtown Lakeland, along SR 517 and SR 546. The old route was signed as Business US 92 until 1998. Until 1999, 92 ran through downtown Kissimmee on Emmett Street, Broadway and Main Street, along with US 17. In 2006, US 92 (along with US 17) was re-signed to bypass downtown Kissimmee, moving it to US 192 from John Young Parkway to US 441. In late 2013, the Florida Department of Transportation began an $80 million project to construct a flyover interchange with US 17-92 traveling over SR 436 in Casselberry. This interchange was built to alleviate congestion at one of the busiest intersections in Florida. The flyover interchange was completed on April 6, 2015, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held. Major intersections Special routes =Lakeland business route= U.S. Business Route 92 in Lakeland, Florida was a business route designed to keep trucks from entering Downtown Lakeland that followed State Road 600 between 1961 and 1998. The route began where US 92 turned north onto SR 517. It runs along George Jenkins Boulevard, then makes a sharp southeast turn along Sloan Avenue, while George Jenkins Boulevard becomes SR 548. Sloan Avenue becomes a divided highway between the bridge beneath the CSX line, only to emerge at the intersection of West Main Street where it turns east. The road's major intersections include a partial interchange with SR 563, and then SR 37, where West Main Street becomes East Main Street. The road makes a brief left turn onto Massachusetts Avenue in front of Lake Mirror for one block, then turns right at the end of Cedar Street where it runs along the north shore of Lake Mirror passing by Lakeland Amtrak Station. East Main makes a sharp right turn to the south before the intersection of Rose Street, then turns east again at the intersection of East Lake Street.

Larvae of this family are known as flatheaded borers. The family is among the largest of the beetles, with some 15,500 species known in 775 genera. In addition, almost 100 fossil species have been described. The larger and more spectacularly colored jewel beetles are highly prized by insect collectors. The elytra of some Buprestidae species have been traditionally used in beetlewing jewellery and decoration in certain countries in Asia, like India, Thailand and Japan. Description and ecology Shape is generally cylindrical or elongate to ovoid, with lengths ranging from , although most species are under . Catoxantha, Chrysaspis, Euchroma and Megaloxantha contain the largest species. A variety of bright colors are known, often in complicated patterns. The iridescence common to these beetles is not due to pigments in the exoskeleton, but instead is caused by structural coloration, in which microscopic texture in their cuticle selectively reflects specific frequencies of light in particular directions. This is the same effect that makes a compact disc reflect multiple colors. The larvae bore through roots, logs, stems, and leaves of various types of plants, ranging from trees to grasses. The wood boring types generally favor dying or dead branches on otherwise-healthy trees, while a few types attack green wood; some of these are serious pests capable of killing trees and causing major economic damage, such as the invasive emerald ash borer. Some species are attracted to recently burned forests to lay their eggs. They can sense pine wood smoke from up to 50 miles away, and can see infrared light, helping them to zero in as they get closer to a forest fire. Ten species of flatheaded borers of the family Buprestidae feed on spruce and fir, but hemlock is their preferred food source (Rose and Lindquist 1985).Rose, A.H.; Lindquist, O.H. 1985. Insects of eastern spruces, fir and, hemlock, revised edition. Gov’t Can., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa, For. Tech. Rep. 23. 159 p. (cited in Coates et al. 1994, cited orig ed 1977) As with roundheaded borers, most feeding occurs in dying or dead trees, or close to injuries on living trees. Damage becomes abundant only where a continuing supply of breeding material is available. The life history of these borers is similar to that of the roundheaded borers, but some exceedingly long life cycles have been reported under adverse conditions. Full-grown larvae, up to 25 mm long, are characteristically flattened, the anterior part of the body being much broader than the rest. The bronzed adults are usually seen only where suitable material occurs in sunny locations. Systematics Jewel beetle classification is not yet robustly established, although there appear to be five or six main lineages, which may be considered subfamilies, possibly with one or two being raised to families in their own right. Some other systems define up to 14 subfamilies. The commonly accepted subfamilies, with some representative genera, are: Oak Splendour Beetle (Agrilus biguttatus) specimen (Agrilinae) Eurythyrea austriaca specimen (Buprestinae) Temognatha alternata, a Buprestinae 2.6cm long from Cooktown, Australia Capnodis cariosa specimen (Chrysochroinae) Julodis ehrenbergii specimen from Greece (Julodinae) Acmaeodera species (Polycestinae) Agrilinae - cosmopolitan, with most taxa occurring in the Northern Hemisphere * Agrilus Curtis, 1825 * Anodontodora Obenberger, 1931 * Asymades Kerremans, 1893 * Brachys Dejean, 1833 * Chalcophlocteis Obenberger, 1924 * Discoderoides Théry, 1936 * Entomogaster Saunders, 1871 * Ethiopoeus Bellamy, 2008 * Madecorformica Bellamy, 2008 * Meliboeus Deyrolle, 1864 * Pachyschelus Solier, 1833 * Paracylindromorphus Thery, 1930 * Paradorella Obenberger, 1923 * Pseudokerremansia Bellamy & Holm, 1985 * Strandietta Obenberger, 1931 Buprestinae - cosmopolitan * Agrilozodes Thery, 1927 * Anthaxia Eschscholtz, 1829 * Bubastoides * Buprestis * Calodema - found only in Australia and New Guinea; usually in rain forests * Castiarina - about 500 species, found only in Australia and New Guinea, previously considered a subgenus of Stigmodera * Chrysobothris * Colobogaster * Conognatha * Eurythyrea * Hiperantha * Metaxymorpha - found only in Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia; usually in rain forests * Stigmodera - 7 species remain here * Temognatha - About 83-85 species, found only in Australia and New Guinea, previously considered a subgenus of Stigmodera Chrysochroinae * Capnodis * Chalcophora * Chrysochroa * Chrysodema Laporte & Gory, 1835 (= Cyalithoides) * Euchroma * Halecia * Lampetis Dejean, 1833 - sometimes included in the tribe Psilopterini, but actually not very close to Psiloptera (tentatively placed here) * Lampropepla * Perotis * Psiloptera (tentatively placed here) Galbellinae * Galbella Julodinae * Aaata * Amblysterna * Julodella * Julodis * Neojulodis * Sternocera Polycestinae * Acmaeodera File:Jewel Beetle.JPGUnidentified species from Pune (India) File:Jewel beetle.jpgUnidentified species from Swifts Creek (Victoria, Australia) File:Kerremans.Monographie.des.Buprestides.06.jpgBuprestinae (center right and lower left), Julodinae (center) and Polycestinae (others) from Charles Kerremans' Monographie des Buprestides File:Prachtkäfer aus der Grube Messel.JPGFossil jewel beetle from the Eocene, found in the Messel Pit (Germany) File:Buprestidae pon vandu.jpgSternocera sp., Tamil Nadu File:Jewel beetle (Chrysochroa fulminans), Mindanao, Philippines 08.jpgChrysochroa fulminans from Mindanao, Philippines File:Boite Buprestidae Asie sud est GLAM muséum Lille 2016.JPGCollection of Buprestidae from Southeast Asia in Musée d'Histoire Naturelle de Lille References Further reading * (2002): Buprestidae.

It was established in 1933 as a route between Pensacola and Apalachicola, Florida, and has since been extended westward into Mississippi and eastward across the Florida Peninsula. It runs along much of the Gulf Coast between Mobile, Alabama, and Crystal River, Florida, including extensive sections closely following the coast between Mobile and St. Marks, Florida. The highway's western terminus is with US 84 in Meadville, Mississippi. Its eastern terminus is Palm Beach, Florida, at State Road A1A (SR A1A) near the Mar-a-Lago resort. Route description U.S. 98's western terminus is in Mississippi, and its eastern terminus is in Florida. Much of its route through Alabama and Florida falls within coastal counties. =Mississippi= U.S. 98 enters the state from the southeast and immediately widens to four lanes. It bypasses Lucedale to the north, and an interchange with Mississippi Highway 63 provides four-laned access to Pascagoula on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, increasing road capacity for hurricane evacuations. At Hattiesburg, an interchange with U.S. Route 49 provides four-laned access to Gulfport (to the south) and Jackson (to the north). The road continues west from its intersection with U.S. 49 to Interstate 59 at Exit 59, with which it is concurrent through Exit 65 (Hardy Street). The highway runs westward through Columbia before meeting U.S. 51 in McComb. It then joins Interstate 55 from Exit 15 (South McComb) to Exit 20 (Summit). The last remaining two-laned section of U.S. 98 in Mississippi then runs northwestward to its terminus near Bude in Meadville at US 84. https://mdot.ms.gov/documents/Planning/Statistics/Book/2017%20MDOT%20Public%20Roads%20Statistics%20Extent,%20Travel,%20and%20Designation.pdf U.S. 98 serves as a primary hurricane evacuation route in southern Mississippi, connecting cities along the Mississippi Sound to inland destinations further north. The Mississippi section of U.S. 98 is defined in Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3. =Alabama= In Alabama, US 98 is paired with unsigned State Route 42 (SR 42). The route enters Alabama from the east near Lillian in rural Baldwin County. At Daphne, US 98 begins a concurrency with US 90. US 90 and 98 junction I-10 at Daphne on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, then again on the western side of the bay as they enter downtown Mobile. As the two routes approach the Mobile River, US 98 is split into two routes, with a Truck Route 98 crossing the Mobile River via the Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge, co-signed with US 90. Passenger car traffic passes directly into town under the Mobile River via the Bankhead Tunnel. Once the Truck Route rejoins the main route in downtown Mobile, US 98 assumes a northwestward trajectory, and enters Mississippi near the community of Wilmer in western Mobile County. US 98 is the southern terminus of two major U.S. highways: US 31, at Spanish Fort, and US 45 in Mobile. The safety of the route, or the lack thereof, has earned the road the nickname \\"Bloody 98\\". A plan to remediate the problem has not been adopted, and is hampered by the financial damage imposed to road repairs by higher vehicle fuel efficiency (as gas taxes largely go to road repair) and the diversion of roadway funds to other projects like greenways and public transportation. Also, environmentalists have gone to court on numerous occasions to block proposals to turn the stretch of US 98 from the Alabama–Mississippi line to the town of Semmes, Alabama, into a four-lane, fearing that construction runoff would cause contamination of Big Creek Lake (where Mobile gets its municipal water supply) and its surrounding wetlands.Highway 98 accident history on display post deaths'Bloody 98' in Florida named most dangerous roadwayRoad to nowhere: U.S. 98 project in Mobile remains unfinished =Florida= A US 98 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 Palm Beach. Within Florida, US 98 is marked as an east-west road from the Alabama-Florida border to Perry. Throughout the rest of the state, the road is marked as a north-south road. Concurrencies include US 441 from Royal Palm Beach to Okeechobee, US 27 from South Sebring to West Frostproof, US 17 from Fort Meade to Bartow, US 301 from Clinton Heights to Moss Town, SR 50 from Ridge Manor to Brooksville, SR 50A then US 41 in Brooksville, US 19 from Chassahowitzka to Perry, ALT US 27 from Chiefland to Perry, US 319 in Medart and from St. Theresa to Port St. Joe, and US 90 in Pensacola. The hidden designation for most of US 98 across the panhandle of the state of Florida is State Route 30. Between Chassahowitzka and Palm Beach, the hidden designation is State Route 700. There is a 60 mph speed limit east of Tyndall Air Force Base outside of Panama City all the way to Perry. History US 98 was first commissioned in 1934. At that time, its entire route was within Florida, traveling from Pensacola to Apalachicola. In 1952, the eastern end was extended to its present terminus in Palm Beach, Florida. In 1955, the western terminus was extended westward to Natchez, Mississippi. In 1999, the western end of US 98 was truncated to its intersection with US 84 at Meadville, Mississippi, although it continued to be signed concurrently with US 84 to Washington, Mississippi until 2008.Dale Sanderson.

Family Vespidae The Vespoidea are a superfamily of wasps in the order Hymenoptera, although older taxonomic schemes may vary in this categorization, particularly in their recognition of a now-obsolete superfamily Scolioidea, as well as the relationship to ants. Vespoidea includes wasps with a large variety of lifestyles; eusocial, social, and solitary habits, predators, scavengers, parasitoids, and some herbivores.  Description  Vespoid wasp females have antennae with 10 flagellomeres, while males have 11 flagellomeres. The edge of the pronotum reaches or passes the tegula. Many species display some level of sexual dimorphism. Most species have fully developed wings, but some have reduced or absent wings in one or both sexes. As in other Aculeata, only the females are ever capable of stinging.

Additionally, superfamily Apoidea is found to nest within the Vespoidea, suggesting the dismantling of Vespoidea (sensu lato) into many smaller superfamilies; Formicoidea, Scolioidea, Tiphioidea, Thynnoidea, and Pompiloidea in addition to a much more narrowly defined Vespoidea. Finally, families Mutillidae, Tiphiidae, and Bradynobaenidae were found to be paraphyletic. Another recent study confirms the need for revision of high- level relationships, although the pattern of sister-group relationships within the putative Vespoidea matches the same basic pattern as the 2008 study, including a paraphyletic Bradynobaenidae and Tiphiidae.

In his twenties, Edgar was a law student, legal editor of the Toronto Globe, an alderman on Toronto's city council and an organizer for the Liberal Party in Ontario. He was also rare among English Canadians of the time for his sympathy for the rights of French-Canadians. Edgar was married to Matilda Ridout and together they had nine children. Born in Hatley, Canada East (later Quebec), Edgar was educated in Lennoxville and Quebec City. He moved to Toronto as an adult and became a lawyer in 1864. He was elected an alderman in 1866, and was a supporter of George Brown and the Reform Party. He ran as a Liberal in the 1871 Ontario provincial election, but was defeated by a margin of four votes in his attempt to win a seat in the provincial legislature. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1872 federal election, and became Whip in the caucus of Alexander Mackenzie. He helped bring down the Conservative government over the Pacific Scandal. However, despite the election of a Liberal government in the ensuing election, Edgar was defeated in his own riding. In 1874, he started a railway company called the Ontario and Pacific Junction Railway. This was an attempt to build a line between Toronto and Lake Nipissing. In 1881, it was renamed the Ontario and Sault Ste. Marie Railway. Both ventures failed to win a contract. Fred Cumberland, a partner in the O&PJR; venture, formed a rival company called the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. In 1888, the N&PJR; merged with the Grand Trunk Railway. Edgar was undaunted by these setbacks and in 1889 started a new company called the Belt Line Railway in Toronto. The city's steep ravines made access to some areas very difficult. The land developers of these areas required either a commuter railway or a system of bridges to ease access to their properties for buyers. This new venture sought to build a commuter rail line in Toronto connecting downtown with undeveloped neighbourhoods as far north as Eglinton Avenue between the Don River and the Humber River. Eventually two rail loops were built with 44 stations in total. The passenger railway opened in 1892 but ran for only two years, four months before going bankrupt. (The city built bridges, eventually.) He used his experience to become the Liberal's railway critic when he returned to Parliament (and the Opposition benches) through an 1884 by-election. In the 1880s, Edgar became a vocal opponent of the Protestant Protective Association, an anti-Catholic political party associated with the Ontario Conservative Party. He argued in favour of tolerance and cooperation between English and French Canadians as well as between Protestants and Catholics. He also argued against the concept of Imperial Federation, for greater Canadian independence from Britain, and in favour of reciprocity with the United States. When the Liberals formed a government under Sir Wilfrid Laurier following the 1896 federal election, Edgar was nominated to become Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and was given a knighthood by Queen Victoria. Edgar was in poor health, however, and died in 1899 prior to the end of this term.  External links   Russell, C.H. 1996. Tightening the belt: a history of the Toronto Belt Line Railway.

He is best known as the former drummer and co-songwriter of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s. Adler was fired from Guns N' Roses over his heroin addiction in 1990, following which he reformed his pre-Guns N' Roses band Road Crew and briefly joined BulletBoys. During the 2000s, Adler was the drummer of the band Adler's Appetite, and from 2012, he had held the same position in the band Adler. In early 2017, he declared that he has no intention to continue with the band and that the band has now dissolved, with the reason being his lack of interest in performing during poorly attended concerts. He appeared on the second and fifth seasons of the reality TV show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, as well as on the first season of its spin-off Sober House. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Guns N' Roses.  Life and career  = 1965–1984: Early life and career = Adler was born Michael Coletti in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of an Italian-American father, Michael Coletti, and a Jewish American mother, Deanna. After his father left the family, his mother moved with her children to Los Angeles, California. Steven was named after his father at birth, but his mother renamed him Steven when she returned to her parents because Ashkenazi Jewish naming conventions forbid children from being named after living individuals. Steven took the surname Adler after his mother's marriage to Melvin Adler, who adopted her two oldest children. He has an older brother, Kenny, and a younger half-brother, Jamie. Adler grew up in the San Fernando Valley until the age of 13, when he was sent to live with his grandparents in Hollywood due to his bad behavior. At Bancroft Junior High, Adler befriended Saul Hudson, later known as Slash; they met when Adler had a skateboarding accident and Slash stopped to help him. After ninth grade, Adler returned to his parents' house in the Valley for the remainder of high school, during which time he learned to play drums. After his return to Hollywood in 1983, Adler auditioned for Sunset Strip staple London. When the audition proved unsuccessful, he formed the band Road Crew—named after the Motörhead song \\"(We Are) The Road Crew\\"—with his childhood friend Slash. They placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what would become the Guns N' Roses song \\"Rocket Queen.\\" Slash disbanded the group the following year due to their inability to find an adequate lead vocalist, as well as Adler's laziness compared to himself and McKagan. Adler then briefly joined a local band known as Hollywood Rose, which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin (who left shortly after). = 1985–1990: Guns N' Roses = In June 1985, Adler joined Guns N' Roses, which was newly founded by Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, and L.A. Guns members Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner. After the original drummer Gardner quit, Adler and Slash joined their former Road Crew bandmate Duff McKagan (who joined in April 1985) to complete the line-up. They played nightclubs—such as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour—and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. After being scouted by several major record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In July 1987, Guns N' Roses released its debut album, Appetite for Destruction, which to date has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which were in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US. In December, during a tour with Alice Cooper, an intoxicated Adler broke his hand when he punched a streetlight after a barroom brawl; Fred Coury of Cinderella was brought in as his substitute for several shows until he recovered. In November 1988, Guns N' Roses released G N' R Lies, which sold over five million copies in the US alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide. Adler was again absent during a performance at the American Music Awards in January 1989; Don Henley filled in for him on drums. His absence was originally attributed to a case of the flu, but it was later revealed that Adler had been in a drug rehabilitation program at the time. The following October, during a show as opening act for The Rolling Stones, Axl Rose threatened to leave the band if certain members of the band didn't stop \\"dancing with Mr. Brownstone,\\" a reference to their song of the same name about heroin use. Adler was among those who promised to clean up, but he continued to struggle with his addiction. Adler was briefly fired from the band over his drug use in early 1990, but he was reinstated after signing a contract in which he vowed to stop taking drugs. However, by the time the band entered the studio to record the song \\"Civil War\\", his addiction had become so severe that he was unable to perform. By Adler's own admission, he tried to play the song \\"20, maybe 30 times.\\" The song's drum track had to be heavily edited just for his bandmates to be able to play along with it. When problems in the studio continued, causing recording sessions to abort for several days at a time, Adler was formally fired from Guns N' Roses on July 11, 1990. He had played his final show with the band on April 7 at Farm Aid IV. Izzy Stradlin, who left the band in November 1991, later stated that replacing Adler with Matt Sorum of The Cult had a big impact on the band's sound. In response to an interviewer's suggestion that the line-up change had turned Guns N' Roses from a rock 'n' roll band into a heavy metal one, Stradlin said, \\"Yeah, a big musical difference. ... [Our songs] were written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel. When that was gone, it was just...unbelievable, weird. Nothing worked. I would have preferred to continue with Steve, but we'd had two years off and we couldn't wait any longer.\\" = 1990–2002: Post-Guns N' Roses troubles and hiatus = Following his departure from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, he was set to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, \\"I wish I could say that I did a lot of traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time.\\" A year after his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler filed a lawsuit against his former Guns N' Roses bandmates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox interfered with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, \\"I was told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me any more and just wanted me gone.\\" The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a back-payment check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure. On May 5, 1995, Adler was arrested at his home in Calabasas on a felony charge of heroin possession. In 1996, Adler suffered a stroke and was briefly comatose after taking a particularly potent speedball—a cocktail of heroin and cocaine used intravenously—which caused a temporary paralysis of the left side of his face, resulting in a speech impediment. The following year, he pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in relation to a domestic violence charge involving a woman with whom he had been living; he was sentenced to four days in jail, three years' probation, and mandatory drug counseling. In June 1998, Adler joined the newly reformed hard rock band BulletBoys, along with future Guns N' Roses guitarist DJ Ashba. The group recorded an album and announced a US summer tour with Faster Pussycat, Bang Tango and Enuff Z'nuff. However, Adler's return to music was cut short the following September, when he pleaded no contest to two counts of battery stemming from attacks on two other women in separate domestic violence incidents. He was sentenced to a 150-day term in prison and three years' probation, with the condition of undergoing a year of domestic violence counseling and a ban on using illegal drugs. = 2003–2011: Adler's Appetite and reality TV = In 2003, Adler formed the band Suki Jones, later renamed Adler's Appetite, with singer Jizzy Pearl, former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, and former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane. With an ever-changing line-up due to members' previous commitments, the band toured the US and Europe throughout 2003 and 2004, playing mostly songs off Guns N' Roses' debut album Appetite for Destruction, as well as material by Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, and Queen. In September 2003, Adler's Appetite performed a show at the Key Club in Hollywood, where they were joined on stage by Adler's former Guns N' Roses bandmates Slash and Izzy Stradlin, for renditions of \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"Paradise City\\", and \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\". In January 2005, Adler's Appetite—minus Brent Muscat, who had departed the band—released through their official website a self-titled EP, which featured four original songs and the covers \\"Hollywood\\" by Thin Lizzy and \\"Draw the Line\\" by Aerosmith. The release was followed by a tour of the US, Europe, Japan, and Argentina. Later that year, the band announced plans to release a full-length album through Shrapnel Records, but it failed to materialize. In July 2007, the group played another show at the Key Club, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction, during which they were joined on stage by former Guns N' Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan. Although Slash was also in attendance, he did not join the band on stage, stating that he did not want to encourage the notion of a Guns N' Roses reunion. In 2008, Adler participated in the second season of the reality TV show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. The show's resident medical expert, Dr. Drew Pinsky, regarded Adler as the \\"problem child\\" of the group; he described his behavior as \\"suicidal\\" and revealed that Adler had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks prior to entering rehab. Adler also participated in the first season of the Celebrity Rehab spin-off Sober House. During the show's filming in July, an intoxicated Adler became so aggressive towards his cast mates that he was arrested at the Sober House premises. He was convicted of being under the influence of a controlled substance and sentenced to community service. The following January, he was arrested again for failure to complete his community service in the time frame stipulated by the judge. In 2010, Adler collaborated with his former Guns N' Roses bandmate Slash on the latter's self-titled debut solo album, which was released in April. He appeared on the track \\"Baby Can't Drive\\", along with Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Alice Cooper, and Nicole Scherzinger. The song was featured on an expanded edition of the album released by Classic Rock. The following July, Adler's Appetite—consisting of Adler, singer Rick Stitch, guitarists Michael Thomas and Alex Grossi, and bassist Chip Z'nuff—released the single \\"Alive\\", in conjunction with the release of Adler's autobiography My Appetite for Destruction: Sex, and Drugs, and Guns N' Roses. In December, the band released two more singles, entitled \\"Stardog\\" and \\"Fading\\". In 2011, following another relapse, Adler participated in the fifth season of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. =2011–2017: Adler and guest appearance with Guns N' Roses= In 2011, Adler formed a new band, simply called Adler, with guitarist Lonny Paul, who had been a member of Adler's Appetite prior to the breakup, and singer-guitarist Jacob Bunton of Lynam and formerly of Mars Electric, with the lineup later rounded out by former L.A. Guns member Johnny Martin on bass. Steven Adler stated, \\"I love the music that we're creating! I haven't been this excited about my band since the Guns N' Roses days.\\" The band recorded their debut album in Los Angeles with producers Jeff Pilson and Jay Ruston. Titled Back from the Dead, the album features guest appearances from Slash and John 5, and was released on November 26, 2012, via New Ocean Media. The album's release was preceded by the single \\"The One That You Hated\\", which was released on April 10 via iTunes. On April 14, 2012, Adler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the classic lineup of Guns N' Roses. He headlined the induction ceremony with fellow inductees Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum, as well as former member Gilby Clarke and Slash's collaborator Myles Kennedy. Adler stated that being inducted was \\"an honor and a dream come true.\\" In late October and early November 2012, Adler played on the Kiss Kruise, which sailed from Florida to the Bahamas. These shows marked the band's first-ever live performances. The following year, Adler's scheduled U.S. tour was postponed when Steven Adler checked into a rehab facility to \\"continue working on his sobriety.\\" On the July 6, 2016 stop of the Not in This Lifetime... Tour in Cincinnati, Ohio, Adler joined Guns N' Roses for performances of \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" and \\"My Michelle\\", which marked his first appearance with the band since his firing in 1990. He made other guest appearances during shows in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Buenos Aires. He was also rumored to take part in the band's surprise April 1 show at the Troubadour, but had back surgery which forced him to pull out. =2018–present: Adler's Appetite reformation= In 2018, guitarist Alex Grossi announced that Adler's Appetite will return to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction.Adler reunion In 2019, Adler and his band performed on Kiss Kruise IX.

Most coronagraphs are intended to view the corona of the Sun, but a new class of conceptually similar instruments (called stellar coronagraphs to distinguish them from solar coronagraphs) are being used to find extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks around nearby stars as well as host galaxies in quasars and other similar objects with active galactic nuclei (AGN). Coronagraph image of the Sun Invention The coronagraph was introduced in 1931 by the French astronomer Bernard Lyot; since then, coronagraphs have been used at many solar observatories. Coronagraphs operating within Earth's atmosphere suffer from scattered light in the sky itself, due primarily to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. At view angles close to the Sun, the sky is much brighter than the background corona even at high altitude sites on clear, dry days. Ground-based coronagraphs, such as the High Altitude Observatory's Mark IV Coronagraph on top of Mauna Loa, use polarization to distinguish sky brightness from the image of the corona: both coronal light and sky brightness are scattered sunlight and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is Thomson-scattered at nearly a right angle and therefore undergoes scattering polarization, while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized. Design Wendelstein Observatory Coronagraph instruments are extreme examples of stray light rejection and precise photometry because the total brightness from the solar corona is less than one millionth the brightness of the Sun. The apparent surface brightness is even fainter because, in addition to delivering less total light, the corona has a much greater apparent size than the Sun itself. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon acts as an occluding disk and any camera in the eclipse path may be operated as a coronagraph until the eclipse is over. More common is an arrangement where the sky is imaged onto an intermediate focal plane containing an opaque spot; this focal plane is reimaged onto a detector. Another arrangement is to image the sky onto a mirror with a small hole: the desired light is reflected and eventually reimaged, but the unwanted light from the star goes through the hole and does not reach the detector. Either way, the instrument design must take into account scattering and diffraction to make sure that as little unwanted light as possible reaches the final detector. Lyot's key invention was an arrangement of lenses with stops, known as Lyot stops, and baffles such that light scattered by diffraction was focused on the stops and baffles, where it could be absorbed, while light needed for a useful image missed them. As an example, imaging instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope offer coronagraphic capability. =Band-limited coronagraph= A band-limited coronagraph uses a special kind of mask called a band-limited mask. This mask is designed to block light and also manage diffraction effects caused by removal of the light. The band-limited coronagraph has served as the baseline design for the canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder coronagraph. Band-limited masks will also be available on the James Webb Space Telescope. =Phase-mask coronagraph= A phase-mask coronagraph (such as the so-called four-quadrant phase-mask coronagraph) uses a transparent mask to shift the phase of the stellar light in order to create a self-destructive interference, rather than a simple opaque disc to block it. =Optical vortex coronagraph= An optical vortex coronagraph uses a phase- mask in which the phase-shift varies azimuthally around the center. Several varieties of optical vortex coronagraphs exist: * the scalar optical vortex coronagraph based on a phase ramp directly etched in a dielectric material, like fused silica.Optical vortex coronagraph * the vector(ial) vortex coronagraph employs a mask that rotates the angle of polarization of photons, and ramping this angle of rotation has the same effect as ramping a phase- shift. A mask of this kind can be synthesized by various technologies, ranging from liquid crystal polymer (same technology as in 3D television), and micro- structured surfaces (using microfabrication technologies from the microelectronics industry). Such a vector vortex coronagraph made out of liquid crystal polymers is currently in use at the 200-inch Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory. It has recently been operated with adaptive optics to image extrasolar planets. This works with stars other than the sun because they are so far away their light is, for this purpose, a spatially coherent plane wave. The coronagraph using interference masks out the light along the center axis of the telescope, but allows the light from off axis objects through. Satellite-based coronagraphs Coronagraphs in outer space are much more effective than the same instruments would be if located on the ground. This is because the complete absence of atmospheric scattering eliminates the largest source of glare present in a terrestrial coronagraph. Several space missions such as NASA-ESA's SOHO, and NASA's SPARTAN, Solar Maximum Mission, and Skylab have used coronagraphs to study the outer reaches of the solar corona. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is able to perform coronagraphy using the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), and there are plans to have this capability on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) using its Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI). While space-based coronagraphs such as LASCO avoid the sky brightness problem, they face design challenges in stray light management under the stringent size and weight requirements of space flight. Any sharp edge (such as the edge of an occulting disk or optical aperture) causes Fresnel diffraction of incoming light around the edge, which means that the smaller instruments that one would want on a satellite unavoidably leak more light than larger ones would. The LASCO C-3 coronagraph uses both an external occulter (which casts shadow on the instrument) and an internal occulter (which blocks stray light that is Fresnel-diffracted around the external occulter) to reduce this leakage, and a complicated system of baffles to eliminate stray light scattering off the internal surfaces of the instrument itself. Extrasolar planets The coronagraph has recently been adapted to the challenging task of finding planets around nearby stars. While stellar and solar coronagraphs are similar in concept, they are quite different in practice because the object to be occulted differs by a factor of a million in linear apparent size. (The Sun has an apparent size of about 1900 arcseconds, while a typical nearby star might have an apparent size of 0.0005 and 0.002 arcseconds.) Earth-like exoplanet detection requires contrast. To achieve such contrast requires extreme optothermal stability. A stellar coronagraph concept was studied for flight on the canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder mission. On ground-based telescopes, a stellar coronagraph can be combined with adaptive optics to search for planets around nearby stars. In November 2008, NASA announced that a planet was directly observed orbiting the nearby star Fomalhaut. The planet could be seen clearly on images taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys' coronagraph in 2004 and 2006. The dark area hidden by the coronagraph mask can be seen on the images, though a bright dot has been added to show where the star would have been. Direct image of exoplanets around the star HR8799 using a vector vortex coronagraph on a 1.5m portion of the Hale telescope Up until the year 2010, telescopes could only directly image exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated that a vector vortex coronagraph could enable small telescopes to directly image planets. They did this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets using just a portion of the Hale Telescope.

He was a commentator for TV One, the host of News One Now, and Washington on Watch With Roland S. Martin. He was also a CNN contributor, appearing on a variety of shows, including The Situation Room, Anderson Cooper's AC360, and many others. In October 2008, he joined the Tom Joyner Morning Show as senior analyst. Books authored by Martin include Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America, Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith and The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House as originally reported by Roland S. Martin. Life and career Martin was born in Houston, Texas. His maternal great-grandparents had migrated from Haiti to Louisiana, where his family originates. He graduated with a B.S. in journalism from Texas A&M; University and a master's degree in Christian communications from Louisiana Baptist University. He is the former executive editor of the Chicago Defender. Martin hosts a morning radio talk show on WVON in Chicago, and was with CNN as a contributor from 2007 to 2013. He guest-hosted Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull while Brown was on maternity leave in April and May 2009. He became the host of TV One's first Sunday News show Washington Watch with Roland Martin in 2009. It ran for 4 years and is currently off the air. In March 2013, Martin announced on Twitter that he was leaving CNN. His last day was on April 6, 2013. It was announced on July 9, 2013, that Martin would be the host of TV One's first live one-hour, weekday morning news program titled News One Now. The program premiered on November 4, 2013. On December 7, 2017, Martin announced on air that TV One had canceled the show due to low ratings from Black viewers, but that he would still remain involved with the network. On January 14, 2018, it was announced that Martin had won two NAACP Image Awards for the show. Also, Roland hosted a three-hour radio show called The Roland Martin Show. He currently hosts a web series, Roland Martin Unfiltered on YouTube. Issues Martin has defended Michael Steele and other black Republicans against charges of being \\"Uncle Toms\\", arguing that the label is inappropriate. Controversy On February 5, 2012, Roland Martin's Twitter account responded to an underwear advertisement featuring the association football player David Beckham, stating \\"If a dude at your Super Bowl party is hyped about David Beckham's H&M; underwear ad, smack the ish out of him!\\" GLAAD (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) responded on its website: “Martin’s tweets today advocating violence against gay people weren’t an accident — they are a part of a larger pattern for Martin. Anti-gay violence in America is a serious problem\\". In response to the tweets, it was reported that Roland Martin had been suspended by CNN for the controversial remarks. His suspension was lifted on March 14, 2012. In 2016 Martin was revealed to have leaked CNN town hall questions to former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, who then leaked them to Hillary Clinton's camp when he was acting as guest-moderator. According to Politico, in an email the day before the March town hall to senior Clinton staffers, then DNC Chair Donna Brazile wrote: “From time to time I get the questions in advance” and included the text of a question about the death penalty. An email later obtained by Politico showed that the text of the question Brazile sent to the Clinton campaign was identical to a proposed question Martin had offered CNN.

The girl is later named Daoprasook by the nurses because the planet Venus (\\"daoprasook\\" in Thai) was visible at the time of her birth. Later, a childless couple adopts Dao. However, as soon as they adopt her, the wife becomes pregnant and gives birth to a daughter. The mother favors her own daughters more than Dao and treats her like a servant behind the father's back. The young Dao is abused by her adoptive mother to the point where she decides to run away. Now on the streets, she uses her wits to survive until a kind-hearted prostitute takes her under her wings. Years later, Dao is now a beautiful teenager who is forced to work to help the kind prostitute who raised her. Of course, she is too moral to sell her body so she would lead her customers into a darkened room where she would switch another prostitute for herself. She soon gains a certain amount of fame with many men seeking her service. Khun Phak, a rich businessman meets Daoprasook and somehow makes a deal with the brothel's managing woman. He buys her and forces her to move into his house. What occurred next can be imagined. Phak at first despises Dao for being a prostitute who gave one of his friends an STD. He decides to have her tested. The result puzzles him greatly, as she is perfectly healthy. All this while, Dao is abused by a servant called Maew in Phak's house. Maew's loyalty lies with Mayarasamee, who wants to marry the wealthy Phak. Undaunted, Dao proves herself to Phak to be a lady and endures all verbal abuses directed at her. The only kindness she finds and by which she is comforted is from an elderly man, a businessman like Phak. However, she has secretly fallen in love with Phak and vice versa. Although he has been able to restrain himself from sexually abusing Dao all this time, the news of Dao's relationship with another man angered him. With a drunken rage, he storms into Dao's bedroom and begins to make sexual advances on the young girl. Dao, in a state of shock that Phak, who has been a gentleman in this matter, is trying to abuse her tries to fight back, only later losing because of her feelings to Phak. That night, they consummated their love. The next morning, upon seeing the blood stain on the bedsheet, Phak realizes that he is the first for Dao. She grieves over her lost virginity, because it was something that she has guarded dearly for a long time. In a twist of fate, the mother of Dao who abandoned her 18 years ago at the hospital meets her at Phak's house and recognizes her first daughter when she sees a heart-shaped scar on Dao's upper chest. She is now married with a young son. Convinced that the businessman (and he is) is in love with Dao, she reveals her secret to him, telling him that their affair produced a child, a daughter: Daoprasook. The truth comes out and changes Dao's status immediately. She is now the daughter of a respected woman and a rich businessman. Still she yearns for love from Phak, who she considers to be her husband. He also happens to be related to her as he is a cousin to Dao's mother, making her his second cousin. As can be expected from a lakorn, Phak reveals his true feelings to Dao and asks her to marry him. The lakorn ends with their lavish wedding.

Because most insects are small and the majority cannot be identified without the examination of minute morphological characters, entomologists often make and maintain insect collections. Very large collections are conserved in natural history museums or universities where they are maintained and studied by specialists. Many college courses require students to form small collections. There are also amateur entomologists and collectors who keep collections. Historically, insect collecting has been widespread and was in the Victorian age a very popular educational hobby. Insect collecting has left traces in European cultural history, literature and songs (e.g., Georges Brassens's La chasse aux papillons (The Hunt for Butterflies)). The practice is particularly common among Japanese youths. Collecting techniques Robinson light trap for collecting moths Insects are passively caught using funnels, pitfall traps, bottle traps, malaise traps, flight interception traps and other passive types of insect traps, some of which are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the Robinson trap are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or \\"pooters\\" suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.Martin, J.E.H. 1977. Collecting, preparing and preserving insects, mites, and spiders.

Archived PDF insect net Sweep netting for grassland insects Several different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. Aerial insect nets are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate butterfly wings. A sweep net is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy net fabric such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include beating nets and aquatic nets.Charles Valentine Riley, 1892 Directions for collecting and preserving insects Bulletin (United States National Museum) no. 39, pt.

Once collected, a killing jar is used to kill required insects before they damage themselves trying to escape. However, killing jars are generally only used on hard-bodied insects. Soft-bodied insects, such as those in the larval stage, are generally fixed in a vial containing an ethanol and water solution.Hongfu, Zhu, 1949 How to know the immature insects; an illustrated key for identifying the orders and families of many of the immature insects with suggestions for collecting, rearing and studying them, by H.

Storage and curation Equipment for preparation There are several different preservation methods that are used; some of which include: dried preservation (pinning), liquid preservation, slide mounts, other various preservation methods. Dried preservation is by far the most common form of insect preservation. The large majority of the time insects are pinned vertically through their mesothorax and slightly off-center to the right of the mid-line. It is better to pin a insect that has died recently enough that they have not dried yet because it allows the thoracic muscles to adhere to the pin (previously dried specimens must have glue applied to the pin location to avoid spinning). the pin should sit with 1/4 of the pin above the insect as to allow enough room for labels to be readable underneath. When pinning insects with wings for display it is important to display them properly: Lepidoptera wings should always be spread. Orthopteroids often have left wings spread. In scientific collections it is often found that the insect's wings, legs, and antenna are tucked underneath it to conserve space. When pin- mounting small insects the insect is glued to a piece of non acidic, triangle paper. This is called pointing. When drying an insect the relaxed insect is spread out accordingly using pins on a foam block where it can dry and retain its positioning. When drying insects with wings such as butterflies setting paper is used to position the wings.

Atchison is a Canadian politician who was mayor of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan from 2003 to 2016. He was first elected as mayor on October 22, 2003 in a close four-way contest. He was re-elected as mayor in 2006, 2009 and 2012. He lost his bid for a fifth term as mayor in 2016, when he was defeated by former city councillor Charlie Clark. Atchison was the longest-serving mayor in Saskatoon's history, at 13 years.  Political career  Prior to being mayor, Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon's city council as a councillor for Ward 10 in 1994, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. As a city councillor, he suggested a part of downtown Saskatoon should be enclosed by an $80 million 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium, dubbed the \\"Atreos.\\" He ran on a platform that included being tough on crime, freezing property taxes, and resuming control of the city's police commission. Atchison was known to be precise about his dress; his father owned a men's clothing store. On his first election as mayor, he required citizens visiting the Mayor's office to be formally dressed, a policy that was soon dropped after being criticized. Both points were ridiculed by CBC satirist Rick Mercer who sponsored an online contest in 2004 that went on to name Atchison \\"Canada's Craziest Mayor.\\" Invited to gay pride parades repeatedly over his tenure as mayor, he refused every time, despite being known as a mayor who attended every event he could. The absence of support for the city's LGBTQ community led to accusations that he is homophobic. After the 2016 election, Atchison has worked as a consultant for Canwest Commercial and Land Corporation. Atchison was appointed to the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2019.https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/six-visionaries-honoured- with-2019-saskatchewan-order-of-merit/wcm/599b4cc9-abeb-4653-80cb-9a2619eab10d Personal life Atchison was born and raised in Saskatoon where he attended Queen Elizabeth and Holliston elementary schools, Walter Murray Collegiate and the University of Saskatchewan. He has participated in curling, tennis, Canadian football, golf and hockey as both a player and a coach. Atchison is also a member of the Saskatchewan Grand Lodge of Freemasons.

Prime lenses have large apertures, compared with zoom lenses. These 85 mm lenses have maximum apertures of (left) and (right). In film and photography, a prime lens is a fixed focal length photographic lens (as opposed to a zoom lens), typically with a maximum aperture from f2.8 to f1.2. The term can also mean the primary lens in a combination lens system. Confusion between these two meanings can occur if context doesn't make the interpretation clear. People sometimes use alternate terms—primary focal length, fixed focal length, or FFL to avoid ambiguity.  As alternative to zoom lens  The term prime has come to mean the opposite of zoom—a fixed-focal-length, or unifocal lens. While a prime lens of a given focal length is less versatile than a zoom lens, it is often of superior optical quality, wider maximum aperture, lighter weight, and smaller size. These advantages stem from having fewer moving parts, optical elements optimized for one particular focal length, and a less complicated lens formula that creates fewer optical aberration issues. Larger maximum aperture (smaller f-number) facilitates photography in lower light, and a shallower depth of field. A normal lens or \\"normal prime\\" is a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format, or that reproduces perspective that generally looks \\"natural\\" to a human observer under normal viewing conditions.  Traditional meaning as primary lens  An alternative and older meaning of prime lens is the main lens in a combination lens system. When the camera lens is used with some other optical device, such as a close-up lens, teleconverter, or teleside converter, the camera lens itself is properly called the prime lens. Prime is here used in the sense of primary, chief, original, first in order, etc. Lens manufacturers such as ARRI Media, ISCO Precision Optics, Schneider, Carl Zeiss AG, Canon and others still make variable focal length cine and video lenses regularly catalogued as variable prime lenses. A variable prime is sometimes distinguished from a \\"true zoom\\" in that the latter maintains focus as the focal length is varied. This use of the term \\"prime lens\\" is an example of a retronym. Early in photography only primary camera lenses were available, and were merely called \\"lenses\\" or \\"objectives\\". Later, \\"auxiliary\\" lenses were available, which usually fit in front of the front element of the primary, or \\"prime\\" lens.  Popular focal lengths  Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II. Many lens manufacturers produce or produced prime lenses at or near the following focal lengths: 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 40mm, 50mm, 85mm, 105mm, 135mm, 200mm, 300mm, 400mm, and 600mm. For these lengths many manufacturers produce two or more lenses with the same focal length but with different maximum apertures to suit the different needs of photographers. Additional focal lengths can be created by using a teleconverter. For 35 mm film and full frame digital cameras (in which the image area is 36 by 24 millimeters) prime lenses can be categorized by focal length as follows: * 12 to 21 mm: Ultra-Wide — usually used at very close subject distances to produce a perspective that provides a dramatic, often extreme image that distorts a scene’s natural proportions * 24 to 35 mm: Wide — capture a wider field of view than a standard lens, at shorter distances, the perspective can show distortion * 50 mm: Standard — a focal length near the 44mm image diagonal and a perspective similar to human vision * 85 mm: Portrait — short telephoto lens that accommodates a longer subject to camera distance for pleasing perspective effects and useful image framing * 135 mm: Telephoto — used, for example, by action and sports photographers to capture faraway objects * 200 to 500 mm: Super Telephoto — specialized, bulky lenses typically used in sports, action, and wildlife photography  Specialist lenses  Some specialist lenses are only available as prime lenses due to design or cost constraints. Examples of such specialist lenses are: extreme telephoto or wide angle, lenses with tilt and / or shift function, lenses with large apertures and macro lenses.

It emerged as the major free festival in the calendar after the violent suppression of the Windsor Free Festival in August 1974, with Wally Hope providing the impetus for its founding, and was itself violently suppressed in 1985 in the Battle of the Beanfield, with no free festival held at Stonehenge since although people have been allowed to gather at the stones again for the solstice since 1999. By the 1980s, the festival had grown to be a major event, attracting up to 30,000 people in 1984.History of the Stonehenge Free Festival :1972-1985. The festival attendees were viewed as hippies by the wider British public . This, along with the open drug use and sale, contributed to the increase in restrictions on access to Stonehenge, and fences were erected around the stones in 1977. The same year, police resurrected a moribund law against driving over grassland in order to levy fines against festival goers in motorised transport. By 1984 police-festival relations were relaxed with only a nominal police presence required. Bands The festival was a celebration of various alternative cultures. The Tibetan Ukrainian Mountain Troupe, The Tepee People, Circus Normal, the Peace Convoy, New Age Travellers and the Wallys were notable counterculture attendees. The stage hosted many bands including Hawkwind, Gong, Doctor and the Medics, Flux of Pink Indians, Buster Blood Vessel, Omega Tribe, Crass, The Damned, Killing Joke, The Selecter, Dexys Midnight Runners, Thompson Twins, Bronz, The Raincoats, The 101ers with Joe Strummer, Jeremy Spencer & the Children of God, Brent Black Music Co-op, Killerhertz, Mournblade, Amazulu, Wishbone Ash, Man, Benjamin Zephaniah, Inner City Unit, Here and Now, Cardiacs, The Enid, Roy Harper, Jimmy Page, Ted Chippington, Zorch and Ozric Tentacles, Vince pie and the crumbs, which all played for free.

BMX vert jump Vert is a term used in extreme sports especially vert skating, vert skateboarding, snowboarding and BMX to denote a competition held on a vert ramp which allows the competitors to fly into the air and land back on the ramp. This time in the air allows the competitor to perform moves which would otherwise be extremely difficult. An example of this would be a flip, or a spin. The term itself comes from the word \\"vertical,\\" the direction in which the competitor is moving after leaving the ramp. Ramps used in these events are usually vert ramps. Outside of competitions, the term vert is not normally used. Instead, the specific type of ramp is denoted. So instead of saying \\"I am going to go ride vert,\\" one might say \\"I am going to go ride a half-pipe.\\" However, it would be correct to say \\"in competitions, I usually ride vert,\\" in order to differentiate from other forms of competition (such as freestyle, park or street).

The police were enforcing a High Court injunction obtained by the authorities prohibiting the 1985 festival from taking place. Around 1,300 police officers took part in the operation against approximately 600 travellers. The convoy of travellers heading for Stonehenge encountered resistance at a police road block seven miles from the landmark. Police claim that some traveller vehicles then rammed police vehicles in an attempt to push through the roadblock. Around the same time police smashed the windows of the convoy's vehicles and some travellers were arrested. The rest broke into an adjacent field and a stand-off consequently developed that persisted for several hours. According to the BBC \\"Police said they came under attack, being pelted with lumps of wood, stones and even petrol bombs\\". Conversely, The Observer states the travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting so \\"was false\\". Eventually the police launched another attack during which the worst of the violence is purported to have taken place. According to The Observer, during this period pregnant women and those holding babies were clubbed by police with truncheons and the police were hitting \\"anybody they could reach\\". When some of the travellers tried to escape by driving away through the fields, The Observer states that the police threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them in an attempt to stop them. Dozens of travellers were injured, 537 travellers were eventually arrested. This represents one of the largest mass arrest of civilians since at least the Second World War, possibly one of the biggest in English legal history.

The free festival scene thus also emerged in the 1970s. The People's Free Festival at Windsor ran from 1972 until 1974 when it was violently aborted by the authorities. Stonehenge Free Festival began in 1974. In 1975 the Windsor festival switched to Watchfield but did not prove successful at the abandoned military site. Consequently, The People's Free Festival at Stonehenge, became the focal point of the movement. In 1980, the Festival was marred by significant violence, largely by biker groups. In 1984 the Department of the Environment passed management of Stonehenge and the surrounding land to English Heritage. By that time the festival had grown in size, the attendance figure for the 1984 festival was estimated at 100,000. Due to the high attendance figures there was little authority present at Stonehenge festivals and the police were unable to shut them down or implement the law. Consequently, most illegal drugs were unrestrictedly available and advertised for purchase. Traders at the festival were neglecting to obtain licences or pay taxes. Critics claimed that the 1984 festival had resulted in the destruction of archaeological information and on the site itself, \\"holes had been dug in Bronze Age barrows for latrines and as bread ovens, motorcycles had been ridden over them, churning the surface. Fences had been torn down, and a thousand young trees cut down for firewood\\". The clean-up cost upwards of £20,000, besides the archaeological information that was lost. Landowners also claimed that damage to Stonehenge, other property damage, trespassing, recreational drug use and bathing naked in rivers had occurred during the festival. A civil high court injunction was consequently imposed prohibiting the proposed 1985 festival from taking place. Main events After staying the previous night in Savernake Forest, the Convoy on the morning of 1 June numbered up to 140 vehicles, most of them buses and vans converted into living spaces; it is estimated they contained 600 people. The police had laid down an exclusion zone 4 miles (6.4 km) around the perimeter of Stonehenge, which the convoy hoped to breach. The Convoy met resistance when the police set up a roadblock near Shipton Bellinger about 7 miles (11 km) from Stonehenge. This was achieved by tipping three lorry loads of gravel across the road. According to The Observer, the convoy evaded the main roadblock on the A303 by slipping down a side road but were then met with a second roadblock. At this juncture the police claim that some traveller vehicles rammed police vehicles in an attempt to escape the roadblock.Ed. Andy Worthington, 2005, The Battle of the Beanfield, Enabler Publications, At around the same time the police smashed the windscreens of traveller vehicles and arrested occupants. Most traveller vehicles broke into an adjacent field, by driving through a hedgerow according to one source. A stand-off consequently ensued. Travellers made attempts to negotiate with police but the officer in charge, Assistant Chief Constable Lionel Grundy, ordered that all travellers be arrested. There were outbreaks of violence during which several members of the Convoy received head injuries. An ambulance was allowed through to take them to hospital. Police Officer Bernie Lund, who was on scene, claimed that during the stand-off, petrol bombs and sticks were thrown at officers. However The Guardian states that travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting that they were \\"was false\\". At 7pm officers in riot gear entered the field and launched a final attack. Pregnant women and those holding babies were hit by police with truncheons according to The Observer, who also noted journalist Nick Davies stating that police were hitting \\"anybody (that) they could reach\\". When some travellers tried to escape by driving away through the field police allegedly threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them to stop them. The Observer and The Independent report that travellers' vehicles were smashed and set on fire. One traveller was taken away with a suspected fractured skull. The large majority of the travellers, over 500, were arrested on suspicion of obstructing police and obstructing the highway. One source states that this represented the largest mass arrest of civilians in English legal history, another that it was the biggest figure since the Second World War. There were insufficient holding cells in local jails to hold all those arrested. Convoy members were transported throughout the Midlands and even to northern England. Not all children and parents ended up in the same region. Most of the arrests did not result in successful prosecutions. Traveller Alan Lodge, speaking to the BBC, described it as \\"an ambush that happened on a small, mild mannered bunch of people\\". The UK miners' strike had ended earlier in the same year, and police compared this event with tactics used at the Battle of the Beanfield, stating: \\"The Police operation had been planned for several months and lessons in rapid deployment learned from the miners' strike were implemented.\\" Witnesses Most independent eyewitness accounts of the events relate that the police used violent tactics against men, women and children, including pregnant women; and purposely damaged the vehicles used by the convoy.The Battle of the Beanfield, Edited by Andy Worthington Accessed 22 January 2008. =Earl of Cardigan= The travellers had departed from Savernake Forest, which is owned by the Earl of Cardigan's family. The Earl of Cardigan decided to follow the convoy on his motorbike. The Earl describes that during the initial confrontation there were negotiations with police who insisted that the travellers would not be allowed to pass. The travellers subsequently began entering into a field. Then \\"Police rushed out on foot, from behind their barricades. Clutching drawn truncheons and riot shields, they ran round to the driver's door of each vehicle, slamming their truncheons into the bodywork to make a deafening noise, and shouting at every driver, 'get out, get out, hand over your keys, get out'\\". He states that police \\"smashing up vehicles\\" and instructions to \\"Get out!\\" often happened simultaneously, giving travellers no time to react before police used riot sticks to break the vehicles' windscreens. Cardigan described seeing a very pregnant woman being \\"repeatedly clubbed on the head\\" by police, many of whom had their ID numbers covered up. He also saw Police with hammers smashing up the dashboards of several of the now-abandoned motor-coach homes. Cardigan also described how he was approached by the police the following day, who wanted permission to remove travellers who were still at Savernake: \\"They said they wanted to go into the campsite 'suitably equipped' and 'finish unfinished business'. Make of that phrase what you will. I said to them, that if it was my permission they were after, they did not have it. I did not want a repeat of the grotesque events that I'd seen the day before.\\" =Journalists= ITN Reporter Kim Sabido was at the scene and recorded a piece-to-camera in which he claimed that he had witnessed \\"some of the most brutal police treatment of people\\" that he had seen in his entire career as a journalist. He also remarked on the number of people that had been \\"clubbed\\" by police including those \\"holding babies in their arms\\". He felt that an inquiry should be held into what had happened. Sabido later claimed that when he went back to the ITN library to look at the rushes, most of the footage had \\"disappeared, particularly some of the nastier shots.\\"Operation Solstice (1991), documentary first broadcast on Channel 4 in Nov 1991 Some of this missing footage was later rediscovered and incorporated into Operation Solstice a documentary shown on Channel 4 in 1991. Nick Davies reported for the Observer that \\"There was glass breaking, people screaming, black smoke towering out of burning caravans and everywhere there seemed to be people being bashed and flattened and pulled by the hair. Men, women and children were led away, shivering, swearing, crying, bleeding, leaving their homes in pieces.\\" Freelance photographer Ben Gibson, engaged by The Observer that day, was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer. He was later acquitted. Another freelance photographer, Tim Malyon, had to flee at one point. Legal action Twenty-four of the travellers sued Wiltshire Police for wrongful arrest, assault and criminal damage to themselves and their property. Six years after the event a verdict was reached. Twenty-one of the travellers were successful in their case and were awarded £24,000 in damages towards their false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest. The judge declined to award their legal costs and their compensation consequently went towards paying for this. Their barrister, Lord Gifford QC, stated \\"It left a very sour taste in the mouth.\\" In court, individual police officers were difficult to identify, as they had hidden their identification numbers on the day. Despite this, one police sergeant was convicted of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a member of the Convoy. Police radio and video was used as evidence during the court case, however there was a recording gap in both the radio and video recordings. The recording gap in the video footage was allegedly due to the video tape breaking when the convoy was initially halted at the roadblock. There was also evidence that radio logs of conversations between officers on the day of the battle had been altered. The Earl of Cardigan testified in court against Wiltshire Police. His testimony proved vital in supporting the allegation that Police violence had been excessive. He was criticised by several national newspapers for acting as a witness against Wiltshire Police; Bill Deedes' editorial in The Daily Telegraph claimed he was a class traitor. Consequently, the Earl successfully sued for defamation. Aftermath and legacy Legislation was introduced in the form of the Public Order Act 1986 and later the Criminal Justice Act 1994 that made the travellers' way of life increasingly difficult to sustain. Following the events of 1985, the four-mile blockade of Stonehenge was maintained for future summer solstices. Consequently, conflict between police and those trying to reach Stonehenge continued to take place every year. Neo- druid leader Arthur Uther Pendragon was arrested on each and every summer solstice between 1985 and 1999 whilst trying to access Stonehenge. In the summer of 1988 around 130 people were arrested and in 1989 that figure rose to 260. For the 1999 summer solstice English Heritage granted \\"limited access\\" to Stonehenge to neo-druids. This access permission was later rescinded when 200 New Age travellers broke on to the site. Twenty people were arrested. Despite repeated calls, an inquiry into the events of 1 June 1985 has never been honoured. Cultural references Singer Roy Harper's song \\"Back to the Stones\\" refers to the Battle of the Beanfield. It was recorded in 1989 and appears on his 1993 live album Unhinged. The Hawkwind song \\"Confrontation\\" from the album Out & Intake includes a description of the day's events and includes a dramatisation of some events including the repeated phrase \\"I am not interested in anything you have to say\\". The Levellers' song \\"Battle of the Beanfield\\", from their 1991 album Levelling the Land, was inspired by the Battle of the Beanfield. British progressive-rock band Solstice wrote a song which comments on the Battle. \\"Circles\\" is found on their 1997 album of the same name, and includes what sounds like reporting from the battle, with Kim Sabido's voice-over. The song \\"Itinerant Child\\", by Ian Dury and Chaz Jankel, which appears on the 1998 album Mr. Love Pants, by Ian Dury & The Blockheads, was inspired by Dury's experiences during the incident.Birch, W. Ian Dury: The Definitive Biography (2011), London: Pan Books, , p.329. The police riot is a feature of the 2001 fictional novel He Kills Coppers by Jake Arnott, partially following changes in police culture between the 1960s and the 1980s, later made into an ITV TV series. The confrontation is also featured in the 2018 novel The Fountain in the Forest by Tony White.

They include the European common glow-worm and other members of the Lampyridae, but bioluminescence also occurs in the families Elateridae, Phengodidae, and Rhagophthalmidae among beetles; as well as members of the genera Arachnocampa, Keroplatus, and Orfelia among keroplatid fungus gnats. Beetles Four families of beetles are bioluminescent. The wingless larviform females and larvae of these bioluminescent species are usually known as \\"glowworms\\". Winged males may or may not also exhibit bioluminescence. Their light may be emitted as flashes or as a constant glow, and usually range in color from green, yellow, to orange. The families are closely related, and are all members of the beetle superfamily, Elateroidea. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated that bioluminescence may have a single evolutionary origin among the families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, and Rhagophthalmidae; but is likely to have arisen independently among Elateridae. * Family Elateridae - The click beetles. Of the estimated 10,000 species classified under this family, around 200 species from tropical regions of the Americas and some Melanesian islands are bioluminescent. All of them are members of the subfamily Pyrophorinae, except for one species, Campyloxenus pyrothorax, which belongs to subfamily Campyloxeninae, and Balgus schnusei, in Thylacosterninae.Costa, C. (1984) Note on the bioluminescence of Balgus schnusei (Heller, 1914) (Trixagidae, Coleoptera). Revista Brasileira de Entomologia 28: 397–398. * Family Lampyridae - True fireflies. Contains around 2,000 species found throughout the world. Some \\"glow worms\\" are in this family.http://animals.net/glow-worm/ Retrieved on 19 Jul 18 * Family Phengodidae - Usually known as glowworm beetles. Contains around 230 species endemic to the New World. This family also includes railroad worms, which are unique among all terrestrial bioluminescent organisms in producing red light. * Family Rhagophthalmidae - Contains around 30 species found in Asia. The validity of this family has not been fully resolved. Rhagophthalmidae was formerly considered to be a subfamily under Phengodidae before being treated as a distinct family. Some authors [who?] now believe that it should be classified under Lampyridae. Fungus gnats Three genera of fungus gnats are bioluminescent, and known as \\"glowworms\\" in their larval stage. They produce a blue-green light. The larvae spin sticky webs to catch food. They are found in caves, overhangs, rock cavities, and other sheltered, wet areas. They are usually classified under the family Keroplatidae, but this is not universally accepted and some authors place them under Mycetophilidae instead. Despite the similarities in function and appearance, the bioluminescent systems of the three genera are not homologous and are believed to have evolved separately. * Genus Arachnocampa - around five species found only in New Zealand and Australia. The most well- known member of the genus is the New Zealand glowworm, Arachnocampa luminosa. The larvae are predatory and use their lights to lure prey into their webs. * Genus Orfelia - sometimes known as \\"dismalites\\". Contains a single species, Orfelia fultoni, found only in North America. Like Arachnocampa spp., their larvae may use their lights to attract prey like springtails and other small insects, but their main food is fungal spores. * Genus Keroplatus, - found in Eurasia. Unlike Arachnocampa and Orfelia, the larvae of Keroplatus feed only on fungal spores. Their bioluminescence is believed to have no function and is vestigial.

White was born into a family that had established its homestead at the junction of the Muskrat and Ottawa Rivers where the town of Pembroke, Ontario was soon established. His family established several businesses including a lumberyard, general store and blacksmith's shop. As a young man, White and his brother took over the family business and became wealthy as they supplied the steam engine industries. He also became a major shareholder and president of the Pembroke Company. White entered politics and became reeve of Pembroke Township in 1870. He first ran for the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative candidate in the 1872 federal election in the riding of Renfrew North but was defeated. He won election in the 1874 election, but his victory was overturned by the courts, and he lost the subsequent by-election that was held later that year. He was elected in a subsequent 1876 by-election, again won election in the 1878 election, and sat in the House of Commons of Canada for the next twenty years. A supporter of Sir John A. Macdonald, White was a believer in the National Policy. Following the 1891 election, Macdonald nominated White to be Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. Macdonald died soon after, and White presided over a tumultuous period in the House of Commons as a succession of Conservative Prime Ministers attempted to hold the party and government together in the absence of the party's long time leader. Debates over the Manitoba Schools Question were particularly divisive, and brought down the government of Sir Mackenzie Bowell. White opposed the government's policy that favoured Catholic education rights as he believed that it interfered with the provincial government's right to set education policy, but, as Speaker, remained silent on the issue until the 1896 election campaign. Despite his independence on the issue, White lost his seat in the election and failed in several attempts to return to the House until the 1904 election when he finally regained a seat. By this time, he was in declining health, and was unable to regularly attend House sittings. He died in office in 1906.

An atheist, communist, and art activist, Counihan made art in response to the politics and social hardships of his times. He is regarded as one of Australia's major artists of the 20th Century. Early life Counihan was born on 4 October 1913 in Albert Park, then a working-class suburb of Melbourne. He attended the St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne Choir school (closed in 1929), then Caulfield Grammar School in 1928. He studied part-time under Charles Wheeler at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne during 1930–31, where he met the social realists Herbert McClintock and Roy Dalgarno. Career Social realism, the belief that art should reflect the realities of society under capitalism, was the artistic doctrine of the Communist Party of Australia, and in 1931 Counihan became a confirmed atheist and a member of the Party. He helped found the Workers Art Guild, and began printmaking, producing linocuts and lithographs for Communist magazine covers and pamphlets as well as designing banners. During the Great Depression Counihan participated in the \\"free speech\\" fights in Brunswick, organised by the Communist Party in response to a Victorian state government law banning \\"subversive\\" gatherings. Dozens of members of the Unemployed Workers Movement were arrested, and unemployed meetings at the intersection of Phoenix Street and Sydney Road, Brunswick were dispersed by police. As part of this fight, a young Counihan addressed a crowd from a locked cage on top a truck. Police had to cut him out, to the jeers of the crowd, as he continued speaking. From 1934 Counihan worked as a cartoonist for various publications, including The Bulletin and the Communist Party's paper, the Guardian from 1945 to 1949 and again from 1952 to 1958. He spent extended periods in hospital with tuberculosis during the Second World War. With the encouragement of the artist Yosl Bergner, he began to paint. He developed a personal style based on the social realist approach, producing compassionate images of workers and their working lives. Counihan maintained that the artist had a duty to \\"gather information from the political developments of the time.\\" His 1955 painting On Parliament Steps won the George Crouch Memorial Prize in 1956.Bronwyn Watson, The Weekend Australian, 4–5 May 2013, Review, p. 11 Counihan remained loyal to the Communist Party during its various splits and despite its declining support in the 1970s and 1980s. His 1973 posthumous portrait of Hugh Gemmell Lamb-Smith – who had taught Counihan at Caulfield Grammar and, as well, had encouraged his artistic endeavours whilst he was there – largely painted from memory, and commissioned by the Caulfield Grammarians' Association, is on permanent display within the school's \\"Cripps Centre\\" on its Caulfield Campus.Smith, R. (1981), p.33; and Smith, B. (1993), p.45. In 1979, Counihan contributed the entry on footballer Roy Cazaly to Volume 7 of the Australian Dictionary of Biography.Counihan, Noel. Cazaly, Roy (1893–1963), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University. Retrieved 15 July 2012. Death On 5 July 1986, Counihan died in Melbourne aged 72. Legacy The Counihan Gallery, managed by City of Moreland Council, is named in his honour. To mark its tenth anniversary, Edwina Bartlem curated an exhibition in which contemporary artists created works inspired by the art and ideas of Counihan. The artists included George Gittoes and Angela Cavalieri. A short distance away from the Gallery, outside the Brunswick Mechanics Institute on Sydney Road, a Free Speech memorial has been built by artist Simon Perry to commemorate the free speech fights by the unemployed in 1933 and Noel Counihan's part in them.

Biography Reinecke was born in what is today Hamburg, Germany province of Altona; technically he was born a Dane, as until 1864 the town was under Danish rule. He received all his musical instruction from his father, (Johann Peter) Rudolf Reinecke (22 November 1795 – 14 August 1883), a music teacher and writer on musical subjects. Carl first devoted himself to violin- playing, but later on turned his attention to the piano. He began to compose at the age of seven, and his first public appearance as a pianist was when he was twelve years old. At the age of 19, he undertook his first concert tour as a pianist in 1843, through Denmark and Sweden, after which he lived for a long time in Leipzig, where he studied under Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt; he entered into friendly relations with the former two. After the stay in Leipzig, Reinecke went on tour with Königslöw and Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski (later Schumann's biographer), in North Germany and Denmark. In 1846, Reinecke was appointed Court Pianist for Christian VIII in Copenhagen. There he remained until 1848, when he resigned and went to Paris. Overall he wrote four concertos for his instrument (and many cadenzas for others' works, including a large set published as his Opus 87), as well as concertos for violin, cello, harp and flute. In the winter of 1850/51, Carl Schurz reports attending weekly “musical evenings” in Paris where Reinecke was in attendance. Schurz reports “We had every week a ‘musical evening’; sometimes in my room, in which young musicians — among them Reinecke, who afterwards became the famous director of the well-known ‘Gewandhaus Concerts’ in Leipzig — reviewed the most recent composers, and now and then produced their own compositions, while I and others served as an enthusiastic public.” In 1851, Reinecke became a professor at the Cologne Conservatory. In ensuing years he was appointed musical director at the German metropolis of Barmen, and became the academic, musical director and conductor of the Singakademie at Breslau. In 1860, Reinecke was appointed director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra concerts in Leipzig, and professor of composition and piano at the Conservatorium. He led the orchestra for more than three decades, until 1895. He conducted premieres such as the full seven-movement version of Brahms's A German Requiem (1869). In 1865 the Gewandhaus-Quartett premiered his piano quintet, and in 1892 his D major string quartet. Reinecke is best known for his flute sonata \\"Undine\\", but he is also remembered as one of the most influential and versatile musicians of his time. He served as a teacher for 35 years, until his retirement in 1902. His students included Edvard Grieg, Basil Harwood, Elisabeth Wintzer, Charles Villiers Stanford, Christian Sinding, Leoš Janáček, Constanta Erbiceanu, Isaac Albéniz, August Max Fiedler, Walter Niemann, Johan Svendsen, Richard Franck, Felix Weingartner, Max Bruch, Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis, Ernest Hutcheson, Felix Fox, August Winding and many others. After retirement from the conservatory, Reinecke devoted his time to composition, resulting in almost three hundred published works. He wrote several operas (none of which are performed today) including König Manfred. During this time, he frequently made concert tours to England and elsewhere. His piano playing belonged to a school in which grace and neatness were characteristic, and at one time he was probably unrivaled as a Mozart player and an accompanist. In 1904 at the age of 80, he made recordings of seven works playing on piano roll for the Welte-Mignon company, making him the earliest-born pianist to have his playing preserved in any format.

Berg's group, founded in 1968 among the counterculture youth in Southern California, gained notoriety for incorporating sexuality into its spiritual message and recruitment methods. Berg and his organization have subsequently been accused of a broad range of sexual misconduct, including child sexual abuse. Life =Early years (1919–1969)= Berg was born in Oakland, California, the youngest of three children of Hjalmer Emmanuel Berg and Rev. Virginia Lee Brandt, Christian evangelists. His father was Swedish. His maternal grandfather was Rev. John Lincoln Brandt (1860–1946), a Disciples of Christ minister, author, and lecturer of Muskogee, Oklahoma. David Berg graduated from Monterey High School in 1935 and later attended Elliott School of Business Administration. Berg often said that his rich heritage played a key role in shaping his character and religious convictions. Many of his forefathers, as well as both of his parents, were deeply committed Christians. Some of them were members of the Dunkards, a conservative offshoot of the Church of the Brethren. State persecution of the sect drove the Brandt family from Germany to America, where they settled in Pennsylvania and Ohio around 1750. John Lincoln Brandt, Berg's grandfather, had a dramatic conversion in his mid-twenties and immediately entered full-time Christian service. For years he was a Methodist circuit rider. He later became a leader of the Alexander Campbell movement of the Disciples of Christ, a restoration movement that developed into the current Protestant denomination Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Virginia Brandt Berg, David Berg's mother, is the individual whom he credited for influencing him the most. Although raised in a Christian home, Virginia became an atheist and wild society girl during her college years. However, shortly after the birth of her first child, she broke her back in an accident and spent the next five years as a bedridden invalid, often hovering near death. Eventually she recovered and spent the rest of her life with her husband, Hjalmer, in active Christian service as a pastor and evangelist. Virginia and Hjalmer were no strangers to controversy. They were expelled from the Disciples of Christ after publicly testifying of her \\"divine healing\\", which was contrary to church doctrine. They subsequently joined a new denomination, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, shortly before David Berg's birth. In later years, their missionary zeal and disdain for denominational politicking often set them at variance with the conservative faction of that church's hierarchy, causing them to work largely as independent pastors and evangelists. David Berg spent his early years traveling with his parents, who pursued their evangelical mission with a passion. In 1924, they settled in Miami, Florida, after Virginia successfully led a series of large revivals at the Miami Gospel Tabernacle. This became Berg's home for the next 14 years, while his mother and father were pastors at a number of Miami churches. As is the case with many pastors and their dependents, the Berg family depended entirely on the generosity of their parishioners for their support, and often had difficulty making ends meet. This instilled in Berg a lifelong habit of frugality, which he encouraged his followers to adopt. In the late 1930s, Virginia Berg returned to her favorite ministry, that of a traveling evangelist. David Berg accompanied her, and for most of the next 10 years acted as her chauffeur, song leader, and general assistant. Like his father, Berg became a minister in the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and was placed at Valley Farms, Arizona. Berg was eventually expelled from the organization for differences in teachings and for alleged sexual misconduct with a church employee. In Berg's writings he claimed the expulsion was due to his support for greater racial diversity among his congregation. Fred Jordan, Berg's friend and boss, allowed Berg and his personal family to open and run a branch of his Soul Clinic in Miami, Florida as a missionary training school. After running into trouble with local authorities for his aggressive disapproval with evolution being taught as fact in public schools, Berg moved his family to Fred Jordan's Texas Soul Clinic, in Western Texas. =The Children of God/The Family (1968–1994)= David Berg founded the organization known as the Teens for Christ in Huntington Beach, California in 1968. It was later known as \\"The Children of God,\\" \\"The Family of Love\\" or \\"The Family,\\" and is currently \\"The Family International\\". Berg called on his followers to devote their full-time to spreading the message of Jesus' love and salvation as far and wide as possible, unfettered by convention or tradition, and to teach others to do the same. Berg also decried the de-Christianization and decay of moral values in Western society. He viewed the trend towards a New World Order as setting the stage for the rise of the Antichrist. Berg lived in seclusion, communicating with his followers and the public via nearly 3,000 \\"Mo Letters\\"xFamily.org Publications Database -- contains many of the \\"Mo Letters\\" written by David Berg (\\"Mo\\" from his pseudonym \\"Moses David\\") that he wrote on a wide variety of subjects. These typically covered spiritual or practical subjects and were used as a way of disseminating and introducing policy and religious doctrine to his followers. His writings were often extreme and uncompromising in their denunciation of what he believed to be evil, such as mainstream churches, pedophilia laws, capitalism, and Jews, yet he always admonished the reader to \\"love the sinner but hate the sin\\". He espoused doctrines that mainstream Christians denounce as heretical. However, his followers argue that his writings are permeated with a love of God. =Death= Berg died in 1994 in Portugal and was buried in Costa de Caparica there. His remains have since been cremated. Controversy David Berg has been accused of leading a cult which promoted assaults on children and sexual abuse of women and children for decades. Former members have told their stories in widely disseminated media reports, though official inquiries at the time found no evidence of child abuse. Berg was also personally accused of pedophilia. He recalled in his letters how he was taught to masturbate in church by another boy his age. When his mother caught him, he was forced to masturbate in front of his father. Oftentimes Berg would explicitly describe his sexual preferences and recalled that one thing he regretted was that he never slept with his mother.Berg and Anti- Semitism on xFamily.org In a child custody case in the United Kingdom Berg's granddaughter, Merry Berg, testified that Berg sexually molested her when she was a young teenager. Another of Berg's granddaughters, Joyanne Treadwell Berg, spoke on American television about being sexually abused by David Berg. Berg's adopted son, Ricky Rodriguez, wrote an article on the web site MovingOn.org in which he describes Berg's sexual activity involving a number of women and children. Davida Kelley, the daughter of Rodriguez's nanny, Sarah Kelley, accused Berg of molesting her in a June 2005 Rolling Stone article. In the same article, a woman identified as Armendria alleged that David Berg sexually abused her when she was 13 years old. His distant Jewish ancestry notwithstanding—in 1745, one of his mother's forebears, Jewish by birth but a Christian convert, moved to the American colonies and lived as a Mennonite—David Berg was outspokenly anti-Semitic, believing that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, as well as all persecution of Christians in the world. In support of his views of an international Jewish conspiracy, he cited the forged Protocols of the Elders of Zion, but disclaimed the label \\"anti-Semitic\\". Berg predicted several apocalyptic events that did not occur. His best-known prediction was that the comet Kohoutek (1974) would wreak havoc and possible destruction. This prediction was shared by others outside The Family, such as Joseph F. Goodavage in the January 1974 issue of SAGA magazine. He also predicted that California would imminently fall into the ocean, the Great Tribulation would begin in 1989, and the Second Coming of Jesus would happen in 1993. Berg lived in seclusion and apart from the main body of his followers. Due to his obsession with secrecy, until his death, any photos of him appearing in the group's publications had his face covered with pencil drawings, often depicting him as an anthropomorphic lion. Personal family Berg married his first wife, Jane Miller (known as \\"Mother Eve\\" in the Children of God), on July 22, 1944 in Glendale, California. They had four children together: Linda (known as \\"Deborah\\" in the Children of God); Paul, d. April 1973 (known as \\"Aaron\\" in the Children of God); Jonathan Emanuel (known as \\"Hosea\\" in the Children of God); and Faith. Berg also informally adopted Ricky Rodriguez, the son of his second wife (and present leader of The Family) Karen Zerby. In the 1970s and 1980s, sexually suggestive photographic depictions of Rodriguez (aka \\"Davidito\\") with adult caretakers were disseminated throughout the group by Berg and Zerby in a childrearing handbook known as The Story of Davidito.Story of Davidito on xFamily.org In January 2005, Ricky Rodriguez murdered one of the female caretakers shown in the handbook before taking his own life several hours later.

This species evolved about 150 years ago through a sympatric shift from the native host hawthorn to the domesticated apple species Malus domestica in the northeastern United States. This fly is believed to have been accidentally spread to the western United States from the endemic eastern United States region through contaminated apples at multiple points throughout the 20th century. The apple maggot uses Batesian mimicry as a method of defense, with coloration resembling that of the forelegs and pedipalps of a jumping spider (family Salticidae). The adult form of this insect is about long, slightly smaller than a housefly. The larva, which is the stage of this insect's lifecycle that causes the actual damage to the fruit, is similar to a typical fly larva or maggot. Caterpillars, especially the larvae of the codling moth, that infest the insides of apples are often confused with the apple maggot. However, these organisms generally feed in the apple's core while apple maggots feed on the fruit flesh. The apple maggot larvae are often difficult to detect in infested fruit due to their pale, cream color and small body size. The adult fly lays its eggs inside the fruit. Larvae consume the fruit and cause it to bruise, decay, and finally drop before ripening. The insect overwinters as a pupa in the soil. It only emerges after metamorphosis into a relatively defenseless fly. Adults emerge from late June through September, with their peak flight times occurring in August. Description USDA. A: Female fly B: Eggs removed from apple C: Egg punctures in skin of apple D: Eggs in normal position in apple E: Larva, nearly fully grown F: Pupae. Eggs are fusiform and pearly white when laid in fruit, but after a short period of time in the fruit, they turn a cream color. Developing larvae can be clearly seen within the translucent eggs. The larva is white or cream-colored, but if it eats green pulp near the fruit skin, the green shows through the skin. Larvae range in length from 7 to 8.5 mm and in width from 1.75 to 2 mm. The pupa is formed inside the larval skin, after the maggot shortens and becomes inactive. During the pupal stage, the larva is initially light yellow, but turns yellow-brown within hours and darkens progressively. The pupae range in length from 4 to 5 mm and in width from 2 to 2.5 mm and are an elongated oval shape. Adult female R. pomonella are shiny black with white markings and an average length of 6.25 mm. Their wingspan averages 12 mm. They have green eyes and a white stripe on each side of the thorax. The abdomen is shiny black with four uniform white bands. When the ovipositor is not in use, it is retracted completely into the abdomen. The ovipositor is horn-like, hard, and chitinous. Male R. pomonella have a similar appearance to the females but are smaller with an average length of 4–5 mm; the size of the abdomen is the main difference, with only five of the seven segments visible (the sixth and seventh are retracted under the fifth). The sixth and seventh segments contain a chitinous framework that support a long, spiraling (when coiled) chitinous penis, which is terminated by a spiral brush with numerous stiff hairs. Distribution and habitat R. pomonella is prevalent in North America, though endemic only to the eastern United States. The range of the apple race is contained within that of the hawthorn race, including the northeastern and midwestern US as well as eastern Canada. The species has been found as far south as Florida. In 1979, the apple maggot was reported to be found for the first time on a backyard tree in Portland, Oregon.AliNiazee. M.T. and R.L. Penrose. 1981. Apple maggot in Oregon : A possible threat to the Northwest apple industry. Bull. Entomol. Soc . Amer. 27 :245-246. California quarantine inspection records show apple maggot infest fruit have been intercepted at border patrol stations since around 1950. A misidentified apple maggot, originally thought to be the snowberry maggot Rhagoletis zephyria Snow, was found in the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) tephritid fly collection, and the fly was collected in 1951 in Rowena, Oregon.AliNiazee. M.T. 1986. Managing the apple maggot. Rhagoletis pomella in the Pacific Northwest : An evaluation of possible options. Proc. 10 BC/WPRS Symp. on \\"Fruit Flies of Economic Importance.\\" Hamburg. West Germany. 1984. Pp. 175-182. The ODA conducted a survey in 1980 to measure the distribution of the apple maggot, and traps in southwestern Washington showed apple maggot distribution in and around Vancouver, Washington, a suburb of Portland, Oregon. The apple maggot has spread to the Northwest, including Washington, Oregon, and northern California. They are believed to have been spread through contaminated apples, most likely to have been accidentally introduced to the western United States multiple times over the past few decades. This theory is supported by lack of R. pomonella infestation on C. douglasii in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, implying that the fly in these regions is not native on hawthorn. There are recorded sightings of R. pomonella from Southern Utah and New Mexico, as well as in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains and the Altiplano central highlands of Mexico. The original ancestral host of the apple maggot was the wild hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), but in the mid-1800s when the apple (Malus spp.) was introduced to North America, R. pomonella, able to take advantage of the new host, evolved. Peach, pear, cherry, plum, chokeberry, cranberry, dogwood, and fruits of the Japanese roses Rosa rugosa and Rosa carolina can also host apple maggots.Dean, R.W. and Chapman, P.J. (1973) Bionomics of the apple maggot in eastern New York. Search Agric. Entomol. Geneva No. 3, Geneva, N.Y. 1–62 However, apple maggots are not usually a serious pest of plums, cherries, and pears; larvae have been found in pears but not adult flies. Life history Flies emerge in the summer beginning in June and continuing through August and September, and eggs are laid in the apple fruit. The fly cycles through one generation a year with adults living up to four weeks. In Oregon and Washington, apple maggots have been found to emerge in early July with peak times in late August or early September. Flies have been found as late as November, and larvae have been found in late December. Females deposit eggs one by one via ovipositor in the skin of the fruit. Punctures are difficult to see with the naked eye at first but are visible once the wound darkens. A female can produce 300 to 400 eggs in her lifetime, and eggs develop in succession and are deposited as soon as they mature. Studies show that eggs develop faster at warmer temperatures that they do at cooler temperatures. When the weather is exceptionally warm, eggs may develop just two weeks after emergence. Eggs hatch within two to six days, and larvae feed on the fruit ranging from two weeks to more than two months, depending on temperature and on the hardness of the fruit. Young larvae are difficult to see because they are the same white color as the pulp. Larvae spend the pupal stage in the soil at a depth of one to two inches in the ground or sometimes in decayed fruit. Early-emerging larvae may only spend a month in the pupal stage, but late- emerging larvae remain dormant throughout the winter. Feeding behavior Haws and crab-apples are the original food source of the flies, but they have moved to feeding on mainly apples, though they have been found feeding on other cultivated fruits. Male and female flies feed constantly from the surface of their food source, primarily apples. The fly extends its proboscis and drops saliva onto the skin of the apple, and the saliva is used as a solvent for substances on the apple. If drier substances are present, the fly dissolves them before sucking up fluid. Larvae use chitinous hooks to cut through pulp just below the skin of the fruit, producing characteristic brown markings, leading to the larvae being called \\"railroad worms\\". If the apples are still growing, larvae burrows are difficult to find because they heal quickly. Softened apples allow larvae to grow rapidly and break down pulp, even to the point of feeding at the core. Mating R. pomonella adult flies may begin copulation as early as eight days old. Males attempt copulation when females are in oviposition on fruit. The male springs onto the female and positions his forefeet on her abdomen and his second pair of feet on her wings. The male waits and uncoils his spring-like penis, quickly entering the opening of the ovipositor when the female extends it. Mating occurs on the host plant and averages thirty minutes, during which the flies are attached and can fly about. Then, when the flies separate, the ovipositor and penis are quickly retracted. The flies undergo multiple matings, which benefits both sexes. Generally, multiple mating is thought to be a more adaptive strategy for males because of male potential to fertilize many females and the trend of greater female parental investment. However, studies have shown increased female fecundity and fertility from multiple matings. Females have long-term sperm storage, and there is little to no parental investment after she lays eggs. A 2000 study by Opp and Prokopy found that male and female apple maggot flies mated up to six times a day in males and eight times in females, thus there is most likely no mating refractory period, unlike other tephritid species like Mediterranean fruit flies, whose females may mate only after stored sperm is depleted. Threats = Predators = The apple maggot is not as heavily targeted by predators and parasites as other insects because for most of its lifespan it is inaccessible, living inside apples as larvae and in soil as pupae. Occasionally flies are captured by various species of spiders, such as the Dendryphantes militaris Hentz, which predates on flies in apple trees. Birds may feed on larvae, pupae, or adults. Some full-grown maggots leaving the apples are taken by ants. The maggot stage has other predators including several braconid wasps: Utetes canaliculatus, Diachasmimorpha mellea, and Diachasma alloeum. = Egg parasite = A 1920 study showed that apple maggot eggs were parasitized by Anaphoidea conotrecheli Girault, which is a common egg parasite of plum curculio and grape curculio. The study states that the abundance of Anaphoidea conotrecheli parasitization of apple maggot eggs would depend on the abundance of the eggs of its principal host, the plum curculio. = Larval parasite = Opius mellus Gahan (Biosteres rhagoletis Richmond) was bred from puparia of apple maggots in Maine in 1914 and was also found in blueberry barrens. This parasite was also found by other researchers in other parts of Maine and in Nova Scotia. The parasite oviposits in the maggots, which then mature and enter the pupal stage as usual. However, the maggot does not develop normally from here on out; come spring, an adult parasite emerges from the puparium. In a 1922 study, Opius ferrugineus Gahan was also found to emerge as a parasite from apple maggot puparia. Protective mimicry The adult fly uses Batesian mimicry for defense. The fly has white markings on its thorax and a characteristic black banding shaped like an \\"F\\" on its wings. When threatened, it turns its wings 90° and moves them up and down while walking sideways; the combination mimics the appearance of the jumping spider due to the wing pattern in the new position appearing as additional legs, specifically the forelegs and pedipalps. Evolution Rhagoletis pomonella is representative of evolution; the race that feeds on apples spontaneously evolved from the hawthorn-feeding race in 1800 to 1850 CE after apples were introduced into North America. The apple-feeding race does not normally feed on hawthorns, and the hawthorn-feeding race does not normally feed on apples. This constitutes a possible example of an early step towards the emergence of a new species, a case of sympatric speciation.Feder, J. L. (1998) \\"The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella: flies in the face of conventional wisdom about speciation?\\" In Howard, D. J. & Berlocher, S. H. (Eds.) Endless Forms: Species and Speciation. New York, Oxford University Press. In addition, the hawthorn and apple host races of R. pomonella are able to produce viable offspring in a lab setting, but in nature, flies maintain their genetic integrity partly because of allochronic premating isolation from differently timed adult eclosion. Flies that infest apples eclose before flies that infest the hawthorn, which fruits later than apples. The emergence of the apple race of R. pomonella also appears to have driven formation of new races among its parasites. Interactions with humans R. pomonella is a significant pest for apple crops because the species feeds on apples and lays eggs within the fruit. The hatched maggots burrow tunnels within the apples and cause them to fall prematurely and create unsightly brown spots. Rhagoletis mendax Curran or the blueberry maggot fly is a related species that is a pest of cultivated blueberries. = Control = Infestation of maggots damages the fruit through the formation of winding tunnels. There is no external indication of maggots, but brown trails can be seen beneath the skin. Therefore, to manage apple maggot infestation, farmers may destroy infested apples, hawthorn, and abandoned apple trees. Apple maggots may be killed by placing infested fruit in cold storage of 32 degrees Fahrenheit for forty days. Some biological control agents have not been found to be effective because apple maggots are hidden within the fruit. Sprays for control of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, have been able to partially control the apple maggot but cannot be completely depended on for commercially accepted control. Naturally occurring parasitoids have been suggested to be used to manage the apple maggot. Opius downesi Gahan and Opius lectoides Gahan shifted from the show berry maggot to apple maggots in hawthorn, reducing apple maggot density at two study sites in Oregon, according to a paper published in 1985.AliNiazee.

It can occur as a single attack, a series of attacks, or a persistent condition that diminishes over three to six weeks. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and eye nystagmus. The cause is often not clear. It may be due to a virus, but it can also arise from bacterial infection, head injury, extreme stress, an allergy, or as a reaction to medication. 30% of affected people had a common cold prior to developing the disease. Either bacterial or viral labyrinthitis can cause a permanent hearing loss in rare cases. This appears to result from an imbalance of neuronal input between the left and right inner ears. Signs and symptoms The main symptoms of labyrinthitis are severe vertigo and nystagmus. The most common symptom for vestibular neuritis is the onset of vertigo that has formed from an ongoing infection or trauma. The dizziness sensation that is associated with vertigo is thought to be from the inner ear labyrinth. Rapid and undesired eye motion (nystagmus) often results from the improper indication of rotational motion. Nausea, anxiety, and a general ill feeling are common due to the distorted balance signals that the brain receives from the inner ear system. Causes Some people will report having an upper respiratory infection (common cold) or flu prior to the onset of the symptoms of vestibular neuritis; others will have no viral symptoms prior to the vertigo attack. Some cases of vestibular neuritis are thought to be caused by an infection of the vestibular ganglion by the herpes simplex type 1 virus. However, the cause of this condition is not fully understood, and in fact, many different viruses may be capable of infecting the vestibular nerve. Acute localized ischemia of these structures also may be an important cause, especially in children, vestibular neuritis may be preceded by symptoms of a common cold. However, the causative mechanism remains uncertain. This can also be brought on by pressure changes such as those experienced while flying or scuba diving. Mechanism In the vestibular system, there are three canals that are semicircular in shape that input sensory clues. These canals allow the brain to sense rotational motion and linear motion changes. The brain then uses the sensory input clues and the visual input clues from the vestibular system to retain balance. The vestibulo–ocular reflex retains continuous visual focus during motion which is also the vestibular systems job during activity. Treatment The treatment for vestibular neuritis depends on the cause. However, symptoms of vertigo can be treated in the same way as other vestibular dysfunctions with vestibular rehabilitation. =Physical therapy= Typical treatments include combinations of head and eye movements, postural changes, and walking exercises. Specifically, exercises that may be prescribed include keeping eyes fixated on a specific target while moving the head, moving the head right to left at two targets at a significant distance apart, walking while keeping eyes fixated on a specific target, and walking while keeping eyes fixated on a specific target while also turning the head in different directions. The main function behind repeating a combination of head and eye movements, postural changes and walking is that through this repetition, compensatory changes for the dysfunctions arising from peripheral vestibular structures may be promoted in the central vestibular system (brainstem and cerebellum). Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is a highly effective way to substantially reduce or eliminate residual dizziness from labyrinthitis. VRT works by causing the brain to use already existing neural mechanisms for adaptation, neuroplasticity, and compensation. Vestibular neuritis rehabilitation is an effective and safe management to improve symptoms. The vestibular neuritis rehabilitation can improve symptoms or resolve the symptoms which is dependent on each individual. Rehabilitation strategies most commonly used are: *Gaze stability exercises – moving the head from side to side while fixated on a stationary object (aimed at assisting the eye to fixate during head rotation without the input from the lost canal vestibulo–ocular reflex). An advanced progression of this exercise would be walking in a straight line while looking side to side by turning the head. *Habituation exercises – movements designed to provoke symptoms and subsequently reduce the negative vestibular response upon repetition. Examples of these include Brandt–Daroff exercises. *Functional retraining – including postural control, relaxation, and balance training. These exercises function by challenging the vestibular system. Progression occurs by increasing the amplitude of the head or focal point movements, increasing the speed of movement, and combining movements such as walking and head turning. One study found that patients who believed their illness was out of their control showed the slowest progression to full recovery, long after the initial vestibular injury had healed. The study revealed that the patient who compensated well was one who, at the psychological level, was not afraid of the symptoms and had some positive control over them. Notably, a reduction in negative beliefs over time was greater in those patients treated with rehabilitation than in those untreated. \\"Of utmost importance, baseline beliefs were the only significant predictor of change in a handicap at 6 months follow-up.\\" =Medication= Vestibular neuritis is generally a self-limiting disease. Treatment with drugs is neither necessary nor possible. The effect of glucocorticoids has been studied, but they have not been found to significantly affect long-term outcome. Symptomatic treatment with antihistaminics such as cinnarizine, however, can be used to suppress the symptoms of vestibular neuritis while it spontaneously regresses. Prochlorperazine is another commonly prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms of vertigo and nausea. =Other= Because mood disorders can interfere with the vestibular compensation and adaptive plasticity, it suggested to address any co-occurring anxiety disorder and/or depression. Severe anxiety episodes are usually addressed by short-term benzodiazapine therapy. Long-term use of benzodiazapines such as diazepam, however, is not recommended due to the tolerance issues. SSRIs and SSNRIs are among a number of first - line treatments for anxiety or depression. Prognosis Recovery from acute labyrinthine inflammation generally takes from one to six weeks, but it is not uncommon for residual symptoms (dysequilibrium and/or dizziness) to last for a couple of months. Recovery from a temporary damaged inner ear typically follows two phases: # An acute period, which may include severe vertigo and vomiting # approximately two weeks of sub-acute symptoms and rapid recovery  Epidemiology  Vestibular neuritis also known as labyrinthitis affects approximately 35 million people per year. Vestibular neuritis typically occurs in those between 30 and 60 years of age. There is no significant gender difference when determining who will get this disease. In 95% of cases, vestibular neuritis is a one-time experience that results in most people fully recovering from it. Vestibular rehabilitation showed a statistically significant increase in controlling symptoms over no intervention in people who have vestibular neuritis.

Officially, the area was known as \\"closed military townlet No. 1\\" and at various times had also been designated as Shchyolkovo-14 () and Zvyozdny (). Flag Mir mockup in the training center pool Overview Cosmonauts of the Russian Federal Space Agency, and the Soviet space program before it, have lived and trained in Star City since the 1960s. In the Soviet era the location was a highly secret and guarded military installation, access to which was severely restricted. Many Russian cosmonauts, past and present, and Training Centre's personnel, live in Star City with their families. The facility has its own post office, high school, shops, child day care/kindergarten, movie theater, sports and recreation facilities, railway station, and a museum of space travel and human exploration. Air transportation is available through nearby Chkalovsky Airport. In the summer 1992, American \\"Youth Science Ambassadors\\" sponsored by People to People International were hosted at Star City where they were treated to a presentation by cosmonaut Anatoly Artsebarsky. In the mid- to late 1990s, groups of select students from high school in Star City participated in the Russian American Cultural Exchange Program (RACE). Students first hosted, then visited, American counterparts attending five high schools in the United States of America. There is a statue of the \\"space dog\\" Laika, the first animal to orbit the earth, in Star City. Transportation Transportation needs are met by the no. 380 bus route and taxis that stop near the border checkpoints, and by a railway station located at a short walking distance. Incorporation For most of its history, the space training center was in jurisdiction of the Soviet and then Russian military. However, in August 1996, due to the changes in legislation the center became subordinated both to the Ministry of Defense and to the Roscosmos (Russian Federal Space Agency).Official website of Zvyozdny Gorodok Urban Okrug. Historical reference This double status remained in effect until October 1, 2008, when the center was re-organized and subordinated directly and solely to the Roscosmos. As a result, the status of the territory of Star City was changed from military to civil, and the territory itself was incorporated as a closed administrative- territorial formation of Zvyozdny gorodok. Within the closed formation, the territory was organized on June 16, 2009 as an inhabited locality with the status of a work settlement. A proposal to officially name the work settlement as Zvyozdny gorodok was submitted to the federal government on October 29, 2009, but as of 2011 has not yet been officially approved.

This may involve similarity, love, romance, platonic relationships, comfort, intimacy, sexuality, sexual activity, spirituality, compatibility and trust.  Definition  In current usage, \\"soulmate\\" usually refers to a romantic or platonic partner, with the implication of an exclusive lifelong bond. It commonly holds the connotation of being the strongest bond with another person that one can achieve. It is commonly accepted that one will feel 'complete' once they have found their soulmate, as it is partially in the perceived definition that two souls are meant to unite. The term \\"soulmate\\" first appeared in the English language in a letter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1822. =Criticism= Some psychologists state that believing that a soulmate exists specifically for a person is an unrealistic expectation. Historical usages of the concept =Theosophy= According to the esoteric religious movement Theosophy, whose claims were modified by Edgar Cayce, God created androgynous souls—equally male and female. Later theories postulate that the souls split into separate genders, perhaps because they incurred karma while playing around on the Earth, or \\"separation from God.\\" Over a number of reincarnations, each half seeks the other. When all karmic debt is purged, the two will fuse back together and return to the ultimate.Krajenke, Robert W. (1972). Suddenly We Were!: a Story of Creation Based on the Edgar Cayce Readings. A.R.E.

Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, a soulmate is a separate entity with whom one has spent many lifetimes as a friend, lover, co-worker or partner, and to whom one is usually drawn to fulfill a specific mission.Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Soulmates and Twin Flames: The Spiritual Dimension of Love and Relationships. Summit University Press, 1998. They describe a soulmate as one of many potential spiritual brothers or sisters: \\"even though there may be a great attraction and bond between soulmates, fundamentally, in the ultimate sense, you could define it more as a brother/sister relationship, even though soulmates have great marriages and a great union of hearts.\\" According to Mark Prophet: \\"A soulmate relationship has to do with the seat of the soul Chandra, that Chandra just above the base ...

(603–666) was a powerful military dictator in the waning days of Goguryeo, which was one of the Three Kingdoms of ancient Korea. He is remembered for his successful resistance against Tang China under Emperor Taizong and his son Emperor Gaozong. Traditional Korean histories painted Yeon Gaesomun as a despotic leader, whose cruel policies and disobedience to his monarch led to the fall of Goguryeo. However, his achievements in defending Goguryeo against Chinese onslaughts have inspired Korean nationalist historians, most notably the 19th-century Korean historian and intellectual Sin Chaeho, to term Yeon Gaesomun the greatest hero in Korean history. Many Korean scholars today echo Shin Chaeho and praise Yeon Gaesomun as a soldier-statesman without equal in Korean history. Biography Yeon Gaesomun was born into the influential and distinguished Yeon family as the first and oldest son of Yeon Taejo, the prime minister (막리지, 莫離支) of Goguryeo during the reigns of King Pyeongwon and King Yeongyang. His grandfather Yeon Ja-yu was also a prime minister. Information about Yeon Gaesomun comes largely from the Samguk sagis biographical accounts of King Yeongnyu, King Bojang, and Yeon Gaesomun himself, and tomb engravings and biographical accounts, from the New Book of Tang, dedicated to his sons Yeon Namsaeng and Yeon Namsan. Tang Chinese historical records give Yeon Gaesomun's surname as Cheon (泉, Quán in Chinese, meaning \\"water spring\\"), because Yeon (淵, Yuān in Chinese, meaning \\"riverhead\\") was the given name of Emperor Gaozu (Lǐ Yuān, 李淵), the founding emperor of Tang, and thus subject to the naming taboo by Chinese tradition. Yeon Gaesomun is also sometimes referred to as Gaegeum (개금/蓋金). In the Nihon Shoki, he appears as Iri Kasumi (伊梨柯須彌).Nihon Shoki, First year of Empress Kōgyoku (642); 秋九月。大臣伊梨柯須彌殺大王。并殺伊梨渠世斯等百八十餘人。 Since both Yeon Gaesomun and Iri Kasumi are transcriptions from Chinese and Japanese intending to approximate his Korean name, his actual name can be reconstructed as \\"Eol Kasum\\".Chang, Sekyung, Phonetic and phonological study on the different transcriptions of the Same personal names, Seoul: Dongguk University (1990). Very little is known of Yeon Gaesomun's early days, until he became the Western Governor (西部大人), where he oversaw the building of the Cheolli Jangseong, a network of military garrisons to defend Liaodong from Tang. Yeon Gaesomun had at least three sons: (eldest to youngest) Yeon Namsaeng, Yeon Namgeon, and Yeon Namsan. =Overthrow of the throne= In the winter of 642, King Yeongnyu was apprehensive about Yeon Gaesomun and plotted with his other officials to kill him. When Yeon Gaesomun discovered the plot, he arranged a lavish banquet to celebrate his rise to the position of Eastern Governor (东部大人) to which one hundred of the opposing politicians of the nation were invited. Yeon Gaesomun ambushed and killed all one hundred politicians present, and then proceeded to the palace and murdered King Yeongnyu. According to traditional Chinese and Korean sources, Yeon Gaesomun's men dismembered the king's corpse and discarded it without proper ceremony. After placing King Bojang (r. 642-668),a nephew of King Yeongnyu, on the Goguryeo throne, Yeon Gaesomun appointed himself the Dae Magniji (대막리지, 大莫離支, generalissimo) and assumed absolute de facto control over Goguryeo affairs of state until his death around 666. Yeon Gaesomun's coup d'état came as the culmination of a lengthy power struggle between those in the government who favored appeasement toward Tang China and those who advocated military confrontation; Yeon Gaesomun belonged to the hard-liners. Traditional Chinese and Korean historians assumed that Yeon Gaseomun's motive was simply his thirst for power, but many modern Korean historians assert that his motive was to make Goguryeo assume a tougher stance against Tang China, as opposed to King Yeongnyu who submitted to Tang for a peaceful diplomatic relationship. Yeon Gaesomun's role in the murder of King Yeongnyu was taken as the primary pretext for the failed Tang invasion of 645. =Wars with China= The series of wars between Goguryeo and Tang China comprise some of the most important events in the ancient history of Northeast Asia, leading to the Tang–Silla alliance, the ultimate demise of powerful Goguryeo, and the unification of the Korean Peninsula under Silla control. Yeon Gaesomun was a central protagonist in this series of conflicts, as well as its primary cause. At the outset of his rule, Yeon Gaesomun took a brief conciliatory stance toward Tang China. For instance, he supported Taoism at the expense of Buddhism, and to this effect in 643, sent emissaries to the Tang court requesting Taoist sages, eight of whom were brought to Goguryeo. This gesture is considered by some historians as an effort to pacify Tang and buy time to prepare for the Tang invasion Yeon thought inevitable given his ambitions to annex Silla. Relations with Tang deteriorated when Goguryeo launched new invasions of Silla. In 645, the first conflict of the Goguryeo–Tang War began and Emperor Taizong's noted military acumen enabled him to conquer a number of major Goguryeo border fortresses. Eventually, however, Emperor Taizong's invasion was met with two major setbacks. First, his main army was stymied and bogged down for several months at Ansi Fortress due to the resistance of the celebrated commander Yang Manchun. Second, the elite marine force that he sent to take Pyongyang, Goguryeo's capital, was defeated by Yeon Gaesomun who, according to the Joseon Sanggosa, then immediately marched his legions to relieve Yang Manchun's forces at Ansi Fortress. Emperor Taizong, caught between Yang Manchun's army in the front and Yeon Gaesomun's counter-attacking forces closing in from behind, as well as suffering from the harsh winter and dangerously low food supplies, was forced to retreat homeward. Before setting off, Emperor Taizong left behind 100 bolts of silk cloth out of respect to Yang Manchun. The retreat was difficult and many of his soldiers died. Emperor Taizong's campaign against Goguryeo was unsuccessful. However, he succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on Goguryeo. Upon returning home, Emperor Taizong founded the Minzhong Temple, the oldest temple in Beijing, to commemorate his soldiers who died in Goguryeo. He invaded Goguryeo again in 647 and 648, but was defeated both times, and thus was unable to accomplish his ambition of conquering Goguryeo in his lifetime. Conquering Goguryeo had been an obsession with Emperor Taizong, and after his death in 649, his son Emperor Gaozong continued his ambition. After the Tang-Silla alliance conquered Baekje, Emperor Gaozong invaded Goguryeo in 661 and 662. One of Yeon Gaesomun's greatest victories came in 662, when his forces defeated Tang general Pang Xiaotai (龐孝泰) and his Lingnan army at the Sasu River (蛇水, probably Botong River). Pang Xiaotai and all his 13 sons were killed in combat. Famed Tang general Su Dingfang (蘇定方), who was instrumental in conquering Baekje, was unable to overcome Pyongyang's defenses and was forced to withdraw due to harsh snowstorms. With increasing domestic turmoil in China, Tang was once again forced to retreat. However, Goguryeo's population and economy were severely damaged due to the long years of continuous warfare. Yeon Gaesomun died in 666 of a natural cause, and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and further weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla. Tang mounted a fresh invasion in 667, aided by Silla and the defector Yeon Namsaeng, and was finally able to conquer Goguryeo in 668. =Death= The most likely date of Yeon Gaesomun's death is that recorded on the tomb stele of his eldest son Yeon Namsaeng on the twenty- fourth year of the reign of King Bojang (665). However, the Samguk sagi records the year as 666, and the Nihon Shoki gives the year as the twenty- third year of the reign of King Bojang (664). Legends According to a local Chinese legend in the 19th-century Funing County Annals (阜宁县志): during a campaign, Emperor Taizong was scouting ahead of his army and was almost captured when he discovered Yeon Gaesomun's encampment and was recognized by the latter, but narrowly escaped by hiding in a decrepit well; later, Emperor Taizong had a pagoda (朦朧塔) erected near the location.http://jhwsw.com/zzdzb/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=3204 Historical depictions Tang and Silla sources portrayed Yeon Gaesomun as a brutal and arrogant dictator who carried five swords at a time, and had men prostrate themselves so that he could use their backs to mount and dismount his horse. In popular culture Yeon Gaesomun sometimes appears as a door god in Taoist temples in partnership with the Tang general Xue Rengui. In some Chinese legends, Xue Rengui and Yeon Gaesomun are the reincarnations of the White Tiger's Star and Azure Dragon's Star, respectively. =Film and television= *Portrayed by Jo Kyung-hwan in the 1992 KBS TV series Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms. *Portrayed by Lee Won-jong in the 2003 film Once Upon a Time in a Battlefield and its 2011 sequel Battlefield Heroes. *Portrayed by Yoo Dong- geun, Lee Tae-gon and Eun Won-jae in the 2006-2007 SBS TV series Yeon Gaesomun. *Portrayed by Kim Jin-tae in the 2006–2007 KBS TV series Dae Jo Yeong. *Portrayed by Ko In-beom in the 2011 MBC TV series Gyebaek. *Portrayed by Choi Dong-joon in the 2012–2013 KBS TV series The King's Dream. *Portrayed by Choi Min-soo in the 2013 KBS2 TV series The Blade and Petal. *Portrayed by Yu Oh-seong in the 2018 film The Great Battle. =Literature= Yeon Gaesomun (under the name Gai Suwen) appears in Peking opera as the archvillain of the famed Tang general Xue Rengui, who rescues Emperor Taizong from Yeon Gaesomun's pursuit.

Superheated steam can therefore cool (lose internal energy) by some amount, resulting in a lowering of its temperature without changing state (i.e., condensing) from a gas, to a mixture of saturated vapor and liquid. If unsaturated steam (a mixture which contains both water vapor and liquid water droplets) is heated at constant pressure, its temperature will also remain constant as the vapor quality (think dryness, or percent saturated vapor) increases towards 100%, and becomes dry (i.e., no saturated liquid) saturated steam. Continued heat input will then \\"super\\" heat the dry saturated steam. This will occur if saturated steam contacts a surface with a higher temperature. Superheated steam and liquid water cannot coexist under thermodynamic equilibrium, as any additional heat simply evaporates more water and the steam will become saturated steam. However this restriction may be violated temporarily in dynamic (non-equilibrium) situations. To produce superheated steam in a power plant or for processes (such as drying paper) the saturated steam drawn from a boiler is passed through a separate heating device (a superheater) which transfers additional heat to the steam by contact or by radiation. Superheated steam is not suitable for sterilization.William D. Wise, \\"Succeed at steam sterilization, \\"Chemical processing\\" 27 November 2005. Retrieved 2010-10-10. This is because the superheated steam is dry. Dry steam must reach much higher temperatures and the materials exposed for a longer time period to have the same effectiveness; or equal F0 kill value. Superheated steam is also not useful for heating, but it has more energy and can do more work than saturated steam, but the heat content is much less useful. This is because superheated steam has the same heat transfer coefficient of air, making it an insulator - a poor conductor of heat. Saturated steam has a much higher wall heat transfer coefficient. Slightly superheated steam may be used for antimicrobial disinfection of biofilms on hard surfaces. Superheated steam's greatest value lies in its tremendous internal energy that can be used for kinetic reaction through mechanical expansion against turbine blades and reciprocating pistons, that produces rotary motion of a shaft. The value of superheated steam in these applications is its ability to release tremendous quantities of internal energy yet remain above the condensation temperature of water vapor; at the pressures at which reaction turbines and reciprocating piston engines operate. Of prime importance in these applications is the fact that water vapor containing entrained liquid droplets is generally incompressible at those pressures. In a reciprocating engine or turbine, if steam doing work cools to a temperature at which liquid droplets form, then the water droplets entrained in the fluid flow will strike the mechanical parts with enough force to bend, crack or fracture them.Leyzerovich, A. S., Wet-Steam Turbines for Nuclear Power Plants, PennWell, USA, 2005. Superheating and pressure reduction through expansion ensures that the steam flow remains as a compressible gas throughout its passage through a turbine or an engine, preventing damage of the internal moving parts.  Saturated steam  Saturated steam is steam that is in equilibrium with heated water at the same pressure, i.e., it has not been heated above the boiling point for its pressure. This is in contrast to superheated steam, in which the steam (vapor) has been separated from the water droplets then additional heat has been added. These condensation droplets are a cause of damage to steam turbine blades, the reason why such turbines rely on a supply of dry, superheated steam. Dry steam is saturated steam that has been very slightly superheated. This is not sufficient to change its energy appreciably, but is a sufficient rise in temperature to avoid condensation problems, given the average loss in temperature across the steam supply circuit. Towards the end of the 19th century, when superheating was still a less-than-certain technology, such steam-drying gave the condensation-avoiding benefits of superheating without requiring the sophisticated boiler or lubrication techniques of full superheating. By contrast, water vapor that includes water droplets is described as wet steam. If wet steam is heated further, the droplets evaporate, and at a high enough temperature (which depends on the pressure) all of the water evaporates, the system is in vapor–liquid equilibrium, and it becomes saturated steam. Saturated steam is advantageous in heat transfer due to the high latent heat of vaporization. It is a very efficient mode of heat transfer. In layman's terms, saturated steam is at its dew point at the corresponding temperature and pressure. The typical latent heat of vaporization (or condensation) is 970 Btu/lb (2256.5 kJ/kg) for saturated steam at atmospheric pressure. Uses =Steam engine= Superheated steam was widely used in main line steam locomotives. Saturated steam has three main disadvantages in a steam engine: it contains small droplets of water which have to be periodically drained from the cylinders; being precisely at the boiling point of water for the boiler pressure in use, it inevitably condenses to some extent in the steam pipes and cylinders outside the boiler, causing a disproportionate loss of steam volume as it does so; and it places a heavy demand on the boiler. Superheating the steam dries it effectively, raises its temperature to a point where condensation is much less likely and increases its volume significantly. Added together, these factors increase the power and economy of the locomotive. The main disadvantages are the added complexity and cost of the superheater tubing and the adverse effect that the \\"dry\\" steam has on lubrication of moving components such as the steam valves. Shunting locomotives did not generally use superheating. The normal arrangement involved taking steam after the regulator valve and passing it through long superheater tubes inside specially large firetubes of the boiler. The superheater tubes had a reverse (\\"torpedo\\") bend at the firebox end so that the steam had to pass the length of the boiler at least twice, picking up heat as it did so. =Processing= Other potential uses of superheated steam include: drying, cleaning, layering, reaction engineering, epoxy drying and film use where saturated to highly superheated steam is required at one atmospheric pressure or at high pressure. Ideal for steam drying, steam oxidation and chemical processing. Uses are in surface technologies, cleaning technologies, steam drying, catalysis, chemical reaction processing, surface drying technologies, curing technologies, energy systems and nanotechnologies. Superheated steam is not usually used in a heat exchanger due to low heat transfer co-efficient.Superheated Steam : International site for Spirax Sarco. Spiraxsarco.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-25. In refining and hydrocarbon industries superheated steam is mainly used for stripping and cleaning purposes. =Pest control= Steam has been used for soil steaming since the 1890s. Steam is induced into the soil which causes almost all organic material to deteriorate (the term \\"sterilization\\" is used, but it is not strictly correct since all micro-organism are not necessarily killed). Soil steaming is an effective alternative to many chemicals in agriculture, and is used widely by greenhouse growers. Wet steam is primarily used in this process, but if soil temperatures above the boiling point of water are required, superheated steam must be used.

Vertically transmitted fungal endophytes are typically considered clonal and transmit via fungal hyphae penetrating the embryo within the host's seeds, while reproduction of the fungi through asexual conidia or sexual spores leads to horizontal transmission, where endophytes may spread between plants in a population or community.  Symbiosis  Most endophyte-plant relationships are still not well understood. Endophytes and plants often engage in mutualism, with endophytes primarily aiding in the health and survival of the host plant with issues such as pathogens and disease, water stress, heat stress, nutrient availability and poor soil quality, salinity, and herbivory. In exchange the endophyte receives carbon for energy from the plant host. Plant-microbe interactions are not strictly mutualistic, as endophytic fungi can potentially become pathogens or saprotrophs, usually when the plant in stressed. Endophytes may become active and reproduce under specific environmental conditions or when their host plants are stressed or begin to senesce, thereby limiting the amount of carbon provided to the endophyte. Endophytes may benefit host plants by preventing other pathogenic or parasitic organisms from colonizing them. Endophytes can extensively colonize plant tissues and competitively exclude other potential pathogens. Some fungal and bacterial endophytes have proven to increase plant growth and improve overall plant hardiness. Studies have shown that endophytic fungi grow in a very intimate interaction with their host plant cells. Fungal hyphae have been seen growing either flattened or wedged against plant cells. This growth pattern indicates that fungal hyphae are substantially attached to the plant host's cell wall, but do not invade plant cells. Endophytic fungal hyphae appear to grow at the same rate as their host leaves, within the intercellular spaces of the plant tissue. The presence of certain fungal endophytes in host meristems, leaves and reproductive structures has been shown to dramatically enhance the survival of their hosts. This enhanced survivability is largely attributed to endophytic production of secondary metabolites which protect against herbivory as well as increased uptake of nutrients. Studies have also shown that during experimental circumstances endophytes contribute significantly to plant growth and fitness under light-limited conditions, and plants appear to have increased reliance on their endophytic symbiont under these conditions. There is evidence that plants and endophytes engage in communication with each other that can aid symbiosis. For example, plant chemical signals have been shown to activate gene expression in endophytes. One example of this plant-endosymbiont interaction occurs between dicotyledonous plants in the Convolvulaceae and clavicipitaceous fungi. When the fungus is in the plant it synthesizes ergoline alkaloids at a higher rate, compared to when it is grown apart from the plant. This supports the hypothesis that plant signaling is required in order to induce expression of endophytic secondary metabolites.  Diversity  Endophytic species are very diverse; only a small minority of existing endophytes have been characterized. Many endophytes are in the phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Endophytic fungi may be from Hypocreales and Xylariales of the Sordariomycetes (Pyrenomycetes) class or from the class of Loculoascomycetes. One group of fungal endophytes are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi involving biotrophic Glomeromycota associated with various plant species. As often with other organisms associated with plants such as mycorrhizal fungus, endophytes gain carbon from their association with the plant host. Bacterial endophytes are polyphyletic, belonging to broad range of taxa, including α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria. One or more endophytic organisms are found in nearly every land plant. It is suggested that areas of high plant diversity such as tropical rainforests may also contain the highest diversity of endophytic organisms that possess novel and diverse chemical metabolites. It has been estimated that there could be approximately 1 million endophytic fungi that exist in the world. A diazotrophic bacterium isolated in lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) in British Columbia, Canada, is Paenibacillus polymyxa, which may help its host by fixing nitrogen.  Classification  Endophytes include a wide variety of microorganisms including fungi, bacteria and viruses. There are two different means of classifying endophytes. = Systemic and non-systemic = The first method divides endophytes into two categories: systemic (true) and nonsystemic (transient). These categories are based on the endophyte's genetics, biology and mechanism of transmission from host to host. Systemic endophytes are defined as organisms that live within plant tissues for the entirety of its life cycle and participate in a symbiotic relationship without causing disease or harm to the plant at any point. Additionally systemic endophytes concentrations and diversity do not change in a host with changing environmental conditions. Non-systemic or transient endophytes on the other hand vary in number and diversity within their plant hosts under changing environmental conditions. Non-systemic endophytes have also been shown to become pathogenic to their host plants under stressful or resource limited growing conditions. = Clavicipitaceous and non-clavicipitaceous = The second method divides fungal endophytes into four groups based on taxonomy and six other criteria: host range, host tissues colonized, in planta colonization, in planta biodiversity, mode of transmission and fitness benefits. These four groups are divided into clavicipitaceous endophytes (Class 1) and non-clavicipitaceous endophytes (Class 2, 3, and 4). Class 1 endophytes are all phylogenetically related and proliferate within cool and warm season grasses. They typically colonize plant shoots where they form a systemic intercellular infection. Class 1 endophytes are mainly transmitted from host to host by vertical transmission, in which maternal plants pass fungi on to their offspring through seeds. Class 1 endophytes can further be divided into Types I, II and III. Among these three types of clavicipitaceous endophytes are different interactions with their plant hosts. These interaction range from pathogenic to symbiotic and symptomatic to asymptomatic. Type III clavicipitaceous endophytes grow within their plant host without manifesting symptoms of disease or harming their host. Class 1 endophytes typically confer benefits on their plant host such as improving plant biomass, increasing drought tolerance and increasing the production of chemicals that are toxic and unappetizing to animals, thereby decreasing herbivory. These benefits can vary depending on the host and environmental conditions. Non-clavicipitaceous endophytes represent a polyphyletic group of organisms. Non-clavicipitaceous endophytes are typically Ascomycota fungi. The ecological roles of these fungi are diverse and still poorly understood. These endophyte plant interactions are widespread and have been found in nearly all land plants and ecosystems. Many non-clavicipitaceous endophytes have the ability to switch between endophytic behavior and free-living lifestyles. Non- clavicipitaceous endophytes are divided into class 2, 3 and 4. Class 2 endophytes can grow in plant tissues both above and below ground. This class of non-clavicipitaceous endophytes has been the most extensively researched and has been shown to enhance fitness benefits of their plant host as a result of habitat-specific stresses such as pH, temperature and salinity. Class 3 endophytes are restricted to growth in below ground plant tissues and form in localized areas of plant tissue. Class 4 endophytes are also restricted to plant tissues below ground but can colonize much more of the plant tissue. These classes of non-clavicipitaceous endophytes have not been as extensively studied to date. Applications  Endophytes may have potential future applications in agriculture. Use of endophytes might potentially increase crop yields. Turfgrass seed of Festuca and Lolium perenne infected with fungal inoculants, Acremonium coenophialum and A. lolii, is commercially available for use in growing lawns which might require less pesticide use -the grasses are poisonous to cattle and more resistant to some insect damage. As of 1999 this is only available in the afore-mentioned lawn grasses, which are sold as 'low maintenance' cultivars. The fungi cause the grasses to contain toxic alkaloids. The products provide high resistance to foliar lawn pests such as billbugs, chinch bugs, sod webworms, fall army-worms and Argentine stem weevils, but offer little protection to pests of grass roots such as grubs. The endophytes can survive most pesticides and are even resistant to some fungicides, and are very suitable for use in Integrated Pest Management. =Biofuel= A 2008 experiment with an isolate of a fungus called NRRL 50072 have found that this strain can produce a small amount of fuel-like hydrocarbon compounds which was promoted as \\"myco-diesel\\". It was hoped that perhaps in the future this might provide a possible source of biofuel. It was first misidentified as the endophyte Gliocladium roseum, but later research showed that it was in fact the saprophyte Ascocoryne sarcoides. A strain of endophytic fungi which appeared to be closely related to Nigrograna mackinnonii which was isolated from a stem of the plant Guazuma ulmifolia collected in Ecuador was found to produce a variety of volatile organic compounds including terpenes and odd chain polyenes. The polyenes isolated from the fungus have properties that are sought in gasoline-surrogate biofuels. =Phytoremediation= Plants are potentially able to break down or sequester, or stimulate micro-organisms in the soil to break down or sequester, certain organic pollutants and inorganic pollutants such as nickel in degraded ecosystems, which is known as phytoremediation. In this endophytes may possibly assist plants in converting pollutants into less biologically harmful forms; in one of the few experiments performed a plasmid called TOM from a strain of a bacterium in the Burkholderia genus known as G4 which can break down trichloroethylene (TCE) was transferred to endophytes of popular trees; although it did not help the plants remove more of this chemical than non-inoculated plants, the plants transpired less TCE into the air. In another experiment Burkholderia bacteria with both the TOM plasmid as well as nickel resistance genes was inoculated into yellow lupine; this increased the root mass of the plants, but the amounts of TCE transpired was not statistically significant. Despite these failures, such techniques might lead to some future improvements. Two strains of the endophytic fungi Pestalotiopsis microspora isolated from stems of plants from the Ecuadorian rainforest were shown in laboratory experiments to be able to digest polyurethane plastic as the fungus's sole carbon source in anaerobic conditions, although many other non- endophytic fungi have demonstrated this ability, and most isolates of endophytic fungi in this experiment could perform this to some degree. =Drug discovery= Endophytes can produce a wide variety of compounds that might be useful as lead compounds in drug discovery. Certain fungal endophyte secondary metabolites have useful properties; an example of this is solamargine. Over the years there has been increasing importance placed on the discovery of endophytes natural products, also referred to as bioprospecting. Many of these novel compounds produced by endophytes have been shown to have important medical applications such as antimicrobial, antiparasitic, cytotoxic, neuroprotective, antioxidant, insulin mimetic and immunosuppresant properties. Manipulations of a plant's endosymbiots can affect plant development, growth and ultimately the quality and quantity of compounds harvested from the plant. Studies have shown endophytic fungi are able to produce secondary metabolites that were first thought to be manufactured by plants. The production of these metabolites in plants could either be produced solely by endophytes or have been transferred to or from the host plant genome. A well known example of the discovery of chemicals derived from endophytic fungi is from the fungus Taxomyces andreanae isolated from the pacific yew Taxus brevifolia. T. andreanae produces paclitaxel, also known as taxol. This drug is important for the treatment of cancer. Other endophytes since have been discovered that also produce paclitaxel in other host species, but to date there has been no successful industrial source of paclitaxel created. Endophytes have been discovered with various anti-tumor properties. Endophytic fungi produce many secondary compounds such as alkaloids, triterpenes and steroids which have been shown to have anti-tumor effects. The alkaloid beauvericin has been isolated from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum and has shown cytotoxicity against the tumor cells PC3, PANC-1, and A549. Three triterpenes were found in the endophyte Xylarialean sp., all three of these compounds displayed mild cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Some of the antimicrobial compounds produced by endophytic fungi are of interest in their effectiveness against pathogens which have developed resistances to antibiotics. Several isolates from the ascomycota Pestalotiopsis sp. have been shown to have a broad range of antimicrobial effects, even against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Isolates from the marine fungus Nigrospora sp. have proved to be more effective in treating multi drug-resistant tuberculosis than current treatments. An endophytic fungus of the genus Pseudomassaria has been found in the rainforest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This fungus yields a metabolite that shows potential as an antidiabetic, also known as an insulin mimetic. This compound acts like insulin and has been shown to lower blood glucose levels in mouse model experiments. = Agriculture= Among the many promising applications of endophytic microbes are those intended to increase agricultural use of endophytes to produce crops that grow faster and are more resistant and hardier than crops lacking endophytes. Epichloë endophytes are being widely used commercially in turf grasses to enhance the performance of the turf and its resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Piriformospora indica is an interesting endophytic fungus of the order Sebacinales, the fungus is capable of colonising roots and forming symbiotic relationship with many plants. Endophytes appear to enhance the growth of their plant host symbionts. Endophytes also provide their hosts with an increased resilience to both abiotic and biotic stressors such as drought, poor soils and herbivory. The increased growth and resilience is likely causes by the endophytes ability to improve plant nutrition or secondary metabolite production, as in the case of Phoma eupatoriis inhibition of the phytopathogen Phytophthora infestans. Endophytes accomplish this by increasing the uptake of valuable land limited nutrients from the soil such as phosphorus and making other plant nutrients available to plants such as rock phosphate and atmospheric nitrogen which are normally trapped informs that are inaccessible to plants. Many endophytes protect plants from herbivory from both insects and animals by producing secondary metabolites that are either unappetizing or toxic to the herbivore. Increasingly there has been great importance placed on endophytes that protect valuable crops from invasive insects. One example of an endophyte-plant-insect interaction is located in the New Zealand grasslands, where endophytes, known as AR1 and AR37 are utilized to protect valuable ryegrass from the Argentine stem weevil but remain palatable to another important food source, livestock. There are several endophytes that have been discovered that exhibit insecticidal properties. One such endophyte comes from the Nodulisporium sp. which was first harvested from the plant Bontia daphnoides. Indole diterpenes, known as nodulisporic acids, have been harvested from this endophyte which have effective insecticidal properties against the blowfly larvae. There are many obstacles to successfully implementing the use of endophytes in agriculture. Despite the many known benefits that endophytes may confer to their plant hosts, conventional agricultural practices continue to take priority. Current agriculture relies heavily on fungicides and high levels of chemical fertilizers. The use of fungicides has a negative effect on endophytic fungi and fertilizers reduce a plant's dependence on its endophytic symbiont. Despite this, the interest and use of bio-insecticides and using endophytes to aid in plant growth is increasing as organic and sustainable agriculture is considered more important. As humans become more aware of the damage that synthetic insecticides cause to the environment and beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies biological insecticides may become more important to the agricultural industry.

In Brazil, he also is recognized as a pioneer aviator. Career In 1920 he met Max Delby, a teacher who helped him develop his career, and in April 1921 he flew as a pilot for the first time. =French Air Force= Mermoz joined the French Air Force in 1922, being assigned, as a pilot of the air force's 11th regiment, to duty in Syria. In 1924, he returned to France, having arguably been one of the most successful pilots in the Syrian operations. Mermoz relocated to Toulouse. =Latécoère= The Couzinet 70, \\"Arc-en-Ciel\\", F-AMBV, flown by Mermoz Mermoz went on to become an airmail pilot, with Latécoère's company, and almost failed his entry exam by performing dangerous stunts to impress the director. (The director, Didier Daurat had this famous quote: \\"We don't need acrobats here, we need bus drivers.\\") He then did a normal, flawless flight and was hired. It was there that Mermoz met Antoine de Saint- Exupéry. At the Compagnie Générale Aéropostale, Mermoz travelled to Morocco, Senegal and other African areas. In 1926, one of Mermoz's flights ended with an accident, when his plane crashed in the Sahara. He was then taken hostage by a group of rebel Tuaregs, but was fortunately found later alive. A Latécoère 25 in the Museo Nacional de Aeronáutica de Argentina, in the livery of Aeroposta Argentina In 1927, Latécoère began building his own brand of planes to replace the aging World War I aircraft Breguet 14. The Latécoère 25, (or \\"Laté 25\\") and, later, the Latécoère 26 and Latécoère 28 proved to be efficient aircraft when flying from Morocco to Senegal, and Mermoz himself flew the types on those routes on multiple occasions. But Africa was only the beginning. Latécoère's project was to create a direct airline between France and South America. By 1929, it had become evident that it would be economically viable for France to establish a commercial air route to South America, so Mermoz and others flew over the Andes. Despite Mermoz finding the flying conditions over the Andes to be tough, he became the project's main pilot, determined to reach the Pacific Ocean, and he was able, after multiple stops, to reach Santiago, Chile. During that time, to save time, he decided to fly during the night, using light beacons and flares as guides; and his fellow pilots, for once, were a bit reluctant to see him do it, because they knew it would be their turn next. For some time, as transatlantic flights were not yet possible, steamboats linked both halves of the \\"Line\\". Mermoz, between Victor Etienne and Guillaumet; Río de Janeiro. After flying from Saint-Louis, in Senegal, to Natal, Brazil, in 12–13 May 1930, the line was complete at last. Unfortunately, the modified Laté 28 \\"Comte-de-la-Vaulx\\" did not prove reliable enough, and had to ditch at sea during the return flight. Mermoz, his two companions and the mail were rescued, but the plane sank during the attempt to tow it. =Air France= In 1933, Mermoz was appointed general inspector by Air France. That same year, he arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he and Saint-Exupéry became important persons during the infancy of Aeroposta Argentina, which would later become Aerolíneas Argentinas. Mermoz and Saint- Exupéry flew many dangerous flights for the then new air company. They became regarded as two of the most important men in the history of Argentine commercial aviation. From 1934 to 1936, Mermoz would fly private expeditions on Latécoère 300 airplanes. He flew 24 expeditions with that type. In 1935, he also flew de Havilland DH.88 \\"Comet\\" airplanes. Disappearance at sea Latécoère 300 Croix-du-Sud On 7 December 1936 he turned back shortly after take-off to report a troublesome engine on his Latécoère 300 Croix-du-Sud (Southern Cross). After learning that he would have to wait for another one to be prepared, he took off again in the same plane after a quick repair, concerned that he would be late in delivering the mail. (His last words before boarding the plane were \\"Quick, let's not waste time anymore.\\") Four hours later, the radio station received a short message, where Mermoz reported that he had to cut the power on the aft starboard engine. The message was interrupted abruptly. No further messages were received, and neither the Laté 300 nor the crew were ever recovered. It is assumed that the engine they had tried to repair lost its propeller midflight, and being one of the aft engines, the loose propeller either badly damaged or cut the hull entirely, causing the plane to lose its tail and crash instantly. Henri Guillaumet, one of Mermoz's fellow pilots, had encountered the same problem a few months before, but as his own engine was on the forward side, airspeed had been sufficient to maintain the propeller in place until the landing.  Sabotage of the \\"Southern Cross\\"  In 1941, the Investigative Commission of Anti- National Activities of the Parliament of Uruguay, after denunciations filed before the Deputy Tomas Brena and Julio Iturbide, arrives at the surprising conclusion of the last two airmail flights of Air France, and with result the death of Collenot first and Mermoz later, they were the result of sabotage of the Nazi Fifth Column (National German Socialist Workers Party operating in Uruguay). The air mail bags transported the technical and economic proposals for the bidding of the so-called Obra del Río Negro in Uruguay, the international tender carried out in three calls in 1936, for the construction of the Rincón del Bonete hydroelectric plant. The tender only receives Offers or proposals from the Siemens Bauunion and Philipp Holzmann AG consortium in Germany, and SKODA WORKS from Austria. This and other tricks, such as false news and bribes, were used by Nazi Germany, to get rid of the other proposals under way, and force the bidding to be declared void. The crew of Latécoère 300 Croix-du-Sud, F-AKGF, on that day were: *Jean Mermoz, Pilot *Alexandre Pichodou, Copilot *Henri Ezan, Navigator *Edgar Cruveilher, Radio Officer *Jean Lavidalie, Mechanic =An unreliable plane= Mermoz had grown dissatisfied with the quality of the planes he and his companions had to pilot. In the months before his demise, he had been vocal about the aircraft's poor quality in both design and material, and was quoted saying \\"Ask me to pilot anything, even a wheelbarrow, but at one condition: make sure it is solid\\". A similar plane, Laté 301 F-AOIK Ville-de-Buenos-Aires, had disappeared eight months before his own, causing the death, among others, of his mechanic and friend Collenot. The complicated Hispano-Suiza 12Ner engines thought to be the cause of both crashes were later decommissioned and replaced with older, more reliable ones. His message had been heard too late.

After serving in the Vietnam War and retiring from the military, Gritz has worked on attempted POW rescues in conjunction with the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. Gritz ran for United States president under the Populist Party in 1992. Gritz ran in 1992 under the slogan: \\"God, Guns and Gritz,\\" and published an isolationist political manifesto titled \\"The Bill of Gritz\\".Newell G. Bringhurst and Craig L Foster (2008). The Mormon Quest for the Presidency (Ann Arbor, Mich.: John Whitmer Books, ) pp. 208–226. Gritz lives in Sandy Valley, Nevada and has four children. Early life Gritz was born on January 18, 1939, in Enid, Oklahoma. His father served in the Army Air Force in World War II and was killed in action. He was raised by his maternal grandparents on patriotic stories of his father's heroics in the war. After being expelled from the local high school, Gritz attended and graduated from Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia. = Military service = He enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 20, 1957, and shortly thereafter attended Officer Candidate School (OCS). He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1963, and to major in 1967. As a lieutenant colonel in Vietnam, he commanded detachment \\"B-36\\", U.S. Army Special Forces 5th SFG for a time. B-36 was a mixed American and South Vietnamese unit that operated in the III Corps area of Southern South Vietnam. He served in a variety of assignments, including commanding Special Forces in Latin America 1975–77, as a Desk Officer for the Middle East, and Chief of Congressional Relations for the Defense Security Agency (International Security Affairs) in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (1977–79) until his retirement in 1979 at the rank of lieutenant colonel. General Westmoreland in his memoir, A Soldier Reports, cites Bo Gritz as \\"The\\" American Soldier. Gritz received an array of military awards, and some of these have been called into question. A memo regarding his awards and award recommendations during his time in Vietnam seems to indicate that Gritz was personally involved with the recommendation of some of his medals, including the Legion of Merit, and that some of his awards recommendations cited the same missions and incidents, effectively awarding Gritz multiple medals for the same missions, including the Legion of Merit, Air Medal, Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Army Commendation Medal.  Post-war activities  = Attempts to locate prisoners of war = During the 1980s Gritz undertook a series of private trips into Southeast Asia, purportedly to locate United States prisoners of war which as part of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue some believed were still being held by Laos and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, e.g., at Nhommarath. Those missions were heavily publicized, controversial and widely decried as haphazard, for instance, as some commentators stated, few successful secret missions involve bringing to the border towns women openly selling commemorative POW-rescue T-shirts. In the book Inside Delta Force, CSM Eric L. Haney, a former Delta Force operator, claims that the unit was twice told to prepare for a mission involving the rescue of American POWs from Vietnam. However, both times the missions were scrubbed, according to Haney, when Gritz suddenly appeared in the spotlight, drawing too much attention to the issue and making the missions too difficult to accomplish. = U.S. government involvement in drug trafficking = In 1986, after a trip to Burma (now Myanmar) to interview drug kingpin Khun Sa regarding possible locations of U.S. POWs, Gritz returned from Burma with a videotaped interview of Khun Sa purporting to name several officials in the Reagan administration involved in narcotics trafficking in Southeast Asia. Among those named was Richard Armitage, who most recently served as Deputy Secretary of State during George W. Bush's first term as president. Footage, also shot by a film team for Italian television, produced and directed by Patrick King and Tudor Gates in Burma, features in a new documentary \\"Erase and Forget.\\" Gritz believed that those same officials were involved in a coverup of missing American POWs. During this period Gritz established contacts with the Christic Institute, a progressive group which was then pursuing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over charges of drug trafficking in both Southeast Asia and Central America. = Conspiracy theorist = In 1989, Gritz established the Center For Action, which was active on a number of issues, mostly pertaining to conspiracy theories. Attempting to build bridges among conspiracy theorists and other activists of both the left and right, in 1990 he held a conference in Las Vegas, Nevada called \\"Freedom Call '90\\". Speakers at that conference included October Surprise conspiracy theory researcher Barbara Honegger, Bill Davis of the Christic Institute, writer Eustace Mullins, and several others. This newfound interest in conspiracy theories proved to be as controversial as Gritz's earlier missions searching for POWs. = Anti-war activism = During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Gritz was an opponent of the war, and linked it to a conspiracy theory alleging plans to implement a one-world government, known as the \\"New World Order.\\" He appeared on Pacifica Radio stations in California as a guest several times, and for a short time was in demand as a speaker to left-wing and anti-war audiences. However, during this period he also became closely associated with the Christian Patriot movement on the right, and spoke at conferences sponsored by Christian Identity pastor Pete Peters. When these associations became known to those on the left, especially after the publication of a report by the Los Angeles-based group People Against Racist Terror calling Gritz a \\"front man for fascism\\", left-wing audiences lost interest in Gritz, and the Christic Institute and Pacifica Radio cut off any further association. He has since distanced himself from the movement. = Writings = Gritz is the author of three books. The first, A Nation Betrayed, was published in 1989 and contained Gritz's allegations of drug trafficking and a POW coverup, based on the Khun Sa interview. The second, Called To Serve, was published in 1992 and expanded on the previous book to cover a wide range of conspiracies, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and allegations of a conspiracy to establish a new world order. His third book is titled My Brother's Keeper and was published in 2003. = Populist Party presidential tickets = In 1988, Gritz was the candidate for Vice President of the United States on the Populist Party ticket; initially, unbeknownst to him, he was billed as the running mate of former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke. Gritz pulled out early in the race and publicly distanced himself from Duke and ran instead for a Nevada Congressional seat. Gritz was then replaced by Floyd Parker on some ballots. Gritz has claimed that he accepted the party's nomination in the belief that he would be the running mate of James Traficant. Shortly after meeting Duke, Gritz wrote that Duke was \\"a brash, untraveled, overly opinionated, bigoted young man\\" and that \\"I will not support anyone that I know to hate any class of Americans.\\"Gritz, Bo. https://web.archive.org/web/19980130011925/http://www.bogritz.com/lw/nokidnap.html In 1992, after failing to secure the U.S. Taxpayers' Party's nomination, Gritz ran for President of the United States, again with the Populist Party. Under the campaign slogan \\"God, Guns and Gritz\\" and publishing his political manifesto \\"The Bill of Gritz\\" (playing on his last name rhyming with \\"rights\\"), he called for staunch opposition to what he called \\"global government\\" and the \\"New World Order\\", ending all foreign aid, and abolishing the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve System. During the campaign, Gritz openly proclaimed the United States to be a \\"Christian Nation\\", stating that the country's legal statutes \\"should reflect unashamed acceptance of Almighty God and His Laws.\\" He received 106,152 votes nationwide, or only 0.14 percent of the popular vote. In two states he had a respectable showing for a third party candidate: Utah, where he received 3.84 percent of the vote and Idaho, where he received 2.13 percent of the vote. In Duchesne CountyOur Campaigns; UT US Presidential Election November 03, 1992 and Oneida County, Idaho,Our Campaigns; ID US Presidential Election, November 03, 1992 his support topped ten percent, whilst in Franklin County, Idaho, Gritz received over twelve percent and was only 23 votes away from pushing Bill Clinton into fourth place – which has not happened to a major party nominee in any county nationwide since 1916. His run on the Populist Party ticket was prompted by his association with another far-right political Christian talk radio host, Tom Valentine. During his presidential run, part of Gritz's standard stump speech was an idea to pay off the National debt by minting a coin at the Treasury and sending it to the Federal Reserve. This predates the 2012 trillion-dollar coin concept. Among other things, the \\"Bill of Gritz\\" called for the complete closing of the border with Mexico, and the dissolution of the Federal Reserve System. Also during 1992, Gritz attracted national attention as mediator during the government standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Gerry Spence was asked by Gritz to defend Weaver, and in turn defended his action to do so in a letter to Alan Hirschfield, the former chairman of chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox.http://famous- trials.com/rubyridge/1143-spenceletter?cn=bWVzc2FnZQ%3D%3D&refsrc;=email Controversies In 1993, Gritz changed his emphasis again and began offering a course called SPIKE (Specially Prepared Individuals for Key Events), where those events oppose the New World Order, which taught paramilitary and survivalist skills because he predicted that there would be a total sociopolitical and economic collapse in the U.S. He also established a community in Kamiah, Idaho (contiguous to the Nez Perce people) called Almost Heaven. Several times he used his influence and reputation in the Christian Patriot community in attempts to negotiate conclusions between legal authorities and far-right activists. In August 1992, he intervened on behalf of Randy Weaver who, with his family, was living at his rural home at Ruby Ridge, after U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest him for failure to appear in court. The 11-day standoff, which resulted in the deaths of a U.S. Marshal and Weaver's son and wife, ended after Gritz convinced Weaver to leave his cabin and place his faith and trust in the court system. In 1996, he unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a conclusion to the stand-off by the Montana Freemen, a group of Christian Patriot activists who were wanted on an assortment of charges. After speaking with the Freemen, he left in frustration, stating that they presented him with what he called \\"legal mumbo-jumbo\\" to support their claims, and cautioned others in the Patriot movement not to support them. The stand-off ended when the Freemen surrendered after 81 days. While he was married to Judy Kirsch, who was a Christian Identity follower, he was accused of supporting the Christian Identity ideology, in which whites of European descent can be traced back to the \\"Lost Tribes of Israel.\\" In this ideology, many consider Jews to be the Satanic offspring of Eve and the Serpent, while non-whites are \\"mud peoples\\" created before Adam and Eve. He has been accused of white supremacy by some, although he denounced the belief in an interview with The Militia Watchdog, saying \\"I've served with black, white, yellow, brown, red; all religions; nobody ever asked you about your religion, your blood bleeds red the same as everyone else.\\" As well, Gritz openly denounced racism during his \\"Spike\\" training courses, and welcomed all who wanted to join in the training, regardless of race.  Later life  = Subsequent activities = In 1998, Gritz organized a fruitless search for the Centennial Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph in order to save Rudolph's life. In 2005, Gritz became an active protester for intervention in the Terri Schiavo case. On 19 March 2005, when her feeding tube was removed, he was arrested for trespassing after trying to enter the hospice where she lived. Beginning in 2014, Gritz has hosted a radio show on Americanvoiceradio.com known as Freedom Call. It is broadcast weekdays at 5 p.m. EST.Americanvoiceradio.com = Involvement with Mormonism = In 1984, Gritz and his wife Claudia were baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). However, amid infidelity scandals, Gritz's stake president refused to renew Gritz's temple recommend until Gritz could prove that he had paid federal income tax.\\"Radicalized Prophets of the Far, Far Right\\", Sunstone, Oct. 2003, p. 39. In response, Gritz resigned his membership in the LDS Church. In 1999, Gritz and his then fourth wife Judy became involved in the Church of Israel, a group that originated within the Latter Day Saint movement and has become involved with the Christian Identity movement, from which he has now distanced himself. In popular culture The character of John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith on the 1980s television series The A-Team was loosely based on Gritz. In the early 1980s, actor William Shatner paid almost $15,000 for the entertainment rights to Gritz's life story.Pico Iyer, \\"Colonel Gritz's Dubious Mission\\", Time, 1983-04-04. Gritz's community Almost Heaven featured in the episode \\"Survivalists\\" of Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends in 1998, produced for BBC2. In 2017, the documentary Erase and Forget was released. Filmmaker Andrea Luka Zimmerman followed Gritz for more than 10 years. The film shows him at gun shows and re-enacting scenes from his life. The Guardian wrote that the film \\"tell[s] Gritz's story and explore[s] the deep bonds between Hollywood's fictionalised conflicts and America's hidden wars\\" and said that, aside from a biographical documentary, the film is also \\"an essay on the historic causes of America's deep disillusionment with its own government.\\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6075734/ In the 1996 TV movie 'Ruby Ridge: An American Tragedy'/'Siege at Ruby Ridge', Gritz is portrayed by actor Bob Gunton In the 2018 Paramount miniseries Waco, Gritz is portrayed by actor Vic Browder. \\"Waco (TV Mini-Series 2018)-Cast-IMDb\\" Decorations and medals The following is based largely on photographs of Lieutenant Colonel Gritz in which he is wearing military awards and can not be independently verified. =Badges and tabs= * Combat Infantryman Badge * Master Parachutist Badge * Pathfinder Badge * SCUBA Diver Badge * Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge * Special Forces Tab * Ranger Tab =United States Decorations= * Silver Star with two oak leaf clusters * Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster * Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster * Soldier's Medal * Bronze Star Medal with \\"V\\" device and six oak leaf clusters * Purple Heart * Defense Meritorious Service Medal * Meritorious Service Medal * Air Medal with \\"V\\" device and 25 oak leaf clusters * Joint Service Commendation Medal * Army Commendation Medal with \\"V\\" device and three oak leaf clusters =Unit awards= * Presidential Unit Citation * Meritorious Unit Commendation =United States service medals= * Army Good Conduct Medal * National Defense Service Medal * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal * Vietnam Service Medal with five campaign stars =International orders, decorations and medals= * Republic of Vietnam Parachutist Badge * Knight, National Order of Vietnam * Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with palm * Vietnam Armed Forces Honor Medal, 1st Class * Vietnam Civil Actions Medal, 1st Class * Vietnam Wound Medal * Vietnam Cross of Gallantry Unit Award with palm * Vietnam Civil Actions Unit Award with palm * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal * Gold Medal of Cambodia =State Award= * New York Conspicuous Service Cross References External links * Erase and Forget: new documentary reveals life story of the real Rambo. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/13/erase-and-forget-documentary-bo- gritz * * Gerry Spence: Bo Gritz asked him to defend Randy Weaver, and why he chose to do it. http://famous- trials.com/rubyridge/1143-spenceletter?cn=bWVzc2FnZQ%3D%3D&refsrc;=email * Ruby Ridge, 1992: the day the American militia movement was born. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/26/ruby-ridge-1992-modern- american-militia-charlottesville * * http://theamericanvoice.com * http://www.hydeparkmedia.com/gritz.html  \\"A Warrior Brought Down By Love\\", Text & Photos By Anthony DeBartolo – Chicago Tribune, January 1, 1999 - Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American activists Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American University alumni Category:Christian Identity Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:Former Latter Day Saints Category:Members of the United States Army Special Forces Category:Military personnel from Enid, Oklahoma Category:Nevada Constitutionalists Category:People from Kamiah, Idaho Category:Politicians from Enid, Oklahoma Category:Populist Party (United States, 1984) politicians Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Soldier's Medal Category:United States Army officers Category:Candidates in the 1992 United States presidential election Category:American anti-war activists Category:Vietnam War POW/MIA activists ","title":"Bo Gritz"},{"id":"889906","text":"The Lukina Jama–Trojama cave system.

The range forms a part of the Dinaric Alps and is located along the Adriatic coast, separating it from Lika in the interior. Velebit begins in the northwest near Senj with the Vratnik mountain pass and ends 145 km to the southeast near the source of the Zrmanja river northwest of Knin. Its highest peak is the Vaganski vrh at 1,757 m. Major mountain passes on Velebit include the aforementioned Vratnik or Senjsko bilo at 694 m.a.s.l., where the Josephina connects Senj with Josipdol; Oštarijska vrata at 928 m.a.s.l. that connects Karlobag and Gospić; and Prezid at 766 m.a.s.l. that connects Obrovac and Gračac. The important characteristic of Velebit is its simple, solid form, stiff cliffs, and the nakedness of seaward side and the wood-covered slopes of the Lika side. The basic geological characteristic of the mountains is karst; flora and fauna are abundant. The whole mountain range is protected as nature park, and the most popular spots on Velebit are: the peak of Vučjak (1,644 m) above Zavižan, the botanical gardens and caves, Hajdučki and Rožanski kukovi, Štirovača, the Northern Velebit National Park and the Paklenica National Park.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 140–141, Zagreb (1999), The Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service has a permanent measurement station at Zavižan. The regions The middle part of Velebit A farm near the valley by the Velebit mountain Velebit is usually divided into four regions: * the northern part between the mountain passes Vratnik and Veliki Alan, with the highest peak Mali Rajinac (1699 m) * the middle part between Veliki Alan and Baške Oštarije with the highest peak Šatorina (1624 m) * the southern part between Oštarije and Mali Alan (peaks Vaganski vrh – 1757, Sveto brdo – 1753,) * the southeastern part with Crnopac as the most remarkable peak The back side of the Velebit mountain. Velebit as a whole is a nature park, from which two national parks have been carved out: Paklenica and Sjeverni Velebit (Northern Velebit) A further category of even more careful nature preservation exists within Sjeverni Velebit, the special reservation Hajdučki i Rožanski Kukovi, under the highest nature protection available in Croatia. Officially no human activity is allowed there (except research). These are the mostly still unexplored and wild places and probably will stay that way in the future. A pathway called Premužićeva staza (Premužić's pathway) leads through the northern and middle parts of Velebit. This pathway was built between 1930 and 1933 and it connects northern and southern Velebit. Its length is . Many parts of Velebit would not be reachable without it.

The caves  Typical Velebit landscape There are hundreds of \\"holes\\" on Velebit. It has the largest and deepest caves in Croatia. The three-part \\"Lukina jama\\" cave is 1392 m deep, making it one of the deepest caves in the world, and the deepest in southeast Europe, while the \\"Slovačka jama\\" is 1320 m. What makes it unique is that it is completely vertical, steepest in the world. At the bottom of the pothole is a water course or siphon with branches that are still unexplored. A kind of leech was discovered in the pothole, which has been ascertained to represent a new species, genus and family; it has been named Erpobdella mestrovi.

He held the rank of colonel in the British Indian Army and was frequently called upon by the Government of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, now the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, to kill man- eating tigers and leopards that were preying on people in the nearby villages of the Kumaon-Garhwal Regions. He authored Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Jungle Lore, and other books recounting his hunts and experiences, which enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success. He became an avid photographer and spoke out for the need to protect India's wildlife from extermination. Early life Corbett was born of British ancestry in the town of Nainital in the Kumaon of the Himalaya (now in the Indian state of Uttarakhand). He grew up in a large family of sixteen children and was the eighth child of Christopher William Corbett and his wife Mary Jane (née Prussia) who had previously married Dr Charles James Doyle of Agra, who died at Etawah in 1857.Booth:20–26. His parents had moved to Nainital in 1862, after Christopher Corbett had quit military service and been appointed the town's postmaster.Booth:20. In winters the family used to move to the foothills, where they owned a cottage named \\"Arundel\\" in the village now known as Kaladhungi. Corbett House at Corbett Museum, Kaladhungi, Uttarakhand Mary Jane was very influential in Nainital social life among Europeans and she became a kind of real estate agent for European settlers.Booth:29. Christopher William retired from the position of postmaster in 1878. He died a few weeks after a heart attack on 21 April 1881. Jim was then aged six and his eldest brother Tom took over as postmaster of Nainital. From a very early age, Jim was fascinated by the forests and wildlife around his home in Kaladhungi. Through frequent excursions, he learned to identify most animals and birds by their calls. Over time he became a good tracker and hunter. He studied at Oak Openings School, which merged with Philander Smith College in Nainital (later known as Halett War School, and now known as Birla Vidya Mandir, Nainital). Before he was nineteen he quit school and found employment with the Bengal and North Western Railway, initially working as a fuel inspector at Manakpur in the Punjab, and subsequently as a contractor for the trans-shipment of goods across the Ganges at Mokameh Ghat in Bihar.Kala, D. C. (1979) Jim Corbett of Kumaon. Ankur Publishing House, New Delhi Hunting man-eating tigers and leopards During his life Corbett tracked and shot a number of leopards and Tigers; about a dozen were well documented Man-eaters. Corbett provided estimates of human casualties in his books, including Man-Eaters of Kumaon, The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag, and The Temple Tiger, and More Man-Eaters of Kumaon. Calculating the totals from these accounts, these big cats had killed more than 1,200 men, women, and children, according to Corbett. There are some discrepancies in the official human death tolls that the British and Indian governments have on record and Corbett's estimates. The first designated man- eating tiger he killed, the Champawat Tiger, was responsible for an estimated 436 documented deaths.Tiger and leopard attacks in Nepal BBC News (11 July 2012) Though most of his kills were tigers, Corbett successfully killed at least two-man-eating leopards. The first was the Panar Leopard in 1910, which allegedly killed 400 people. The second was the man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag in 1926, which terrorized the pilgrims on the holy Hindu shrines Kedarnath and Badrinath for more than eight years, and was said to be responsible for more than 126 deaths. Other notable man-eaters he killed were the Talla-Des man-eater, the Mohan man-eater, the Thak man-eater, the Muktesar man-eater and the Chowgarh tigress. Analysis of carcasses, skulls, and preserved remains show that most of the man-eaters were suffering from disease or wounds, such as porcupine quills embedded deep in the skin or gunshot wounds that had not healed, like that of the Muktesar Man-Eater. The Thak man- eating tigress, when skinned by Corbett, revealed two old gunshot wounds; one in her shoulder had become septic, and could have been the reason for the tigress's having turned man-eater, Corbett suggested. In the foreword of Man Eaters of Kumaon, Corbett writes: > The wound that has caused a particular tiger to take to man-eating might be > the result of a carelessly fired shot and failure to follow up and recover > the wounded animal, or be the result of the tiger having lost his temper > while killing a porcupine Corbett preferred to hunt alone and on foot when pursuing dangerous game. He often hunted with Robin, a small dog he wrote about in Man-Eaters of Kumaon.Rangarajan, M. (2006) India's Wildlife History: An Introduction. Permanent Black and Ranthambore Foundation, Delhi. . Hunter and naturalist Corbett bought his first camera in the late 1920s and—inspired by his friend Frederick Walter Champion—started to record tigers on cine film. Although he had an intimate knowledge of the jungle, it was a demanding task to obtain good pictures, as the animals were exceedingly shy. A popular misconception is that Corbett never killed a tiger without confirmation of its killing people.Thapar, V. (2001) Savings Wild Tigers: the essential writings. Permanent Black, Delhi. For example, Corbett killed the unusually large and most widely sought after Bachelor of Powalgarh, even though this tiger had never killed a human.Corbett, J. (1944) Man-Eaters of Kumaon. Oxford University Press. Together with Champion, he played a key role in establishing India's first national park in the Kumaon Hills, the Hailey National Park, initially named after Lord Malcolm Hailey. The park was renamed in Corbett's honour in 1957. While dedicating his book My India to \\"...my friends, the poor of India\\", he writes \\"It is of these people, who are admittedly poor, and who are often described as 'India's starving millions', among whom I have lived and whom I love, that I shall endeavor to tell in the pages of this book, which I humbly dedicate to my friends, the poor of India.\\" Retirement in Kenya Jim Corbett resided in the Gurney House along with his sister Maggie Corbett. They sold the house to Mrs. Kalavati Varma, before leaving for Kenya in November 1947. The house has been transformed into a museum and is known as the Jim Corbett Museum. Jim also spent a short time in Chotti Haldwani, a village he had adopted and which came to be known as Corbett's Village. Corbett and the villagers built a wall around the village in 1925 to keep wild animals out of the premises. As of 2018 the wall still stands, and according to villagers has prevented wild animal attacks on villagers since it was built. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-this-nainital-village- corbett-s-great-wall-stands-between-villagers-and- tigers/story-F2VQSPiCZRPu4ZidN3zbbL.html After 1947, Corbett and his sister Maggie retired to Nyeri, Kenya, where he lived in the cottage 'Paxtu' in the grounds of the Hotel Outspan, which had originally been built for his friend Lord Baden-Powell. He continued to write and sound the alarm about declining numbers of wild cats and other wildlife. Corbett was at the Treetops, a hut built on the branches of a giant ficus tree, as the bodyguard of Princess Elizabeth when she stayed there on 5–6 February 1952. That night, her father, King George VI died, and Elizabeth ascended to the throne. Corbett wrote in the hotel's visitors' register: > For the first time in the history of the world, a young girl climbed into a > tree one day a Princess, and after having what she described as her most > thrilling experience, she climbed down from the tree the next day a > Queen—God bless her. Corbett died of a heart attack a few days after he finished his sixth book, Tree Tops, and was buried at St. Peter's Anglican Church in Nyeri. His memories were kept intact in the form of the meeting place Moti House, which Corbett had built for his friend Moti Singh, and the Corbett Wall, a long wall (approximately ) built around the village to protect crops from wild animals. Man-eaters of Kumaon was a great success in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the first edition of the American Book-of-the-Month Club being 250,000 copies. It was later translated into 27 languages. Corbett's fourth book, Jungle Lore, is considered his autobiography. The Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, India was renamed in his honour in 1957. He had played a key role in establishing this protected area in the 1930s. In 1968, one of the five remaining subspecies of tigers was named after him: Panthera tigris corbetti, the Indochinese tiger, also called Corbett's tiger. In 1994 and 2002, the long-neglected graves of Corbett and his sister (both in Kenya) were repaired and restored by Jerry A. Jaleel, founder and director of the Jim Corbett Foundation.Jaleel, J.A. (2009) The Jim Corbett Foundation, Canada  Personal life  Corbett remained unmarried in life. =Hollywood movie= In 1948, in the wake of Man-Eaters of Kumaons success, a Hollywood film, Man- Eater of Kumaon, was made, directed by Byron Haskin and starring Sabu, Wendell Corey and Joe Page. The film did not follow any of Corbett's stories; a new story was invented. The film was a flop, although some interesting footage of the tiger was filmed. Corbett is known to have said that \\"the best actor was the tiger\\".Martin Booth, Carpet Sahib; A Life of Jim Corbett (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 230. 'Corbett Legacy' was produced by the Uttarakhand Forest Department and directed by Bedi Brothers which carried original footage shot by Corbett. =Other adaptations= In 1986, the BBC produced a docudrama titled Man-Eaters of India with Frederick Treves in the role of Jim Corbett. An IMAX movie India: Kingdom of the Tiger, based on Corbett's books, was made in 2002 starring Christopher Heyerdahl as Corbett. A TV movie based on The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag starring Jason Flemyng was made in 2005. Honours Corbett received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in the 1928 New Year Honours. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in the King's 1946 Birthday Honours. =Items named in honour of Jim Corbett's life and work= * A reserve area known as Hailey National Park covering 323.75 km2 (125.00 sq mi) was created in 1936, when Sir Malcolm Hailey was the Governor of United Provinces; and Asia's first national park came into existence. The reserve was renamed in 1954–55 as Ramganga National Park and was again renamed in 1955–56 as Jim Corbett National Park. * Indochinese tiger was named after Jim Corbett in 1968 by Vratislav Mazak who was the first to describe the new subspecies of the tiger living in Southeast Asia Books Jim Corbett with the slain Bachelor of Powalgarh. * Jungle Stories.

He was one of the first film cameramen to work seriously in the field of television in the UK, which for much of its early period almost exclusively employed electronic cameras. Englander was born in London during a First World War Zeppelin raid, and during the 1930s came to be referred to by his initials \\"AA\\" due to the unsavory connections between his first name and that of Adolf Hitler, and his dislike for the middle name. He was also often referred to by the nickname \\"Tubby\\". He began his career after leaving school at the age of fifteen in 1930, and initially worked in the film industry at the Stoll Film Studios in Cricklewood. Here he worked first as a clapper boy, then during the course of the decade worked his way up to become magazine loader and then an assistant cameraman. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he joined the Royal Fusiliers, but was quickly seconded to the army's film unit, making documentary and propaganda films. After the end of the war in 1945 he continued working in documentaries until he joined BBC Television in 1952, becoming one of the Corporation's few film cameramen. At the time, film was mainly used by the BBC for shooting documentaries, news reports and short external scenes for dramas and other programmes, with the majority of programming being transmitted live from electronic video cameras. It was the acquisition of staff of Englander's talent that increased the use of film at the BBC, and in 1956 the Corporation also acquired the Ealing Studios complex, which it turned into a dedicated studio for making inserts for television programmes, and eventually entire programmes themselves, on film. Englander worked on film inserts for highly prestigious BBC dramas such as Rudolph Cartier's Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59) and Anna Karenina (1961), and later programmes such as Doctor Who, Dad's Army, Colditz and Maigret. Even after the era of live television had passed in the early 1960s, the BBC still shot the majority of its fiction programmes on videotape, with film inserts used only for location material and difficult-to-shoot sequences, until the late 1980s. He also worked on highly prestigious all-film documentary series such as Civilisation (1969) and Alistair Cooke's America (1973). BBC regulations stipulate that all employees must retire at sixty, and Englander was reluctantly forced to comply with this rule in 1975. Following his retirement from the Corporation he worked for some time as a freelance lighting cameraman. In the early 1970s, he co-wrote the book Filming for Television with Paul Petzold (published 1976, Focal Press, London). He died at the age of eighty-nine of natural causes.

Description Khao Yai National Park is in the western part of the Sankamphaeng Mountain Range, at the southwestern boundary of the Khorat Plateau. The highest mountain in the area of the park is high Khao Rom. This park lies largely in Nakhon Ratchasima Province (Khorat), but also includes parts of Saraburi, Prachinburi, and Nakhon Nayok Provinces. The park is the third largest in Thailand. It covers an area of 2,168 square kilometers, including tropical seasonal forests and grasslands. Elevations mostly range from . There are 3,000 species of plants, 320 species of birds like red junglefowl and coral-billed ground cuckoo, and 66 species of mammals, including Asian black bear, Indian elephant, gaur, gibbon, Indian sambar deer, southern pig-tailed macaque, Indian muntjac, Ussuri dhole, and wild pig. There are no tigers in Khao Yai, and there have not been any for at least 20 years. Its waterfalls include the Heo Narok, and Heo Suwat made famous from the film The Beach. Recent wildlife studies show that animal ranges, particularly the few resident tigers, are impacted by human activity near the center of the park. History Around 1922 some people from Ban Tha Dan and Ban Tha Chai villages in Nakhon Nayok Province built a settlement within the forest in the Sankamphaeng mountains. Up to 30 households cultivated the land. The area was formally recognized by the government and classified as Tambon Khao Yai within Pak Phli District. However, due to its remoteness from the authorities it became a refuge for criminals and fugitives. After an attempt to capture the suspects in the area, in 1932 the villagers were relocated into the plains some 30 km away and the tambon status was cancelled. In 1959 the prime minister, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of the Interior to create a process whereby national parks could be established. Nong Pak Chee grassland Khao Yai National Park was then established on 18 September 1962, declared by royal proclamation in the Government Gazette (Book 79, Section 89) as the first national park in Thailand. A major role in its establishment was played by Boonsong Lekakul, one of the 20th century's most famous Thai conservationists. It was named after the defunct tambon, Khao Yai. In 1984 the park was made an ASEAN Heritage Park, and on 14 July 2005 the park, together with other parks in the same range and in the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains further north, was proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name \\"Dong Phaya Yen–Khao Yai Forest Complex\\". As the lands adjacent to the national park are becoming increasingly developed into luxury hotels and golf courses, acquiring land for future wildlife conservation efforts is becoming problematic. Homes and residential villas have been built illegally within the limits of the protected area of the forest. Illegal logging is also a problem in the area of the park. Visitors According to the Department of National Parks (DNP), which manages the park, visitors to Khao Yai have risen from 671,569 in 2008 to more than 1.2 million in FY2016. From October 2015 to September 2016, 471,514 vehicles entered the park. The congestion has led to demands to close the park to private vehicles. During one of its busiest periods, New Year's week from 30 December – 3 January 2016, the park saw 156,574 visitors. They left in excess of 23 tonnes of waste behind. As litter was a serious problem at the park, in 2020 the park started mailing litter to the homes of visitors who left it there. Climate Dhole feeding on a sambar carcass, Khao Yai Khao Yai National Park has three main seasons, with an annual mean temperature of 23° Celsius, though this varies greatly with the seasons. *Rainy season (May–October): Most days have high rates of precipitation. The atmosphere is humid with average temperatures of 27 °C during the day dropping to 13 °C at night. Streams at peak flow. *Cool season (November–February): Clear skies, sunny and cool. Average temperatures of 22 °C during the day and 10 °C at night. Good time for hiking. *Hot season (March–April): Humid with daytime temperatures of 20–30 °C and 17 °C at night. Geology Pha Diao Dai (\\"Lonely Cliff\\") Limestone is present towards the eastern end close to the Dângrêk Mountains. Sandstone outcrops exist in the south and north of the park. Shales and schist are also present. In the south, steep slopes made of granite and conglomerates are seen. Drainage There are four drainage areas in the park which are vital catchments for four river systems. The Lam Takhong River drains from the central Khao Yai area and runs in a northeasterly direction to the Mekong. The Sai Yai River system drains from the eastern basin, turning sharply into the southern floodplains and on to the Gulf of Thailand. The Nakhon Nayok River system drains from the southwest watershed into Nakhon Nayok Province to the south. The Saraburi Province drainage system drains westward from the far west of Khao Yai. Fauna Khao Yai is home to a variety of animals. It is one of the few places in Thailand where wild elephants still survive. They are regularly seen and are a major tourist attraction. Other larger animals include gibbons, pig-tailed macaques, muntjacs and sambar deer. In early-2017 it was announced that 18 tigers, including five males, seven female and six cubs, were filmed by surveillance cameras in the Dong Phaya Yen-Khao Yai world heritage site in June 2016 and February 2017 in a joint effort of the Department of National Parks, the Freeland Foundation, and the Panthera Corporation. The last time that tigers were seen by surveillance cameras in Khao Yai National Park was in 2002.

Biography Born in London, he was a son of immigrant Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti and his wife Frances Rossetti née Polidori, and the brother of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Georgina Rossetti. He was one of the seven founder members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848, and became the movement's unofficial organizer and bibliographer. He edited the Brotherhood's literary magazine The Germ which published four issues in 1850 and wrote the poetry reviews for it. It was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848: #To have genuine ideas to express; #To study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them; #To sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote; #And most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.Rossetti, William Michael. _Dante Gabriel Rossetti. His Family-Letters with a Memoir_. (London: Ellis, 1895), p. 135. (http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/pr5246.a43.rad.html) Although Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from Algernon Swinburne to James McNeill Whistler. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle John William Polidori (author of The Vampyre and physician to Lord Byron), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti. Rossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of Walt Whitman, which was published in 1868; however, this edition was bowdlerized. Anne Gilchrist, who became one of the first to write about Whitman, first read his poetry from Rossetti's edition, and Rossetti helped initiate their correspondence. In 1874 he married Lucy Madox Brown, daughter of the painter Ford Madox Brown. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, Olivia Frances Madox, was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne's. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Their son Michael died in infancy. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of Ezra Pound, and the two corresponded frequently. Gabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904. William Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic art historians, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on Fra Angelico demonstrating his literary and art-historical style. > The \\"pietistic\\" quality of Fra Angelico's work is in fact its predominant > characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, > devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely > attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk > of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the > hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work. > Even so, Fra Angelico is a notable artist within his sphere... .

It is a particular kind of Toeplitz matrix. In numerical analysis, circulant matrices are important because they are diagonalized by a discrete Fourier transform, and hence linear equations that contain them may be quickly solved using a fast Fourier transform.Davis, Philip J., Circulant Matrices, Wiley, New York, 1970 They can be interpreted analytically as the integral kernel of a convolution operator on the cyclic group C_n and hence frequently appear in formal descriptions of spatially invariant linear operations. In cryptography, a circulant matrix is used in the MixColumns step of the Advanced Encryption Standard. Definition An n\\\\times n circulant matrix C takes the form : C= \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_0 & c_{n-1} & \\\\dots & c_{2} & c_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1} & c_0 & c_{n-1} & & c_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & c_{1}& c_0 & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{n-2} & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & c_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{n-1} & c_{n-2} & \\\\dots & c_{1} & c_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} or the transpose of this form (by choice of notation). A circulant matrix is fully specified by one vector, c, which appears as the first column (or row) of C. The remaining columns (and rows, resp.) of C are each cyclic permutations of the vector c with offset equal to the column (or row, resp.) index, if lines are indexed from 0 to n-1. (Cyclic permutation of rows has the same effect as cyclic permutation of columns.) The last row of C is the vector c in reverse order, and the remaining rows are each cyclic permutations of the last row. Different sources define the circulant matrix in different ways, for example as above, or with the vector c corresponding to the first row rather than the first column of the matrix; and possibly with a different direction of shift (which is sometimes called an anti-circulant matrix). The polynomial f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \\\\dots + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} is called the associated polynomial of matrix C.  Properties  = Eigenvectors and eigenvalues = The normalized eigenvectors of a circulant matrix are the Fourier modes, namely, :v_j=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} (1, \\\\omega^j, \\\\omega^{2j}, \\\\ldots, \\\\omega^{(n-1)j}),\\\\quad j= 0, 1,\\\\ldots, n-1, where \\\\omega=\\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{2\\\\pi i}{n}\\\\right) is a primitive n-th root of unity and i is the imaginary unit. (This can be understood by realizing that a circulant matrix implements a convolution.) The corresponding eigenvalues are then given by :\\\\lambda_j = c_0+c_{n-1} \\\\omega^j + c_{n-2} \\\\omega^{2j} + \\\\ldots + c_{1} \\\\omega^{(n-1)j}, \\\\qquad j=0,1,\\\\ldots, n-1. = Determinant = As a consequence of the explicit formula for the eigenvalues above, the determinant of a circulant matrix can be computed as: : \\\\det(C) = \\\\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (c_0 + c_{n-1} \\\\omega^j + c_{n-2} \\\\omega^{2j} + \\\\dots + c_1\\\\omega^{(n-1)j}). Since taking the transpose does not change the eigenvalues of a matrix, an equivalent formulation is : \\\\det(C)=\\\\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (c_0 + c_1 \\\\omega^j + c_2 \\\\omega^{2j} + \\\\dots + c_{n-1}\\\\omega^{(n-1)j}) = \\\\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} f(\\\\omega^j). = Rank = The rank of a circulant matrix C is equal to n - d , where d is the degree of the polynomial \\\\gcd( f(x), x^n - 1) . = Other properties = * We have :: C=c_0I+c_1P+c_2P^2+\\\\ldots+c_{n-1}P^{n-1}=f(P). :where P is the cyclic permutation matrix, given by ::P= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&0&\\\\ldots&0&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&0&\\\\ldots&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\ddots&\\\\ddots&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&\\\\ldots&0&1&0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. * The set of n\\\\times n circulant matrices forms an n-dimensional vector space with respect to their standard addition and scalar multiplication. This space can be interpreted as the space of functions on the cyclic group of order n, C_n, or equivalently as the group ring of C_n. * Circulant matrices form a commutative algebra, since for any two given circulant matrices A and B, the sum A + B is circulant, the product AB is circulant, and AB = BA. * The matrix U that is composed of the eigenvectors of a circulant matrix is related to the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse transform: :: U_n^* = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} F_n, \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad U_n = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} F_n^{-1}, \\\\quad\\\\text{where}\\\\quad F_n = (f_{jk}) \\\\quad\\\\text{with}\\\\quad f_{jk} = e^{-2jk\\\\pi i/n}, \\\\quad\\\\text{for}\\\\quad 0\\\\leq j,k :Consequently the matrix U_n diagonalizes C. In fact, we have :: C = U_n \\\\operatorname{diag}(F_n c) U_n^* = \\\\frac{1}{n}F_n^{-1} \\\\operatorname{diag}(F_n c) F_n, :where c is the first column of C. The eigenvalues of C are given by the product F_n c. This product can be readily calculated by a fast Fourier transform. *Let p(x) be the (monic) characteristic polynomial of an n\\\\times n circulant matrix C, and let p'(x) be the derivative of p(x). Then the polynomial \\\\frac{1}{n}p'(x) is the characteristic polynomial of the following (n-1)\\\\times(n-1) submatrix of C: : C_{n-1}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_0 & c_{n-1} & \\\\dots & c_{3} & c_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1} & c_0 & c_{n-1} & & c_{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & c_{1} & c_0 & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{n-3} & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & c_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{n-2} & c_{n-3} & \\\\dots & c_{1} & c_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} (see for proof). Analytic interpretation Circulant matrices can be interpreted geometrically, which explains the connection with the discrete Fourier transform. Consider vectors in \\\\mathbf{R}^n as functions on the integers with period n, (i.e., as periodic bi-infinite sequences: \\\\dots,a_0,a_1,\\\\dots,a_{n-1},a_0,a_1,\\\\dots) or equivalently, as functions on the cyclic group of order n (C_n or \\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z}) geometrically, on (the vertices of) the regular n-gon: this is a discrete analog to periodic functions on the real line or circle. Then, from the perspective of operator theory, a circulant matrix is the kernel of a discrete integral transform, namely the convolution operator for the function (c_0,c_1,\\\\dots,c_{n-1}); this is a discrete circular convolution. The formula for the convolution of the functions (b_i) := (c_i) * (a_i) is :b_k = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i c_{k-i} (recall that the sequences are periodic) which is the product of the vector (a_i) by the circulant matrix for (c_i). The discrete Fourier transform then converts convolution into multiplication, which in the matrix setting corresponds to diagonalization. The C^*-algebra of all circulant matrices with complex entries is isomorphic to the group C^*-algebra of \\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z}. Symmetric circulant matrices For a symmetric circulant matrix C one has the extra condition that c_{n-i}=c_i. Thus it is determined by \\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor + 1 elements. : C= \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_0 & c_1 & \\\\dots & c_{2} & c_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1} & c_0 & c_1 & & c_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & c_{1}& c_0 & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_2 & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & c_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_1 & c_2 & \\\\dots & c_{1} & c_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. The eigenvalues of any real symmetric matrix are real. The corresponding eigenvalues become: : \\\\lambda_j = c_0 + 2 c_1 \\\\Re \\\\omega_j + 2 c_2 \\\\Re \\\\omega_j^2 + \\\\ldots + 2c_{n/2-1} \\\\Re \\\\omega_j^{n/2-1} + c_{n/2} \\\\omega_j^{n/2} for n even, and : \\\\lambda_j = c_0 + 2 c_1 \\\\Re \\\\omega_j + 2 c_2 \\\\Re \\\\omega_j^2 + \\\\ldots + 2c_{(n-1)/2} \\\\Re \\\\omega_j^{(n-1)/2} for odd n, where \\\\Re z denotes the real part of z. This can be further simplified by using the fact that \\\\Re \\\\omega_j^k= \\\\cos(2\\\\pi j k/n). Complex symmetric circulant matrices The complex version of the circulant matrix, ubiquitous in communications theory, is usually Hermitian. In this case c_{n-i}=c_i^*, \\\\; i \\\\le n/2 and its determinant and all eigenvalues are real. If n is even the first two rows necessarily takes the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} r_0 & z_1 & z_2 & r_3 & z_2^* & z_1^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_1^* & r_0 & z_1 & z_2 & r_3 & z_2^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. in which the first element r_3 in the top second half-row is real. If n is odd we get : \\\\begin{bmatrix} r_0 & z_1 & z_2 & z_2^* & z_1^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_1^* & r_0 & z_1 & z_2 & z_2^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Tee has discussed constraints on the eigenvalues for the complex symmetric condition.  Applications  =In linear equations= Given a matrix equation :\\\\mathbf{C} \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b}, where C is a circulant square matrix of size n we can write the equation as the circular convolution :\\\\mathbf{c} \\\\star \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b}, where c is the first column of C, and the vectors c, x and b are cyclically extended in each direction. Using the circular convolution theorem, we can use the discrete Fourier transform to transform the cyclic convolution into component-wise multiplication :\\\\mathcal{F}_{n}(\\\\mathbf{c} \\\\star \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathcal{F}_{n}(\\\\mathbf{c}) \\\\mathcal{F}_{n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathcal{F}_{n}(\\\\mathbf{b}) so that :\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathcal{F}_{n}^{-1} \\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{(\\\\mathcal{F}_n(\\\\mathbf{b}))_{ u}} {(\\\\mathcal{F}_n(\\\\mathbf{c}))_{ u}} \\\\right )_{\\\\\\\\! u \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\right ]^{\\\\rm T}. This algorithm is much faster than the standard Gaussian elimination, especially if a fast Fourier transform is used. = In graph theory = In graph theory, a graph or digraph whose adjacency matrix is circulant is called a circulant graph (or digraph). Equivalently, a graph is circulant if its automorphism group contains a full-length cycle. The Möbius ladders are examples of circulant graphs, as are the Paley graphs for fields of prime order.

In chemistry, a trivial name is a nonsystematic name for a chemical substance. That is, the name is not recognized according to the rules of any formal system of chemical nomenclature such as IUPAC inorganic or IUPAC organic nomenclature. A trivial name is not a formal name and is usually a common name. Generally, trivial names are not useful in describing the essential properties of the thing being named. Properties such as the molecular structure of a chemical compound are not indicated. And, in some cases, trivial names can be ambiguous or will carry different meanings in different industries or in different geographic regions. (For example, a trivial name such as white metal can mean various things.) On the other hand, systematic names can be so convoluted and difficult to parse that their trivial names are preferred. As a result, a limited number of trivial chemical names are retained names, an accepted part of the nomenclature. Trivial names often arise in the common language; they may come from historic usages in, for example, alchemy. Many trivial names pre-date the institution of formal naming conventions. Names can be based on a property of the chemical, including appearance (color, taste or smell), consistency, and crystal structure; a place where it was found or where the discoverer comes from; the name of a scientist; a mythological figure; an astronomical body; the shape of the molecule; and even fictional figures. All elements that have been isolated have trivial names. Definitions In scientific documents, international treaties, patents and legal definitions, names for chemicals are needed that identify them unambiguously. This need is satisfied by systematic names. One such system, established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), was established in 1950. Other systems have been developed by the American Chemical Society, the International Organization for Standardization, and the World Health Organization. However, chemists still use many names that are not systematic because they are traditional or because they are more convenient than the systematic names. These are called trivial names. The word \\"trivial\\", often used in a pejorative sense, was intended to mean \\"commonplace\\". In addition to trivial names, chemists have constructed semi-trivial names by appending a standard symbol to a trivial stem. Some trivial and semi-trivial names are so widely used that they have been officially adopted by IUPAC; these are known as retained names. Elements Traditional names of elements are trivial, some originating in alchemy. IUPAC has accepted these names, but has also defined systematic names of elements that have not yet been prepared. It has adopted a procedure by which the scientists who are credited with preparing an element can propose a new name. Once the IUPAC has accepted such a (trivial) name, it replaces the systematic name. =Origins= A plaque commemorating a mine in Ytterby where ore was obtained from which four new elements were isolated. Pierre and Marie Curie. Nine elements were known by the Middle Ages - gold, silver, tin, mercury, copper, lead, iron, sulfur, and carbon. Mercury was named after the planet, but its symbol was derived from the Latin hydrargyrum, which itself comes from the greek υδράργυρος, meaning liquid silver; mercury is also known as quicksilver in English. The symbols for the other eight are derived from their Latin names. Systematic nomenclature began after Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau stated the need for “a constant method of denomination, which helps the intelligence and relieves the memory”. The resulting system was popularized by Antoine Lavoisier's publication of Méthode de nomenclature chimique (Method of Chemical Nomenclature) in 1787. Lavoisier proposed that elements be named after their properties. For the next 125 years, most chemists followed this suggestion, using Greek and Latin roots to compose the names; for example, hydrogen (\\"water-producing\\"), oxygen (\\"acid-producing\\"), nitrogen (\\"soda-producing\\"), bromine (\\"stink\\"), and argon (\\"no reaction\\") were based on Greek roots, while the names of iodine and chlorine were derived from the Greek words for their characteristic colors. Indium, rubidium, and thallium were similarly named for the colors of particular lines in their emission spectra. Iridium, which forms compounds of many different colors, takes its name from iris, the Latin for \\"rainbow\\". The noble gases have all been named for their origin or properties. Helium comes from the Greek helios, meaning \\"sun\\" because it was first detected as a line in the spectrum of the sun (it is not known why the suffix -ium, which is used for metals, was chosen). The other noble gases are neon (\\"new\\"), argon (\\"slow, lazy\\"), krypton (\\"hidden\\"), xenon (\\"stranger\\"), and radon (\\"from radium\\"). Many more elements have been given names that have little or nothing to do with their properties. Elements have been named for celestial bodies (helium, selenium, tellurium, for the sun, moon, and earth; cerium and palladium for Ceres and Pallas, two asteroids). They have been named for mythological figures, including Titans in general (titanium) and Prometheus in particular (promethium); Roman and Greek gods (uranium, neptunium, and plutonium) and their descendants (tantalum for Tantalus, a son of Zeus, and niobium for Niobe, a daughter of Tantalus); and Norse deities (vanadium for the goddess Vanadis and thorium for the god Thor). Some elements were named for aspects of the history of their discovery. In particular, technetium and promethium were so named because the first samples detected were artificially synthesised; neither of the two has any isotope sufficiently stable to occur in nature on Earth in significant quantities. The connection to the Titan Prometheus was that he had been fabled to have stolen fire from the gods for mankind. Discoverers of some elements named them after their home country or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium were based on the Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements, terbium, erbium, ytterbium, and yttrium were named after a Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, thulium (after an old Roman name for the far north of Scandinavia), holmium, copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and darmstadtium. For the elements up to 92 (uranium), naming elements after people was discouraged. The two exceptions are indirect, the elements being named after minerals that were themselves named after people. These were gadolinium (found in gadolinite, named after the Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin) and samarium (the mineral samarskite was named after a Russian mining engineer, Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets). Among the transuranium elements, this restriction was relaxed, there followed curium (after the Curies), einsteinium (Albert Einstein), fermium (Enrico Fermi), mendelevium (Dmitri Mendeleev), nobelium (Alfred Nobel) and lawrencium (Ernest Lawrence). =Relation to IUPAC standards= IUPAC has established international standards for naming elements. The first scientist or laboratory to isolate an element has the right to propose a name; after a review process, a final decision is made by the IUPAC Council. In keeping with tradition, names can be based on a mythological concept or character, astronomical object, mineral, place, property of the element or scientist. For those elements that have not yet been discovered, IUPAC has established a systematic name system. The names combine syllables that represent the digits of the atomic number, followed by \\"-ium\\". For example, \\"unununium\\" is element 111 (\\"un\\" being the syllable for 1). However, once the element has been found, the systematic name is replaced by a trivial one, in this case roentgenium. The IUPAC names for elements are intended for use in the official languages. At the time of the first edition of the IUPAC Red Book (which contains the rules for inorganic compounds), those languages were English and French; now English is the sole official language. However, other languages still have their own names for elements. The chemical symbol for tungsten, W, is based on the German name , which is found in wolframite and comes from the German for \\"wolf's foam\\", how the mineral was known to Saxon miners. The name tungsten means \\"heavy stone\\", a description of scheelite, another mineral in which tungsten is found. The German names for hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are (water substance), (acid substance), and (smothering substance). Russian names for hydrogen, oxygen and carbon are vodorod, kislorod and uglerod (generating water, acid and coal respectively). The corresponding Chinese names are qīngqì (light gas), yǎngqì (nourishing gas), and dànqì (diluting gas). A method for translating chemical names into Chinese was developed by John Fryer and Xu Shou in 1871. Where traditional names were well established, they kept them; otherwise, a single character was created. Inorganic chemistry Red hematite-rich sample from a banded iron formation in Wyoming. Early terminology for compound chemicals followed similar rules to the naming of elements. The names could be based on the appearance of the substance, including all five senses. In addition, chemicals were named after the consistency, crystalline form, a person or place, its putative medical properties or method of preparation. Salt (sodium chloride) is soluble and is used to enhance the taste of food. Substances with similar properties came to be known as salts, in particular Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate, found in a bitter saline spring in the English town of Epsom). Ammonium (with the little-used formal name nitrogen trihydride) was first extracted from sal ammoniac, meaning \\"salt of Amun\\". Ancient Romans noticed crystals of it in Egyptian temples devoted to the god Amun; the crystals had condensed from the smoke of burning camel dung. Lead acetate was called sugar of lead. However, other names like sugar of lead (lead(II) acetate), butter of antimony (antimony trichloride), oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid), and cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) borrowed their language from the kitchen. Many more names were based on color; for example, hematite, orpiment, and verdigris come from words meaning \\"blood-like stone\\", \\"gold pigment\\", and \\"green of Greece\\". Some names are based on their use. Lime is a general name for materials combining calcium with carbonates, oxides or hydroxides; the name comes from a root \\"sticking or adhering\\"; its earliest use was as mortar for construction. Water has several systematic names, including oxidane (the IUPAC name), hydrogen oxide, and dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO). The latter was the basis of the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, a document that was circulated warning readers of the dangers of the chemical (for example, it is fatal if inhaled).. . Organic chemistry In organic chemistry, some trivial names derive from a notable property of the thing being named. For instance, lecithin, the common name for phosphatidylcholine, was originally isolated from egg yolk. The word is coined from the Greek λέκιθος (lékithos) for yolk. Many trivial names continue to be used because their sanctioned equivalents are considered too cumbersome for everyday use. For example, \\"tartaric acid\\", a compound found in wine, has a systematic name of 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. The pigment β-Carotene has an IUPAC name of 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-[(1E,3E,5E,7E,9E,11E,13E,15E,17E)-3,7,12,16-tetramethyl-18-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexen-1-yl)octadeca-1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17-nonaenyl]cyclohexene. However, the trivial name can be potentially confusing. Based on its name, one might come to the conclusion that the molecule theobromine contains one or more bromine atoms. In reality it is an alkaloid similar in structure to caffeine. =Shape-based= Several organic molecules have semitrivial names where the suffixes -ane (for an alkane) or -ene (for an alkene) are added to a name based on the shape of the molecule. Some are pictured below. Other examples include barrelene (shaped like a barrel), fenestrane (having a window-pane motif), ladderane (a ladder shape), olympiadane (having a shape with the same topology as the Olympic rings) and quadratic acid (also known as squaric acid).

The bohemic acid complex is a mixture of chemicals obtained through fermentation of a species of actinobacteria. In 1977 the components were isolated and have been found useful as antitumor agents and anthracycline antibiotics. The authors named the complex (and one of its components, bohemamine) after the opera La bohème by Puccini, and the remaining components were named after characters in the opera: alcindoromycin (Alcindoro), collinemycin (Colline), marcellomycin (Marcello), mimimycin (Mimi), musettamycin (Musetta), rudolphomycin (Rodolfo) and schaunardimycin (Schaunard). However, the relationships between the characters do not correctly reflect the chemical relationships. A research lab at Lepetit Pharmaceuticals, led by Piero Sensi, was fond of coining nicknames for chemicals that they discovered, later converting them to a form more acceptable for publication. The antibiotic rifampicin was named after a French movie, Rififi, about a jewel heist. They nicknamed another antibiotic \\"Mata Hari\\" before changing the name to matamycin.

His second, it was published in 1984, and remains his most controversial work. Its use of pornography as a narrative device attracted much criticism, although others, including Gray himself, consider it his best work.  Plot summary  The novel is narrated by Jock McLeish, a supervisor of the installation of alarm systems. Divorced, alcoholic and approaching fifty, his problems coalesce in a long night of the soul in a hotel room in Peebles or Selkirk. McLeish attempts to spend the night assembling an intricate pornographic fantasy. His cast of characters includes: Janine, based on a childhood memory of Jane Russell in The Outlaw; Superb (short for Superbitch); and Big Momma, an obese lesbian. All of these are submitted to sadomasochistic practices, parts of which are described at some length. However, McLeish constantly returns to reminiscences of his previous life and lovers. These prompt his attempted suicide. Chapter 11 of the novel is a typographical explosion, with the text splitting into several parallel voices on each page (including that of God). The crisis concludes with McLeish vomiting up the pills which he had hoped would kill him, and facing the truth of his actions as morning dawns.  Literary significance & criticism  On the first hardback and paperback editions, Gray wrote that \\"This already dated novel is set inside the head of an ageing, divorced, alcoholic, insomniac supervisor of security installations who is tippling in the bedroom of a small Scottish hotel. Though full of depressing memories and propaganda for the Conservative Party it is mainly a sadomasochistic fetishistic fantasy. Even the arrival of God in the later chapters fails to elevate the tone. Every stylistic excess and moral defect which critics conspired to ignore in the author's first books, Lanark and Unlikely Stories, Mostly, is to be found here in concentrated form.\\" In a 2000 interview, Gray said \\"When writing the pornographic parts of 1982, Janine I was deliberately shocking myself. Though I think it my best novel I cannot now reread it - I'm back to being as old fashioned as I was before imagining it.\\" An example of the typography in chapter 11 1982, Janine polarised critics like few other novels in modern literary history. The paperback edition of the novel concludes with an appendix of criticism of the work, both for and against. Critics praising the work included Jonathan Baumbach in The New York Times (\\"1982 Janine has a verbal energy, an intensity of vision\\") and William Boyd in the Times Literary Supplement (\\"His style is limpid and classically elegant\\"). The Boyd quotation is juxtaposed with one from Paul Ableman in The Literary Review criticising the \\"irritating mannerisms\\". Peter Levi on the BBC called the book \\"Radioactive hogwash\\", while Joe Ambrose of the Irish Sunday Tribune (who has expressed virulently critical views on many of Gray's books) called the author \\"a vainglorious lout\\" and \\"a profoundly reactionary penman\\". J.A. McArdle, in the Irish Independent wrote: \\"I have read reviews of these books which makes me suspect that the commentators had never read them. 1982, Janine is not pornography but a thoughtful and sad study of the human predicament; to be trapped in a world where the little man, woman or country will always be exploited by the big bullies.\\"1982, Janine - Lanark 1982: an unofficial Alasdair Gray website In an introduction to the 2003 Canongate Classic edition, Will Self argues that the controversial pornographic fantasies illustrate McLeish's repression of his past real love affairs, reflect his reactionary political stance, and show the effects of his childhood experiences. McLeish's linking of sex with the idea of \\"homecoming\\" originates in his difficult relationship with his mother. Self also notes the significance of the title, 1982 being \\"a point at which Scotland could be said to have reached just one of its many nadirs\\". This lowpoint included the destruction of the coal industry which had employed McLeish's father, under a Conservative government of which McLeish is a supporter. Dave Langford reviewed Mantissa for White Dwarf #55, and stated that \\"God and several SF themes make guest appearances, and there's a chapter of the most boggling typography since early Alfred Bester.

A hem in sewing is a garment finishing method, where the edge of a piece of cloth is folded and sewn to prevent unravelling of the fabric and to adjust the length of the piece in garments, such as at the end of the sleeve or the bottom of the garment. Methods A presser foot on a home sewing machine includes measurement markings on the plate beneath the foot for easier hemming. Shown are measurements in fractions of an inch (above) and in millimetres (below). There are many different styles of hems of varying complexities. The most common hem folds up a cut edge, folds it up again, and then sew it down. The style of hemming thus completely encloses the cut edge in cloth, so that it cannot unravel. Other hem styles use fewer folds. One of the simplest hems encloses the edge of cloth with a stitch without any folds at all, using a method called an overcast stitch, although an overcast stitch may be used to finish a folded \\"plain hem\\" as well. There are even hems that do not call for sewing, instead using iron-on materials, netting, plastic clips, or other fasteners. These threadless hems are not common, and are often used only on a temporary basis. The hem may be sewn down with a line of invisible stitches or blind stitch, or sewn down by a sewing machine. The term hem is also extended to other cloth treatments that prevent unraveling. Hems can be serged (see serger), hand rolled and then sewn down with tiny stitches (still seen as a high-class finish to handkerchiefs), pinked with pinking shears, piped, covered with binding (this is known as a Hong Kong finish), or made with many other inventive treatments. Most haute couture hems are sewn by hand. Decorative embroidery embellishment is sometimes referred to as a hem-stitch design. Types of hems and hem stitches Hems of different depths (which includes the seam allowance) may have a particular style to achieve, which requires more or less fabric depending upon the style. A handkerchief-style edge requires a hem allowance of 0.6 cm or a quarter inch. A typical skirt or pant hem may be 5-7.6 cm. The hem's depth affects the way the fabric of the finished fabric will drape. Heavier fabric requires a relatively shorter hem. An interface fabric sewn to the fabric in the hem has a useful function in some hem styles. A bias strip is sometimes used as a hem interface. This adds fullness to the finished garment and reduce wrinkling. The hem stitches that are commonly used for hand-sewn hems include: pick stitch; catch stitch (also called a herringbone stitch); slip stitch; and blind stitch. Sewing machines can make a stitch that appears nearly invisible by using a blind-stitch setting and a blind stitch foot. Blind-stitches are commonly used to finish hems of applique designs on fabric. Modern sewing machines designed for home use can make many decorative or functional stitches, so the number of possible hem treatments is large. These home-use machines can also sew a reasonable facsimile of a hem-stitch, though the stitches will usually be larger and more visible. Clothing factories and professional tailors use a \\"blind hemmer\\", or hemming machine, which sews an invisible stitch quickly and accurately. A blind hemmer sews a chain stitch, using a bent needle, which can be set precisely enough to actually sew through one and a half thicknesses of the hemmed fabric. A rolled hem presser foot on a sewing machine enables quick and easy hemming even by home sewers. Heavy material with deep hems may be hemmed with what is called a dressmaker's hem​—​an extra line of loose running stitch is added in the middle of the hem, so that all the weight of the cloth does not hang from one line of stitching. File:5 thread overlock hem.jpgA five-thread overlock hem made with a serger machine. This photo shows the inside of the garment. On the outside of the garment, this would appear as a blind stitch.

It was originally conceived as a method to construct molds for industrial parts. Khoshnevis decided to adapt the technology for rapid home construction as a way to rebuild after natural disasters, like the devastating earthquakes that have plagued his native Iran. Using a quick-setting, concrete-like material, contour crafting forms the house's walls layer by layer until topped off by floors and ceilings set in place by the crane. The notional concept calls for the insertion of structural components, plumbing, wiring, utilities, and even consumer devices like audiovisual systems as the layers are built. History Caterpillar Inc. provided funding to help support Viterbi project research in the summer of 2008. In 2009, Singularity University graduate students established the ACASA project with Khoshnevis as the CTO to commercialize Contour Crafting. In 2010, Khoshnevis claimed that his system could build a complete home in a single day, and its electrically powered crane would produce very little construction material waste. The Science Channel's Discoveries This Week program in 2005 reported that, given 3–7 tons of material waste and the exhaust fumes from construction vehicles during standard home construction, contour crafting could significantly reduce environmental impact. Khoshnevis stated in 2010 that NASA was evaluating Contour Crafting for its application in the construction of bases on Mars and the Moon. After three years, in 2013, NASA funded a small study at the University of Southern California to further develop the Contour Crafting 3D printing technique. Potential applications of this technology include constructing lunar structures of a material that could be built of 90-percent lunar material with only ten percent of the material transported from Earth. In 2017 the Contour Crafting Corporation (of which Khoshnevis is the CEO) announced a partnership with and investment from Doka Ventures.

He was an artillery captain in the Italian Army. Expeditions In his first expedition Bottego concentrated on tracing the channels of the tributaries of the Ganale Doria, that he named after the Italian biologist Giacomo Doria. With Captain Matteo Grixoni, Bottego left Bardera on 30 September 1892, with one hundred and twenty-four men. They reached the Shebeli River at Imi on 7 November. After eight days they crossed the river, entering the country of the Arsi Oromo, who proved hostile to Bottego. He passed through Arkebla and reached the Ganale Guracha (\\"Black Ganale\\") on 11 December, along whose banks he led his men upstream for 20 days. Concluding that this was not the main stream of the river, Bottego left the river in a west-south-western direction until he reached the Ganale Doria, or the main fork of the Ganale, on 16 January 1893. Sick with fever, here Bottego was left by Grixoni who marched for the coast on 15 February with 30 men. Four days after Grixoni left, Bottego pushed inland as far as Mount Fakes, but unwilling to encounter raiding parties of the Ethiopians, he returned to the camp where Grixoni had left him. Bottego then crossed the tract separating him from the Dawa, and ascended that river until lack of provisions compelled him to retrace his steps. His party reached the Ganale Doria once more after six forced marches, in the course of which eleven men died of hunger. Two more died in camp from exhaustion, and two were drowned while hunting hippopotamuses.Ravenstein EG (1894). \\"Italian Explorations in the Upper Basin of the Jub\\".

He was the first European explorer to follow the course of the lower Omo River to its confluence with Lake Turkana. He reached and first found Lake Abaya, which he renamed Lake Margherita after Queen Margherita of Savoy wife of King Humbert I of Italy. He then tried to return through Ethiopia, unaware that the country was at war with Italy, let alone that there had been a recent Ethiopian victory at Adwa. He was killed in the Maji range near Jellen when he was attacked by an Oromo tribe. His body was never recovered, and the account of his demise was told years later by two of his companions, Vannutelli and Citerni, who survived but were kept in prison for two years by Menelik II, emperor of Ethiopia. Species named after Bottego Bottego is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards: Agama bottegi and Chalcides bottegi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Gessi was born to an Italian father and Armenian mother from Istanbul in Ravenna, in Romagna.Moorehead, 185. He acquired his military experience serving in the volunteer corps of Garibaldi in 1859 and 1860. He was one of numerous Garibaldi volunteers who went on to be regular soldiers, not only in the new Italian army, but in several others. He also fought with the British forces in the Crimean War (1854–55), where he first met General Charles George Gordon. Gordon later described him as \\"Italian subject, aged 49 (in 1881). Short, compact figure; cool, most determined man. Born genius for practical ingenuity in mechanics. Ought to have been born in 1560, not 1832. Same disposition as Francis Drake. Had been engaged in many petty political affairs. Was interpreter to Her Majesty's Forces in the Crimea, and attached to the headquarters of the Royal Artillery.\\"Moorehead, 168. In 1876, while serving for General Gordon, he explored the course of the upper Nile (Bahr El Jebel) and mapped its descent from Lake Albert. He then ventured in the territory of the Oromo people, later becoming governor of the Egyptian Bahr-el-Ghazal province, where he struggled against Sebehr and the slave trade and also started the deployment of natural gum. Gordon regarded him, perhaps unfairly, as a brilliant mercenary - perhaps he did not come up to Gordon's standards of Noncomformist rectitude. In 1880, while returning to Khartoum, he found the Nile obstructed and was held up for three months, becoming ill. This illness led to his death, shortly after his return to Suez. After his death, his son Felice published his father's memoirs in the book, Sette anni nel Sudan egiziano (Milano, 1891).

Its mission is to advance the atmospheric and related sciences, technologies, applications, and services for the benefit of society.  Background  Founded in 1919 by Charles Franklin Brooks, the American Meteorological Society has a membership of more than 13,000 weather, water, and climate scientists, professionals, researchers, educators, students, and enthusiasts. AMS offers numerous programs and services in the sphere of water, weather and climate sciences. It publishes eleven atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic journals (in print and online), sponsors as many as twelve conferences annually, and administers professional certification programs and awards. The AMS Policy and Education programs promote scientific knowledge and work to increase public understanding of science. There is also an extensive network of local and student AMS chapters. AMS headquarters is located at 45 Beacon Street adjacent to the Boston Common in Boston, Massachusetts. The headquarters building was designed by Charles Bulfinch as the third Harrison Gray Otis House in 1806 and was purchased and renovated by AMS in 1958, with staff moving into the building in 1960. In 2012, AMS purchased the building next door at 44 Beacon Street, also designed by Bulfinch. AMS also maintains an office in Washington, D.C. at 1200 New York Avenue NW inside the AAAS headquarters.  Certification programs  AMS maintains professional certification programs: the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist (CBM) sets a professional standard in broadcast meteorology and the Certified Consulting Meteorologist (CCM) establishes high standards of technical competence, character, and experience for consultants who provide advice in meteorology to the public. The AMS Seal of Approval was launched in 1957 to recognize on-air meteorologists for their sound delivery of weather information to the general public. Many seal holders are still active, though the original Seal was succeeded by the CBM. Those looking for an expert can consult the listings of all AMS Certified individuals. 657x657px  Awards  AMS recognizes excellent work with over 30 different awards ranging from outstanding research contributions in specific fields to awards for excellence in teaching or broadcasting, outstanding books, exceptional service in forecasting, and more including its highest honor: the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Medal. AMS also awards more than $100,000 annually in undergraduate and graduate level scholarships and fellowships.  Publications  AMS publishes eleven peer reviewed scientific journals, as well as books, and monographs, accounting for more than 34,000 pages each year. AMS journals are consistently ranked at or near the top of their fields for impact factor. * Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS) * Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences (JAS) * Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology (JAMC) * Journal of Physical Oceanography (JPO) * Monthly Weather Review (MWR) * Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology (JTECH) * Weather and Forecasting (WAF) * Journal of Climate (JCLI) * Journal of Hydrometeorology (JHM) * Weather, Climate, and Society (WCAS) * Earth Interactions (EI) (co-published with AGU & AAG) * Meteorological Monographs In addition, AMS publishes the Glossary of Meteorology, a blog and the scientific database Meteorological and Geoastrophysical Abstracts. AMS is a member of Crossref, Portico, CHORUS, and CLOCKSS.  Policy Program  The AMS Policy Program works to increase public understanding of the role of scientific information in societal advancement and helps policy-makers ground their decisions in the best available scientific knowledge. It carries out research, holds periodic briefings that allow experts to inform policy makers directly on established scientific understanding and the latest policy-relevant research, and hosts an annual Summer Policy Colloquium to introduce Earth scientists to the federal policy process. The Congressional Science Fellowship places an AMS scientist on the staff of a member of Congress for one full year.  Statements  AMS issues and periodically updates four different types of statements on topics that fall within the scope of AMS expertise: * Information statements aim to provide a trustworthy, objective and scientifically up-to-date explanation of scientific issues of concern to the public at large. They deal with subjects such as climate change and drought. * Policy statements are aimed at officials of government or international bodies and may articulate the state of scientific understanding, raise awareness of a scientific issue, or make policy recommendations based on the professional and scientific expertise and perspectives of the AMS (examples: Weather, Water, and Climate Priorities; Geoengineering the Climate System; Space Weather) * Professional guidance statements alert AMS members to urgent or important AMS, professional or scientific matters. (examples: Strengthening Social Sciences in the Weather–Climate Enterprise; Green Meetings) * Best Practice statements inform AMS members and the public about AMS endorsed best practices across the weather, water, and climate enterprise and promote scientifically-based standards and practices. (example: Best Practices for Publicly Sharing Weather Information Via Social Media)  Meetings and events  AMS organizes a large number national and international meetings, specialized conferences and workshops. Annually, more than 6,000 people attend AMS meetings covering science, technology and applications in the atmospheric and related oceanographic and hydrologic sciences. In addition to the AMS Annual Meeting, the 98th of which was held in Austin, Texas in 2018, a number of specialty meetings are held each year. AMS records oral presentations given at its meetings and posts them online for anyone to view free of charge. Over thirty conferences and symposia are held concurrently during the AMS Annual Meeting, during which more than 2000 Oral Presentations are given, and more than 1000 Posters are presented. The AMS Annual Meeting also features an exhibits program, where companies and organizations participate.  Education Program  The AMS Education Program offers training, workshops, and undergraduate course curriculum to educate the next generation and increase scientific literacy. It claims to have trained over 100,000 teachers. AMS partners with NOAA, NASA the NSF and the U.S. Navy to offer a suite of teacher professional development programs, including three DataStreme courses, Project ATMOSPHERE, and the Maury Project. Textbooks and Investigations Manuals used in AMS DataStreme and Undergraduate Courses are dynamic eBooks with web-based features. Many AMS members contribute to the creation and editing of course materials.  Membership  The American Meteorological Society has more than 13,000 individual members in nearly 100 countries. Membership was initially limited to professionals or scholars in the atmospheric or related sciences, but today an array of membership categories accommodate a wide range of people including students, teachers, corporations and weather enthusiasts. =Fellows= Fellows of the AMS are those who \\"have made outstanding contributions to the atmospheric or related oceanic or hydrologic sciences or their applications during a substantial period of years\\".

After a short career as a pilot boat, owing to steam replacing sail, she became a fishing boat, a racing yacht and a sail training vessel. History Bought by Evelyn George Martin in 1923 she was refitted and won the first Fastnet race from seven starters in August 1925. In 1927 Martin sold Jolie Brise, through an advertisement in Yachting World to Captain Warren Ferrier and his partner Dr Brownlow Smith. An engine and an additional cabin were fitted at Morgan Giles's yard at Teignmouth. Bobby Somerset, a founder member of the Ocean Racing Club - as was Martin, purchased her in 1928. After competing in the Fastnet, Bermuda and Santander races he sold her four years later to Lt. John Gage, RNR. His ownership was only for a year and it seems that in 1934 she was purchased by an American, Stanley Mortimer. Alterations, mostly to the living accommodation were made at a yard in Palma, Majorca and a Gardner diesel was fitted in Marseilles. After cruising the Mediterranean, and with war in the offing Jolie Brise returned to Southampton and was put up for sale. She was bought by William Stannard but requisitioned by the Royal Navy which laid her up on a mud berth at Shoreham for the duration of the war. In 1945 she was bought by a syndicate headed by Lillian and Jim Worsdell and her name was changed to Pleasant Breeze. A voyage to New Zealand was aborted and when she put into Lisbon she was acquired by a Portuguese syndicate headed by Luis Lobato. Repaired and refitted, she was once again listed as Jolie Brise. For nearly 30 years her home port remained Lisbon but in 1975, partly because of the political situation in Portugal, she returned to the Solent, 50 years after her first Fastnet win. Current Role In 1977 she was bought by Dauntsey's School to serve as the flagship of its sailing club and remains in that role. The boat is currently skippered by Toby Marris, and has the capacity to carry up to 12 students for local and international cruising and racing trips. Specifications *Sparred length: *Length on deck: *Load waterline length: *Beam: *Draught: *Displacement: 23 tonnes Fastnet Races The Fastnet Race is a biennial offshore yacht race off the south coast of the United Kingdom, named after the Fastnet Rock, which the race course rounds. It is considered one of the classic offshore races. Jolie Brise won the inaugural Fastnet Race (then called the Ocean Race) in 1925 in a time of 6 days, 14 hours and 45 minutes as part of a fleet of seven boats. At the post-race dinner in Plymouth’s Royal Western Yacht Club, the new Ocean Racing Club (later the Royal Ocean Racing Club) was formed and its first commodore appointed, Jolie Brise’s owner Lt Cmdr Evelyn G Martin. Jolie Brise won the Fastnet again in 1929 and 1930, again skippered by Martin. She is currently the only vessel to have won the race three times. She also competed in the 2013 Fastnet Race, crewed by students from Dauntsey's School and the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, finishing 277th in fleet of 294 boats with a time of 4 days, 19 hours, 11 minutes and 4 seconds. Blue Water Medals The prestigious Blue Water Medal was inaugurated by the Cruising Club of America in 1923 to reward \\"meritorious seamanship and adventure upon the sea displayed by amateur sailors of all nationalities, that might otherwise go unrecognized\\". Jolie Brise's two Blue Water Medals were both awarded for her conduct in the Bermuda Race. The first, in 1926, was to Evelyn Martin for \\"Double trans-Atlantic crossing, including Bermuda Race. LeHavre pilot cutter 56 feet oa. April 3, 1926 from Falmouth, July 27 to Plymouth.\\" Her second was awarded in 1932 to Robert Somerset \\"Without Date\\" for \\"remarkable feat of seamanship and courage in rescuing all but one of 11-man crew of burning schooner Adriana in the 1932 Bermuda Race.\\" On the first night of the 1932 Bermuda Race, the schooner Adriana was sailing into brisk southwesterly winds when the heat from the coal stove in her cabin ignited some oilskins. The uncontrollable fire spread so rapidly that the decision was made to abandon ship. Three miles ahead of Adriana was Jolie Brise, owned and sailed by Henry Robert Somers Fitzroy de Vere Somerset, known afloat as “Bobby.” His crew included Herbert L. Stone and the famous American racing helmsman Sherman Hoyt. In a feat of seamanship, Somerset, at Jolie Brise’s long tiller, turned the engineless, heavy-displacement vessel around toward the burning Adriana, whose crew was struggling to launch a small boat and heave the spinnaker pole into the water to serve as an improvised float. As Adriana’s helmsman, Clarence Kozaly, held position, Somerset brought Jolie Brise alongside under sail. The yachts’ rails banged together, their upper rigging tangled, and Jolie Brise’s tarred deadeye lanyards were charred. Ten of Adriana’s crew of 11 jumped across to the cutter’s deck. Only the dutiful Kozaly was left at the helm of Adriana. The two yachts were several feet apart when he finally let go the wheel and made his leap, only to tumble into the gap. Sherman Hoyt desperately threw him a line, but Kozaly’s heavy clothing drew him under. After helping to save 10 lives, he lost his own and is the only fatality in Bermuda Race history. Bermuda Post Office Stamps A Bermudan stamp with a picture of Jolie Brise, a gaff rigged pilot cutter A part of her participation in the Tall Ships Atlantic Challenge 2009, Jolie Brise sailed from Tenerife to Bermuda. To commemorate the event, the Bermuda Post Office Philatelic Department issued a set of stamps depicting six of the ships involved, including the Jolie Brise. Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant Jolie Brise was one of a number of prestigious vessels to be moored along the route of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II on 3 June 2012. Due to her size, she was not part of the flotilla of vessels, and was instead moored with other vessels at St Katharine Docks. Jolie Brise Pub Photo of the front of the Jolie Brise pub in Teignmouth In May 2018, Wetherspoons opened a pub in Teignmouth, Devon and named it The Jolie Brise after the boat which had been refitted in the town before her first Fastnet win in 1923. Jolie Brise visited the town for the opening of the pub. Chronology 1913: Built in Le Havre by Albert Paumelle 1923: New owner, E.G.

The name “AN/FSQ” derives from Army-Navy / Fixed Special eQuipment. An advancement of the pioneering MIT Whirlwind II digital computer design, and manufactured by IBM as prime contractor, the AN/FSQ-7 was the largest discrete computer system ever built, each of the 24 installed machines weighed 250 tons. The AN/FSQ-7 used a total of 60,000 vacuum tubes (49,000 in the computers) and up to 3 megawatts of electricity, performing about 75,000 instructions per second for networking regional radars. Primary functions Installations in the USAF Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense network were configured as duplex systems, using a pair of AN/FSQ-7 computers to provide fault tolerance. One was active at any time, the other on standby. The standby system copied data from the active system to minimize switchover time if needed. A scheduled switchover took place every day. The AN/FSQ-7 calculated one or more predicted interception points for assigning manned aircraft or CIM-10 Bomarc missiles to intercept an intruder using the Automatic Target and Battery Evaluation (ATABE) algorithm. Also used in the Nike AN/FSG-1 system, ATABE automated the Whiz Wheel (Felsenthal CPU-73 A/P Air Navigation Attack Computer) method used in manual command post operations. The Q7 fire button launched the Bomarc, and an additional Q7 algorithm automatically directed the missile during climb and cruise to the beginning of its supersonic dive on the target when guidance transferred to the missile seeker system for the homing dive. Later improvements allowed transmission of Q7 guidance to autopilots of manned fighters for vectoring to targetscompiled by via the SAGE Ground to Air Data Link Subsystem (cf. bomber vectoring to a Bomb Release Point in 1965–1973 Vietnam via vacuum-tube analog computers.) History The first United States radar network used voice reporting to the 1939 Twin Lights Station in New Jersey, and the post-World War II experimental Cape Cod System used a Whirlwind I computer at Cambridge, Massachusetts to network long-range and several short-range radars. The key Whirlwind modification for radar netting was the development of magnetic-core memory that vastly improved reliability, doubled operating speed, and quadrupled input speed relative to the original Williams tube memory of the Whirlwind I. The AN/FSQ-7 was based on the larger and faster (but uncompleted) Whirlwind II design. It proved too much for MIT's resources, resulting in IBM being retained as prime contractor - though the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Division 6 still participated in AN/FSQ-7 development. Similar to the Q7, the smaller AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Central was produced without an Automatic Initiation Area Discriminator and other equipment. Uses =SAGE= The experimental SAGE subsector, located in Lexington, Massachusetts, was completed in 1955, equipped with a prototype AN/FSQ-7 known as XD-1 in Building F. The third evaluation run with the XD-1 was in August and the prototype was complete in October 1955, except for displays. DC-1 at McGuire Air Force Base was the first operational site of the AN/FSQ-7 with consoles scheduled for delivery Aug–Oct 1956. Groundbreaking at McChord Air Force Base was in 1957 where the \\"electronic brain\\" began arriving in November 1958. The Cape Canaveral BOMARC 624-XY1's intercept of a target drone in August 1958 used the Kingston, New York, Q7 1500 miles away. By 1959, the 2000th simulated BOMARC intercept had been completed by the Q7. The SAGE/Missile Master test program conducted large-scale field testing of the ATABE mathematical model using radar tracks of actual Strategic Air Command and Air Defense Command aircraft conducting mock penetrations into defense sectors (cites Miller 1961) (cf. Operation Skyshield). The vacuum-tube SAGE network was completed (and obsolete) in 1963, and a system ergonomic test was performed at Luke Air Force Base in 1964. According to Harold Sackman, it \\"showed conclusively that the wrong timing of human and technical operations was leading to frequent truncation of the flight path tracking system.\\" Back-Up Interceptor Control Systems (BUIC) were used to replace the AN/FSQ-7s: two remained at SAGE sites until 1983 including McChord AFB, and the Q7 at Luke AFB was demolished in February 1984. =Sabre= The SABRE airline reservation system used AN/FSQ-7 technology. =In Popular Media= Q7 components were used as props in numerous films and television series needing futuristic-looking computers, despite the fact they were built in the 1950s. Q7 components were used in The Time Tunnel, The Towering Inferno, Logan's Run, WarGames, Independence Day, Planet of the Apes TV series (Season 1, Episode 5, \\"The Legacy\\" aired October 1974), and many others. =Today= The Computer History Museum displays several AN/FSQ-7 components.  Equipment  Situation Display console and other parts at Computer History Museum The AN/FSQ-7 had 100 system consoles, including the OA-1008 Situation Display (SD) with a light gun (at end of cable under plastic museum cover), cigarette lighter, and ash tray (left of the light gun). Maintenance Console MIT selected IBM as the prime contractor for equipment construction.Bash, Charles J. and others (1986) IBM's Early Computers, MIT, pp.240–248 The Central Computer System of the AN/FSQ-7 had two computers for redundancy each with Arithmetic, Core Memory, Instruction Control, Maintenance Control, Selection & IO Control, and Program elements. The Q7 had input/output devices such as: * IBM 723 card punch and IBM 713 punched card reader * IBM 718 line printer (64 print positions) * drum auxiliary memory (50 \\"fields\\" of 2048 words each) and IBM 728 magnetic tape drives (32-bit words) * Crosstelling Input (XTL) from other AN/FSQ sites * Display and Warning Light System with dozens of consoles in various rooms having Situation Display Tubes, Digital Display Tubes, and controls (e.g., push buttons and light gun) including: ** Duplex Maintenance Console (two), each DMC operated one of the Central Computer Systems and allowed diagnostics (a speaker was available) ** Tracker Initiator Consoles for designating a \\"blip\\" (radar return) to be tracked (assign a track number and to relay speed, direction, and altitude) ** Command Post Digital Display Desk ** Senior Director's keyed console with the Bomarc fire button ** LRI Monitor Console for monitoring Long Range Radar data ** Large Board Projection Equipment Operator displays were directly copied on 35 mm film which were projected on the board. Punched card data was transferred to and from the core memory as binary images. Only the rightmost 64 columns were transferred, with each row containing two 32-bit words. (The left columns could be punched using a special instruction.) Data were transferred to the line printer as a card image as well. =Core memory element= The FSQ-7 and -8 used core memory with 32-bit words plus a parity bit, operating at a 6-microsecond cycle time. Both machines had two banks of memory, memory 1 and memory 2 (Commonly referred to as Big Mem and little Mem). On the FSQ 7 memory 1 had 65,536 words and memory 2 had 4096 words. At Luke Air Force Base, the FSQ-7 held 65,536 words at each bank and the FSQ-8 4096 words at each bank. For data storage, each word was divided into two halves, each half was a 15-bit number with a sign bit. Arithmetic operations were performed on both halves simultaneously. Each number was treated as a fraction between −1 and 1. This restriction is placed on data primarily so that the multiplication of two numbers will always result in a product smaller than either of the numbers, thus positively avoiding overflow. Properly scaling calculations was the responsibility of the programmer. Instructions used the right half word plus the left sign bit to form addresses, yielding a 17-bit address space.

Grappa is traditionally produced in Northern Italy and is also widely consumed in places such as Argentina, Bulgaria, Uruguay and Galicia (better known as Spanish orujo or aguardiente). The flavor of grappa, like that of wine, depends on the type and quality of the grapes used, as well as the specifics of the distillation process. Grappa is made by distilling the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems (i.e., the pomace) left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes. It was originally made to prevent waste by using these leftovers. A similar drink, known as acquavite d'uva, is made by distilling whole must. Grappa is now a protected name in the European Union. To be called grappa, the following criteria must be met:Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks Regulation (EC) No 110/2008., Annex II paragraph 6 (grape marc spirit) and Annex III (geographical indications) # Produced in Italy, or in the Italian part of Switzerland, or in San Marino # Produced from pomace # Fermentation and distillation must occur on the pomace—no added water Criterion 2 rules out the direct fermentation of pure grape juice, which is the method used to produce brandy. Criterion 3 has two important implications. First, the distillation must occur on solids. Thus, it is carried out not with a direct flame but with a bain-marie or steam distillation; otherwise, the pomace may burn. Second, the woody parts of the grapes (the stems and seeds) are co-fermented with the sugar-rich juice; this produces a very small amount of methanol, which is much more toxic than ethanol. Unlike in the similar process of making red wine, in grappa the methanol must be carefully removed during distillation. That is why there is an Italian law requiring winemakers to sell their pomace to grappa makers; this is a measure that was taken against moonshine operations, which are now very rare in Italy. Use of the word grappa for product distilled in the United States is still allowed and falls under the Class definition of brandy further classified type as pomace, specifically grappa or grappa brandy. In Italy, grappa is primarily served as a digestive or after-dinner drink. Its main purpose is to aid in the digestion of heavy meals. Grappa may also be added to espresso coffee to create a caffè corretto, meaning \\"corrected\\" coffee. Another variation of this is the ammazzacaffè (\\"coffee- killer\\"): the espresso is drunk first, followed by a few ounces of grappa served in its own glass. In Veneto, there is resentin (\\"little rinser\\"): after finishing a cup of espresso with sugar, a few drops of grappa are poured into the nearly empty cup, swirled, and drunk down in one sip. Among the notable producers of grappa are Jacopo Poli, Nardini, and Nonino. These grappas are produced in significant quantities and are exported; there are also many small local or regional grappas. Most grappa is clear, indicating it is an unaged distillate, though some may retain very faint pigments from their original fruit pomace. Lately, aged grappas have become more common, and these take on a yellow or red-brown hue from the barrels in which they are stored. Grappa is also well known in Uruguay and Argentina, due to the significant Italian immigration in those countries. It is served as in Italy, after the main meals. In Uruguay, a local version called grappamiel has also been created, which sees honey added to the traditional grappa. It is widely served and mostly drunk in winter because it \\"warms\\" the throat. History Retort for continuous steam distillation dated from around 1960 Distillation is an ancient practice that can be traced back to the first century AD. While the distillation of alcohol may have been carried out reliably by the School of Salerno in the 12th century, fractional distillation was developed by Taddeo Alderotti in the 13th century. There is a legend that tells of a Roman soldier who first distilled grappa in the northern Italian town of Bassano del Grappa using distilling equipment stolen in Egypt (\\"Crisiopea di Cleopatra\\" 2nd century AD). However, the story cannot be considered reliable as such equipment could not produce grappa. Distillation useful for producing beverages was not discovered until the eighth century, and it likely took about two more centuries for the technology to travel from its home in the Levant and Persia to Italy (likely by route of the Crusades). Around 1300–1400 AD, however, the introduction of water as a coolant in the distilling equipment made it possible to produce a substantially larger amount of distilled wine and to distill pomace. Around 1600 AD, the Jesuits in Spain, Italy and Germany studied and codified the techniques used to produce brandy or grappa, and their methods were used until recent times.Istituto Nazionale Grappa The Museum of Wine and Grappa shows historical equipment used in the early years of grappa distillation. The modernisation of grappa distillation is relatively recent, probably in 1979 in Northern Italy. Initially it was carried out by direct flame but soon the advantages of a bain-marie or steam distillation to obtain a better product became obvious. Modern refinements included the distillation of pomace under vacuum, the use of varietal grapes and ageing in casks of various types of wood to improve the flavor of the liquor. Oak is the most used, but some more expensive grappas are aged successively in casks of acacia, ash and cherry-wood, an innovation introduced by the Marzadro Distillery. In Sardinia, Grappa is colloquially known as Filu è Ferru (iron wire), as most of the distillation was illegally home-made to avoid customs and excise taxes. The illegally distilled liquor was bottled, sealed and then buried in orchards, fields and pastures, awaiting sale. A bit of iron wire was tied around the bottleneck, barely protruding through the soil; after some time the wire would rust and disappear completely save for a faintly brown-red stain to the topsoil on the spot where the bottle was buried. While the peasant distiller could easily recognize the colored spot, the urban-schooled Guardia di Finanza officers were generally unable to tell the difference. Tasting A selection of grappas Professional tasters distinguish among four categories of grappa: young, cask-conditioned, aromatic, and aromatized. Grappa tastings begin with young grappas, then continue with cask-conditioned and aromatic grappas, and finish with aromatized grappas. When the tasting involves more than one grappa from the same category, the examination begins with the grappa that has the lowest alcohol content and concludes with the product richest in alcohol. When two grappas have the same alcohol content, the tasting begins with the smoother and less markedly flavored product, which the organizer of the tasting will have selected beforehand. Another way to \\"taste\\" grappa is by rubbing a small amount on the back of the hand and sniffing. If the aroma is pleasant, the grappa is well made. Impurities in grappa come out in the vapor and can be easily distinguished in this way. After each tasting, and before sampling another glass, some tasters recommend drinking half a glass of milk to refresh the taste receptors on the tongue. Various other food products can help stop taste-characteristics of one grappa from \\"dragging\\" or carrying over to the next. Foods that are effective in this role as well as providing an agreeable accompaniment to grappa's own flavor include: * Salted pistachio nuts With the introduction of \\"boutique\\" grappas, elaborate flute glasses have been promoted; traditionalists continue to taste grappa in shot glasses.

Not all the Bell's inequalities that appear in the literature are in fact fit for this purpose. The one discussed here holds only for a very limited class of local hidden variable theories and has never been used in practical experiments. It is, however, discussed by John Bell in his \\"Bertlmann's socks\\" paper (Bell, 1981), where it is referred to as the \\"Wigner–d'Espagnat inequality\\" (d'Espagnat, 1979; Wigner, 1970). It is also variously attributed to Bohm (1951?) and Belinfante (1973). Note that the inequality is not really applicable either to electrons or photons, since it builds in no probabilistic properties in the measurement process. Much more realistic hidden variable theories can be devised, modelling spin (or polarisation, in optical Bell tests) as a vector and allowing for the fact that not all emitted particles will be detected.  Derivation of the inequality  The approach of Sakurai (1994) is followed. Pick three arbitrary directions a, b, and c in which Alice and Bob can measure the spins of each electron they receive. We assume three hidden variables on each electron, for the three direction spins. We furthermore assume that these hidden variables are assigned to each electron pair in a consistent way at the time they are emitted from the source, and don't change afterwards. We do not assume anything about the probabilities of the various hidden variable values. Alice and Bob are two spatially separated observers. Between them is an apparatus that continuously produces pairs of electrons. One electron in each pair is sent toward Alice, and the other toward Bob. The setup is shown in the diagram. EPR thought experiment (This is just a thought-experiment, remember. Real experiments on pairs of electrons are not feasible and most \\"Bell test experiments\\" have instead been based on either the polarisation direction or the frequency and phase of light as individual particles called photons.) The electron pairs are specially prepared so that if both observers measure the spin of their electron along the same axis, then they will always get opposite results. For example, suppose Alice and Bob both measure the z-component of the spins that they receive. According to quantum mechanics, each of Alice's measurements will give either the value +1/2 or −1/2, with equal probability. For each result of +1/2 obtained by Alice, Bob's result will inevitably be −1/2, and vice versa. Mathematically, the state of each two-electron composite system can be described by the state vector :(1) \\\\left \\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\end{matrix} \\\\left( \\\\leftz+\\\\right\\\\rangle_A \\\\leftz-\\\\right\\\\rangle_B - \\\\leftz-\\\\right\\\\rangle_A \\\\leftz+\\\\right\\\\rangle_B \\\\right). Each ket is labelled by the direction in which the electron spin points. The above state is known as a spin singlet. The z-component of the spin corresponds to the operator (1/2)σz, where σz is the third Pauli matrix. It is possible to explain this phenomenon without resorting to quantum mechanics. Suppose our electron-producing apparatus assigns a parameter, known as a hidden variable, to each electron. It labels one electron \\"spin +1/2\\", and the other \\"spin −1/2\\". The choice of which of the two electrons to send to Alice is decided by some classical random process. Thus, whenever Alice measures the z-component spin and finds that it is +1/2, Bob will measure −1/2, simply because that is the label assigned to his electron. This reproduces the effects of quantum mechanics, while preserving the locality principle. The appeal of the hidden variables explanation dims if we notice that Alice and Bob are not restricted to measuring the z-component of the spin. Instead, they can measure the component along any arbitrary direction, and the result of each measurement is always either +1/2 or −1/2. Therefore, each electron must have an infinite number of hidden variables, one for each measurement that could possibly be performed. This is ugly, but not in itself fatal. However, Bell showed that by choosing just three directions in which to perform measurements, Alice and Bob can differentiate hidden variables from quantum mechanics. { border=\\"1\\" width=\\"250\\" align=right ! width=\\"80\\" Alice ! width=\\"80\\" Bob ! width=\\"80\\" Probability - ! a b c ! a b c ! - ! + + + ! − − − !

P8 } Each row in the table describes one type of electron pair, with their respective hidden variable values and their probabilities P. If the hidden variable description is correct, it must agree with the corresponding quantum theory in any situation where the quantum mechanical description allows measurements. In this case, the spins along a, b and c are not all simultaneously measurable according to the Heisenberg principle, so it is not possible to disprove hidden variable description simply by taking quantum measurements along a, b, and c and comparing their values to the ones in the table. Instead, observable variables must be discussed, which in this case are correlations. Suppose Alice measures the spin in the a direction and Bob measures it in the b direction. Denote the probability that Alice obtains +1/2 and Bob obtains +1/2 by :(2) P(a+, b+) = P3 \\\\+ P4 Similarly, if Alice measures spin in a direction and Bob measures in c direction, the probability that both obtain +1/2 is : (3) P(a+, c+) = P2 \\\\+ P4 Finally, if Alice measures spin in c direction and Bob measures in b direction, the probability that both obtain the value +1/2 is :(4) P(c+, b+) = P3 \\\\+ P7 The probabilities P are always non-negative, and therefore: :(5) P3 \\\\+ P4 ≤ P3 \\\\+ P4 \\\\+ P2 \\\\+ P7 This gives :(6) P(a+, b+) ≤ P(a+, c+) + P(c+, b+) which is a (rather trivial) Bell inequality. Evidently, it must be satisfied by any hidden variable theory because (in this case) the spin directions represent angular momenta, and a violation of the inequality would violate the conservation law. The quantum-mechanical prediction for the above setup is: :(7) P(a+, b+) = 1/2 (sin(a − b)/2)2. Bell's application of the inequality Bellpages 145–150 of his \\"Bertlmann's socks\\" article discusses the application of the inequality to thought-experiment involving the spin of electrons and Stern–Gerlach magnets. Evaluating the probabilities according to the quantum mechanical predictions, the inequality would imply e.g. :(8) 1/2 (sin 45°)2 ≤ 1/2 (sin 22.5°)2 \\\\+ 1/2 (sin 22.5°)2 or :(9) 0.2500 ≤ 0.1464 which is not true, proving his theorem. The prediction of quantum mechanics does indeed conflict with that of local realism. In real experiments, given that not all particles are detected, the above test could (as with the practical version of the CHSH Bell test) not legitimately be used unless the assumption is made that the detected particles are a fair sample of those emitted. The failure of this assumption results in the best known \\"loophole\\". When there are some non- detections, hidden variable theories exist that, like quantum mechanics, predict violation of the inequality. When the non-detections are indeed the correct explanation for experimental results, this would mean that quantum mechanics is in principle wrong in its predicting of the measurement outcomes, but accidentally exactly correct, when taking into account the detector efficiencies.

Being the only son of Hugh of Brienne and Isabella de la Roche, Walter was the sole heir to large estates in France, the Kingdom of Naples and the Peloponnese. He was held in custody in the Sicilian castle of Augusta between 1287 and 1296 or 1297 to secure the payment of his father's ransom to the Aragonese admiral, Roger of Lauria. When his father died fighting against Lauria in 1296, Walter inherited the County of Brienne in France, and the Counties of Lecce and Conversano in southern Italy. He was released, but he was captured during a Neapolitan invasion of Sicily in 1299. His second captivity lasted until the Treaty of Caltabellotta in 1302. Walter settled in France and married Joanna of Châtillon. After his cousin, Guy II, Duke of Athens, died childless in 1308, Walter laid claim to his inheritance. Their cousin, Eschiva of Ibelin, also claimed the duchy, but the High Court of Achaea passed a judgement in Walter's favor. Walter came to Athens in 1309. John II Doukas, the Greek Lord of Thessaly, made an alliance against him with the Byzantine Empire and the Despotate of Epirus. Walter hired the Catalan Company, a group of mercenaries, to invade Thessaly. The Catalans defeated John II, but Walter refused to pay their wages. After the Catalans rose up in open rebellion, Walter assembled a large army from Frankish Greece, but the Catalans inflicted a crushing defeat on the Franks in the Battle of Halmyros. Walter died in the battlefield and the Catalans occupied the Duchy of Athens.  Early life  Born around 1275, Walter was the only son of Hugh of Brienne and Isabella de la Roche. Hugh held important fiefs both in France (the county of Brienne), and in southern Italy (the counties of Lecce and Conversano). He had also claimed Cyprus, but the Cypriots elected his cousin, Hugh of Antioch- Lusignan, as King of Cyprus. Isabella de la Rochethe younger daughter of Guy I, Duke of Athensbrought Peloponnesian estates into the marriage. She died in 1279. Historian Guy Perry describes Walter as a \\"veritable child\\" of the War of the Sicilian Vespers (1282–1302). His father, who was a military commander of King Charles II of Naples, fell into captivity in the Battle of the Counts on 23 June 1287. Hugh was released only after he ceded Walter as a hostage to the Aragonese admiral, Roger of Lauria, to guarantee the payment of his ransom. Walter was kept in the fortress at Augusta for years. He most probably learnt Catalan and became familiar with the Aragonese customs during the years of his captivity. Walter was still held in custody when his father died fighting against Lauria at Brindisi in the summer of 1296. King Charles II ordered Hugh's southern Italian vassals to swear fealty to Walter on 27 August. After being released, Walter went to France and took possession of his father's French domains. He was invested with the County of Brienne before May 1297.  Warlike aristocrat  Seeking revenge for his father's death, Walter made an alliance with two French noblemen whose fathers had also been murdered in Italy. They hired 300 horsemen, who were known as the \\"Knights of Death\\", and joined the army that Charles II's heir, Robert, Duke of Calabria, had mustered to invade Sicily. Robert and his troops landed at Catania and occupied the town. Before long, rumours reached the Neapolitan camp, hinting that the castellan of Gagliano Castelferrato was willing to capitulate without resistance. Robert dispatched Walter and his retainers to the fortress to start negotiations with the castellan. The rumours proved false, deliberately spread to trap Neapolitan troops. After realizing the situation, Walter refused to flee and did battle against the Aragonese troops, but he was soon forced to surrender. Charles II appointed Philip of Toucy to administer Walter's southern Italian domains during his captivity. After the Treaty of Caltabellotta was signed in 1302, ending the War of the Sicilian Vespers, Walter was released. He went to France before June 1303. His subsequent marriage to Joanna of Châtillon, the daughter of the Constable of France, strengthened his position in France.  Duke of Athens  On 5 October 1308, the Duke of Athens, Guy II, died childless. His two cousins, Walter and Eschiva of Ibelin, laid claim to the duchy. Eschiva was the daughter of Alice de la Roche, who was the elder sister of Walter's mother, but the High Court of the Principality of Achaea—the feudal suzerain of Athens—ruled in Walter's favor, saying that the male claimant was to be preferred against a female if two relatives of equal degree claimed an inheritance. Before departing for Athens, Walter appointed his father-in-law, Gaucher V de Châtillon, to administer the County of Brienne. Walter landed at Glarentza in Achaea in the summer of 1309. By the time he reached Athens, John II Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, had got rid of Athenian suzerainty. The Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the actual ruler of Epirus, Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, supported John II, forcing Walter to seek external assistance. The Catalan Companya group of unemployed mercenarieshad made regular raids against Thessaly since 1305. Walter hired the Catalans and their Turkish allies to fight against the Greek rulers. The mercenaries invaded Thessaly and occupied important fortresses. After six months, John II was forced to sue for peace. Walter owed the mercenaries four months' salaries, but he did not want to pay the arrears. He selected 200 horsemen and 300 almogàvars (lightly-armed foot soldiers) from among the Catalans and promised only to them to pay their wages. He also offered fiefs to them and ordered all other Catalans to leave the duchy. The dismissed mercenaries refused to move and requested Walter to allow them to settle in the newly conquered lands as his vassals. Walter did not trust the Catalans and threatened them with capital punishment if they did not obey his commands. Having nowhere else to go, the disbanded mercenaries rose up in open rebellion. The 500 Catalan mercenaries whom Walter had just hired joined their compatriots, forcing Walter to seek assistance from Achaea and other parts of Frankish Greece. Walter's army met the Catalans in a marshy plain at Halmyros on 15 March 1311. The Catalans were willing to make peace, but Walter was determined to get rid of them. At the ensuing Battle of Halmyros, the Catalans won a devastating victory, killing Walter and almost all of his cavalry. The Catalans occupied the Duchy of Athens, and Walter's son, who was taken to Italy after the Catalans' victory, made unsuccessful attempts to regain it in the following decades. A Turkish soldier decapitated Walter's corpse and took his head in triumph from the battlefield. His son seized Walter's severed head and buried it in Lecce, most probably in the church of Sant'Oronzo, in 1348.

The epithet Nazarene was adopted by a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who aimed to revive spirituality in art. The name Nazarene came from a term of derision used against them for their affectation of a biblical manner of clothing and hair style. History In 1809, six students at the Vienna Academy formed an artistic cooperative in Vienna called the Brotherhood of St. Luke or Lukasbund, following a common name for medieval guilds of painters. In 1810 four of them, Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Franz Pforr, Ludwig Vogel and Johann Konrad Hottinger moved to Rome, where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by Philipp Veit, Peter von Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and a loose grouping of other German-speaking artists. They met up with Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827 they were joined by Joseph von Führich (1800-1876) (illustration above right). Joseph Anton Koch, Detail of the Dante-Cycle in the Casino Massimo The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They hoped to return to art which embodied spiritual values, and sought inspiration in artists of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, rejecting what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art. In Rome the group lived a semi-monastic existence, as a way of re-creating the nature of the medieval artist's workshop. Religious subjects dominated their output, and two major commissions allowed them to attempt a revival of the medieval art of fresco painting. Two fresco series were completed in Rome for the Casa Bartholdy (1816–17) (moved to the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin) and the Casino Massimo (1817–29), and gained international attention for the work of the \\"Nazarenes\\". However, by 1830 all except Overbeck had returned to Germany and the group had disbanded. Many Nazarenes became influential teachers in German art academies. Legacy The programme of the Nazarenes--the adoption of what they called honest expression in art and the inspiration of artists before Raphael--was to exert considerable influence in Germany, and in England upon the Pre-Raphaelite movement.Henri Dorra, Symbolist Art Theories: A Critical Anthology (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1995) p.17 They were also direct influences on the British artists William Dyce and Frederick Leighton and Ford Madox Brown.Neil MacMillan, Victorian Romantics (Vancouver: MacMillan & Perrin, 1979) p.1 Notable members * Peter von Cornelius * Josef Führich * Johann Konrad Hottinger * Johann Friedrich Overbeck * Franz Pforr * Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow * Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld * Eduard Jakob von Steinle * Philipp Veit * Johannes Veit * Ludwig Vogel * Eugene von Guerard Other painters associated with the movement *Carl Joseph Begas *Ernst Deger *Konrad Eberhard *Carl Eggers *Marie Ellenrieder *Gebhard Flatz *Matthias Goebbels *Josef von Hempel *Franz Theobald Horny *Franz Ittenbach *Gustav Jäger *Leopold Kupelwieser *Friedrich Lange *Ferdinand Olivier *Friedrich Olivier *Johann David Passavant *Carl Gottlieb Peschel *Johann Anton Ramboux *Theodor Rehbenitz *Johann Scheffer von Leonhardshoff *Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld *Johann von Schraudolph *Joseph Anton Settegast *Johann Michael Wittmer See also *Gabriel Wüger *German Romanticism *Middle Ages in history *Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood *Purismo Further reading * Mitchell Benjamin Frank.

Etymology The river's name comes from the Ojibwe misi-zaagi, \\"river with a wide mouth\\". Course The Mississagi River begins in a small unnamed lake in Sudbury District and flows south from that point to the border of Algoma District, then southeast through a north-east corner of the district, before returning once again to Sudbury District at White Owl Lake, from which it flows into Mississagi Lake at an elevation of . The river then turns south and heads to Kettle Lake, the furthest point east it reaches, before continuing south and entering Mississagi River Provincial Park at Upper Bark Lake at an elevation of . The river then continues south and crosses back into Algoma District, where it remains for the rest of its journey to Lake Huron, and enters the large \\"L\\"-shaped Bark Lake. It then heads west through Hellgate Rapids, takes in its right tributary the Abinette River at an elevation of , splits into two channels to form an island at , recombines at , and enters the large Rocky Island Lake at an elevation of , where the right tributary Cypress River enters. The Mississagi River then flows into Aubrey Lake, partially formed by the Aubrey Falls Generating Station (hydro) and dam, and where the Wenebegon Rivers joins. Not all the water is funnelled into the station, however; some continues to form the Aubrey Falls. The river turns south and the right tributary Aubinadong River enters, followed by two left tributaries, the Sharpsand River and the Rapid River in quick succession, and further on, another left tributary, Snowshoe Creek from Wakomata Lake. Then it reaches Tunnel Lake, formed by the George W Rayner Generating Station and Wells Generating Station and associated dams. The river then heads southeast where the left tributary Little White River enters, and continues to Red Rock Lake, created by the Red Rock Falls Generating Station and dam, over the Shino Rapids, takes in the right tributary Bolton River, then reaches the North Channel on Lake Huron. The river's delta is a \\"bird's foot\\" delta, a type not commonly found on the Great Lakes. The Mississippi River in Louisiana has a bird's foot delta.

In 1799, the North West Company built a fur trading post at the mouth of the river. This post was closed in 1900. During the second half of the 19th century, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills at Blind River. Economy Ontario Hydro constructed dams and four hydroelectric generating stations on the Mississagi River, Rayner G.S., Wells G.S., Red Rock Falls G.S., and Aubrey Falls G.S. between 1950 and 1970, which today are operated by Brookfield Asset Management. Historically, mining and forestry played a large role, but today tourism is the primary activity along the river. Highway 129 follows the river from Wharncliffe until the river turns east at Aubrey Falls. Ecology The lower river is an important spawning ground for lake sturgeon. Aubrey Falls Provincial Park is on the river at Aubrey Falls. Mississagi River Provincial Park encompasses the upper reaches of the river including Mississagi Lake.

Thymol also provides the distinctive, strong flavor of the culinary herb thyme, also produced from T. vulgaris. Chemistry Thymol is only slightly soluble in water at neutral pH, but it is extremely soluble in alcohols and other organic solvents. It is also soluble in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions due to deprotonation of the phenol. Thymol has a refractive index of 1.5208 and an experimental dissociation exponent (pKa) of .CAS Registry: Data obtained from SciFinder Thymol absorbs maximum UV radiation at 274 nm. =Chemical synthesis= Regions lacking natural sources of thymol obtain the compound via total synthesis. Thymol is produced from m-cresol and propene in the gas phase: : C7H8O + C3H6 C10H14O History Ancient Egyptians used thyme for embalming. The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage. The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to \\"give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs\\". In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan. In this period, women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves, as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals, as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life. The bee balms Monarda fistulosa and Monarda didyma, North American wildflowers, are natural sources of thymol. The Blackfoot Native Americans recognized these plants' strong antiseptic action, and used poultices of the plants for skin infections and minor wounds. A tisane made from them was also used to treat mouth and throat infections caused by dental caries and gingivitis. Thymol was first isolated by the German chemist Caspar Neumann in 1719. On page 324, Neumann mentions that in 1719 (MDCCXIX) he distilled some essential oils from various herbs. On page 326, he mentions that during the course of these experiments, he obtained a crystalline substance from thyme oil, which he called \\"Camphora Thymi\\" (camphor of thyme). (Neumann gave the name \\"camphor\\" not only to the specific substance that today is called camphor, but to any crystalline substance that precipitated from a volatile, fragrant oil from some plant.) In 1853, the French chemist A. Lallemand named thymol and determined its empirical formula. Thymol was first synthesized by the Swedish chemist Oskar Widman in 1882. Research An in vitro study found thymol and carvacrol to be highly effective in reducing the minimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics against zoonotic pathogens and food spoilage bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium SGI 1 and Streptococcus pyogenes ermB.. In vitro studies have found thymol to be useful as an antifungal against food spoilage and bovine mastitis. Thymol demonstrates in vitro post-antibacterial effect against the test strains E. coli and P. aeruginosa (gram negative), and Staphylococcus aureus and B. cereus (gram positive). This antibacterial activity is caused by inhibiting growth and lactate production, and by decreasing cellular glucose uptake. Thyme essential oil is useful in preservation of food. The antibacterial properties of thymol, a major part of thyme essential oil, as well as other constituents, are in part associated with their lipophilic character, leading to accumulation in bacterial membranes and subsequent membrane-associated events, such as energy depletion.Nychas G.J.E. In: Natural Antimicrobials from Plants. Gould G.W., editor. Blackie Academic Professional; London, UK: 1995. pp. 58–59. New Methods of Food Preservation. The antifungal nature of thymol against some fungi that are pathogenic to plants is due to its ability to alter the hyphal morphology and cause hyphal aggregates, resulting in reduced hyphal diameters and lyses of the hyphal wall. Uses Thymol Thymol has been used in alcohol solutions and in dusting powders for the treatment of tinea or ringworm infections, and was used in the United States to treat hookworm infections. People of the Middle East continue to use za'atar, a delicacy made with large amounts of thyme, to reduce and eliminate internal parasites. It is also used as a preservative in halothane, an anaesthetic, and as an antiseptic in mouthwash. When used to reduce plaque and gingivitis, thymol has been found to be more effective when used in combination with chlorhexidine than when used purely by itself. Thymol is also the active antiseptic ingredient in some toothpastes, such as Johnson & Johnson's Euthymol. Thymol has been used to successfully control varroa mites and prevent fermentation and the growth of mold in bee colonies, methods developed by beekeeper R. O. B. Manley. Thymol is also used as a rapidly degrading, non-persisting pesticide. Thymol can also be used as a medical disinfectant and general purpose disinfectant.

Synopsis A series of bizarre incidents sweep across Sweden: a man dies in front of an ATM, two young women slaughter an elderly taxi driver, a murder is committed aboard a Baltic Sea ferry, and a sub-station engineer makes a gruesome discovery while investigating the cause of a nationwide power cut. As Wallander investigates, he uncovers a sinister plan to bring the Western world to its knees. =Theme= The major background theme around which the action takes place is the dilemma of the Western economic system versus poverty. The criminal mastermind is a persuasive and talented IT specialist who plans to right the wrongs of the world by \\"deleting\\" vast quantities of money from multinational banks' accounts system, so bringing on a credit and financial panic. The criminals believe their intended cybercrime is justified; for them the \\"big picture\\" involves the sacrifice of the banking system in order to wipe out third world debt.

Located near the County Ground, home of Swindon Town F.C., its name comes from the popular children's television series The Magic Roundabout. In 2009 it was voted the fourth-scariest junction in Britain. History = Concept = The roundabout was constructed according to the design of Frank Blackmore, of the British Transport and Road Research Laboratory. Traffic flow around the inner circle is anticlockwise, and traffic flows in the usual clockwise manner around the five mini-roundabouts on the outer loop. = The roundabout = The complex junction offers multiple paths between feeder roads. The outer circle carries traffic in a clockwise direction, like a normal roundabout (in places where traffic drives on the left hand side of the road), and less proficient users may choose to use only the outer circle. The inner circle carries traffic in an anticlockwise direction, and more proficient users may choose to use the alternative paths. Virtually the same overall configuration has been in place for years. When the roundabout complex was first opened, the mini- roundabouts were not permanently marked out and could be reconfigured while the layout was fine tuned. A police officer was stationed at each mini roundabout during this pilot phase to oversee how drivers coped with the unique arrangement. The roundabout is built over a section of the old Wilts & Berks Canal—Swindon wharf. A narrow, stone bridge built , which is a grade II listed building, carried the old Saxon way known as Drove Road over the canal half a mile east of the town centre. Its site became covered by Drove Roundabout, which was later redeveloped as the Magic Roundabout. A wharf occupied one edge and the area was known as the Marsh. The Wilts & Berks Canal Trust are currently in negotiations with Swindon Council to include in the New Swindon Regeneration Framework plans to restore the canal through the town centre. The restoration would use the route of the North Wilts Canal and not the main West Vale route that the Magic Roundabout sits over. The North Wilts Canal was a separate branch which exited the town northwards through Moredon. The central circle and two mini-roundabouts A calendar is produced each year by the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society depicting the town's finest examples. The official name of the roundabout used to be County Islands, but it was changed in the late 1980s to match its popular name. In 2005, it was voted the worst roundabout in a survey of the general public by a UK insurance company. In September 2007, the Magic Roundabout was named as one of the world's worst junctions by a UK motoring magazine. In December 2007, BBC News reported a survey identifying The Magic Roundabout as one of the \\"10 Scariest Junctions in the United Kingdom\\"; however, the roundabout provides a better throughput of traffic than other designs and has an excellent safety record, since traffic moves too slowly to do serious damage in the event of a collision. In 2010, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program concluded that the roundabout reduces injurious crashes by three quarters. The roundabout in Drove Road is not the only one in Swindon that worked on the same principle; until recently, the roundabout at Bruce Street Bridges had a similar layout, but had only four entry/exit points. It was converted into a conventional roundabout in 2016.

In the 1870s it was one of the strongest sides in English football, winning the FA Cup in 1875 and being Cup Finalists in three of the first four seasons. The Engineers were pioneers of the ’combination game’, where teammates passed the ball to each other rather than kicking ahead and charging after the ball. With the rise of professional teams, in 1888 the Engineers joined a newly formed Army Football Association. History Merriman, Ord, Marindin, Addison, Mitchell; Front: Hoskyns, Renny-Tailyour, Creswell, Goodwyn, Barker, Rich. The club was founded in 1863, under the leadership of Major Francis Marindin. Sir Frederick Wall, who was the secretary of The Football Association 1895–1934, stated in his memoirs that the \\"combination game\\" was first used by the Royal Engineers A.F.C. in the early 1870s.Cox, Richard (2002) The Encyclopaedia of British Football, Routledge, United KingdomHistory of Football Wall states that the \\"Sappers moved in unison\\" and showed the \\"advantages of combination over the old style of individualism\\". Contemporary match reports confirm that passing was a regular feature of the Engineers' style. An 1869 report says they \\"worked well together\\" and \\"had learned the secret of football success – backing up\\"; whereas their defeated opponents had \\"a painful want of cooperation\\".Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 18 December 1869 In February 1871 against Crystal Palace it is noted that \\"Lieut. Mitchell made a fine run down the left, passing the ball to Lieut.

The Engineers used their team playing style with effect against the Wanderers, a side considered as early as 1870 to be the MCC of football.The Sporting Gazette of Saturday 12 March 1870, see account of international match of 5 March 1870 In a match of March 1871 against Wanderers their victory was due to \\"irreproachable organisation\\" and in particular that both their attacks and their backing up were both \\"so well organised\\"Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 18 March 1871, issue 2, 646 In November 1871 similar passing tactics are described in a contemporary account of a game against the Wanderers in which two goals were scored through tactical passing: \\"Betts, however, soon seized his opportunity, and by a brilliant run down the left wing turned the ball judiciously to Currie, who as judiciously sent it flying through the strangers' goal in first rate style\\"Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 18 November 1871, issue 2, 681 Later in the match it is reported that \\"Lieut G Barker, turning the ball to Lieut Renny-Tailyour who planted it between the posts\\" \\"Turning\\" the ball clearly points to the short pass. There is evidence that opponents sometimes adjusted their playing style to counteract the organisation and passing of the Engineers. For example, in February 1872 against Westminster School, a brief contemporary match report states that: \\"The school captain took the precaution of strengthening his backs, deputizing HDS Vidal to cooperate with Rawson and Jackson and so well did these three play in concert... they succeeded in defying the... RE forwards\\".Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 17 February 1872, issue 2694 What is most notable about this report is that it confirms that the Royal Engineers \\"played beautifully together\\" That the engineers were the first side to break the trend of dribbling is shown in a contemporary account of their victory against Crystal Palace in early 1872. This said that: \\"very little dribbling was displayed\\" FOOTBALL. Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), 16 March 1872; pg. 8; Issue 2698. New Readerships. The Engineers played in the first-ever FA Cup Final, losing 1–0 at Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872, to regular rivals Wanderers. They also lost the 1874 Final, to Oxford University A.F.C.. The Royal Engineers were the first football team to go on a tour, to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield in 1873. Wall's memoirs state that this tour introduced the combination game to Sheffield and Nottingham.Royal Engineers – Football – History In 1875 the Engineers won the FA Cup, considered their greatest triumph. In the final against Old Etonians, they drew 1–1 with a goal from Renny-Tailyour and went on to win the replay 2–0 with two further goals from Renny-Tailyour.When the Sappers won the FA Cup 1875 Royal Engineers Museum The winning side was: * Capt. W. Merriman; Lt. G.H. Sim; Lt. G.C. Onslow; Lt. R.M. Ruck; Lt. P.G. von Donop; Lt. C.K. Wood; Lt. H.E. Rawson; Lt. W.F.H. Stafford; Lt. H. W. Renny-Tailyour; Lt. A. Mein; and Lt. C. Wingfield-Stratford. Their last FA Cup Final appearance came in 1878, again losing to the Wanderers. They last participated in 1882–83 FA Cup, losing 6–2 in the fourth round to Old Carthusians F.C.. =Summary of the Royal Engineers early playing style= The evidence above contains detailed descriptions of passing that are lacking in reports of the 1872 Glasgow international. For example, in a lengthy account the Scotsman newspaper makes no mention of passing or combination by the Scottish team and specifically describes the Scottish attacks in terms of dribbling: \\"The Scotch now came away with a great rush, Leckie and others dribbling the ball so smartly that the English lines were closely besieged and the ball was soon behind\\"The Scotsman - 2 December 1872, page 6 and \\"Weir now had a splendid run for Scotland into the heart of his opponents' territory\\". Although the Scottish team are acknowledged to have worked better together during the first half, this contemporary account acknowledges that in the second half England played similarly: \\"During the first half of the game the English team did not work so well together, but in the second half they left nothing to be desired in this respect.\\" The Scotsman concludes that the difference in styles in the first half is the advantage the Queens' Park players had \\"through knowing each others' play\\" as all came from the same club. Unlike the 1872 Glasgow international, the contemporary evidence above shows that the Engineers' team playing style benefited their team play by winning games. Similarly, the 5 March 1872 match between Wanderers and Queens Park contains no evidence of ball passing.Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), 9 March 1872; Issue 2697 The early accounts all confirm that the Engineers were the first club to play a passing game of cooperation and organisation with both their forwards and their defence. Although they could also play rough – as would be expected for an army team – The Engineers are the first side to be considered to play the football \\"beautifully\\". All of these developments occurred before and independent of the 1872 match between England and Scotland. =Ireland= It was not only in England that the Engineers helped pioneer association football. While stationed in Ireland during the early 1900s the Royal Engineers, together with other British Army regimental teams organised and competed in local competitions. In 1902–03 the Engineers won the Munster Senior Cup. The regiment also entered teams in the Munster Senior League. =Later years= Professionalism arrived in Northern England in the 1880s, with the Football League starting in 1888. In the early years, the Engineers was one of several amateur teams who could defeat the professionals in challenge matches. The Army Football Association was formed in 1888. Its teams were organised by battalion, and later by regiment. The Engineers' Depot Battalion won the FA Amateur Cup in 1908.History Section - Welfare and Sports On 7 November 2012, the Royal Engineers played against the Wanderers in a rematch of the 1872 FA Cup Final at The Oval. Unlike the actual final, the Engineers won, and by a large margin, 7–1 being the final score. Ladies team In 2014, Keith Stubbs founded the REAFC Ladies squad which runs in line with the male squad.

The differences between Fortran, C, and even Java, although considerable, are ultimately constrained by all three being based on the programming style of the von Neumann computer. If, for example, Java objects were all executed in parallel with asynchronous message passing and attribute-based declarative addressing, then Java would not be in the group. The isomorphism between von Neumann programming languages and architectures is in the following manner: * program variables ↔ computer storage cells * control statements ↔ computer test-and-jump instructions * assignment statements ↔ fetching, storing instructions * expressions ↔ memory reference and arithmetic instructions. Criticism John Backus asserted that assignment statements in von Neumann languages split programming into two worlds. The first world consists of expressions, an orderly mathematical space with potentially useful algebraic properties: most computation takes place here. The second world consists of statements, a disorderly mathematical space with few useful mathematical properties (structured programming can be seen as a limited heuristic that does apply in this space, though). Backuslink no longer active. claimed that there exists now in computer science a vicious cycle where the long-standing emphasis on von Neumann languages has continued the primacy of the von Neumann computer architecture, and dependency on it has made non-von Neumann languages uneconomical and thus limited their further development: the lack of widely available and effective non-von Neumann languages has deprived computer designers of the motivation and the intellectual foundation needed to develop new computer architectures.IBM Archives: John Backus Presence in modern systems Many modern processors now contain multiple processing cores, and multi-threaded programming is usually the most efficient way to use more computational power in a single program. Some modern processors are highly optimized with techniques including out-of-order execution, but with complex logic to detect when this can be done without violating the von Neumann semantics of the logical programming model. Separate instruction and data caches are widely used, making the hardware a Modified Harvard architecture, but again with logic to detect cases where the optimization fails, to be able to execute self-modifying code. Some specialized processors (including GPUs) are very wide MIMD devices. General-purpose CPUs do commonly have multiple cores, but each one is fast enough that many programs are fast enough without parallelizing single tasks. (Threads are commonly used to deal with asynchronous inputs or outputs, especially in a GUI.) General-purpose CPUs are technically MIMD devices, but usually only hardware designed from the ground up for MIMD programming is referred to as MIMD. Many widely used programming languages such as C, C++ and Java have ceased to be strictly von Neumann by adding support for parallel processing, in the form of threads. However, most of the categorically non-von Neumann languages are also functional languages and have not achieved widespread use.

The BBC sold the majority of buildings on the site in 2015 and it was renamed White City Place by owners Stanhope and Mitsui Fudosan. BBC White City White City One in 2013 The first building on the site, BBC White City, was designed by architects Scott Brownrigg & Turner and was opened in 1990. Built on the site of the 1908 Franco-British exhibition, White City was constructed on the location of the former White City Stadium (The Great Stadium) used for the 1908 Summer Olympics. The stadium was demolished in 1985 and parts of the Olympic swimming pool were also discovered when the foundations of the new building were laid. The building was originally intended to be a new home for BBC Radio, replacing Broadcasting House.Glenn Aylett https://www.transdiffusion.org/2005/01/01/bbc_2 BBC Infrastructure, Transdiffusion 1 January 2005 This plan was scrapped and the building instead became office space with fifty edit suites, various Television production teams, the Digital Switchover team, BBC Academy, the Children in Need charity and parts of Operations and HR, as well as a large restaurant. It housed most of the BBC's current affairs and factual and learning programmes, such as Panorama, Top Gear (where it featured in a segment about the Peel P50The Smallest Car in the World at the BBC, Top Gear series 10, episode 3), Watchdog and many others.

Before his elevation to the royal dignity, Vratislaus had ruled Bohemia as duke since 1061. On his father's death in 1055, Vratislaus became duke of Olomouc, whereas his older brother became Duke of Bohemia as Spytihněv II. He fell out with his brother and was exiled to Hungary. Vratislaus regained the ducal throne of Olomouc with Hungarian assistance and eventually reconciled with his brother, then succeeded him as duke of Bohemia when he died in 1061. Campaigns of Henry IV Both Pope Alexander II and Pope Gregory VII confirmed Vratislaus in the privilege of wearing the mitre and tunic which his predecessors had. Despite this, Vratislaus supported Henry in both the Investiture Controversy against the popes and the rebellions in Saxony that dominated his long reign. These actions would negate the significance of the mitre. Vratislaus was often at odds with his brother Jaromír, the bishop of Prague. Jaromír, for his part, ignored the creation of a new Moravian diocese in Olomouc by Vratislaus in 1063. Jaromir even went so far as to retake, by arms, the relics removed from Prague and taken to Moravia. Despite the pope's support for Vratislaus' new see, the Bohemian duke was unswayed in his loyalty to the emperor. The Saxons revolted under Duke Magnus of Saxony and Otto of Nordheim, Duke of Bavaria, in 1070 and Boleslaus of Poland attacked Bohemia in 1071. In August 1073, Henry responded with an invasion of Poland, but a new Saxon revolt drew him back in 1075. Vratislaus joined him, and they defeated the rebels on 9 June at the First Battle of Langensalza. The Bohemian troops showed conspicuous bravery. Henry then took Jaromír to Germany to be his chancellor under the name of Gebhard and Vratislaus was greatly relieved. Vratislaus also took part in the wars against the anti-kings who opposed Henry's rule and were elected by a faction of the nobility to replace him. At the Battle of Flarchheim, only through the aid of Vratislaus' contingent was the imperial army capable of overcoming the rebels of the papally-approved claimant Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Duke of Swabia. Vratislaus even succeeded in seizing Rudolf's golden lance. The golden lance was then carried in front of Vratislaus on state occasions. Relations with the papacy Vratislaus raised an army to serve in Henry's Italian campaign of 1081. In 1083, Vratislaus and his Bohemians were with Henry when they entered Rome itself. Despite his serving an excommunicated emperor, Vratislaus maintained good relations with the papacy. Nonetheless, Gregory refused to grant Vratislaus permission to use the Slavonic liturgy. Never, however, did Vratislaus link his fate with that of Henry's antipope, Clement III. Expansionism Denar of Vratislaus II. Vratislaus coveted the largely Slavic marches of Meissen and Lusatia, but, in spite of Henry's promises and Bohemian successes against the rebellious margraves, he never received them. He held Lower Lusatia between 1075 and 1086, but in 1088, with the insurrection of Egbert II of Meissen, Henry granted the region to Henry of Ostmark. Vratislaus was thereafter cool to Henry's military adventures. He never wavered in his loyalty, but he abstained from giving the emperor martial aid. Internal affairs It was a Přemyslid tradition that Moravia would be entrusted to the younger brothers of the ruling prince. In Vratislaus' case, his two younger brothers Conrad and Otto inherited Brno and Olomouc and the youngest, Jaromír, entered the church. However, enmity grew between the brothers. It was then that Vratislaus founded the diocese of Olmütz (diocese of Olomouc), under the Archbishopric of Mainz, to counter Otto's authority within his province. Both pope and emperor took a hand in mediating the conflict, which was partially fixed with Henry's appointment of Jaromír as chancellor in 1077. In April 1085, a reichstag convened in Mainz suppressed the Moravian see, but Vratislaus later re-founded see. Jaromír protested in Rome to Pope Urban II, but died in 1090 before a pope ruled on the matter. Sadly for Vratislaus, his last years were occupied by dynastic quarrelling. When his brother Otto died in 1086, he gave Olomouc to his son Boleslaus, which was seen to be an act against the interests of Conrad. Vratislaus raised an army against Conrad and sent it out under his other son Bretislaus. This son turned on him. Vratislaus, in keeping with Bohemian custom, designated an heir: Conrad. Thus reconciled, the two attacked Bretislaus, who fled to Hungary. Vratislaus died of a hunting wound on 14 January 1092 after a reign of thirty years. He was buried in St. Peter and Paul′s Church, Vyšehrad.František Palacký: Dějiny národa českého v Čechách i v Moravě, book III Legacy Vratislaus frequently found himself in conflict with Bishop Jaromír of Prague and sought means to diminish the importance of the Bishop of Prague in domestic Bohemian politics. Among the actions he took were the re-establishment of the Bishopric of Olomouc in 1063 and the creation of the Vyšehrad Chapter in 1070. The latter was richly endowed independently of the Prague bishop, subject instead to the Holy See directly. His success in curbing the power of the Prague bishop helped to strengthen the Bohemian crown and enable later rulers to govern a more unified state. His policy towards the Holy Roman Empire set an example that would be followed in the twelfth century and would ultimately lead to the permanent elevation of Bohemia to the status of a kingdom at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The marriage alliances he was able to conclude with notable foreign princesses reflected the rising position of the Přemyslids among European dynasties. In contrast, Vratislaus's father Bretislaus in 1019 had to abduct his wife, the minor noblewoman Judith of Schweinfurt, to secure any suitable consort at all. His successor continued to cultivate dynastic bonds with notable courts in central and eastern Europe. Family Vratislaus was married three times. His first wife Maria died during premature childbirth. He married the second time in 1057 to Adelaide, daughter of Andrew I of Hungary, who died in 1061. They had four children: *Vratislaus (-1061) *Judith (1056/58-1086), married to Ladislaus I Herman, son of Casimir I of Poland *Ludmila (-after 1100) *Bretislaus II of Bohemia (c. 1060–December 22, 1100), Duke of Bohemia In 1062, Vratislaus married a third time to Swatawa of Poland, a daughter of Casimir I of Poland. They had five children: *Boleslaus (-1091) *Bořivoj II of Bohemia (c. 1064-February 2, 1124), Duke of Bohemia *Vladislaus I of Bohemia (-April 12, 1125), Duke of Bohemia *Soběslav I of Bohemia (-February 14, 1140), Duke of Bohemia *Judith (c. 1066-9 December 1108), married to Wiprecht II of Groitzsch  Notes  References  * * Literature *Vratislav Vaníček: Vratislav II.

It is a sexually dimorphic species with larger males that carry larger, curved horns. Their coat colour is typically brownish grey. Alpine ibex tend to live in steep, rough terrain near the snow line. They are also social, although adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. Four distinct groups exist; adult male groups, female-offspring groups, groups of young individuals, and mixed-sex groups. During the breeding season, males fight for access to females and use their long horns in agonistic behaviours. After being extirpated from most areas by the 19th century, the Alpine ibex was successfully reintroduced to parts of its historical range. All individuals living today descend from the stock in Gran Paradiso National Park in Aosta Valley (Italy). This national park was created to help the ibex to thrive. The ibex is the emblem of both the Gran Paradiso National Park and the contiguous Vanoise National Park across the French border. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN, but went through a population bottleneck of less than 100 individuals. This has led to very low genetic diversity across populations. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Alpine ibex was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It is classified in the genus Capra (Latin for \\"goat\\") with at least seven other species of wild goats. Both Capra and Ovis (sheep) descended from a goral-like animal from the Miocene and early Pliocene, whose fossils are found in Kenya, China, and Slovenia. The genus Tossunnoria appears in China during the late Miocene and appears to have been intermediate between gorals and goats. Fossils of Alpine ibex date back to the late Pleistocene, when the Spanish ibex and it probably evolved from the extinct Pleistocene species Capra camburgensis. The Nubian (C. nubiana), Walia (C. walie), and Siberian ibex (C. sibirica) were previously considered to be subspecies of the Alpine ibex, giving populations in the Alps the trinomial of C. i. ibex. Appearance Video of a herd of Alpine ibex on Augstmatthorn in the Bernese Highlands, Switzerland Compared with other members of its genus, the Alpine ibex has a short, broad head and a duller coat. It has brownish-grey hair over most of the body, a pale abdomen, and slightly darker markings on the chin and throat and in a stripe along the back. They moult twice a year, firstly in April or May, and then again in September, when they replace the short summer coat with thicker hair and a woolly undercoat. Males commonly grow to a height of at the withers, with a body length of and weigh from . Females are noticeably smaller, with a shoulder height of , a body length of , and a weight of . Both male and female Alpine ibex have large, backwards-curving horns with numerous ridges along their length. At , those of the males are substantially larger than those of females, which reach only in length. Distribution and ecology Ibex standing on cliff in winter The Alpine ibex was, at one point, restricted only to the Gran Paradiso National Park in northern Italy, and in the Maurienne Valley in the French Alps but it was reintroduced to most of the European Alps. Reintroductions started in 1906 into Switzerland. Alpine ibex are now found in most or all of the Italian and French alpine ranges, southern Germany, Switzerland Heinz Staffelbach, Manuel des Alpes suisses. Flore, faune, roches et météorologie, Rossolis, 2009 (). Also available in German: Heinz Staffelbach, Handbuch Schweizer Alpen. Pflanzen, Tiere, Gesteine und Wetter, Haupt Verlag, 2008 (). and Austria. It has also been introduced to Bulgaria and Slovenia. An excellent climber, its preferred habitat is the rocky region along the snow line above alpine forests, where it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of . Alpine ibex are typically absent from woodland areas, although adult males in densely populated areas may stay in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland if no snow has fallen. Males spend the winter in coniferous forests. For most of the year, males and females occupy different habitats. Females rely on steep terrain more so than males.Francisci, F., S. Focardi, and L. Boitani. (1985) \\"Male and female Alpine ibex: phenology of space use and herd size\\", pp. 124–133. in The biology and management of mountain ungulates. Lovari, S. Croom Helm. London, United Kingdom. Males use lowland meadows during the spring, which is when snow melts and green grass appears. They then climb to alpine meadows during the summer. When winter arrives, both sexes move to steep, rocky slopes that amass little snow. They prefer slopes of 30–45° and use small caves and overhangs for shelter. Home ranges are highly variable, depending on the availability of resources, and vary in size throughout the year. Figures from have been recorded. Home ranges tend to be largest during summer and autumn, smallest in winter, and intermediate in spring. Female home ranges are usually smaller than those of males. Alpine ibex appear to have a low rate of predation and in Gran Paradiso typically die of age, starvation, or disease. =Foraging= Alpine ibex are strictly herbivorous, with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the remainder being a mixture of mosses, flowers, leaves, and twigs. If leaves and shoots are out of reach, they often stand on their rear legs to reach this food. Grass genera that are the most commonly eaten are Agrostis, Avena, Calamagrostis, Festuca, Phleum, Poa, Sesleria, and Trisetum. The climbing ability of the Alpine ibex is such that it has been observed standing on the sheer face of the Cingino Dam in Piedmont, Italy, where it licks the stonework to obtain mineral salts. Life history Although the Alpine ibex is a social species, they segregate sexually and spatially depending on the season. Four types of groups exist: Adult male groups, female-offspring groups, groups of young individuals 2–3 years old, and mixed-sex groups. Young groups are numerous at the beginning of summer, but are expelled by females at the end of their gestation period. Female and offspring groups occur year-round, at least in an area of the French Alps. Mixed sex groups of adult males and females occur during breeding, which lasts from December to January. By April and May, the adults separate. The largest aggregations of either sex occur during June and July. Gatherings of males begin to decrease during October and November, and are lowest from the rut from December to March. The males then leave their separate wintering areas and gather again. Male ibex locking horns A linear dominance hierarchy exists among males. In small populations, which are more cohesive, males know their place in the hierarchy based on memories of past encounters, while in mobile and large groups, where encounters with strangers are common, rank is based on horn size.Schaller, G. B. (1977) Mountain monarchs: wild sheep and goats of the Himalaya. University of Chicago Press. Chicago, Illinois. Antagonistic behavior in males can come in the form of \\"direct\\" or \\"indirect\\" aggression. With direct aggression, one male bumps another with his horns or places himself in front of his opponent. He stands on his hind legs and comes down on his opponent with his horns. This may signal that he is ready to clash or may be attempting a real clash. Indirect aggression is mostly intimidation displays. Mother with young =Reproduction and growth= The breeding season starts in December, and typically lasts around six weeks. During this time, male herds break up into smaller groups that search for females. The rut takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the male groups interact with the females that are all in oestrous. The higher the male's rank, the closer he can get to a female. Males perform courtship displays. In the second phase of the rut, one male separates from his group to follow an individual female. He displays to her and guards her from other males. Before copulation, the female moves her tail and courtship becomes more intense. They copulate and then he rejoins his group and reverts to the first phase. Gestation lasts around 167 days, and results in the birth of one or two kids, with twins making up about 20% of births. Alpine ibex reach sexual maturity at 18 months, but females do not reach their maximum body size for five to six years, and males not for 9–11 years. The horns grow throughout life, growing most rapidly during the second year of life, and thereafter by about a year, eventually slowing to half that rate once the animal reaches 10 years of age. Alpine ibex live for up to 19 years in the wild. Conservation status Young Alpine ibex on a cliff The Alpine ibex historically ranged through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 16th century and with firearms becoming common, the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching. The ibex became extinct in Switzerland and Germany by the 18th century, and was extinct in Austria and northeastern Italy by the 19th century. They remained only in and around the adjacent Gran Paradiso and Vanoise Massifs, then both part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Located in the western Italian Alps and the Maurienne valley in the north eastern French alps, bordering the Vanoise and Gran Paradiso Massif, the park was declared a royal hunting reserve in 1854 with the name of \\"Royal hunting reserve of Gran Paradiso\\" by Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of a united Italy. Ibex were protected from poaching and their numbers increased, reaching 3,020 in 1914. The ibex enjoyed further protection when Gran Paradiso was made into a national park in 1922. Animals from this population naturally dispersed into surrounding regions. However, reintroductions have been the predominant source of new populations. Today, the total population of Alpine ibex is over 30,000 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN. However, Alpine ibex do have low genetic diversity putting them at risk of inbreeding depression.

It reports a membership of over 330,000 members organized in 2,200 local chapters (lodges), state lodges, and the national Grand Lodge. The organization attempts to improve the working conditions of law enforcement officers and the safety of those they serve through education, legislation, information, community involvement, and employee representation.\\"Frequently Asked Questions .\\" Fraternal Order of Police. June 19, 2020. FOP subordinate lodges may be police unions and/or fraternal organizations, as the FOP has both Labor Lodges and Fraternal Lodges, and describes itself as a \\"full service member representation organization.\\" It lobbies Congress and regulatory agencies on behalf of law enforcement officers, provides labor representation, promotes legal defense for officers, and offers resources such as legal research. It also sponsors charities such as Easter Seals, Special Olympics, memorials for fallen officers, and support programs for spouses and family members of police officers. History Fort Pitt Lodge # 1, Pittsburgh The Fraternal Order of Police was founded in 1915 by two Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, patrol officers, Martin Toole and Delbert Nagle. They and 21 other members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police met on May 14, 1915, establishing the first local of the Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge #1.\\"History .\\" Fraternal Order of Police. The FOP official history states that the founders decided to not use the term \\"union\\" because of \\"the anti-union sentiment of the time,\\" but nevertheless acted as a union, telling Pittsburgh mayor Joseph G. Armstrong that the FOP would \\"bring our grievances before the Mayor or Council and have many things adjusted that we are unable to present in any other way...we could get many things through our legislature that our Council will not, or cannot give us.\\" In 1918, it was decided that the Order should become a national organization. The Order's constitution stated that \\"Race, Creed or Color shall be no bar\\". The constitution also had a no strike pledge, but this has not been enforced since 1967 when FOP police in Youngstown, Ohio refused to work during a salary dispute. In 1974 and 1975 the FOP stated that it would take no action against members who violated the anti-strike clause until all efforts were exhausted on the local and state level.Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations Westport, CT; Greenwood Press pp.263-4 During the 1960s the FOP opposed the creation of police review boards, spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, at one point describing them as a \\"sinister movement against law enforcement\\". The FOP also clashed with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on the issue of police brutality, seeing it as a \\"liberal attempt to discredit law enforcement\\". The Order was \\"heartened by Richard Nixon's emphasis on law and order\\", though it claimed to remain strictly apolitical.Schmidt p.264 Emblem and motto The Fraternal Order of Police emblem is a five-pointed star. According to the FOP: When adopted, the motto was believed to be Latin and assumed to mean \\"Fairness, Justice, Equality\\" or \\"Justice, Friendship, Equality\\". Actually, the motto is a grammatically impossible and hardly translatable sequence of Latin words; the current interpretation is the best that could be made of it.Justin E. Walsh, Ph.D. Fraternal Order of Police 1915—1976: A History. Turner Publishing Company, 2004, pp. 18–20. . In the center of the star is the coat of arms of the City of Pittsburgh.  Organization and membership The FOP constitution and bylaws provide that active membership is open to \\"any regularly appointed or elected and full-time employed law enforcement officer of the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, or any agency may be eligible for membership\\" and that \\"each state and subordinate lodge shall be the judge of its membership.\\" Local lodges often have provisions for retired law enforcement officers.\\"How to Join .\\" Fraternal Order of Police. The subordinate lodges are supported by state lodges which are subordinate to the Grand Lodge. The Grand Lodge is the national structure of the order.Schmidt p.265 In 1978, the Order had 138,472 members, 1,250 lodges and 34 state structures. In the late 1970s, the Order's headquarters were located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The national organization has three offices: the Labor Services Division in Columbus, Ohio, the Steve Young Law Enforcement Legislative Advocacy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Grand Lodge \\"Atnip- Orms Center\\" National Headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee.\\"Contact Us .\\" Fraternal Order of Police. =Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary= The Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary (FOPA) is the auxiliary organization of FOP for family members of FOP members. It was formed by a group of wives of Pittsburgh police officers in 1920, and Kathryn M. Milton became its first national president, in 1941 as the Fraternal Order of Police Ladies Auxiliary. It reports over 2,000 members in 140 Auxiliaries in 25 states. In 1985, non- female members older than 18 were admitted for the first time; in 1987, the current name was adopted, dropping the term \\"Ladies.\\"\\"Auxiliary .\\" Fraternal Order of Police. =Fraternal Order of Police Associates= The Fraternal Order of Police Associates (FOPA) is a civilian affiliate organization that is made up of FOP supporters not eligible for membership.

It is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.\\"Fraternal Order of Police Associates .\\" Fraternal Order of Police. Political advocacy Passed legislation supported by FOP includes the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act, and HELPS Retirees Act. Pending legislation that FOP lobbies for include the Social Security Fairness Act, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007, and the State and Local Law Enforcement Officers' Discipline, Accountability and Due Process Act. The FOP distributes questionnaires for candidates for U.S. president and Congress asking them about their views on issues relating to police officers.\\"Congressional Candidate Questionnaire: Model Questionnaire for use by State and Local Lodges .\\" Fraternal Order of Police.\\"Fraternal Order of Police Presidential Questionnaire: John McCain Response .\\" Fraternal Order of Police.\\" Fraternal Order of Police Presidential Questionnaire: Barack Obama Response .\\" Fraternal Order of Police.

On September 16, 2016, the FOP endorsed Republican Party candidate Donald Trump for U.S. president. It did so again on September 4, 2020. =Boycotts= The National Fraternal Order of Police has called for boycotts of various individuals and organizations throughout its history. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for a boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981. FOP also called for a boycott of the Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine for their support of Abu-Jamal. In August 2007, FOP called for a boycott of eBay for selling police equipment. In 2015, the Fraternal Order of Police called for a boycott of Quentin Tarantino's films following his comments against police brutality at a protest in New York. The boycott of Tarantino was joined by the Border Patrol, as well as police unions in California, Philadelphia, New York, and New Jersey. After athletic company Nike aired an ad featuring former NFL player Colin Kaepernick in 2018, FOP condemned it and called it an insult. Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury said Kaepernick's views were \\"uninformed and inflammatory\\" but declined to call for a boycott, saying that \\"in our experience, boycotts and similar exercises do not succeed and often serve only to enrich the company.\\" Aside from the national organization, many local police unions have separately called for boycotts. =Opposition to corporate welfare= In November 2018, the Nashville chapter of the FOP criticized Mayor David Briley's decision to give $15 million in tax incentives to Amazon, partly owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, but no wage increase for them. The FOP explained that many police officers cannot afford to live in Nashville and have to take extra jobs due to their low wages. The mayor dismissed the criticism as two separate issues, but the FOP added, \\"Saying that these two matters are separate does nothing to ensure the long term welfare of our employees.\\" The FOP called it \\"corporate welfare,\\" and they supported a resolution by council members that would have ensured the tax incentives only went through if government workers received a pay raise.  Data breach  In January 2016, the site was hacked and files released to a dark web activist known as Cthulhu. Controversies Front door of a Providence spa with multiple police stickers In 1991, the FOP was under scrutiny from the public in part because of the Rodney King incident. Dewey Stokes, the FOP president at the time, contextualized the incident by saying, \\"You have to put things in proper perspective. [...] These are not common occurrences. They are the result of stress on the job, emphasis of the system on the criminal and not the victim, and the media's exploitation of the negatives of law enforcement.\\" The human rights group Amnesty International has criticized the Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia for their vocal support of the death penalty in the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has called the FOP a \\"fringe organization\\" for opposing his efforts to repeal the Tiahrt Amendment. On September 18, 2009, the Providence Journal reported the Fraternal Order of Police representing several Rhode Island police departments had solicited donations from city massage parlors or \\"spas\\". Watchdog groups have claimed that these massage parlors are fronts for prostitution. On August 27, 2017, as the FOP was holding its annual conference at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, protesters compared the FOP to the Ku Klux Klan by putting up banners on interstate overpasses, one of which read, \\"Grand Wizards to Grand Lodges. White Supremacy By Another Name\\". In June 2018, Fraternal Order of Police Tri-County Lodge #3 in South Carolina objected to the inclusion of award-winning novel The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, and All American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely in a high school summer reading list, because of their depictions of violence by police officers. The National Coalition Against Censorship offered the high school support, while prominent authors such as Hari Kunzru and Neil Gaiman pointed out the alarming nature of police officers trying to police what children read. After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody, the FOP said, in part: \\"...police officers should at all times render aid to those who need it... need to treat all of our citizens with respect and understanding and should be held to the very highest standards for their conduct...\\" In June 2020, the Fraternal Order of Police's Brevard County, Florida chapter offered on Facebook to recruit police officers from forces involved in police brutality controversies from Buffalo, Atlanta, and Minneapolis. The Brevard County sheriff denounced the remarks. See also * Fraternal Order of Police v.

Life Vladislav I was a son of Vratislaus II of Bohemia by his second wife Svatava, a daughter of Casimir I of Poland. Together with his cousin Svatopluk, Vladislav expelled his brother Bořivoj II from Bohemia in 1107. In 1109, Svatopluk was killed during a campaign in Poland, and Vladislav I succeeded him as Duke of Bohemia. Bořivoj II returned from exile with the support of Prince Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland, but was defeated and imprisoned by Vladislav in 1110. In spite of his victory, Vladislav I remained under Polish pressure and was forced to recognize a younger brother, Soběslav, as subordinate ruler of Moravia in Znojmo. In 1117, Vladislav I formally abdicated in favor of Bořivoj II, but retained much of the actual power. In 1120, Bořivoj was deposed again and endowed with Znojmo, while Vladislav resumed the throne, which he held until his death in 1125. Vladislav I ruled in a difficult time with considerable success. Although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, he weathered the interventions of Poland into Bohemian affairs, conflicts with his kinsmen in Moravia, and undertook offensive campaigns against both Poland and Austria. In 1110-11, Vladislav accompanied Emperor Henry V on his Italian expedition, and he encouraged continued German settlement into Bohemia's border regions. Abbey Kladruby In 1115, the Benedictine abbey of Kladruby, west of Pilsen, was established, with Vladislav endowing the abbey with 25 manors and the lordship of Zbraslav.

He is noted for his promotion of the Daf Yomi study program in 1923, and establishing the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva in 1930. During the years 1922 to 1927 Shapiro was the first Orthodox Jew to become a member in the Sejm (Parliament) of the Second Polish Republic representing the Jewish minority of the country. Biography =Early years= Chortkov Yehuda Meir Shapiro was born on the 7th day of Adar (in Jewish tradition, also the birth date of Moses) in the city of Shatz, Bucovina, then in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, now in Romania, in 1887. He was a descendant of Rabbi Pinchas Shapiro of Korets, one of the students of the Baal Shem Tov, and from his maternal side, of Rabbi Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor, a French tosafist. After cheder, Shapiro began to study with his grandfather, the Baal Minchas Shai (Rabbi Shmuel Yitzhak Schor). Another of his early teachers was Rabbi Shulem Moshkovitz (popularly known as the Shotzer Rebbe. He was also a well known kabbalist). Shapiro began to get a reputation, and became known as the Illui of Shatz. From an early age, he was known as an outstanding leader and gifted speaker. He was soon ordained by many great scholars, including the Maharsham. His grandfather introduced him to the Chortkover Rebbe, and thus began his passion for Hasidism, and the beginning of his relationship with the Chortkover Rebbe. =Galina= His first rabbinical posting came in 1911 when he was appointed Rav of Galina. He spent ten years in the city, during which time he established a yeshiva called Bnei Torah. Construction commenced in 1920. The yeshiva held a Talmud Torah, a place to train rabbis, and a kitchen to feed orphaned children. It ran at a budget of over half a million marks. This yeshiva served as a prototype for what was later to become Chachmei Lublin. =Sanok= After leaving Galina, Shapiro began serving as Rav of Sanok in 1920. =Petrakov= In 1924, Shapiro accepted his third rabbinical position in Petrakov/Piotrkow. =Lublin= On 14 June 1931, he was appointed rabbi of Lublin in the old synagogue of the Maharshal. Daf Yomi Shapiro introduced the revolutionary idea of Daf Yomi (, \\"page [of the] day\\" or \\"daily folio\\"), a daily regimen undertaken to study the Babylonian Talmud one folio (a daf consists of both sides of the page) each day. Under this regimen, the entire Talmud is completed, one day at a time, in a cycle of seven and a half years. Rabbi Shapiro introduced his idea at the First World Congress of the World Agudath Israel in Vienna on 16 August 1923.Shlomi, B. \\"A Brilliant Idea: Daf Yomi\\". Hamodia Magazine, 3 May 2012, pp. 18-20. The first cycle of Daf Yomi commenced on the first day of Rosh Hashanah 5684 (11 September 1923). Now in its 14th cycle, Daf Yomi has been taken up by tens of thousands of Jews worldwide. Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva. Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin was, along with Daf Yomi, Shapiro's greatest achievement. He conceived of a yeshiva for Hasidic Poland, modeled on Lithuanian yeshivas such as Volozhin, Slabodka and Novardok, but which would train Hasidic rabbis as the next generation to lead Polish Jewry. The Yeshiva was housed in a massive building, housed hundreds of students, and had a vast library of over 100,000 books. On May 22–28, 1924, the cornerstone laying ceremony took place for the construction of the yeshiva building. Approximately 20,000 people participated in the event. The opening ceremony took place on June 24–25, 1930. Apart from thousands of local Jews, around 10,000 people arrived from all over Poland and abroad. Shapiro served as rosh yeshiva until his death. Łódź In 1932 Shapiro was approached by leaders of the Jewish Community of Łódź, who wanted to offer him the position of Chief Rabbi of Łódź. Many people wanted to appoint Rabbi Mendel Alter of Kalish, (b. 1877, Ger) the brother to the Gerrer Rebbe (and youngest son of the Sfas Emes) to this position. Rabbi Shapiro negotiated that a large part of his wage would go to pay off the debts that Chachmei Lublin was still struggling to pay off. Eventually it was decided to give it to Rabbi Shapiro. After all the protracted negotiation that went on to get Rabbi Shapiro into this position, he died three days after being appointed Chief Rabbi. Political activities =Agudat Yisrael= Whilst serving in Galina, Rabbi Shapiro began his involvement with Agudat Israel. He was present at its founding conference in 1912. In 1914 he was appointed head of the Education Department of Agudas Yisrael in East Galicia, becoming president in 1922 of Agudas Yisrael in Poland. He played a role in the conference in the city of Lvov, which had the purpose of launching the Aguda in Galicia, some two years after its founding in Katovitz in 5672 (c. 1911). At the time, he was also added as a member to the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. Rabbi Shapiro was initially very doubtful as to whether he should become an MP for the party, but was encouraged to do so by his rebbe, the Chortkover. Rabbi Shapiro, together with Aron Levine and Zalman Sorotzkin, chaired the committee which as a part of the Polish Ministry for Religious Affairs, held responsibility for delegating Rabbinical positions throughout Poland. He was also part of the Vaad HaChinuch. Beginning in 1922, Rabbi Shapiro served as a parliamentarian to the Polish Sejm. In 1928 he stepped down as a politician so that he could devote all his energies to Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva. Death Shapiro became ill with typhus in 1933 and died within the month, on 27 October 1933 (7 Cheshvan 5694) at the age of 46. His death was mourned in both Jewish and non- Jewish Poland. Countless newspapers across the entire political spectrum, from Orthodox to Yiddishist to socialist, featured front-page biographies of Rabbi Shapiro. Shapiro's remains were reinterred in Israel in 1958, under the auspices of his brother. He was reburied in Har HaMenuchot with a full ceremony. Rabbi Yitzchok Meir Levin delivered a eulogy, as did those students of his who had survived the Holocaust. Legacy Shapiro is widely revered throughout the Jewish world as the founder of Daf Yomi. The neighborhood of Zikhron Meir in Bnei Brak was established in his memory by Yaakov Halperin; this is the neighborhood that hosts many of the major yeshivas in Bnei Brak. Shlomo Artzi, a famous Israeli musical artist, is Shapiro's grand-nephew. Famous students of Rav Shapiro who continued his legacy, include rabbi Pinchas Hirschprung and rabbi Shmuel halevi Wosner . Works Shapiro was considered a gaon (Torah genius) in his lifetime. He studied Torah extensively and was a great scholar even by the high standards of the era he lived in. His two major works are Ohr HaMeir and Imrei Da'as. *Ohr HaMeir - It was in Petrakov that he printed his book of responsa entitled Ohr HaMeir in 1926. As a work it operates on many different subjects, from philosophy to halacha. *Imrei Daas - a compilation of Torah thoughts on Halacha and Aggada, which was lost during World War II. The book contained an approbation from Rabbi Meir Arik of Meturnah. *Vortelach - Shapiro was a quick and brilliant thinker, and his numerous vortelach (short responsa) have been collected in numerous volumes, and quoted in many books.

It was her last work, first staged at the Royal Court's Jerwood Theatre Upstairs on 23 June 2000, directed by James Macdonald, nearly one and a half years after Kane's death on 20 February 1999. The play has no explicit characters or stage directions; this continues the style of her previous production entitled Crave. Stage productions of the play vary greatly, therefore, with between one and several actors in performance; the original production featured three actors. According to Kane's friend and fellow-playwright David Greig, the title of the play derives from the time, 4:48 a.m., when Kane, in her depressed state, often woke. Subject The play is usually interpreted as an expression of the experience of clinical depression, a disorder from which Kane suffered. She died by suicide after writing the play, before its initial performance. Rather than claiming that it tries to cover depression as a whole, it might be fairer on the text to say that it is a very subjective presentation of depression, giving the audience an insight into one particular case (or perhaps providing specifics on several individual cases), but while reflecting her mental state is explicitly detached from Kane herself. Contemplation and discussion of suicide are prominent and while there is no strict narrative or timeline, certain issues and events are clearly dealt with: deciding whether to take medication to treat depression, the desires of the depressed mind, the effects and effectiveness of medication, self-harm, suicide and the possible causes of depression. Other themes that run throughout the script, in addition to depression, are those of isolation, dependency, relationships, and love, but they become aggressive, then powerless. Form 4.48 Psychosis is composed of twenty-four sections which have no specified setting, characters or stage directions, only including lengths of silence. Its language varies between dialogues, confessions and contemplative poetic monologues reminiscent of schizophasia, an extension of the style which Kane had developed in Crave, where she had begun significantly to marry form and content. However, here, the obliteration of language is directly linked to depression and psychosis. Certain images are repeated within the script, particularly that of \\"hatch opens, stark light\\"; a repeated motif in the play is \\"serial sevens\\" which involves counting down from one hundred by sevens, a bedside test often used by psychiatrists to test for loss of concentration or memory. Around the end of the play, the text becomes increasingly sparse, implying that the speaker is less committing suicide and more disappearing from existence. Productions Owing to its form, productions of the play differ vastly in their staging, casting and design.

A critically acclaimed adaptation of the play, as translated into Polish with English language surtitles, was performed at the 2008 Edinburgh International Festival by the Polish theatre company TR Warszawa. The production starred Polish film actress Magdalena Cielecka and featured a number of other performers from TR Warszawa in supporting roles. This was a revival of TR Warszawa's earlier production of the play, as performed in Warsaw.The Scotsman , 16 August 2008 In 2003, there was a successful staging in Brazil, which played to a full house for six consecutive months in São Paulo, and also gained media attention for its defying gender aspect, as the role was performed by male actor Luiz Päetow. Indian director Arvind Gaur performed this play as a one-woman show with British actress Ruth Sheard in 2005. Reception 4.48 Psychosis divides opinion between critics and audiences and due to the subject matter of the play and Kane's subsequent suicide, some critics have had difficulty in distinguishing the play from the reality of Kane's life. Michael Billington of The Guardian newspaper asked, \\"How on earth do you award aesthetic points to a 75-minute suicide note?\\"The Guardian 30 June 2000 Charles Spencer of the Telegraph said \\"it is impossible not to view it as a deeply personal howl of pain\\"The Telegraph 14 May 2001 David Greig considered the play to be \\"perhaps uniquely painful in that it appears to have been written in the almost certain knowledge that it would be performed posthumously.\\"David Greig, introduction to Sarah Kane: Complete Plays 2001 Opera An operatic adaptation of 4.48 Psychosis, commissioned by Royal Opera and written by British composer Philip Venables, was staged at the Lyric Hammersmith in 2016. The first such adaptation of Kane's works, the production was approved by Sarah Kane's brother, and received critical acclaim.

He also made four etchings. Biography Easter Morning Born in Lübeck, his ancestors for three generations had been Protestant pastors; his father Christian Adolph Overbeck (1755–1821) was doctor of law, poet, mystic pietist and burgomaster of Lübeck. Within a stone's throw of the family mansion in the Konigstrasse stood the Gymnasium, where the uncle, doctor of theology and a voluminous writer, was the master; there the nephew became a classic scholar and received instruction in art. The young artist left Lübeck in March 1806, and entered as student the academy of Vienna, then under the direction of Heinrich Füger. While Overbeck clearly accrued some of the polished technical aspects of the neoclassic painters, he was alienated by lack of religious spirituality in the themes chosen by his masters. Overbeck wrote to a friend that he had fallen among a vulgar set, that every noble thought was suppressed within the academy and that losing all faith in humanity, he had turned inward to his faith for inspiration. In Overbeck's view, the nature of earlier European art had been corrupted throughout contemporary Europe, starting centuries before the French Revolution, and the process of discarding its Christian orientation was proceeding further now. He sought to express Christian art before the corrupting influence of the late Renaissance, casting aside his contemporary influences, and taking as a guide early Italian Renaissance painters, up to and including Raphael. Together with other disaffected young artists at the academy he started a group named the Guild of St Luke, dedicated to exploring his alternative vision for art. After four years, the differences between his group and others in the academy had grown so irreconcilable, that Overbeck and his followers were expelled. He left for Rome, where he arrived in 1810, carrying his half-finished canvas of Christ's Entry into Jerusalem. Rome became for 59 years the centre of his labor. He was joined by a company of like-minded artists, including Peter von Cornelius, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and Philipp Veit, who jointly housed in the old Franciscan convent of San Isidoro, and became known among friends and enemies by the descriptive epithet of Nazarenes. Their precept was hard and honest work and holy living; they eschewed the antique as pagan, the Renaissance as false, and built up a severe revival on simple nature and on the serious art of Perugino, Pinturicchio, Francesco Francia and the young Raphael. The characteristics of the style thus educed were nobility of idea, precision and even hardness of outline, scholastic composition, with the addition of light, shade and colour, not for allurement, but chiefly for perspicuity and completion of motive. Overbeck in 1813 joined the Roman Catholic Church, and thereby he believed that his art received Christian baptism. Italia und Germania (Albertinum). Timely commissions followed. The Prussian consul, Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, had a house on the brow of the Pincian Hill, called Palazzo Zuccari or Casa Bartholdy, and he engaged the quartet of Overbeck, Cornelius, Veit and Schadow to fresco a room 7 m square (now in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin) with episodes from the story of Joseph and his Brethren. The subjects which fell to the lot of Overbeck were the Seven Years of Famine and Joseph sold by his Brethren, finished in 1818. In the same year Prince Massimo commissioned Overbeck, Cornelius, Veit and Schnorr to cover the walls and ceilings of his garden pavilion, near St. John Lateran, with frescoes illustrative of Tasso, Dante and Ariosto. To Overbeck was assigned, in a room 5 m square, the illustration of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered; and of eleven compositions occupying one entire wall, is the Meeting of Godfrey de Bouillon and Peter the Hermit. After ten years delay, the overtaxed and enfeebled painter delegated the completion of the frescoes to his friend Joseph von Führich. The leisure thus gained was devoted to a thoroughly congenial theme, the Vision of St Francis, a wall-painting 6.5 m long, finished in 1830, for the Porziuncola in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli near Assisi. Overbeck was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864. He died in Rome in 1869. He was interred in the church of San Bernardo alle Terme.

John Ellis Troughton spent the first 20 years of the life of the church painting the interior with Overbeck murals, including the Palm Sunday one – of which the original was destroyed in an Allied Bombing raid in 1942, overnight into Palm Sunday.

He was born Henry Hugh Pearson and his middle name is sometimes given as Hugo.Nicholas Temperley, \\"Henry Pierson\\", in New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, London: Macmillan, 1980, vol. 14, p. 739. His original name was Henry Hugh Pearson, in Germany he used Heinrich Hugo Pierson.Collins Encyclopedia of Music, 1984, p.422, He had success in his adopted country with his operas and songs but little in his own, and his music is now rarely performed. Life Pierson was the son of a clergyman, Hugh Nicholas Pearson. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied counterpoint with Thomas Attwood Walmisley. From 1839 to 1844 he studies music in Germany; he also studied in Prague with Václav Tomášek. His amorous adventures included an apparent liaison with Mary Shelley, before he married in 1844. Although elected to a professorship at Edinburgh University he was made to resign when he did not take up his duties and subsequently based himself in Germany. Hubert Parry took lessons with him in 1867. Compositions (selective list) Many of Pierson's manuscript full and vocal scores, including those of his oratorios and operas, appear not to have survived. The funeral march Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet and The Maid of Orleans were his only orchestral compositions to be published in full score (copies of which are held by the Library of Congress amongst other locations), whilst Jerusalem and Faust were only published in vocal score, with no orchestral material seeming to be extant. His operas remained unpublished, excepting the libretti.
