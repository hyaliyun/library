Ardgowan is located in Inverclyde, in the former county of Renfrewshire. The Ardgowan estate has been held by the Stewart family since the early 15th century: towards the end of that century, their tower house Ardgowan Castle was built within the site of the previous Inverkip Castle fortress. The present house was erected in 1797 and completed in 1801 from designs by Cairncross. It is the seat of the Shaw Stewart baronets, currently Sir Ludovic Houston Shaw Stewart, 12th Baronet of Greenock and Blackhall. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History In 1403, King Robert III granted the lands of Ardgowan to his natural son, Sir John Stewart. In 1667 Archibald Stewart was created a baronet. The 3rd baronet married, in 1730, Helen Houston, heiress of the Shaws of Greenock. Their son Sir John Shaw-Stewart, 4th baronet, commissioned a design for a new house from the architect Hugh Cairncross. Construction began in 1797, and was completed around 1801. The grounds were laid out to designs by James Ramsay from 1800. In 1825 William Burn was appointed by the 6th baronet to extend the house. Sir Michael Shaw-Stewart, 7th Baronet and his wife Lady Octavia, daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Westminster, continued improvements to the grounds, employing their gardener brought from Eaton Hall, Cheshire to install formal gardens. In 1904 the 8th baronet commissioned Robert Lorimer to design the conservatory. Planting of new trees and shrubs continued until the Second World War, during which the house was employed as a hospital. The house remains home to the Shaw-Stewarts, and is also operated as a venue for rent. The 2018 adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Ordeal by Innocence was filmed in and around Ardgowan House in 2017. Several re-shoots took place in the same location in January and February 2018. Ardgowan House seen from the south-west, with the 15th century Ardgowan Castle to the right The estate The estate includes the remains of the 15th-century Ardgowan Castle, also known as Inverkip Castle. Only this tower house remains to mark the position of the old castle of Inverkip, which was a major fortress besieged by the forces of Edward I of England led by Earl of Ulster and his son-in-law Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick. The castle was then held by the English through the first part of what became known as the Scottish Wars of Independence. The three-story ruin is protected as a category B listed building. The gothic Chapel of St Michael and All Angels, built in the mid-19th century, is also on the estate, but since 2010 it has lost its roof and is falling into ruin.

The liquid colors are mixed into the plastic (raw polymer or recyclat) for coloring or changing the properties. In general, there are three groups of liquid colors. * Liquid colors, which are used to color plastic products. * Liquid additive concentrates that provide specific properties in the end products, such as UV stabilization, flame retardancy, antistatic or anti-blocking. * Combination liquid colors that contain both colorants and additives.  History and market relevance  So-called liquid colours have been used for colouring plastics since the end of the 1960s / beginning of the 1970s. However, liquid colours are still not used extensively and have a market share of just 7 % in Europe compared to 93 % for masterbatch colouring. This is different in the US, where the market share of liquid colors is about 40 %. This is mainly due to the inadequate dosing technology in the early days and the associated contamination in the production area. As a result, the liquid colorant gained a bad reputation and is still not very popular with processors, although the dosing systems have been adapted to the requirements of users, especially in the last decade, and clean and easy handling is possible.  Fields of application  It is possible to add liquid colors to a variety of thermoplastic and thermoset processing methods, such as * Film extrusion/ thermoforming sheets * Foam extrusion * Blown films * Profile extrusion * Injection mouldingFachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e.V. (Hrsg.): . M√§rz 2016 (www.biokunststoffe-verarbeiten.de). * Injection blow moulding * Sealing compounds * Plastisol hot dipping process The products obtained from the processing methods are used in the following areas, for example: * Packaging industry * Medical Technology * Automotive Industry * furniture industry * Electronics industry * Toy industry  Manufacture  Depending on the plastic, the choice of the liquid carrier is decisive due to the processing temperatures, compatibility and the later application. In order to prevent migration of the carrier liquid as far as possible, well-tolerated liquid carriers are used which interact with the polymer. The typical components are: * Fatty acid esters or fatty acid ester ethoxylates * Plasticisers * Paraffin, mineral and natural oils * Alkyd oils * Polyisobutylene * Polyhydric alcohols or alcohol ethoxylates * Lubricant * Antistatics Different mixtures of the components are also used. The pigment preparations are produced in batches. For this the formulation components are distributed into a binder previously selected for the respective application and then dispersed. The most optimal breaking up of agglomerates is crucial to ensure a high effectiveness of the colour concentrates and / or functional process additives. Dissolvers, bead mills and roller mills are usually used here. For transparent, thin film applications, particularly well broken down pigments are required. In practice, particle sizes < 5 Œºm have proven successful for film applications.  Dosing technology  Dosing of liquid color into the melt of an extruder by using a gear pump The liquid colours can be dosed in different ways. The simplest possibility is to use a so-called drum. Here the polymer granulate is wetted with the liquid color, homogenized in a mixing device and usually processed further. In large-scale applications, aggregates such as peristaltic pumps, Progressive Cavity Pumps or gear pumps are usually used. Here, the dosing can take place above the hopper or directly into the melt.  Advantages and Disadvantages  Positive effect of colour intensity and light scattering of liquid colour = Advantages = Due to batch production, the pigments can be broken down in the liquid carrier medium until they are optimally dispersed. The particles are therefore very finely distributed, which has a positive effect on color intensity and light scattering. Each batch can be controlled in terms of colour, viscosity and particle size distribution and, if necessary, corrected as a whole. If the liquid colorant is added to the main hopper together with the raw polymer, the distribution of the liquid colorant is statistically better than that of masterbatch even before melting. Without additional mixing units, a homogeneous, streak-free coloration can be achieved with highly concentrated liquid color from 0.5 % dosage. Due to the wetting with liquid carrier, the pigments adhere less strongly to the metal components of the processing machines, which results in sometimes significantly reduced color change times. Especially when using hot runner systems, the number of cleaning cycles can be reduced. In addition, it is possible to inject the liquid colorant downstream into the plastic melt with appropriate dosing technology. This means that only part of the production line has to be flushed when changing colors, which saves a considerable amount of material and time. The production of the liquid colours takes place at room temperature. A maximum of 40 ¬∞C is achieved by shearing. This means that heat-sensitive pigments such as fluorescent or daylight pigments are not thermally damaged. Defect patterns such as black specks and streaks are reduced and rejects are minimized. Liquid colors do not have to be pre-dried, which reduces energy costs and handling effort and also further reduces the thermal preload. The coloring of bio-based plastics with liquid colors leads to an increase in characteristic values in the notched bar impact test. = Disadvantages = The disadvantages are the high cleaning effort without using suitable dosing equipment. When dosing in the feed zone, very high colouring concentrations are not possible, since above a certain colour dosing level, overlubrication of the plasticizing screw can occur system- related. This means an excessive liquid film on the plasticizing screw, which hinders the uniform conveying of the polymer granulate. The maximum color dosage depends heavily on the polymer used (particle size, surface finish and surface energy), the machine configurations and the pigment load of the liquid color. This can cause problems with very thin-walled parts that must be colored as opaque as possible, or even prevent coloring with liquid color altogether. If the liquid colorants are not sufficiently stabilized, the colorants may settle. This can lead to uncontrolled flocculation, i.e. pigment particles are in direct contact with each other and can only be separated from each other by high shear forces. When suitable additives are used, pigment particles are connected to a network via additive molecules. Thus there is no direct pigment-pigment contact. Such flocculates can be destroyed by low shear forces, such as manual stirring.

Sayeret Matkal was called to the Heights on the second day of the war, taking part in the fighting as the elite reconnaissance unit of the 36th Division under Refael Eitan.

Avital has testified that it had been a tough battle; one which included close range gunfire and grenade launches, and was ultimately determined due to the confidence and personal example demonstrated by Netanyahu in battle. During the clash between the Matkal Unit and the Syrian commando, about forty Syrian fighters were killed and two Matkal fighters lost their lives. Avital also participated in the rescue operation in which the Matkal force, commanded by Netanyahu, rescued during the fighting, the wounded Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Yossi Ben Hanan from Tel - Shams. After which Avital and his men headed over to the southern front and participated in the fighting on the outskirts of Isma√Ølia and the takeover of the Jebel Ataka. In 1974 Avital participated in breaking into a residential unit in Beit Shean where three terrorists had barricaded themselves. All six Sayeret Matkal soldiers who participated in the break in, including Avital were awarded by the then Defense Minister, Shimon Peres, a book of poems by Natan Alterman in recognition of their courage. In 1975 Avital participated in pursuit of a squad of four terrorists who had infiltrated from Lebanon to the Metula region. Avital confronted the terrorists by himself and killed them in a brief battle. That same year Avital also completed a patrol course of The United States Army Rangers School. In 1976 he was positioned in Kenya, training the guard forces of Prime Minister, Jomo Kenyatta, and helped organize Operation Entebbe's rescue forces' landing in Nairobi. Upon his return Avital was appointed the Commander of Sayeret Matkal's Designated Company. However, several months later he was severely injured in a car accident which caused disability in his right hand. Avital went through a long rehabilitation period during which he dedicated his time to academic studies. In 1979 Avital returned to the Unit, filling a senior position. He participated in the takeover of the Infant day care during the Misgav Am hostage crisis in 1980. In March 1982 he was appointed Chief Commander of Sayeret Matkal. During his time as Chief Commander the Lebanon War broke out and Avital pushed to activate the unit as a regular infantry unit. During the war, Avital said, in a conference attended by the Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and the Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan, that he opposed the very idea of armored forces entry to Beirut, it being the capital of a neighboring country. Yet Avital said should it be decided to enter the city, he will lead his troops in the operation. A few days before Omer Bar Lev replaced him in the position, Avital participated in the rescue of the kidnapped hostages in line 300. After a year of study at the Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia, Avital joined the Armored Corps in 1986 and was appointed the Commander of the 74th Battalion of the 188th Brigade. Later he would command a reserves Brigade, and the Ephraim Territorial Brigade. Avital left to study in Boston in 1990 and upon his return he was appointed Commander of the 211th Armored Brigade, served as Deputy Commander of 36th Armored Division and was promoted to Brigadier General and Commander of the 98th Paratroopers Division. In 1994 Avital was appointed Commander of the 36th Armored Division, and later served as Chief of Staff of the Northern Command, and as the Northern Corpus Commander in the rank of Major General. In 2000 he was, by virtue of his experience in Special Forces, head of the Inquiry Commission regarding the Duvdevan Unit's friendly fire operational failure ‚Äì (when soldiers are hit by gunfire from the force to which they belong). The incident occurred while trying to arrest the engineer Mahmoud Abu Hunud, who was then named number 1 most wanted in the West Bank and belonged to Hamas' military wing Izz ad-Din al-Qassam. During the operation, which took place in the village Asira ash- Shamaliya, three of the unit's snipers mistakenly took their own team members who were lying on the roof in the area of operation to be terrorists and shot them dead. Following the operational failure it was decided to temporarily suspend the unit from operations and its Commander at the time - Mickey Edelstein resigned. At the beginning of the al-Aqsa Intifada, acting as the advisor on terrorism to the Chief of General Staff, Avital submitted a report on streamlining the civil and military operations against the Palestinians, in which he recommended to split the control of the West Bank fighting to another Division (A few months later the Judea Division was founded and took over for some of the routine security missions in the sector), and the increased cooperation between the IDF and the Shin Bet. Avital served as a staff commanding officer in the Northern Command overseeing the operations of the Egoz Unit, Unit 504 and the Lebanon Liaison Unit among others. He is disabled and therefore requires a specially modified attachment to his rifle's rotating bolt in order to load it. He survived at least one life-threatening car accident in the late 1990s while in IDF service. He is considered one of the brightest and talented officers in the IDF and in its history. In 2002, Avital retired from the IDF. Public life Towards the seventeenth Knesset elections, Avital was placed 39th in the Kadima list, and was not elected to the Knesset. On July 19, 2006, he was appointed Director General of the Ministry of the Environment and served in this capacity until that government's end of the term, in April 2009. Back to service In December 2011, the Chief of General Staff ordered the formation of the Depth Corps for joint operations in the strategic depth, and appointed Major General Avital as head of the corps. In September 2014, Avital retired from the IDF. Personal life Avital was born and raised in Moshav Arbel, and studied at the 'Kadoorie' agricultural school. Avital, a husband and father of four, lives to this day in Arbel. He holds a BA (cum laude) in Soil and Water sciences and in Agricultural Economics and Management from the Faculty of Agriculture of the Hebrew University, and has a degree (MPA) in Public Administration from the Kennedy School of Government in Harvard University where he studied as Member of the Wexner Israel Fellowship Program (Wexner Foundation). Notes # The testimony of Shay Avital in the movie 'Yoni Netanyahu - the real story': \\"He was my first senior commander, to me, a company commander that was not only the commander, he also was an educator. He worked us hard. When you had to be tough he was tough. He demanded a lot from us. He was not an easy commander, but at the same time, for example before going on a difficult journey of sometimes 80 kilometers, carrying a weight of 15-20 kilos on our backs, Yoni would go from soldier to soldier and ask each one how he was, and most of the time the men quietly returned back in line. I mean he persuaded them not with orders but by putting a good word. It is the eve of Chanukah, we are tired, and Yoni sits with the company the whole evening telling us about Judas Maccabeus. He talked about the history of the Jews two thousand years ago. He connected the story of their actions with ours today. He finished his lecture and we continued to run on the trails into the night, until two - three in the morning, and of course the next day we slept three hours and continued our training at six in the morning. \\" # Moshe Zonder, Sayeret Matkel, Keter Publishing House, 2000.

Alex serves as the protagonist of Final Destination. He is a senior student of Mt. Abraham High and one of the students aboard Vol√©e Airlines Flight 180. He is the sixth survivor of Flight 180 to die. Character arc =Background= Alex Browning was born on September 25, 1982, in the fictional town of Mt. Abraham, New York to Ken and Barbara Browning. He has been friends with siblings Tod and George Waggner since childhood and had been his classmates through high school since then. He is studying at Mt. Abraham High and is the rival of Carter Horton. He frequently fights with Carter whenever they're together and often can't control his actions. He is one of the students qualified to travel to Paris, France for the school's annual field trip. =Final Destination= In Final Destination, Alex and the senior class of Mt. Abraham High School board Vol√©e Airlines Flight 180, which is bound for departure from JFK International for Paris, France. While on board, Alex has an ominous vision of the plane exploding in mid-air. After warning everyone about it, he and some of his schoolmates are removed from the plane. While waiting at the airport, Alex witnesses the plane explode as he predicted. FBI Agent Schreck and Agent Weine interview the survivors afterwards and believe that Alex was responsible for blowing up Flight 180. While attending the memorial for the victims, Alex notices both agents carefully observing him and develops a relationship with Clear Rivers. Tod and Terry Chaney die afterwards and the Waggner household's anger towards Alex grows. With the help of Clear, Alex encounters William Bludworth, a mortician who knows more about Death than anyone else. Later that night, Alex realizes that Death is claiming back their lives which should have been lost on the plane, and is attacking them according to the order of their deaths on the plane. Alex and Clear attempt to save the remaining survivors, but fail in their attempts, with the exception of Carter. Knowing he is next to die, Alex suddenly realizes that he had exchanged seats in his original premonition, thus Clear will die before him. Finding Clear inside her car, trapped by live wires, Alex sacrifices himself by touching the wires to let her escape. It is revealed later on that Alex survived the electrocution. Now in Paris, the film ends with Carter saving Alex from a falling neon sign, but the sign swings back and kills Carter instead. However, in Final Destination 2, Clear reveals, to Kimberly Corman, that Alex died by being bludgeoned on the head by a dislodged brick from a nearby building. This was, however, not the original idea for this death; another version of the script had Alex, still killed off-screen, be killed by a ceiling fan.The original script, as seen here http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Final-Destination-2.html, had Alex be killed by a falling ceiling fan which impaled him in the head This death, however, was not his original planned death either for a third version of the script (the original script) had Alex be killed by a flesh eating virus.As seen here https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309593/trivia, Alex was supposed to be killed by a flesh eating virus in the original script He was briefly mentioned in Final Destination 3 and appeared in Final Destination 5, along with his class, being removed from Flight 180 and giving a warning that the aircraft would explode on takeoff, revealing that Final Destination 5 is a prequel of the first film. Alternate ending In the alternate ending of the film, Alex and Clear had made love on the beach before meeting Carter and Billy Hitchcock at their school, resulting in Clear's pregnancy. Later on, Alex dies after the live wire sets him on fire, incinerating him while attempting to save Clear. Nine months later, Clear gives birth to Alexander \\"Alex\\" Chance Browning and reunites with Carter, safe in the knowledge that they have finally defeated Death. Casting The role of Alex Browning was the challenging part for the writers, since they wanted Alex to show a variety of differing emotions throughout the film. The role of Alex, the last one cast, went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa, who previously starred in the 1999 film Idle Hands. Sawa commented that when \\"[he] read the script on a plane, it just freaked him out\\" and \\"[he] went down and met Glen and Jim and [he] thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas\\". However, writers Glen Morgan and James Wong were still not sure about casting him, so asked him to perform again and reviewed his previous work. Morgan was amazed by his performance in Idle Hands and Sawa was hired. Sawa described his role as \\"in the beginning, [Alex] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think he might have been a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes.\\" Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as \\"a very distinctive actor\\". \\"He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera; but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment.\\" Perry added. The character's surname was based by writer Jeffrey Reddick to American director Tod Browning, who directed both horror classics Dracula and Freaks. Besides Alex, Wong also chose the name of Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner, as a reference to the director's first name. Reception Sawa's performance earned him a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, and a nomination from Blockbuster Entertainment Awards for Favorite Actor in Horror (Internet Only). Moreover, Sawa's performance of Alex received generally positive reviews among critics. Stephen Holden of The New York Times commented that \\"The disaster and Alex's premonitions set up a heavy-handed fable about death and teenage illusions of invulnerability.\\", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News noted that \\"Sawa is solid as an Everyteen saddled with a rare and unwelcome gift\\". David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked \\"Sawa's personable turn as the hero is matched by a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with familiar faces (i.e. Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr, Tony Todd, etc)...\\"; while Joe Leydon of Variety pointed out that \\"Sawa is credible as the second-sighted Alex --- unlike many other actors cast a teen protagonists, he actually looks like he might still be attending high school --- but the supporting players are an uneven bunch.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Sawa and Ali Larter's pairing, observing that \\"Larter and Sawa, who becomes more scruffy and wild-eyed as the film progresses, make an appealing pair.\\" Dustin Putman of TheMovieBoy.com praised Sawa's performance, saying: > Devon Sawa, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in > 1999's underseen slasher-comedy, \\"Idle Hands,\\" is even more of a charismatic > presence here. The conflicting emotions he feels for his survival, which he > comes to believe he wasn't meant to do, as well as the loss of the other > passengers, is superbly and subtly acted on his part. One scene, in which he > is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is > especially realistic and powerful.

Background Kleyla had been himself an actor since 1991 when he performed in an equity production of Evita at Daytona Beach Community College. In 1995 he played the character Bobby Fricker in the film Now and Then, followed by his role as Josiah in Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering (1996), the young version of the character James Whale in Gods and Monsters (1998), and the character of Young Kevin in Free Enterprise (1998). In 2000 he partnered with his sister Alexis to form 'Red Dot Film Studios', and in 2005 his first project as writer and director was the comedy film The Road to Canyon Lake. Indyfans and the Quest for Fortune and Glory became Kleyla's second project as writer and director. =Production= Kleyla had been wanting to create a documentary about Indiana Jones fandom, and it was the announcement of the fourth film of the series that acted as his impetus. As a self-professed fan of the Indiana Jones films, director Kleyla made note that while there are fan conventions for Star Wars and Star Trek films, there are none for Indiana Jones films. In the summer of 2007, he began work to create a documentary about those he refers to as \\"the felt-hatted faithful\\". Stating that the film began \\"just for fun\\", Kleyla learned through his interview processes that the Indiana Jones films \\"have really gotten to people\\", just as he had himself become a fan of the films when as a child he repeatedly visited the Indiana Jones attraction at Disney World in Florida. The film's initial scenes were shot at New Haven, Connecticut where the director had hoped to catch the filming of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, following which production went to San Diego Comicon for additional fan interviews, then interviews with designers of the Indiana Jones attraction at Disney World, interviews with some peripheral members of the Jones production team: whip trainer Anthony DeLongis, costumer Deborah Nadoolman-Landis, and stunt doubles Vic Armstrong and Wendy Leech. The documentary concluded with a trip to Las Vegas to attend an auction of film props which included Indy's whip and the holy grail prop from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Critical response Film Threat made note of the film's interviews with fans and with industry professionals \\"marginally\\" associated with the Indiana Jones films or franchises, and wrote of the filmmaker's belief that the films made actual impact on people's lives. In panning the film, they wrote that they \\"threaten to be interesting on occasion, but the interviews do nothing to reinforce the filmmaker's thesis, because he doesn't have one.\\" Writing that the interviews seemed more haphazard than properly planned, they wrote that it seemed the director \\"just sort of rounded up people who like the films, and a few people who were marginally involved with the films, got them to speak a bit, and then edited the footage together without much of a direction to it\\". The reviewer placed the lack of the film's focus directly on \\"the director's choice of questions, his inability to draw the best anecdotes out of his interview subjects, and a lack of skill in the editing room.\\" USA Today spoke of how films and film franchises achieve \\"greatness\\". In using David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia as a yardstick, they noted that films can accomplish this through \\"deft directing, stellar acting and breathtaking scenery\\", or achieve it through the passion of fans toward certain films and their characters. They expanded that while films such as Star Wars and Star Trek series are famous for their fans, \\"Indy devotees politely and proudly separate themselves from folks who prefer films set in an era of intergalactic travel\\". Blogcritics make note that since filmmaker Brandon Kleyla since was born in 1983, he was too young to have seen the Indiana Jones trilogy original theatrical releases, but that after repetitively watching the Indiana Jones stunt show at Disney's MGM Studios, he \\"fell in love with the character\\", and began what is \\"reported to be one of the largest Indiana Jones memorabilia collections in the world\\". They expanded that the common theme about the persons being interviewed: \\"the love of Indiana Jones\\". They concluded by writing that the documentary \\"is a fun film that looks at how the Indiana Jones character and films have left their mark on pop culture and how Indy is one of the more recognizable icons of the 20th century.\\" Release The film premiered at the Newport Beach International Film Festival on April 27, 2008, and had its DVD release on October 7, 2008 through Cinema Libre Studio.

Biography  Hugh Plat was born in the spring of 1552, and baptised at St. James's, Garlickhythe, on 3 May 1552. He was third son, the eldest surviving son, of Richard Plat or Platt (1528-1600), a London brewer who ran the Old Swan brewery in James Street, London. His father owned property in St Pancras, London, bequeathed much of it to the foundation and endowment of a free school and six almshouses at Aldenham, Hertfordshire, and was buried at St. James's, Garlickhythe, on 28 November 1600. Hugh's mother, Alice, was daughter of John Birtles, of Birtles, Cheshire. Plat matriculated as a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 12 November 1568 and he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1572. Soon afterwards he became a member of Lincoln's Inn. He resided from 1594 at Bishop's Hall, Bethnal Green, later moving to the neighbouring Kirby's Castle. Both at Bethnal Green and in St Martin's Lane. he maintained gardens, where he conducted horticultural and agricultural experiments. For research, he often visited Sir Thomas Heneage's estate at Copt Hall, Essex, and other large properties. He learned metallurgy from blacksmiths, and worked with gardeners and farmers to gather information on horticulture and agriculture. In consideration of his services as inventor, Plat was knighted by James I at Greenwich on 22 May 1605. =Family and legacy= Plat married twice. His second wife, Judith, daughter of William Albany of London, was buried in Highgate Chapel, 28 January 1636. Plat left two sons and three daughters by his second marriage, and other children by his first. William, the fourth son of his second marriage, was buried in Highgate Chapel on 11 November 1637, beneath an elaborate tomb. He left land to St John's College, Cambridge, where he had been educated as a fellow-commoner. In 1858 William Platt's estate was merged in the general property of the college, and the three Platt fellowships, which then represented the endowment, became ordinary foundation fellowships. Work Throughout his lifetime, Plat published ten books based on his personal research and his studies of artisans. He also left behind a volume of handwritten notes that credited the people who helped him with his studies. =Early works, 1572-92= Amply provided for by his father, he devoted his early years to writing. In 1572 he made his first appearance in print as the author of 'The Floures of Philosophie, with Pleasures of Poetrie annexed to them, as wel pleasant to be read as profitable to be followed of al men,; dedicated to Anne Dudley, Countess of Warwick. 'The Floures of Philosophie' comprises 883 short sentences from Seneca; 'The Pleasures of Poetry' is a collection of miscellaneous poems. This work was followed by a similar undertaking, entitled 'Hvgonis Platti armig. Manuale sententias aliquot Diuinas et Morales complectens partim √® Sacris Patribus, partim √® Petrarcha philosopho et Poeta celeberrimo decerptas,' London, 1584; new edit. 1594. Plat developed an interest in natural science: mechanical inventions, domestic economy‚Äîand especially in agriculture, to which he devoted most of his later life. He corresponded with lovers of gardening and agriculture, and investigated the effects of various manures. In 1592 Plat exhibited to some privy councilors and chief citizens of London a series of mechanical inventions, and next year printed, as a broad-sheet, some account of them in 'A brief Apologie of certen new Inventions completed by H. Plat' (licensed to Richard Field in 1592). =The Jewell House of Art and Nature, 1594= The Jewell House of Art and Nature, title page 1653 The Jewell House of Art and Nature, 1653, p. 214 In 1594 there appeared 'The Jewell House of Art and Nature, conteining divers rare and profitable Inventions, together with sundry new Experiments in the Art of Husbandry, Distillation and Moulding. By Hugh Platte of Lincolnes Inn, Gent.,' London, 1594; dedicated to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. The volume consists of five tracts with separate title- pages, viz.: # 'Divers new Experiments;' # 'Diverse new Sorts of Soyle not yet brought into any Publique Use;' # 'Chimical Conclusions concerning the Art of Distillation;' # 'Of Moulding, Casting Metals;' # 'An offer of certain New Inventions which the Author proposes to Disclose upon reasonable Considerations.' The second of these tracts, which was also issued separately, contains notes by Plat on manures, and the last tract deals with miscellaneous topics, like the brewing of beers without hops, the preservation of food in hot weather and at sea, mnemonics, and fishing. Another edition appeared in 1613, and a revised edition, dedicated to Bulstrode Whitelocke, was prepared in 1653 by 'D. B.' (i.e. Arnold de Boate), who added 'A Discourse on Minerals, Stones, Gums, and Rosins.' = More works, 1595-1603 = In 1595 Plat gave further results in 'A Discoverie of certain English Wantes which are royally supplied in this Treatise. By H. Plat, of Lincolnes Inne, Esquire,' London 1595 (reprinted in the Harleian Miscellany, vol. ix.). In the same year he issued 'Sundrie New and Artificiall Remedies against Famine. Written by H. P., Esq., upon thoccasion of this present Dearth,' London; new edit. 1596; and his 'Newfounde Art of Setting of Corne' appeared about the same time without date. Other editions followed in 1600 and 1601. Plat collected recipes for preserving fruits, distilling, cooking, housewifery, cosmetics, and the dyeing of hair. Much of the information was already in his 'Jewell-house.' A more complete work was Delights for Ladies.Delights for Ladies to adorne their Persons, Tables, Closets, and Distillatories; with Bewties, Banquets, Perfumes, and Waters, London (by Peter Short), 1602; other editions, 1609, 1611, 1617, 1632, 1636, 1640, and 1656. The first part of the volume reappeared posthumously as 'A Closet for Ladies and Gentlemen, on the art of Preseruing, Conserving, and Candying. With the manner how to make diverse kinds of Syrupes: and all kinde of Banquetting Stuffes,' London, 1611. In 1603 Plat gave an account of an invention of cheap fuel‚Äîi.e. coal mixed with clay and other substances, and kneaded into balls‚Äîin a tract called 'Of Coal-Balls for Fewell wherein Seacoal is, by the mixture of other combustible Bodies, both sweetened and multiplied,' London, 1603. Richard Gosling reissued in 1628 an account of Plat's device, and developed it further in his 'Artificial Fire,' 1644. = Floraes Paradise, 1608 = His major work on gardening appeared in 1608, as 'Floraes Paradise beautified and adorned with sundry sortes of delicate Fruits and Flowers ... with an offer of an English Antidote ... a Remedy in violent Feavers and intermittent Agues.' The preface is dated from 'Bednal Green, 2 July 1608.' An appendix of 'new, rare, and profitable inventions' describes among other things, Plat's fireballs and his experiments in making wine from grapes grown at Bethnal Green. In his description of gardening experiments, Plat states the name of his informant in all cases where he had not done the work himself. He quotes repeatedly Mr. Andrew Hill, Mr. Pointer of Twickenham, 'Colborne,' and Parson Simson. 'Floraes Paradise' was reissued with some omissions and rearrangements by Charles Bellingham, who claimed relationship with Plat, in 1653, with a dedication to Francis Finch. It then bore the title 'The Garden of Eden; or an accurate Description of all Flowers and Fruits now growing in England. ... By that learned and great observer, Sir Hugh Plat, Knight,' London, 1653, called the fourth edition; another edition, 1659; 5th ed. 1660. Bellingham issued a second part drawn from Plat's unpublished notes in 1660, and both were issued together in 1675, in a so-called sixth edition. Another edition followed in the year 1685. Plat left unpublished notes and tracts on scientific topics. John Evelyn sent to Dr. Wotton in 1696 'A Short Treatise concerning Metals' by Plat.

Les was reintroduced as a regular character in April 2014 and continued to appear until 14 October 2016 when the character was axed from the show. Les first appears when he visits Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and David Wicks (Michael French) to arrange Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement) funeral. He tells them he used to know Pat when he was an apprentice, implying he was her client when she was a prostitute, and offers a discount on the funeral. He says that he arranged funerals for many of the other local residents, including David's father Pete Beale (Peter Dean), Pat's husband Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), Pat's former sister-in-law Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). He returns to meet Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) to finalise arrangements for the funeral of her daughter Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner). Jean is distressed to hear that Stacey is dead, but Mo Harris (Laila Morse) reveals she has just spoken to Stacey on the phone, meaning Stacey is alive. Les apologises profoundly before leaving. Les is seen by Sasha Dixon (Rebecca Sanneh) doing business with Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) and it turns out that when someone dies, Les offers to empty their house and sells the goods to Anthony for his business. Sasha and her employer, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), then ask Les to offer every other house to them for the charity shop. He attends a wake for a former Walford resident at The Queen Victoria public house, where Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) pretends to know the deceased, and talks to Les, successfully gaining Sasha a work experience placement with Les's firm. He attends the wake of a man previously known by Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) and is annoyed when Cora turns up, as he has agreements with her and Anthony. Les later appears when Sasha starts her first day of work experience. Les appears again to arrange Nick Cotton's (John Altman) funeral, although it is later revealed to be a scam in which Les is in on. Les moves his funeral business, Coker & Sons Funeral Parlour, to Turpin Road following the relocation of Pam's flower stall to Bridge Street Market. When walking home one night, Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) notices Les being handed money by Dot Branning's (June Brown) grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). Fatboy tries to tell Dot what Les and Charlie are up to, but is unsuccessful. In July, Les hires Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) at the undertakers, however he is disappointed when Billy doesn't turn up for work on his first day. Pam is upset when Les insults Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) while drunk, fearful it will reveal a big secret they have been keeping; that she euthanised their dying son, Lawrie. Billy eventually establishes a good working relationship with Les and a friendship as they spend Christmas together. Billy discovers the business is deeply in debt and forces Les to tell Pam this. They vow no more secrets, but after Les meets with his 'other woman', Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and gives her an expensive necklace. Claudette and Pam are revealed to be old friends, as Claudette is a foster mother and Pam used to help children in care. Les holidays in Gran Canaria with Claudette, although Pam sees it as a coincidence when she learns from Claudette's foster daughter Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) that they are both there at the same time. Les arranges a party for the centenary of Coker & Sons, and Pam gets upset at the thought that their grandson, Paul (Jonny Labey), will not attend. The same day, Paul returns but is cold towards Les. He reveals he is aware of his long running affair with Claudette and that was why he went to work abroad in the first place, not because of Pam's decision to euthanise his father as they previously believed. Paul threatens to expose the affair to Pam so Les tries to end things with Claudette, but Claudette tells Les that it will not be that easy. Claudette's son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) then becomes aware of the relationship between her and Les, and Paul tells Pam about it. Pam then finds Les's tie at Claudette's house, and when Les and Claudette give conflicting explanations, Pam leaves to stay with her sister. Les becomes very distraught at her departure, and Claudette urges him to tell Pam the truth, just as Pam returns and walks in on them together. Shortly after Claudette leaves the house, Pam urges Les to end the affair or their marriage is over. Two months later, Les visits Claudette for comfort after Pam refuses to speak to him on Lawrie's birthday. He later calls Claudette, telling her he cannot stop thinking about her, and makes an excuse to Pam to go and be with Claudette again. He is then caught in his underwear in Claudette's house by Donna, who concludes they are having an affair, and despite Les and Claudette denying it, Donna tells Pam what she saw. Pam then goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying gifts from Les until Claudette says the presents are not hers, and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam asks Les, he reveals that Christine is his secret feminine alter ego, where he dresses up in women's clothes and has done so since he was seven years old, but after they married he did not need Christine until Lawrie died, when the alter-ego became a grief outlet for him, and Claudette has been supporting this secret. Pam is horrified at him having lied to, and tells Les he disgusts her. However, Pam agrees to \\"meet\\" Christine. Les, as Christine, explains that this is how he can cope with things, as Christine is more open than Les, and he is still the same person. Pam apparently begins to accept this, but when Paul interrupts, Pam says she cannot accept it, so packs a bag and leaves, while Paul comforts Les. Paul manages to convince Pam to return home to talk to Les, but when she gets hesitant again, Les moves out to give Pam some time to think, and he moves in with Billy. Pam and Les have dinner together but she still cannot get the image of him dressed as Christine out of her mind, soLes burns all of Christine's clothes and photos and Pam agrees to take things one day at a time, but Babe Smith (Annette Badland) is watching and finds and pockets a surviving photo of Les dressed as Christine. Shortly after, Paul encourages Les to remind Pam of the man she first fell in love with and she agrees to his moving back in as long as they sleep in separate beds. A few months later, Les spurns Babe, so she sends Les an anonymous email, blackmailing him over his crossdressing. When Pam notices money has been paid from their account, Les admits he has been blackmailed. The blackmailing continues regularly, and Pam starts to suspect Babe, and eventually they discover the truth. Les confides in Claudette and says he misses Christine, so she gives him some of her clothes and makeup that she still has. Stressed, Les dresses up again but is caught by Paul. Paul refuses to destroy Christine's things for Les, saying Les should not suffer for who he is. When Pam finds Les dressed as Christine, she chastises him and he suffers a heart attack. Billy sees him as he enters the ambulance. Billy calls Les a \\"pervert\\" to Pam, so she fires him from the funeral parlour. Pam then tells Les they should retire away from London and Les agrees; when Paul and his boyfriend Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) find out, they decide they should take over the running of the funeral parlour. Paul's mother, Jenny Rawlinson, arrives looking for him, but he only assumes she is the blackmailer and orders her away. Pam and Les vow to tell Paul who she is, but Paul is killed in a homophobic attack. Pam struggles to cope, refusing to talk to Les about Paul, so he considers dressing as Christine; he explains why he cross-dresses to Billy and gives him his job back. Les then decides to be strong for Pam so tells Claudette he will no longer be Christine, but the blackmailing continues, with Pam refusing to go to the police, but she tells Claudette that Babe is the blackmailer. After four months of blackmail, Claudette reveals this to Babe's family, and Babe, who has just been attacked by Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) and come close to death, tells Claudette that she now sees how bad she has been and regrets everything, so it will stop. Les and Pam later attend a court hearing for Paul's killers. Les calls one of them, Simon Atmore (Tom Palmer), a liar after he denies having anything to do with Paul's death. When they arrive home, Pam tells him he needs to be Christine again. Les later suffers a small heart attack after talking to Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) who tries to comfort him and he eventually dresses up as Christine. Les then asks Pam if she would consider leaving Walford together for a fresh start after the trial is over which she agrees. Les and Pam are delighted when Babe returns all of their money. However, they decide to leave and Les appoints Billy as the manager of Coker and Sons. Pam packs a box of Christine's wig and clothes suggesting she has accepted her. After saying an emotional farewell to his friends and after giving Billy his funeral hat, Les departs with Pam for a new life in Worthing. = Development and reception = Having been originally introduced as the funeral director who arranged Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement) funeral, Sloman appeared in one episode on 9 January 2012 as a guest character.

Following this, Sloman was reintroduced as a regular cast member with Les' wife, Pam (Lin Blakley) being introduced also.

It's already so exciting to watch the chemistry between Roger and Lin on set, playing characters who have been together for so long, they know each other inside out. Or so they think.\\" Les and Pam arrived on 14 April 2014 when they relocated their funeral business to Turpin Road. Sloman and Blakley were axed by new executive producer Sean O'Connor in 2016, with a show insider commenting, \\"Pam and Les have been a big part of the show over the past few months and with their current storyline, bosses felt that it was the right time for their characters to leave the Square. There is still plenty more drama to come from the Cokers before they leave Walford.\\" TV columnist for The Sun, Ally Ross, called Sloman's initial cameo appearance in the show \\"TV gold\\". Of Pat and Les, Kate White of Inside Soap said \\"Pat had, erm, 'relations' with Mr Coker the undertaker. What a forward-thinking way to get a discount on your funeral.\\" The Daily Mirror's Jane Simon commented on Les's scenes, saying \\"You don't often get laughs out of an undertaker, but the chap who turns up to arrange Pat's funeral has Carol Jackson spluttering into her tea.\\" A reporter writing for the Inside Soap Yearbook described Pam and Les as a \\"soap favourite\\" and hoped they would \\"hurry home soon\\".

Jane has doubts about leaving Walford but later assures Gethin she wants to take the job, with him revealing his plans to set up a restaurant in Paris, with Jane as sous chef. Freegard auditioned for the part of Gethin but thought his audition did not go well because he found it \\"difficult without any sense of context to get the full grasp of what your character's all about.\\" He filmed his scenes over two days in November 2011.

Billy is also concerned when Lola returns with her friend Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), as he is on police bail for perverting the course of justice in relation to a murder. Trish comes back the next day with a list of concerns, and tells Lola she will be visiting more due to her bad attitude. Trish visits Lola again on several occasions, and sees paint on Lexi's feet, so tells Lola off as it could cause an allergic reaction, though it does not. Trish later worries when Lexi develops a cough. Trish finds out that Billy has lied about being employed, and then decides to visit daily as she feels he and Lola are not coping as she has used a tea towel as a nappy and the flat has not been cleaned. When Lola is arrested for assaulting Alexa Smith (Saffron Coomber), she is angry to see Trish arrive with the police. She bites Trish to stop her taking Lexi, but fails to stop her and is devastated when Trish takes Lexi from her.

Trish says that Lola is entitled to her access visits and can seek legal advice, however Lola agrees to let Phil go. When Phil returns, Trish informs him that she is pleased with Lola and she may get full custody of Lexi soon, leaving Phil unhappy. Trish attends a court hearing, stating Lola's positive progress and recommending that Lola has increased access to Lexi, but Phil has his solicitor tell the court that Lola turns up late and has a bad temper, so Lola's access does not change. Lola is angry and devastated, and Trish lends her support to Lola. After Phil and Lola sort their differences, Trish visits Phil and informs him that social services are preparing to increase Lola's visits to Lexi, with a view to returning Lexi to Lola in a couple of months.

Speaking of the storyline involving Trish, Harold told Inside Soap that when Trish arrives at Lola's house, \\"everything goes wrong at once\\", and explained that \\"Trish isn't given a good impression of Lola as a mother, and Lola isn't impressed when she sees her taking pages of notes\\". Lola is not happy about Trish getting involved in her life with daughter Lexi. All About Soap described Trish as the \\"bossy new social worker\\". = Reception = The scenes where Trish takes Lexi from Lola were criticised by the charity The Who Cares? Trust on Twitter, who called the storyline an \\"unhelpful portrayal\\" and said it had already received calls from members of the public who were \\"distressed about the EastEnders scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother's arms\\". The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC \\"too lazy and arrogant\\" to get correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken \\"without sufficient grounds to do so\\". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked \\"real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs\\". She stated: Another social worker said \\"Accurate procedures were not followed [when a character's baby was taken away]. Was it police protection, section 20? Where was the immediate risk to the baby? As a social worker, I was in tears, as was a colleague of mine, watching how our profession was portrayed on television.\\" The BBC responded to BASW by saying: A social worker who received the BBC's statement commented: In November 2012, Irish politician Robert Troy expressed concerns that the storyline could influence the result of an upcoming referendum on children's rights. Troy said, \\"Quite a few times I have been asked about a storyline on EastEnders where a young mother has had her child taken into care and has faced a very difficult battle to get access to the child. People have been emotionally affected by the story and have a real concern about the sort of heavy-handed state intervention that's portrayed.\\"  Danny Pennant  Danny Pennant, played by Gary Lucy, made his first screen appearance on 27 September 2012, appearing until 2 November. On 6 March 2013, it was announced that Lucy was returning to the cast. Danny appeared on 7 June 2013 before becoming a regular character in July.

Christian sees the messages so arranges to meet Danny, pretending to be Syed. Danny tells Christian that he and Syed in fact have had sex so Christian punches him. Syed finds Christian badly beaten, implying he and Danny had a violent fight. Danny tells police that Christian assaulted him, and Christian is arrested. Danny tells Syed he will withdraw his statement if Syed returns his ¬£500. However, Masood threatens to report Danny for fraud in regard to the failed investment and Christian is released without charge. In June 2013, Danny returns and attends the opening of Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) restaurant. Ian expects Danny, a friend of Mr Lister (Nick Wilton) to invest, but Danny reveals that he only helps people to invest and refuses to help Ian as Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), spills a drink on him. Danny then starts working for Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Later on, it is revealed that he is also attracted to women and kisses her. They have sex but Janine tells him that it is a one-off and she sees him as any other employee.

He initially decides not to tell Lucy but she discovers that Danny has been stealing from Janine and invites her to join him. Danny and Lucy lose their jobs when Janine sells the business so they plan to set up their own estate agents. They also plan to buy a flat together but Johnny tells Lucy about Danny's internet stalking and shows her Danny's profile on his mobile phone. Lucy is heartbroken by this revelation and confronts Danny with the information, asking him if he is only with her because she has Janine's money. Danny denies this and claims he loves her but Lucy does not believe him and throws the money out of her bedroom window into the street, where Johnny and other locals help themselves. Danny rushes outside and collects as much as he can and Lucy tells him to leave, threatening to call the police and report him for the embezzlement of Janine if he doesn't. Danny's last appearance sees him walking away with a handful of money. In April 2014, Danny builds his relationship back with Lucy leading to them having sex then they are caught by Shelley.

The actor has an initial contract of three months. Danny is a 28-year-old city banker, who has been described as being \\"mischievous\\", a \\"charmer\\" and someone who \\"oozes sex appeal\\". An EastEnders statement read \\"With his irresistible charm and luring persona, Danny is desired and envied by both men and women‚Äîgirls want to be seen with him and boys want to be him. He will inevitably create controversial encounters and his provocative and lustful nature is bound to land him in trouble\\". On 22 August, it was announced that Lucy would be playing a gay character, set to become involved in a love triangle with Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and Syed Masood (Marc Elliot). A source said, \\"All the girls think he's a real ladies' man. But they're soon disappointed when it turns out he's not interested in women. He'll ruffle a few feathers and Christian and Syed's relationship will be tested\\". A EastEnders spokesperson refused to confirm this saying, \\"It's fair to say that Danny is going to cause a few problems for the residents of Walford but viewers will have to tune in and see for themselves as we don't want to spoil the surprise!\\". When it was announced that Lucy was returning to the cast in 2013, executive producer Lorraine Newman said, \\"We are absolutely delighted to reveal that Gary Lucy will be returning to EastEnders. Gary clearly felt at home on the show and his wonderful portrayal of Danny Pennant left us with an intriguing character to explore. It really was only a matter of time before he returned. Danny's stories will see him crossing paths with some of our best-loved characters and I am sure the audience will relish the fact that the complex nature of this character means that nothing is ever simple.\\"  Alexa Smith  Alexa Smith, played by Saffron Coomber, is a former friend of Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold). She appears in four episodes from 1 to 5 October 2012, two episodes on 13 and 15 November 2012 and one on 7 March 2013. Alexa first appears when Lola sees her with a group of friends and recognises her from their time together in a care home. The next day, Lola meets Alexa and her friends, and Lola tries to impress them, keeping a look out while they shoplift. Later, they go to the local caf√© where Alexa starts throwing things at people, including Lola's friend Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald). Lola defends Abi, and Alexa says that she can only be friends with one of them, so Lola sides with Abi. Alexa is later shocked to discover Lola has a baby, and that Lola named her Lexi, after her. The next day, Lola sees Alexa and her gang, and Alexa insults Lexi, saying she should have had an abortion. When Abi arrives, Alexa mocks her for wearing makeup, wiping it from her face, and she and her friends start pushing and slapping Abi, filming everything on a mobile phone. They take Abi's phone, so Lola snatches it from Alexa. Alexa's friends grab Lola and when Alexa says that Lexi is dead, Lola breaks free and punches Alexa in the face, leaving her with a nosebleed. Alexa and her friends then show the police the part of their mobile phone video showing Lola attacking Alexa, and Lola is arrested, with Lexi being taken away by social services. About six weeks later, Alexa and her gang return and attempt to bully Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) until her friend Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn) chases the gang away. The next day, Alexa and her friends see Lola and her friend Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick) and taunt them about Lexi being in care. Lola tries to attack Alexa, but she is stopped by Jay and her grandfather Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Later, Billy sees Alexa alone and tells her he knows what it is like to be in care, as she does, and asks Alexa to give Lexi a chance to come home. Alexa is affected by Billy's words but when Lola arrives, she accuses Billy of witness tampering. However, Lexi's grandfather Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) learns from his lawyer that Alexa has dropped the assault charges against Lola. Three months later, Phil has custody of Lexi, but Lola snatches her after hearing Phil say she will never get Lexi back. Lola calls Alexa, having nobody else to turn to. Phil, Billy and Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) find Lola's phone and call Alexa, offering her money for information. They meet Alexa, who says Lola is in Tottenham, as she could not help Lola. Phil searches the squat that Alexa is staying in, but does not find Lola, though she is hiding in the house. She and Alexa talk, and Alexa says she ran away from her foster home. Alexa says Lola can stay the night while she parties with her friends, but Lola leaves when the police arrive. Harold explained to Katy White from Inside Soap that Lola and Alexa were best friends when they were in a care home together, but when Alexa was fostered, Lola felt abandoned. She said that \\"in [a care home] environment, friends mean more than family\\", and is now happy to see Alexa. White said that Alexa and her friends are \\"very wild\\", meaning that \\"getting caught up with them is the last thing Lola needs.\\" She explained that Lola's affection for her friend and her desire to fit in see her hanging out with them and putting up with their bad behaviour. Harold told All About Soap that while Lola has changed since they were in care, Alexa has not, and called the Alexa and her gang \\"scary\\", saying \\"They don't care about anyone but themselves [‚Ä¶]. It's nasty.\\" White described Alexa as \\"vicious\\" and \\"a very nasty piece of work.\\" Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly called her \\"a boisterous girl\\".  Lisa  Lisa, played by Marianne Benedict, appears on 1 October when Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) sets his brother Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) up on a date with her. She is much taller than Derek, which makes everybody else laugh. Inside Soap found the scenes funny, saying \\"Sometimes the simplest jokes are the best. We loved pint-sized Derek's supersize date! Tee-hee!\\" Heat called it the \\"Awkward date of the week\\", commenting that \\"[it] looks like Derek needs to take a leaf out of Tom Cruise's book and get himself some man-heels, what with his date towering over him like that. He looks pretty smug, she looks pretty miserable. Should have stuck with the other brother, love.\\"  Jackie Bosch  Jackie Bosch, played by Frances Lima, is a former girlfriend of Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). She appears on 13 November 2012, when Derek's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood) decides to take Derek to visit the love of his life to cheer him up. Derek knew Jackie when she was 16 and is the only woman he has ever loved but she broke his heart. However, Jackie remembers Derek as a bully who beat up David Wicks (Michael French), and says their few dates were not a big love affair as Derek calls it. Derek leaves after Jackie says she was not surprised when she heard Derek had been in prison. News of Jackie's appearance was first reported in October 2012, when photographs emerged from on-location filming, featuring actors Foreman and Jake Wood, who plays Derek's brother Max Branning, and two women, one of whom was Lima. At the time, no details of the characters were known. All About Soap and Inside Soap both speculated that they may have something to do with a secret Max is keeping from his fianc√©e Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner), but All About Soap noted that the house where filming took place was different from one seen in a previous episode where Max dropped off an envelope of cash, while Inside Soap said it was the same one. They also said that the women did not appear to be Max's usual type, but said Jackie (the older of the two women) did not seem happy to see them. When it emerged that Jackie was Derek's ex-girlfriend, and that Derek would be angry about the meeting and threaten to reveal Max's secret, Soaplife stated: \\"So [East]Enders specially casts Jackie, spends a packet on a location shoot so that Derek can get angry and mention the Max secret again? Hope the secret's better than this plot...\\"  Ava Hartman  Ava Hartman, played by Clare Perkins, is the daughter of Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) and half-sister of Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks). Ava first appears on 20 November 2012. It was announced in September 2013 that Ava would be leaving the series at the end of her storylines with Sam James (Cornell S John), as was originally planned. She departed on 17 December 2013. In July 2012, Cora tells Tanya that her daughter, Ava Anderton, was born in 1964 but was taken away by the staff while Cora was sleeping and they told her that Ava had died. In fact, Cora was forced to put Ava up for adoption. In November, Cora tells her partner Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) that Ava is alive and Patrick tells Tanya. Tanya tracks Ava down, and discovers she in the deputy headmistress of a local school. Tanya and Patrick visit the school, where Tanya is shocked to see Ava is mixed-race and tells her she is moving to the area. Ava gives them a tour of the school but Tanya runs out, leaving her purse behind. Tanya agrees to say nothing to Cora and not see Ava again and she and Patrick drive away before Ava can return the purse. Ava returns the purse the next day and Cora invites Ava in. Cora is shocked when Ava reveals her name. Ava learns the truth, and has a long talk with Cora, telling her she had thought about finding her before but decided the past was best left in the past, and nothing has changed, so leaves. A few weeks later, Cora visits Ava and gives her a bracelet that was given to Cora by Ava's father, along with a Christmas card. Ava later brings Cora a card in return, and wears the bracelet. Later, Tanya's daughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) befriends Dexter Hartman (Khali Best), and invites him to dinner with her family. Ava gatecrashes and berates Tanya for meddling. Tanya is clueless, and it is then revealed that Dexter is Ava's son. Ava is angry with Dexter for not speaking to her about what he was doing. Ava then gets a job at a school in Walford. Ava helps out when Bianca Butcher's (Patsy Palmer) son, Liam Butcher (James Forde), is involved with a gang that Dexter used to be a member of. They gang trash Ava and Dexter's home, and they move to Albert Square. Ava does not want to have anything to do with Cora, but Dexter urges her to, and she starts a friendship with Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), who has a romantic interest in her. Their date is interrupted by Ava's ex-husband and Dexter's father, Sam James (Cornell S John). Ava resents him because he claimed to have gone out to buy milk but did not return for 20 years, and both Ava and Dexter want Sam to leave. However, Ava slowly realises she still has romantic feelings for Sam and they have sex. The pair reunite and Dexter slowly warms to his father. It emerges that Sam requires a kidney transplant. Ava hopes to donate one of hers but is not a match. Dexter decides to take a test to see if he is a match, but Ava refuses to let him. He does so anyway, and he is a match, and Dexter and Sam go through the transplant operation. Ava fusses over both of them while they are recovering, and while Dexter is used to Ava's overprotective nature, Sam feels smothered. On Dexter's birthday, Ava discovers that Sam only came to Walford to get Dexter's kidney, leaving her furious. She throws him out, but keeps the reason for his departure secret from a devastated Dexter. Blaming her for Sam's sudden disappearance, Dexter moves in with Cora. Ava is offered a job in Newcastle, and Cora urges her to take it, but she turns it down. Dexter then discovers the truth about why Sam left. He emails the company offering the job, pretending to be Ava, and accepts the job on her behalf. She then agrees to go, but decides Dexter should stay in Walford because he has his own life now. Ava then thanks Cora, calling her \\"mum\\", and leaves. = Development = Since viewers discovered that Cora had a baby in the 1960s who she claimed was dead, speculation started about the fact that Ava could still be alive. Initial rumours suggested that Ava was actually Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean), who had recently returned to the series, despite Sharon's birth mother, Carol, having already appeared on screen in 1990. Perkins' casting as Ava was officially confirmed on 4 September 2012, when it was announced that viewers would discover that Ava was still alive. Perkins said of her casting, \\"I am delighted to be joining the show but to be working alongside Ann Mitchell makes it a dream come true. I have admired Ann's work for many years, and both she and Jo (Joyner) have been a real pleasure to work with. I'm now looking forward to see what the writers have in store for Ava\\". An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that finding out that Ava is alive would \\"be the most explosive moment of Cora's whole life\\", adding that it would be both \\"the most wonderful and yet the most terrible thing that could happen\\" because although Cora has her daughter back, she has not been able to get to know her until now. The insider said that Cora and Ava must both come to terms with this fact, and speculated that Ava may have been taken away from Cora by the nurses because her father was black and \\"racial prejudice [was] prevalent in the 1960s\\", calling it \\"an unimaginable cruelty to inflict on them both.\\" Mitchell revealed the reasons for Ava being taken away: \\"The baby's father was black and he left Cora before he knew she was pregnant. She was 18 and unmarried, and at that time, having a baby in her situation was a social stigma. She was made to feel enormous shame by her parents, who forced her to give the baby up for adoption.\\" She said Cora did not tell anyone, \\"partly through an enormous sense of guilt, and to keep things as safe and uncomplicated as they could be.\\" Of Ava's arrival, Mitchell said \\"It's going to be mayhem. The implications will be huge. The family will want answers, and I'm sure we won't be seeing the back of Ava.\\" Perkins' official credits list her as currently (September 2012) filming a regular role in EastEnders.  Tansy Meadow  Actress Daisy Wood-Davis was introduced for one episode as Tansy Meadow. Tansy Meadow, played by Daisy Wood-Davis, is the sister of Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright). She appeared on 22 November 2012. Poppy receives a phone call from Tansy to say she is visiting the next day, and Poppy is unhappy about it. Poppy tells her friends that Tansy is successful and has a fianc√©, and Poppy has lied to Tansy about her life. Poppy's friends Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) refuse to pretend to be her employees at the salon, calling Poppy their boss, when in fact Poppy is employed there. Poppy calls Tansy to try to put her off, but Tansy arrives while Poppy is on the phone to her. Tansy shows off her engagement ring, so Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) pretends to be Poppy's successful banker boyfriend until Mo Harris (Laila Morse) reveals that Fatboy is a barman. Poppy apologises to Tansy for lying, and then Lucy and Whitney turn up pretending to be Poppy's employees, with an emergency at the salon. Later, Tansy cries as Poppy has everything perfect, and reveals she split from her fianc√© three weeks ago because he cheated on her, and although she has worked out that Poppy does not own the salon, she thinks Poppy and Fatboy are good together. Poppy says they are just friends, but Tansy says that he clearly likes her a lot. Tansy's arrival for a single episode was announced when it was revealed that Poppy was to become a regular character. Wood-Davis filmed her scenes in late August and early September. Inside Soap said of Tansy: \\"Super-successful Tansy is always bragging about her wonderful life and fianc√©, so Poppy feels a bit of a failure in comparison.\\" Tansy also appears in a 15-minute spin-off episode, called \\"All I Want for Christmas\\".  Ayesha Rana  Ayesha Rana, played by Shivani Ghai, is a family friend of Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia). She makes her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 December 2012. She was written out in early 2013 and departed on 1 March 2013, after the departure of Zainab. Ayesha is first seen in the caf√©, where Zainab does not recognise her, and accuses her of pushing in the queue ahead of her. Later, Ayesha arrives at Zainab's home while Zainab is wearing a face mask. Zainab is annoyed that she was not ready for Ayesha's visit as she is three weeks early. Ayesha then overhears Zainab telling her son Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel) that he would be better for her than her suitor, Rashid Kayani (Gurpreet Singh). Zainab tries to get Ayesha and Tamwar together, and she thinks it has worked at her New Year's Eve party, but Tamwar is just looking after Ayesha because she is sick after AJ Ahmed (Phaldut Sharma) spiked the punch. Ayesha then meets Rashid, and thinks he is \\"alright\\". However, she soon develops a crush on Masood, which he discovers and does not tell Zainab. He urges her to try with Rashid and she does meet him again. She thinks Rashid is not right for her and it is clear she still wants Masood. She lies to Zainab that she is still seeing Rashid, while telling Masood she loves him. He rejects her advances, and she later confesses her love of Masood to Zainab, saying he feels the same, and then leaves Walford. After Masood and Zainab break up and Zainab moves to Pakistan, Ayesha returns for Masood. She ruins his date with Carol and the next day they kiss. Masood attempts to move away with Ayesha but in the end he rejects her and she leaves alone. Tamwar sees she is back and thinks she is the reason Zainab left. = Development = Ayesha's arrival was teased by executive producer Lorraine Newman in an interview with Digital Spy when she said, \\"The Masoods are rightfully incredibly popular and we've got big plans for them. [‚Ä¶] We also have a new female character joining the household in December. Let's just say that she's bound to cause a bit of mischief!\\" The character and casting were announced on 16 November, when Ayesha was described as \\"Sweet and studious, but rather shy\\", having lived a sheltered life. She is also described as a \\"na√Øve introvert\\". A BBC statement said of her storyline: \\"Since the tragic death of her beloved father, she has been left alone with a distant mother and uncaring brothers. Ayesha has agreed to fulfil her father's dying wish, going through with an arranged marriage. Can the Masoods help her? And will her time on [Albert] Square encourage this naive young woman to find her voice?\\" It was said that Ayesha would find living in Walford \\"a shock to the system, as she is used to grander surroundings.\\" Shivani said of her casting: \\"I've been watching EastEnders for years and am excited to be joining such an iconic show.\\" Details of Ayesha's arrival emerged on the day of her first episode, when it was revealed that Ayesha would be moving to Walford to get to know her suitor who lives in London, and that Ayesha would have a \\"shaky start\\" with Zainab, as she initially does not realise who Ayesha is.  Adam White  Adam White, played by Ben Wigzell is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend Carl White's (Daniel Coonan) brother. Adam first appears when he is in a group of men who give Carl's former prison cellmate Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) a beating after running his car off the road and chasing him. In February 2013, Kirsty's husband Max Branning (Jake Wood) goes to Adam's house to find Kirsty. Kirsty has a bruise on her neck, and realising Adam caused the injury, Max punches him. Adam and another man then beat Max after locking him inside the house. In May, Adam starts calling Kirsty, as Carl is due to be released from prison. Kirsty worries that they will track her down so Max returns with his brother Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) to confront Adam again. Adam punches Max so Jack throws him to the ground and the brothers order him to stop contacting Kirsty. In August 2013, Adam attacks Kirsty, asking her for money. Carl stops Adam, who did not know Carl would be there. Carl blames Adam for Kirsty marrying Max and their mother Nora White (Lynn Farleigh) being in a care home, and Adam explains he owes money to somebody. Carl and Adam go to nightclub R&R;, where Carl plans to sell drugs but they are confronted by Max and club owner Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Carl then disowns Adam and he leaves. Adam returns in March 2014, in search for Carl, who has since been murdered by Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), alongside his mother, Nora (Lynn Farleigh). Ronnie lies to both of them about her identity, claiming to be her sister Roxy (Rita Simons), who had been Carl's girlfriend, and says she does not know where he went. However, Adam knows she is lying as Carl had sent Adam a photo of himself and Roxy together. Adam later kidnaps Lexi Pearce, which displeases his mother. Phil and Ronnie track them down, demanding Lexi back. The Whites demand to know what happened to Carl in return for the baby. When the Mitchells are hesitant to provide an explanation, Adam loses his patience but Phil warns him off harming Lexi and takes Lexi off Adam. Nora begs them for answers and Ronnie breaks down and admits that she killed Carl, leaving a distraught Nora and Adam shocked. Ronnie and Phil return with Lexi, and give her back to her mother Lola (Danielle Harold) who is unaware of what has happened. Phil tells Ronnie she has to deal with Adam and Nora or he will. Ronnie then gets market inspector Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) to attack Adam and beat him up. Ronnie takes Phil to visit Adam in hospital after Aleks's assault on him whilst Nora sits beside his bedside. Ronnie warns both Nora and Adam off hassling the Mitchells further, threatening them with more violence. Ronnie and a disturbed Phil then leave. Adam and Nora have not been seen since. In Adam's first appearance, he is credited as \\"Thug\\", but his name was revealed in his second appearance. In August 2013, Heat said of Adam: \\"As if having bad boy Carl on the Square wasn't bad enough, now his brother Adam has popped up as well. And he's even more of a villain than Carl.\\" Adam returned on 10 March 2014 and departed on 17 March 2014.  Kirsty Branning  Kirsty Branning, played by Kierston Wareing, is the third wife of Max Branning (Jake Wood) and the secret that Max has withheld from his former wife and current fianc√©e Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner) for several months. Kirsty's storylines include faking a pregnancy to stop Max leaving her, suffering a panic attack when Max nearly discovers her deceit, and her ex-fianc√© Carl White (Daniel Coonan) trying to end her relationship with Max. In September 2013, it was announced that the character had been axed by new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, and Kirsty departed on 9 January 2014. = Storylines = Kirsty unexpectedly arrives at Max's home on Christmas Day after his brother Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) informs her of where he lives. Tanya answers the door and Kirsty introduces herself as Max's wife, moments before Max and Tanya are going to remarry. It is revealed that Max met Kirsty in 2011 after his split from Tanya, when he was living with Derek. Kirsty was working as an erotic dancer and was introduced to Max through Derek. They were both at a low ebb and Kirsty fell in love with Max, and they married. They planned to move to Manchester together but Max returned to Walford after hearing there was trouble there. Max learnt of Tanya's cancer and stood by her, and left Kirsty behind. Unknown to Max, Kirsty was pregnant with his child. Derek stayed in contact with Kirsty, and Max sent money so she could divorce him. Derek did not give Kirsty the last payment, but lied to Max that Kirsty had signed divorce papers. Derek told Kirsty that Max did not want the child and she terminated the pregnancy. After this is revealed, a huge argument ensues after which Derek suffers a massive heart attack and dies. Kirsty stays in Walford and gets a job at the local pub, The Queen Victoria. On the day of Derek's funeral, Max and Derek's sister Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) tells Kirsty that if she cannot find proof that Max loves her, then she must leave. When Kirsty meets Max, they argue but end up kissing passionately. Kirsty then attends the funeral, upsetting Tanya as Max has told her that Kirsty has left Walford. Tanya pays Kirsty to leave, but she does not go, so Tanya allows Kirsty to come to a family dinner to see what Max has with her. Kirsty revels in the fact that there are family problems. When Max's daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) is upset, Kirsty takes the opportunity to bond with her, upsetting Tanya. Kirsty gives Lauren the keys to her room at the B&B.; Max finds the keys and pockets them. Tanya finds them and assumes Max is still involved with Kirsty, so she goes to Kirsty's room and starts packing her belongings. Kirsty catches her, so Tanya tells Kirsty to leave, giving her the divorce papers to sign but Kirsty writes \\"never\\" on them. Lauren visits Kirsty and tells her to leave as Max will always want Tanya. Later, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) urges Kirsty to move on from Max, and as she realises how much she is hurting Max by staying, she signs the divorce papers. She tells Max she is leaving Walford. Tanya realises that Max still has feelings for Kirsty and ejects him from their home as Kirsty leaves Walford. Kirsty returns her wedding ring through the post. Max finds her staying with her ex-boyfriend Carl White's (Daniel Coonan) brother, Adam White (Ben Wigzell), who is abusive towards her. After Adam beats Max up, Kirsty and Max reconcile with a passionate kiss in Max's car. She returns to Walford and lives with Max in the B&B.; Kirsty is angry when Max continues to say he has a special connection with Tanya because they have children. Kirsty tells Max she is pregnant, and Max says he is not ready to have a child with her. They agree that she will have an abortion, but she confides in Kat that she is not really pregnant, and Max then asks Kirsty to not abort the pregnancy. Kirsty then hopes she will get pregnant, and announces to her neighbours in the pub that she is pregnant. Max then finds himself and Kirsty their own home. Kirsty worries when people ask questions about her pregnancy, and Kat urges her to tell Max the truth. Adam starts calling Kirsty, as Carl is due to be released from prison. She also starts worrying when they will track her down. Kirsty cancels an ultrasound scan appointment but lies to Max that the hospital cancelled it. Max takes her anyway and Kirsty suffers a panic attack, so she does not have a scan. Kirsty is stunned to see that Carl has arrived in Walford. She tells him she is married and pregnant, and that he should leave. However, Carl insists he will win Kirsty back. Eventually Kirsty thinks she may be pregnant, so takes a pregnancy test but bins it when Max arrives. They argue about Carl and the bin is knocked over, so Max finds the test. She admits that she was never pregnant, so Max returns to Tanya, as he was only with Kirsty because of the pregnancy. Tanya, however, refuses to take him back, and leaves Walford. Max moves into his old house. While Max is away from Walford, Kirsty and Carl visit Carl's mother, Nora White (Lynn Farleigh), because she does not know they have split up. On Max's return, Carl lets Max think he is now with Kirsty. Max tells Kirsty he could not stop thinking about her while he was away, so she suggests that they meet later, and if Max does not arrive then their relationship is over for good. Carl discovers this, so makes sure Max is busy at work and visits Kirsty at the time Max was meant to be there. The next day, Carl implies to Max that he and Kirsty had sex. Max tells people about this. She is angered by what both Max and Carl have done and rejects them both. When she confronts Max again, they passionately kiss, but are interrupted by Lauren, who has been in a rehabilitation clinic. Kirsty then puts the relationship on hold for Lauren's sake. However, Lauren convinces them to reunite, as Max is lovesick. Carl continues to interfere in Kirsty and Max's marriage, and when Max is arrested for cutting the brakes of Carl's car, he ends his relationship with Kirsty and says he is guilty. Kirsty does not believe him, and suspects Carl forced Max into this position. In desperation for money, Kirsty has sex with Carl, and then steals ¬£1000 from him. Max is then acquitted of the crime and reunites with Kirsty. However, Carl then tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison, and this leads to Max ending his relationship with her. In early 2014, Kirsty becomes concerned when Carl is nowhere to be seen, unaware that he has actually been murdered by Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). She asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton) about Carl's whereabouts, but nobody knows where he is. When Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) reveals to Max that Tanya is in a new relationship, he takes Kirsty back. The reunion is short, however, when Kirsty makes the mistake of cooking the meal with wine, knowing that Max's daughter Lauren is an alcoholic. Max throws the meal at the wall and Kirsty is thrown out of the house. The next day, Kirsty is homeless and Max gives her ¬£20 to live on, so she seeks advice from Shirley. At Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) engagement party, Kirsty acts drunk and tries to hug Max, stealing his car keys. Max, Lauren and many other locals step outside to find Kirsty in Max's car. She insults Max and throws away her wedding ring before leaving Walford. = Development = Wareing knew about the part of Kirsty in April 2012, and discovered she had the part in August at a meeting with executive producer Lorraine Newman and series consultant Simon Ashdown, who offered her the role. She started filming at the end of October, knowing her first episode would be on Christmas Day. She described her first scene as \\"really weird\\", \\"surreal\\" and \\"bizarre\\" because she had grown up watching EastEnders. The character was kept a secret, with no announcement being made, and the only people Wareing told she had the part were her father and brother. She found it more difficult over time to keep the secret, as for her, it was \\"exciting and nerve-wracking\\" and she wanted to share her news. She had to tell people who saw her arriving at BBC Elstree Studios that she was temping in the office or playing a background role. Wareing said in an interview released after her first episode was broadcast, that she loves playing Kirsty, saying \\"there are a lot of places she can go, I feel.\\" She said that Kirsty has \\"a lot of sides to her\\", meaning there are a lot of directions in which the character could be taken. She said that as not much is known about the character, \\"there is potential for a lot to come out about her.\\" At first she thought Kirsty was \\"a bitch\\", but felt that eventually people may need another side to her and sympathise with her. She added that Kirsty is \\"far from boring\\". An official statement said \\"Kirsty is set to cause trouble for Max and Tanya. Will Max and Tanya's relationship survive, and will Kirsty want to give up her husband? One thing's for sure, Kirsty is fiery, flirty and does what she wants.\\"  Others  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Character ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Actor ! scope=\\"col\\"  Circumstances - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   (2 episodes)   rowspan=\\"2\\"  Two brothers who meet Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and his sister Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) on a night out.

Quill is an American physician specialising in palliative care at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York. He is also a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center in Portland, Oregon. Quill was the lead plaintiff in a case that eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1997, Vacco v. Quill, in which the Court decided that a state law against physician-assisted suicide was constitutional. Quill earned his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1971, and his M.D. from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in 1976.\\"Timothy E. Quill, M.D.\\" (profile). University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. In 1991, Quill published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine describing how he assisted in the suicide of Patricia Diane Trumbull, a 45-year-old leukemia patient referred to in the article as \\"Diane\\". The report describes how Patricia, a long-time patient of Quill's with an extensive medical history including vaginal cancer, alcoholism and other issues was diagnosed with leukemia but refused chemotherapy. She shortly thereafter decided that she wanted to kill herself rather than have a \\"lingering death\\" which doctors had told her may be a matter of weeks or months away. Quill describes in the article how he referred her to the Hemlock Society and a week later she requested barbiturates to help with \\"insomnia\\". He gave her a prescription and told her the amount required to treat both insomnia and the dose required to bring about death. Some time after getting the prescription, she said her final goodbyes to Quill and her family and took the barbiturates alone. Patricia's husband reported the death to Quill who reported the cause of death as acute leukemia but left off mention of the suicide in reporting it to the medical examiner. When interviewed by the New York Times in 1991, Quill stated that he had not helped anyone else to die before or since. No charges or indictments were brought against Quill. The publication of this story has been considered to have \\"made history\\" and to have \\"stunned the medical community\\". Quill has subsequently been active in arguing for legalization of physician-assisted suicide, including during the controversial trials of Jack Kevorkian, and regarding the case of Terri Schiavo. Quill has argued against the principle of double effect in bioethics. In 2013, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine included Quill on a list of 'Hospice and Palliative Medicine Visionaries'.

In 1544 Duchal was acquired by John Porterfield, and in 1710 his descendant Alexander Porterfield constructed a new house. This building now forms the south range of the present house. Formal gardens had been laid out by around 1750. The house was extended eastward by Boyd Porterfield in 1768. In 1854 the estate was acquired by the Shaw-Stewarts of Ardgowan for use as a shooting lodge. Duchal was sold in 1910, and in 1915 was purchased by the shipowner Joseph Paton Maclay, 1st Baron Maclay, whose family occupied the house until 2018.

Early life After qualifying from Borgerdyd School in 1905, Gottlob attended the Technical School (1905-1908) and the Royal Academy, graduating as an architect in 1914. At the time, he was one of the young neoclassicists who used to meet at the Free Architecture Society (Den fri Architektforening). He taught at the Technical School (1915‚Äì17) and was an assistant at the Royal Academy's Building School (1917‚Äì24). Between 1912 and 1923, he travelled to Greece, London, North Africa, Italy, Paris and Vienna.\\"Kaj Gottlob\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 7 November 2011. After first working as an assistant at the Academy's School of Architecture in 1917, he was appointed professor in 1924. In 1936, he succeeded Kristoffer Varming as royal building inspector and, in 1938, gave up his post as professor at the Academy.http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Arkitekt/Kaj_Gottlob?highlight=kaj%20gottlob \\"Kaj Gottlob\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 7 November 2011. Career Knippelsbro, Copenhagen (1937) As a young man, Gottlob showed interest in classical architecture, influenced in part by the English Arts and Crafts movement. Works in the 1920s include a residence at 45 Dalgas Boulevard (1924) and St Luke's Church in √Örhus (1926). But like his peers, he soon turned to Nordic Neoclassicism, appreciating its sober, contemporary style. This can be seen in his Danish Student Hostel in Paris, completed in 1929. Though it was hardly international modernism, it was something of a breakthrough for Scandinavia. In designing √òrstedhus in 1934, Gottlob maintained some of the classical ideals, especially with the symmetry and hierarchical form of the facade. Standing on the corner of Gyldenl√∏vsgade and Vester Farimagsgade in Copenhagen, the building was constructed by the cement firm Christiani & Nielsen. It is therefore not surprising that it was made of concrete and that, unusually for an office building, the facade remained uncovered. The windows were mounted in finely shaped frames and the pillars at the main entrance were lined with stainless steel. Gottlob's designs for a series of Copenhagen schools represented a break with classicism. In Katrinedal School (1935), the large central hall or aula served as an example for many Danish schools in subsequent years. Svagb√∏rnsskole (1937), constructed in conjunction with Skolen ved Sundet, has south-facing fully glazed windows, opening onto the school yard. Both schools have aulas, symbolising modernism's concern for light, air, health and nature.\\"Ny - klassicist og Modernist\\", Genbyg.dk. Retrieved 7 November 2011. Gottlob's largest project was for the university buildings at N√∏rref√¶lled. The additions, which include the school of dentistry and the zoological museum, were completed in stages in the 1940s and the 1950s. The area was conceived as an open park development where the trees played an important role. Gottlob's relatively low buildings, clad in light travertine, respected the approach but later additions led to crowding. As the architect responsible for the renewal of the two old bridges over Copenhagen's harbour, he demonstrated his ability to combine attractive design with components created by engineers. Knippelsbro and Langebro, which play such an important part in the city, are among the finest examples of 1930s modernism in Denmark. Furniture Other meaningful contributions by Gottlob in the 1930s were the furniture and fittings for the houses he designed. He also designed furniture for the Danish pavilion at the 1925 World Exhibition in Paris which was successfully exhibited by the cabinetmaker A. J. Iversen with whom he worked for a number of years.Andrew Hollingsworth, Danish Modern, Gibbs Smith, p. 1 His furniture in an increasingly modern style could often be seen in the exhibitions at the Design Museum. An early example of his furniture is the Klismos Chair (1922), produced by Fritz Hansen in ash.

Catherine lived at Papplewick until 1822 but did not marry. On her death the Estate went to Richard Fountayne Wilson of Melton-on-the-Hill. He gave it by Royal Licence to his 10-year-old son, Andrew, in 1826. Andrew Montagu took charge of the estate during 1840 and moved into Papplewick Hall from his home at Normanton, Rutland. He never married and on his death in 1895, the Papplewick Estate was left in trust, for his brother's youngest son, James Fountayne Montagu. James inherited the Estate on his 25th birthday in December 1912, and he developed it as a horse breeding centre. However, the First World War intervened. After the war he ran up large debts. In April 1919, Alderman Albert Ball emerged as the purchaser of the Papplewick Estate for the hitherto undisclosed sum of ¬£136,410 (). Subsequent sales divided the estate between the Hucknall Torkard Industrial Provident Society which purchased 1,058 acres in Papplewick and Linby, whilst Sir Charles Seely, 2nd Baronet took another 444 acres centred on Forest Farm. Today the house and grounds are privately owned.

In a racing career that lasted from 1960 to 1961 Psidium ran eleven times and won twice. He is best known for his win, as a 66/1 outsider in the 1961 Epsom Derby. He later became a successful stallion. Background Psidium, a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze, standing 16.1 hands high,http://www.pedigreequery.com/psidium was bred in Ireland by his owner Etti Plesch. His sire Pardal was a high class racehorse who won the Jockey Club Stakes and the Princess of Wales's Stakes. Psidium's dam, the Italian mare Dinarella finished fourth in the Oaks d'Italia and also produced the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Thymus. Mme Plesch named all her horses after flowers with Psidium being named after the Guava Flower Psidium was sent into training with Harry Wragg at his Abington Place stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1960: two-year-old season= Psidium ran seven times as a two-year-old in 1960. He won the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes at Kempton and finished third in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket and the Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury. In the Free Handicap, an assessment of the year's best two-year-olds, Psidium was given a rating of 116lbs, seventeen pounds below the top weight Opaline. =1961: three-year-old season= On his three-year- old debut, Psidium finished third in the 2000 Guineas Trial at Kempton. He then ran finished eighteenth of the twenty-two runners behind Rockavon in the 2000 Guineas. On his next start he was sent to France for the Prix Daru over 2100m in which he finished fourth behind Moutiers. He was ridden in the race by Lester Piggott who expressed his view that Psidium did not stay the distance. At Epsom, Psidium was ridden by the French jockey Roger Poincelet. He was not considered a serious contender, starting at odds of 66/1 in a field of twenty-eight. The race was run on rock-hard ground in front of a crowd estimated at 250,000 which included the Queen and the Queen Mother. Psidium was held up towards the back of the field, and was not in contention when the leaders turned into the straight. In the final quarter of a mile, Poincelet moved Psidium to the wide outside and the colt produced a sudden burst of acceleration to move past the field. He overtook Dicta Drake inside the final furlong and won going away by two lengths, with Poincelet easing down. Mme Plesch was reportedly astonished by her colt's performance saying that she \\"never expected he would finish in the first ten.\\" Shortly after his victory, Psidium was injured in training and never ran again. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Psidium a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù Derby winner. Timeform awarded Psidium a rating of 130, which is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner. Stud career Psidium stood as a stallion at the Cheveley Park Stud at Newmarket. He was the leading British sire (in winning prize money) in 1966, thanks to the achievements of his son Sodium who won the Irish Derby and the St Leger. Psidium was exported to Argentina in 1970.

Some forces are performed physically using sleight of hand, such as a trick where a spectator appears to select a random card from a deck but is instead handed a known card by the magician. Other forces use equivocation (or \\"the magician's choice\\") to create the illusion of a free decision in a situation where all choices lead to the same outcome. Equivocation Equivocation (or the magician's choice) is a verbal technique by which a magician gives an audience member an apparently free choice, but frames the next stage of the trick in such a way that each choice has the same end result. An example of equivocation can be as follows: A performer deals two cards on a table and ask a spectator to select one. If the spectator chooses the card on the left, the performer will hand the card to the spectator. If they pick the card on the right, the performer will take that card as his own and have the other card be the spectator's. In either case, the spectator receives the intended card. Effectiveness The effectiveness of equivocation involves the \\"information gap\\" between what the spectator knows and what the spectator thinks they know. In the magician's force, the spectator does not know anything about what will happen to the two cards he initially selects. However, the spectator thinks that they are making a free choice in an otherwise scripted sequence of moves. Equivocation tends to lose its effectiveness if repeated in the same context, since the spectator gains more information from one performance to the next, thereby shrinking the information gap. For example, a spectator may wonder why their choice was kept in some cases and discarded in others.

The technology incorporates a software-defined radio device, and is designed with a consolidated set of hardware components, allowing operators to purchase, operate and maintain a single telecommunications network and set of equipment, while supporting multiple mobile communications standards. Development and deployment Huawei began to develop its SingleRAN technology in order to address network operators' demand for improved cost efficiency in managing telecommunications network sites, spectrum, pipeline and staff. In 2008, the company introduced the industry's first commercial SingleRAN product, which allowed mobile operators to switch from GSM to UMTS network standards or use both simultaneously. That year Huawei also launched a commercial network based on SingleRAN that offered simultaneous CDMA and LTE modes. =Early deployment= In May 2009, Am√©rica M√≥vil, the largest mobile operator in Latin America, deployed Huawei's SingleRAN GSM and UMTS system in Panama, providing its customers with voice and data services from GSM and UMTS networks simultaneously. According to The Economist, Am√©rica M√≥vil found that the power consumption of its base stations was reduced by 50% and the volume of equipment it needed was reduced by 70%, following deployment of Huawei's SingleRAN hardware. In June 2009, Huawei's SingleRAN technology was selected by TeliaSonera for Europe's first GSM/UMTS network with software-defined radio (SDR) technology. TeliaSonera used Huawei SingleRAN to provide its subscribers in Finland with both GSM and UMTS services using the same 900MHz spectrum. Later that year, in December 2009, TeliaSonera also used Huawei's SingleRAN LTE technology to launch the world's first LTE commercial network in Norway. That same month, Net4Mobility selected Huawei SingleRAN GSM system to deploy their GSM/LTE 900 MHz SDR network in Sweden. =Recent developments= In March 2010, Huawei achieved what it stated is a world-record 1.2Gbit/s download speed on a demo network built around Huawei's prototype SingleRAN LTE-Advanced device. In November that year, the company released a new SingleRAN technology, enabling operators to migrate between WiMAX and LTE TDD networks. That same month, Aero2 selected Huawei's SingleRAN technology to deploy the world's first GSM and LTE 1800MHz SDR network in Poland, which was due to become operational in early 2011. In the first half of 2011, Huawei launched a SingleRAN system that supported both WiMAX and LTE. To date, Huawei has deployed over 130 SingleRAN networks worldwide for global network operators including Telef√≥nica, O2 Germany, China Unicom, America Movil, Telenor, Net4Mobility and TeliaSonera. Products Huawei has developed and provides four SingleRAN products for mobile network operators. According to Huawei, SingleRAN GSM is designed for mobile operators using GSM networks, allowing them to simultaneously offer GSM with UMTS or LTE. The product also aims to prepare operators for future evolution of technology, including moving to mobile broadband networks. Huawei's SingleRAN LTE allows mobile service operators to migrate to LTE networks, and also continue to offer GSM, EDGE, UMTS or HSPA. The technology provides download speeds of up to 100Mbit/s. The SingleRAN@Broad system was launched by Huawei at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2010. This product helps operators to accommodate large increases in mobile broadband traffic and reduce the per-bit costs of network operation. According to Huawei, SingleRAN@Broad is capable of increasing operators‚Äô mobile broadband capacity to handle high traffic generated by smartphones and similar devices. In November 2010, Huawei released SingleRAN WiMAX/LTE TDD, which allows operators to migrate from WiMAX to LTE TDD networks by configuring the technology as either a WiMAX module, a LTE TDD module, or a dual-mode module. In addition to the SingleRAN products for mobile telecommunications operators, Huawei also offers a SingleRAN product aimed at railway transport systems. SingleRAN GSM-R is a suite of communications technologies that are designed to improve telecommunications performance through long tunnels, over very long distances, and in high- traffic areas. Huawei began researching GSM-R technologies in 2001 and, according to Cellular News, is \\"one of only a few\\" GSM-R network providers in the world. Awards In September 2009, Huawei's SingleRAN Dual-Mode Remote Radio Unit 3808 won an InfoVision award in the category of ‚ÄúNew Product Concepts‚Äù from the International Engineering Consortium (IEC) at the Broadband World Forum in Paris. The following year, at the Broadband World Forum in October 2010, Huawei's SingleRAN@Broad technology was awarded the 2010 InfoVision Award in the category of ‚ÄúBroadband Access Network Technologies and Services‚Äù. In May 2011, Huawei's SingleRAN 5-Band 3-Mode 1-Cabinet technology (BTS 3900L) won the ‚ÄúBest LTE Network Elements‚Äù award at the LTE World Summit.

The drama is written and directed by Charles Sturridge and stars Matthew Rhys as lookalike characters John Standing and Johnny Spence. It was broadcast on ITV on 9 September 2012. The novel was first adapted into film in 1959 by director Robert Hamer, with Sir Alec Guinness playing the parts of John Barratt and Jacques de Gu√©. Plot There are significant differences between this adaptation and the original novel. Whereas the action of the novel takes place in France, this screen version is set in the UK in 1952 as Britain prepares for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Teacher John Standing, who has just lost his job, meets his doppelg√§nger Johnny Spence, a failed businessman, in a hotel. Standing is encouraged by Spence to get drunk and the next morning wakes without his clothes and wallet and with Spence gone. Collected by George, the chauffeur to the Spence family, he has difficulty explaining himself and is taken to the family's grand home. He is quickly drawn into family and business affairs and is forced to deal with Spence's business problems and the women in his life: his wife, mother, sister, young daughter, and two mistresses (Spence's sister-in-law Nina, and Bela, a French artist who lives in the nearby town). The family glass business is failing, and Standing staves off the inevitable by pretending to have signed a contract with a major customer. He finds that Spence's younger brother, Paul, is capable but lacking in confidence, whilst his sister, Blanche, hates Johnny, whom she blames for the suicide of her close friend. Standing discovers that the only money available to save the business is a trust fund belonging to Spence's neglected wife, Frances, but the trust pays out only if Frances has a male heir or she predeceases her husband. Spence, curious as to what is going on in his absence, returns to the house to retrieve his gun and sees Standing sleeping with Frances. Astonished, he uses their (John and Frances') improved relationship to his advantage. While Standing is out at a shooting party lunch with the rest of the family, Spence manipulates Frances into taking an overdose of morphine so that he can claim the trust fund and save the glass business. She willingly submits, sacrificing herself to save her family. Her daughter, \\"Piglet,\\" sees them together and confronts Standing, still mistaking him for her father. Standing rushes to the house to find Frances barely alive; he revives her with help from Charlotte, Spence's mother's caretaker. Standing confronts Spence at the glass foundry. Spence offers him a share of the money, but Standing refuses, so Spence forces him at gunpoint to exchange clothing, planning to kill him and dispose of his body in the foundry. A struggle ensues, and Spence is killed. Standing returns to the house, intending to disappear, but is dissuaded by Charlotte, who has seen through him. In the final scene, Standing is seen with the Spence family, including a pregnant Frances, watching the Coronation on a newly acquired television set. This ending differs completely from the novel.

West Coast appeared twice in recorded cricket. The first match was a first-class match against Wellington in 1879 at the Basin Reserve. Captained by George Anson, the team won its only appearance in first-class cricket by 6 wickets. In the low-scoring match, William Barton scored 75 not out in West Coast's first innings; the next-highest score in the match was 26. The team's second appearance came in a one-day match against Wellington in 1882. The New Zealand captain and cricket historian Dan Reese later wrote: \\"For a couple of years ... Wanganui cricket reached first-class standard, chiefly on account of Barton, then the best batsman in New Zealand, being resident there. But neither before nor since have they been first-class.\\" A West Coast Cricket Association was formed in 1888, based in Wanganui and including Hawera and Feilding. It lapsed in the 1890s, and never fielded a representative team.

The complex is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. It is where Josie Bassett Morris, a small-time rancher and occasional accused stock thief, lived until 1963. The ranch, located in Browns Park, Colorado, was established by the Bassett family in the 1870s. Josie grew up there, and through her family came to know a number of outlaws, including Butch Cassidy, who frequented the area. Morris established her own homestead on Cub Creek in Utah in 1914 with help from friends Fred McKnight and the Chew family. Josie Bassett Morris The Bassett family moved west from Arkansas around 1877 to establish a homestead in the west, taking their three-year-old daughter Josie. Comparatively wealthy and educated for homesteaders, they established a ranch in the Brown's Park region near the Colorado-Wyoming border. Josie married Jim McKnight at the age of 19 in 1893. In 1914 Josie and husband M.B. (Ben) Morris, without much money, established a homestead claim at Cub Creek near Split Mountain, 40 miles from the family ranch. Her son Crawford and his wife lived there for a time, and grandchildren visited. Morris was a colorful local character, married five times and divorcing four of her husbands, and living in the cabin for over fifty years until she fell on ice and broke her hip in 1963. She died the following year at the age of 90. She was tried and acquitted for cattle rustling in her 60s and made brandy and wine from local fruit and berries during Prohibition. Ranch The ranch house started as a low square log cabin, with a kitchen added later. The house is surrounded by dependent structures, such as a chicken house, outhouse, root cellar, sheds and a small barn. A bridge provided access to the root cellar, located across the creek. The Morris ranch complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1986. The National Park Service maintains an interpretive display at the site.

Malek Jehan Khanum was a Persian princess of the Qajar dynasty by both birth and marriage. By birth, being the daughter of Amir Mohammad Qassem Khan Qajar Qovanlou 'Amir Kabir' and Princess Begom Jan Khanoum Qajar, she was the granddaughter of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar of Persia. Her paternal grandfather was the powerful Qajar commander Amir Soleyman Khan Qajar Qovanlou 'Amir Kabir' 'Nezam od-Doleh' 'Etezad od-Doleh' and her paternal grandmother was a princess of the Zand dynasty.L.A. Ferydoun Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn, \\"Genealogy of the Qajar Qovanlou Family: a First Draft,\\" in: Qajar Studies X-XI, Journal of the International Qajar Studies Association, Rotterdam/Santa Barbara/Tehran 2011, pp. 197-259. She was married at a young age to her cousin, Mohammad Shah Qajar of Persia (reign 1834-1848). Her husband married about fifteen women during his lifetime, but she was one of his earliest wives. She held prestige within the harem for several reasons: because of her seniority among the Shah's wives; because she was a member of the family by birth and therefore well-networked and well-versed in their ways; because she bore her husband as many as five children (two of whom reached adulthood) and most of all because she was the mother of the crown prince. Her only surviving son, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, would succeed his father to the throne of Persia. Her title Mehd-i-aulia or Mehd-e-olia means \\"Sublime Cradle\\" and this title was generally bestowed on the mother of the heir apparent. As empress dowager, she was the regent of Persian Empire for one month, from 5 September until 5 October in 1848, between the death of her husband and the accession to the throne of her son. As queen mother, she exerted considerable political influence during the reign of her son from 1848 until her death in 1873. She is described as a strong personality and politically gifted. Strongly rooted in family and clan networks, she tended to favour and support the Qajar nobility rather than merited commoners, mostly because members of the Qajar family and clan had much better access to her as compared to outsiders.

The church was originally to be used solely to provide more storage space for Acoustic Sounds, Inc., an international LP record and CD mail-order business founded by Kassem in 1986. The church was designed by Salina architect Charles W. Shaver and was built starting in 1924 and completed in 1927. The church features 50 stained glass windows, walnut beams, a 42-foot-high vaulted ceiling and oak woodwork trim and pews. Recognizing the structure's inherent superior acoustics, Kassem decided to use the church sanctuary as a recording area and build at the rear of the space a modern engineering control room with direct to disc recording and LP lathe cutting capabilities.John Atkinson, \\"Two Days in August: Stereophile's First Jazz Recording Blue Heaven Studios\\", \\"Blue Heaven Studios\\" Repairs and interior design Work on the building ranged from repairing leaks in the roof to replacing faulty wiring to heater maintenance. Nearly two tons of dry plaster was used in making wall repairs. Design expert Neil Muncy, specializing in the design of broadcast and recording facilities, was hired to oversee the recording studio project. The studio was wired with premium audio cable from Belden and Canare with gold- plated connectors. New electrical service, including panels, breakers and surge suppression was installed, as well as a new transformer to provide the studio with its own power source. The sanctuary is wired for 200 amps of stage lighting, eight camera lines, press feed and video distribution throughout the building.

It has Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade I listed building protection. A three-storey tower was built by Sir William Claxton on the site of an earlier pele tower in the 15th century. The Radclyffe family In 1621 the castle was acquired by the Radclyffe family as a result of the marriage of Edward Radclyffe to the Dilston heiress. The Catholic Radclyffes built a private chapel adjacent to the house in 1616 ( the chapel also has Ancient Monument and Listed Building status). In 1622 Sir Francis Radclyffe incorporated the tower house into a new manor house, which was to become known as Dilston Hall. A later Francis Radclyffe was a supporter of the Royalist cause during the Civil War and his estates including Dilston Hall were sequestrated by the Commonwealth. The property was reverted to the family at the Restoration. The 3rd Earl began in 1709 an ambitious programme to replace the old house with a substantial mansion. The new mansion was never completed. The 3rd Earl James Radclyffe took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, was convicted of treason and executed in 1716. The ghost of his wife is reputed to haunt the castle. His brother Charles Radclyffe, also involved in the rebellion, escaped to France, but was (like his brother) attainted of high treason. He returned to support the later 1745 uprising, was captured and executed in 1746 in accordance with the sentence imposed 30 years before. The Derwentwater estates after 1716 The attainder of the 3rd Earl would normally have resulted in his property (including Dilston) passing to the Crown. However, he only had a life interest under his 1712 marriage settlement, so that his estates passed to his 2-year-old son John, who died aged 18. On his death in 1731, the estates would have passed to his uncle Charles Ratclyffe, who was still living abroad, but he had also been attainted in 1716. After him, the estates might have passed to his son James Bartholomew Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Newburgh, but an Act of Parliament (4 Geo. I c.21) had been passed in 1731 amending (\\"explaining\\") an Act of Queen Anne concerning naturalisation (7 Anne, c.5) so as to exclude the children born abroad to attainted persons from being British subjects. This prevented James Lord Kinnaird and any siblings from inheriting (since foreigners could not own land in England). Accordingly, the estate would have reverted to the right heirs of the 3rd Earl, but his interest was also forfeit to the Crown.H. H. E. Craster, A History of Northumberland X, Corbridge, 295-303.Statutes at Large (1758 edition) IV, 5 Geo. II, c.23. The Forfeit Estates Commission had offered for sale in July 1723 the interests in remainder in the Derwentwater estates contingent upon the death without male issue of John. These were purchased by William Smith of Billiter Square, London for ¬£1060. However the sale was irregular, because the original contract was cancelled and a new one made, in the presence of two commissioners (rather than the quorum of four) and without the sale being re-advertised, as required. Accordingly, the sale was declared void by a 1731 Act.'Report [on] the sale of the estate of James late Earl of Derwentwater' Reports of Committees of the House of Commons I 1716‚Äì1733 (1776), 353-357. The purchase was, according to the Commissioners' Registrar, made on behalf of a group including John Bond, Sir Joseph Eyles and Matthew White. This was a speculative purchase, since it depended on the failure of a prior interest, but in the events which happened, it would have given Smith and his colleagues property worth ¬£5000 per year at the time of the sale, and over ¬£6000 by the time that the sale was questioned. The Commissioners responsible for the invalid sale, Denis Bond and John Birch, were expelled from the Commons for their part in the affair,Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration. but Sir John Eyles and Sir Thomas Hales, who had conducted the original sale and whose names had been written on the final contract suffered no penalty. The 1731 Act directed that the Court of Exchequer should sell the property, but it was not sold. Instead, the Greenwich Hospital Act 1735 directed that Crown income from the estate (after payment of various annuities and the interest on mortgages) should be employed to completing the building of Greenwich Hospital. A further Act was passed in 1738 to deal with difficulties that had arisen under this.Statutes at Large (1758 edition) V, 8 Geo. II, c.29 and 11 Geo. II, c. 30. Following the execution of Charles Ratcliffe in 1746 (in accordance with his 1716 attainder), Lord Kinnaird as his eldest son petitioned the king, claiming to be entitled the estate, but the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital rejected his claim, because his right had not been claimed before the Forfeit Estates Commission, and because he was an alien. Being unable to finance litigation over this, he asked that the king make financial provision for him, and his mother Charlotte Maria Radclyffe, 3rd Countess of Newburgh (with his approval) asked for provision for his brother and three sisters. Accordingly, a compromise was reached that the Hospital Commissioners should pay Lord Kinnaird ¬£24000, and that ¬£6000 should be divided among his siblings, else they would have all become destitute upon the death of their mother.Statutes at Large (1758 edition) VI, 22 Geo. II, c. 52. On the Countess' death in 1755, Lord Kinnaird succeeded as 4th Earl of Newburgh, and lived until 1786. The 5th Earl of Newburgh then applied to Parliament for Restitution of the estates, but was granted an annuity of ¬£2500, which he and his widow enjoyed until the deaths in 1814 and 1861 respectively. The Hospital's revenue from the estates had risen by the 1780s to ¬£15000. The estate remained in the hands of Greenwich Hospital until the Commissioners until it was transferred to the Admiralty Board under Greenwich Hospital Act 1865. The Board then sold the estate to Wentworth Blackett Beaumont, 1st Baron Allendale. Dilston Hall (left uncompleted on the execution of the 3rd Earl) was used as the residence for Greenwich Hospital's steward, but the Commissioners ordered its demolition in 1765, leaving standing only the castle tower and the chapel. Restoration of Castle A restoration of the buildings began in 2001 and the castle was opened to the public for a time in 2003. In 2004, ¬£220,000 was awarded to begin work renovating the early 17th-century bridge (The Lord's Bridge) near the castle, as well as securing the survival of the Jacobean range of buildings with cobbled floor that share the grounds with the castle. The recent excavations have revealed the remains of the demolished Dilston Hall and its 17th-century service range, and have also found evidence of medieval occupation of the site. The restorations of the castle, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, included work on a new roof, repointing, and the construction of a new floor, constructed of timber, and a staircase in the castle to access the upper levels. The castle also shares its grounds with a chapel, which is also protected under the same historic building laws as the castle. The castle is situated on the same grounds as Cambian Dilston College, a residential college for young adults with learning difficulties. The college was originally a maternity ward, until Lord Rix changed it into the current learning difficulties college, having a daughter with LD himself.

The film stars Luke Treadaway, Natalia Tena, Gavin Mitchell and Alastair Mackenzie. Set at T in the Park music festival and shot by Sigma Films, two feuding rock stars are handcuffed together at a festival where they are due to perform. Plot The story centers around two characters Adam (Luke Treadaway) and Morello (Natalia Tena) who end up handcuffed whilst appearing at T in the Park. Adam is the lead singer with successful pop group The Make who are booked to perform at popular music festival in Scotland. While looking for his manager he happens upon Morello, the lead singer for the all girl punk band The Dirty Pinks. The two do not get along and end up arguing, while doing so attracting the attention of a preacher who decides to teach them both a lesson in cooperation and compromise. He handcuffs the two together and disposes of the key, leaving the two stuck together until the handcuffs can be removed. This also means that the two must perform together, an arrangement that both are unhappy with. But over time they both see that they have more in common than first thought and Morello begins to wonder whether she is truly happy with her boyfriend Mark (Alastair Mackenzie). Cast *Luke Treadaway as Adam - one half of globally successful indie duo The Make. *Natalia Tena as Morello - lead singer for all-girl punk band The Dirty Pink‚Äôs. *Mathew Baynton as Tyko - keyboard player and backing vocalist for The Make. *Gavin Mitchell as Bobby - American manager of The Make.

Production You Instead was filmed in 5 days at the 2010 T in the Park Festival in Kinross, Scotland. As the movie was filmed on site at T in the Park the cast and crew were constantly reacting to their surroundings and incorporating them into the performances. The cast and crew camped backstage at the festival instead of the campsite in a specially designed marquee which housed 80 tents. The film was edited daily after shooting was finished for the day as scenes could not be re-shot after the festival was finished. Director David Mackenzie said one of the factors of him casting the two lead parts was that, \\"Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena both have musical experience ‚Äì Luke‚Äôs first movie called Brothers of the Head involved him and his brother playing in some proto-punk band, and Natalia‚Äôs got her own band called Molotov Jukebox who are very good.\\". Two of the songs performed in the film were written by Treadaway and Tena. Festival Setting T in the Park Mainstage T in the Park is a major music festival held in Balado, Kinross-shire, Scotland. The festival's opening year was in 1994 and it has been held annually since. The festival's main sponsor is Tennents Brewery, the reason for the 'T' in the title, and is sponsored by DF Concerts. The festival was originally held in Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire for the first four years and ran for two days but since then has changed to a three- day weekend with the option of an extra Thursday night camping. The festival has been the host to many famous bands over the years with acts including Foo Fighters, Eminem, Green Day and The Killers. The festival director Geoff Ellis says \\"The film really captures the spirit of what T in the Park is about!\\" It allows the viewers of the film to experience the festival through the eyes of bands that travel to T in the Park instead of just attending as a regular guest, thus really allowing the full T in the park experience. Release You Instead premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival in March 2011, and went on limited release in September 2011. The film was also shown to Thursday night campers at the festival the following year, 2011. The festival is known to show films to campers to occupy their time on Thursday as there is no live music performed until the Friday of the festival. You Instead Director David Mackenzie said: \\"After shooting the film entirely at last year's T in the Park, it was only natural that we brought it back to where it was born, one year on.\\" Reception You Instead was released to poor to mixed reaction from critics.

Exporail. Founded in 1907, it is owned by the governmental entity the Montreal Port Authority. However, its operations are run separately from the port as a for-profit arm. About 100 km (60 miles) of track are under the railroad's jurisdiction, and junctions are present with both CN and Canadian Pacific. Containers are ferried by rail to the interchange area or loaded directly onto trains. An average of about 45 trains operate per week. As of 2015, the railway has a maintenance team of about 20 people, working 365 days a year. The railway handles about 60 to 80 trains per week over the 100 km of track, with 168 switch points to be maintained. The port entrance off Boucherville Street sees about 2500 trucks daily that enter or exit the facility. Expansion In 2017, an investment of $18.4 million (Canadian dollars) from the Canadian government, the Quebec government and the Port Authority allowed the construction of an additional 6km of track, to handle in increase in container volumes at the Port. As of the date of the announcement, around 45 % of the container cargo at the port was shipped out by rail. Roster In 2010, the railway had a fleet of 6 diesel electric locomotives.

Described as a new species in 2010, it is known only from the semi-arid region in the National Park of Catimbau of Brazil. The mushroom is characterized by a stout fruit body with a smooth and sticky orange cap up to in diameter. The gills on the underside of the cap are closely spaced and frequently anastomosed. The stem is long by thick. The mushrooms exude a sparse cream- colored latex when cut or injured. Discovery and classification The species was found in the Brazilian semi-arid region in the National Park of Catimbau, in July 2007. It was described as new to science in a 2010 Mycotaxon publication by Felipe Wartchow of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. L. rupestris is one of 19 species of Lactarius known from Brazil. The epithet rupestris refers to the campos rupestres montane savanna‚Äîthe ecoregion where the type species was collected. The authors note that the fungus does not readily fit into any of the infrageneric (i.e., below the level of genus) classification schemes outlined by previous authorities. For example, although L. rupestris has several characteristics that make the section Edules proposed by Annemieke Verbeken a somewhat close match, the taxon cannot be included because the surface of its cap is neither sufficiently areolate (cracked) nor dry enough, and its spores are excessively ornamented in comparison. Description The cap of L. rupestris is , concave to somewhat funnel- shaped, with a central depression. Its color is orange at the center to brownish-orange towards the margin. The cap surface is somewhat sticky, and the texture is either smooth to slightly cracked. It has an indistinct layer of matted mycelial \\"hairs\\". The margin lacks striations and grooves, and is curled inward slightly. The gills are slightly decurrent (running slightly down the length of the stem), cream-salmon in color, and crowded closely together. They are up to broad and are frequently branched. The gill edges are smooth, and the same color as the gill face. There are several tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) interspersed between the gills. The stem is long by thick, centrally attached to the stem, cylindrical, and tapers slightly near the base. It is pale ochraceous-salmon, and slight longitudinal ribs can be seen with a magnifying glass. The flesh is spongy, pale yellow-ochre in the cap, and cream-yellow in the stem. The latex is cream-colored to roughly the same color as the gills, and not abundant. =Microscopic characteristics= The spores are roughly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, and typically measure 7‚Äì8.5 by 6‚Äì7 ¬µm. The ornamentation on the spore surface is amyloid (staining blue to blue- black in Melzer's reagent) and finely wart-like, with each wart ranging to 0.5‚Äì0.7 ¬µm high. The warts are interconnected by thin ridges, but the ridges do not form a complete reticulum. The hilar appendage (the part of a spore once attached to the basidium via the sterigma) ranges in shape from narrowly obtuse to somewhat conical; the plage is not very distinct, but has an amyloid spot. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are 35‚Äì50 by 8‚Äì11 ¬µm, club-shaped, and bear mainly four, but sometimes two long (6‚Äì10 ¬µm) sterigmata. Pseudopleurocystidia are very scarce on the gill faces; when present, they are thin-walled, 170 ¬µm long by 24 ¬µm wide, with brownish refractive contents, and arise from deep in the tissue of the hymenophore. The edge of the gill is sterile (lacking basidia), and has marginal cells that are 30‚Äì45 by 4‚Äì6 ¬µm, cylindrical to somewhat sinuous (curvy), thin-walled, and hyaline (translucent). The tissue of the cap has abundant sphaerocysts (spherical, swollen cells common to the Russulaceae) and measure 25‚Äì65 by 24‚Äì50 ¬µm, in addition to filamentous hyphae that are up to 10 ¬µm wide. Lactiferous (latex-containing) hyphae are common in the cap tissue. They are up to 15 ¬µm wide with a longitudinal orientation. Although they diverge from the trama somewhat (spreading out from the center of the gill), they do not form projecting pseudocystidia. The subhymenium (the layer of cells directly under the hymenium) is made of club-shaped to nearly spherical cells that are 16‚Äì27 by 9‚Äì17 ¬µm. The tissue that comprises the hymenophore is made of several parts. It contains abundant, nearly isodiametric (17‚Äì25 by 13‚Äì18 ¬µm) cells, and filamentous hyphae that measure 3.5‚Äì6.5 ¬µm; lactiferous hyphae are frequent, up to 7‚Äì12 ¬µm wide, straight and only occasionally branching. The cap cuticle is a trichoderm‚Äîmeaning the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. It is up to 140 ¬µm thick and comprises two layers. The upper layer, the suprapellis, is made of plentiful, colorless hyphae that are 20‚Äì51 by 4‚Äì6 ¬µm, thin-walled (up to 0.5 ¬µm), and range in shape from obtuse to somewhat acute to knob-like or pear- shaped. The lower layer of the cap cuticle, the subpellis, is made of both plentiful hyphae that are 3‚Äì8 ¬µm wide and somewhat more inflated colorless cells up to 10‚Äì18 ¬µm wide. Lactarius rupestris does not have clamp connections in its hyphae. Habitat and distribution The mushroom is known only from Vale do Catimbau National Park in Brazil. The mushroom was found buried with up to two-thirds of the stem in sandy soil near several shrubs (Fabaceae, subfamily Mimosoideae and others) in a semi-arid region, after heavy precipitation. The species is known only from the type locality in Vale do Catimbau National Park in Brazil, in the state of Pernambuco. It fruits at an elevation of . This is part of the biodiverse cerrado ecoregion, in an area known as the campos rupestres. Although the fungus is suspected to be mycorrhizal (like all Lactarius), there was a wide diversity of plant species growing in the open, dry forest where the mushroom was found (including members of the tree families Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Myrtaceae, Nyctaginaceae, and Polygonaceae‚Äîall known to form mycorrhizal associations), so the authors did not speculate on any specific interactions.

In a world of ever increasing water demand and decline in water availability and/or reliability, where water-related hazards are on rise, where climate change threatens to undo decades of development efforts, the only way to sustainability is a right mix of mutually strengthening policy instruments. In this policy mix, Economic Policy Instruments (EPIs) are best suited to foster an efficient allocation and use of water, reduce harmful exposure and impacts on the communities and environment, and protect natural capital. EPIs are regulations that encourage behaviour through market signals rather than through explicit directives‚Äù.Stavins, R. N. ‚ÄúExperience with market-based environmental policy instruments.‚Äù In: Handbook of Environmental Economics, edited by Karl-G√∂ran M√§ler and Jeffrey Vincent, 1:355‚Äì435. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2003. They are a means of correcting market signals in order to convey the costs of externalities to economic actors (individuals as well as firms) which have generated them. Regarding water policies, economic instruments comprise regulations like those creating virtual market conditions (tradable permits), charges for public services, payments for ecosystem services, and transfer payments such as incentives based on taxation, levies, fees and royalties and subsidies. They represent an alternative to more traditional command and control instruments. Whereas already introduced into climate policies, air quality and energy policies, their application to water policies represents some specific challenges. In Environmental Policy, economic instruments have received increasing attention over the last decades, and have been implemented to achieve environmental policy objectives such as climate policy under the form of Emission Trading. However, although EPIs have been proved to perform better than alternative instruments (command and control instruments or voluntary agreements) in other domains of environmental policies, their application to tackle water management issues (drought/water scarcity, floods, and water quality) are beset by many difficulties both of practical and ethical character: Despite the Dublin statement on sustainable water management adopted by the UN in 1992 which stating, in its fourth principle, that \\"Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good\\"THE DUBLIN STATEMENT ON WATER AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/hwrp/documents/english/icwedece.html the conception of water as an economic (and tradable) good is not accepted unanimously; especially Human rights groups see this principle in contradiction to the Right to water.  Categories of instruments  = Water tariffs = Charges for the use of water are among the best known economic instruments for water policies. They can contribute to the transmission of market signals which are coherent with policy aims, if their design is transparent and revenues are earmarked to uses connected to the service or to the mitigation of impacts from water uses. Charges for water uses potentially aim at different objectives: (a) redistribution the costs water service operators bear for water related services among the users, cover costs for service provision; (b) distribute social costs of resource uses, for instance environmental costs, among users, (c) attribute water uses to the economically most efficient type of uses according to their ability to pay for water uses.  Environmental taxes  Taxes on the use of water as an environmental good, for instance on the use of ground water, can help internalizing negative environmental impacts and/or collect financial resources for the public budget. The earmarking of environmental taxes (making the use of the resources collected transparent and coherent to the environmental function of the tax) is a central issue for the acceptance of the tool.  Environmental charges  Like environmental taxes, charges can transmit signals for internalizing negative environmental impacts and influence behaviour, and to collect financial resources that are allocated to support environmental friendly practices and projects. = Tradable permits = As water normally is not a traded good, the establishment of specific rights or tradeable permits are a means for using market mechanisms for the allocation of limited water resources. Creating virtual markets tradeable permits for water uses can improve the allocation (increase the efficiency) of resources to the economically most efficient uses. Virtual markets can be created either with regards to quantities of water to be used/abstracted or levels of pollution conceded to potential polluters. { style=\\"float: right; background: #B8D2DD; border:1px solid\\" margin:.46em 0 0 .2em;\\" + !

Compensation mechanisms  Payments and charges on the deterioration of environmental goods can be substituted by mechanisms where environmental degradation leads to financial payment that is allocated to alternative actions to compensate for the degradation. Compensation can also be provided by third parties, for instance insurances. = Payment for ecosystem services = Water bodies provide ecosystem services consisting of flood protection, biodiversity support and remediation. These functions are generally not considered as economic benefits, although they are used as inputs for social activities. Introduction of payment schemes can potentially support the maintenance of natural functions of water bodies.  Evaluating Economic Policy Instruments for Water Policies  The EPI-WATER research project funded by the founded by European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme, sets to assess the effectiveness and the efficiency of Economic Policy Instruments in achieving water policy goals, and to identify the preconditions under which they complement or perform better than alternative (e.g. regulatory or voluntary) policy instruments. Using a common multi-dimensional assessment framework, the project will compare the performance of single economic instruments or their apposite combinations with the performance otherwise achievable with regulatory (command & control) interventions (such as water restriction/rationing, licensing or permitting), persuasive instruments or voluntary commitments. Furthermore the project will identify remaining research and methodological issues that need to be addressed, in particular with regards to the further development and use of national accounting, for supporting the design, implementation and evaluation of EPI in the field of water management. The assessment is based on the analysis of case studies on experiences for the implementation of economic policy instruments for water policies throughout European Member states and beyond and on ex post simulation of impacts and environmental outcomes of the application of selected instruments to water policy issues in EU member states. The project is coordinated by Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei.

It is endemic to a small area of the coastal mountains of south-eastern Brazil where its natural habitat is moist forest. It grows on trees as an epiphyte. It is one of the parents of many of the popular houseplants known as Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus. Description Schlumbergera russelliana resembles other species of the genus Schlumbergera in that it has leafless green stems which act as photosynthetic organs. The stems (cladodes) are composed of strongly flattened segments, which have a small number of notches along their edges. Individual segments are about long by wide. Special structures characteristic of cacti, called \\"areoles\\", occur in the notches at the side of a segment and at the end. The areoles, which bristles up to long, are where the flower buds appear. The flowers hang downwards and are radially symmetrical (regular). They are about long by across. The tepals, which are of various shades of pink, are arranged in two groups, giving the appearance of a \\"flower within a flower\\". The inner tepals are longer and fused together at the base to form a floral tube about long; nectar is produced at the base of this tube. Plants flower in the spring; when cultivated in the Northern Hemisphere the flowering period is February to April. A characteristic of the genus Schlumbergera is that the many stamens are arranged in two series: the inner stamens form a ring around the style; the outer stamens arise from the floral tube. The stamens are pale pink with pink pollen. The style has six to eight lobes at its end and is darker pink. The fruit is greenish-yellow, with four to five ribs. The shiny seeds are dark brown, each with a diameter of about . Taxonomy The species was discovered for science in Brazil in 1837 by George Gardner, whose patron was John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. It was first named in 1839 by W.J. Hooker as Epiphyllum russellianum; the epithet was Gardner's suggestion to honour his patron. In 1858 Charles Lemaire created the genus Schlumbergera for this species ‚Äì which is thus the type species of the genus ‚Äì but changed the specific epithet to epiphylloides, which is not allowed under the current rules of botanical nomenclature; he should have called it Schlumbergera russelliana, which is its current name. Synonyms include: * Epiphyllum russellianum Hooker * Cereus russellianus Gardner ex Hooker * Phyllocactus russellianus (Hooker) Salm-Dyck * Schlumbergera epiphylloides Lem., nom. illeg. Distribution and habitat Schlumbergera russelliana occurs only in a small area of the coastal mountains of south-east Brazil, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, located in the southernmost part of the tropics. It has only been found in the Organ Mountains (Serra dos √ìrg√£os) in the Parque Nacional da Serra dos √ìrg√£os. Plants grow at altitudes of . Because of their altitude and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the coastal mountains have high humidity ‚Äì warm moist air is forced upwards into higher, colder locations where it condenses. S. russelliana usually grows on trees (epiphytic). Cultivation Cultivar in the S. Buckleyi Group Schlumbergera russelliana is mainly grown in the form of its hybrids with other species of the genus, particularly the hybrid S. russelliana √ó S. truncata, which has been called S. √ó buckleyi (T.Moore) Tjaden or S. Buckleyi Group. The hybrid S. orssichiana √ó S. russelliana has also been made in cultivation; it has been given the name S. √ó eprica S√ºpplie.

Gold (born 1949) is an American physician, professor, author, and researcher on the effects of opioids, cocaine, tobacco, and other drugs as well as food on the brain and behavior. Gold is a former professor in the Department of Neuroscience, distinguished professor, and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Florida College of Medicine, where he founded the Division of Addiction Medicine. His translational research has led to an understanding of the role of the nucleus locus coeruleus in addiction, the discovery of clonidine‚Äôs efficacy in opiate withdrawal, and the dopamine depletion hypothesis in understanding cocaine addiction. Education and career  Gold earned his bachelor‚Äôs degree from Washington University in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Florida College of Medicine with his medical degree. He then completed a psychiatry residency and fellowship at Yale School of Medicine. Since beginning his career in research at University of Florida in 1970, he has authored over 1,000 scientific articles, chapters, and abstracts published in journals for neuroscientists and health professionals, with collaborators at Yale, Princeton, and Washington University in St. Louis. In addition to conducting research, Gold was a distinguished professor of psychiatry, neuroscience, community health, and family medicine at UF. He became interim chairman and then chair of the UF Department of Psychiatry in 2008. During his tenure, he founded the Division of Addiction Medicine and its treatment program, the Florida Recovery Center. He also started laboratory studies in the UF McKnight Brain Institute on a wide range of topics with mentees, including second-hand tobacco smoke, sugar and drug self-administration, and fentanyl and opioid drug-induced anhedonia and reversal. From 2011-2014, Gold was the 17th University of Florida Distinguished Alumni Professor, where he had university-wide responsibilities and was honored by UF Dean Michael Good at the university's 2011 homecoming game. After retiring as a full-time academic in 2014, he has continued teaching, research and writing as a University of Florida Emeritus Eminent Scholar, clinical professor at the University of Southern California, Tulane University, and the Washington University School of Medicine Departments of Psychiatry. Dr. Gold is an active member of the National Council at the Washington University School of Medicine‚Äôs Public Health Institute. Research interests Gold‚Äôs work has focused on developing scientific laboratory models for understanding drug, food, and other addictions that have led to new treatments. Gold was a lead researcher in the discovery of clonidine‚Äôs efficacy in opiate withdrawal and a rationale for opiate withdrawal symptomatology. Clonidine was the first non- opioid medication to reverse acute opioid withdrawal symptoms. He also co- authored the dopamine depletion hypothesis (Patent #4/312,878) for cocaine addiction and anhedonia. His work helped lead to a new understanding of how cocaine is addicting and the physiology of cocaine craving and ‚Äúcrashing.‚Äù Gold developed addiction-based models for understanding hedonistic overeating, food addiction, and the development of new therapies. He is co-editor of the 2012 textbook, Food and Addiction, published by Oxford Press, and has worked to evaluate the hypothesis that hedonistic overeating is a pathological attachment to food like any other addiction. His group had the first report in the medical literature on crack, addiction to second-hand tobacco, and cannabis smoke. Gold has also researched methamphetamine and, with NIDA‚Äôs Jean Lud Cadet M.D., described the drug‚Äôs long-lasting effects in a series of studies from rodents to human post-mortem; physician and health professionals who have become addicts and their outcomes after treatment; and internet and other behavioral addictions. Additional research interests include the role of exercise in neurodegeneration and recovery, treatment-resistant opioid use disorders, and reward deficiency syndrome.  Honors and other roles  Gold was the Chief Scientist working on national and global research on addiction and its effects. He was chief scientist of the Afghanistan National Urban Drug Use Survey for the US State Department and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The survey identified second- and third-hand opium exposure among children in Kabul and other urban Afghan areas. Gold also studied smoking, as well as second- and third-hand tobacco smoke, with support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and FAMRI. He has extended this model to study cannabis smoke and withdrawal. He worked with the White House‚Äôs Office of National Drug Control Policy, Media Partnership for a Drug Free America, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, the Betty Ford Center Foundation in the area of drug use and youth and the DEA Museum, where he was a founding director. Gold has received numerous recognitions for his work, including Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha; Addiction Policy Forum Pillar of Excellence Award for research; the John P. McGovern Award for his contributions to public policy, treatment, research and addiction prevention; National Association Addiction Treatment and Policy Lifetime Achievement Award; and the Chinese National Academy of Sciences, International Scientist Award. At the University of Florida, Gold was named a Donald Dizney Eminent Scholar and University Distinguished Professor. He was given Inventor Awards from UF‚Äôs Office of Technology Transfer and the annual White Coat Ceremony was named in his honor. Gold continues to analyze and present epidemiological research on the opioid and emerging cocaine epidemics and behavioral addictions. He has written and lectured on responses to reduce overdose deaths, medication-assisted therapies, and opioid use disorders. He regularly lectures at medical schools; Grand Rounds; and national scientific meetings on opioids, cocaine, and the bench-to-bedside science in eating disorders, obesity, and addictions. Recently, he was editor of the World Federation of Neurology's Journal of Neurological Sciences Special Issue on Addiction Medicine 2020.

He came to Imperial College in London in 1948 to work on microwave spectrometry and nuclear physics. Nine years later he joined CERN in Geneva, where he was appointed leader of a large group of scientists developing the CESAR accelerator facility.

No big anti-nuclear weapons demonstration in the 1980s was complete without Pentz's large, lumberjacketed presence, leading a march or gracing a platform.\\" As an opponent of nuclear deterrence and of NATO's doctrine of flexible response, Pentz believed that a nuclear war could not in any way remain limited, and would inevitably lead to widespread destruction. Consequently, Pentz became a vocal activist for nuclear disarmament, joining many significant peace marches of the 1970s and 1980s. \\"500 at Hertfordshire Peace Festival\\", Hertfordshire Mercury, 20 May 1983 .

It is generally offered independently of the original borrowing and typically as an alternative to a remortgage onto a fixed rate. As the insurance policy protects only against the risk of the repayments rising because of interest rates (and not of the borrower defaulting on repayments) there is no requirement for the insurer to check the credit status of the purchaser or the value of any secured asset. The absence of arrangement and valuation fees, bank and legal charges means that interest rate insurance can be cheaper to provide than a remortgage. The absence of credit checks and valuations means it can be made available to all holders of a variable rate loan. As interest rate insurance protects the holder from rising interest rates but does not raise their initial pay rate, if interest rates fall, the policyholder will see a benefit in reduced payments on their mortgage or loan when compared to a fixed rate alternative.Remortgage Options, Daily Telegraph, 5 May 2011  History (UK)  Monetary Policy Committee member Professor David Miles first highlighted interest rate insurance in the Miles Review The UK Mortgage Market: Taking a longer-term view in 2004 commissioned by Gordon Brown.

He was born in Valencia but completed the majority of his work in Marbella. Prior to his career as an artist, de Espona worked as a consulting lawyer at the Banco Popular Espa√±ol in Barcelona. In 1950, he requested a leave of absence from the bank to move to Brazil, where he dedicated his life to artistic pursuits. Works De Espona's publicly- displayed work is primarily located in S√£o Paulo, Marbella, and San Pedro de Alc√°ntara. = S√£o Paulo = De Espona lived in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, between 1957 and 1968. His work primarily consisted of paintings, sculptures, and engravings. De Espona conducted two annual art exhibitions in different cities, including Sorocaba, San Jose Dos Campos, Limeira, Araracuara, Riber√≥n Preto, Uberaba, Uberlandia, Goiania, Belo Horizonte, Caldas, Rio de Janeiro, Niteroi, Juiz de Fora, and Porto Alegre. De Espona's art studio in the city was later opened to the public. During his time in Brazil, de Espona also completed freelance work with international advertising agencies and illustrated books and magazine covers. One of his projects was chosen as part of a building contest at the Igapoo lakeside, a large summer residence which came to be called a \\"Spiritual Retreat\\". For this project, he created a large stone mural 125 square meters in size at the entrance of Londrina. =Marbella= Between 1971 and 1995 de Espona worked in Marbella. Many of his works can be seen in the streets and squares of the city. The throne he made to Our Father Jesus entry into Jerusalem, a confraternity in Marbella, was made of wood and bronze. The sculptural mural Marbella sun, which for years was the facade, missing, House of Culture of Marbella. He also created the Andalusia Memorial, whose central obelisk stands 6 feet tall. Other works, although not as monumental as the previous ones, also had their place in the architecture for the municipality of Marbella, and goodbye to a friend, the work that decorated the facade of the Parish of Nueva Andaluc√≠a. De Espona also worked on the mural of the eight-meter fa√ßade of the Gimnasio Atenas, called Auto Modelaci√≥n, which is six meters tall. =San Pedro Alc√°ntara (M√°laga)= De Espona's sculpture S√≠ntesis (synthesis, in English) measures 12 meters high and is located in San Pedro de Alc√°ntara. S√≠ntesis represents the patron saint San Pedro de Alc√°ntara and was originally located in the plaza of the church. However, this work was transferred in the early 1990s to the edge of the main road, at the junction adjacent to the Mediterranean Avenue. In 2008 it was removed due to the danger it posed to highway workers, and it was moved to a dump where it was left abandoned for two years. However, in 2010 it was restored, repainted, repaired, and placed in the Teodoro Garc√≠a D√≠ez roundabout next to Ronda Road and the industrial area of the city, welcoming visitors who come to San Pedro by the A357 road from Ronda and across northern Spain. Another de Espona sculpture that stands in this locality is 'Return of the Olivar' which represents a family, with one family member riding on a donkey. It is much smaller than S√≠ntesis and is located in the gardens of the famous palm grove of San Pedro de Alc√°ntara, south of Marqu√©s del Duero.

Functionality  It implies high-end functionality beyond the basic criteria for a smartphone, such as the ability to be more tailored to a specific user's needs. A Superphone usually incorporates state of the art technology, innovations in hardware, and newer refined software. For example, having the latest SoC chip made from OEMs such as Qualcomm or Intel. A superphone could also imply a certain set of physical characteristics that is unique, unusual, innovative, and not regularly seen in smartphones; an example of this are the edge-to-edge \\"bezel-less\\" displays found in higher-end smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 or the Essential Phone.  Examples  An appropriate example of a Superphone is the LG G Flex 2. The body is curved horizontally, making it less likely to break when bent, for example when one sits on the phone by accident. The back of the G Flex 2 is coated with a material that 'self-heals' within minutes when scratched. The Moto Z can also be considered an example of a Superphone for its innovative \\"Moto Mods\\", a set of individual modules which can be magnetically attached on the back to greatly extend the functionality of the phone. Many flagship smartphones from various OEMs (Samsung, LG, HTC) can be considered to be Superphones, as the term flagship refers to the OEMs most high-end offering. Both terms can be used simultaneously to convey the same meaning.  Criteria  Plausible criteria for Superphones in 2017 include: * Minimum of 1080p (Full-HD) display, 1440p (Quad-HD) displays are preferable. 4K-screens are anticipated. * Screen display larger than 5-inches (125 mm) (may overlap with phablet). * Screen display features minimal bezels, adopting the 'bezel-less' form factor * USB-C port, instead of the older Micro-USB 2.0 * The addition of a fingerprint or iris scanner for extra security * Hardware is built out of high-end durable materials * A dual camera system, either for increasing the field of view, the optical zoom, and/or to enhance the color reproduction of the image * Supports NFC. * Supports Qi Wireless Charging. * Supports Quick Charging. * Ability to replace system software and user-interface of the phone using 3rd party software. * Ability to add certain modules to extend the functionality of the phone * Multi-core processor and dedicated 3D-graphics, minimum of 1.5 GHz. * At least 4GB of RAM. * Large capacity battery, larger than 3000mAh. * High-speed internet 100Mbit/s WWAN capabilities or higher. * Has Hi-Fi audio capabilities built into the phone.

Designed in 1986, the construction of the hotel started in the 1990s. However, the completion was delayed for nearly two decades and the hotel was opened on 10 August 2011 at a cost of 5.50 billion. Built on an 83-ground land, it is the first Hyatt hotel in South India and has 325 rooms. History Hyatt Regency Chennai From a map of the city in 1942, the property can be traced back to a house called \\"Teynampet Villa\\", a government property allotted to P. S. Viswanatha Iyer, ICS, in the late 1940s. The area was then occupied by a bungalow named \\"Abbotsbury.\\" In the 1950s, it was replaced by C. S. Loganatha Mudaliar with the city‚Äôs first purpose-built community hall, which was later sold out to J. H. Tarapore. Soon the Tarapore property was gifted to the Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, who later sold it to Magunta Subbarami Reddy, the founder of the Balaji Group of Hotels. The structure was demolished to build a luxury hotel with a helipad with about 320 rooms and 250,000 sq ft of commercial space. With the collaboration of the Oberoi Group of Hotels, Balaji Group of Hotels started building the structure in 1989 at a cost of 2.90 billion. However, after the murder of Magunta Subbarami Reddy, the group was caught in a financial crisis and the work on the project, initially named Magunta Oberoi, ceased in 2000 when about 75 percent of the work was complete. Consequently, the Oberois withdrew from the project the same year and it could not be completed in time. In 2006, the unfinished property was to be acquired by Lalit Suri, for 3.90 billion. However, after the death of Lalit Suri, Robust Hotels Private Limited, belonging to the Saraf Group, purchased the unfinished hotel development from IFCI and TFCI in mid-2007 and appointed Confluence, an international consultancy firm, to manage the completion of the project, which started remodelling the structure in 2008 and completed in February 2011. The retail space was bought from ICICI by Ramee Guestline Hotels. With the acquisition by the Saraf Group, the hotel was opened as Hyatt Regency Chennai on 8 August 2011.

Biography =Early life= Ragel Gonzalez was born in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain on December 22, 1899 to a middle-class family. His father, Diego Gonz√°lez Lozano, owned a photography studio and taught his son photography. At age nine, Ragel Gonzalez's mother died and his father spent less time with him. Ragel Gonzalez attended the College of the Marianists, but dropped out due to conflicts with teachers.. At age 16, Ragel Gonzalez and his brother Diego moved to Madrid. Ragel Gonzalez enrolled in the School of Arts and Crafts, but did not finish his studies there. It was reported because his style of painting was not acceptable at the school. Ragel Gonzalez returned to Jerez to work with his father and his brother Javier in the photography studio. =Career= Raguel Gonzalez created a form of pictorial expression that he called \\"Esqueletomaquia\\". He defined that as \\"... the art of seeing beyond what reach our eyes. \\" He sees living things as they are in their transitional passage on earth, but as they will take some time after buried or enclosed in a niche. It's death, in his representation of skeleton pruning. Moreover, by virtue of his strange and peculiar vision, skulls or skeletons of their \\"victims\\" have a strong physiognomic resemblance and body. It is recognized immediately. For their studies of the human body, used, no doubt, of the films included in the work of Andreas Vesalius' De Humani Fabrica Corporis \\"published in 1543 and which had an issue. heir skeletons represent the destination to death with a black sense of humor of its author as well as analyzing expression of a society. Rachel laughs at death and it makes her smile and harmless. His creations do not inspire terror or darken thoughts. Their dead are funny people, jocund, who have not learned yet that they no longer live or still \\"good health\\". Pablo Picasso admired his painting was an attempt to represent life and death of critically and poignant true to his nature. Ragel Gonzalez staged six exhibitions. He opened the first on February 16, 1931 with figures as skeletons in the Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition emphasized drawings and caricatures, from politicians to ordinary people. After Ragel Gonzalez closed his photography studio, he spent his time painting, with periods of high production and others of inactivity. Jose Franco said in an article published in World Chart in 1931 that RGonzalez works are full of \\"satirical prints\\" with which the author makes a critical social and human aspects of the time using \\"metamorphosis and deformation reality. \\" In 1936, Ragel Gonzalez, suffering from alcoholism, first entered the Psychiatric Hospital of Malaga. After leaving the hospital, he and his wife Amalia went to Seville. However, his condition deteriorated again and he was admitted to the Psychiatric Hospital in Seville. In 1937 Ragel Gonzalez held his third exhibition in Seville, exhibiting esqueleotomaquias of celebrities and politicians. Back in Jerez lives in a house on the road cutting to the christening as Villa Esqueletom√°quia. In this house lives with great hardship and in which it said was missing anything. There was no lack of truth and the phone, ham, cheese and the maid were painted on the wall. In 1941 the hotel celebrated its fourth exhibition Swan with pictures similar to that of Seville, and in 1942 set out in the Hotel Palace in Madrid. From that date onwards his painting became darker, with translation of states of suffering and nightmares, similar to what happened to Goya. =Later life= In 1955 Ragel Gonzalez held his last exhibition at the Swan Hotel. He was soon admitted to the sanatorium of St. John of God in Ciempozuelos, where he spent the rest of his life. Ragel Gongazlez continued to draw and paint. He created esqueletomaquias of Don Quixote, Goya, and Van Gogh. On November 28, 1969 Ragel Gonzalez died. =Legacy= From December 2007 to March 2008 an exhibition entitled The Spanish Night was held at the Museo Nacional Reina Sofia Modern Art. Flamenco, avant-garde and popular culture 1865-1939. Twelve of his works were displayed.

Miss Emily is described as ‚Äúa small, fat woman‚Äù who lived within a modernizing town full of people who saw her as a very cold, very distant woman who lived in her past., Faulkner, William, section I. Throughout the story, she is referred to by her fellow townspeople as a tradition, a duty, and a care, and is portrayed as a very mean, stubborn old woman. However, as her story unfolds, Faulkner wants readers to sympathize with her because of the amount of loss that she's had to cope with throughout her life. Character Miss Emily is a ‚Äúhereditary obligation upon the town‚Äù in which she lived. The townspeople find themselves looking after her after her father's death. Miss Emily is often misunderstood because she is portrayed as being incapable of being alone while also exhibiting a sense of authority over the town by disregarding the laws of which they live by. For example, not paying her taxes, not putting numbers on her mailbox for the federal mail service, not telling the druggist why she needed arsenic, and parading around town with Homer Barron. After purchasing the arsenic the townspeople thought she was going to kill herself, but being the misunderstood character that she is, Miss Emily has other plans. Miss Emily's physical appearance also displays her deeper character. The way that Faulkner portrays her external changes is parallel to how she internally changes. Miss Emily's actions cause readers to view her in a different connotation: a way in which is cautious and apprehensive as a result of her radical behaviors towards the end of her life. Readers will find themselves feeling sympathetic towards Miss Emily in the beginning but much less for her in the end of the story because of her sinister actions and questionable character. Miss Emily's character symbolizes the fall of the chivalric American South as the industrial, modern South begins to rise The description of the decay of both herself and the house slowing becoming ‚Äúdecaying eyesores‚Äù add to the imagery of things associated with Miss Emily. These things help show how the surroundings are advancing and Miss Emily, the symbol of the classic South, is stubborn and does not want change. Her character is described as ‚Äúbloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water‚Ä¶her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough‚Äù. The reoccurring reminder that Miss Emily is stuck in the past symbolizes that the South is not ready to industrialize and let go of its classic ways. Miss Emily‚Äôs Father Miss Emily had a father who sought to stifle Emily with his rules, regulations, and demands. This was apparent when Miss Emily was ‚Äúthirty and ‚Ä¶ still single.‚Äù, Faulkner, William, section II. He believed that no one in town was good enough for Miss Emily and she had to be protected from dishonor and those beneath her. The town ‚Äúhad long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her clutching a horsewhip.‚Äù Despite Mr. Grierson ruling a huge aspect of Emily's life, it was clear that Miss Emily truly loved and cared for him when he died. ‚ÄúThe day after his death all the ladies prepared to call at the house ‚Ä¶ as is ‚Ä¶ custom Miss Emily met them at the door, dressed as usual ‚Ä¶ with no trace of grief on her face. She told them that her father was not dead.‚Äù Miss Emily proceeded to do this for three days until ‚Äúshe broke down, and they buried her father quickly.‚Äù This passion and love for her father contributed to the impact that loss had on her heart in the future. Emily Grierson's Home Emily lives in Jefferson, Mississippi. Her home \\"was a big, squarish frame house\\", and she did not have to pay taxes on it. Colonel Sartoris' decided to allow her to be waived from taxes after the death of her father. The home was described as one \\"that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies.‚Äù As the town began to modernize, ‚Äúonly Miss Emily‚Äôs house was left, lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and the gasoline pumps- an eyesore among eyesores.‚Äù The house ‚Äúsmelled of dust and disuse‚Äîa close, dank smell,‚Äù and ‚Äúwas furnished in heavy, leather-covered furniture.‚Äù As the people in the community move around her house, ‚Äúa faint dust rose sluggishly about their thighs, spinning with slow motes in the single sun-ray.‚Äù At one point, the townspeople also complained of a mysterious odor coming from her house. They later on find that this odor was coming from the body of Homer Barron, whom was dead and decaying in the house. This home held the body of Homer in a room that was locked up for several years, which was not discovered until the death of Miss Emily, when people began to look through her home. The Tragedies in Miss Emily‚Äôs Life = Death of Her Father = Many people found that when Miss Emily's father died, ‚Äúat last they could pity Miss Emily.‚Äù[2], Faulkner, William, section II. ‚ÄúBeing left alone, and a pauper‚Äù Miss Emily was now completely alone in this new and quite foreign society. She feared being alone because her father who was once always there was no longer and she didn't have a companion to fall back on after ‚Äúall the young men her father had driven away.‚Äù = Disappearance of Her Fianc√© = In that room, the longest kept secret, and the biggest surprise was then found: ‚ÄúThe man himself lay in the bed.‚Äù, Faulkner, William, section V. The greatest shock, however, came not from the rotting body but from what they saw next to this decaying corpse. The people in Miss Emily's house ‚Äúnoticed that in the second pillow was the indentation of a head.‚Äù After looking closely they then found ‚Äúa long strand of iron-gray hair.‚Äù Miss Emily had loved this man, and loved having him in her life. In order to keep him permanently around, she bought poison from a druggist. Many of the people in the community assumed that this poison would be for Miss Emily to kill herself., Faulkner, William, section IV. The community then realized, after coming upon this secret, that this poison was to keep Homer in Miss Emily's life. One writer, Gary Kriewald, notes that Miss Emily's \\"strategic retreat into the sanctuary of her house after Homer Barron's 'desertion' of her is as defiant as it is self-protective, an act of passive resistance directed against a society.\\"  Psychoanalysis of Miss Emily's Character  Emily's life was spent mostly in isolation, not only physically but emotionally. Her father's strict, authoritarian parenting style did not let her socialize to meet friends or possible love interests. Once her father passed, Emily felt the loneliest she was in her life, since her father was all she had. She was not close with her townspeople, and constantly was not approved of. When Homer went missing, she once again felt that loneliness. It is suggested that Miss Emily's loneliness caused her to become a stubborn person, which would explain her constant refusal to pay taxes on her home in Jefferson. It is evident that Miss Emily suffered psychological trauma from her relationship with her father, which suggests why she acted the way she did later on in her life, keeping the body of her fianc√© after he died. It is possible that Miss Emily suffered from Necrophilia, since she felt so connected still to Homer; enough to keep his body for several years after death. She wanted to be happy with Homer for the rest of her life, could not handle the rejection, so she killed him with poison, and kept his body in her home. Her refusal to give up her father's body for days after his death, then keeping Homer's for years suggests that she feels that she is too stubborn to let go, and that she feels that she can still have a connection with them even after death.

He used to denounce cases of violence and abuses of power, especially during his homilies. His intention to organize his people to recover the ancestral lands, created tensions with landowners that accused him of uprising. He was murdered by two men on November 10, 1984 in Santander de Quilichao. The crime remains unpunished.  Life  He was the son of Mar√≠a Soledad Chocu√© Pe√±a and Jos√© Domingo Ulcu√© Yaju√©, who was governor of the Indigenous Council. Ulcu√© could start his formal education only when he was 11 in the school of Pueblo Nuevo, Caldono, Cauca. The school was run by the nuns founded by Mother Laura. He finished his primary at the Indocrespo, a residence for Catholic indigenous young people in Guadarrama (Antioquia Department) intended to ordain indigenous clergy in Colombia. He continued his education at the Minor Seminar of Popay√°n run by the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, but after 4 years, he had to stop due to financial problems. He became teacher first in San Benito Abad (Sucre) and then at his own indigenous shelter in Cauca. But the Archdioceses and the sisters of Mother Laura helped him to finish his dream to become a priest and they paid the studies at the Seminary of Popay√°n. He finished theology in the seminary of Ibagu√©.  Priesthood  Ulcu√© was ordained as a priest on July 10, 1973 in Popay√°n. He celebrated his first Mass in Pueblo Nuevo, at the side of his Paez people, an event that got the attention of the time, because it was the first time that an indigenous man became a Catholic priest in Colombia. In the occasion he said: \\"In the Seminar we began 62 and now we reached only three: Tom√°s Mina a black, Joel Ortiz, a farmer and me, an indigenous. This is the fulfillment of the prophecy that God chooses the humble to confuse the powerful.\\" But his ministry would not be easy: sensible to the suffering of his own people, especially with the problem of lost of ancestral lands before landowners, he became an object of persecution. He received several threats, especially during the 1980s. First it was his own family that was object of violence: in unclear events his own sister, Gloria, an uncle, Seraf√≠n and other Paez persons, were murdered. His own father was wounded in events where the Colombian Police was involved. After the funeral of his sister and uncle, soldiers searched at his house. At the end of 1982 the indigenous communities denounced the threats against Fr. Ulcu√©, stating that the landowners had put a price to his head. He was not intimidated and he did a travel in 1983 to visit other indigenous communities in Colombia and Ecuador, including Afro-Colombians, also victims of discrimination and abuse.  The conflict of L√≥pez Adentro  The most difficult part came in 1984 with the conflict of L√≥pez Adentro, a part of the Corinto Paez territory that was expropriated by landowners. Fr. Ulcu√© participated in a peaceful recovery of the land on January 25, an action that was answered by a violent participation of Police and Army with the death of 5 indigenous, among them a girl of 7 years old. Fr. Ulcu√© was active providing humanitarian assistance to wounded people and he celebrated a Mass on the site of the recovered land. On November 8 of that same year, the Ministry of Defense, General Oscar Botero Restrepo, visited the troops with other two generals, Ariza and Diaz. Fr. Ulcu√© invited them to his Parish to discuss about the accusations made by the military against his person that were saying that he was promoting the communities to invade private property. He explained to Min Botero the rights of the indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands and the legal character of their claims to recover the indigenous shelters. At the following day of that meeting, on November 9, the army and the Police invaded the land of L√≥pez Adentro, burned 150 indigenous houses and destroyed with machines 300 hectares of farming. \\"The government will always be at the side of the powerful, to defend their interests, but the interests of the poor must be defended by the same organized communities,\\" he said when he knew the news. \\"I invite all Christians and other indigenous companions to rise our voices of protest and to condemn these events as contrary to the Law of God,\\" he asked.  Murder  On Saturday, November 10, 1984 at 8:30 AM, in Santander de Quilichao, Fr. Ulcu√© was attacked by two men in a motorbike when he was driving. He left the car and fell to the ground alive. The two criminals returned and shot him once more. Some nuns nearby brought him to the hospital, but he died few minutes after. Nobody has been prosecuted for this crime. In August 14, 1996, 12 years after, the Colombian Institute for Land Reform, Incora, reestablished the indigenous shelter of Corinto, with the same details claimed by Fr. Ulcu√©, including the land of L√≥pez Adentro. See also  References  * Beltr√°n Pe√±a, Francisco y Lucila Mej√≠a Salazar 1989: La Utop√≠a mueve monta√±as.

Wylie and the Utah Parks Company as inexpensive tourist accommodations on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, in Grand Canyon National Park. Intended to complement the more expensive Grand Canyon Lodge, the cabins and Inn were located near Bright Angel Point, but father back than their more expensive counterparts, near the Grand Canyon North Rim Headquarters. The design of the cabins and the redesign of the Inn building were undertaken by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood. History William Wylie, was an established concessioner in Yellowstone National Park, where he established Wylie's Tent Camps to service automobile-borne tourists. In 1916 Wylie established a similar tent camp, the Wylie Way Camp, at Bright Angel Point with ten sleeping tents and a dining tent, operating in summer months. In 1924 management of the camp was taken over by Wylie's daughter Elizabeth and her husband Thomas H. McKee. Two years later they began building permanent frame cabins, culminating in 38 frame cabins, 16 tented cabins, a central pavilion, utility buildings and a power plant before they were bought out by the Utah Parks Company. The Utah Parks Company was a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, established to feed tourist traffic into the railroad's network in the southwestern United States. The Utah Parks Company operated lodges in Zion and Bryce Canyon national parks and at Cedar Breaks National Monument. The company assigned their company architect, Gilbert Stanley Underwood, to design a new lodge on Bright Angel Point at the edge of the canyon. The Wylie camp was rebuilt under Underwood's guidance in 1929 with a new central lodge with a rustic design and new cabins identical to those offered at the main lodge. A National Park Service-operated campground was established nearby, with rustic bathhouses and an amphitheater. Located about back from Bright Angel Point, the Inn's accommodations were less desirable than the Lodge's, which were almost on the edge of the precipice. The Inn building became a dining facility, then a store. The former tourist cabins became Park Service and concessioner personnel housing. Description The Grand Canyon Inn building is a single-story structure measuring about by with irregular extensions to the rear and a smaller projection to the front. The rustic building is a \\"studs-out\\" structure with the sheathing on the inside of the exposed structural framing. The corners are marked by peeled log posts, similar to those supporting the large porch across the building's front, which has been enclosed. The building features clerestory windows between the porch roof and the main roof. Four studs-out duplex cabins are located to the rear of the Inn. These gabled cabins were built in 1934, with an interior renovation in 1961. The duplexes are T-shaped with individual toilets adjoining in an extension. Ten more duplex cabins, built with shared toilets, are log cabins with stone front porches. They are identical to the Grand Canyon Lodge's \\"regular,\\" \\"economy,\\" or \\"standard\\" cabins. Another 27 cabins are exposed-frame single-family cabins. Other structures include the laundry and the firehouse, as well as a washhouse or former dormitory and a linen house. The North Rim Campground lies just to the south of the Inn. The campground's log restrooms and stone firewood enclosures are included in the historic district for their historical integrity and architectural character. The former Inn, cabins and campground were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1982.

The operation targeted the Egyptian Army. Thirty-eight Egyptian soldiers were killed during the operation as were eight Israelis.Spencer Tucker, The encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli conflict, ABC-CLIO, (2008) p. 1162 Background The 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War resulted in a decisive Israeli victory. However, the Arab nations remained intransigent and were only willing to sign armistice agreements with Israel. Thus, a static situation of ‚Äúno war, no peace,‚Äù emerged. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of Arab refugees now camped alongside Israel's porous borders. The refugees lived in squalor and were kept under martial law.Zeev Schiff, History of the Israeli Army, Straight Arrow Books (1974), pp. 220‚Äì22 Arab governments, but in particular Egypt, sensing the refugees‚Äô discontent, capitalized on the opportunity to recruit embittered Palestinians for armed actions against Israel. At first, the infiltrations and border transgressions took the form of petty banditry and thievery.Schiff, pp. 222‚Äì23 However, by 1954, Egyptian military intelligence was taking an active role in providing various forms of support for Palestinian fedayeen activity.Schiff pp. 224‚Äì25 After an attack by the fedayeen, Israel decided to take decisive action against Egypt for its sponsorship of the Palestinians and initiated Operation Black Arrow.

Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion and Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan demanded a harsh response directed against those believed to have sponsored the atrocity. Prime Minister Moshe Sharett was more hesitant but demurred. The attack On February 28, Ariel Sharon, commander of the Paratroop Brigade was issued the go-ahead to initiate Operation Black Arrow. That night, a force of 150 paratroops, led by Aharon Davidi and Danny Matt attacked an Egyptian base near the city of Gaza. An Egyptian military relief convoy was ambushed en route. In total, either thirty-seven or thirty-eightSpencer Tucker, p. 1162 Egyptian soldiers were killed and many more injured for the loss of eight Israelis. Aftermath In Egypt there was a sense of humiliation. Not since the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war of 1948 had the Egyptians suffered such a blow.Morris, (1999) p. 283 The Israeli attack was unanimously condemned by the United Nations Security Council. In response President Nasser decided to close the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping and air traffic.

It is the largest village of upper Kurvelesh and until 1992 was the administrative center of the commune. At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Tepelen√´.Law nr. 115/2014  History  First attested in the Ottoman register of 1432, the village at that time was documented to have six houses, but the population is considered to have been larger. Progonat was part of the timar of Yusuf Bey, an Ottoman sipahi. However, in 1432 as in other regions of Albania the local population revolted under Gjergj Arianiti, while Yusuf Bey was killed during the battles. During the 17th century many families migrated from Progonat to other areas of Albania in order to avoid heavy taxation and the Islamization campaigns of the Ottoman Empire. The migrants founded the communes of Lazarat in Gjirokast√´r and Prog√´r in Devoll, while another group settled in the Albanian Riviera.Enciklopedia e Kurveleshit p.134 In 1847 the population revolted against the Ottomans and in Progonat, one of the first areas that joined the rebels the Ottoman officials were evicted. In 1854 volunteers from Progonat under Alem Toto fought against the Greek troops that had attacked the region around Ioannina. In 1878 82 volunteers under Bejo Gani as part of the Kurvelesh volunteer forces victoriously fought against another Greek landing near L√´kur√´s. In 1908 the club Arb√´ria was founded in Progonat by Shaqo Buxo and Arif Toto, local activists of the Albanian National Awakening. In 1910 the Ottoman authorities banned the organization, but it continued its activities covertly. In 1911-2 during the general revolt that led to the Albanian Declaration of Independence under Shaqo Buxo the Ottoman officials were again evicted. During the Balkan Wars the village was burnt and the population fled to the vicinity of Vlor√´. In 1916 the villagers returned to Progonat and the rebuilding of the village began. In 1920 two platoons from Progonat under Neki Daci and Musto Buxo participated in the Vlora War as part of the Kurvelesh battalion. On June 5‚Äì6 Neki Beco's platoon, which consisted of 60 volunteers took part in the capture of Tepelen√´, while Buxo's 30-man platoon at the same time attacked the Italian garrison of Kot√´. After the war eight of the platoons' soldiers were decorated for acts of bravery. In 1924 Progonat supported the overthrow of the monarchy and Fan Noli's government and volunteer platoons from the village fought in Ndroq and Kozar√´.Enciklopedia e Kurveleshit p.135 Progonat sustained heavy damages during World War II as it was burnt several times. In July 1942 the National Liberation Movement (LAN√á) council of Progonat headed by Felek Lela and Musa K√´rma was founded, followed by Communist and Anti-fascist Youth organizations. By the end of the year the village's 70-troop platoon had been also founded. The other major resistance organization founded its councils in 1943 under the leadership of Ismail Golemi. After World War II the village was rebuilt and the arable land expanded.

Reviews Distinguished critics have written about her work, such as Salvador Elizondo, Miguel √Ångel Mu√±oz, Santiago Espinosa de los Monteros, Alberto Blanco and Gonzalo Velez. According to Salvador Elizondo, art critic from Milenio newspaper, these paintings represent the point at which the movement and life balance are expressive forms and unique heritage. Sandra Pani's paintings exhibited in her exposition of 1994 (Gallery Lourdes Chumacero) presume that had surfaced since then in this artist boldly pursued the ideal of Leonardo and D√ºrer: \\"Penetrating geomentr√≠a mechanisms and in the body, but in a less categorical, freer, more lyrical.\\" She is an artist whose soul is for the moment obsessed with the body as a complex or synthesis of parts or figures that integrate pictorial poetics. They are so to speak, anatomical inventions, variations or fantasies. These paintings aspire to capture the essence of the human body, an essence that could only be formal; a yearning for the body to be soul and for the soul to be made visible by a sign. According to Miguel √Ångel Mu√±oz art critic from El Financiero newspaper, Sandra Pani belongs to a generation of artists that has considered painting as something exhausted, old fashioned and, to a certain extent, dead. It is certainly significant that Pani¬¥s abstract, semi- figurative and almost classical approach to painting should have arisen at the peak of the conceptual and minimalist movements. Still, it might be argued that its conviction springs precisely from those apparently inauspicious beginnings. Pani¬¥s works can be said to be figurative with certain poetical abstract accents. They are rooted in 20th-century painters such as Picasso, Morandi, Matisse and Giacometti, and in some modernist artists, especially North American abstract painters. In the La Jornada newspaper, Mu√±oz states that Sandra Pani's drawings at the Festival Internacional Cervantino on its 39th edition in 2011 were in effect a decantation, which runs and drips as something that falls within a long time to stay only with the essence. An almost nothing, which is the record of almost everything. An atmosphere. A sign. Santiago Espinosa de los Monteros from Casa Lamm Gallery,says that using only a few lines she describes moments in an almost Oriental style, drawing simple and almost rudimentary sketches over her two-dimensional medium in a way that bares the work - unbridling it from anything that might stop it from achieving total expression. Her work is free from the narrative temptation, which often prevents us from grasping a missing story that becomes manifest by its very absence. In her work a pendular movement can be perceived that comes and goes from abstraction to figuration, as if from one extreme to the other. It briefly stops at both ends, but does not stay at either. The work is at the road thus treaded -in a two-way fashion- by two paths that cross each other constantly and go from figure to non-figure. Between them lies emptiness transformed into an expressive possibility -having become a body, as it were- making evident something that has never been there. Alberto Blanco of the journal Artes de M√©xico describes her works as \\"painted bodies, showing all their anatomical structures, their stroke, spot, and touch of color write her story, It is precisely in the surface of Sandra Pani¬¥s paintings that the entrails of the represented body are surprisingly turned into trees and flowers, thanks to the transforming power of the poetic logic. Sandra Pani¬¥s paintings are blood that is music that is wind dreaming in the branches of the tree that is also our body.\\" Gonzalo V√©lez, also an art critic said that Sandra Pani turned her attention to the drawing, figurative structure of all plastic core. And from there, her deep study, thoughtful search of her essence, her work became a path, tracking the trace of a line in the ambiguous boundaries between drawing and painting, painting sometimes with pencil drawing and with a brush sometimes.And the route was the body. In the paintings of Sandra Pani, bodies explode and branch themselves because they accept precisely the virulent and cruel action which involves any alteration. The meaning of the metamorphosis can be seen in her work. Sandra Pani explores the liminal membrane of a series of processes that continuously generate abstract coordinated exchanges and outline for new corporeality. It remains to solve the mystery of the vacuum surrounding these vibrant apparitions.Sandra Pani shows how to embrace being and nothingness, recognized and exchanged from the heart of emptiness.

Biography  War of Africa, 1860 He was born at Madrid, the only son of Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 15th Duke of Alba. His mother Maria Francesca was the daughter of Cipriano de Palafox y Portocarrero, Duke of Pe√±aranda, and sister of Eug√©nie de Montijo, Empress of the French. During his father's lifetime he was styled Duke of Huescar. On 16 September 1860 he succeeded his mother in all her titles except the Marquisate of the Ba√±eza and the Viscountcy of Palacios de la Valduerna, and on 10 July 1881 he succeeded to all his father's titles except the Dukedom of Galisteo, which went to his sister Maria de la Asunc√≠on Rosalia, 18th Duchess of Galisteo. As a result of this inheritance the Duke of Alba was a Grandee of the first class twelve times over. As heir-male of James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick he also claimed the English title of Duke of Berwick, and used the title when staying with Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. He married Maria del Rosario, 22nd Countess of Siruela on 10 December 1877 at Madrid. She was herself a Grandee of the first class, and daughter of Manuel Pascual Luis Carl√≥s Felix Fortunato Falc√≥, Marquis of Almonazir by his wife Maria del Pilar, 3rd Duchess of Fernan Nu√±ez. His wife was born at Pau on 3 October 1854 and died at Paris on 27 March 1904. They had 3 children: * Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba * Eugenia Sol Mar√≠a del Pilar, married the Duke of Santo√±a, Lady-in- waiting of Queen Victoria Eugenia. * Hernando Fitz-James Stuart, 14th Duke of Pe√±aranda de Duero. Like his father, he was educated at the Salamanca University and the military school of Paris. He was Spanish Ambassador in Brussels between 1872 and 1878, and in Saint Petersburg until 1885. Between 1887 and 1894 he was Grand Treasurer of Spain and diplomat in Istambul. In 1895, he founded the Real Club de la Puerta de Hierro along with a group of distinguished Spanish nobles and King Alfonso XIII of Spain. The Duke of Alba was also a Senator of the Kingdom, Chamberlain to the Queen Regent Christina, and a Knight of the Golden Fleece. He died from cancer as Spanish Ambassador in the US in New York, aboard Sir Thomas Lipton's yacht, aged 51. Ancestry Titles References * George Edward Cokayne, ed.

Nicknamed Bloody Luna by the victims of her torture techniques, Brystygier was also responsible for the arrest of 2,000 Jehovah's Witnesses for their religious beliefs. The trial was a key element in the subsequent wave of repressions against the Church.

Biography Real de Az√∫a Real was born into an old Uruguayan family, the first Real de Az√∫a having arrived at the R√≠o de la Plata in 1794. He was a Catholic and, in his youth, an enthusiastic fascist and anti-liberal, an admirer of the Falange Espa√±ola (a Spanish Fascist movement that was active in 1933-34), a fan of the right- wing journalist and politician Benito Nardone (who would later become president of Uruguay in 1960-61), and an outspoken critic of Batllism (the statist and redistributionist political philosophy of Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez, president of Uruguay from 1903 to 1907 and 1911 to 1915). In his later life, Real described his early ideological journey as a beginning with ‚Äúantitotalitarianism‚Äù and then progressing to ‚Äútercerismo‚Äù (i.e. ‚Äúthirdism,‚Äù a via media between Soviet Communism and Western democratic capitalism), to ‚Äúthe left and autonomous action,‚Äù to ‚Äúthe balanced left,‚Äù and ultimately to ‚Äúadvocate for the devil of the left and Marxism.‚Äù In 1948, he began to write for Marcha, an influential leftist weekly edited by Carlos Quijano. His writings for Marcha indicated a movement from the right to the left, although he was always viewed as retaining elements of his reactionary youth.

His writings have been described as conveying a ‚Äúhorror of the void‚Äù and can be categorized variously as belonging to the genres of history, political essay, cultural criticism, and ‚Äúcriticism of customs.‚Äù His prose style was extravagant and complex, ‚Äúmade up of a slow chaos of periods that wind endlessly through the paragraph, and where the subordinates and parentheses are encapsulated within each other like Russian dolls.‚Äù One critic considers him one of the three leading members of his generation of Uruguayan writers, the other two being Rama and Monegal. His work was frequently described as ‚Äúarborescent,‚Äù which means ‚Äúresembling a tree,‚Äù but which in his case was used by critics in the sense established by Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari, namely ‚Äúto characterize thinking marked by insistence on totalizing principles, binarism, and dualism.‚Äù The critic Roberto Echavarran called him ‚Äúthe baroque historian.‚Äù Rama praised him as a first-rate example of the ‚Äúsociological imagination.‚Äù His influence on Uruguayan culture can only be compared to that of Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Carlos Quijano, Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥, and Juan E.

Early life Hegeler was born on September 13, 1835 in Bremen, then a part of the German Confederation. He was the youngest son of Herman Dietrich Hegeler and Anna Catharine (n√©e von Tungeln) Hegeler. His father, originally of Oldenburg, had traveled in the United States and wished one of his sons to settle there and chose Edward for this task. Edward's father had his education mapped out with this purpose in view, educating him in the academy of Schnepfenthal and then having him attend the Polytechnic Institute at Hanover from 1851 to 1853, and later the School of Mines at Freiberg, Saxony from 1853 to 1856. In Freiberg, Hegeler met Frederick William Matthiessen, a fellow student, who became later his partner in the zinc business. Career Hegeler and Matthiessen traveled together on the European continent, and in England, before embarking for America and landing in Boston in March 1857. While looking over the country for a suitable place to settle, they learned of Friedensville, Pennsylvania, where a zinc factory had been built, but it stood idle because the owners had not been able to manufacture the metal. Matthiessen and Hegeler, then 21 and 22 years old, respectively, stepped in, and with the same furnace succeeded in producing spelter, which at that time was pioneer work in America, for hitherto this metal had been imported from Europe. On account of the financial stringency of 1856, which still persisted in 1857, the owners of the Friedensville works refused to put more money into the enterprise, while neither Hegeler nor Matthiessen felt justified in risking their own capital, mainly because they had no confidence in the mines, which actually gave out eight years later. Having investigated conditions in Pittsburgh and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and also in southeastern Missouri, Hegeler and Matthiessen finally settled in La Salle, Illinois, because its coal fields were nearest to the ore supply at Mineral Point, Wisconsin. Here they started the Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Works on a small scale. The few employees of the original works grew in a comparatively short time, to upward of one thousand men, and the modest smelting plant developed into one of the most modernly equipped smelters in the Middle West. His success in life has been attributed to a combination of two qualities in his character: first, the thoroughness with which he investigated from all sides the minutest details of a case when he had to take a stand; and second, the insuperable persistence with which he stuck to it until he had achieved the desired result. =Open Court Publishing Company= In February 1887, Hegeler founded the Open Court Publishing Company, intended to serve the purpose of discussing religious and psychological problems on the principle that the scientific world-conception should be applied to religion. Hegeler believed in science, but he wanted to preserve the religious spirit with all its seriousness of endeavor, and in this sense he pleaded for the establishment of a religion of science. He recognized, for instance, that man with all his complicated psychical activity was a mechanism, but to him this truth was not derogatory to man, but an evidence of the great significance of machines. The mechanism of thinking is language, and so the speaking animal becomes the rational being. He maintained that through investigation and scientific criticism, religion must be purified, and the result would be a closer approach to truth on the path of progress. Hegeler rejected dualism as an unscientific and untenable view and accepted monism upon the basis of exact science, and for the discussion of the more recondite and heavier problems of science and religion he founded a quarterly, The Monist, in October 1890. Hegeler was a member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the Press Club, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Personal life He visited Germany in 1860 where, on 5 April, he married Camilla Weisbach (1835‚Äì1908), the daughter of his admired teacher, Professor Julius Weisbach, of Freiberg, Germany. In July of the same year they settled in La Salle, Illinois, where they resided until the end of their lives. They had ten children, including three daughters who died during his lifetime: * Marie Henriette Hegeler (1861‚Äì1936), who married author and editor Paul Carus. * Helene Emma Hegeler (1862‚Äì1868), who died young. * Meta Rosalie Hegeler (1865‚Äì1868), who died young. * Camilla Hegeler (1863‚Äì1955), who married physicist Alfred Bucherer. * Julius Weisbach Hegeler (1867‚Äì1943), who married Josephine Caesar (1868‚Äì1954). * Gisela Cazela Hegeler (1869‚Äì1892), who died unmarried. * Annie Hegeler (1873‚Äì1951), who married Dr. Rufus Cole, director of the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. * Herman Hegeler (1872‚Äì1913), who died unmarried. * Lena Zuleikha Hegeler (1875‚Äì1962), who married Baron Karl von Vietinghoff (1870‚Äì1923). * Olga Hegeler (1878‚Äì1956), who married Christian Bai Lihme (1866‚Äì1946), a Danish born chemist, industrialist, and art collector. In 1874, Hegeler hired noted Chicago architect William W. Boyington to design a new residence for his family. The home, today known as the Hegeler Carus Mansion, is located at 1307 Seventh Street in La Salle, Illinois. It is considered one of the Midwest's great Second Empire structures and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2007. His wife died on May 28, 1908, and Hegeler died on June 4, 1910, in La Salle. =Descendants= Through his daughter Olga, he was the grandfather of Anita Lihme (1903‚Äì1976), who became Princess Edward Joseph de Lobkowicz upon her marriage in 1926 to a son of the former Countess Palermy of Bohemia and Prince August de Lobkowicz, Privy Counselor and Lord Chamberlain to the Emperor Franz Josef. His granddaughter was the mother of Prince Edouard de Lobkowicz (1926‚Äì2010), who married Princess Marie-Fran√ßoise of Bourbon-Parma, the eldest daughter of Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma and of his wife, Madeleine de Bourbon-Busset. Through his daughter the Baroness Zuleikha Vietinghoff, he was the grandfather of Baron Karl von Vietinghoff-Scheel, who married American actress Elizabeth Allen in 1953.

He later relocated to Barcelona and shot his first film in 1914, Los Oficios de Rafael Arcos, or, The Jobs of Rafael Arcos. During World War I he traveled to the United States, where he created Elijah Press Inc., a producer of multilingual title cards. With the decline of silent films, he decided to return to Spain, where he made his debut as director with the silent film, , or The Suicide Fabricator (1928) and the sound film The Mystery of Puerta del Sol. The failure of his films forced him to return to Paris, where he made three French films for French production companies. When he once again returned to Spain, he joined the studio Orphea Barcelona, the first to shoot sound films made in Spain. There he created films like Pax (1932), Ratapl√°n (1935), and Maria de la O (1936).

His grandson Tan Chin Hian, was the chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Singapore Teochew Poit It Huay Kuan and Ngee Ann Kongsi Singapore for many years.  Early life  Tan was born Tan Yeok Nee into a Teochew family from , of the former Chaozhou Fu, China in 1827. He was later known as Tan Hiok Nee, and started his working life as a cloth peddler and in the course of his frequent visits to Wan Abu Bakar's home in Telok Blangah of Singapore, where he became a friend of the royal family. He subsequently extended his textile business to Johor Bahru where many textile shops still line Jalan Tan Hiok Nee, a road named after him, and where he used to stay. With the help of the Temenggong, Tan moved to Johor in 1853. He obtained his first surat sungai (river document) of Bukit Berangan, a tributary of the Johor River in 1853, then aged 26 in partnership with Tan Ban Tye. There, he began cultivation of pepper and gambier. This was to form the beginning of a vast holding of 9 such grants which made him the largest holder of kangchu concessions, as well as the wealthiest and most influential Chinese in Johor. A map of Johor Bahru drawn in 1887 shows Tan Hiok Nee as the owner of several lots of land in the centre of Johor Bahru where he owned many shops and houses as well as started a market on an island called Pulau Segget, midpoint of Sungai Segget. In 1854, he started develop the left bank of the Johor River. Within 5 September 1863 ‚Äì 11 September 1863, Tan Hiok Nee obtained four additional kang-chu rights within a one-week period. On 5 September 1863, he received a Surat Sungai granting him the rights to three adjacent river: Keringkim (or Kim Kim), Kong Kong and Tukang. By then, he was the most prominent businessman in Johor with seven kangchu rights. This meant controls over the entire left bank of the Johor River which spanned from the south of Kota Tinggi to Pulau Ubin.  Revenue farming and the Great Opium Syndicate  With Tan's grants, he went into pepper and gambier planting which led naturally to trading in these crops, and eventually became a major pepper and gambier trader at Boat Quay in Singapore. He held the opium and spirit farm for Johor for various periods but in 1870-79, he joined with Tan Seng Poh and Cheang Hong Lim to form the Great Opium Syndicate which managed to gain control of the opium and spirit farm not only in Johor, but also the vastly lucrative revenue farms in Singapore, Melaka, and Riau. Like Tan Kee Soon, Tan Hiok Nee was a trusted friend of Sultan Abu Bakar and with his enormous wealth, may even have been one of the Sultan's financiers.  Levers of wealth and power  In 1870, Tan was appointed as \\"Major China of Johor\\", a governmental appointment that was assisted by an assistant treasurer, a head clerk, and a head inspector. The position was apparently created specially for him since Johor at that time already had two kapitans, namely Kapitan Tan Cheng Hung in Tebrau and Kapitan Seah Tee Heng in Johor Bahru. In addition, Tan was also appointed as one of two Chinese members to the Council of State, and the first Chinese to receive the title of Dato' S.P.M.J. ( Seri Paduka Mahkota Johor Yang Amat Mulia ). However, what made him so powerful among the Chinese community in Johor was his position as the leader of the Ngee Heng Kongsi after Tan Kee Soon's death in circa 1864. By then, however, Md Salleh bin Perang had been appointed Chief of Police and the policing responsibilities that Tan Kee Soon had been entrusted with were now carried out by Johor officials. Under the circumstances, the Ngee Heng Kongsi was now more like an organisation of towkays who financed the plantations and operated the profitable revenue farms. Nevertheless, with his position as Kapitan Cina and head of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, as well as being a partner in the Great Opium Syndicate, Tan held all the levers of wealth and power available to a Chinese during his time.  Philanthropy  Tan Hiok Nee cherished Jinsha Caitang, his hometown in China, with deep feelings. He spent 14 years, starting from the ninth years of Tongzhi (1870) in the Qing period, building the \\"Congxi Ancestral Hall\\" in his hometown. Cong Xi Ancestral Hall, located in Jinsha Caitang, Chaozhou City, Guangdong Province, with its exquisite stone carving architecture, was listed in the sixth batch of protected key national cultural relics on May 25, 2006 by China's State Council. He also contributed to China during the Qing Dynastry. When China was hit by a series of serious natural disasters, he actively responded to the Qing government's disaster relief request, and contributed the largest amount of money to Shaanxi and other province famine victims. Empress Cixi therefore bestowed his \\"two bows\\" (ÊÖàÁ¶ßÂ§™ÂêéÂõ†ËÄåËµê‰ªñ‰∫åÂìÅÈ°∂Êà¥), and constructed an arch with the words \\"Zealousness for Public Interests\\" in his hometown as a memorial for Tam Hiok Nee. Hence the characters ËµÑÊîøÁ¨¨ ‚ÄúZi Zheng Di‚Äù are until today prominently displayed at his ancestral home; it gives us a sense of its occupant‚Äôs high rank. Specifically, these characters tell us that the house is the residence of a Qing Dynasty Second Ranked Official.  Retirement  In 1875, Tan inexplicably gave up his connection with Johor entirely, selling off all his concessions and withdrawing completely from Johor to settle in Singapore. It was speculated that his political rivals had removed him during the Maharaja's absence due to their resentment of his prominence and power. After his departure, Tan's assets and kang-chu rights were repossessed by the Johor government. Nevertheless, he chose his timing well for he withdrew at a time when Johor was standing at the peak of its progress under the rule of Sultan Abu Bakar. However, for the Ngee Heng, it was the beginning of the slide downhill. The administrative structure of government was well established and was managed by a core of able and experienced officers led by the much respected Dato' Jaafar bin Mohamed as Menteri Besar. Even so, he continued to have a towering presence in the Kongsi as his successor, Lim Ah Siang, was referred to only as Second Brother, the second most senior-ranking member in the secret society hierarchy. During the visit of the Royal Princes (Albert Victor and George) to Johore in 1882, Tan Yoek Nee was a member of the Entertainment committee. Tan Hiok Nee lived on Coleman Street at the Hotel de la Paix after he left Johore and in 1885 he proceeded to built himself a magnificent mansion in Singapore at the corner of Tank Street. He sold off this house in Singapore due to the noise of the nearby railway, and eventually returned to China to become one of the few migrants who made good overseas and returned to end his days in his native village. He passed away on 21 May 1902 at the age of 75. Descendants Tan had five sons. His second son, Chen Ding Xing, was a government official in China‚Äôs Jiang Xi province. All his sons passed away before him. Tan‚Äôs eight grandsons ‚Äì including Tan Chin Boon, Tan Chin Teat, Tan Chin Yeow and Tan Chin Hean ‚Äì inherited his properties and were well known within the Teochew community in Singapore. Tan Chin Hean was a prominent elite of society who served as Vice-Chairman of the Ngee Ann Kongsi, President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and headed the Teochew Huay Kuan.

The game is played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards or naipes that are very similar to the Italian 40-card deck. Most of Tute variants have very similar rules to normal tute. This variations are different by the number of deck cards used or variations in the standard rules.  Havanian Tute  At the start of the hand both players receive eight cards, the trump is placed in the same way as normal Tute. This Havanian of Tute is a two player variant. After the deal, each player receives eight cards. The trump is placed the same way as in two- player normal tute. Like in normal tute after each play, the winning player after placing in the baza the two cards, will take from the deck a card and the loser the next one. The worth of cards is the same. The players can't chant tute and the rest of Canticles can be made any moment of the hand (except when only two cards left in the deck). If the player has a seven of the trump suit, and the card is bigger, this card can be exchanged with the seven. The player that earn 100+ wins the game. Players can chant capoteCapote rule, Havanian Tute when the same player gets the last eight tricks of the hand, when a player chants capote the points earned by both doesn't count and the rest of the game depends of the player to get the 8 tricks if the player doesn't reach the 8 tricks the opponent wins the game.  Draged Tute  The Draged Tute is a three player variant, each one receives 13 cards. The last card, after the deal is done is turned face up, as in normal tute, turning in to the trump suit. The Game rules of Normal Tute stand, including the canticles. After the final counting, the player that won more points earns 100 chips from each opponent. If the player has 100 points or fewer; 200 chips from each opponent. During the play, the player that chants the 40, earns 40 chips. For chanting the 20, earns 20 chips.  Tute Cabr√≥n  The Tute Cabrero or Tute Cabr√≥n is a variant for three to four players; each one receives ten cards. There is no trump until a situation of the game. The Tute Cabrebrero is very similar to the Tute in Pairs the difference between the two is that there is not a single winner in every deal, there is only one loser, this is the player with an intermediate position in the hand. When in the same hand a Knight and a King are played the player that wins the hand can make the canticle and the trump will be established after the play and the player will get 40 points. If this situation happen again the player will chant 20. When the game finishes the winners will be the player with the biggest score and the lowest score, intermediate scores or players with the same scores will be the losers.[ Tute Variants Rules at Pagat.com] = Martinez Tute Cabron = Martinez Tute Cabron is an improvement to the tute cabron. In this variant have been introduced some modifications coming from the bridge game and from Calahorra Tute Cabron. This variant is played in Bahrain and other Arab countries. The Martinez Tute cabron has these particularities: # If one player does not do any point, he loses. # If one player is over 110 points, he loses. # At the first winning round of a player, if the winner says \\"I go for you\\" that means he plays to be high, if he gets more than 120 points he wins and the other two lose, if he loses then he loses two. # During all the game a player is allowed to claim any tute, always after winning the round. # During all the game a player is allowed to claim any tute cabron, always after winning the round. Tute cabron means that the player has the 4 Kings or the 4 Queens. He has to scream: TUTE CABRON!!! # The game is played in three rubbers. Each rubber is completed when one of the players gets three losses. # At the end of the last rubber, the third, it is necessary to determinate the winner. This process is done in this way: ## First we count how many rubber each player has won, win a rubber means having the fewest losses. ## If there is a draft, then we count the number of rubbers each player has lost, loss of a rubber means having three losses. ## If there is a draft, then we count the total number of losses. The player with fewest losses wins the game. ## If there is still a draft, then it will be necessary to check who has the longest \\"card\\". #The person who starts the first rubber chooses the direction to go in... ## The loser of each rubber gets to start the first game on the next rubber... ## Subsequently, the loser of each rubber chooses the direction to go in...  Auction Tute  The Auctioned Tute is played by 3 players or 4 in a special variant, using 36 cards of the deck (all the kings are retired from the deck before starting).36 cards on Auctioned Tute At the start of each round all cards are delivered to the three players, no trump is established at the deal time as in other kinds of tute. = Three Player Game = In each round of the game one of the players competes against the other two, beating the number of points he thinks he can win with his cards (auction). At the time the auction ends, the player chooses the trump suit and tries winning as minimum the mount he estimated. At the end of the round the points of the beating player are counted, if it reaches the estimate number or wins more point, he wins the round. If he fails, the other players win even if their score is lower. During the game the canticles are the same (not including Tute), the only difference is that only the player that beats is the only one that can do it. The beating player also can claim the ten points if he wins last cards showdown. = Four Player Game Variation = The game is very similar to three player one, but each round one of the players stands out of the game. After the deal and auction, turns into the game moderator, taking and watching the cards of the player who has won the auction, and optionally increasing the amount of the bet in ten points. The auction stands in the same way as normal auctioned tute rules. When the moderator passes, the cards are returned to the player who won the bet. If the moderator increases the beat, the cards remain in his hands, and the other player gets out the deal.Tute Subastado, Four Players Variant The next rounds follow the same rules. = Auction Rules = * The beat starts with the player that deals. * The beat has to be a multiple of five. * The minimum beat is 60 points, if he wins, in the next round others have to pass that score. * If none of the players reaches 60 points, the round doesn't start.  Win-Loss Tute  = Three player game = The game is played with 36 cards of Spanish deck, all the cards are deal to the three players. No trumps are established at the begin. The Rules of Normal tute stand, the main objective of the game is to win most points, or less points. The player that stands in the middle losses the round. The game continues until a player has lost six times, being the overall loser. After a player makes the first canticle, he obtains 40 points and the cards of the suit of that King and Knight turn in the trump. = Four to Five Player Game = The game is played with 40 cards of Spanish deck, all the cards are deal to players, last card dealt is the trump. Rules of normal tute stand during the play. The objective is to win less points as possible, the player with most points lose unless he has 101 or more points. If there is a tie in points and one of the tied players wins the last trick losses the round. If no one of the tied players took the last trick, the player that is sitting to the right of the one who took the last trick losses.  Moroccan Tute  In Morocco, the game is known as Tuti. The vocabulary of the game is of Spanish origins (shbada for espada, cobas for copas etc..). It is played in pairs, with the same scoring system as in Spain.  American Tute  The game is played by 2 players. Eight cards are dealt to each one. Rules of normal tute stand, tute canticle is not valid. The first player that earns 121 or more points wins the game.  Puerto Rican Tute  The game is played by 2 or 4 players, following same rules of Spain's Tute, but you have to win a trick before you can 'acusar' (declare) the 20s or 40s, or before you can exchange your 7 trump card for any points card that is the trump at the bottom of the pile, or exchange your 2 trump card for any card 7 and lower that is the trump at the bottom of the pile. You also get a chance to exchange your 7 or 2 card before any of the players start playing, so this brief moment is usually allowed by the other players.

They grow on trees (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes), where they either hang down or form creeping or upright shrubs. Their flowers open in the day and remain open at night; they may be either radially symmetrical (regular) or bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). The fruits are berry-like, fleshy with smallish seeds. They are found mainly in the east of South America, with a centre of diversity in Bolivia, but some species occur in Central America and North America; one species, Rhipsalis baccifera, also occurs in the Old World. Taxonomy Cacti belonging to the Rhipsalidae are quite distinct in appearance and habit from other cacti, growing on trees or rocks as epiphytes or lithophytes, and are thus easily distinguished. However, for many years there has been confusion as to how to divide the tribe into genera. For example, in 1858 Charles Lemaire recognized the distinctiveness of the species then called Epiphyllum russellianum by creating the genus Schlumbergera. However he kept the only other species of Schlumbergera known at the time in a different genus. As another example, in 1923, Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Rose created the genus Hatiora. Of the species known at the time, they placed two in Hatiora (H. salicornioides and H. cylindrica); they left H. gaertneri in Schlumbergera where they had placed it in 1913, and they placed H. rosea in a new genus, Rhipsalidopsis. According to Anderson, the confusion among the Rhipsalideae was not clarified until work by Wilhelm Barthlott and Nigel Taylor in 1995. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have led to a slight modification of the approach taken by Barthlott and Taylor, since with their circumscriptions, Hatiora and Schlumbergera were not monophyletic. One hypothesis for the relationships between the genera is shown below. The yellow shading shows species formerly placed in Hatiora, but which were moved by Calvente et al. to a more broadly defined Schlumbergera. An alternative approach uses the genus Rhipsalidopsis for the two species Schlumbergera rosea and Schlumbergera gaertneri, which are treated as Rhipsalidopsis gaertneri and Rhipsalidopsis rosea. =Genera= The genera included in the tribe are as follows, with species counts based on Plants of the World Online: * Hatiora Britton & Rose ‚Äì 3 species; synonyms include Epiphyllopsis, Hariota DC non Andan., Rhipsalidopsis and Pseudozygocactus; it has been included in Rhipsalis * Lepismium Pfeiff. ‚Äì 6 species; synonyms include Acanthorhipsalis, Lymanbensonia, Pfeiffera; it has been included in Rhipsalis * Rhipsalis Gaertn. ‚Äì 43 species; synonyms include Erythrorhipsalis; most species in the tribe have been placed here at one time or another * Schlumbergera Lem. ‚Äì 9 species; synonyms include Epiphyllanthus, Epiphyllum Pfeiffer non.

Set among the Litchfield Hills of the lower Berkshires, the Festival traces its roots to the Battell family who started hosting summer concerts on the Norfolk town green in the 1880s. Now under the auspices of the Yale University School of Music, the Festival hosts more than 30 concerts each summer featuring professional performers and graduate music students from around the globe. Among many others, guest performers and composers over the years have included the Tokyo String Quartet, Percy Grainger, Fritz Kreisler, Midori, Pinchas Zukerman, Dave Brubeck, Jean Sibelius, Nicholas Laucella and Sergei Rachmaninoff. The Norfolk Festival has played an elemental role in the cultivation and development of classical music in America. Today, with its history and setting, it continues to provide the New England experience with an offering of chamber music. History Robbins Battell (1819‚Äì1895), the seventh son of a wealthy Norfolk, CT family, was a generous patron of music as well as a skilled amateur flutist and composer. After graduating from Yale University in 1839, he returned to Norfolk to manage the family business enterprises. This reached New York City and beyond and generated a vast wealth that allowed him to become an important philanthropist. Passionate about the musical life of the community, he created a singing school and conducted concerts of the Litchfield County Musical Association in Norfolk and neighboring Winsted. He conducted a performance of the Hallelujah Chorus to celebrate the centennial of the county in 1851. As a composer, he wrote hymns and choral arrangements, and set a great deal of poetry to music. Robbins was also concerned about the economy of his home town. To attract visitors and tourists, he built a hotel and, beginning in the 1880s, financed a week-long series of concerts on the green. This concert series became what is now known as the Norfolk Festival. Robbins‚Äô daughter, Ellen (1851‚Äì1939), continued her father‚Äôs legacy of bringing music to Norfolk. In 1895 she married Carl Stoeckel (1858‚Äì1925), son of Gustave Stoeckel, who was awarded the first Doctor of Music degree at Yale. After their marriage, in memory of Ellen‚Äôs father, Robbins, Carl and Ellen started the Litchfield County Choral Union which continues to perform at the Norfolk Festival to this day. Under Carl and Ellen, Norfolk soon became the first internationally known classical music festival in America. The Stoeckels assumed the entire expense of the concerts which took place on their estate. These concerts rapidly became extravagant affairs with parties and picnics and were among the most popular summer social events in New England. They recruited a 70-piece orchestra of musicians from the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera, and paid for a special train to transport the instrumentalists to the Litchfield Hills. In 1906, to accommodate the ever-growing crowds at the Festival, the couple built a concert hall known, then as now, as the Music Shed. Carl and Ellen Stoeckel‚Äôs philanthropy extended to presenting the festivals and concerts free of charge. They sought no public recognition for their role; Ellen listened to the concerts from a secluded window above the Music Shed stage while Carl quietly entered from the side and stood in the doorway. They commissioned new works from many of the leading composers of their time and invited them to conduct their own premieres. Sibelius, for example, composed his tone poem The Oceanides for the Stoeckels and conducted it in the Music Shed during his only trip to the United States on June 4, 1915. The autograph manuscript is now in the Music Library at Yale University. The Yale School of Music in Norfolk When Ellen Battell Stoeckel died in 1939 with no surviving children, she stipulated in her will that her estate was to be used in perpetuity for the ‚Äúbenefit and development of the School of Music of Yale University and for extending said University‚Äôs courses in music, art, and literature.‚Äù The Yale Summer School of Music was established in 1941. Since that time, the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival has played host to thousands of emerging young professional musicians. Today the Festival offers intensive tuition-free programs each summer to approximately eighty students in chamber music, new music and choral repertoire. The Music Shed Exterior of the music shed Designed by New York architect, E.K. Rossiter, the Music Shed existed first as a separate prototype structure modeled after Steinway Hall in New York. A test concert was given in 1904. The success of the experimental hall led to the construction of the Music Shed which was built for the Litchfield County Choral Union and opened in 1906. The Shed had to be enlarged due to the number of chorus and audience members and, after an expansion in 1910, it could accommodate a chorus of 425 and an audience of 1,500. The Shed is built of cedar and lined with redwood that was hand-picked and imported from California. The building‚Äôs extraordinary acoustics, not to mention the exquisite glow of its interior can be attributed to the redwood. Initially tickets were sold, but the Stoeckels eventually decided that events in the Music Shed would be by invitation only. Movie stars, politicians, high society and professional musicians began to covet invitations from the prestigious Battells. By the beginning of the first world war, the Music Shed was one of the country‚Äôs most sought-out venues and a premier concert hall in New England.

During the War of 1812, Graves served as a major in the 2nd Battalion, 5th Kentucky Volunteer regiment. Together with other officers, he commanded Kentucky troops in the Battle of Frenchtown (also known as the Battle of the River Raisin) on January 22, 1813, in Michigan Territory. This was part of an effort by Americans to take the British-controlled fort at Detroit, Fort Shelby. This battle had the highest number of American fatalities in the war: of 1,000 American troops, nearly 400 were killed in the conflict, and 547 were taken prisoner. The next day an estimated 30-100 Americans were killed by Native Americans after having surrendered. Graves was among the Americans known to be taken by the Potawatomi on a forced march to the British fort at Detroit, Michigan. He is believed to have died on the march, as he disappeared from the historic record. Because so many men of the Kentucky elite were lost in the Battle of Frenchtown, it has been commemorated in the state. Graves is included among the officers memorialized on Kentucky's Military Monument to All Wars in the state capital of Frankfort and Kentucky's Graves County was named in his honor.  Personal life and politics Graves was born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia in 1771. After the American Revolutionary War, he moved in 1791 to frontier Kentucky with his widowed mother and siblings. They settled in Fayette County, where Graves was elected to two terms (1801 and again in 1804) as a state representative. This was in the central Bluegrass region, one of the first areas of the state to be settled by European Americans. He married Polly Dudley, daughter of Ambrose Dudley and Ann (Parker) Dudley. Together they had six children.  Military career and presumed death  During the War of 1812, Graves served under Colonel William Lewis as major in the 2nd Battalion, 5th Kentucky Volunteer regiment. He was the commanding officer of Nathaniel G. S. Hart. In the fall of 1812 nearly one thousand Kentucky troops were sent to Michigan Territory in an American effort to take Fort Detroit, which was under the control of the British. On January 18, they defeated British and Native American forces at Frenchtown, south of Detroit. The British forces were led by Colonel Henry Proctor. At the second Battle of Frenchtown on January 22, 1813, the British and Native Americans ambushed the American troops. During the melee Graves was shot in the knee. He bandaged his wound himself and told his men to continue fighting. After the death of Colonel John Allen,Battle of the Thames, Page 21 Graves and Major George Madison had to take field command of the Americans.Madison was a 2nd-cousin of President Madison and after the war was elected Governor of Kentucky. (See \\"The Kentucky Encyclopedia\\", page 601.) Nearly 400 Americans were killed during the battle, the highest number of fatalities in any single battle of the war, and 547 were taken prisoner at surrender. Upon General James Winchester's orders, Graves and hundreds of other survivors surrendered to British forces. His younger brother, Lieutenant Thomas Coleman Graves (a 1st Lieutenant of the 17th Infantry), was killed during the battle. After the surrender, British officer Captain William Elliott, a Loyalist, asked to borrow Graves' horse, saddle and bridle. Elliott promised that he would send back additional help for the wounded Americans but the help never arrived. Proctor moved his forces north in retreat, with a group of the most fit prisoners, in order to evade any American forces arriving from the south. The remaining prisoners were left in Frenchtown. The next day, on January 23, the Potawatomi killed many of the wounded prisoners during what became known as the River Raisin Massacre. Graves, Timothy Mallory, Samuel Ganoe, and John Davenport, were all held as prisoners, with Mallory and Ganoe later escaping. The next day Graves was among the prisoners marched to Detroit despite their wounds, but his name subsequently disappears from written records.Richardson/Dudley, Page 29 Graves was reportedly seen near Detroit on the River Rouge. But as he was not definitively heard from again, he is presumed to have died during the march. The Potawatomi were known to have killed prisoners who could not keep up on such forced marches.Young, Battle of the Thames, Page 26 Other Americans also died on the forced march to Fort Malden in Ontario. General Winchester wrote a February 11, 1813, letter about the battle to the US Secretary of War, which was widely published in American newspapers at that time. He mentioned Major Graves and his fellow officers, saying \\"they defended themselves to the last with great gallantry\\". After Graves' disappearance while a prisoner, for years \\"his widow kept a light burning at the window of their home\\", in case he would return.  Memorials  Frenchtown (Kentucky War Memorial Frankfort, KY) Graves County, Kentucky was created and named in his honor in 1823. Graves' name is inscribed, along with the names of his fellow officers who fell at the Raisin, on Kentucky's Military Monument to All Wars in the Frankfort Cemetery in the state capital. The area of the battlefield was established as River Raisin National Battlefield Park, the only National Battlefield Park to commemorate a battle of the War of 1812.

Her husband also does not say anything to his mother because he thinks that since he is her only son, people will disrespect him and his wife if he takes his wife's side. So Sakhu has to bear all the ill-treatment silently. She worships Vitthala with all her heart and forgets her daily sufferings. One day, her husband's sister returns from her home with her daughter. She tells her mother how she was beaten by her mother-in-law and her husband and how they threw her out of the house. Her mother tells her to live in her home with his brother. She also starts troubling Sakhu, because she envies how his brother loves her. One day, Sakhu's husband falls ill and Sakhu defies her mother-in-law's order and comforts her husband rather than doing her prescribed work. Sakhu's mother-in-law tells her son that he has to choose between his mother and her; he chooses his mother and throws Sakhu out of the house. A sad Sakhu sees a group of Vitthala devotees doing Naam-Kirtan. She joins the group and starts doing Naam-Kirtan. Her husband's sister finds her and tells her mother about that. The mother-in-law arrives and drags her to her home and ties her to a pole. Sakhu starts crying and worships Vitthala and after some time, things take a different turn. The movie ends with two Sakhus. People get dumbfounded by seeing two Sakhus and start thinking that she is a ghost. The movie ends by clearing everyone's doubts.

Following the foundation of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) in 1955 a training school for airborne troops was established at Altenstadt Air Base in 1956. In June 1993, the base was officially named Franz Josef Strauss Barracks after the former prime minister of Bavaria, who had served on the air base during World War II as an \\"officer for military spiritual guidance\\" (Offizier f√ºr wehrgeistige F√ºhrung).

The Central Medical Services will be expanded into a regional medical centre. Additionally, a battalion of aspirant non-commissioned officers will be based at Altenstadt Air Base.

Family  Baroness Amalia von Dyhrn was born into the Prussian noble family of Rabenau. Her father Baron Friedrich George von Rabenau, a tax officer and a former major in the army, was an impoverished aristocrat, who owned a bankrupted estate in Schwiebus. Her mother Johanna ‚ÄúJeanette‚Äù von Schlichting was an illegitimate daughter of the Prussian general Baron Samuel von Schlichting; because of her opportunistic and promiscuous nature she had a quite bad reputation in the society. Amalia's parents were divorced in 1791. She moved with her mother and her older sister Henrietta to Breslau, where they lived very modestly in a small apartment at a monastery. In 1794 her father Friedrich committed suicide and Amalia never got to know him.  Early life  Amalia was known as a beautiful, dark-haired and black-eyed young lady, whose origin is actually still not quite clear. Especially because of her looks, the rumors were circling around, that she was a product of her mother's affair with a Gipsy from a South-European country. These rumors were however never confirmed as truth. As an impecunious divorc√©e Jeanette von Schlichting, who was a close relative of the Lichnowsky princely family, had to take care of herself and her two daughters. She established a small private tailor school for noble ladies in Breslau and her older daughter Henrietta, who was old enough to work, was sent to the estate of the Counts von Schweinitz-Krain in Niebusch (county of Freystadt in Schlesien), where she worked as a governess of the young Countess Johanna von Schweinitz-Krain, who was a granddaughter of Baroness Helene von Dyhrn (n√©e Countess von Schweinitz). Henrietta stayed unmarried. In 1810 Amalia and her mother attended a high society ball at the family von Berge-Herrndorf's house in Breslau. There she met the young Baron Julius von Dyhrn, with whom she was officially engaged two years later. The Dyhrn family strongly disapproved of this union, because of the bride's trivial background and her low economic status, but Julius was determined to marry the woman he fell in love with. They married in April 1814 in Freystadt. Her mother Jeanette was overjoyed, especially because this marriage meant the end of her family's financial problems.  Later life  After the marriage Amalia, now a Baroness von Dyhrn moved to the Dyhrn family's mansion in Herzogswaldau together with her mother and her older sister. Amalia's mother- in-law Baroness Caroline von Dyhrn (n√©e Baroness von Berge), who was actually a stepmother of Julius, was so disappointed with her stepson's choice, that she decided to leave the family residence and move alone to her house in Freystadt. In 1825 Julius took the name von Dyhrn-Czettritz und Neuhaus of his uncle Ernest Carl von Dyhrn-Czettritz-Neuhaus, who had no children, and inherited his fortune and his large properties in Waldenburg. Amalia and Julius moved to their manor house in Neuhaus (county of Waldenburg), leaving Herzogswaldau to Julius‚Äô younger brother Heinrich von Dyhrn. The couple had no children, but their marriage was said to be a very happy one. It was only a few years before Julius‚Äô death, when the things got bad. The Baron lost his reason and was transmitted to a psychiatric institution. A few years earlier Amalia, born and married into Protestant families, converted in Catholicism and began a close friendship with a catholic priest from Herzogswaldau, named Franz Gyrdt. After her husband Julius died in 1841, the priest moved to the new-build mansion of the Dyhrn family in Hermsdorf. Amalia inherited this mansion and all the properties and buildings, that previously belonged to her husband. She was also very successful in leading the Dyhrn family mining business. The estate, which Amalia von Dyhrn inherited, was enormous; estimated to be 10 million Prussian thalers (nowadays approx. 165 million US dollars). It was because of this princely wealth that people very often referred to her as ¬ªPrincess¬´ instead of ¬ªBaroness¬´. The Dyhrn mansion in Hermsdorf was rebuilt in an orphanage in the 1870s Although she had no children, Amalia and Julius took care of two of their closest relatives. Since 1822 their nephew Alfred von Dyhrn was living at their mansion in Hermsdorf, and later Amalia also took care of her niece Baroness Anette von Dyhrn.  Dyhrn family versus Catholic Church  The priest Franz Gyrdt became the closest friend of the Baroness and was also the administrator of her finances. He was encouraging her to make several donations for Catholic Church and for catholic institutions in the province of Silesia. Amalia, as a humanitarian person, made numerous donations also for poor and less fortunate people during her life. Franz Gyrdt had a very big influence on the Baroness; it was probably because of him that the Baroness von Dyhrn converted to Catholicism. In the middle of the 1860s she got very ill and in June 1866 she died. Surprisingly, the principal heir of her fortune was her longtime friend and advisor Gyrdt. Her closest relatives ‚Äìthe Dyhrns from Herzogswaldau, were extremely unpleasantly surprised by the content of Amalia's testament. The part of the Dyhrn family fortune, estimated to something more than 12 million thaler (nowadays approx. 200 million US dollars), which at the time was in Amalia's hands, was being inherited by a person who was not even a member of the family and who was actually catholic. She left more than 9 million thaler (nowadays approx. 149 million US dollars) to Gyrdt, only 1,5 million thaler to her niece Anette (married to Count Heinrich Wilhelm von Dyhrn from the Dolzig estate), half of a million thaler to her nephew Alfred and the rest to charities in Breslau and for rebuilding of her mansion in Hermsdorf into an orphanage. She also left some of her money to her loyal longtime servants ‚Äì especially appreciated was her personal maid and companion Clara J√§schke. The Dyhrn family was not prepared to give up the fortune. But after more than 10 years of lawsuits between the family and Gyrdt nothing could be done in favor of the family, because the will was constructed perfectly, allowing neither a refutation nor the right for jurisdiction of the government. The Dyhrn family, who was always convinced, that the priest either forged the testament or forced Amalia to appoint him the main heir of the family fortune, was powerless. Even the Emperor Wilhelm himself could not help them. After Franz Gyrdt received his share of the assets, his lifestyle changed dramatically. He bought new properties, traveled a lot and he also gave up working as a priest. After Gyrdt's death the fortune of this Protestant family was inherited by the Diocese of Breslau (elevated to Archdiocese in 1930) and was being administrated by the Prince-Bishop of Breslau dr. Heinrich F√∂rster, who already in 1866 also directly inherited a share from Amalia von Dyhrn's estate, and by dr. Adolph Franz. When dr. Franz was leading the German Catholic newspaper Germania, this was also being, among many other Catholic institutions, financially supported by the Protestant Dyhrn family's fortune. The story was mentioned in several European newspapers, being one of the biggest scandals in the German Catholic Church in the 19th Century.

As of 2011 it was 70% owned by Anvil Mining and 30% by the state-owned G√©camines. The mine was placed on care and maintenance in late 2008. Background The Mutoshi Mine is an old open pit copper mine on the Kolwezi Klippe in the west of the Congo Copperbelt. It is a reduced facies type copper deposit made up of two ore beds separated by a layer of siliceous dolomite. The mine was first opened in 1903, and was initially worked for gold. Between 1960 and 1987 a washing plant at the mine discharged mineralized material into the Kulumaziba watercourse. Samples of the first of the deposit indicated a resource of about 102,000 tonnes of contained copper. Tailings operation In November 2004, Anvil Mining agreed to pay US$12.5 million for a 70% interest in the Mutoshi copper-cobalt project from the state-owned G√©camines and the private DRC company Emiko. The property included the old Mutoshi mine, the Kulumaziba coarse rejects/tailings deposit, the Mutoshi Northwest deposit, the Nioka deposit, the Kamukonko cobalt prospect, and prospective ground on the Kolwezi Klippe. In October 2005 the Economist Intelligence Unit reported that Anvil's claim to Mutoshi was being disputed by Chemaf, an Indian-based company that operates the Etoile copper and cobalt mine. Chemaf, which apparently had strong political connections in the DRC, claimed it acquired the rights to Mutoshi in a 2003 deal with Emiko. The case was seen as an important test of the Mining Code's guarantee that the courts will uphold property rights. In late 2005, Anvil started mining the tailings, at first with good results. However, the company faced competition with artisanal miners on the property, and heavy rainfall had the effect of washing the more valuable coarser-grained tailings downstream, leaving less valuable fine- grained tailings. With increasingly poor results, operations were halted at the end of 2008. Future potential In 2009, Anvil completed a scoping study for phasing out the existing Heavy Media Separation (HMS) operation and replacing it with SX-EW processing of oxide open pit mine feed, processing copper and cobalt deposits around the old Mutoshi mine. Further drilling and testing were needed before the feasibility could be confirmed.

Early life Shani Rhys James was born in 1953 in Melbourne, Australia, the daughter of a Welsh father and an Australian mother and came to the UK as a child. At six years old Rhys James was ill with thrombocytopenia. She describes this time spent out of school as being significant for allowing her time to play and enter a state of child-like games and develop her imagination during these important early years. Growing up in Australia during her early years was by her own admission a particular contributing factor from her childhood to her decision to make art a career. Her mother told her not to go to art school as the best artists she knew didn't attend. She was however encouraged by staying with Charles Blackman as well as having artist friends during childhood. Theatre was also a large influence as Rhys James's mother was an actress. Constant production of scenery, props and theatre costumes as well as rehearsal of parts all formed part of the environment that surrounded her during childhood. Early education took place in Eltham, Australia from 5 to 9 years of age then Parliament Hill Girls School, London. Education and career Rhys James studied at Loughborough College of Art and Design and in 1976 obtained a degree in Fine Art at Saint Martin's School of Art, in London.

She was born and raised in a sharecropping family in the Jim Crow era Southern United States. Taylor's refusal to remain silent about a brutal rape she suffered, perpetrated by white men, led to organizing in the African-American community on behalf of justice and civil rights. On September 3, 1944, Taylor was kidnapped while leaving church and gang-raped by six white men. Despite the men's confessions to authorities, two grand juries subsequently declined to indict the men; no charges were ever brought against her assailants. In 2011, the Alabama Legislature officially apologized on behalf of the state, \\"for its failure to prosecute her attackers.\\" Taylor's rape, refusal to remain silent, and the subsequent court cases were among the early instances of nationwide protest and activism among the African-American community, and ended up providing an organizational spark in the civil rights movement. At the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, while accepting the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, Oprah Winfrey discussed and brought awareness to Taylor's story. The Congressional Black Caucus led Democratic Caucus members in wearing red \\"Recy\\" pins while attending the 2018 State of the Union, where Taylor's granddaughter, Mary Joyce Owens, was a guest. Early life Recy Corbitt was born on December 31, 1919 in rural Alabama, where her family were farmworkers doing sharecropping. At 17, her mother died and she cared for her six siblings. She continued to work in sharecropping and by the time she was 24 in 1944, she had married Willie Guy Taylor and they had a young daughter, Joyce Lee. Assault Recy Taylor was walking home from church on September 3, 1944, with her friend Fannie Daniel and Daniel's teenage son West, when a car pulled up behind them on the road. In the car were US Army Private Herbert Lovett and six other men, all armed. Herbert Lovett accused Taylor of cutting Tommy Clarson \\"that white boy in Clopton this evening.\\" This accusation was false, as Taylor had been with Daniel all day. The seven men forced Taylor into the car at gunpoint and proceeded to drive her to a patch of trees on the side of the road. They forced her to remove her clothes saying \\"Get them rags off, or I'll kill you and leave you down here in the woods.\\" After she was forcibly undressed, Taylor begged to return home to her family, including her husband and an infant child. The assailants ignored her requests, all removed their clothes, and watched as Lovett ordered Taylor to lie down and for her to \\"act just like you do with your husband or I'll cut your damn throat.\\" She was raped by six of the men, including Lovett. Reactions to the assault Taylor's kidnapping was reported immediately to the police by Daniel. Daniel identified the car as belonging to Hugo Wilson, who admitted to picking up Taylor and, as he put it, \\"carrying her to the spot\\" and pinned the rape on six men, Dillard York, Billy Howerton, Herbert Lovett, Luther Lee, Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble. Even though three eyewitnesses identified Wilson as the driver of the car, the police did not call in any of the men Wilson named as assailants, and Wilson was fined $250 (). The black community of Abbeville was outraged at the actions taken by the police, and the event was reported to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Montgomery, Alabama. The NAACP sent down their best investigator and activist against sexual assaults on black women, Rosa Parks.\\"Southern black women find justice elusive for civil rights-era rapes\\". Associated Press, October 15, 2010. In early October, the Chicago Defender, which had a national African-American audience, ran a front-page article entitled \\"Victim of White Alabama Rapists\\", which profiled Taylor and the case. First grand jury  Parks took the case back to Montgomery where she started to form support for Taylor with the assistance of E.D. Nixon, Rufas A. Lewis, and E.G. Jackson, all influential men in the Montgomery community. Parks and her allies formed the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Taylor, \\"with support from national labor unions, African-American organizations, and women's groups.\\" The group recruited supporters across the entire country and by the spring of 1945 they had organized what the Chicago Defender called the \\"strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade.\\" The grand jury hearing took place on October 3‚Äì4, 1944, with an all-white, all-male jury. However, none of the assailants had been arrested, which meant that the only witnesses were Taylor's black friends and family. Taylor's family could not identify the names of the assailants, and since Sheriff Gamble \\"never arranged a police line-up, Taylor could not identify her attackers in court\\". Also, the $250 bond Gamble placed Wilson and his accomplices under \\"were issued late in the afternoon, the day after Taylor's hearing\\". After five minutes of deliberation, the jury dismissed the case. The only way it could be re-opened would be through an indictment from a second grand jury. Violent intimidation In the months following the trial, Taylor received multiple death threats, and her home was firebombed. Taylor, along with her husband and child, moved into the family home, where her father and siblings would help protect Taylor from other death threats. Her entire family was afraid to go out after dark, and Taylor would not leave even during the day. She not only feared the threats from the angry vigilantes of the town, but also the threats from her attackers the night of the assault. Benny Corbitt took guard in a tree every night with a gun guarding Taylor and her family until daybreak. Taylor and her family assumed they would live the rest of their lives in fear. However, talk of \\"the brutal rape and phony hearing\\" resonated through NAACP chapters throughout the south and within black communities. These organizations and others came together to defend Taylor and demand punishment for her attackers as well as Taylor's safety. Activism for justice The activists convened at the Negro Masonic Temple in Birmingham, Alabama, where members of the Montgomery and Birmingham NAACP, editors and reporters from the Alabama Tribune and Birmingham World, and members of the Southern Negro Youth Congress, or SNYC, amongst others coordinated efforts to bring justice for Recy Taylor. SNYC members, together with Rosa Parks and other primarily female activists helped spread Recy Taylor's story all the way up the coast to Harlem, New York. Stories of Taylor's assault were printed in the Pittsburgh Courier making the \\"rape of Recy Taylor a southern injustice\\" which \\"immediately sparked nation-wide interest.\\" This led to a publication in the New York Daily News titled \\"Alabama Authorities Ignore White Gang's Rape of Negro Mother\\" and attacked the long lasting segregation and defense of white womanhood as well as the \\"manipulation of interracial rape to justify violence against black men.\\" After various other newspaper publications and widespread knowledge of the attack, black activists started writing to the Governor of Alabama, Chauncey Sparks. Sparks had promised during his election campaign to, \\"keep the federal government's nose out of Alabama business\\", so after numerous attacks, including comparisons of the Henry County's police to the Nazis, \\"Governor Sparks reluctantly agreed to launch an investigation.\\" Rosa Parks, in her instrumental work to bring justice for Taylor, spearheaded the creation of the \\"Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor\\" (CEJRT). It quickly gathered national support, with local chapters springing up across the United States. The group had an illustrious membership; \\"luminaries included W.E.B. Du Bois; Mary Church Terrell, a suffragist and founder of the National Association of Colored Women; Charlotte Hawkins Brown, a popular clubwoman and respected educator; Ira De A. Reid, a sociologist and assistant director of the newly formed Southern Regional Council; John Sengstacke, the publisher of the Chicago Defender; Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes of Harlem Renaissance fame; Lillian Smith, author of the controversial interracial love story Strange Fruit; and Broadway impresario Oscar Hammerstein II.\\" The \\"illustrious\\" group drew the attention of the FBI, as the House Un-American Activities Committee argued that the group was simply a cover for the Communist Party. Investigation After Governor Sparks launched an investigation, Sheriff Gamble was interviewed again about the measures he took to ensure justice on the behalf of Taylor. Gamble falsely claimed that he started an investigation of his own immediately after the attack. He also claimed that he had arrested all of the men involved in the rape two days after the assault, and that he had placed Hugo Wilson, the man identified as being the owner of the car, under a $500 bond. He also accused Taylor of being \\"nothing but a whore around Abbeville\\" and that she had been \\"treated for some time by the Health Officer of Henry County for venereal disease.\\" Later, other white men from Abbeville identified Taylor as an \\"upstanding, respectable woman who abided by the town's racial and sexual mores\\". Investigators interviewed the rapists, and four of the seven men \\"admitted to having intercourse with Taylor, but argued that she was essentially a prostitute and willing participant.\\" Others, including Herbert Lovett, denied knowing anything about the attack. However, one of the assailants, Joe Culpepper, admitted that he and the other rapists were out looking for a woman the night of the attack, that Lovett got out of the car with a gun and spoke to Taylor, that Taylor was forced into the car and later forced out of the car and made to undress at gunpoint, was raped and later blindfolded and left on the side of the road. Culpepper's retelling of the story was directly in line with Taylor's original account. However, even with this information including several of the alleged assailants testimonies, the attorney general \\"failed to convince the jurors of Henry County that there was enough evidence to indict the seven suspects when he presented Taylor's case on February 14, 1945.\\" The second all-white male jury refused to issue any indictments. Aftermath The black community was shocked at the second dismissal of Taylor's case. The news coverage of the second hearing was more hostile towards Taylor based on the false claims of her being a prostitute. The assistant attorney general stated that: \\"This case has been presented to two grand juries in Henry County and both grand juries have not seen fit to find an indictment\\", claiming that \\"no facts or circumstances connected with this case have been suppressed.\\" Despite the outcome, the case was considered a major victory for the formation of the civil rights movement because of the successful mobilization of activists across the nation: \\"The Recy Taylor case brought the building blocks of the Montgomery bus boycott together a decade earlier.\\" Taylor lived in Abbeville with her family for two decades after the attack. She said that during those years she lived \\"in fear, and many white people in the town continued to treat her badly, even after her attackers left.\\" She eventually moved to Florida where she worked picking oranges. She later separated from her husband. Their only child died in an automobile accident in 1967. Taylor lived for many years in Winter Haven, Florida, until her family brought her back to Abbeville, due to failing health. The publication of Danielle L. McGuire's book At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance--a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power in 2011 led to formal apologies from the Alabama Legislature to Taylor on behalf of the state \\"for its failure to prosecute her attackers.\\" A joint resolution was adopted by the Alabama legislature on April 21, 2011, stating: > BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH HOUSES THEREOF > CONCURRING, That we acknowledge the lack of prosecution for crimes committed > against Recy Taylor by the government of the State of Alabama, that we > declare such failure to act was, and is, morally abhorrent and repugnant, > and that we do hereby express profound regret for the role played by the > government of the State of Alabama in failing to prosecute the crimes. > > BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we express our deepest sympathies and solemn > regrets to Recy Taylor and her family and friends. State Representative Dexter Grimsley, along with Abbeville Mayor Ryan Blalock and Henry County Probate Judge JoAnn Smith, also apologized to Taylor for her treatment. Taylor received the apologies on Mother's Day in 2011, when she visited Rock Hill Holiness Church in Abbeville, the very church where she worshipped the night of the crime. \\"I felt good,\\" she said. \\"That was a good day to present it to me. I wasn't expecting that.\\"\\" In 2011, Taylor visited the White House and attended a forum on Rosa Parks at the National Press Club.Danielle Wright, \\"Recy Taylor Visits White House\\", Associated Press report on BET, May 13, 2011. A 2017 documentary by Nancy Buirski, The Rape of Recy Taylor, premiered at the Venice Biennale and the New York Film Festival, and is screening across the U.S. in 2018. The award-winning film focuses on Taylor and her family recounting their struggle for justice, and seeks to expose a context of systemic racism that fostered the crime and coverup, and persists today. In 2018, Oprah Winfrey, spoke of Taylor saying, \\"They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone ... Recy Taylor died 10 days ago. . .for too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared speak their truth to the power of those men ... And I just hope ‚Äî I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth ... goes marching on.\\" In discussing the historical context, Danielle McGuire, noted, \\"Decades before the women's movement, decades before there were speak-outs or anyone saying 'me too,' Recy Taylor testified about her assault to people who could very easily have killed her ‚Äî who tried to kill her.\\" In describing Taylor later in life, McGuire said \\"She was funny, witty. She was a churchgoer. She loved going to church, she loved to sing. She was very welcoming ...\\" At the 2018 State of the Union, members of the Congressional Black Caucus invited Taylor's family to attend the speech and wore red \\"Recy\\" pins in honor of Taylor. Death Taylor died in her sleep at a nursing home at the age of 97 in Abbeville, Alabama, on December 28, 2017, just three days before her 98th birthday. She was buried next to her daughter's grave at New Mount Zion Freewill Baptist Church.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the ICGJC as an active hate group. The ICGJC teaches that the descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes and true biblical Jews are the Black Americans, West Indians, and Native Americans of North and South America and those scattered throughout the whole planet, but not the Jewish people or the Africans. The group claims that the \\"Black Israelites\\" have divine favor and inspiration and are superior to \\"Edomites\\" (white people) and all other non-Israelite people. They also hold strong apocalyptic views regarding the end of the world. The ICGJC believes that Yahawashi (Jesus) is God's divine Son and Messiah, and the redeemer for the sins of the Israelites and no other nation, that the Old and New Testament and Apocrypha are inspired Scripture, but the group does not believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the group's leaders are \\"obsessed with hatred for Edomites\\", and in 2008 had churches in cities in 10 US states. Its headquarters are in New York City. Its leader (known as \\"Chief High Priest \\") until his death in April 2020 was Tazadaqyah. Overview The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ is the second largest Black Hebrew Israelite organization in the United States, the first being the Nation of Yahweh. While \\"most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor antisemitic and do not advocate violence\\", the ICGJC is and does. History The group formerly had its headquarters at One West 125th Street in Harlem, then known as the Israeli School of Universal Practical Knowledge, and its wider movement is known as the One West Camp, including offshoots such as the modern Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge. Beliefs =The 12 tribes of Israel= Poster outlining the Black Hebrew Israelite identification of the Twelve Tribes of Israel with modern peoples of color Unlike the majority of Black Hebrew Israelite groups which generally identify the biblical Israel with the continent of Africa, the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ and its offshoots believe this only applies to African Americans and the African diaspora in the Americas, as well as to Native American and Latino peoples of the Western Hemisphere. According to the beliefs of the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ and its offshoots on the popular \\"12 tribes chart\\", the twelve tribes of Israel have their order listing along with their respective national identities shown below: * Judah: Negroes (African Americans) * Benjamin: West Indian Blacks * Levi: Haitians * Simeon: Dominicans * Zebulon: Guatemala to Panama * Ephraim: Puerto Ricans * Manasses: Cubans * Gad: Native- American Indians * Reuben: Seminole Indians * Asher: Colombia to Uruguay * Naphtali: Argentina/Chile * Issachar: Mexicans This Hebrew Israelite group and most others teach that some of the twelve tribes of Israel are made up of lighter non-Spaniard Latin Americans and Native American Indians conquered and enslaved years ago; they are the northern Kingdom of Israel that migrated \\"over the waters\\" [they believe this means to the Americas] during the reign of Cyrus the Great according to 2 Esdras 13:40-45 and Deuteronomy 33:17. Some have mixed themselves among their captors which explains the lighter complexion and hair texture difference according to Hosea 7:8 \\"Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.\\" The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ claims that blacks who were enslaved in 1619 are the southern Kingdom of Judah according to Joel 3:1-7. They base the list shown below on Genesis 49 and Deuteronomy 33. Organization =Ranking system= Positions in the Israelite church which may only be filled by a high priest at the higher orders include Bishop, Chief Priest, Apostle, and/or Holy Apostle. These leaders are primarily responsible for the spiritual welfare of the members and the administration of local church units. But they have also subservient positions that are filled by other men when they are \\"elevated\\" by the \\"spirit\\". These are 13 shield generals, all the way down to 1 shield generals. Captains of 10,000 to Captains of 1,000. Top Officers of 5,000 down to Top Officers of 500. Officers of 100, and recruits. Perhaps the most prominent leader of the church was Tazadaqyah (Jermaine Grant), who rose in to power of the church in the late 1990s. Tazadaqyah was proclaimed by many of his followers to be the God-sent \\"Comforter\\" of the Nation of Israel. The Israelite Church and its various splinter groups can be loosely grouped together as sects, which advocate a Hebrew and Authorized King James Version-only approach to the Bible (i.e. they only endorse the Hebrew/Greek and AKJV versions of the Bible), and the notion that Caucasians are Edomites.Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) - Religious Tolerance. Retrieved 7 November 2011. Controversies =Lawsuit over plastic figures= In 2013, the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ ordered action figures cast in the image of their leader (Chief High Priest Tazadaqyah) from a toymaker. When they received the dolls they sued the toymaker (Vicale Corp) because they did not like the dolls. The church complained that the dolls did not look like Tazadaqyah and were not black enough, that the Connecticut toymaker put \\"pointed noses and faces\\" dolls. The church also complained that half of them \\"were light brown\\" instead of \\"dark brown,\\" according to the court papers. =Perceived enemies= According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the group lists among its enemies white people, \\"who they preach are descended from a race of red, hairy beings, known as Edomites, who were spawned by Esau, the twin brother of Jacob\\" (later known as Israel) in the Old Testament. \\"Equally hated\\" are \\"fraudulent\\" Jews (i.e., the people known to the world today as Jews), \\"the synagogue of Satan,\\" Asians, promiscuous black women, abortionists, continental Africans (who, according to ICGJC and other extremist Israelites, \\"sold the lost tribes of Israel, who were black, to European slave traders\\"), and gay people, who \\"according to extremist Israelites should all be put to death\\". =Allegations of black supremacy and racism= In late 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) described the ICGJC and other black supremacist Hebrew Israelite groups as \\"the extremist fringe\\" of the movement. It wrote that the members of such groups \\"believe that Jews are devilish impostors and ... openly condemn whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery\\". The SPLC also said that \\"most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence\\". In 2017, they listed the group as a black nationalist hate group.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation- world/national/article209939089.html The Black Hebrew groups characterized as black supremacist by the SPLC include the Nation of Yahweh and the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ. Also, the Anti-Defamation League has written that the \\"12 Tribes of Israel\\" website, maintained by a Black Hebrew group, promotes hatred and black supremacy. =Fraud and tax evasion charges= In April 2018, the leader of ICGJC Jermaine Grant, known as Tazadaqyah and ICGJC treasurer Lincoln Warrington were arrested on fraud and tax charges. The United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey alleged the men \\"used their positions to divert millions of dollars for Grant‚Äôs personal use and benefit.\\" Grant and Warrington pleaded guilty to evading tax after using an entertainment company to divert funds from the church members for their own benefit, spending 5.3 million dollars on a lavish lifestyle without declaring the money to the government. In January of 2020, Grant was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison while Warrington was sentenced to 12 months and a day. They were also to be under three years of supervised release. The federal prison system has no offer of parole. Before he was to report to prison, Grant died on April 1, 2020, from a brief illness.Coronavirus suspected in death of Harlem 'cult‚Äô leader whose church required 20% tithes =2019 Jersey City shooting= On December 10, 2019, two ICGJC members, David N. Anderson (age 47) and his girlfriend Francine Graham (age 50), killed four people and wounded three others in a mass shooting targeting law enforcement and a kosher grocery store in Jersey City, New Jersey before being killed by the police. On December 10, 2019, a police officer approached two persons at the Bayview Cemetery in regards to an investigation that he was conducting. It is believed that he approached the suspects, who were in a U-Haul van that was related to a murder the previous weekend in nearby Bayonne. The police officer was shot and killed. His body was discovered and reported.https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/jersey-city-shooting-timeline-what- we-know-so-far/2239928/ The suspects then fled in the stolen vehicle and drove about one mile to a grocery store, where they fatally shot three civilians and exchanged gunfire with the police for over an hour until they were shot and killed. The vehicle was later found to contain a live pipe bomb.  Presence in the United Kingdom  In September 2019 The Jewish Chronicle reported that a YouTube video showed demonstrators thought to be from the church outside a supermarket in Stamford Hill, London verbally attacking local Jews, referring to them \\"as \\"Amalekites\\", \\"Edomites\\" and \\"devils\\" - as well as \\"Slavic, German, Yiddish-speaking abominations\\" who \\"own all the media\\".\\" Death of Tazadaqyah According to the group's website, Chief High Priest Tazadaqyah died Wednesday, April 1, 2020, after catching COVID-19.The Comforter  See also  * African-American ‚Äì Jewish relations#Black Hebrew Israelites * Afro- American religion * Alliance of Black Jews * Groups claiming an affiliation with the ancient Israelites References External links *ICGJC Holy Conception Unit *ICGJC Pittsburgh Division *ICGJC Maryland and Washington D.C.

There are two Cape Hachimans located in close proximity to one another: Cape Hachiman in Katsuura, and Cape Hachiman a few kilometers to the north in Isumi City. The cape is named after Hachiman, a mythological Japanese god of archery and war. Geography The cape consists of steep 40-meter high sea cliffs. It is rich in subtropical vegetation. Especially noteworthy are the Castanopsis tree, an evergreen of the beech family, and in the tabu species of laurel. History Cape Hachiman was known as a natural point of maritime defense at least as early as the Heian period. The ruins of Katsuura Castle are located prominently on the cape. The castle was built in the 10th century, while Cape Misaki was part of Kazusa Province. The castle is traditionally thought to be constructed by the Okiyo no ≈åkimi clan of Kazusa Province. It was later transferred to the powerful Masaki branch of the Satomi clan of Awa Province. In 1549 the Satomi clan relinquished the castle to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who destroyed it. Cape Hachiman Park Cape Hachiman Park was established to include access to the cape, the remains of Katsuura Castle, and the Katsuura Lighthouse. Cape Hachiman is home to a small shrine, the Hachiman Shrine. The park includes the grave of 130 soldiers who died in a shipwreck off the coast of Katsuura during the Boshin War (1868‚Äì1869).

Chalchiuhtlicue was the river and ocean goddess, who also presided over Aztec wedding ceremonies. She is usually shown wearing jade; here she holds spinning and weaving tools (image from the Codex Rios). Statue of a kneeling woman, possibly a goddess (1300 to 1521 CE). Women in Aztec civilization shared some equal opportunities. Aztec civilization saw the rise of a military culture that was closed off to women and made their role complementary to men. The status of Aztec women in society was altered in the 15th century, when Spanish conquest forced European norms onto the indigenous culture. However, many pre- Columbian norms survived and their legacy still remains. History The status of Aztec women has changed throughout the history of the civilization. As emphasis on warfare increased, notions of egalitarianism became less important. Marriage Aztec marriage practices were similar to those of other Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Maya. Aztecs married at a later age, during their late teens and early twenties, whereas in Mayan culture it was not unusual for marriages to be arranged by parents for a son and daughter who were still children. Aztec marriages were initiated by the parents of the potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents would approach a professional matchmaker (), who would approach the potential bride's family. The parents of the young woman would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal. Brides were expected to be virgins before marriage, although young people of both sex were advised to be celibate. The marriage celebration was a four-day event, and the wedding ceremony took place on the first day. The bride would wear fine robes. Her kinswomen would decorate her arms and legs with red feathers, and paint her face with a paste containing small shimmering crystals. The ceremony would take place at the house of the groom's parents. A fire would be lit in the hearth, and incense would be burned as an offering to the gods. The groom's parents would give presents (robes and mantles) to the bride's parents. The ritual for finalizing the marriage involved the matchmaker tying the groom's cape to the bride's skirt, and then the groom's mother would give the bride and groom each four mouthfuls of tamales. Four days of feasting followed the ceremony. For the purpose of political, military or economic alliances marriages among Aztec nobles were arranged. For example, when Cosijoeza married Ahuitzotl's daughter to seal the alliance between the Aztecs and the Zapotecs in 1496. Aztec kings reportedly had dozens of wives and many children. However, polygamy was only a practice among the nobles of Aztec civilization; the majority of the population were monogamous. Pregnancy, childbirth, and the tlamatlquiticitl One of the few positions of power women could hold in Aztec society was that of the tlamatlquiticitl, or the midwife. These women were proficient in dealing with difficulties arising during pregnancy and labour but as most of the information we have about their practices is passed on from upper class Aztec men and the Spanish conquerors, much of the traditional knowledge has been lost. A tlamatlquiticitl attended every pregnant woman, no matter status or class, although women of higher status often had more than one attend them. The tlamatlquiticitl was essential to assisting in birth, and additionally to providing prenatal care advice. The Florentine Codex outlines much of the advice the tlamatlquiticitl gave to expecting mothers. The mother was advised to engage in sex with her husband during the first few months of the pregnancy so as to help the child develop, but around the seventh or eighth month she was to abstain. If she did not it was believed that the semen may act like glue and the baby would not come out, or if it did it would be feeble with misshaped fingers and toes and covered in what looks like atole so that everyone would see how the couple could not abstain, and they would be shamed. The expecting mother was also told she must avoid prolonged periods in the sweat bath, for too much heat was thought to roast the child and it would be stuck inside the womb; however, too much heat specifically around the abdomen area would cause the child to swell and suffer from the heat.de Sahag√∫n 1969, p 155. Chewing chicle was not allowed otherwise the baby would be born with perforated lips and would not be able to suckle or eat.de Sahag√∫n 1969, p. 155. Likewise if she ate earth or chalk the child would be in poor health.de Sahag√∫n 1969, p. 156. The tlamatlquiticitl knew that the baby took nourishment from the mother and so what she ate it would absorb; if she fasted the child would starve. Because of this the mother was to eat and drink well, even after the birth. The mother was also warned not to look at anything red otherwise the child would extend crosswise, making for a complicated delivery. She was not allowed to observe lunar eclipses, otherwise the child would be born with a cleft palate. Eclipses were also associated with miscarriages. And she was also not to look at anything that would frighten or anger her lest she should harm the child. Walking around late at night was avoided otherwise the child would cry incessantly. If the mother took naps during the day the tlamatlquiticitl warned that the child would be born with unusually large eyelids. Lifting heavy objects was also associated with damaging the fetus. The tlamatlquiticitl also told others that the expectant mother should not be in want of anything, all her desires should be fulfilled quickly otherwise the child would suffer. Not only did the tlamatlquiticitl provide this advice but she also attended and took over household duties for the expectant mother towards the end of the pregnancy. This support, in combination with the advice on stress management, such as avoiding stressful relationships, and the suggestion to not lift heavy objects or overwork themselves, helped to contribute to the healthy psychological development of their children. The woman would know when it was almost time for her delivery as she would feel discomfort in her womb a few days prior. Because the tlamatlquiticitl resided in the house, the mother was well prepared for the birth. If the child presented in breech position the tlamatlquiticitl, who was skilled in massage, would take the mother into a sweat bath and massage the womb to turn the baby around. The typical position for labour was squatting, as gravity would assist as the child was being pushed out. To induce labour the tlamatlquiticitl would at first give the mother Montanoa tomentosa, and failing that, they would then administer a drink made from possum tail, that was shown to prompt contractions.Burkhart 2014, p. 444 In modern clinical trials, many of these mixtures have been proven to have induced contractions.Bruhns 2014, p. 144 However the Spanish Friars believed these concoctions to be witchcraft, and since both ritualistic and natural elements were used by the tlamatlquiticitl, the Spanish decided the tlamatlquiticitl was evil and the colonizers eradicated these practices. The act of birthing was considered a battle and the tlamatlquiticitl would give the mother a miniature shield and spear for the fight.Schwartz 2018, p. 23. When the baby was born, the midwife would make a series of battle cries, praising the mother who had fought through her labour to deliver the baby. The tlamatlquiticitl would cut the umbilical cord which connects the child to its mother and the gods, and it would be dried. After the placenta came out it was taken and buried in a corner of the house by the tlamatlquiticitl.de Sahag√∫n 1969, p. 169. Then the preserved umbilical cords were buried, and according to the Spanish accounts, they would be buried near a battlefield if the child was a boy or beneath the hearth if it was a girl, to indicate their futures.Eberl 2013, p. 466. According to the birthing almanacs such as the Codex Yoalli Ehƒìcatlthe umbilical cord was planted to ensure the relationship between the gods and child. If the child died in childbirth, the tlamatlquiticitl would employ an obsidian knife to remove the fetus in pieces so as not to harm the mother.de Sahag√∫n 1969, p. 157. The tlamatlquiticitl warned the mother not to be trouble by the loss of her child otherwise the spirit of the child would suffer. Scholars argue, with evidence based in bioarcheology, that this same method was also used to perform abortions, although they were generally frowned upon.Schwartz 2018, p. 29. The life of the mother was the priority over saving the fetus if the situation was life-threatening, and if the mother was at risk, then the fetus would be dismembered so she would survive. Women who died during childbirth were given the same honour as a soldier who was slain in battle, and were portrayed as spirits known as cihuateteo. After delivery the tlamatlquiticitl would remain in the house so as to help the mother and monitor her milk supply. Since the child would not begin weaning until after 24 months, this was an important process.Schwartz 2018, p. 26. These four days of monitoring also were to ensure a speedy recovery of the mother, and so the tlamatlquiticitl would prepare baths and meals for her. After this period, the bathing ceremony would take place. The Codex Mendoza depicts the bathing ceremony, which was conducted by the tlamatlquiticitl, four days after the birth. The child was washed in an earthenware tub on a rush mat and on each side were symbols, one for boys and the other for girls. For girls the three objects had to do with homemaking: a basket, a broom, and a spindle.Ross 1978, p. 70. And there were five objects for boys, which had to do with male professions: an obsidian blade representing a featherworker, a brush for a scribe, an awl that carpenters work with, a tool used by goldsmiths, and shields with a bow and arrow for a warrior.Eberl 2013, p. 465. The tlamatlquiticitl circled around the mat counter-clockwise with the child, washed the child, and then shouted out the name she has chosen for the child as she presented it to the gods. The water she used to cleanse the outside and inside of the body does not serve the same symbolic function that it does in a Christian baptism, but rather it is used to arouse the spirit of the child and let the gods in.Eberl 2013, p. 470. The Codex Yoallo Ehƒìcatl depicts this bathing ceremony as performed by the gods, and but it is understood that the tlamatlquiticitl impersonated the gods while performing these rituals because they so closely resemble what is depicted.Eberl 2013, p. 469. For example, the Yoallo Ehƒìcatl shows images of the gods presenting the children as well as cutting the umbilical cord. After the ceremony the tlamatlquiticitl would swaddle the child and give a speech to the mother on how valiantly she had fought and how it was time for rest.de Sahag√∫n 1969, p. 179. Kinsmen were then invited to see the child and praise the mother, which concluded a successful birth. Women and labor Women mainly worked inside the home, spinning and weaving thread from cotton, henepen, or maquey agave. They used a handheld drop spindle, then wove cloth using a loom that they strapped to their backs and held in their laps. They were responsible for tending turkeys and dogs that were raised for meat. Extra cloth, vegetables or other items were taken by women to the nearest market to be sold or bartered for a needed item. One of the most important roles of Aztec women in the home was to prepare maize flour for making tortillas, an important tradition for Mexican families today. Dried maize was soaked in lime water, a process known as nixtamalization, and the nixtamalized grains ground. As part of Aztec etiquette, men ate before women. Women had a number of other professions in Aztec civilization, including priest, doctor, sorcerer. Women were often recognized in their civilization as professional weavers and crafters. Images in Aztec codices, ceramics and sculptures display the elaborate and colorful designs of Aztec weavers. There were regional textile specialties, with associated graphic designs. Most designs were geometric, with some regions specializing in textiles with animal and plant images. Cotton was generally used, and dyes came from blue clays, yellow ochres, and red came from insects living in nopal cacti. Purple was derived from the sea snail Purpura patula, similar to how the Phoenicians also derived purple dye used for royal robes from snails. However, Aztec women were not allowed a role in the military. They could not be admitted into the military training school. This meant that women were denied access to one of the largest sources of wealth and prestige within Aztec society. Spanish rule Illustration of an Aztec woman blowing on maize (corn) before putting it into the cooking pot, so that it will not fear the fire. From the late 16th-century Florentine Codex The Spanish conquest of Aztec territories decreased much of the indigenous population, through warfare and by bringing new diseases, such as smallpox, for which the Aztecs had no immunities. The population that did survive these threats was confronted by profound attacks upon their culture in the form of Spanish institutions such as the Roman Catholic religion. As early as 1529, the Spanish began coercively converting Aztecs to Catholicism. They focused on the Aztec nobility initially, to create an example for the other Aztecs to follow. Nobles such as Quetzalmacatzin, King of Amaquemecan (Chalco), were forced to choose one wife and abandon the others, to comply with the current Christian institution of marriage, which meant monogamy. Aztec polygamous arrangements, with secondary wives and children, were not legally recognized by the Spanish, who considered such women and children illegitimate and disinherited from claims to ranks or property. This also tore apart the political and economic fabric of Aztec culture, since noble marriages were made with political and territorial claims in mind. Working demands became harsh for women after the Spanish arrived and the encomiendas were created. Aztec communities had already lost many men to war and epidemics, and the encomiendas meant that more men worked outside of their villages for the encomenderos. Traditional gender-based divisions of labour became irrelevant. Women no longer had men to do plowing, and were left to do all the agricultural tasks themselves, which included the planting and harvesting, as well as growing enough produce to meet the tribute demands of the encomiendas. . Over several generations, many young women left the rural areas to work as domestic servants or as market vendors in the cities. By the 17th century, Andean women were the majority of the market vendors in colonial cities such as La Paz (Bolivia), Cuzco (Peru), and Quito (Ecuador). The new Spanish culture prohibited women working outside of their home as their priority was to raise children. Their independence as workers with paid occupations was ended by the Spanish, particularly in textile work. When the Spanish eventually set up industrial textile mills, they had only men working in the mills.

In a brief career which lasted from November 1955 to June 1956, Lavandin ran five times, winning twice. He is best known for his win in the 1956 Epsom Derby. Background Lavandin was bred in France by his owner, the ‚Äúperfume king‚Äù Pierre Wertheimer. His sire, Verso (also known as Verso II), was the outstanding French colt of his generation, winning the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1943. Lavandin‚Äôs dam, Lavande won three races and produced the top class sprinter Le Lavandou, but was later barren for four successive years. Wertheimer had decided to have the mare put down, but was persuaded by Verso‚Äôs owner, the Comte de Chambure to have her covered by his stallion in 1949. Lavandin was the result. Lavandin was sent into training with Alec Head at Chantilly. Racing career =1955: two-year-old season= Lavandin did not appear on the racecourse until late autumn. He ran in a minor race at Maisons-Laffitte in November and finished second. =1956: three-year- old season= On his three-year-old debut, Lavandin was sent to Longchamp in April for the Prix de Boulogne over 1900m and recorded his first win. He was then moved up in class for the Prix Hocquart over 2000m. He finished third, but appeared to be an unlucky loser, with his jockey Roger Poincelet being blamed for his defeat. Lavandin was sent to England for the Derby at Epsom, with the Australian Rae Johnstone taking over as his rider. The colt became Wertheimer‚Äôs first runner in the race after more than forty years of involvement in the sport. Despite driving rain, the race attracted an estimated crowd of 250,000, including the Queen Mother. In an open betting race, Lavandin started favourite at 7/1 in a field of twenty-seven. Having been held up in the early stages, Lavandin passed the long time leader Monterey a furlong from the finish and held off the strong- finishing Montaval to win by a neck. The fact that the first two horses were trained in France, following on from the victory of Phil Drake in the previous year, led some commentators to state that British racing had ‚Äúhit rock bottom.‚Äù On his final start, Lavandin was injured when running unplaced behind Vattel in the Grand Prix de Paris. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Lavandin a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù Derby winner. Stud career Lavandin retired to stud in France, where he stood as a stallion until being exported to Japan in 1963. The most notable of his European progeny was the filly Blabla who won the Prix de Diane in 1965.

It is close to the University of Birmingham. The stump from the \\"Selly Oak\\", a large oak tree on Oak Tree Lane was situated in the park after it was felled in 1909.  History  The park‚Äôs history is well documented, in a book,Pugh, Ken (2010) The Heydays of Selly Oak Park: 1896‚Äì1911, Brewin Books, Studley, and an associated website. It was the first park developed under the authority of the former Kings Norton and Northfield Urban District Council. In February 1899, Thomas Gibbins and his wife Emma Joel Gibbins (n√©e Cadbury) and her four sons, William, Thomas, John and Benjamin (of the Birmingham Battery and Metal Company,, The Birmingham Battery and Metal Company, p. 62.) donated ‚Äú11 acres, 2 roods and 5 perches‚Äù of land ‚Äúfor ever‚Äù, arranging for the Park to be laid out,, Public Parks and Gardens of Birmingham, p. 36. and a shelter, public conveniences and a park-keeper‚Äôs lodge to be built. The park was formally opened by the 88 year old Mrs. Gibbins on Easter Monday, 3 April 1899. The gift was marked by the naming of the adjacent Gibbins Road (formerly Old Lane). In 1911 the district fell within the scope of the Birmingham Extension Order and the park moved into the care of Birmingham City Council. Following the 1899 gift of land there were four further donations: * In February 1913, was donated by Messrs. William and John Gibbins (Birmingham Battery and Metal Company). * In June 1919, Messrs. William, John, W.W., and R. Lloyd Gibbins (Birmingham Battery and Metal Company) offered another of land, and a lodge with its garden adjoining the entrance from Harborne Lane. These properties, with tenants, were conveyed to the City in December 1919, and came into park use in September 1922 at the end of the tenancy agreement. * In July 1935, in Corisande Road was given by Mr. D.D. James (Excelda Housing Supplies Ltd. ‚Äì the developer of the new housing estate) to form an access from Weoley Park Farm Estate. * In October 1950, of land at the rear of 52-62 Gibbins Road was donated by the Birmingham Battery & Metal Company. In March 1958, of land at the junction of Gibbins Road and Harborne Lane (previously used by the City Transport Department as a grit and salt store) was transferred from the City‚Äôs Public Works Committee. In more recent years there have been two transfers of land from the park: * In July 1980, 0.04 acres of land at Harborne Lane was transferred to the City Education Department, to be leased to the 1st Ariel Scout Group for H/Q building purposes. * In November 1982, 0.30 acres of land at 187 Harborne Lane was transferred to the City‚Äôs Economic Development Committee and subsequently leased for a nursing home. Selly Oak Park shelter The shelter (built in 1899), the bandstand (built in 1908) and the Daughters of Rest Pavilion (built in 1953) have been demolished. Today, the Park is maintained for Birmingham City Council by Quadron Environmental Services who provide its non-resident park keeper.  Community support  In 2011 an active community support group, The Friends of Selly Oak Park,Friends of Selly Oak Park working with the local Council laid out an Art, History and Nature Trail.

Ravidas (also Raidas, Rohidas[1] and Ruhidas in eastern India) was a North Indian Sant mystic of the bhakti movement who was active in the 15th century CE. Venerated in the region of Uttar Pradesh as well as the Indian state of Maharashtra, his devotional songs and verses made a lasting impact upon the bhakti movement. He is often given the honorific \\"Bhagat\\" or \\"Sant\\". This film was released on 1 January 1983 in Hindi language. Synopsis A shoemaker of the Chamar caste, all of his devotional songs were preserved included in the Sikh holy book, the Adi Granth, by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev.[2] There is also a larger body of hymns passed on independently that is claimed and attributed by some to Ravidas ji. Ravidas was subversive in that his devotionalism implied a levelling of the social divisions of caste and gender, yet ecumenical in that it tended to promote crossing of sectarian divides in the name of a higher spiritual unity.[3] He taught that one is distinguished not by one's caste (jƒÅti) but by one's actions (karma) and that every person has the right to worship God and read holy texts.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242847/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ehZdZYoHBYhttp://www.induna.com/1000002863-productdetails/ Music #\\"Man Changa To\\" - Manna Dey #\\"Shyam Salone Samne Aao\\" - Usha Mangeshkar, K.

The unit was first organized as the 2nd Battalion, Arkansas State Troops.  Organization  12th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment was originally organized as a group of Volunteer Companies raised from the militia regiments of southern Arkansas, immediately following the fall of Little Rock, Arkansas, to Union forces in September 1863. Governor Harris Flanagin began organizing a new force of state troops issuing a proclamation on August 10, 1863, just a month before the capitol fell, announcing that he had been authorized to raise new regiments of state troops and that by special agreement these new units could not be transferred out of the state by Confederate authorities. After the fall of Little Rock, recruiting was far more difficult than it had been in the first years of the war. The constant transfer of Arkansas troops into the eastern theater of the war, across the Mississippi River from their homes, was a major objection by the remaining population of men eligible for military service. With Federal forces now occupying the state capitol, the Confederate state government had no way of enforcing conscription laws in the counties behind the Union lines, except during raids by Generals Sterling Price and Joseph O. Shelby in 1864. The remaining Confederate regiments were plagued by desertions. On September 16, 1863, in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the state capitol, Governor Flanagin issued General Order No. 6 from Arkadelphia, which called into service the militia regiments of the counties of Clark, Hempstead, Sevier, Pike, Polk, Montgomery, La Fayette, Ouachita, Union, and Columbia in order to resist the Federal army. The Governor's order directed the regiments to march to Arkadelphia, Arkansas, at the earliest possible day. Companies were to be mounted and commanders were to compel persons evading the call to come to the rendezvous. The intent was to form companies of twelve-month mounted volunteers. Only six physicians, one druggist, millers to supply the wants of the country, clerks, sheriffs, postmasters, and persons in the employ of the Confederate States were exempted from the order. In describing this call in a letter to General Theophilus H. Holmes dated October 18, 1863, from Washington, Arkansas, the new Confederate state capitol, Flanagin stated that he issued the order calling out the militia, as an experiment, expecting to get volunteers. The order succeeded so well as to get companies organized in the counties where the call for the militia was enforced which resulted in seven companies being collected under the call. Flanagin also stated that \\"the troops raised by the State are more than double all the troops raised by volunteering, or by the conscript law, within the past few months\\". = 2nd Battalion, Arkansas State Troops = John Crowell Wright, lieutenant colonel of the 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, resigned from that regiment to take command of a newly organized battalion of cavalry. On December 17, 1863, the 2nd Battalion, Arkansas State Troops, was organized with seven companies from southern Arkansas.Gerdes, Edward G.: \\"Wright‚Äôs 12th Arkansas Cavalry, CSA\\", Edward G.

The poem was first published in The New Masses in December 1931 and later in Hughes's autobiography of that time period, The Big Sea. The poem is considered one of Hughes' most direct indictments of economic inequality of the 1930s. Structure The first of six sections entitled \\"Listen Hungry Ones!\\" sets up the poem by taking quotes from the Vanity Fair advertisement and addressing those statements to poor people of New York. The second section, \\"Roomers\\" gives a description of the menu found at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to those accustomed to flop-houses and soup-lines. Next in \\"Evicted Families\\" the $10,000-a-year apartments are described. The fourth section \\"Negroes\\" is written in African-American vernacular and describes the Waldorf with a sarcastic awe. \\"Everybody,\\" the penultimate section of poem, continues with details about amount of carpets used and addresses directly the very people unable to experience any of the luxuries of the Waldorf. The last section, \\"Christmas Card,\\" takes the poem in a more directly political direction. The gulf between rich and poor can only be bridged by revolution and the poem ends on such a note: \\"Listen, Mary, Mother of God, wrap your new born / babe in the red flag of revolution: The Waldorf-Astoria's the best manger we've got.\\" Hughes, Langston. \\"Come to the Waldorf-Astoria!\\" in Pau Lautner (ed.), The Heath Anthology of American Literature. vol. D. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage, 2010. 1553. Print. Surrounding the two-page poem the illustration appears to be a faithful depiction of an advertisement with bold, creative headings, but the caricatures in the large hotel in the center of the poem show people drinking and carousing while a car driving through the picture appears to be riding on a street made of the faces and bodies of other people. Context The poem was composed in response to a multi-page advertisement for the new $28 million hotel Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York. The Great Depression had begun to hit New Yorkers and disproportionately affected minorities in the city.Rampersad, Arnold, The Life of Langston Hughes Volume 1: 1902-1941. I, Too, Sing America. New York: Oxford University Press, 1986. Print. The disparity between the rich and poor was widening at the onset of the Depression and Jim Crow laws furthered that economic hardship along racial lines. Hughes said of the poem: \\"The hotel opened at the very time when people were sleeping on newspapers in doorways, because they had no place to go. But suites in the Waldorf ran into thousands a year, and dinner in the Sert Room was ten dollars! (Negroes, even if they had the money, couldn't eat there. So naturally, I didn't care much for the Waldorf-Astoria.)\\"Hughes, Langston, The Big Sea: An Autobiography. Quoted in Modern American Poetry. 2001. University of Illinois. 2001. Web. October 23, 2011. Critical response The poem is viewed as a response to the economic milieu as well as cultural, racial, and class issues. \\"Advertisement for the Waldorf Astoria\\" is frequently grouped together with Hughes's other radical leftist writings of the 1930s. When Hughes first submitted his manuscript for The Big Sea, Carl Van Vechten found that \\"Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria\\" was \\"bad economics and bad poetry\\" but he nonetheless encouraged its inclusion in the collection stating that it was a part of Hughes's \\"essential history\\". When it was published in The Big Sea in 1940 Richard Wright wrote of the poem that it exemplified the toughness of Hughes that he could approach even the solidarity he feels with the working class with \\"humor, urbanity, and objectivity\\".Wright, Richard. A Journal of Opinion. October 28, 1941. Reprinted in Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and K. A. Appiah (eds), Langston Hughes: Critical Perspectives Past and Present, New York: Harper, 2000. Print. Critics have argued that by parodying a high-priced advertisement for an even higher-priced hotel and juxtaposing those images with the most economically disadvantaged and those who would never be able to take advantage of the amenities offered by the hotel that Hughes was writing with the ideals of worker rights in mind that would later form the basis for the political and social ideals collectively referred to as the Popular Front. In his essay \\"The Adventures of a Social Poet\\" James Smethurst argues that \\"one of the most noted features of Popular Front aesthetics is a conscious mixing of genres and media ‚Äì of 'high' and 'low,' of 'popular' and 'literary,' of Whitman and Eliot, of folk culture and mass culture, of literary and nonliterary documents.\\"Smethurst, James. \\"The Adventures of a Social Poet\\", in Steven C. Tracy (ed.), A Historical Guide to Langston Hughes, New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. Print. Hughes' use of vernacular mixed with high-brow cultural elements within \\"Advertisement‚Ä¶\\" reflects those ideals.

The company was formed in Maidenhead by brothers Ron and Arthur Hacker in 1959, and traded successfully until 1977. Financial difficulties resulted in the company being sold and relaunched with the name Hacker Sound which closed in 1979. History The Hacker brothers, Ron (born 1908) and Arthur (born 1910), founded Dynatron in the late 1920s with help from their father Harry, but in 1955 Ekco took over the company, which at the time employed 150 people. By 1959, the number of employees had risen to 250, but the Hacker brothers were uncomfortable with the arrangements and decided to set up their own company, Hacker Radio Limited. In December 1960 Ekco merged with Pye, then Pye was bought by Philips in 1967. In 1981, Roberts Radio bought Dynatron from Philips. The Hacker brothers acquired a factory in Cox Green, Maidenhead, and started producing a range of transistor portable radios, beginning with the RP10 Herald. Throughout the 1960s, profits were healthy and the workforce increased. In 1973, the company was awarded its first Royal Warrant of appointment, and gained a second in 1976. But financial difficulties experienced in the 1970s caused the company significant problems, and despite cost-cutting measures, the firm's bankers called in the receivers in May 1977. The assets were bought by Pullmaflex and the company reformed as Hacker Sound; the Hacker brothers were retained as consultants. Arthur Hacker's son John, who had been made a director in 1975, was made Technical Director. However, difficulties continued, and the company was bought by Motoradio, who moved the operation to Bournemouth. Finally, a fire put an end to activities, and the Hacker trademark was purchased by Roberts Radio. Hacker Radio primarily marketed its products to the UK domestic market, and were priced towards the top of the market. This, plus the relatively short period of operation (only two decades) results in a lower brand awareness today compared to other household names such as Roberts Radio. However, Hacker products have a strong following among vintage radio enthusiasts and collectors. An active group on Yahoo boasts over 400 members, and maintains a set database that lists almost 1000 Hacker sets (as of November 2011). Hacker sets are known to be in the possession of enthusiasts in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, China, Russia, and throughout the European Union. Company philosophy The stated Hacker philosophy was to focus on technical performance rather than cost, and words to this effect are frequently found in printed material from the time. Many examples of their products survive today, and it is widely accepted among vintage radio enthusiasts that the build quality is higher than most similar sets from the same era. Notable models Hacker produced many products during their 19 years of trading. Some of their more notable models are described below - a full list is available on-line. =Herald= The first product launched was the RP10 Herald. In common with many of their 1960s designs, this was built into a wooden case covered in leathercloth, with foam padding under the front and rear panels and a turntable to enable the set to be rotated for best reception (the internal ferrite rod aerial being highly directional). It featured a large (5 inch by 8 inch) 30Œ© loudspeaker, and was powered by two PP9 batteries. Initial sets used Ediswan transistors; later sets used Mullard devices, including the AF117, which unfortunately went on to suffer from tin whisker formation within the encapsulation. The Herald was an AM only set, covering the medium wave and long wave bands. A three position tone control switch was provided. The radio was initially available in beige or deep red with brass trim, but towards the end of the run, alternative colours were offered (blue with chrome and white trim, or black and grey, also with chrome trim). The next Herald, the RP30, retained the same loudspeaker and grill, but had a restyled cabinet that retained the padded leathercloth, which was available in charcoal black, blue or red (the latter with brass trim). The electronic design was revised, and the audio amplifier was rather more complex, incorporating rotary bass and treble controls. Coverage was MW and LW as before, but a version including short wave (16.5 to 50 metres) was offered (the RP31SW). Later, another version offering Marine Band (70 to 200 metres) in addition to MW and LW was released (the RP32), but this sold in relatively small numbers, and few exist today. These sets continued to use the Mullard AF11x-series of transistors. The RP35 looked quite similar to the RP30, but the top panel (containing the controls and tuning scale) is quite different in detail if not layout. The available colours were the same as the RP30 Herald. Electronically, these are quite different from the previous models, introducing a separate transistor for the oscillator, and a new, more compact layout for the IF PCB. The audio amplifier is improved while the component count is reduced - now the loudspeaker is 15Œ©. Initially these used the Mullard AF117 transistors, but switched over to using silicon BF194 and BF195 \\"Lockfit\\" transistors from serial number 19001. Another AM Herald, the RP82, was introduced towards the end of Hacker's existence, but these are very scarce indeed. Electrically, they are based on the very basic AM-only RP70 Ranger. =VHF Herald= The RP37 VHF Herald looked like a third-generation Herald, but the presence of a telescopic aerial indicated that this is an FM-capable receiver; indeed it was an FM-only radio. Like most Hacker sets from the 1960s and early 1970s, this set used two PP9 batteries. They were available in the same colour choices as the RP35 AM Herald, and there was a variant with a revised scale in royal blue that incorporated the Open University logo in place of the local stations. The terms of this arrangement are presently unclear. Mirroring the changes in the RP25A Sovereign described below, the later RP37A VHF Herald had a revised FM tuner; recognisable because it has a clear plastic cover rather than an aluminium enclosure. At a similar time, the loudspeaker was changed from a grey painted unit made by Goodmans to a silver-framed Celestion or a unit supplied by Elac which was recognisable by the large ceramic magnet assembly. This latter loudspeaker was only ever fitted to the VHF Herald. =Sovereign= This was Hacker's premium portable model, featuring AM and FM reception, and the name was used for four generations of the receiver. The first three versions featured separate tuners and IF stages for the AM and FM sections. The first generation, the RP18 Sovereign, was released in 1964, and was slightly larger than the contemporary Herald. The case was leathercloth- covered wood with padding for the front and rear panels, and was only available in charcoal black. The same large loudspeaker was used. The FM front end was bought in from German company G√∂rler, and the rest of the tuner sections used Mullard AF11x-series transistors. User-adjustable station markers were provided to indicate the position of three favourite stations - but as these could only be moved over the lower half of the FM band (which only extended to 101 MHz), they were intended to locate the three national BBC services available at the time. The next generation, the RP25 Sovereign II, was very similarly styled, with the external differences being most noticeable on the top panel. This model was available in charcoal black and blue. The audio and AM sections were identical to the third-generation Herald, and the FM sections were a new design with the FM front end now made in-house; the FM and audio sections went on to appear in the RP37 VHF Herald. Initially, AF117s were used in the AM tuner, but from serial number 13001, BF194/195s were adopted (the FM sections used these silicon devices from the outset). This set introduced an ISM (inter-station muting) function for the FM band, operated by a switch that also enabled the AFC function, which eliminates the loud noises typically heard when tuning across the FM band. There are now four station markers, which can be placed anywhere within the band (which still only reached 101 MHz). The RP25A had a redesigned FM front end; the new tuner is distinguishable by the clear plastic cover rather than the earlier aluminium case. At a similar time, the grey-painted Goodmans loudspeaker is replaced by a model made by Celestion - the later is recognisable because it has a painted silver frame and magnet. At some point towards the end of the RP25A production run, an 18 volt DC input socket is added to the left hand side panel. And finally, the RP25B uses a different FM IF PCB, incorporating an integrated circuit and ceramic filter. During the RP25A run, an all-white version was released. These are relatively uncommon today, and good examples can sell for higher prices than otherwise similar black or blue sets. Next, in 1973, the RP72 Sovereign III is released with very different styling compared to the previous models - featuring teak side panels and extruded aluminium for the loudspeaker grill and top control panel assemblies. Separate AM and FM tuners are retained, while the audio stages gain a new pre-amplifier that incorporates passive Baxendall tone controls. The loudspeaker is slightly smaller at 7 by 5 inches, and is now supplied by Peerless. The set is powered by eight 1.5 volt \\"D-cells\\" rather than two PP9s. Earlier models had a DC- input socket on the back; later models incorporate a mains power supply and are designated RP72MB. While the majority of these sets are restricted to 101 MHz on the FM band, later models were able to tune to 104 MHz. The ISM function was dropped, but switchable AFC remains. A common problem with these sets concerns the screen printing on the top panel, which can wear away. The final Sovereign - the RP77MB Sovereign IV - was rather different. It used simpler and cheaper circuitry that no longer had separate AM and FM sections. The case was somewhat larger because it was originally designed to accommodate a cassette mechanism; the RP77MB Sovereign IV was a radio-only version of the RPC1 radio-cassette recorder. The styling was similar to the previous model, with a black anodised finish to the aluminium components. The turntable was dropped for this model. As with the Sovereign III, operation is from eight D-cells or the mains supply, and MW, LW and FM (to 104 MHz) bands are covered. The amplifier circuitry is simpler than the Sovereign III; in fact, it's electrically very similar to that used in the Sovereign II - though with some component changes. The loudspeaker is a 5 by 8 inch model made by Elac. =Super Sovereign= There was a variation of the third-generation Sovereign called the RP75 Super Sovereign. This took the basic RP72 Sovereign and added two short wave bands - the only Hacker set to include both FM and SW. Coverage was 10.9 to 33 metres and 27.5 to 89 metres. Electronic fine-tuning (band- spread) was provided, and switchable ISM returned to the FM band; separate switches are provided for ISM and AFC, unlike the Sovereign II where these functions were combined on one switch. A signal-strength (and battery test) meter was provided. Echoing the development of the RP72, a mains power supply was added (the RP75MB), then the FM coverage was extended to 104 MHz. With the MB models, an ATU (aerial tuning unit) was included to improve short-wave reception. The speaker fitted to the RP75 and RP75MB was the same as the RP72, but with a larger magnet. =Hunter= The RP38 VHF Hunter was released in 1969, and was intended to be an \\"economy\\" set. It had MW, LW and VHF coverage, but with a cheaper combined tuner section (which was more in line with the majority of sets at the time anyway), and a simplified audio amplifier that lacked the separate bass and treble controls of the Heralds and Sovereigns. The cabinet was also cheaper to make and lacked a turntable. Initial models used the same 5\\" by 8\\" Goodmans loudspeaker as the contemporary RP35 Herald/RP25 Sovereign, but a model from Elac quickly replaced this. An updated version followed a year later: the RP38A. This added bass and treble controls, using an amplifier that was electrically very similar to that in the RP35/RP25. This model was in production for many years, and went through several cosmetic changes before production ended in 1976. Initially available with side panels in finished hardwood or covered with black leathercloth, and black leathercloth covered front and rear panels (with no padding), the grill was thin aluminium perforated sheet which picks up dents rather easily. In 1973, a new grill was introduced - the same as the Sovereign III \\"family\\" - which was a heavy and thick aluminium extrusion. At some point afterwards, the handle is changed to a three-part unit that matches the rest of the Hacker range, and then towards the end of the run, the silver tone control knobs are replaced with black plastic versions. All versions of the Hunter have an FM band that is limited to 101 MHz (and non-switchable AFC). The Hunter remains a popular set, despite its original \\"budget\\" status, and frequently achieves high sale prices on auction. The Elac loudspeaker provides a good audio performance, many enthusiasts preferring it over the various Sovereign sets. =Mayflower= In 1962, Hacker released the RV14 Mayflower; an FM-only valve table radio finished in striking veneers. Unusually for a Hacker, this set had coverage to 108 MHz - the FM front end was supplied by G√∂rler. The audio sections were based around a pair of ECL86 triode/pentode valves that operated in push-pull, delivering around 7 watts in ultra-linear mode to a large (10 by 7 inch) loudspeaker. An EM84 \\"magic eye\\" tuning indicator valve was used. The RV20 Mayflower II was released in 1963. This was electrically very similar, but had a very differently styled cabinet. The FM tuner was a different model that had reduced coverage to 104 MHz, but added an AFC function. Other products Hacker made many mono record players, most of which could be converted to stereo with the purchase of a matching amplified loudspeaker; the GP15 Cavalier, GP42 Gondolier and GP45 Grenadier being commonly encountered examples. They also made a number of radiograms, and later music centres with matching loudspeakers and badge-engineered cassette decks from Japanese manufacturers including Sanyo and Nakamichi.

On the leg between Senegal and Brazil the Super Constellation was on approach to Rio de Janeiro‚ÄìGale√£o International Airport when it crashed near Flecheiras Beach just short of the runway. All 29 passengers and seven of the ten crew were killed. It was the first fatal accident involving Lufthansa since it was formed in 1955. Accident The aircraft was cleared by air traffic control to descend to over Guanabara Bay as part of the approach sequence to Runway 14 at Rio de Janeiro‚ÄìGale√£o International Airport. During the descent the weather was rainy. Descending too low on approach, the Constellation struck the water with the aircraft's nosewheel; the crew attempted to continue the approach, but were unable to maintain control, and the aircraft crashed near Flecheiras Beach. All of the aircraft's passengers (including both the literary impressaria Susana Soca and the Archduchess Maria Ileana of Austria-Tuscany, granddaughter of King Ferdinand of Romania) as well as seven crewmembers died; the co-pilot, a steward and a stewardess survived the impact. Aircraft The aircraft, a Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation airliner powered by four Wright R-3350 radial piston engines, had been built in 1955, and was delivered to Lufthansa on 17 May 1955. The aircraft was sold to Seaboard World Airlines in May 1958, but had been returned to Lufthansa in November of that year. Probable cause An accident investigation was unable to determine the cause of the crash, but considered that the most likely cause of the accident was pilot error, resulting in Flight 502 descending below the minimum altitude required for the approach. The crew had exceeded the flight time limits set by Brazilian aeronautical regulations, but not under German rules; aircrew fatigue was determined to be a contributing factor.

Collectively called the \\"transportation department\\" in the early 20th century, the three structures comprised a horse barn or stable, a mule barn and a blacksmith shop. The horse barn is the largest of the structures. As it stands, it is about by , having reportedly lost in length due to a fire at some point. The wood frame structure is sheathed on the lower half with board-and-batten siding, with wood shingles on the upper half. The roof is covered in green asphalt shingles. The interior contains two main spaces, with an open room in the east that was probably used for wagons. The west side has two floors. The upper level was used for storage, and contains three rooms formerly used as storerooms. Downstairs are open stalls on one side and closed stalls on the other side. The building is topped by a large cupola. The mule barn is similar to the horse barn but smaller, measuring about by . The interior has an upper and lower level, disposed similarly to the horse barn, except the stalls are enclosed with open ends. The mule barn has a somewhat smaller cupola than the horse barn. The blacksmith shop is an L-shaped building with a main block of by and an extension that projects about . The exterior appearance matches the other two buildings. The interior is divided into three rooms, one of which contains two blacksmith's forges. The structures continue to be used to house and support the mule trains that take visitors and supplies to the Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

In 1835, Middle Ridge had the middle of three 1835 railway cuts (cf. Herr Ridge & Seminary Ridge) excavated for the Tapeworm Railroad. In the 1850s, the Old Mill Road across the ridge had been established northwest from the Hagerstown Road past the J. Herbst farm along Willoughby Run. During the 1858 Hopkins survey, the \\"H.

Walker Jr. (born ) is an American former basketball player. He was a native of Queens, New York and played the guard position. Walker played collegiately for the Toledo Rockets from 1948 to 1951. He was known as an excellent dribbler and passer, and was the first officially recorded national season assists leader with his 7.24 per game average during the 1950‚Äì51 NCAA men's basketball season. However, Walker's collegiate accomplishments were overshadowed by his involvement in a point shaving scandal during his senior year. During a game against the Niagara Purple Eagles on December 15, 1950, Walker's Toledo Rockets held a lead of 17 points with three minutes remaining. In the final minutes of the game, the Rockets misdribbled the ball, threw errant passes and only won the game by three points. The game began suspicion among spectators that a fix had occurred and an investigation was subsequently commenced. Walker and teammates Carlo Munzi and Robert McDonald were found to be involved with the point shaving plot after having been instructed to win the Niagara game by less than the predicted seven points following a payment from New York gambler Eli Klukofski, who had been involved in other fixes. The three Toledo players had turned down opportunities to point shave previous games against the Michigan Wolverines, Illinois Fighting Illini and Denver Pioneers as it \\"meant too much for them and the school\\" to defeat those teams. For the Niagara game, Walker received $1,750 from Klukofski and gave $250 each to Munzi and McDonald. No charges were formally placed against Walker and his teammates as the state of Ohio had no laws dealing with sports bribery. Prior to enrolling at Toledo, Walker had served in the United States Navy. Walker graduated from Toledo just six weeks before the accusal; he was 25 years old, was married and had fathered one son at the time. Walker showed remorse for his involvement in the scandal.

It is hypothesized to cause headaches by influencing the trigeminovascular system via TRPA1. Space-filling model of umbellulone.  History  Umbellularia californica is a tree native to the coastal forest of California. Menzies was the first to collect the oil at the end of the 18th century. In 1826 this tree was classified as a laurel, Laurus regia, by Douglass. He probably intended to indicate the beauty and splendor of the tree. In 1833 the tree got another classification by Hooker and Arnott, Tetranthera californica. Shortly after that the present name was given by Nuttal, Umbellularia californica. In 1875 Heaney obtained a colorless liquid (Oreodaphenol) via fractionation under reduced pressure. This oil of the California laurel possess a pungent odor. Stillman (1880) did a fractionation at 215-216 ¬∞C. He discovered that inhalation of its fumes can lead to a painful cold sensation and severe headaches. In earlier times the leaves of the tree were used for cures for headaches or stomachaches and even toothaches. Powers and Lee did in 1904 another fractionation on the oil of the tree at 217-222 ¬∞C. This yielded different compounds: pinene, cineol, eugenol, methyl eugenol and a ketone called umbellulone. Umbellulone is the chemical responsible for the headaches induced by the tree. They gave umbellulone the following structural formula (Fig. 1). Figure 1: Strucutural formula according to Powers and Lee, 1904. Figure 2: (A) Strucutural formula according to Tutin, 1908. (B) Structural formula according to Semmller, 1908. In 1908 the structural formula was adapted by Tutin (Fig. 2A). This was corrected later that year by Semmller; he gave the structural formula which is accepted today (Fig. 2B).  Structure and reactivity  Umbellulone is a monoterpene ketone that is found in the leaves of Umbellularia californica. The formula of umbellulone is C10H14O, containing a cyclopropane and cyclopentane ring. There is only one isomer of umbellulone known. Umbellulone is a lipophilic liquid (oil) at room temperature. The boiling point of umbellulone is 220 ¬∞C and the vapor pressure is 0.159 mm/Hg. Umbellulone has a high-affinity binding for thiols. The molecule is reactive with most of the thiols, but not with all. The reaction between the thiol cysteamine and umbellulone, is given in figure 3. A European registered medicine called Cystagon¬Æ or Procysbi¬Æ contains cysteamine, which can interact with umbellulone. Figure 3: Reaction between cysteamine and umbellulone.  Synthesis  A possible synthesis of umbellulone is given by the following process. Diazomethyl isopropyl ketone reacts with methyl methacrylate to give 1-carbo-methoxy-2-isobutyryl-1-methylcyclopropane. This reaction gives a yield of 35%. This is then hydrolyzed to a mixture of cis and trans 2-isobutyryl-1-methyl-1-cyclopropane. The trans isomer is isolated and reacts with the cadmium methyl Grignard reagent to 1-acetyl-2-isobutyryl-1-methylcyclopropane. This undergoes an aldol cyclization on treatment with dilute base to umbellulone.  Mechanism of action  Figure 4. TRPA1 channel agonists can activate the TRPA1 channel to release CGRP. CGRP will bind to its receptor and will initiate vasodilation. Umbellulone is known to be able to interact with two ion channels, TRPA1 and TRPM8. Umbellulone has a high affinity to TRPA1 and a lower affinity to TRPM8. TRPA1 Umbellulone can cause severe headaches by activating transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) and influencing the trigeminovascular system via calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Once inhaled, umbellulone will diffuse from the nasal mucosa into the blood circulation. Because of the high lipid solubility of umbellulone, the molecule will quickly pass through the epithelial cells and will quickly be absorbed in the blood. From there on, umbellulone is able to reach the perivascular sensory nerve endings of the meningeal vessels. Stimulation of these nerve fibers will eventually lead to the release of CGRP, a nociceptor known for its ability to induce migraine and cluster headache attacks. Activation of TRPA1 by umbellulone results in the opening of this ion channel. Calcium will enter the cell and the cell membrane will be depolarised. Depolarisation of the membrane will result in the release of CGRP1. Released CGRP can bind to its CGRP-receptor. This will induce a CGRP-dependent local vasodilation (Fig. 4) of the cerebral blood vessels. Vasodilation of the cerebral blood vessels will increase the blood flow to the brain's outer membranes. CGRP binding to its receptor will also promote mast cell degranulation and infiltration by neutrophils and other immune cells. The increase in immune cells and its inflammatory response is thought to be the main cause of the occurrence of migraine. Its is still being discussed if vasodilation of the cerebral blood vessels contributes to the cause of the migraine and headaches. Still, the vasodilatory effect and the blood flow increase can be used as an indirect indication for the release of CGRP and therefore for the presence of the migraine and headaches. TRPM8 Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8 (TRPM8) is an ion channel that is able to induce an intensely cold sensation when activated. Menthol is the primary ligand of TRPM8, but since umbellulone has some structural similarities with menthol, umbellulone is also able to activate TRPM8. But this is a weak interaction.  Indications  Exposure to umbellularia is likely to result in an intense cold sensation in the nasal cavity. When combined with a headache, an increase in plasma CGRP or irritation of the eyes, the possibility for the person to have been exposed to umbellulone increases.  Toxicity  The oil of Umbellularia californica contains 40% to 60% of umbellulone. It possesses an effect similar to atropine on the nerves and muscle fibers. Contact with the oil, or exposure to the vapors, can cause: *Headache *Irritation to eyes *Irritation to the nose *Irritation of the mucous membrane *Loss of concentration *Lowering blood pressure *Difficulty with respiration Umbellulone induces rapid production of methemoglobine. Methemoglobine is a globin in the blood that mainly consists of ferric (Fe3+) haemoglobin, instead of the usual ferrous (Fe2+) haemoglobin. Methemoglobin has a decreased ability to bind oxygen, but, in combination with the 3 other ferrous ions on the hemoglobin unit, the oxygen release is also decreased. Red blood cells will be less able to nurture organs with oxygen, therefore, the probability for hypoxia increases. Methemoglobin lethality is possible at concentrations higher than 50% of the substance in red blood cells. Umbellularia californica should not be mistaken for the conventional bay leaf (Laurus nobilis), which is devoid of these toxic effects.  Other applications  In 2013, a new potential application of Umbellularia californica came to light. The essential oil was used for its mosquito biting deterrent and larvicidal activity. This encourages further investigation of this oil. Not only as a natural repellent for other arthropods, but also for medical and veterinary importance. This could lead to a new molecular-based approach to ethnopharmacological investigation of essential oils for pest control.  References  3\\\\.

Sometimes called the \\"Number One Citizen of Huntsville\\" and a \\"Symbol of the New South,\\" he was recognized as a humanitarian, leader in opportunities for minorities and the handicapped, and advisor to government officials and congressmen. The Cummings Research Park, the second largest park of this type in America, was named to honor him. Early years Cummings was born in Gadsden, Alabama, where his father, Charles Wesley Cummings, was the superintendent of a cotton gin. The elder Cummings was a second-generation native of Huntsville, Alabama, and soon moved his family back to that city. Afflicted with osteomyelitis, Milton lost a lower leg when he was four years old. He attended school in Huntsville and, coping well with an artificial leg, became an excellent tennis player. While still in school, he worked as an errand runner in the office of a cotton broker where his father was employed. Impressed with Milton's determination, intelligence, and handicap adjustment, the broker offered him a full scholarship to attend college as he finished high school at age 16. Feeling obliged to help support his family, he declined the offer of college but asked for employment in the brokerage firm. His father died a few years later, leaving Milton responsible for the family while still a teenager.Davis, Louis; ‚ÄúNew Throne for a Cotton King,‚Äù The Nashville Tennessean Magazine, 19 Jan. 1964, pp. 6-7 Cotton broker and investor In his early 20s, Cummings worked in the Shelby Fletcher Brokerage firm and learned the cotton brokering business during the Great Depression. In 1936, Fletcher suddenly died and left $5,000 for Cummings in his will. Using this inheritance, at age 25 he opened a brokerage. Madison and Limestone Counties in northern Alabama were (and still are) two of the largest cotton producers in the state.\\"Agriculture in Alabama,\\" Encyclopedia of Alabama; http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1396 Cummings soon became well known to the farmers, buying their bailed cotton and selling it to the huge spinning and weaving cotton mills in Huntsville. Respected by all of the people involved as an 'honest broker,' Cummings was soon the most successful cotton merchant in the region.Davis, op. cet. In 1953, Cummings became dissatisfied with cotton brokering. In his words, ‚ÄúI didn't feel that President Eisenhower, Agriculture Secretary Benson, or even the American farmer really understood the agricultural problems of the day. Their policy showed they favored lower farm prices and uncontrolled production, inviting disaster for cotton, and for farmers in general.‚Äù His projection was verified by declining cotton profitability.Firch, Robert S.; ‚ÄúAdjustments in a Slowly Declining U.S. Cotton Production Industry,‚Äù Am. J. Agricultural Economics, Vol. 55, Dec. 1973, p. 892 Convinced that he should change from brokering to investing, Cummings, starting in 1953, devoted his financial expertise to managing personal investments in the stock market. For the next several years, with his own stock ticker and constant attention to the market, he exhibited a genius for buying and selling at just the right time. In this, Cummings was highly successful and soon amassed a considerable fortune.Davis, op. cet. Industry executive In 1957, Cummings was invited to invest in a new stock issue for Brown Engineering Company (BECO), a small industrial firm in Huntsville. Although BECO was almost bankrupt, Cummings recognized its potential of gaining a foothold in the emerging space market. He had become a friend of Wernher von Braun, who at that time was leading the space program development for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) at Redstone Arsenal. Convinced that the space field was where Huntsville business was headed, Cummings immediately made a major investment in BECO stock. Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite of the Earth, was launched by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, energizing America to do likewise. After the failure of their Viking rocket in its first satellite launch attempt, this mission was taken away from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and given to the von Braun team at ABMA. On 31 January 1958, America's first satellite, Explorer I, was placed into orbit. BECO had an involvement in this historic effort, providing support in the design and testing of both the vehicle and the payload.‚ÄùJupiter C Puts Up Moon ‚Äì Eisenhower Officially Announces Huntsville Satellite Circles Globe‚Äù; ‚Äú9 Labs Here Aided Project Launching‚Äù; The Huntsville Times, Satellite EXTRA, 1 Feb, 1958, p. 1 As the Nation watched via live television, Huntsville had an unequaled celebration. This previously unknown community in Alabama was suddenly at the center of the free-world's space race with the Soviet Union. The government laboratories on Redstone Arsenal, together with Huntsville's emerging industries, immediately acquired recognition as a center for high- technology. Cummings then knew that he was right in his business projection. On 6 May 1958, the BECO Board asked Cummings, then the Board Chairman and largest investor in its stock, to serve 90 days as President. He accepted, but actually remained in that position for eight years. In Cummings' words, \\"Once I had the opportunity to more closely examine Brown Engineering, I became convinced of its great potential and accepted a permanent position.\\" In a short time, he placed the firm on a sound financial footing. The stock was initially traded as over-the-counter, then, underwritten by Goodbody & Company, 110,000 shares became publicly traded under the symbol \\"BCO\\" on the American Stock Exchange in April 1964. At that time, there were about 1,400 stockholders, including almost 500 BECO employees.‚ÄùBrown Engineering Annual Report, 1964‚Äù Wernher von Braun had suggested to Cummings that Huntsville needed a central research park for the emerging space and defense industries. A large section of former farmland was found on the western edge of Huntsville, adjacent to the developing campus of the University of Alabama Huntsville Graduate Center (later to become the University of Alabama in Huntsville) and near to Redstone Arsenal. Through purchases and options, rights to hundreds of acres of this land was secured by Cummings (primarily to forestall speculators), and the Huntsville City Council was persuaded to designate as the Huntsville Research Park. BECO became the first occupant in the new park, opening a large complex in early 1962, and was soon followed by Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing, TRW, IBM, and other national firms. In 1973, shortly after Cummings' death, this was renamed the Cummings Research Park; it has now grown to become the second largest research park in America and one of the largest in the world.‚ÄùCummings Research Park,‚Äù Huntsville Chamber of Commerce; Cummings' vision for BECO was that it would be involved in the full spectrum of space and defense activities, from initial research, through engineering development, to final manufacturing and testing. As the new BECO campus in the Research Park was developed, areas devoted to all of these activities were established. Engineering centered on a capability for space vehicle design, but there were also general capabilities in electronics, mechanical, civil, and other engineering disciplines. Manufacturing soon had digital-controlled machines, and was the largest local source for precision parts, printed circuits, and full system fabrication. In-house research was a newcomer to BECO capabilities; the Brown Engineering Research Laboratories had a two-story building devoted to analytical and experimental activities, including optics, propulsion, radar, computers, aerodynamics, and other high- technology areas. Through adding well-qualified and experienced technical and administrative personnel, Cummings led BECO's growth from about 215 employees when he took over to over 3,700 when he retired in 1966. =Space business= The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was formed on 1 July 1960, with a staff of about 4,000 former employees of ABMA and Wernher von Braun as Director. Cummings quickly secured a role for BECO in the development of the Saturn family of booster rockets. In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed the national goal of \\"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth by the end of the 1960s,‚Äù and the Apollo program was underway. During the first half of the 1960s, there was tremendous growth in the number of contractor firms and their activities at MSFC. In 1965, NASA directed MSFC to simplify the administration and obtain a single prime-support contractor for each of its laboratories. Cummings obtained permission from von Braun for BECO to propose on support to two of these major efforts. The company won the most sought-after efforts, those for the Propulsion & Vehicle Engineering Laboratory and for the Research Projects Laboratory. BECO was also a major subcontractor for two other laboratories. From the beginning of the Apollo Program in early 1961 through the first manned landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, BECO (becoming Teledyne Brown Engineering in 1967) played a major, highly diverse role, providing approximately 20,000,000 man- hours of engineering, scientific, manufacturing, and administrative support. In 1969, Cummings received the NASA Public Service Award for his leadership.NASA 1969 Public Service Awards; https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol4/appa.htm The citation reads as follows: \\"For his outstanding contributions as a key leader of the government-industry team that made possible the exceptional success of the Apollo Program.\\" =Defense business= While a large part of the former ABMA went to form MSFC, there were still major U.S. Army activities on Redstone Arsenal, and BECO had work in some of these. In May 1962, most of the activities were consolidated to become the U.S. Army Missile Command (AMC). Although Cummings was mainly involved with increasing BECO's work for MSFC, he recognized the potential of business with AMC and established close relationships with many of the leaders. One of these was Colonel (later Brigadier General) Ivy O. Drewry, Manager of the new Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) program. In 1967, BECO's Research Laboratories became the support contractor for the emerging Nike-X ABM system. (Starting in the 1970s, the Safeguard Program, descendant of Nike-X, would become one of the company's largest contracted activities.) Another AMC leader was Carl E. Duckett, at that time Director of the Missile Intelligence Directorate. Duckett and Cummings immediately had a mutual respect; both were from relatively modest backgrounds, neither had a college education, both were ‚Äúpeople‚Äù oriented, and both had highly successful early careers. BECO's Research Laboratories performed highly classified intelligence studies, and Cummings received the first Top Secret security clearance granted to a Huntsville business executive. Although Duckett left AMC in the mid-1960s for a leading position with the Central Intelligence Agency, their relationship continued until Cummings' death. =Maturity and acquisition= By 1966, Brown Engineering Company had matured to become a viable player in the space and defense industry. The quiet influence and leadership of Cummings and the operational and technical expertise of his top staff positioned the Company to obtain vital roles with NASA MSFC; be in on the ground floor of emerging intelligence and missile defense efforts of the U.S. Army; and become recognized for its research activities. Offices and subsidiaries had been opened in several locations in the South and Northeast. To ensure continuing vitality, BECO needed to enter new, more widespread markets. Cummings and his close staff made plans for a major change, gaining a national presence by acquiring, merging, or being acquired. After eight years as CEO, Cummings stepped down and, as Board Chairman, concentrated on BECO's future. In April 1966, the BECO Board elected Joseph C. Moquin, the existing Executive Vice President, to be President.‚ÄùBrown Engineering Company Annual Report, 1966‚Äù Late in 1966, Cummings initiated negotiations between BECO and Teledyne, Inc., of Los Angeles concerning the merger of the two companies. This led to BECO's being acquired in April 1967 to become Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. (TBE), a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne, Inc. A TBE board was maintained, with Cummings remaining Chairman until his death in 1973.Roberts, George A.; ‚ÄúBrown Engineering,‚Äù in Distant Force: A Memoir of the Teledyne Corporation and the Man Who Created It, Meglin Publishers, 2007, pp. 83-85, Personal life Despite his physical disability, as a young man Cummings was a champion tennis player, regularly winning open competitions. During and after World War II, he gave demonstrations to amputees at Army hospitals. He also became an avid golfer, maintaining a handicap of only a few strokes. Throughout his career, Cummings was a ‚Äúpeople‚Äù person. While fully at ease with persons on all social strata, he especially identified himself with the working class. At BECO, he frequently visited the manufacturing facilities, where he knew many of the workers by name. He often expressed the belief, ‚ÄúWe are our brother's keeper,‚Äù and so conducted his personal life as well as his business activities.Davis, op. cet. For Cummings, a lifelong Democrat, political acumen played an important part in his success. He was a neighbor and close friend of John Sparkman, long-time member of the U.S. Senate and very influential in programs at Redstone Arsenal. Bob Jones of Scottsboro, Alabama, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, was another of Cummings' Washington friends. At an even higher level, Cummings was a frequent visitor of Lyndon Johnson in the White House. As a result, a number of BECO employees received invitations to Johnson's presidential inauguration in 1963.Davis, op. cet. He was continually involved with fund-raising drives and campaigns for improving health, education, and employment opportunities in the region. The Milton K. Cummings Humanitarian Award was established in his name by the Community Action Partnership-Huntsville/Madison and Limestone Counties, Inc. In 1961, Cummings and Wernher von Braun successfully lobbied the Alabama Legislature for funds to establish in Huntsville the University of Alabama in Huntsville Research Institute. The approved Institute initially occupied space in BECO facilities before construction started on the university's campus in December 1962. Today, that building on The University of Alabama in Huntsville campus is named Von Braun Research Hall in honor of the rocket pioneer. Cummings set an example for Southern firms in equal opportunity employment, long before it was federally mandated. In 1963, he was a principal founder and first President of the Association of Area Companies (AHAC), a Huntsville organization devoted to ensuring equal opportunity of minorities in employment, education, housing, and community affairs. Huntsville led Alabama in all aspects of race relations. Cummings was also in the forefront of providing employment opportunities for the handicapped. An article in the company's newsletter describes the contributions being made by 25 physically handicapped employees.‚ÄùHandicaps do not hold back these employees,‚Äù BECO Views, November 1965, pp. 2-3 Well before any Federal requirements, Cummings had BECO provide full accommodations for these \\"special resources.\\" Cummings received recognitions and honors. These included the following: The United States House of Representatives recognized him through a Memorial Tribute being read into its minutes in 1973.U.S. Congressman Bob Jones, \\"Memorial Tribute to Milton K, Cummings\\", 1973 Auburn University conferred the degree Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, on Cummings in August 1962.Auburn University ‚Äì Honorary Degrees Awarded; https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/acadinfo/degrees/hda.aspx Previously noted was Cummings' recognition in 1969 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as an industrial leader in the Apollo Program. Cummings married Nanny Vastus Ivy in 1936. They had three daughters, Jean, Carol Ann, and Nancy, and William Brooks Wilkinson was his step-son. A Christian, Cummings was a Deacon for 23 years and then an Elder in the Presbyterian Church.

Sir Richard Williams is notable for being the first commanding officer of the Royal Marine Artillery, and for subsequently commanding the Portsmouth Division of Royal Marines during 1827‚Äì1835. In American history he is remembered as the senior ranking officer of the Royal Marines to serve on the British North America and West Indies Station during the War of 1812. Historian Paul Harris Nicolas (1790‚Äì1860), himself a former Royal Marine officer and the author of the two-volume Historical Record of the Marine Forces (1845), paid tribute to William's firm hand in controlling the conduct of his troops on foreign soil.

On 6 July 1782, while serving aboard , Williams was wounded in the naval Battle of Negapatam (1782), which opposed British and French fleets off the southeastern coast of India. Following the end of the American War of Independence, the establishment of the Marines was reduced, and he was on half-pay for several years.A list of the officers of the Army and Marines, 35th ed., 15 February 1787 In spite of this unattached status on half-pay, the young lieutenant remained abroad on foreign service until 27 May 1785. During the French Revolutionary wars, Williams served aboard in the Channel Squadron commanded by Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet, and participated in the naval Action of 23 April 1794 near Guernsey. On that occasion the squadron captured three French warships. Ordered ashore, Richard Williams was assigned to 35 Company,Steel's Navy List January 1795 and was duly assigned to 126 Company upon his promotion to captain.Navy List 1797 Both of these companies were in the Establishment of the Portsmouth Division of the corps of Marines. As captain of Marines aboard , which was commanded by Captain Edward Thornbrough of the Royal Navy, Williams vainly sought permission to intervene promptly with his Marines against the mutineers at the Spithead anchorage. The Marine captain was subsequently among the officers sent ashore by the mutineers of the Spithead and Nore mutinies. Recognition for his loyalty and determination brought about his restoration to duty by the Admiralty. Still captain of the Marines aboard HMS Robust, Williams took part in the Battle of Tory Island on 12 October 1798.Historical Record of the Royal Marine forces, by Paul Harris Nicolas, Lieut. Royal Marines, Volume I, Thomas and William Boone London 1845 pp128,152-155,200-201,226-228 First commanding officer of the Royal Marine Artillery When the Royal Marine Artillery was formed on 1 September 1804, he was chosen to be the officer commanding, a role that he initially carried out until 1810, and again accomplished from 1816 until 1827. Battalion command in the Napoleonic Wars As an experienced and competent major with a thorough knowledge of artillery, he was appointed to set up, and command, a standing battalion of Royal Marines for foreign service. At the time, it was standard practice for Marines to be allocated to ships, on a quota determined by the rating of the ship. It was rarely the case that a body of Marines would be greater than 200 other ranks. (Manpower shortages in the Royal Marines had necessitated the use of line infantry to remedy these shortages). One other radical approach was to employ a company of Royal Marine Artillery attached to this battalion. This battalion deployed to Lisbon, and subsequently to Northern Spain for the second half of 1812. In the course of the Peninsular War, Williams gained the attention of his army seniors for the discipline and efficiency of his Marines. The Royal Marines Battalions (Napoleonic Wars) participated in a number of actions in the Peninsular War, and Williams found himself in command of British Army brigades on more than one occasion. Upon returning from Spain, Williams was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel, to avoid any subsequent issues with seniority when dealing with army field officers. He and Major James Malcolm were sent, with their respective battalions, to North America to participate in the War of 1812. Although Williams's battalion was ordered in August 1814 to be 'disposed for Naval service' and dispersed among the flotillas at Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, the war did not finish for him. There was a third Royal Marine battalion which had arrived in July, and Williams ‚Äì having seniority among the Marine field officers ‚Äì became its new commanding officer. He was present in the Chesapeake campaign, participating in the Battle of Bladensburg, the attack on Washington, and the Battle of Baltimore. The men of his original battalion were redeployed, along with his new unit, to Tangier Island, on the understanding they would be spending the winter on the island. Williams had planned to lead an expedition into Georgia in the spring of 1815, but the war had ended, and he returned to the UK. He was awarded the KCB on 25 May 1815 for his actions in the War of 1812. The battalion was disbanded, and he undertook a new command as commandant-major of the expanded Royal Marine Artillery on 1 January 1816. Peacetime field officer Williams remained at this post until 1827, when he became colonel commandant of the Portsmouth Division of Royal Marines, a position he held for the rest of his active career in the Marines.'The Royal military calendar, or Army service and commission book' edited by John Philippart, Third edition, Volume IV, AG Valpy London 1820 pp439-442'The Royal military calendar, or Army service and commission book' edited by John Philippart, Third edition, Volume III, AG Valpy London 1820 pp122-124 Promotion was slow in the Royal Marines, slower than in the other service branches.

It is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The library is located at 55 Main Street on the north bank of the Megunticook River, on the north end of the Chestnut Street Historic District. History The first library established in Camden was known as the Federal Society's Library, and was started in 1796 with a collection of 200 books. At that time, Camden was a very small town consisting of 15 houses centered on the harbor. The Federal Society's Library operated for 34 years until the books were sold at auction. In 1854, the Ladies‚Äô Library Association opened on Wood Street.Statistics of public libraries in the United States, p. 716. The library later moved to the second floor of the Camden National Bank building and remained at this location until the fire of 1892 that destroyed the Camden business district. New, lower level entrance to the library that was added in the 1990s, September 2018 On March 23, 1896, the citizens of Camden voted to establish a free public library to be known as the Camden Public Library. The townspeople of Camden raised the money to build this library through various fundraising efforts. No assistance was provided by philanthropists. Mary Louise Curtis Bok donated the land for the library in 1916. Parker Morse Hooper and Boston architect Charles G. Loring offered building plans.Heart of the Community: The Libraries We Love, p. 30. The cornerstone was laid on August 17, 1927 and the Library opened its doors on June 11, 1928 with Miss Katherine W. Harding serving as the first librarian.Camden By Cheryl L. Baisden, p. 73 The grounds of the library, including an amphitheater, were designed by noted landscape architect Fletcher Steele. The library and its grounds were designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 2013, recognized as a rare public work by Steele, and as a forerunner of modern landscape design. In 1996 the library underwent a great expansion under the south lawn. The library is one of the only libraries in Maine designated as a \\"Star Library\\" by Library Journal.

Astroblastoma cells are most likely found in the supratentorial region of the brain that houses the cerebrum, an area responsible for all voluntary movements in the body. It also occurs significantly in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe, areas where movement, language creation, memory perception, and environmental surroundings are expressed. These tumors can be present in major brain areas not associated with the main cerebral hemispheres, including the cerebellum, optic nerve, cauda equina, hypothalamus, and brain stem. The most defining physical symptom of astroblastoma, regardless of location, is elevated intracranial pressure, occurring when cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space exhibits heavy pressure and decreased blood flow, resulting in throbbing headache or nausea for the patient. Despite widespread localization in the brain, astroblastoma is rarely reported in oncological studies, accounting for only 0.45‚Äì2.8% of all brain gliomas since its discovery in 1926. Without a doubt, astroblastoma remains one of the most challenging and problematic tumors to diagnose and treat among all nervous system cancers.  Subtypes  Astroblastoma can be divided into low-grade, well-differentiated tumors and high-grade, anaplastic subtypes. The majority of tumors exhibit a spherical perimeter with either a solid or cystic interior, comprising peripheral vasculature and epithelioid neoplasms. = General Pathology = Since the early 1890s, astroblastoma has established a stable set of pathological qualities that truly distinguishes itself as a separate and significant entity. Compilations from various case reports reveal the following common characteristics: * Appears \\"bubbly\\" in nature * Polarized, unipolar in structure * Peripheral vasculature * Radial arrangement as a pseudorosette * Immunoreactive for GFAP and vimentin (supports astrocytic origin) * Lacks \\"true rosette\\" architecture * Lacks structural cohesiveness * Prominent pseudopapillae formation * Localization mostly in cerebral hemispheres * Nodular, non-invasive growth * Strong, associative vasculature in other parts of the body * Tissue fibrosis prominence * High likelihood of vascular hyalinization * Low likelihood to metastasize toward other regions of the brain = Abnormal Pathology = Beyond normal pathologies, scientists have discovered some abnormal characteristics of astroblastoma in a variety of patients. The presence of a bulky calcification with punctate (pointed) and globular features was noted in a 2009 study of a 12-year-old girl. Computerized tomography confirmed these calcified masses in the posteroinferior region to the fourth ventricle just above the midline. The mass began at the brainstem, extended along the inferior cerebellar peduncle to roof areas against the ventricles through the nodule of vermis, easily detected against normal grey matter surrounding it. Calcification deriving from nervous system tumors is a rare quality in astroblastoma patients, but it is nonetheless easy to identify. Lumbar pain and lower body weakness is also a rarity in astroblastoma patients, even though it is entirely possible for lesions to proliferate toward the spinal cord. = Associations with Other Tumors = An enormous difficulty lies in classifying an astroblastoma tumor due to its overlapping features with other brain tumors. Certain neuroradiologic features finally distinguish astroblastoma from the common ependymoma, another frequent tumor occurring in the fourth ventricle. In general, when brain lesions are smaller than Grade I, demarcating between these features is near impossible, often mistaking astroblastoma with glial neoplasms, high-grade astrocytes, and embryonal neoplasms. However, the ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù appearance in astroblastoma is entirely exclusive. Researchers have also confirmed astroblastoma distinct from oligodendroglioma, which are invasive nodular cysts that may resemble a \\"bubbly\\" interior. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma, and hemangioblastoma are well-established, pediatric brain cancer tumors that are often confused with astroblastoma patients. However, further histology has confirmed that special structures and characteristics are unique to astroblastoma. Advances in the 21st century of histology have justified proper diagnosis, eliminating inconsistency that plagued this tumor for several decades. Research going back to early 2000 marks the first complications for satisfying requirements in radiographic and histopathologic studies. Seven astroblastoma cases of comparative genomic hybridization, a molecular technique analyzing chromosomal changes in DNA content of brain cancer cells, suggested that chromosome 19 and chromosome 20q were amplified in astroblastoma cells throughout the brain. These genomic features are responsible for widespread proliferation, tumorigenesis, and deregulation of pathways associated with normal housekeeping. Furthermore, the absence of chromosome function in 9q, 10, and X were not observed in other types of neoplasms, such as an ependymoma. Specific neuronal markers further distinguish astroblastoma. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) positive, NSE negative, synaptophysin negative, neurofilament negative, TUJ1 positive, and nestin positive have been expressed in astroblastoma cell populations, showing significant promise in neuronal stem cell treatment for the tumor.  Clinical Symptoms  The majority of patients with astroblastoma display a limited set of physical and physiological symptoms. Rare cases in literature reveal atypical conditions, but these are often exclusive to the individual and do not suggest a widespread trend. As research continues, a larger set of symptoms can be properly assessed in the clinic. = Intracranial pressure = Most patients experience a series of intermittent headaches over a few weeks or sustained, powerful pressure in a matter of days. The time-frame for this pressure varies from patient to patient and fluctuate based on the stage of the tumor. Both low-grade and high-grade astroblastoma can exhibit significant discomfort from headaches, although literature supports that higher-grade astroblastoma affect a patient with day-to-day activities, forcing individuals to stay at home away from their jobs and family. Malignant astroblastoma distorts the function of surrounding brain regions, and pressure is the primary result. = Enhanced drowsiness = Along with cranial pressure, patients exhibit noticeable lethargy, increasing in severity as the tumor progresses. In the first few months, morning activities are usually unaffected; over time, these effects become more pronounced, especially late at night. Lethargy can disrupt vital signs, depleting energy and desire to perform simple cognitive tasks. = Frequent nausea = The desire to eat normally becomes worse over time, leading to weight loss from vomiting. Nausea is seen in almost all cases of astroblastoma, especially in low-grade tumors. = Impaired vision = Vision deficit usually occurs when lesions grow in the occipital lobe of the brain, causing a blurred daze for patients, especially in sensitivity to light. Focusing upon finer objects becomes a challenge, along with edge and border detection. Driving behind the wheel is dangerous when astroblastoma grows in residual tissue size, since peripheral vision can be insufficient. Horizontal nystagmus and other involuntary eye disorders can occur. = Motor system imbalance and weakness = Frequent reports show that adolescents and adults with grade III and IV astroblastoma fall frequently before they even reach a doctor's office. Alertness is diminished when walking normally, forcing patients to exhibit awkward gait patterns to avoid imbalance. = Decreased sensation = Since the motor system can be impaired with severe cases, the malignant spread of astroblastoma throughout the body may press against or paralyze the spinal cord, diminishing sensation in upper and lower extremities. = Seizures = Convulsions are observed in older patients with astroblastoma. = Psychotic episodes = Grade III and IV astroblastoma have been shown gradually change the mental stability of a patient. Hallucinations impair cognition to the point where patients experience a loss of identity, although this is not commonly seen in clinic. = Cognitive dysregulation = Irritability, aggression, memory loss, neurological deficits, and inattentiveness on everyday tasks are the most common forms of deregulation in the mental capabilities of a patient. Verbal communication is affected, but usually not to the point where close friends can detect that the individual is cognitively impaired. Diagnosis = Classification = The World Health Organization, a specialized agency that classifies abnormal tumors affecting the central nervous system and assesses potential risk to life, has difficulty in assigning a proper grade for astroblastoma. The organization‚Äôs most recent grade in 2007 assigned astroblastoma as a high-grade III and grade IV neoplasm, signifying that the glial tumor is dangerous for patients, causing fatal problems even after surgery. However, recent data compilation from 2011, one that compiled nearly 30 years of clinical information, confirms opposite results from patients: a 95% survival rate exists after astroblastoma is completely removed (gross total resection). The most important factor for any patient when cancer is concerned ‚Äì the likelihood of surviving ‚Äì is still controversial for astroblastoma, but recent advances in the last decade have improved prognosis.  Treatment  Like most tumors in the brain, astroblastoma can be treated through surgery and various forms of therapy. Many publications within the last decade have suggested a noticeable improvement in success rate of patients. With the advancement of cutting-edge technology and novel approaches in stem cells, patients are hopeful that they be happy and healthy through old age. The following factors influence an oncologist's specific treatment plan: # Patient's overall medical history # Localization and grade severity of the tumor # Age and tolerance to certain medications, procedures, and treatment # Predicted progress of recovery # Final anticipated outcome of treatment = Gross-total resection = Complete surgical removal, known as gross-total resection or craniotomy, remains the standard for treating astroblastoma, despite high recurrence rate for high-grade tumors. Since there are so few cases reported around the world each year, the standard for surgery varies from physician to physician and is often difficult to rightfully diagnose. Low-grade astroblastomas exhibit low recurrence rates following resection, but varying reports prove that some patients, despite the severity of the lesion, will unpredictably witness recurrence. In a recent study of a 17-year-old male, a low-grade astroblastoma was resected and recurred within 5 months of the therapy, forcing the oncologist to administer further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and a second resection to completely put the tumor in remission. = Radiotherapy = Radiation therapy selectively kills astroblastoma cells while leaving surrounding normal brain tissue unharmed. The use of radiation therapy after an astroblastoma excision has variable results. Conventional external beam radiation has both positive and negative effects on patients, but it is not recommended at this point to treat all types. All in all, the radiosensitivity of astroblastoma to therapy remains unclear, since some research advocate its effectiveness while others diminish the effects. Future studies must be done on patients with both total excision and sub-excision of the tumor to accurately assess whether radiation benefits patients under different circumstances. = Chemotherapy = Chemotherapy is the preferred secondary treatment after resection. The treatment kills astroblastoma cells left behind after surgery and induces a non-dividing, benign state for remaining tumor cells. Normally, chemotherapy is not recommended until the second required resection, implying that the astroblastoma is a high-grade tumor continuing to recur every few months. A standard chemotherapy protocol starts with two rounds of nimustine hydrochoride (ACNU), etoposide, vincristine, and interferon-beta. The patient undergoes a strict drug regimen until another surgery is required. By the third surgery, should recurrence in the astroblastoma occur, a six-round program of ifosfamide, cisplatin, and etoposide will \\"shock\\" the patient's system to the point where recurrence halts. Unfortunately, chemotherapy may not always be successful with patients requiring further resection of the tumor, since the tumor cell begins to show superior vasculature and a strong likelihood of compromising a patient's well- being. Oral ingestion of temozolomide for at-home bedside use may be preferred by the patient. = Future advances = A popular form of surgery involves CyberKnife radiotherapy and Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Their success-rate on cranial lesion is fairly effective, but recurrence is still a problem for severe patients. One of the more exciting and promising routes for treatment involves stem cell use to combat astroblastoma. A study in 2005 profiled cell surface markers of astroblastoma cells removed from an 11-year-old patient. Fluorescence activation suggested that about 1/4 of these cells were CD133 positive CD24, CD34, and CD45 negative. This specific genetic makeup lends to self-renewal, differentiation, and propagation of neural stem cells in the brain. However, the work remains a preliminary insight into the role of neuronal stemlike cells on astroblastoma development.  Recurrence  More than other brain tumors, astroblastoma is frequently a recurring tumor; its rate remains high, even after resection as treatment. Currently, an unfavorable prognosis exists for patients with high-grade, anaplastic astroblastoma: they tend to recur almost indefinitely, forcing the patient to invest in more invasive surgeries. In contrast, a favorable prognosis exists for patients with well-differentiated, low-grade astroblastoma, since patients usually never require such a treatment. The strict black-and-white diagnosis of an astroblastoma based on grade does not determine all tumor behaviors, but it can be used as a benchmark for patients with varying degrees of severity. = Low-grade = The likelihood of low-grade astroblastoma returning after surgery is highly improbable, but some patients have exhibited recurrence. Patients with low-grade lesions can remain asymptomatic after surgery and show recurrence 1‚Äì2 years in follow-up sessions. However, since residual tissue size is a large determinant for profiling recurrence, it is almost never the case that a low-grade astroblastoma continues to appear in size and strength after the second resection. Usually, patients are not recommended for resection at all and are simply directed towards other therapeutic techniques. Most children can continue to lead productive, healthy lives after a low-grade astroblastoma is treated. = High-grade = Surviving the symptoms of high- grade astroblastoma is not life-threatening, but a significant portion of patients die due to repeated recurrence of tumors as they continue to grow and spread. Unlike conventional low-grade tumors, high-grade tumors associate a plethora of factors when they metastasize to other areas of the body. Therefore, complications frequently occur after surgery is performed since an oncologist cannot efficiently control the tumor in a suitable time-frame. Cases in literature confirm that high-grade patients face up to five or six resection surgeries and still experience symptoms post-operatively. The dual- action of chemotherapy and radiotherapy can slow down recurrence when gross total resection is performed multiple times, but there is no guarantee that the tumor will ever be in remission. onsiderations for specialized astroblastoma therapies, but they are not mentioned in current literature.  Epidemiology  Astroblastoma predominantly affects children, but young adults are also susceptible to the tumor . Although the tumor is widely considered a pediatric disease, elderly patients are documented throughout literature. = Age incidence = The age distribution of astroblastoma is largely bimodal, suggesting that two distinct diagnosis peaks occur from ages 5‚Äì10 and ages 21‚Äì30. A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that parents of children are more likely to report symptoms of nausea and constant headaches than young adults, who may, at first, disregard these symptoms for a lesser condition. Nevertheless, a combination of age, anatomic location, and image assessment can efficiently evaluate astroblastoma. Furthermore, the age of a patient can aid an oncologist in recommending appropriate treatment plans, along with other factors. = Gender incidence = In reported cases of the tumor over the last 25 years, the number of affected females with astroblastoma is significantly higher than the number of affected males. Sughrue et al. confirmed this trend, stating that 70% of the cases with clearly stated gender were female (100 cases total). While several publications support a genetic predisposition to females, the underlying reasons are still unknown. = Environmental incidence = At this point, no literature has indicated whether environmental factors increase the likelihood of astroblastoma. Although cancer in general is caused by a variety of external factors, including carcinogens, dangerous chemicals, and viral infections, astroblastoma research has not even attempted to classify incidence in this regard. The next few decades will aid in this understanding.

A document from 1177 from the Abbey of Hauterive mentions the Romont as a wooded hill. In 1239, Anselme (or Nantelme) sold the rights to Romont hill to Peter II of Savoy. At that time, Romont was part of the territory of the Bishop of Lausanne. In 1240, Peter II sent a castellan to Romont to build a castle and found a village. The main castle (Grand Donjon), with a typical Savoy square floor plan, was completed before 1260. The original castle partially collapsed in 1579 and was rebuilt by Fribourg in 1591. Another castle with a round tower, formerly known as the Petit Donjon, but now known as Boyer-tower was built around 1250‚Äì1260, most likely by Peter II.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History In the 12th century there was a fort at Surpetra, though whether that was at the current castle site or another nearby location is unknown. The fief of Surpierre was owned by a noble family of the same name from 1142 until 1233. In the 13th century the de Cossonay family owned Surpierre and a number of surrounding villages. In the late 13th century a small castle was built on the site of the current one. A few elements of this castle were incorporated into the modern castle, including a square tower and the pointed arch windows in the chapel. By 1344 there was a small fortified village on the hill by the castle. During the 14th and 15th centuries the castle passed through a number of different owners. In 1476 and again in 1539 the castle was severely damaged in fires. In 1536 the cantons of Bern, Fribourg and Valais invaded Vaud and defeated the Savoyard forces. On 21 February 1536 Surpierre was captured by Bern, who then gave it to Fribourg on 1 March, creating a small exclave. Under Fribourg's rule, a bailiff was appointed and granted authority over the land around Surpierre. The castle was rebuilt into a home for the Fribourg bailiff. In 1544 the castle was damaged in a fire, and the Fribourg authorities decided to rebuild it from its medieval design into an imposing government center and a comfortable home for the bailiff. Several additional buildings were added to the complex and an ornate main gate was added. A drawbridge was added over the dry moat and gardens were built around the castle. Over the following centuries, the Fribourg appointed bailiffs ruled over the exclave. In 1848 the little Fribourg exclave became part of the Broye District and the district purchased the castle. Two years later, in 1850, it was acquired by the Marseille merchant Victor-Henri Leenhart-Imer. After passing through several owners, in 1951 Max B√ºrki bought it from the Delpech family.

The site was re-developed from 1305 as Daugavgrƒ´va Castle.  History  The abbey was founded in 1205 by Albert of Buxhoeveden, bishop of Riga, on the right bank of the Daugava river, and settled by monks from Pforta Abbey, of the filiation of Morimond. The first abbot, Theoderich of Treyden, also known as Theoderich of Estland, had already been active in the mission to Livonia. The second abbot, in the 1210s, was Bernard II of Lippe. The abbey's estates were in part extremely distant. For example, it owned 30 oxgangs (Hufen) of land at R√§gelin in Temnitzquell in Brandenburg that had been given to it by the Edler von Plote, on which it ran a farm. During a revolt of the Curonians and Semigallians in 1228 the monks were killed and the monastery destroyed, although soon rebuilt. In 1263 the wooden church was destroyed by a fire. In 1305 the abbey was sold to the Livonian Order, which established its commandery there and converted the site to a fortress, Daugavgrƒ´va Castle or D√ºnam√ºnde Castle. The monks moved to Padise Abbey in Estonia.  Site and buildings  The church abutted on its east side onto a strong square tower. Along the east wall of the abbey precinct were two buildings for the use of the monks, while the lay brothers had a building on the west wall. To the north were two towers. The entrance was located in the south-west corner of the outer defensive perimeter, which was surrounded by a moat more than 40 metres wide.

He was a recording artist for RCA Records and moved from playing guitar in the studio to songwriting and touring with national country music artists. Early life Schafer was born in Mount Pleasant, Michigan and began performing as a child on local radio shows and performing jamborees. He learned to play guitar at age of nine and, together with his parents, performed as area dance clubs, such as Palmer's Idle Hour Bar in Weidman, Michigan. While in high school, he played with two rock-and-roll bands, The Bark of Paper Mulberry and The Wild West Show. He graduated from Beal City High School in 1970, and relocated to Detroit to perform with the music group, the Grand Band, which was previously known as the 'Popcorn Blizzard'. Schafer replaced Marvin Lee Aday (professionally known as 'Meat Loaf') as lead vocalist in this band. Continuing in Detroit, Schafer's guitar skills caught the eye of local recording talents, including Moonstone and Skip Van Winkle, who'd scored records on the Billboard charts. Detroit ‚Äì Success in the 1970s thumbleftupright RCA Victor Canadian promo & US release single 1976 In 1974, Schafer was signed to a two-year contract with RCA Records and worked with producer Jack Richardson (The Guess Who, Alice Cooper, and Poco). In 1976, Schafer recorded his own work, \\" A Day Without You Dear,\\" which was released but failed to chart, despite substantial international airplay. That song was next covered by The Skyliners on their 1978 comeback album on the RCA Tortoise International album, then released in 2010 on the double CD \\"Once Upon a Time\\" /\\"Skyliners\\" In 1978, RCA Records released \\"Baby, Now That I've Found You,\\" the Schafer remake of the Foundations' hit single, working with producers Bruce Goldberg and Don Davis for the RCA Victor distributed 'Tortoise International' Label. RCA/Tortoise International single 1977 Based on increased experience in working with award-winning record producers, Schafer was given the opportunity to sing and produce radio and TV commercials in the Detroit area. Some of the commercials were broadcast nationally, including Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Dow Cleansers. Schafer next became a full-time guitarist and background singer for recording artists including Larry Santos and The Skyliners. Nashville ‚Äì 1980s and 1990s Relocating to Nashville in 1979, Schafer found professional success in the country music genre. Because of his versatility in playing lead guitar, pedal steel guitar, and bass guitar, Schafer was chosen, with the recommendation of Bobby Randall of Sawyer Brown, to tour with Leroy Van Dyke as pedal steel guitarist, which was a catapult that led to his opportunities in touring with several major recording artists including Barbara Mandrell, Lorrie Morgan, Keith Whitley, George Jones, T. Graham Brown, and Shania Twain. He was featured in Barbara Mandrell's \\"Do-Rite Band\\" on her \\"Moments\\" tour and appeared on the CBS Mandrell Family Christmas Special. Working with Shania Twain, Schafer was featured in multiple TV appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman on 10/2/95 and 2/26/96. Barbara Mandrell performing duet with Dan Schafer; 'Moments' tour 1986 These tours afforded him multiple opportunities to appear on TV as the featured guitarist backing these singers on numerous award shows including \\"Billboard Music Awards,\\" \\"The American Music Awards,\\" \\"Grand Ole Opry 'Live',\\" and \\"Blockbuster Music Awards.\\" Schafer then left the road and performed continuously for six years on the Grand Ole Opry, playing bass for Jack Greene. He performed at Opryland theme park and was featured in Dick Clark's American Bandstand Classics Show. He made an uncredited appearance as an extra in the November 1982, CBS movie, \\"Country Gold,\\" which featured Loni Anderson, Earl Holliman, and Linda Hamilton. In Nashville, Tennessee Schafer continued his jingle recording career and sang on commercials for Pepsi, Dole Pineapple, and Honda vehicles. Eventually, he was hired to do backup music work with Leonard Wolf for the Nashville-based GAC Network (Great American Country).

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Provo Canyon Guard Quarters  The Provo Canyon Guard Quarters is an important historical site, preserving the conflict held during the Utah War, a bloodless standoff between the federal government and the LDS Church which lasted from 1857 to 1858. These guard quarters were one of three fortifications built by the Mormon people in response to the threat they perceived from the federal government during the Utah War. The Provo Canyon Quarters, due to its location, was not likely to be involved in any battles and was assigned a mere ten men to keep up the defenses. After the Utah War this fortification served as a station to observe Native American activity until the end of the Black Hawk Indian War in 1868, after which the Guard Quarters have served little purpose. = Site Information = The Provo Canyon Guard Quarters are built off of U.S. Route 189 a couple hundred feet above the canyon floor and on the north side of Provo Canyon. The elevation the Guard Quarters are built upon is about five thousand three hundred and thirty feet. Although several of the walls remain intact, much of the architecture has deteriorated, giving way to scrub oak and additional vegetation. The quarters remain easily identifiable however. = History = In the year 1857, president James Buchanan sent a two thousand five hundred man army into the state of Utah to fight off a rumoured Mormon rebellion. There was no rebellion, however, in order to protect the LDS Church, Brigham Young responded to this action by declaring martial law and gathering in the local militia known as the Nauvoo Legion, comprising approximately one thousand two hundred men. It was at this time that fortifications were built in Echo Canyon (Summit County, Utah), Mormon Flat, and in Provo Canyon. The Utah War was resolved in 1858 as colonel Thomas L. Kane, a respected man both among the Mormon faith and among the federal troops, helped with negotiations. New governmental officials were set in place within the territory, including Alfred Cumming replacing Brigham Young as governor, and federal troops were staged forty miles outside of Salt Lake City, at Camp Floyd. When the American Civil War arose in 1861, the army was forced to abandon their encampment and leave. This turned out to advantage the Mormon people, as the army sold many of their supplies to them at a very low cost. and  References  * Roper, Roger.

Accession  Born in Meissen, Hedwig was the youngest daughter of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony, and Margaret of Austria. In 1458, the chapter of the Quedlinburg Abbey elected the 12-year-old Hedwig as successor to Princess-Abbess Anna I, who had died aged 42. Pope Calixtus III confirmed the election but decreed that the Princess-Abbess should reign under the guardianship of her father and canonesses of Quedlinburg until the age of 20. In 1465, she was invested with regalia by her maternal uncle, Emperor Frederick III, and started governing the abbey- principality on her own.  Reign  Submission of the town of Quedlinburg to Princess-Abbess Hedwig In 1460, the Princess-Abbess faced a rebellion when the city of Quedlinburg joined the Hanseatic League, attempting to gain independence from her and become a free imperial city. Gebhard von Hoym, Bishop of Halberstadt, aided the rebellion. The Bishop invaded the abbey- principality and tried to evict Hedwig. As a princess-abbess, Hedwig was subject only to the Pope and the Emperor; she forced the Bishop to renounce his claim with the help of her brothers, Elector Ernest and Duke Albert III of Saxony. Thus, for the next two centuries, the abbey-principality remained under the protection of the electors of Saxony, who would influence the election of its new rulers and often come into conflicts with them. Upon subduing the rebels, Hedwig forced the town to leave the Hanseatic League and decided to strengthen her authority within the town. Her uncle, Emperor Frederick III, admitted her to the Order of the Vase and Stole. She died in Quedlinburg and was succeeded by Magdalene of Anhalt.

It was the last steam locomotive to operate in a Welsh slate quarry.  Construction  Holy War was built in 1902 by the Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds, with works number 779.  Working life  Holy War was delivered to the Dinorwic Slate Quarry in North Wales in May 1902. It spent its whole working life in the quarry, alongside other Hunslet engines including Dolbadarn, George B, Maid Marian, Red Damsel, Wild Aster, Alice and Irish Mail. Holy War was named in 1908, one of the quarry's locomotives with names commemorating racehorses which author and Member of Parliament Sir Gerald Nabarro called \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"eccentric\\". By 1967 Holy War was the last steam locomotive to remain in operation in a North Wales slate quarry, being withdrawn in November 1967. The quarry switched to lorries when Holy War was sold, and closed in 1969.  Preservation  When steam operations ended at the quarry Holy War was sold to J Marshfield-Hutchings. Along with parts of Alice which had been bought for spares, Holy War went to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre in March 1970, where it was the Quainton Railway Society's only narrow gauge locomotive. After being used in Buckinghamshire it was purchased by Rev Alan Cliff and returned to Wales in 1975, going to the Bala Lake Railway. Restoration of Holy War was completed in 1978 and the locomotive entered traffic on Good Friday 1979. It was out of service for boiler repairs in 1985-87. The Bala Lake Railway bought Holy War from Cliff in 1989. A gala was held in June 2002 to mark the locomotive's 100th anniversary. Alice has also since been restored, and both locomotives now work on Bala Lake Railway. Holy War appears in the children's book \\"Jack the Station Cat and the Great Little Trains Robbery\\".

The first two volumes received the Janusz A. Zajdel Award nomination (in 2002 and 2003, respectively); the second one received the Nautilus Award in 2004. All three volumes were reissued in 2011. Due to an error, the second volume did not include one chapter. It was later published in Science Fiction magazine. The Achaia series is written as a trilogy and the first three volumes are considered to be the first part of the trilogy. The second part of the trilogy is called Pomnik Cesarzowej Achai.  Plot synopsis  Achaja is a firstborn daughter of one of the seven Great Dukes of Troy, Archentar. It is a Troy's tradition to have the first child sent to a military service in their youth. While most noble families manage to get their daughters out of this ordeal by temporary adopting some boys from lesser nobility, Archentar is manipulated by his young wife to actually sent the princess off to the training. Soon after, her unit is dispatched to a battlefield and captured by the enemy forces of Luan. There, Achaja is to be used as a leverage to get back lands from Troy. Upon Archentar's diplomatic visit in Luan, the girl is tortured beneath his window so that the man could hear her screams before the negotiations over lands. As the man does not budge, she is made into a slave and sent to a labour camp to build a Royal Road. In order to survive, she takes a deal made by two experienced slaves to sell her body to them for protection. One of them, Hekke, turns out to have been a famous sword master before he disgraced himself and ended up as a slave. He teaches Achaja the craft. After a while, Achaja decides to try and run away from the camp despite the risk of terrible death if she is caught. Against all odds, she manages to succeed and starts her journey which will make her take on many different roles: a prostitute, a farmer girl and finally, a soldier instrumental in a war that will change the shape of the whole continent. When Achaja is first introduced to the reader, she compares herself to a little girl of which she has been reading - alone in the woods and afraid of monsters. As her own story goes on, Achaja realises that she has now herself become a monster that little girls in the woods may be afraid of. A wizard Meredith is visited by one of the gods, who tells him to slay the leader of The Order, a powerful religious organization that oversees this world. He attempts to fulfill the god's will, but fails and is captured by the Knights of the Order. He is sentenced to life in a dark, underground cell. Even though it is said that nobody can get into the cell once it is locked, the wizard is soon visited by Virus - a creature that claims to have neither a body nor a soul. Virus promises the man to help him accomplish what nobody ever did - to escape from the Order's prison. Zaan is a highly intelligent scribe bored with the routine of everyday life. He dreams of becoming a legend, of making his mark in history and being remembered by generations to come. Yet his life passes monotonously. Until one day he meets Sirius, a young contract killer. Zaan is drawn to the adventurous life that Sirius leads and decides to become his companion. When the two men start talking, Sirius tells Zaan how as a child he was captured by pirates and made into a slave. He recounts that among other slaves on the ship, there was another boy his age - a long missing son of Great Duke Orion whose fate remained a mistery for years and was only known by Sirius. He and the prince befriended and the young royal told him many stories about Orion's court. One day, the pirate ship started leaking and everyone but Sirius died. Hearing the story, Zaan comes up with an idea to convince Orion that Sirius is in fact the missing prince. With his wit and knowledge, the man manages to get them into Orion's court and soon gains power that he could previously only dream of. Determined more than ever to get everything he ever wanted, Zaan wages a war against the whole world.

Adcock was born in London to cigar manufacturer George Charles Adcock and Mary, n√©e Goodwin. The family moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1848, where George became a bookseller in Richmond. By 1865, William was a shopkeeper at Gaffney's Creek. On 30 December 1865, he married Emma Sharples, and in 1871, he was appointed editor of the Richmond Free Press. In 1872, he and his family moved to Palmerston (later Darwin) in the Northern Territory, where Adcock ran a general store. In 1874, he stood, unsuccessfully, for election as a councillor for Palmerston, and after his wife's health became an issue in 1878, he returned to Melbourne. Following his successors' failure, Adcock returned to the territory in partnership with his brother and V. V. Brown. He opened new branches in Palmerston and Derby, and extended his business to include steamship agencies and the local Victoria Hotel, although Adcock himself remained based in Melbourne. In 1885, he returned to the territory to deal with financial difficulties brought on by the failure of the South Australian Town and Country Bank, which led to his being declared insolvent in February 1888. Adcock's appeal, reversed by the Supreme Court of South Australia, but twice reinstated, was ultimately refused in December in a proceeding unique in South Australian legal history. Adcock went to Adelaide on his solicitor's advice and was arrested on 20 December and sent to prison, where he and his counsel, Josiah Symon, continued his dispute with the insolvency court. Adcock spent four years in prison and was ultimately discharged in November 1893, but his assets were liable to be seized if he ever returned to South Australia. Adcock returned to Victoria and journalism before travelling to Coolgardie, Western Australia, in 1900, where he established mining interests. In 1912, he published a compilation of anonymous articles he had attributed to the Australian Journal on the gold rushes in the 1890s, titled The Gold Rush of the Fifties. He was appointed editor of the journal around 1910, and continued in the position until 1926. He died at his home in Kew in 1926, survived by his second wife, Annie Mary Bowcott, whom he had married on 25 April 1898.

It is the fourth and final book in The Lunar Chronicles series and the sequel to Cress. The story is loosely based on the fairy tale of \\"Snow White\\", similar to its predecessors Cinder, Scarlet and Cress which were loosely based on \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and \\"Rapunzel\\" respectively. It was a USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestselling novel. Plot Due to Princess Winter's refusal to use the Lunar gift, the ability to manipulate what others see and do, she has Lunar sickness, a state of mental illness that causes occasional hallucinations. Despite having scars on her face (suspected to be the work of Winter's evil stepmother, Queen Levana), Princess Winter is known for both her stunning beauty and the kindness she shows towards her people. Her relationship with her stepmother Levana is strained at best, especially as Winter is secretly in love with her childhood friend Jacin, who is Winter's royal guard. Meanwhile, Prince Kai has been sent back to Earth after being kidnapped and recruited by Cinder and is now part of the plan to overthrow Queen Levana. The Crew sneaks onto Kai's ship as he heads for Luna for the wedding. They are noticed by Levana and she locks down the Ports and they barely make it away, forced to leave Cress behind as she secures their getaway by hacking the security systems. She hides behind a crate and is spotted by Winter. Winter puts on a show and manages to smuggle Cress into a crate without being spotted. Winter convinces Jacin to keep Cress safe in the guard dormitories. Jacin has managed to stay alive by lying about his time on the ship with Cinder and offers the queen enough information about the blocking chip Cinder's adoptive father designed, she punishes him with lashings, but he lives. She then places him on Winter's personal guard to \\"keep her in line\\". He does his best to ignore her, but she eventually convinces him. When Winter refuses to marry the queen's thaumaturge Aimery, Levana believes she is of no more use. After Queen Levana orders Jacin to murder Winter, Jacin finds Winter in her personal menagerie. He explains the queen's orders, kisses Winter, and then stabs Winter's favorite pet‚Äîa wolf named Ryu‚Äîall so Winter can escape unharmed, and Queen Levana will believe she is dead. (Cress had planned to go with Winter and Scarlet but realized she was needed to stay behind to secure the way for Scarlet and Winter). Scarlet is given a pod key and a knife by Jacin and told to find RM9, Wolf's home Sector, and the two manage to escape with the help of Cress. Cinder, Thorne, Iko, and Wolf have made it to RM9, and have taken refuge with Maha, Wolf's mother. They snuck into the mining center easily and unrecognized. Wolf scents Scarlet and the group reunites. Thorne, Iko, and Wolf break into a control room, Thorne disguised as a guard. Cinder then uses the program made by Cress to hack into all the sectors to display her video proclaiming to be Princess Selene and asking for the people to become her army. When RM9 begins to take over the guards, intending to kill them, she runs out to stop them. This lets Levana find her, and she sends her guards and thaumaturges to RM9. In the confrontation, Cinder gives herself up, Wolf is taken, and Maha is murdered by Aimery for having housed them. Winter and Iko are attacked at Maha's Home, and two thaumaturges are killed, one by Kinney, a guard who decides to protect Winter from Jericho who decides he wants to \\"play with her\\", although Winter is injured in her head during the altercation. Jacin and Cress are informed by Kinney that Jacin is in trouble for not killing Winter. He tells Cress it's time to leave, and they maneuver through train tunnels. The group separates, Scarlet and Winter going into the lava tubes, to find the wolf-like mutations of human soldiers in an attempt to convince them to join Cinder's army, while Captain Thorne and Iko hurry to try and save Cinder and Wolf, picking up Jacin and Cress after an uneasy encounter at a train station. Kai receives Cinder's robotic finger right before the wedding as a wedding present, letting Kai worry as to whether she is dead or captured. Levana and Kai's wedding goes off without interruption, although Kai does take a pair of scissors and stabs Levana's arm, stating he won't be controlled and won't submit. He is pleased to see she can be hurt. At the wedding dinner, the entertainment is the Trial of Pearl, Adri and Cinder (Pearl and Adri having been brought to Luna for \\"aiding\\" Cinder in kidnapping Kai by using their stolen tickets). Levana is more interested in Garan's invention, although Adri knows nothing. She decides to keep them as pets. During Cinder's \\"trial\\", Cinder stops fighting her Cyborg eye sight and decides to record Levana without her glamour. Levana's true face is disfigured, with burn scar tissue on the left side of her face and hand. Cinder announces to the room, and live-feeds to Luna, that she is Princess Selene, and that Levana is a traitor to the crown for trying to murder her as a baby. Levana loses control of the guards for a second and Cinder takes control. In the battle, which is being viewed throughout Luna still, all of the thaumaturges are killed, most of the guards controlled by Cinder are slain, and the wolf soldiers have attacked anyone they could get. Cinder dives off the tower into the lake. Her systems are damaged and she almost drowns but is saved by Thorne and Jacin. Levana, in a bid to quell the uprising from the disastrous trail, announces Cinder is dead with a fake body to prove it. Cinder, Jacin, Thorne, Iko, and Cress take up refuge in an old mansion, fixing Cinder to the best of their abilities. They raid the closets for a disguise outfit for Cress and Thorne, who will sneak into the coronation. Meanwhile, Scarlet and Winter find the wolf soldiers, and they barely convince them not to eat them. However, the soldiers realize that Winter has sacrificed part of her sanity in a vow to never use Lunar manipulation again. When Levana's thaumaturges arrive, alerted to Winter's presence, they make wrong moves by insulting the soldiers and are killed. The soldiers decide to join Winter and Scarlet and go topside to find supporters to rally. Once arriving in a lumber sector, an old crone, who is Levana in disguise, offers Winter a sour-apple petite, Winter's favorite candy. However, the petite is laced with letumosis (currently the most serious and incurable plague, mutated strain from Erland), and Winter faints. After Scarlet tries to help, she gets infected too. Many soldiers are also infected just by being around them. Winter is put into a suspension tank. Wolf wakes up after being transformed into a \\"mostly-wolf\\" soldier. A thaumaturge gives him food, only to punish him as he tries to take it to teach him obedience. His memories seem to be tampered with and has vague, twisted memories of Scarlet. He is placed on Levana's Guard for the coronation ceremony. During Levana's coronation, Cinder, Jacin and Iko break into the labs that house all shells, in comatose states, to steal the letumosis cure. They become trapped in the room with all of the antidotes, and Iko gives a distraction to a thaumaturge and guards so that Jacin and Cinder can get out the vials. They transport the vials to LW-12, where Winter and Scarlet are. All but seven of the infected get the cure, those seven dying before they could be helped, and Jacin pulls Winter out of the suspension tank to give her hers. Cress and Thorne go to the coronation at the palace. As they attempt to sneak into the control room, they are stopped in the hallway by a Lunar woman. After the Lunar woman manipulates Thorne to kiss her and say he loves her, Cress is heartbroken. Hearing guards, they run and hide in a dark garden-like room. Cress is still upset, and admits her frustration with Thorne never seeing her as he does other girls. He proceeds to kiss her, and tells her that the girl must have glamoured herself to look like Cress, because he thought he was kissing her. They get interrupted by guards (who fail to recognize them) and move on. They are spotted by guards as they hurry down a hallway, and Thorne distracts them while Cress hides in a closet. They get separated and Cress wills herself to keep going. Thorne is captured. Cress continues to the Security Center. She finds Kai in a hallway, who helps her by distracting a guard (he asks to be let into a vault) so she can pass. She successfully gets in with help from Kai (who also gave her his portscreen), and loads Cinder's recording as well as unlocks the correct sectors for the revolting sectors can riot but gets trapped inside. Jacin and Winter are to go in the terrain-speeder to already revolting sectors to rally. Cinder starts a revolution. She goes down to the gates to meet everyone, where Cress has successfully opened the gates. They swarm around the front of the palace. Levana has just been crowned empress when Wolf attacks her and Cinder's message distracts everyone (Cinder is not in the room). Though he fails to kill her, he slices her neck. He is then forced to act as her guard/shield. They go down to the front gates to meet Cinder and her people. Cinder is taken down quickly as her cyborg brain has not been working since the fall and cannot fight off Levana's control. Iko shoots at the queen, who ducks and it hits Wolf. When the queen's true face (previously recorded by Cinder) is revealed in a new message, she loses control and runs into the palace. A fight ensues, and Cinder and Iko struggle (Wolf attacks Iko). Cinder and Iko (who is severely injured) hurry into the palace in search of Levana. They find Kinney outside of the coronation room (he tells Cinder to try the throne room), and Cinder sends him and Iko in to help Kai. Nobody is left in the room aside from Lunars, and they are told Kai is headed to the ports with the Earthens (after forcing the Lunars to help him with his bomb threat). They go down the servant halls and find Kai, and Kinney offers to be a pilot. Cress is found and offers the guard and technician a chance to switch sides when they detect Kai's ships, ones with bombs capable of destroying the domes. Aimery attacks Jacin and Winter, when she is almost forced to strangle Jacin, Scarlet and Wolf come. Winter claims Scarlet before Aimery can and forces her to stab Aimery. Jacin tackles Scarlet to make her stop once Aimery is dead. Winter's mind can't handle Lunar manipulation after refusing to use the gift for so long and shuts down, and she goes completely insane. Cinder proceeds to find Levana, who has Thorne in the throne room, tied up by the balcony. Every step forward Cinder takes, Thorne is forced to take one back. Levana tells Cinder that Cinder's mother, Queen Channary, forced Levana to set her face on fire as a child and made her this way. She then demands Cinder relinquish all claims to the throne or she kills Thorne. When Thorne calls her bluff, Levana has him jump, with Cinder catching him at the last moment. They wrestle and Thorne is about to shoot (under Levana's control) Cinder when Cress comes and shoots it out of his hand, hitting his hand. Still being controlled by Levana, Thorne stabs Cress in the stomach. As Cinder is distracted with trying to kill Levana, Throne stabs Cinder in the thigh (apologizing to everyone the entire time). Scarlet and Wolf show up, Scarlet gets controlled by Levana and Cinder is forced to knock her out. Wolf rushes to her aid and as the only one not able to be controlled, helps Scarlet and Cress. Levana and Cinder battle it out, both turning their own guns on themselves. Levana feigns penance, then stabs Cinder in the chest, who in turn shoots her. Levana dies, while Cinder survives due to being a cyborg. Wolf and Scarlet reaffirm their feelings for each other, Thorne and Cress officially become a couple, while Jacin kisses a recovering Winter awake, later hinting at his feelings. Amidst all this, Cinder agrees to sign the Treaty of Bremen with Earth, thus symbolizing a true alliance between Earth and Luna, and is crowned Queen of Luna. She talks to Kai about abdicating the throne and establishing Luna as a republic, and he gives her her old cyborg foot, and asks if she would want to be his Empress. Cinder replies she'll consider it, and drops the foot, a reminder of the past when she was scorned, into the palace lake. Development Winter took Meyer two years to complete and at times she thought that she \\"would never be finished\\" and that she \\"would be stuck in this book for the rest of my life.\\" Part of the reason for this was due to Meyer putting the book to the side while she worked on the novel Fairest, which she wanted to work on in order to further develop the character of Levana. While the character of Winter was initially planned to physically resemble the typical image of Snow White, she chose to make her black after seeing a photo of a \\"beautiful black model biting into a red apple\\" and thinking \\"That‚Äôs her! That‚Äôs my princess!\\" Reception Critical reception has been positive and Winter has received positive reviews from the School Library Journal and Publishers Weekly. Booklist gave Winter a favorable review, praising Meyer for inserting \\"just enough veiled references to the original stories to spur intellectual and emotional connections.\\"  References  External links * Category:2015 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Children's science fiction novels Category:Young adult fantasy novels Category:Works based on Snow White Category:Cyborgs in literature Category:2015 science fiction novels Category:Novels based on fairy tales Category:Novels by Marissa Meyer ","title":"Winter (Meyer novel)"},{"id":"33672266","text":"Garab-e Olya or Garrab-e Olya () may refer to: * Garrab-e Olya, Kermanshah * Garab-e Olya, Khuzestan * Garab-e Olya, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad * Garab-e Olya, Lorestan * Garab-e Olya, alternate name of Garab Kuchek, Lorestan Province ","title":"Garab-e Olya"},{"id":"33672286","text":"Belo Miguel Cipriani (born June 21, 1980 in Guatemala) is a gay, blind and Latino writer in San Francisco.

It is a listed building, used as a training centre for E Squadron, 205 (Scottish) Field Hospital (Volunteers). Early years The building was originally part of a planned waterside development by the Duke of Buccleuch in the late 1830s and was completed in 1938. The site was important as it fronted onto the new pier. The design is attributed to William Burn by John Gifford, Colin McWilliam and David Walker in Edinburgh, although previous descriptions state that it was designed by John Henderson. It is a 3-storey building with a basement. It is symmetrical and rectangular-plan in the classical tradition. The exterior is coursed, tooled sandstone with ashlar dressings; decorative features include band courses above and below piano nobile, V-jointed angle quoins, eaves cornice and architraved windows. There is a Doric entrance porch on the west side. Cast-iron torchere lamp standards with nautical finials flank the entrance. Service history On the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the navy took over the Granton Hotel, close to Granton Harbour and commissioned it as HMS Claverhouse for Reserve training. From April 1940 it was in use for Merchant Navy Defence Courses, and also served as the headquarters for the Motor Launches of the local Coastal Forces. Decommissioned on 15 August 1945, Claverhouse then became the Training Centre of the Forth Division. It was also a drill ship until 1958. Current use The principal elevations are largely unaltered and retain a number of early/original fixtures and fittings, including the main entrance and lamp standards. The building, including the lamp standards, has been a category B listed building since 1970. The building is known as the \\"Claverhouse Training Centre\\" and is the HQ for E Squadron, 205 (Scottish) Field Hospital (Volunteers), No.17 (Granton) Platoon, Army Cadet Force and the Edinburgh Trinity Sea Cadets.

Jones was born in Plymouth, Devon, England, to Welsh tailor John Jones and Elizabeth, n√©e Tucker, becoming a tailor like his father. He became involved in radical and temperance causes and vigorously opposed Roman Catholicism. He married Anne Letitia Angear at Devonport in 1850, and in 1851 the couple migrated to Melbourne where Jones continued to work as a tailor until 1862. He was elected to Melbourne City Council in 1862 and remained until October 1865, his activism against Premier John O'Shanassy's \\"Irish ministry\\" led him to be associated with the protectionists despite his earlier free trade leanings. In 1864, having been persuaded by the Orange Order to stand for the Victorian Parliament, he was elected to the seat of Ballarat East as a supporter of James McCulloch, and was appointed government whip. Jones' wife died on 3 June 1863, and he remarried on 17 February 1865 to Charlotte Ryan. Appointed literary editor of the Ballarat Evening Post in 1867, he had defected to the Opposition in October 1866 after being disappointed in his hopes for a ministry; he later returned to McCulloch but lost his seat at the 1868 election. During the Darling grant crisis he was re-elected to the parliament, defeating the lands minister William Vale in a ministerial by-election for Ballarat West and joining the opposition to Charles Sladen's government. In July, with McCulloch's return to government, he was appointed commissioner of roads and railways and vice-president of the Board of Lands and Works. He quickly became embroiled in a series of court cases and inquiries resulting from his involvement in corrupt land operations; despite resigning his seat and winning re-election in March 1869, he was expelled from the Assembly in April and re-elected again by his constituents. He lost his seat in 1871 after his support was split by a large field of candidates. Jones' marriage fell apart in 1872 and after an unsuccessful court case in which he tried to marry Rebecca Einley he travelled to America, where he worked as a journalist and lecturer, living in Utah and Wisconsin. He returned to Victoria in 1881 and attempted to re-enter politics, failing at a by-election for Geelong in 1882 and for Ballarat West at the 1883 election before winning the seat in 1886. Running for Windermere in 1889 he was decisively defeated, losing again in 1892 for East Bourke Boroughs, after which he moved to Western Australia to work as a librarian. He continued his political efforts, running for Fremantle in the first federal election in 1901 with disappointing results. He returned to Ballarat in 1902 and died at Korumburra in 1903.

It began after a small group of Apaches killed a freight wagon operator, near the San Carlos Reservation, and was part of the larger Apache campaign, beginning in 1889, to round up Apaches who had left the reservations. The American army fought a skirmish with the Apaches near Globe, Arizona, at the mouth of Cherry Creek, which resulted in the deaths of two hostiles and the capture of the remaining three. Two men received the Medal of Honor for their service during the campaign.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=28593United States Congress, pg. 162-168 Background Following Geronimo's final surrender in September 1886, the majority of the Apache people were sent to either Florida or Alabama as prisoners of war. Only a few companies of Apache Scouts and some small bands of hostiles remained in the southwest. One of the Apaches was the famous Indian scout known as the Apache Kid. After leaving the army in 1887, the Apache Kid was arrested near Globe, Arizona in 1889 and sentenced to several years in the Yuma Territorial Prison for the attempted murder of Albert Sieber, the chief of the Apache scouts. However, during the transfer to Yuma, the Apache Kid and a handful of his followers escaped police custody and killed two people in what has been called the Kelvin Grade Massacre. In response, the United States Army launched an operation to catch the Apache Kid and the other Apaches who were out raiding across southern Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico. The Kid and his gang were not the only Apaches operating off the reservation. There were several other small bands causing mischief, most notably that of Massai. Another former Apache scout, Massai is suspected of being responsible for a number of deaths in Arizona that were often attributed to the Apache Kid. But even after Massai there were others. On March 2, 1890, a group of five \\"drunken\\" Apaches killed a wagon driver named Herbert and stole two large horses, about ten miles west of Fort Thomas and the San Carlos reservation. At the time, Fort Thomas was home to Troop K of the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers, under the command of Lieutenant Powhatan Clarke, a Medal of Honor recipient who fought in Geronimo's War.http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-91925-print.htmlUnited States Congress, pg. 162-168Robinson, pg. 74 Campaign As soon as the army learned of the ambush, Lieutenant Clarke was ordered by the Department of Arizona's commander, Major General Benjamin Grierson, to take ten men \\"into the field\\" on an expedition where \\"every possible effort [was] made to capture or destroy the murderers.\\" At the site of the ambush, the cavalrymen joined Lieutenant James Watson, 10th Cavalry, a small force of 4th Cavalry, and some Apache scouts. From there the scouts discovered hoofprints and a trail leading to the northwest towards the Salt River. According to General Grierson, they \\"persistently followed [the trail] for several days and nights over the rough, broken mountains and plains of Arizona.\\" Eventually the cavalrymen and the Apache scouts were running low on rations so they were supplied with a cow, some coffee and some salt by a generous rancher. Some time after that, Sergeant Alexander Cheatham, I Troop, 10th Cavalry, led reinforcements, a wagon and several mules, packed with food, to the expedition from San Carlos after a nighttime march of forty-five miles. A veteran of the American Civil War, and over twenty years on the frontier, Sergeant Cheatham was able to track Lieutenants Clarke and Watson's men over rugged desert and mountain terrain in the dark. The expedition finally caught up with the Apaches in a canyon of the Salt River on March 7, approximately 200 miles from Fort Thomas and about thirty miles northeast of Globe. After entering the canyon, the terrain became very rough so the hostiles killed their horses and continued fleeing on foot. For the same reason the Apache scouts were ordered to dismount and go ahead of the cavalry to try and draw the hostiles into battle.United States Congress, pg. 162-168Schubert, pg. 102-106 The pursuit through the canyon was so dangerous that at some points the scouts had to lie down and crawl through the narrow passages to trace the hostile Apaches' footprints. The cavalrymen waited down at the river to water the horses but, at about 12:00 pm, the scouts made contact with the fugitives, near the mouth of Cherry Creek. Lieutenants Clarke and Watson heard the firing from the river and immediately they proceeded towards the sound. Clarke recalled that he felt \\"a calm chill looking for a live Indian with a gun down in one of these great canyons.\\" Not long after that, the cavalrymen were under fire and they assisted the scouts in trapping the hostiles within a \\"three-sided tangle of boulders.\\" The Apache fugitives put up a \\"hard fight\\" but were eventually forced to retreat into a \\"shallow cave\\" as the expedition surrounded and moved in on their position. In the cave the hostiles were safe from direct fire so \\"one of the sergeants, an excellent shot,\\" began \\"firing against a rock almost in front of their cave, thereby splatter[ing] lead and splintered rock in their faces.\\" When the soldiers and the scouts closed to within fifty yards of the cave's entrance, they prepared to make a charge but the Apaches decided to surrender, having lost three killed or wounded out of five men.United States Congress, pg. 162-168Schubert, pg. 102-106 Aftermath Four men from the 10th Cavalry, 4th Cavalry, and the Apache scouts received either \\"official recognition\\" or medals from the army for their involvement in the skirmish. Sergeant William McBryar of the 10th Cavalry, Sergeant Rowdy of the Apache scouts, and Sergeant James T. Daniels of the 4th Cavalry were awarded the Medal of Honor. McBryar received his for \\"coolness, bravery and marksmanship,\\" he and Rowdy were the last Medal of Honor recipients for service during the Apache Wars. General Grierson later said; \\"This [skirmish] is one of the most brilliant affairs of its kind that has occurred in recent years and has had a very quieting effect upon, and will no doubt prove a lasting lesson to, the Indians of the San Carlos Agency. It was, therefore, extremely gratifying to congratulate the commanding officers of San Carlos and Fort Thomas, and especially Lieutenants Watson and Clarke and the troops under their command for the persistent pursuit and complete success. Such service in the execution of duty merits the highest praise and affords an excellent example of what promptness and indefatigable exertion may accomplish in the face of almost insurmountable obstacles. It was recommended that substantial recognition be promptly awarded in the way of brevets to the officers and medals to the enlisted men who took part in the engagement.\\" Though five Apaches had been captured, the army's campaign against other off reservation Apaches continued because the Apache Kid was still at large. On March 10, just three days after the Cherry Creek engagement, General Grierson \\"authorized the arrest and removal of seventy-six Indians, relatives and friends of Kid and other Apaches, who were known to be in sympathy with the fugitives.\\" General Grierson reported that he \\"did this as a measure of precaution and asked that [his] action be approved by the honorable Secretary of War, that proper arrangements might be made for their care and sustenance at Fort Union to which post they were sent under suitable guard. Since the arrival of Indian prisoners at Fort Union, in accordance with instructions received from Washington, twelve Indian children were selected from among them, and sent to the Kamona Indian school at Santa Fe, N. Mex.\\" The rest eventually went to live at Mount Vernon Barracks, in Alabama, with other Apache prisoners.United States Congress, pg. 162-168Schubert, pg. 102-106Robinson, pg. 74 See also *Skeleton Canyon shootout *Cherry Creek ruins *Apache‚ÄìMexico Wars References  Category:Conflicts in 1890 Category:1890 in Arizona Territory Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Battles involving the Apache Category:19th-century military history of the United States Category:History of Arizona Category:Apache Wars Category:March 1890 events ","title":"Cherry Creek campaign"},{"id":"33672481","text":"Hitler Didi (English: literally Hitler Sister but figuratively Auntie Hitler) is a daily Indian soap opera that aired on Zee TV.

Early life He was born in Melbourne to saddler John Dinwoodie and Janet, n√©e McFarlane. He was sent to a private tutor in England before travelling to Rockhampton with the intention to become a pastoralist. He instead became a gold miner at the Calliope gold rush and moved to Gympie in 1867, where he became a magistrate under the name John Hamilton. He also practiced as a doctor despite his lack of qualifications, and in 1877 was a surgeon to the hospital at the Hodgkinson gold rush, where he attracted publicity with a public dispute with the local warden and a successful defamation case after allegations that he seduced the daughter of a friend of the local editor. Politics In 1878 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Gympie and supported Thomas McIlwraith's conservative group. In 1883 he changed seat to Cook, winning the election amid allegations of vote rigging. Hamilton supported the North Queensland separatist movement and continued to support McIlwraith's conservative successors, becoming a significant but occasionally rebellious backbencher, successfully opposing the attempted reduction of parliamentary salaries in 1893 and defeating the nomination of Alfred Cowley as Speaker in 1899. In 1903 he lost his post as government whip and in 1904 lost his seat to a Labour candidate.

History  The title was bestowed upon Afonso de Albuquerque, the second Viceroy of India, by the Portuguese King Manoel I in 1515 as a reward for his outstanding performance for the Portuguese Empire. This was the first ducal title granted outside the Royal family and the first title that refers to land overseas. The Casa Ducal de Goa was the most important and richest of noble houses of its time in the sixteenth century, shortly behind the ducal houses on the Crown and the House of Braganza. Having no legitimate children, Afonso de Albuquerque, before leaving for his term as governor in India, provided for the legitimacy of his only natural son Br√°s de Albuquerque, which was granted by the Crown in 1506. In India, he wrote to ask King Manuel I that all the honors for himself deserved to be granted to his son Br√°s de Albuquerque, instituting him as his sole heir. Before the death of Afonso de Albuquerque in 1515, the King showered honors and riches on Br√°s de Albuquerque, granting him the Duchy of Goa and the title of Dom, although determining that Afonso would add to his baptismal name in honor of former Viceroy. The title and house would soon become extinct with Afonso's son, Br√°s de Albuquerque, who would die without male heirs. A law at time, the , meant that property of the crown could only be inherited by the first-born male heir. In the nineteenth century, by the decree of 19 May 1886, King Lu√≠s I created the Duchy of Albuquerque in favour of D. Jo√£o Afonso Macedo de Sousa Costa, 2nd Earl of Mesquitela, naming the ducal title Albuquerque in honor of the family representation of Afonso de Albuquerque held by that noble (as a descendant in a straight line daughter of D.

Operations The mine produces high-grade oxide ore that was transported to Zambia for processing at the SX/EW facility in Bwana. Both the mine and the Bwana Mkubwa facility away were owned by First Quantum Minerals (FQM). In January 2003 FQM announced an increase in estimated reserves from 295,000 tonnes to 356,000 tonnes of contained copper. In 2006 the mine produced about 520,000 tonnes of ore grading 10.3% copper, and copper cathode production was 51,068 tonnes. Controversy In December 2007 Moise Katumbi, the governor of Katanga province, ordered First Quantum Minerals to stop exporting copper ore from the Lonshi mine to Zambia. The stoppage was related to a dispute over contract terms. In May 2010 a Congolese court ruled that FQM's Lonshi and Frontier copper mines had been awarded illegally and that they should revert to state- owned Sodimico. According to FQM the cancellation of their licenses was due to FQM's decision to contest the expropriation of their Kolwezi tailings project, which was later sold to the Kazakh mining company Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation. FQM's share of the properties was transferred first to Sodimico, then to Sodifor, a joint venture between Sodimico and Fortune Ahead, a shell company listed in Hong Kong with Saul Valt as the sole registered director. In August 2011 the Bloomberg news agency reported that Sodimico had sold its 30% share in the Frontier and Lonshi mines for under than one sixteenth of their estimated value.

The farming systems that significantly contribute to the agriculture of India are subsistence farming, organic farming, industrial farming.\\"India's Role in World Agriculture.\\" Monitoring Agricultural trade Policy. European Commission, December 2007. Regions throughout India differ in types of farming they use; some are based on horticulture, ley farming, agroforestry, and many more. Due to India's geographical location, certain parts experience different climates, thus affecting each region's agricultural productivity differently. India is very dependent on its monsoon cycle for large crop yields. India's agriculture has an extensive background which goes back to at least 9 thousand years. In India, Agriculture was established throughout most of the subcontinent by 6000‚Äì5000 BP. During the 5th millennium BP, in the alluvial plains of the Indus River in Pakistan, the old cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa experienced an apparent establishment of an organized farming urban culture. That society, known as the Harappan or Indus civilization, flourished until shortly after 4000 BP; it was much more comprehensive than those of Egypt or Babylonia and appeared earlier than analogous societies in northern China. Currently, the country holds the second position in agricultural production in the world. In 2007, agriculture and other industries made up more than 16% of India's GDP. Despite the steady decline in agriculture's contribution to the country's GDP, agriculture is the biggest industry in the country and plays a key role in the socio-economic growth of the country. India is the second- largest producer of wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, silk, groundnuts, and dozens more. It is also the second biggest harvester of vegetables and fruit, representing 8.6% and 10.9% of overall production, respectively. The major fruits produced by India are mangoes, papayas, sapota, and bananas. India also has the biggest number of livestock in the world, holding 281 million. In 2008, the country housed the second largest number of cattle in the world with 175 million.Krishna, K. L., and Uma Kapila (eds) (2009). Readings in Indian Agriculture and Industry. Darya Ganj, New Delhi: Academic Foundation. Climate effect on farming systems Each region in India has a specific soil and climate that is only suitable for certain types of farming. Many regions on the western side of India experience less than 50 cm of rain annually, so the farming systems are restricted to cultivate crops that can withstand drought conditions and farmers are usually restricted to single cropping. Gujarat, Rajasthan, South Punjab, and northern Maharashtra all experience this climate and each region grows such suitable crops like jowar, bajra, and peas. In contrast, the eastern side of India has an average of 100‚Äì200 cm of rainfall annually without irrigation, so these regions have the ability to double crop. West Coast, West Bengal, parts of Bihar, U.P. and Assam are all associated with this climate and they grow crops such as rice, sugarcane, jute, and many more. Climate Regions of India There are three different types of crops that are cultivated throughout India. Each type is grown in a different season depending on their compatibility with certain weather. Kharif crops are grown at the start of the monsoon until the beginning of the winter, relatively from June to November. Examples of such crops are rice, corn, millet, groundnut, moong, and urad. Rabi crops are winter crops that are sown in October -November months and harvested in February - March. Its typical examples are wheat, boro paddy, jowar, nuts, etc. The third type is Zaid crops which are summer crops. It is sown in February - March and harvested in May - June. Its examples are aush paddy, vegetables, jute, etc. Irrigation farming Irrigation farming is when crops are grown with the help of irrigation systems by supplying water to land through rivers, reservoirs, tanks, and wells. Over the last century, the population of India has tripled. With a growing population and increasing demand for food, the necessity of water for agricultural productivity is crucial. India faces the daunting task of increasing its food production by over 50 percent in the next two decades, and reaching towards the goal of sustainable agriculture requires a crucial role of water. Empirical evidence suggests that the increase in agricultural production in India is mostly due to irrigation; close to three-fifths of India's grain harvest comes from irrigated land. The land area under irrigation expanded from 22.6 million hectares in FY 1950 to 59 million hectares in FY 1990. The main strategy for these irrigation systems focuses on public investments in surface systems, such as large dams, long canals, and other large-scale works that require large amounts of capital. Between 1951 and 1990, nearly 1,350 large- and medium-sized irrigation works were started, and about 850 were completed. =Problems from Irrigation= Because funds and technical expertise were in short supply, many projects moved forward at a slow pace, including The Indira Gandhi Canal project. The central government's transfer of huge amounts of water from Punjab to Haryana and Rajasthan contributed to the civil unrest in Punjab during the 1980s and early 1990s. Problems also have arisen as groundwater supplies used for irrigation face depletion. Drawing water off from one area to irrigate another often leads to increased salinity receiving water through irrigation are poorly managed or inadequately designed; the result often is too much water and water-logged fields incapable of production. =Geography of irrigation in India= Irrigation farming is very important for crop cultivation in regions of seasonal or low rainfall. Western U.P., Punjab, Haryana, parts of Bihar, Orissa, A.P., Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and other regions thrive on irrigation and generally practice multiple or double cropping. With irrigation, a large variety of crops can be produced such as rice, sugarcane, wheat and tobacco.Bhaduri, Anik, Upali Amarasinghe, and Tushaar Shah. \\"Future of Irrigation in India.\\" Web. 14 October 2011 Shifting cultivation Shifting cultivation is a type of subsistence farming where a plot of land is cultivated for a few years until the crop yield declines due to soil exhaustion and the effects of pests and weeds. Once crop yield has stagnated, the plot of land is deserted and the ground is cleared by slash and burn methods, allowing the land to replenish. Crops like yarn cassava, maize, potatoes are mostly grown This type of cultivation is predominant in the eastern and north-eastern regions on hill slopes and in forest areas such as Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh. Crops such as rain-fed rice, corn, buck wheat, small millets, root crops, and vegetables are grown in this system.Ranjan, Rajiv, and V. P. Upadhyay (23 March 1999). \\"Ecological Problems Due to Shifting Cultivation.\\" ias.ac.in Eighty-five percent of the total cultivation in northeast India is by shifting cultivation. Due to the increasing requirement for cultivation of land, the cycle of cultivation followed by leaving land fallow has reduced from 25‚Äì30 years to 2‚Äì3 years. This significant drop in uncultivated land does not give the land enough time to return to its natural condition. Because of this, the resilience of the ecosystem has broken down and the land is increasingly deteriorating. =Shifting cultivation in Odisha= Odisha accounts for the largest area under shifting cultivation in India. Shifting cultivation is locally known as the podu cultivation. More than 30,000 square km of land (about 1/5 land surface of Odisha) is under such cultivation. Shifting cultivation is prevalent in Kalahandi, Koraput, Phulbani and other southern and western districts. Tribal communities such as Kondha, Kutia Kondha, Dongaria Kondha, Lanjia Sauras, and Paraja are all involved in this practice. Many festivals and other such rituals revolve around the podu fields because the tribals view podu cultivation as more than just a means of their livelihood, they view it as a way of life. In the first year of podu cultivation, tribals sow kandlan (variety of arhar dal). Sowing means spraying the seeds and is used at pre- monsoon time and the area is adequately protected. Yield differs from area to area depending on local climatic factors. After harvest, the land is left fallow. During the pre-monsoon, varieties of rice, corn, and ginger are also sown. Generally, after the third year, the tribals abandon this land and shift to new land. On the abandoned land, natural regeneration starts from the available rootstocks and seed banks. Bamboo comes up naturally; along with many other climbers that regenerate. Generally, this land is not cultivated for the next 10 years. =Impacts of shifting cultivation= Frequent shifting from one land to the other has affected the ecology of these regions. The area under natural forest has declined; the fragmentation of habitat, local disappearance of native species and invasion by exotic weeds and other plants are some of the other environmental consequences of shifting agriculture. Areas that have a fallow cycle of 5 to 10 years are more vulnerable to weed invasion compared to 15-year cycles, which have more soil nutrients, a larger variety of species, and higher agronomic yield. Commercial agriculture In a commercial based agriculture, crops are raised in large scale plantations or estates and shipped off to other countries for money. These systems are common in sparsely populated areas such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, and Maharashtra. Wheat, cotton, sugarcane, and corn are all examples of crops grown commercially.Van, Veenhuizen Ren√©. Cities Farming for the Future Urban Agriculture for Green and Productive Cities. Silang, Cavite, Philippines: International Institute of Rural Reconstruction, 2006. Print. < http://www.ruaf.org/node/961 > =Types of commercial agriculture= Intensive commercial farming: This is a system of agriculture in which relatively large amounts of capital or labor are applied to relatively smaller areas of land. It is usually practiced where the population pressure is reducing the size of landholdings. West Bengal practices intensive commercial farming. Extensive commercial farming: This is a system of agriculture in which relatively small amounts of capital or labor investment are applied to relatively large areas of land. At times, the land is left fallow to regain its fertility. It is mostly mechanized because of the cost and availability of labor. It usually occurs at the margin of the agricultural system, at a great distance from the market or on poor land of limited potential and is usually practiced in the tarai regions of southern Nepal. Crops grown are sugarcane, rice and wheat. Plantation agriculture: Plantation is a large farm or estate usually in a tropical or sub-tropical country where crops are grown for sale in distant markets rather than local consumption. Commercial grain farming: This type of farming is a response to farm mechanization and it is the major type of activity in the areas of low rainfall and low density of population where extensive farming is practiced. Crops are prone to the vagaries of weather and droughts and monoculture of wheat is the general practice. Ley farming With increases in both human and animal populations in the Indian arid zone, the demand for grain, fodder, and fuelwood is increasing. Agricultural production in this region is low due to the low and uneven distribution of rainfall (100‚Äì400 mm yr\\"1) and the low availability of essential mineral nutrients. These demands can be met only by increasing production levels of these Aridisols through the adoption of farming technologies that improve physical properties as well as the biological processes of these soils. Alternate farming systems are being sought for higher sustainable crop production at low input levels and to protect the soils from further degradation. In India's drylands, ley farming is used as a way to restore soil fertility. It involves rotations of grasses and food grains in a specific area. It is now being promoted even more to encourage organic farming, especially in the drylands.Sharma, Arun K. (2005) \\"The Potential for Organic Farming in the Drylands of India.\\" Arid Lands Newsletters. Ley farming acts as insurance against crop failures by frequent droughts. Structurally related physical properties and biological processes of soil often change when different cropping systems, tillage, or management practices are used. Soil fertility can be increased and maintained by enhancing natural soil biological processes. Farming provides balanced nutrition for sustainable production through continuous turnover of organic matter in the soil. Plantation farming This extensive commercial system is characterized by the cultivation of a single cash crop in plantations of estates on a large scale. Because it is a capital centered system, it is important to be technically advanced and have efficient methods of cultivation and tools including fertilizers and irrigation and transport facilities. Examples of this type of farming are the tea plantations in Assam and West Bengal, the coffee plantations in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, and the rubber plantations in Kerala and Maharashtra.Gulati, Ashok, P. K. Joshi, and Maurice Landes (2003). \\"Contract Farming in India: An Introduction.\\" ncap.res.in =Forestry= In contrast to a naturally regenerated forest, tree plantations are typically grown as even- aged monocultures, primarily for timber production. These plantations are also likely to contain tree species that would not naturally grow in the area. They may include unconventional types of trees such as hybrids, and genetically modified trees are likely to be used in the future. Plantation owners will grow trees that are best suited to industrial applications such as pine, spruce, and eucalyptus due to their fast growth rate, tolerance of rich or degraded agricultural land, and potential to produce large quantities of raw material for industrial use. Plantations are always young forests in ecological terms; this means that these forests don't contain the type of growth, soil or wildlife that is typical of old-growth natural ecosystems in a forest. The replacement of natural forests with tree plantations has also caused social problems. In some countries, there is little concern or regard for the rights of the local people when replacing natural forests with plantations. Because these plantations are made solely for the production of one material, there is a much smaller range of services for the local people. India has taken measures to avoid this by limiting the amount of land that can be owned by someone. As a result, smaller plantations are owned by local farmers who then sell the wood to larger companies. =Teak and bamboo= Teak and bamboo plantations in India are a good alternative crop solution to farmers of central India, where conventional farming is popular. Due to rising input costs of farming, many farmers have grown teak and bamboo plantations because they only require water during the first two years. Bamboo, once planted, provides the farmer with output for 50 years until it flowers. Production of these two trees positively impacts and contributes to the climate change problem in India.Ramesh, P., N. R. Panwar, A. B. Sing, S. Ramana, Sushil Kumar Yadav, Rahul Shrivastava, and A. Subba Rao. \\"Status of Organic Farming in India.\\" www.ias.ac.in. Crop rotation Crop rotation can be classified as a type of subsistence farming if there is an individual or communal farmer doing the labor and if the yield is solely for their own consumption. It is characterized by different crops being alternately grown on the same land in a specific order to have more effective control of weeds, pests, diseases, and more economical utilization of soil fertility. In India, leguminous crops are grown alternately with wheat, barley, and mustard. An ideal cropping system should use natural resources efficiently, provide stable and high returns, and avoid environmental damage. =Different sequences of crop rotation= Rotation of two crops within a year i.e.: :Year 1: Wheat :Year 2: Barley :Year 3: Wheat again Three crop rotation i.e.: :Year 1: Wheat :Year 2: Barley :Year 3: Mustard :Year 4: Wheat again =Pearl millet= Pearl millet crop is mostly grown as a rainfed monsoon crop during kharif (June‚ÄìJuly to September‚ÄìNovember) and also as an irrigated hot weather (February‚ÄìJune) crop in central and south India. Pearl millet is often grown in rotation with sorghum, groundnut, cotton, foxtail millet, finger millet (ragi), castor, and sometimes, in the south India, with rice. On the red and iron-rich soils of Karnataka, pearl millet and ragi rotation are practiced although pearl millet isn't always grown annually. Cluster bean ‚Äì Pearl millet crop sequence with crop residue incorporation has significantly increased the productivity in the arid zone of Western Rajasthan where Fallow ‚Äì Pearl millet/Pearl millet after Pearl millet crop sequence is practiced. In Punjab, the dryland rotation may be a small grain-millet-fallow. In irrigated lands, pearl millet is rotated with chickpea, fodder sorghum, and wheat. In the dry and light soils of Rajasthan, southern Punjab and Haryana, and northern Gujarat, pearl millet is most often rotated with a pulse-like moth or mungbean, or is followed by fallow, sesame, potato, mustard, moth bean, and guar. Sesame crop may be low- yielding and may be replaced by castor or groundnut. Dairy farming In 2001 India became the world leader in milk production with a production volume of 84 million tons. India has about three times as many dairy animals as the USA, which produces around 75 million tons. Dairy Farming is generally a type of subsistence farming system in India, especially in Haryana, the major producer of milk in the country. More than 40% of Indian farming households are engaged in milk production because it is a livestock enterprise in which they can engage with relative ease to improve their livelihoods. Regular milk sales allow them to move from subsistence to earning a market-based income. The structure of the livestock industry is globally changing and putting poorer livestock producers in danger because they will be crowded out and left behind. More than 40 million households in India are at least partially dependent on milk production, and developments in the dairy sector will have important repercussions on their livelihoods and on rural poverty levels. Haryana was chosen to assess possible developments in the Indian dairy sector and to broadly identify areas of interventions that favor small-scale dairy producers. A methodology developed by the International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) examined impacts of change on milk prices, farm management and other market factors that affect the small-scale milk production systems, the whole farm and related household income. Co-operative farming Co-operative farming refers to the pooling of farming resources such as fertilizers, pesticides, farming equipment such as tractors. It however generally excludes pooling of land unlike in collective farming where pooling of land is also done. Co-operative farming is a relatively new system in India. Its goal is to bring together all of the land resources of farmers in such an organized and united way so that they will be collected in a position to grow crops on every bit of land to the best of the fertility of the land. This system has become an essential feature of India's Five Year Plans. There is immense scope for co-operative farming in India although the movement is as yet in it infancy. The progress of co-operative financing in India has been very slow. The reasons are fear of unemployment, attachment to the land, lack of proper propaganda renunciation of membership by farmers and the existence of fake societies.

Born in Montrose, Scotland, to engineer John Strachan and Sarah, n√©e Delarne, Strachan's family moved to England in 1853 where he studied engineering before running away to sea, fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, sailing on the trade routes from India to Japan, whaling in the Arctic, advising the Prince of Higo in Japan, and managing guano workings on Baker Island. He arrived in Tasmania on 25 April 1872 as mate of the Rita, and on 3 March 1875 married Alice Sarah Henrietta Plummer at Launceston. He worked at Bird Island in the Coral Sea managing more guano workings and visited Torres Strait in September 1875. Subsequently Strachan established himself in Sydney before becoming New Guinea correspondent for the Age, embarking on an exploratory trip down the Mai Kassa River on 6 May 1884 which resulted in considerable fighting with the indigenous people and the death of one of Strachan's companions; his use of an improvised torpedo provoked widespread condemnation in Sydney. He went on another expedition to the Mai Kassa and the Gulf of Papua in September but in January 1886 his claim of discovery was disallowed for 500,000 acres of the area he explored. In 1887 he appealed to the Colonial Office, which dismissed his claim as \\"excitable and rather ignorant\\". After exploring McClure's Gulf in 1887 from a base in Cape York he published Explorations and Adventures in New Guinea in 1888, which was poorly received by geographers. He based himself in Sydney again in 1889 and established trading operations in Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. He successfully sued the Launceston Daily Telegraph in 1896 for ¬£2000 after it published a story about his early life. Strachan ran unsuccessfully for the New South Wales Parliament against Billy Hughes in 1898 (he appears as \\"Captain Alistair\\" in Hughes' 1947 book Crusts and Crusades), but in November 1902 was imprisoned for debt in North Borneo. In 1903 he again tried to enter politics, this time running against Joseph Cook for the federal seat of Parramatta without success. He unsuccessfully sued the Commonwealth in 1906 for detention of his ship at Daru in Papua, and was charged with illegal recruiting by the Germans in New Guinea in 1909. He subsequently retired, although he was active in anti-German organisations during World War I and ran for the state seat of Parramatta in 1917, garnering only 26 votes. He died in Sydney of chronic cystitis in 1922.

Menge is an American ocean ecologist. He has spent over forty years studying the processes that drive the dynamics of natural communities. His fields of interest include: structure and dynamics of marine meta-ecosystems, responses of coastal ecosystems to climate change, linking benthic and inner shelf pelagic communities, the relationship between scale and ecosystem dynamics, bottom-up and top-down control of community structure, recruitment dynamics, ecophysiology and sub-organismal mechanisms in environmental stress models, larval transport and connectivity, impact of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, controls of productivity, population, community, and geographical ecology. He settled on two career goals: carrying out experiment- based field research to investigate the dynamics of rocky intertidal communities, focusing on species interactions and environmental context and how this might shape a community, and using the resulting data to test and modify theories on how communities were organized.  Early life and schooling  Menge was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota and grew up mostly in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Minnesota, 1961-1965. He then received his PhD from the Department of Zoology, University of Washington, Seattle, 1965‚Äì1970, working under guidance of Robert T. Paine. Menge met Jane Lubchenco and they were married in 1971. Menge worked on his Postdoc between 1970-1971 at the University of California at Santa Barbara with Joe Connell and Bill Murdoch. Menge then accepted a position as Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston in August 1971, where he remained until 1976. Menge then moved to Oregon and took a job at Oregon State University (OSU) in September 1976, where he has worked as an assistant, associate, and full professor.  Research  The research that Menge has been interested in includes: marine ecology, community ecology, ecosystem and meta-ecosystem ecology; physiological ecology; geographical ecology; impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on coastal ecosystems. Menge has researched the dynamics of ecological communities in biologically diverse marine environments. His visiting professorships have taken him to Guam, Sweden, Quebec, Chile, Jamaica, New Zealand and Panama, where he has been an associate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute since 1978.  Involvements  Menge serves on the board of directors of the Friday Harbor Laboratories, the West Quoddy Biological Research Station, the Organization for Tropical Studies, and the Sustainable Ecosystems Institute. He has been a reviewer for the Journal of Marine Research since 1989. Menge is also a member of the American Society of Naturalists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, the Ecological Society of America, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography and the Nordic Ecological Society. He has authored 121 papers published or in press.  Current work  Menge and his wife, both faculty members at Oregon State University, split a single professorship into two half-time positions. Each holds an endowed title as Wayne and Gladys Valley Professor of Marine Biology. For the next five years, they will focus their expertise on a $17.7 million research project to study the ecology and conservation of coastal Pacific Ocean marine life. Over the next five years, the research goals of PISCO are to understand the impacts of climate change on large marine ecosystems, to further the theory and application of marine reserves, and to help inform the sustainable management of marine resources.  Awards and honors  Menge is a marine ecologist. He received an honorary Doctor of Science degree during commencement ceremonies on Sunday, May 23 at Southampton College of Long Island University. Menge was appointed Wayne and Gladys Valley Endowed Professor of Marine Biology. He was awarded OSU Distinguished Professor of Zoology. He has won OSU's F.A. Gilfillan Memorial Award for Excellence in Research, the George Mercer Award from the Ecological Society of America, and fellowships from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.

Mississippi State player in the 1963 regional semifinal Rouse, a 6'7\\" forward from Pearl High School in Nashville, Tennessee, played college basketball for Loyola for coach George Ireland. He, along with high school teammate Les Hunter, joined the Ramblers and helped them become the first NCAA champion to feature four African- American starters in his junior year. Rouse anchored the middle, leading the team in rebounding as a sophomore (11.3 per game) and junior (12.1 per game). In the championship season of 1962‚Äì63, Rouse averaged 13.5 points. Rouse is best known for following Hunter's miss as time expired to defeat Cincinnati and spoil that school's bid to win a third straight NCAA title. The shot gave Loyola its first, and so far only, NCAA basketball championship. Rouse and the four other Loyola starters played the entire championship game, without substitution.2010-11 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball media guide, accessed November 7, 2011 In his senior year, Loyola returned four starters and had eyes on repeating as champions. Rouse upped his averages to 15.6 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. However, he dislocated his shoulder early in the season, hampering his effectiveness. Rouse was still named an honorable mention All-American at the close of the season. Rouse scored 1,169 points and grabbed 982 rebounds in his Loyola career. His #40 jersey was retired in 1993. Following the close of his college career, Rouse was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals in the 1964 NBA draft (seventh round, 60th pick); however, he never played in the league. Instead, Rouse earned three master's degrees and a PhD. During his postgraduate academic study, he served as a student member of the Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees from 1971 to 1974., Southern Illinois University System. Retrieved April 5, 2018. He owned his own educational consulting firm and taught courses at the University of Maryland. On July 11, 2013, to observe the 50th anniversary of the national championship, President Barack Obama welcomed surviving Loyola players Hunter, Jerry Harkness, John Egan and Ron Miller to the Oval Office to honor the team. The entire squad was then inducted in November of that year by the College Basketball Hall of Fame. He died on May 31, 1999, in Annapolis, Maryland at age 56.

It refers to behavior that is judged according to generally accepted norms of behavior.Trevino, Linda K., Weaver, Gary R., and Reynolds, Scott J. \\"Behavioral Ethics in Organizations: A review\\". Journal of Management, 2006, p. 952. Behavioral ethics lead to the development of ethical models such as the so-called \\"bystander intervention\\", which describes ethical behavior as far harder to display because of what we learn from social institutions such as family, school, and religion. Here, intervening in an ethically challenging situation means that an individual must go through several steps and that failure to complete all means a failure to behave ethically.  Behavioral ethics in different fields  = Behavioral ethics and education = In ethics teaching and research, ethics is arguably the \\"next big thing\\" because its investigation agenda has generated many knowledge on why and how people choose and act when being confronted with ethical subject, which was unknown previously. Based on the extant body of ethics course books and course plans from fields such as medicine, teaching, accounting, and journalism, \\"moral reasoning\\" - along with associated skills - is often an established objective. Behavioral ethics, however, is distinguished from the concept of moral reasoning because ethical behavior is primarily driven by a diverse set of intuitive processes over which individuals have little conscious control. Behavioral ethics calls for a model of ethics in education that focuses not on directly modeling good ethical reasoning but on the way people think clearly and impartially about ethical problems. = Behavioral Ethics and Rational Actor Model = Philosophical views about morality has been supported traditionally by theoretical reasoning and introspection, with at best passing reference to actual human behavior. Models of human morality advanced by behavioral ethics based on the fact that morality is a new and still developing quality of the evolutionary dynamic that leads to our species. = Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics = Clarifying the difference between behavioral law and economics(BLE) and behavioral ethics(BE) is of importance. Compared to BLE, BE has reduced its ability of influencing broad legal academic circles. In addition, unlike BLE, BE was advanced as piece of the management literature, which is less related to legal scholarship than BLE is, and thus less likely to have impact on it. = Behavioral Ethics and Justice = Behavioral ethics researchers have found the relationship between employees' justice perceptions and also, ethical and unethical behavior. In the 1990s, organizational justice became one of the most studied organizational themes. The term organizational justice is created by Greenberg(1987) to involve employee's perception of organizational events, policies, and practices as being fair or not fair. Classic work on distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice has been built. This research has focused on theoretical advance and empirical testing about the formation of justice judgements as well as the result of these justice evaluation. Justice and injustice perception have been related to an extensive variety of employee attitudes and behaviors consisted of trust, satisfaction, turnover and plenty of opposite formal negative behaviors such as theft and unethical behaviors which are more common. Research There are experiments that can be linked to behavioral ethics. The Trolley problem and the Prisoner's dilemma both place individuals in decision-making situations that carry ethical questions. In each, an individual is asked to make a decision that affects another person. In the prisoner's dilemma, the principles of Reciprocity (social psychology) and Cooperation come into play, but not all who participate behave in the same manner. In the Trolley problem an individual has to choose which group of people to save. Both of these experiments shed light on how people behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.  The impact of behavioral ethics  If firms are able to utilize the principles of behavioral psychology to alter consumer's behavior and thus increase sales and governments can change people's behavior and hence promote policy target using those same principles, then individuals and their employers can apply related principles of behavioral ethics to promote ethical behavior in the company and in society.  Example of Unethical behavior in Business  According to an article in the Chron.com, examples of unethical behavior in business an environment can include: # Deliberate Deception # Violation of Conscience # Failure to Honor Commitments # Unlawful Conduct # Disregard of Company Policy These behaviors are mostly based on different rights that we all have in society and therefore have in work environments as well. Usually each company have its own set of policy but there are some common ones as well.  Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings  At most business conference, employees are required to report on the progress of their missions. It can lead to an ethical dilemma because they may report their performance better than it is due to external pressure.  Unethical behavior  Unethical behavior is an action that falls outside of what is thought morally appropriate for a person, a job or a company. Individuals can act unethically, as can businesses, professionals and politicians. = Unethical behavior in business = Ethics can be defined as going beyond what is legal and doing right things, even no one is paying attention to. So unethical behavior in business is about actions that don't obey the acceptable criterion of business operations, failing to do right things in each condition.

Early life and Family  Rowley was born on October 31, 1912 in Manchester, England. As the youngest of four, Rowley always had a playful, ambitious edge; which only helped his future highly demanding career. He met his wife Diana at the Royal Geographical Society in Cambridge, where she was a student editor, and after many failed accounts on asking her to go out on a date with him, she finally gave in and they were inseparable from that day forth. They married twice, once in 1944 (a civil wedding before he left for the army) and again in 1945 in a Church setting. Together they had three healthy daughters: Anne, Sue (Susan) and Jane. Rowley and Diana were married for 69 years, and shared their passions for the Arctic together.  Second World War  Throughout WWII  Education  He attended Clare College, Cambridge, and received his B.A. from the University of Cambridge in 1934 and his M.A. from the same institution in 1936. From 1936 to 1939, Rowley engaged in an archaeological excavation in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. During this time, he discovered new islands in Fox Basin, carried out the original exploration of the Baffin Island coast, crossed Baffin Island by a new route, and excavated the first major site in Dorset culture. Because of his work with the Inuit and Dorset peoples, Rowley had a large island and river in the Arctic named after him. A Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, Rowley was awarded the Society's prestigious Massey Medal in 1963 for his geographical work. As a scientist with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in the early 1970s, he created a training program for Northern scientists and developed ground and air support services for scientific groups working in the Arctic. He was made an honorary member of the American Polar Society in 1985, due to his countless advancements and discoveries in the field. He died in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on December 31, 2003, surrounded by his wife, daughters and grandchildren.

The Alaska moose is the largest North American subspecies of moose. Alaska moose inhabit boreal forests and mixed deciduous forests throughout most of Alaska and most of Western Yukon. Like all moose species, the Alaska moose is usually solitary but sometimes will form small herds. Typically, they only come into contact with other moose for mating or competition for mates. The males and females select different foraging habitats leading to spatial segregation throughout much of the year. During mating season, in autumn and winter, male Alaska moose become very aggressive and prone to attacking when startled. Diet Alaska moose have a similar diet to other moose subspecies, consisting of terrestrial vegetation forbs and shoots from trees such as willow and birch. Alaska moose require a daily intake of 9770 kilocalories (32 kg). Alaska moose lack upper front teeth but have eight sharp incisors on their lower jaw. They also have a tough tongue, gums and lips to help chew woody vegetation. Size and weight Alaska moose are sexually dimorphic with males being 40% heavier than females. Male Alaska moose can stand over at the shoulder, and weigh over . The antlers on average have a span of . Antler size and conformation are influenced by genetics, nutrition, and age. The antlers establish social rank and affect mating success. Female Alaska moose stand on average at the shoulder and can weigh close to . The largest Alaska moose was shot in western Yukon in September 1897; it weighed , and was tall at the shoulder.Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc (1983), While Alaska moose with the Chukotka moose, matches the extinct Irish elk, they are smaller than Cervalces latifrons, the largest deer of all time. Social structure and reproduction Alaska moose have no social bonds with each other and only come into contact with each other to mate, or for two bull moose to fight over mating rights. Although a bull moose is not usually aggressive towards humans, during mating season it may attack any creature it comes into contact with, including humans, wolves, other deer or even bears. Bull moose often get their antlers locked during a fight, and both moose typically die from starvation. Bull moose call out a subtle mating call to attract female moose and to warn other males. If a male moose loses to another male, he has to wait another year to mate. Alaska moose mate every year during autumn and winter, and usually produce one or two offspring at a time. At around 10‚Äì11 months, yearling Alaska moose leave their mothers and fend for themselves. Hunting Alaska moose are hunted for food and sport every year during fall and winter. People use both firearms and bows to hunt moose.

Plot J√±ƒÅne≈õvar was the second of the four children of Vitthal Govind Kulkarni and Rukmini, a pious couple from Apegaon near Paithan on the banks of the river Godavari. Vitthal had studied Vedas and set out on pilgrimages at a young age. In Alandi, about 30 km from Pune, Sidhopant, a local Yajurveda Brahmin was very much impressed with him and Vitthal married his daughter Rukmini. After some time, getting permission from Rukmini, Vitthal went to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, India, where he met Ramananda Swami and requested to be initiated into sannyas, lying about his marriage. But Ramananda Swami later went to Alandi and, convinced that his student Vitthal was the husband of Rukmini, he returned to Kashi and ordered Vitthal to return home to his family. The couple was excommunicated from the Brahmin caste as Vitthal had broken with sannyas, the last of the four ashrams. Four children were born to them; Nivrutti, J√±ƒÅndev, Sopan, Mukta. It is believed that later Vitthal and Rukmini ended their lives by jumping into the waters at Prayag where the river Ganges meets Yamuna, hoping that their children would be accepted into the society after their death. The orphaned children grew up on alms. They approached the Brahmin community of Paithan to accept them, but the Brahmins refused. According to the disputed \\"Shuddhi Patra\\", the children were purified by the Brahmins on the condition of observing celibacy. But when they returned, the Brahmins did not pay any attention to the Shuddhi Patra and said that it was fake. Later, a farmer took them to live with his family, where J√±ƒÅne≈õvar translated the Bhagavad Gita into the Marathi language and performed many miracles; riding on a flying wall was the most famous of these.

The company's Mission Statement reads \\"to stage old and new rarely staged European plays in original translations, new New Zealand plays, and classical English texts in an unusual and experimental style\\". The name Free Theatre was chosen in homage to European predecessors Freie B√ºhne in Germany and Th√©√¢tre Libre in France, groups who were striving for productions to be free from social, political and aesthetic conventions. In 1982, Free Theatre registered as an incorporated society That same year they built a 100-seat theatre in the Christchurch Arts Centre, Christchurch, as a space for their experimentation. It was originally known as the Free Theatre and later became called the University Theatre. The Free Theatre has served as a launching pad for a number of other groups (Pacific Underground for example) and supported a number of smaller groups to present new work. In 2008, to celebrate the company's contribution to Christchurch, bringing together past and present members, the arts editor of the Christchurch Press wrote: \\"For quarter of a century Free Theatre has refined cultural horizons and shaped Christchurch's perceptions of contemporary theatre\\" In February 2011, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake destroyed several theatre work spaces used by Free Theatre. Due to damage from the earthquake, both the University Theatre and Nibelheim have been deemed inaccessible, while Old Queens Theatre has been demolished. However the company has continued to produce a number of productions - The Earthquake in Chile, Hereafter and Canterbury Taleshttp://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and- stage/9334640/Puppets-parade-through-city-streetshttp://www.stuff.co.nz/the- press/opinion/perspective/9410811/Creative-thinkers-engage-with-real-world- problems- Free Theatre members have also been involved in post-earthquake initiatives such as Gap Filler, Greening the Rubble and Arts Voice. In May 2014, Free Theatre in collaboration with Arts Circus signed a two-year lease for The Gym, taking up the first arts-practice tenancy in the new Arts Centre.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/the-rebuild/10109184/Theatre- company-moving-into-CBD After filming the company over several years New Zealand filmmaker Shirley Horrocks released a documentary Free Theatre: 37 Yearshttp://www.pointofview.co.nz/FreeTheatre.htm in the 2017 New Zealand International Film Festival.  Productions  In the 1980s, Free Theatre became known for a series of productions that included: Woyzeck, King Ubu, Round Dance, King Lear, The Joffongract, 1984, A Ride Across Lake Constance, Cowboy Mouth, The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny and Lulu.\\"Archive\\" on the Free Theatre website The Free Theatre Group also staged a number of cabarets in the 1980s, presented in what was known as Nibelheim, the basement space below Te Puna Toi and the SoFA Gallery in the Christchurch Arts Centre. This led to complaints from Arts Centre residents, who went to court with the aim to expel Free Theatre as tenants. The case was eventually thrown out of court. In the 1990s, Free Theatre performed: Hamlet Machine, Salome, Medea Material, Crusoe, Murderer Hope of Woman/The Philosopher's Stone and Bakkhai/Diotek. Over the last decade Free Theatre has performed Last Days of Mankind, Footprints/Tapuwae, Samson Airline, Fantasia, Philoctetes, Diana Down Under, Ella and Susn, Faust Chroma, Distraction Camp, Doctor Faustus, The Earthquake in Chile, Hereafter, I Sing the Body Electric.\\"A Rare Visitation of Exceptional Theatre\\" on the Theatre Review website In 2009 Free Theatre released a feature-length film Remake. Free Theatre often performs in non- traditional theatre spaces. The 2011 production The Earthquake in Chile was performed inside and around an Anglican church. In 2012 Hereafter premiered in The Tannery, Woolston. In October 2013 as part of FESTA, Free Theatre took to the streets of Christchurch at night with the carnivalesque Canterbury Tales, a collaboration with local artists, hospitality and architectural schools from Christchurch, Auckland and Sydney.  Training and education Over the years a wide range of emerging and established artists, including poets, filmmakers, sculptors, writers, musicians, dancers and actors, have collaborated within the Free Theatre to perform in various spaces around the North and South Island of New Zealand. From the start, the emphasis of Free Theatre's work has been on non-verbal action and high production standards, discouraging the star system and encouraging long rehearsal and training periods in a company context. In most cases, Free Theatre productions are 'physical theatre' in the sense that the starting point for each actor is not psychology (as in naturalism) but the body and voice. Training is therefore ongoing, even when no project is currently in rehearsal. The exercises used in training have evolved from a diverse range of sources, including the theory and practice of Vsevolod Meyerhold, Bertolt Brecht, Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook, Richard Schechner, Augusto Boal, Eugenio Barba and Tadashi Suzuki. The success of the Free Theatre in the 1980s led to the development of a dedicated drama programme at the University of Canterbury in 1988. In 1997, it gained department status becoming Theatre and Film Studies and was the first in the country to run a postgraduate programme in theatre and film. Recent publications by Free Theatre members on Free Theatre work include Ryan Reynolds Moving Targets, Emma Johnston's Healing Maori Through Song and Dance and Marian McCurdy's Acting and its Refusal in Theatre and Film Free Theatre runs classes in Pataphysical Theatre, a physical theatre training and devising programme.http://www.freetheatre.org.nz/education.html Awards and honors Free Theatre have received the following awards and nominations:\\"Awards and Nominations\\" on the Free Theatre website * 2012 Best Theatre (I Sing the Body Electric), The Press 'Best Of the Year: Theatre' * 2012 'Get to Adelaide Fringe' Award (Hereafter), Dunedin Fringe Festival * 2009 Nominee for The Montana Award, Most Original Production (Faust Chroma), Chapman Tripp NZ Theatre Awards * 2009 Award for Best Theatre (Ella and Susn), Dunedin Fringe Festival * 2009 Nominee for Best Production Design (Ella and Susn), Dunedin Fringe Festival * 2009 Award for Best Production Design (Faust Chroma), Wellington Fringe Festival * 2008 Award for Best Theatre (Faust Chroma), Dunedin Fringe Festival * 2008 Nominee for Best Production Design (Faust Chroma), Dunedin Fringe Festival References Notes External links *Official website *The Arts on Sunday feature, Radio New Zealand National, 18 May 2008 (audio).

These are sodium salts of the orange- colored decavanadate anion [V10O28]6‚àí. Numerous other decavanadate salts have been isolated and studied since 1956 when it was first characterized. Preparation The preparation of decavanadate is achieved by acidifying an aqueous solution of ortho-vanadate: :10 Na3[VO4] + 24 HOAc ‚Üí Na6[V10O28] + 12 H2O + 24 NaOAc The formation of decavanadate is optimized by maintaining a pH range of 4‚Äì7. Typical side products include metavanadate, [VO3]‚àí, and hexavanadate, [V6O16]2‚àí, ions. Structure The decavanadate ion consists of 10 fused VO6 octahedra and has D2h symmetry. The structure of Na6[V10O28]¬∑18H2O has been confirmed with X-ray crystallography. Figure 1: structure of decavanadate ion with equivalent V and O atoms indicated The decavanadate anions contains three sets of equivalent V atoms (see fig. 1). These include two central VO6 octahedra (Vc) and four each peripheral tetragonal-pyramidal VO5 groups (Va and Vb). There are seven unique groups of oxygen atoms (labeled A through G). Two of these (A) bridge to six V centers, four (B) bridge three V centers, fourteen of these (C, D and E) span edges between pairs of V centers, and eight (F and G) are peripheral. The oxidation state of vanadium in decavanadate is +5. Acid-base properties Aqueous vanadate (V) compounds undergo various self-condensation reactions. Depending on pH, major vanadate anions in solution include VO2(H2O)42+, VO43‚àí, V2O73‚àí, V3O93‚àí, V4O124‚àí, and V10O266‚àí. The anions often reversibly protonate. Decavanadate forms according to this equilibrium: :H3V10O283‚àí ‚áå H2V10O284‚àí \\\\+ H+ :H2V10O284‚àí ‚áå HV10O285‚àí \\\\+ H+ :HV10O285‚àí(aq) ‚áå V10O286‚àí \\\\+ H+ The structure of the various protonation states of the decavanadate ion has been examined by 51V NMR spectroscopy. Each species gives three signals; with slightly varying chemical shifts around ‚àí425, ‚àí506, and ‚àí523 ppm relative to vanadium oxytrichloride; suggesting that rapid proton exchange occurs resulting in equally symmetric species. The three protonations of decavanadate have been shown to occur at the bridging oxygen centers, indicated as B and C in figure 1. Decavanadate is most stable in pH 4‚Äì7 region.

He is the current owner of Pococks Indoor Beach Volleyball. Early and personal life Pocock grew up in Zimbabwe and emigrated to South Africa in 1982. He started off his volleyball career following in his brother‚Äôs footsteps when he was schooling at the Port Rex Technical High School in East London, South Africa, first playing as setter and then moving to middle blocker. In 1990, he played for the Border Province Junior and Senior teams. Brothers Michael Pocock and Andrew Pocock Indoor volleyball career Pocock started his volleyball career in 1990 by helping his older brother, Andrew Carbis Innes Pocock train. Pocock quickly found success in the sport due to his natural high jumping ability and his 6 foot-5 inch-tall frame. Pocock made the Border province school team and the Border Senior Men's team in 1990. In 1991, Pocock moved to Bloemfontein to serve his military duties. Pocock was selected to represent the South African National Defence Force team. Pocock was also selected into the South African National volleyball team in 1991. Following this, Pocock achieved the following achievements: * 1990‚Äì2003 Men‚Äôs Provincial Teams * SA National Team ‚Äì Blocker * Winner - Zone 6 All African Games Qualifier Botswana *1995 Winner - Zone 6 All African Games Qualifier Zimbabwe * Awarded best blocker in Zone 6 *1999 4th at the All African Games, South Africa *2000 Winner of the Belgium / SA Series, South Africa Beach volleyball career Pocock started his beach volleyball career during the holidays after he had just finished his schooling in December 1990. Following his brother on the beach volleyball circuit, he played his first 8 tournaments getting knocked out in the qualifying stages in each one. After his military service and 2 years working in Bophuthatswana, Pocock returned to beach volleyball. By the end of 1995, Pocock had joined team player, Dave Hodge and was ranked Number 1 in South Africa. In 1996, Pocock sealed his claim as South Africa‚Äôs number 1 player by winning the Tri Nations King of the Beach tournament in Durban. In March 2004, Pocock teamed up with Gershon Rorich and entered the FIVB SWATCH World beach volleyball tour. By August 2004, Pocock and partner had made history by becoming the first beach volleyball team from the African continent to ever qualify for an Olympic Games. Pocock played the opening beach volleyball match of the 2004 Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, against the host nation‚Äôs team of Pavlos Beligratis and Thanassis Michalopoulos. The South African‚Äôs, ranked 19th, played 3 matches in the round robin phase winning 2 and losing 1. Won vs Pavlos Beligratis / Thanassis Michalopoulos (6) from Greece 21‚Äì16, 24‚Äì26, 15‚Äì10 (1:18) Lost vs Mariano Baracetti / Martin Conde (7) from Argentina 13‚Äì21, 15‚Äì21 (0:36) Won vs Joao Brenha / Miguel Maia (18) from Portugal 22‚Äì20, 22‚Äì20 (0:49) By winning 2 matches, Pocock and partner progressed to the final 16 teams, knockout stage where they were knocked out, placing 9th for the tournament, the highest result ever achieved by any beach volleyball team from Africa. Lost vs Julien Prosser / Mark Williams (17) from Australia 14v21, 10‚Äì21 (0:35) Pocock currently resides in Johannesburg, South Africa and owns the largest indoor beach volleyball venue in Southern Africa.

As external respiration depends on the exchange of gases due to partial pressures across a semipermeable membrane and normally occurs at SATP, an oxygen equivalent may aid in recognizing and managing variable oxygen availability during procedures such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy or medical air transport. It does so by expressing oxygen concentration as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen at a given altitude or pressure to Standard Atmospheric Pressure; rather than as a ratio of the PO2 at a given pressure to the total pressure of the gas mixture. The latter would generally be 0.2095, the atmospheric concentration by volume of O2, although FO2 and Patm vary for extraterrestrials. Calculations occur as follows: Let O2E be oxygen equivalent, FO2 be the fractional concentration of oxygen, Patm (generally 760 mmHg, barring intergalactic travel), Pb be the barometric pressure, and dP be the change in pressure at a given altitude. Then, O2E = FO2(Pb \\\\+ dP)/ Patm It is worthwhile to note that pressures may often be expressed in units of distance such as feet when diving. For this, note that descending 33 ft in salt water or 33.9 ft in fresh water results in a change of 1 atm, so distance and pressure are used interchangeably in this context.

Early life Epstein was Jewish, and born to Maximilian and Helena Epstein. He grew up in Roudnice nad Labem on the bank of the Elbe River, 22 miles north of Prague, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian province of Bohemia. He lived in a house built by his father in 1900, on the site on which his grandfather built the first ever house owned by a Jew outside the Jewish quarter of Prague in 1830. While in high school, he became a competitive rower and swimmer, and also a swimming coach. In 1924, he joined the Czechoslovak Army, was picked for reserve officers school, and became a second lieutenant. The Czechoslovak National Swim Club asked that he be granted leave of absence to compete for them. Water polo career Epstein represented Czechoslovakia in water polo at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. His team finished tied in ninth position in both Olympics. Incarceration in Nazi concentration camps After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Epstein was incarcerated at various Nazi concentration camps, including Theresienstadt concentration camp, Auschwitz concentration camp, and a labour camp at Frydlant. All of the other members of his family were killed as a result of being gassed by the Nazis. Later life He returned to Prague after World War II, and was elected a member of the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee. After the Communists took over in 1948, he emigrated to the United States. He married Franci Rabinek Solar, a dress designer who had herself been interned at Theresienstadt concentration camp, then Auschwitz concentration camp, and finally Bergen-Belsen concentration camp from which the British had liberated her. She was also the only survivor in her family. They had a daughter, Helen Epstein, who became a writer and an associate professor of journalism at New York University, and two sons. In New York City during 1948, the New York Athletic Club permitted Kurt to observe one of their water polo matches, but clarified that as they did not accept Jews as members, he would not be hired as a coach. After a decade of being unable to find steady employment, he ultimately became a cutter in a clothing factory of Star Children's Wear in the Garment District.

It is located in the borough of Sainte-Foy‚ÄìSillery‚ÄìCap-Rouge. There are nearly 8,000 students registered at the college, making it one of the largest in the province outside of Montreal. It was founded in 1967. History In 1967, cegeps were established in the province of Quebec, following the criticism brought by the Rapport Parent. Indeed, before the law 60 was adopted, the costs to access to higher education were too expensive, the level of education was too poor and the admission to superior school was too strenuous. This legislation led to the construction of twelve cegeps in Quebec, including the C√©gep de Sainte-Foy. The C√©gep de Sainte-Foy was founded on July 1, 1967. However, the education system began long before that. Actually, in 1862, the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools created The Quebec Commercial Academy, located on Auteuil's street, which welcomed one hundred and fifty anglophone students. At that time, only boys were allowed to study at that college. In 1865, this institution moved to the intersection of Sainte-Ang√®le and Elgin's streets. Having proven themselves as a credible educational facility, they moved once again in 1893 to Cook's street and were in the obligation to expand the establishment to Chauveau's Avenue, due to the excessive number of students attending the school. In reason of its growing clientele, The Quebec Commercial Academy sold its installations, which were located at the center of Vieux-Qu√©bec, to the provincial government. In 1961, the construction of the new school began on Chemin Sainte-Foy. However, it is only in 1962 that the establishment is ready to welcome students. Since 1965, the school opens its doors to girls. It is officially named C√©gep de Sainte- Foy in 1967. Programs =Pre-University= There are seventeen pre- university program at the C√©gep de Sainte-Foy. These programs are distributed in three big categories which are letters and arts, natural sciences and human sciences. In letters and arts, the students can choose between eight programs which are visual arts, culture and arts, literature and arts, creation and cinema and music. There are also double DEC linked with music which are music and natural sciences, music and human sciences with or without mathematic. In natural sciences, there are two profiles to choose from and a double DEC: the regular profile, the environment, life and health profile and science, letters and arts. In human sciences, there are five profiles to choose from and a regular DEC. The different profile are discovery of human sciences (with or without math), organisation and management with mathematics, help relationship and social intervention (with or without math), education and culture (with or without math), international issues and challenges (with or without math) and the DEC is civilisation and history.http://www.cegep-ste- foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et-techniques/ * Science, letters and arts:http://www.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et- techniques/sciences-lettres-et-arts/description/''' Science, letters and arts, also known as integrated DEC (D.I.), is a two years integrated triple DEC combining natural science, human science and letters and art. In this program, students will see the human under every possible angle. As there are only few student accepted every year (65 in 2012), groups are smaller than the average and stay the same in each class for every semesters. In addition, teachers of this program are chosen among the bests and must be implicated in their students' scholar life. Therefore, they offer special activities such as trip to USA or special conferences related to culture or to the material presented in class. To be accepted, there is no quota, high school students must only have over 80% of academic average. It makes the D.I. the only elite program offered in Cegeps. The most important part of this DEC is the eligibility for EVERY university programs, except for graphical arts and music. Many people could think it comes with an overwhelming work charge, but it is comparable to natural science. If you are interested in this program and would like to know if you have the typical profile, there is a test, in French, on the CEGEP web site. * Music: The music department of the CEGEP Ste-Foy is founded in 1982. There is only fourteen CEGEP in the entire Qu√©bec that offers the music program and the CEGEP Ste-Foy is the only public one in Quebec city, because the Campus Notre-Dame-De-Foy is a private college.Portail du r√©seau coll√©gial  Musique Each year, the music program count approximately 250 students in 3 different programs, music, music/science and music/social science. Students learn how to master correctly their instruments, but also learn more on the music history and its evolution through years, they learn how to analyze pieces of music, to do solfege and musical dications so they can develop their ear. There is a wide choice of instruments the students can learn: Trumpet, trombone, percussions, piano, guitar and many many more... Students can participate to many musical activities, contests, concerts and they can take part to five different big ensembles, wind orchestra, chamber orchestra, choral singing, stage band and vocal jazz. * Film Studieshttp://www.cegep-ste- foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et-techniques/cinema-et- creation/description/''' Film Studies is a 2-year pre-university program. It brings the student to know more about American and Quebec cinema industries, which are more related to the cegep's culture, as well as foreign films while teaching how to make a movie through writing scenarios, creating storyboards, creating movie posters, filming, acting and post-production. It also brings the student to learn about other related arts such as theatre and literature. At the end of the program, a student will have made an animated movie, a movie poster, publicity and a short fiction movie. Besides offering the basic courses such as French, philosophy, physical education and English, the program offers classes such as Filmmakers and influences, Art history, Photography, Film production and more. * Natural Sciences: The Natural Sciences program is a 2 years program. Its goal is to prepare the students to University. It leads to a specific collegial studies diploma. The main goals of the Natural Sciences program are to make sure that the students are able to apply the scientific process, learn in an autonomous way and resolve problems in a way that is systematic. It also aims the development of abilities like to reason rigorously, communicate precisely, establish links between science, technology and society's evolution and finally to adopt useful attitudes towards scientific work.http://www.mels.gouv.qc.ca/sections/publications/publications/Ens_Sup/Affaires_universitaires_collegiales/Ens_collegial/200.B0_Sciences_de_la_nature.pdf Furthermore, the specific goals of this program are to analyze literary texts, to assess the contribution of social sciences to contemporary issues and to study the living organization, its different mechanisms and its diversity. There are 4 semesters for the 3 different programs (namely the regular profile, ELH (Environment, Life and Health) and Sciences, Letters and Arts).http://www.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/csf4/index.php?id=4 The Natural Sciences program is one of the main pre-university programs at CEGEP de Sainte-Foy. It is divided in three branches: the regular profile, the Environment, Life and Health science program (ELH) and the Letter and Arts science program.http://www.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/ The Environment Life and Health program focuses on multidisciplinary work and gives a higher importance to environment than the regular profile.http://www.cegep-ste- foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et-techniques/sciences-de-la- nature-profil-environnement-vie-et-sante/description/ The Letter and Arts science program has more social science and art classes than the regular profile although they have less science classes.http://www.cegep-ste- foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et-techniques/sciences-lettres-et- arts/description/ These three different programs lead to the same diploma and are considered equal when it comes to university admissions. However, the people in the Letter and Arts program will see their grades slightly improved since their program is considered harder than the two others. The regular program has the most flexible curriculum and the most students. They can choose five of their 28 classes.* Of those five classes, two are not necessarily science related.http://www.cegep-ste- foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et-techniques/sciences-de-la- nature-profil-regulier/grille-de-cours/ ELH is, as its name says, more environment and health-related. In the first semester, the mechanics class is replaced by a biology class and the two biology classes are mandatory.http://www.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et- techniques/sciences-de-la-nature-profil-environnement-vie-et-sante/grille-de- cours/ ELH students also have an Environment class in their third semester,http://www.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et- techniques/sciences-de-la-nature-profil-environnement-vie-et-sante/grille-de- cours/ instead of being able to choose between nine different science classes. Unlike the regular profile, ELH classes are in closed groups, which means that, except for English classes, complementary courses and physical education, ELH groups are not mixed with students of other programs.http://www.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/csf4/programmes/preuniversitaires-et- techniques/sciences-de-la-nature-profil-environnement-vie-et- sante/description/ =Extracurricular Programs= LINK LINK is a program offered to the students of the C√©gep de Sainte-Foy.

District 19 includes downtown Boise, the North End, East End, Foothills, Warm Springs Mesa, Foothills and Highlands areas of Boise. In 2010, Cronin was chosen by fellow House Democrats as Minority Caucus Chairman. Early life and career Cronin was born in New York City and attended elementary and junior high school in Ridgewood, New Jersey. In 1986, he moved to Idaho, where he graduated from high school. He earned a bachelor's degree in History at Haverford College in 1992. In 1995, he earned an Ed.M in Teaching and Curriculum from Harvard University. In between college and graduate school, Cronin worked in Ecuador as a WorldTeach volunteer, teaching English at the Universidad T√©cnica de Manab√≠ in Portoviejo. After returning to the United States, Cronin taught history at Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York. He then served as communications director for Junior Chamber International in Miami before returning to Idaho in 1998. Cronin worked in a variety of marketing/communication roles for Hewlett-Packard and Wirestone before starting his own consulting firm in 2003. Personal In 1996, Cronin married Ver√≥nica Franco Lopez. Ver√≥nica founded and directs the Garabatos Spanish Preschool in Boise. The couple has twin daughters, Kyra and Alana, born in 2002. Political career In 2002, Cronin worked as press secretary for gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brady, who was defeated by Dirk Kempthorne. The following year, Cronin served as press secretary for State Representative Dave Bieter in his successful bid for Mayor of Boise. Cronin ran for office in 2004, for the Idaho House seat in District 19 that was vacated by longtime Representative Ken Robison. Cronin placed second in a three-way Democratic primary, losing to Nicole LeFavour. In 2008, when Senator Mike Burkett retired and LeFavour ran for his Senate seat, Cronin ran again for state representative in District 19, defeating Republican Kevin McGowan.

In the 2011 legislative session, Cronin became known as the leading voice opposing Superintendent Tom Luna's \\"Students Come First\\" reform plan. Despite his fierce opposition, Cronin earned praise from Luna and House Education Committee Chairman Bob Nonini in an Idaho Statesman profile of Cronin. Cronin's impassioned debate against the various pieces of legislation that Luna proposed was widely quoted throughout Idaho and around the country. In the fall of 2011, Cronin was selected as a Rodel Fellow at the Aspen Institute. Each year, the Aspen Institute selects 24 ‚Äúrising stars‚Äù in state or local government from around the nation for a two-year fellowship, designed to foster thoughtful leadership, bi-partisan collaboration, and new approaches to problem solving.

It is native to North America, where it occurs in eastern Canada and the central and eastern United States. Its common names include American plantain, blackseed plantain, pale plantain, and Rugel's plantain. The species name rugelii honors Ferdinand Ignatius Xavier Rugel (1806-1879), a German-born botanist and pharmacist. This perennial herb grows from a taproot and fibrous root system. It produces a basal rosette of wide oval leaves with longitudinal veining and a somewhat waxy texture. The base of the petiole may be reddish or purple. A scape bears clusters of whitish flowers. The fruit is a capsule about half a centimeter long containing several seeds. It splits down the middle. Plantago major is very similar, but it lacks the red tinge on the petioles and its leaves are darker and waxier.

Schraubstadter had been superintendent of the old foundry and, not being offered a similar position in the consolidation, founded Inland with his two brothers, Oswald and Carl Jr. At first the foundry sold type made by the Keystone Type Foundry and the Great Western Type Foundry, but soon enough was cutting and casting faces of their own. All three brothers were familiar with the foundry business and quite soon the firm began making type that was \\"state of the art,\\" being point-set and having a common base-line for all faces of the same body size. This last feature was a recent innovation and, as Inland had no back stock of non-linging faces, they advertised this heavily as \\"Standard Line Type.\\" Two magazines, Practical Printer and Printers' Wit & Humor were published by the firm in order to showcase their type. In 1897 Inland bought out the Western Engravers' Supply Company of St. Louis. In 1911 the brothers sold the foundry to ATF, which divided the matrices between their own facility in Jersey City and that of their subsidiary Barnhart Brothers & Spindler in Chicago. While the other two brothers simply retired, Oswald Schraubstadter worked for ATF for many years.Eckman, James, The Inland Type Foundry, 1894-1911, PAGA, vol. 8, pp. 31-52, 1960. Inland was arguably the most successful American type foundry, certainly the most successful of its day. Several factors were responsible for this including the experience and capability of the Schraubstadter brothers, a well designed high-quality product, an aggressive program of direct mail advertising, and reduced transport costs due to both the closeness of lead mines and the concentration of the printing industry in the Midwest and Tennessee. Another factor in their success might have been widespread resentment among printers of the \\"type trust,\\" represented by ATF. Typefaces Inland, alone among foundries, often named their type faces after prominent customers. Studley, for instance, was named after Robert P. Studley, a St. Louis lithographer.

Biography Armando Pizzinato was the elder son of Battista Pizzinato and Andremonda Astolfo. He started work at 15 to help his mother after the loss of his father. He made an apprenticeship with a house painter and later was employed in a local bank. Since childhood he had a passion for painting and drawing, and the purchase of the book Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects by Giorgio Vasari (The Lives) played a large role in developing that passion even more. He was still a teenager when the manager of the bank arranged lessons for Armando with the painter Pio Rossi. Then, in 1930, thanks to the money he was earning, he could be enrolled in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia (School of fine arts of Venice). Shortly later he got to know some of his contemporaries such as Alberto Viani, Giulio Turcato, Mario De Luigi, Ferruccio Bortoluzzi (in the 40s), Carlo Scarpa, Afro Basaldella and Mirko Basaldella. In 1933 he takes part with five paintings to the exhibition Cinque giovani pittori veneti (Five young painters from Veneto) in the Gallery Il Milione in Milan. In 1936 he obtains a Marangoni scholarship to go to Rome. In 1940 he is the winner of the second Premio Bergamo (Bergamo award) (National painting exhibition). In 1941 he marries Zaira Candiani, with whom he had a daughter, Patrizia, born 19 August 1943. Zaira will be a source of inspiration for many of Pizzinato's paintings. After Zaira's death in 1962 Pizzinato married his second wife, Clarice Allegrini. During WWII Pizzinato was a socialist member of the Italian resistance movement, he was arrested by the fascists and imprisoned. After the war Pizzinato dedicates his life to art. He joins Italian avant-garde movements and participates, with Emilio Vedova and others, to the creation of the Fronte Nuovo delle Arti. The Fronte movement made an exhibition at the Venice Biennale in 1948. Peggy Guggenheim, who visited that exhibition, bought there the painting Primo maggio (in English: May Day) of Pizzinato and later donated it to the MoMA, where it still is. In turn, Pizzinato donated to Peggy Guggenheim a couple of paintings, such as Cantieri, still part of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. In those years he created, among other works, a mural with Emilio Vedova inspired by the Italian resistance. In 1949 works of Pizzinato were included by Alfred Barr and James Thrall Soby in the exhibition 20th Century Italian Art at the MoMA. In 1950 the Catherine Viviano Gallery in New York included works by Pizzinato in the exhibition Five Italian Painters. The same year, Pizzinato was invited at the 1950 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting (Carnegie International in Pittsburgh). The painting Un fantasma percorre l'Europa, which is considered as one of Pizzinato's masterpieces, is dated 1950 (exhibited in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna Ca' Pesaro, Venice). From 1950 on he deliberately brought the themes of his paintings in line with his political beliefs (e.g. works entitled Terra non Guerra, I difensori delle fabbricche, Saldatori). In 1952 he takes part to the exhibition Some contemporary Italian painters at the Crane Gallery in Manchester. The same year he participates to the Congress of People for Peace in Vienna. In 1968 he makes a large exhibition in Germany, first at the Neue Berliner Galerie and then at the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. A work of Pizzinato is also part of the Verzocchi collection of the Pinacoteca civica di Forl√¨.

They were first recognised as volcanic craters in 2011. A cluster of three small maar craters like these is unique in the Auckland volcanic field. Their ages are unknown but most probably all three erupted during the same eruptive episode. They could have been associated with the eruption of nearby McLaughlins Mountain but this is speculation at present. The cluster is composed of three maars, encircled by tuff cones that over tens of thousands of years have been partly breached and eroded by runoff from the small freshwater lakes appearing in the craters shortly after the eruption. Due to the maars' very gentle rise over the otherwise level terrace of Pleistocene age, their volcanic origin had not been recognised earlier. Puhinui Pond Crater, located near the reserve entrance, contains a farm pond. The crater is across and the nearly complete surrounding tuff cone rim rises above the pond. Puhinui Arena Crater is breached on both the west and east sides. It is across and its drained and sediment-filled flat floor is below the rim of the surrounding tuff ring. Puhinui Eroded Crater lies directly east of Arena Crater on the route of the small stream that drains the latter. Eroded Crater is breached at both west and east ends and its tuff cone partly eroded by the adjacent Puhinui Stream. It is less well-preserved than the other two craters but of similar size.

Hoegeng was famously known as the bravest and most honest police officer in Indonesia by the media and the people. Hoegeng lived in an era when many government officials were corrupt. Abdurrahman Wahid, former president of Indonesia once praised Hoegeng's honesty, saying that \\"there are only 3 honest police in the country: speed bumps (polisi tidur, literally meaning sleeping police but refers to speed bumps), police statues, and Hoegeng\\". Hoegeng is one of the briefest people to head the Indonesian national police agency from 1968-1971. Biography =Early life and education= Hoegeng was born in Pekalongan on 14 October 1921. His birth name was Iman Santoso. The name Hoegeng was taken from \\"bugel\\" (to \\"bugeng\\" and then \\"hugeng\\"; which means fat) due to his fat body as a child. His father was Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo from Tegal, a prosecutor in Pekalongan; his mother was Oemi Kalsoem. He had two younger sisters: Titi Soedjati and Soedjatmi. Hoegeng wanted to be a policeman because he was influenced by his father's friend who was a chief of police in his hometown Ating Natadikusumah. Another law-related officer who was his father's friend was Soeprapto. Hoegeng enrolled at Hollandsch Inlandsch School (HIS; elementary school) Pekalongan and graduated in 1934. He then enrolled at Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO; middle school) in the same town and graduated three years later. He moved to Yogyakarta to continue his study at Algemene Middlebare School (AMS; high school) majoring in Western languages and literature. While at AMS, Hoegeng befriended his senior Burhanuddin Harahap, his classmate Soedarpo Sastrosatomo, and his juniors Usmar Ismail and Rosihan Anwar. In 1940, after graduating, he moved to Batavia continuing his study at Recht Hoge School (RHS; law college), although some of his family members wanted him to enrolled at Middlebare Opleidingschool Voor Inlandsche Ambtenaren (MOSVIA; civil service college). There he involved in student organization named Unitas Studiosorum Indonesiensis (USI). In the organization, he met Soebadio Sastrosatomo, Subandrio, Oemar Senoadji, Chairul Saleh, and Hamid Algadrie. In March 1942, Japanese occupied Dutch East Indies. Initially, Hoegeng felt relieved with the Japanese's arrival. But, then Japanese military closed the RHS. Hoegeng then returned home in April; he used his free time to sell eggs and Japanese school books traveling from one city to another including Pati and Semarang with his friend Soehardjo Soerjobroto. In Semarang, he met his relative and was offered to work at Hoso Kyoku radio station. He was accepted and began to work one month later. While working at the station, he enrolled to a police course opening in Pekalongan. Hoegeng then applied and was accepted as one of eleven members of police force out of 130 applicants. He joined the Marshall General School in Military Police School, Fort Gordon, Georgia, United States. In April 1942, he returned home because the RHS was closed by the Japanese. He sold eggs and Japanese language books with his friend to Pati and Semarang. =Early career= Hoegeng originally felt disappointed because he found out that the output of the course was not for high-ranking officers (second inspector), but two ranks lower. However, he still went through it. While in the training, Hoegeng received 32 IDR per month, 19.50 IDR net. Everyday after training, the cadets were assigned as regular police officers in the city. His colleagues, the trainers and fellow cadets, later became prominent high-ranking officers including Soemarto, Soehardjo Soerjobroto, Soerojo, and Soedjono Partokoesoemo. After graduating from the course, Hoegeng was hesitant whether to continue his career as policeman or slightly turn as a judge. During that time, Soemarto, his trainer, registered Hoegeng to police officer course in Sukabumi. Hoegeng then was accepted, even though he was not too serious at the selection, among six others from Pekalongan, alumnus of the earlier course. In Sukabumi, Hoegeng listed to Koto Kaisatsu Gakko course, a course for anyone who already trained in the police. Before graduation, Hoegeng and his friends thought that they would be promoted to higher rank named Junsabucho. On the contrary, their rank were to be lowered to Minarai Junsabucho. They protested heavily of the decision until General Harada of Sixteenth Army visited the place to calm them down. In 1944, Hoegeng graduated and with his three friends, Soetrisno, Noto Darsono, and Soenarto, were assigned to Chiang Bu (security department) of Semarang. Hoegeng and Soenarto held the Koto Kei Satsuka (intelligence division) post, while Noto and Soetrisno respectively were given position at Keimu Ka (general affairs) and Keiza Ka (economic affairs). After several weeks in Semarang, Hoegeng was promoted to Kei Bu Ho II. In the next several months, Hoegeng once again were promoted, this time to Kei Bu Ho I. Shortly before Japanese surrendered to Allied forces, Hoegeng were reassigned to Keibi Ka Cho (custody division) under the leadership of R. Soekarno Djojonegoro and was promoted again. One day after the proclamation, Soeprapto, friend of Hoegeng's father, gathered the police members, including Hoegeng and his superior Soekarno Djojonegoro, and told them about the independence of Indonesia and that there was to be a transfer of power. In October, Hoegeng was admitted to a hospital (now Karyadi Hospital) in Semarang after suffering concussion during his duty guarding Japanese prisoners. At that time, the Five Days Battle between Indonesian fighters and Japanese prisoners occurred. In the morning before the hospital was stormed by the Japanese, Hoegeng fled because he didn't like the hospital atmosphere and fled from the place he was treated. After the battle began to cease, Hoegeng was recommended by doctor to rest. He then took leave and rested in Pekalongan. While in Pekalongan, Hoegeng was visited by Commodore M. Nazir who was later to be the first Navy's chief of staff. Nazir interested in Hoegeng because he wanted to establish navy's military police and offered the latter to be a part of the navy. Hoegeng then accepted the offer mainly because he wanted a challenge as the police force was already well-established. As a military officer ranked Major, he was given the right to live at Hotel Merdeka, Yogyakarta, and paid 400 IDR per month. Under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Darwis, Commander of Navy Base in Tegal, his first duty was to formulate the basic foundation of the military police which was, at the beginning, named Penyelidik Militer Laut Khusus (PMLC; special navy investigator) unit. During living in the hotel, Hoegeng was persuaded by Soekanto Tjokrodiatmodjo, the chief police, to rejoin the police. In Yogyakarta, Hoegeng had another activity as a main character of a radio play Saija dan Adinda broadcast by Angkatan Laoet, Darat, dan Oedara radio (ALDO; navy, land, and air forces) and RRI Yogya. He later married his counterpart in the play, Merry, on 31 October 1946 in Jetis, Yogyakarta. After they married, Hoegeng resigned as the navy officer to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a police officer. =Indonesian independence and occupation by the Dutch= After rejoining, Hoegeng was listed as a student of Akademi Kepolisian (Police Academy) in Mertoyudan, Magelang. During his vacation in the middle of 1947, Hoegeng and his wife, who was pregnant, visited his family in Pekalongan. However, on 21 July the Dutch military conducted a military operation. Hoegeng and his family then fled to south of the town. Hoegeng was told by Soekarno Djojonegoro, chief police of Pekalongan, that Soekanto had ordered all of the students of the academy to help the local police department. Hoegeng's duty at that time was collecting intelligence material. Later, he was arrested by police officers who worked for NICA. While arrested, Hoegeng was treated well, unlike the others. He eventually found out that the one who gave the order was de Bretonniere, his friend in RHS. Hoegeng was persuaded to work for NICA but refused. After three weeks, he was released. Hoegeng then decided to visit the commando Yogyakarta. He, his wife, and his parents went to Jakarta at first. In Jakarta, Hoegeng met Soemarto who was a deputy chief police at that time and was asked to be the latter's subordinate. Hoegeng accepted but wanted to visit Yogyakarta. He was helped by Soemarto and left his wife and went alone in September. In Yogyakarta, Hoegeng reported his duty to Soekanto and requested for permission as Soemarto's subordinate in Jakarta; Soekanto gave the permission. In November, Hoegeng worked as Soemarto's assistant and was given duty to observe Indonesian political prisoners and help them if possible. In Jakarta, he corresponded with Sudirman, Hamengkubuwono IX, Oerip Soemohardjo, Suryadi Suryadarma, and M. Nazir. He was Chief of the DPKN police office in Surabaya, East Java in 1952. He became the chief of BARESKRIM in Medan, North Sumatra in 1956. In 1959, he followed the Mobile Brigade(BRIMOB) training school and became a directorate staff II in the national police headquarters in 1960, he became the chief of the Immigration & customs in 1960, became the Minister of Economics in 1965, and became the Ministry of Secretary in the main cabinet in 1966. After Hoegeng resigned as the police chief, he performed on TVRI playing Hawaiian guitar together with \\"The Hawaiian Seniors\\" band, and hosted The Hawaiian Seniors music show (originally Irama Lautan Teduh) from 1968 until 1979. Sometimes he performed with his wife, Merry Hoegeng and his daughter, Reny Hoegeng or Aditya Hoegeng.

It was established on March 20, 1992. The name of the park means Russian North in Russian. The park protects natural and cultural landscapes around Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery and Ferapontov Monastery, places of great historical significance. History In the 13th century, the area was part of the Principality of Beloozero, and in the 14th century, together with the principality, entered the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1397, St. Cyril of White Lake, a monk and a disciple of St. Sergius of Radonezh, founded the Kirillo-Belozersky monastery on the shore of Lake Siverskoye. The town of Kirillov eventually developed as the posad of the monastery. In 1398, St. Therapont of White Lake, who arrived with Cyril, moved to a separate location, which later became the Ferapontov Monastery. Both monasteries were subordinate to Archbishops of Rostov. In the 15th and the 16th century, Kirillo-Belozersky monastery developed into one of the most influential monasteries in Russia. It also helped that the Sheksna River was one of the most heavily used waterways connecting central and northern Russia. At some point, it was the second biggest landowner after the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius. Vasili III of Russia, the Grand Prince of Moscow, and Ivan the Terrible, the Tsar, visited the monastery on several occasions. In the end of the 15th century, Nil Sorsky, a former monk of the monastery and a leader of Non-possessors movement in Russian Orthodox Church, founded the Nilo-Sorsky Monastery northwest of Kirillov. All these monasteries are currently located within the limits of the park. In 1980s, the concept of national parks, which did not previously exist in Soviet Union, was developed, and Vologda Oblast was asked to create one national park. Whereas the initial choice was to create the park in Vytegorsky District in the northwest of the oblast, to protect its karst landscapes, the area was finally decided to be too remote for mass tourism, and the location of the park was moved to Kirillovsky District. The project of the park was developed in 1989-1990, and the national park was established in 1992. Location and geography The national park is located in the southern part of Kirillovsky District, about northeast of Vologda, east of Lake Beloye and northwest of Lake Kubenskoye. Only 45.6% of the area of the park actually belong to the park. Any activity related to production is prohibited in this part of the park. The rest of the park has not been alienated and is in use, mostly as agricultural lands. In particular, the town of Kirillov is located within the park. The national park also includes Kirillo-Belozyorsky, Ferapontov, and Goritsky Monasteries, as well as stretches of the Northern Dvina Canal and the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway. Woods occupy 69.8% of the park area, swamps additionally occupy 7.1%. Most of the area is essentially hilly landscapes of glacial origin. Several hills, such as Maura Hill, Sandyreva Hill, and Tsypina Hill, are protected as natural monuments. There are two more protected natural monuments. Sokolsky Bor is an area covered by pinewood forest and located on the bank of the Sheksna Reservoir. Shalgo-Bodunovsky Les is a forested area with limited access which protects the remains of spruce and pine pristine forest which is almost extinct in Vologda Oblast. Tourism The town of Kirillov with the Kirillo- Belozersky Monastery, as well as the Ferapontov and the Goritsky Monasteries are acclaimed tourist attractions located within the limits of the park. The Ferapontov Monastery has been recognized in 2000 as a World Heritage site. All these attractions are accessible by roads. In particular, the paved roads between Vologda and Kirillov, and between Vologda and Vytegra cross the area of the park.

It was released on February 21, 2012 through Fueled by Ramen, a subsidiary of major label Warner Music Group. It was recorded in 2011 and produced by Jeff Bhasker. After signing to a new label, the band began to work on Some Nights for over nine months throughout 2011. \\"We Are Young\\" was released as the lead single from the album and bolstered the band to mainstream success with the aid of television and advertising. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks and Alternative Songs for two weeks, with over six million digital downloads. The title track was commissioned as the second single and has reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling 6.8 million digital downloads as well as becoming their second No. 1 on Alternative Songs. The album has received mixed reviews according to Metacritic. The band later won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, and \\"We Are Young\\" won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Fun received four other Grammy nominations: two for \\"We Are Young\\" and two for the album itself. Background Fun. signed to Fueled by Ramen in late 2010. Lead vocalist Nate Ruess, who had apprehensions about joining a major label in the past, recalled the switch being \\"very, very easy\\" for the group, stating that both parties approached it as if they \\"knew what [they] were getting into with each other.\\" The transition was in the works with the label for almost nine months, when the head of the label reached out to the band. Ruess was flattered that employed workers for the label would buy their own tickets to Fun. shows and \\"talk about us with the passion you'd generally reserve for an artist you're working with.\\" After lengthy discussions within the band, the band decided to give the label a try. Ruess recalls that he was listening to \\"so much hip-hop\\" during the production that it became a big influence for him, specifically Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The band felt inspired and gradually began working on new songs, each carrying an obvious hip-hop influence. Consciously, the band began working in the hip-hop factor and realized they wanted a hip-hop producer. After scanning the liner notes of his other hip-hop records, Ruess noticed that Jeff Bhasker was one of the most common names. Bhasker was preoccupied at the time working with Beyonc√© but Ruess was persistent in meeting with him. Recording and production The most common creative process in the recording of Some Nights began with Ruess. Ruess would come in with lyrics and a melody, leading Andrew Dost and guitarist Jack Antonoff to build chord structure and instrumentation from there, or \\"support that melody\\". Dost noted that in recording, despite the composer's well-defined framework, the individuals' egos \\"pretty much disappear\\" and \\"everybody is happy to work towards the best possible song\\" cohesively together. The dynamic between Bhasker and the band in the studio was mutually inspired, as Bhasker had never worked with a rock band before and Fun had never worked with a hip-hop producer. Bhasker particularly enjoyed recording guitars with guitarist Jack Antonoff as he wasn't used to it, and Dost felt hearing Bhasker compose beats was \\"mind- blowing\\". The emphasis for Ruess on Some Nights was to make the songs more cohesive, as he felt his writing was \\"all over the place\\". This meant creating songs that were concise instead of being \\"long and drawn out\\". Bhasker was a proponent of using a single instrument to provide the biggest sounds, desiring not to \\"over-cram [the] songs with ideas,\\" declaring that everything that makes the song must be well-chosen. Janelle Mon√°e collaborated with the trio on \\"We Are Young\\" through a friendship with Bhasker. Bhasker was credited with bringing the band a bigger sound and an entirely new sonic translation to the band not present on their debut, Aim and Ignite. The album creates a mix of indie pop, theatric rock, and hip-hop‚Äîa sound that is credited to Bhasker. Some Nights as a title floated around before any songs for the album were even created and was envisioned by Ruess. It was inspired by how personalities can change on any given night. Although the album isn't a concept album, the title changed the band's ideas for the album considerably, with Dost stating, \\"It's really nice once you have a title to know what the parameters are of what you're working on as a whole.\\" The band completed production on the album in October 2011. Ruess called the seven months spent recording the record the most rewarding of any in his ten years of professional music work, calling it his career highlight. Composition The album and the band's music has received several comparisons to Queen. Rolling Stone's Jody Rosen, called the album a mix of \\"close harmony chorales, showy key changes, a dash of Queen here, a dollop of Les Miz there\\". In an interview with Fuse, producer Jeff Bhasker also stated that the album's lead single \\"We Are Young\\" \\"had a Queen/Freddie Mercury vibe to it\\". Marcus Glimer of The A.V. Club wrote that the album featured \\"more synthetic elements [keyboards and drum machines]\\" than their debut album Aim and Ignite, and compared the beat to \\"All Alone\\" to a hip-hop track. NPR columnist Daoud Tyler-Ameen commented that the album might be the start of a new phase of music, in which musicians would infuse the \\"sounds and rhythms once associated with hip-hop\\" with their pop music. The album's lyrics have been called \\"plaintive\\", for dealing with themes of loneliness, self-worth, introspection, paranoia and existentialism, contrasting with the album's \\"anthemic\\" music. Tyler-Ameen considered the album \\"remarkable for its sheer optimism\\", despite the sad and mournful lyrics, Rosen wrote that \\"Ruess' knack for the anthemic is matched by Gen-Y humor ‚Äì emo self-deprecation that leavens the bombast\\". while Marcus Gilmer praised Ruess' \\"prose-style lyrics\\", similar to his work in his previous band, The Format. Ruess later commented on the importance of lyrics to him, saying that he took \\"great pride\\" after he finished writing them. He also considered most lyrics written by current musicians to be \\"dumbed down\\", partially causing \\"rock music's current woes\\". Promotion The album's lead single, \\"We Are Young\\", was highly successful, and bolstered the band into mainstream popularity in early 2012. The song caught attention through the Fox television series Glee covering it. The band was in shock at the news, with Dost saying that \\"that's just one of the coolest things that could possibly have happened.\\" Glee's cover of \\"We Are Young\\" was the show's highest selling debut single of their season and connected their listening audience to the band. Even after being benefited by the high-profile cover, \\"We Are Young\\" became the soundtrack to a Chevrolet spot that aired during Super Bowl XLVI, which brought Fun. to a type of exposure that Billboard noted \\"few current bands receive.\\" The Chevrolet advertisement was credited by the Los Angeles Times for the song's chart success on iTunes: it went to number one on the Hot Digital Songs chart a week before the album's release. The song was performed on the MTV Movie Awards on June 4, 2012 alongside Janelle Mon√°e. As a thank- you to their fans for their support of the band, Fun. streamed Some Nights in advance on their official website a week before the album's release. November 3, 2012, the band performed \\"Some Nights\\" and \\"Carry On\\" on Saturday Night Live, to promote the release of both singles. \\"All Alone\\" was performed on Alan Carr: Chatty Man on April 19, and was released as the fifth and final single from the album on May 13, 2013 in the United Kingdom. Critical reception Some Nights received mixed to positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, based on 21 reviews, which indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen complimented the album's \\"classic bubble-pop tunefulness with rococo rock & roll\\". Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Adam Knott wrote, \\"The energy and personality which flood out of every melody give this album its own stamp of authority. It tips over into excess at rare moments, but even as you can hear those moments happening, they provoke grins inside and out.\\" Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly was less positive, criticizing the album's second half as being inferior to the first. Morgan Troper of PopMatters wrote that \\"in a bizarre, inverted way, Some Nights is Nate Ruess coming into his own as a singer and songwriter,\\" but was critical of Ruess' use of pop music conventions in the album's songs. The album was listed at number 43 on Rolling Stones list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying \\"Ruess' emo sweetness and self-doubting humor make Some Nights a castle you could feel at home in.\\" Commercial performance The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 70,000 copies in the United States. The album has been certified Platinum and has sold over 1.6 million copies as of February 2015. In the UK it sold 310,000 copies in 2012. The album's lead single \\"We Are Young\\", became the first multi-member band debut to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Nickelback's \\"How You Remind Me\\" in December 2001. It also earned a footnote in chart history by becoming the first, and only, tune that has ever gained more than 300,000 downloads a week for seven weeks straight, topping three million downloads in all.http://www.theimproper.com/music/8045/nate- ruess-band-fun-explodes-giving-indie-rock-major-lift/ Track listing Deluxe edition #\\"Out on the Town\\" ‚Äì 4:21 #\\"We Are Young\\" (featuring Janelle Mon√°e) (acoustic) ‚Äì 4:32 #\\"Carry On\\" (acoustic) ‚Äì 4:08 #\\"Why Am I the One\\" (acoustic) ‚Äì 4:22 #\\"We Are Young\\" (featuring Janelle Mon√°e) (Alvin Risk remix) ‚Äì 4:09 Personnel Fun * Jack Antonoff ‚Äì guitars, vocals, bass guitar, drums, percussion, programming, arrangement * Andrew Dost ‚Äì keyboards, piano, celeste, synthesizer, glockenspiel, guitar, bass guitar, accordion, drums, percussion, programming, trumpet, flugelhorn, vocals, design, arrangement * Nate Ruess ‚Äì lead vocals, background vocals, arrangement, sampler Charts =Weekly charts= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2012‚Äì13) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian Albums Chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Austrian Albums Chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"11 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"32 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"52 - !scope=\\"row\\"Canadian Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5 - !scope=\\"row\\"Danish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"22 - !scope=\\"row\\"Dutch Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"29 - !scope=\\"row\\"Finnish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"50 - !scope=\\"row\\"French Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"37 - !scope=\\"row\\"German Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"30 - !scope=\\"row\\"Irish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"8 - !scope=\\"row\\"Italian Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"25 - !scope=\\"row\\"Japanese Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"12 - !scope=\\"row\\"Mexican Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"87 - !scope=\\"row\\"New Zealand Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3 - !scope=\\"row\\"Norwegian Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4 - !scope=\\"row\\"Portuguese Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"27 - !scope=\\"row\\"South African Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swedish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"36 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swiss Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"16 - !scope=\\"row\\"Spanish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"69 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Albums Chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"4 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"3 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Rock Albums  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Alternative Albums  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard Vinyl Albums  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 } =Year-end charts= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Chart (2012) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian Albums Chart 28 - !scope=\\"row\\"Dutch Albums Chart 95 - !scope=\\"row\\"Italian Albums Chart style=\\"text-align:center;\\"100 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Albums Chart 23 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200 20 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Digital Albums Chart  5 - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2013) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian Albums Chart 77 - !scope=\\"row\\"New Zealand Albums Chart 22 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200 23 } =Decade-end charts= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2010‚Äì2019) ! scope=\\"col\\" Position - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Billboard 200  63 } Certifications References Category:2012 albums Category:Albums produced by Jeff Bhasker Category:Albums produced by Emile Haynie Category:Albums produced by Jake One Category:Fueled by Ramen albums Category:Fun (band) albums ","title":"Some Nights (album)"},{"id":"33674985","text":"El Encuentro is a live album by Argentine bandoneon player and composer Dino Saluzzi with cellist Anja Lechner and The Metropole Orchestra recorded in 2009 and released on the ECM label.ECM discography accessed November 8, 2011 Reception The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating \\"El Encuentro (\\"The Meeting\\") is a series of musical short stories that ultimately become an entire narrative\\".Jurek, T.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and the Queensland Legislative Council. Early life Born in Mauchline in Ayrshire to coachman Peter Murray and Jean, n√©e Witherspoon, he was educated locally and emigrated to the Victorian goldfields around 1852. In 1862 he and his brothers established a cattle shipping business in New South Wales, operating between Newcastle and New Zealand, although the latter's prohibition of cattle imports in 1864 due to pleuropneumonia in Australia ended the venture. In December of that year Murray relocated to Rockhampton, selecting around of land and growing sugarcane from 1872. On 1 September 1873, Murray married Jane Elizabeth Hartley; they had three children, but Jane died in 1877. On 3 January 1882 Murray married Margaret McGavin, with whom he had four children Political life John Murray was an early member of the Gogango Divisional Board, serving as chairman on three occasions. In 1888 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Normanby, supporting Thomas McIlwraith's group. He resigned from parliament in November 1903 to contest the Australian Senate, but he was unsuccessful. During the campaign Murray described Labor's control of the balance of power in the Australian Parliament as \\"government from the gutter\\". His own politics were largely conservative, although he long prevaricated on the issue of separation for Central Queensland. In 1890 he finally declared his support for separation and declined a seat in the Griffith-McIlwraith coalition ministry. He entered cabinet in 1898 as secretary for railways and public works under T. J. Byrnes and later James Dickson. In 1901 he was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council and served as secretary for public instruction until August 1902 and minister without portfolio under Robert Philp until his retirement in 1903. Later life Following his defeat in the federal election he retired to return to pastoralism, purchasing Beaconsfield East and West stations at Ilfracombe in 1911. He later lived mostly at his residence Tullibardine at 148 Merthyr Road, New Farm, Brisbane. Around September‚ÄìOctober 1917, John Murray travelled to his property Beaconsfield Station in the Longreach district. On 18 November 1917 he died in the private hospital of Dr Michod in Longreach after a short illness, aged 76 years old. He was buried in Longreach Cemetery but was re-interred in Toowong Cemetery on 22 March 1919.

Goals and efforts In general objective, the ACE program is motivated by and addresses the same issues as the MUC program that preceded it. The ACE program, however, defines the research objectives in terms of the target objects (i.e., the entities, the relations, and the events) rather than in terms of the words in the text. For example, the so-called \\"named entity\\" task, as defined in MUC, is to identify those words (on the page) that are names of entities. In ACE, on the other hand, the corresponding task is to identify the entity so named. This is a different task, one that is more abstract and that involves inference more explicitly in producing an answer. In a real sense, the task is to detect things that \\"aren't there\\". While the ACE program is directed toward extraction of information from audio and image sources in addition to pure text, the research effort is restricted to information extraction from text. The actual transduction of audio and image data into text is not part of the ACE research effort, although the processing of ASR and OCR output from such transducers is. The effort involves: * defining the research tasks in detail, * collecting and annotating data needed for training, development, and evaluation, * supporting the research with evaluation tools and research workshops. Topics and exercises Given a text in natural language, the ACE challenge is to detect: # entities mentioned in the text, such as: persons, organizations, locations, facilities, weapons, vehicles, and geo-political entities. # relations between entities, such as: person A is the manager of company B. Relation types include: role, part, located, near, and social. # events mentioned in the text, such as: interaction, movement, transfer, creation and destruction. The program relates to English, Arabic and Chinese texts. The ACE corpus is one of the standard benchmarks for testing new information extraction algorithms.

It is named after the \\"quicker sort\\" algorithm (a quicksort variant due to R. S. Scowen), which was originally used to implement it in the Unix C library, although the C standard does not require it to implement quicksort. Implementations of the qsort function achieve polymorphism, the ability to sort different kinds of data, by taking a function pointer to a three-way comparison function, as well as a parameter that specifies the size of its individual input objects. The C standard requires the comparison function to implement a total order on the items in the input array.ISO/IEC 9899:201x, Programming Languages‚ÄîC (draft). ¬ß7.22.5. November 16, 2010.  History  A qsort function was implemented by Lee McMahon in 1972. It was in place in Version 3 Unix as a library function, but was then an assembler subroutine. A C version, with roughly the interface of the standard C version, was in-place in Version 6 Unix. It was rewritten in 1983 for BSD. The function was standardized in ANSI C (1989). In 1991, Bell Labs employees observed that McMahon's and BSD versions of qsort would consume quadratic time for some simple inputs. Thus Jon Bentley and Douglas McIlroy engineered a new faster and more robust implementation. Example The following piece of C code shows how to sort a list of integers using qsort. #include /* Comparison function. Receives two generic (void) pointers to the items under comparison. */ int compare_ints(const void *p, const void *q) { int x = *(const int *)p; int y = *(const int *)q; /* Avoid return x - y, which can cause undefined behaviour because of signed integer overflow. */ if (x < y) return -1; // Return -1 if you want ascending, 1 if you want descending order. else if (x > y) return 1; // Return 1 if you want ascending, -1 if you want descending order. return 0; // All the logic is often alternatively written: return (x > y) - (x < y); } /* Sort an array of n integers, pointed to by a. */ void sort_ints(int *a, size_t n) { qsort(a, n, sizeof(*a), compare_ints); } References Category:C standard library Category:Sorting algorithms ","title":"Qsort"},{"id":"33675100","text":"Laxmi Vilas Palace(Built By Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III), Vadodara Hridaya Kunj in Sabarmati Ashram Asiatic lion at Gir Gira falls Pavagath Hill in Panchmahal, Gujarat Statue of Unity is the tallest statue in the world.

Tricking is a training discipline that combines kicks with flips and twists from gymnastics as well as many dance moves and styles from breakdancing. It aims to achieve an aesthetic display of different combinations of \\"tricks\\". Tricking practitioners are commonly referred to as trickers. Examples of tricking techniques include the 540 kick, the corkscrew (cork), the flashkick, the butterfly twist and the double leg. History A tendency to exhibit techniques that are more flashy and complex was observed in martial arts during the period following the 1960s, predating the current tricking movement. Especially in taekwondo, an increasing emphasis on spectacular spinning, jumping or flying kicks developed during the mid-1960s with the introduction of international competitions. The actual sport of tricking is an internet phenomenon, emerging in the early 2000s. Xtreme Martial Arts is thought to be a close precursor to the sport, being shown at various martial arts tournaments in the 90s and early 2000s. By late 2003, the online tricking community was well-developed, bringing trickers from across the globe together. With the rise of YouTube, trickers were able to share their videos with others, and the discipline experienced a massive rise in popularity and interest. Since the beginning of 2008, tricking has been receiving much wider publicity and popularity among the general public due to efforts of popular tricking teams. Progression A tricker demonstrates a characteristic tricking move, the Corkscrew. Unlike many established sports, tricking has no formal rules or regulations, and there are no governing bodies that regulate the sport. Strictly speaking, participants are free to perform any kind of dramatic maneuver and call it a 'trick' - though there are certain moves that are generally accepted as tricking moves. Some practitioners (especially those who discover tricking through the Internet) tend to learn the easier moves first (such as the 540 kick, aerial, kip-up, and backflip) and try to progress through a list of recognized tricks in the perceived order of difficulty. However, how difficult a trick is, varies from person to person; certain tricks may be inexplicably easier or harder than normal for a particular tricker to learn. Trickers can be divided into different categories of style: some prefer performing mainly martial arts tricks (which almost always incorporate kicks into a trick), others mostly freestyle gymnastics and flips (mainly focus on combining different types of rotations and twists), but most trickers combine moves from both of the disciplines. Trickers regularly train their bodies hard to be able to perform their tricks at any time consistently. Training A tricker performing a combination of tricks. The majority of trickers are self-taught or have partaken in similar sports such as martial arts or gymnastics. Trickers usually learn from friends or other individuals who have more experience than themselves, or by reproducing movements seen in videos. Trickers often form \\"teams\\" of friends, and some attend tricking camps and gatherings. Tricking's popularity has increased over the years bringing some facilities and gymnastics centers to coach tricking, and in recent years some martial arts and gymnastics studios in big cities feature classes for tricking. Practitioners usually perform the majority of their tricks on grass or plyometric flooring. Foam landing mats, trampolines, or jumping jamborees are utilized to become familiar with new movements in a safe environment. In addition to practicing the moves of tricking, many trickers improve their physical fitness and undergo body conditioning and strength training, as many of the movements within the activity require a high level of strength. Dynamic and static flexibility training is also commonly practiced by trickers due to the upper range of motion many tricks require.

Gatherings Since its inception, gatherings have been a regular part of the tricking community. Organized by trickers, usually with the assistance of online forums, gatherings are an opportunity for individual trickers to showcase their styles and seek advice from other trickers. Gatherings usually have one or more Gym Sessions, where a gymnastics studio is rented out specifically for the gathering. In addition, there are also mini-gatherings (also known as seminars/sessions) that usually take place in grassy fields. Compared to regular gatherings where trickers from all over the world attend, mini- gatherings generally attract local trickers to a one-day session. This in turn allows local trickers to meet, trick together, strengthen tricking in their own communities, and help expose it to more people in their local area. Team tricking Trickers sometimes make teams and practice together, but often perform together as well. Many teams choreograph demos which they then perform at events. Not only do the demos promote their teams, they also bring tricking out into the light for the rest of the world. Some trickers choose to pair up with other trickers at competitions and perform. Teams often organize open tricking sessions and gatherings. Some examples of teams are: Loopkicks, Club540 online community Media exposure Since its rise in popularity, tricking has been featured in various media. * Anis Cheurfa, a French professional trickster, portrayed the masked antagonist Rinzler in the 2010 film Tron: Legacy, utilizing tricking in combat. * Jacob Pinto, a three-time Red Bull Tricking Champion, has been featured tricking in television, film, and commercials, such as Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris, Blackish and The Voice with CeeLo Green. * Arrow, the DC television series played on the CW, showcased fight scenes by actress Caity Lotz, who portrays Sara Lance in the series. * Daredevil, the marvel television series, showcased fight scenes which incorporated tricking as well as many other martial arts * Got7, a South Korean boy group under JYP Entertainment is famous for using tricking as part of their choreography. * Andy Le, an American trickster who is known for his videos on his YouTube channel Martial Club, he was also a winner of the Red Bull Kick It competition See also *Parkour *Freerunning References Category:Gymnastics Category:Martial art techniques Category:Parkour techniques ","title":"Tricking (martial arts)"},{"id":"33675182","text":"Perth Academy is a state comprehensive secondary school in Perth, Scotland. It was founded in 1696. The institution is a non-denominational one. The school occupies ground on the side of a hill in the Viewlands area of Perth, and is within the Perth and Kinross Council area. History The old Academy building, situated just over two miles to the northeast of today's structure While able to claim a strong connection to the Perth Grammar School founded in the twelfth century, the name Perth Academy first appears in 1542 when it was founded by the town council, still making Perth Academy one of the oldest schools in Scotland. The first Rector of the school was the Honourable John Murray (later Duke of Atholl); at this time it was considered a purely honourable title, before later being given to the head teacher of the school. By April 1762 accommodation was first provided for the school, in the form of a two-storey building which occupied the site of the current city hall. At this time education in Perth was provided by a variety of smaller institutions each specialising in a particular field. By the 1800s it was felt that the disparate nature of these, often cramped, buildings was detrimental to the efficiency and success of the schools. This, combined with a new appreciation of the value of education, led to a new building being built to house the different schools. Designed by Robert Reid, later the King's architect, work on this building was started in October 1803, and finished for the start of the teaching year in 1807. The building housed the Academy (at the time specialising mostly in Maths and the sciences), the Grammar (specialising in mostly Classics, History and Philosophy), the English School, the French school, the Drawing and Painting school, and the Writing school. Together they were known as the public Seminaries, and were housed on Rose Terrace, near the North Inch of Perth. John Rhind's Britannia and the clock on the old Academy building in Rose Terrace This arrangement was continued until 1892, when, under the terms of the 1878 Education Act, control of the schools was transferred from the council to the newly created school board. At this point the term Seminaries was no longer used and the institution began to be officially termed Perth Academy, with the other schools being termed as departments within the school in the 1873 prospectus. Teachers were still paid separately and collected their share of the tuition fees directly from the students in their classes. In 1881 that this was changed, with the fees going into a central treasury before being redistributed. In 1915 the Academy was amalgamated with the rival Sharp's institution, also located in Perth, leading to a decrease in the fees paid by students. The school moved to its present site at Viewlands in 1932, construction on the building having begun in 1930. The buildings were designed by the Edinburgh architects, and school specialists, Reid & Forbes, one of their late classical works. Up to 1968 the school was a selective senior secondary school with entrants being required to sit an entrance exam. At this time the schools had a large catchment area of over 642 square miles and including Dunkeld, Kinross, Errol, and Methven. In 1971 the school become a comprehensive school serving all pupils within a smaller catchment area. Large extensions were added to the school in 1990, including a separate building for a Gymnasium and Games Hall, as well as workshops and an Art studio. The science labs were also renovated at this time with computing rooms being added and suites created for the music and business departments. Grounds and facilities Perth Academy and playing fields Perth Academy is situated in the middle of extensive grounds, stretching to some 11.93Ha, a large part of which comprises sports pitches. The campus is shared with Viewlands Primary School, with many students attending both during their education, and Fairview School, an additional support needs school. The main building for Perth Academy holds all the schools classrooms across two floors, including several science labs, computer rooms, carpentry and metal working rooms, and kitchens for the teaching of cookery. The school canteen is in a separate, smaller building which outside lunch times also serves as a gym room and holds a suite of exercise equipment such as treadmills. There is also a separate block housing the Physical Education department which includes two indoor areas for gym and sports activities. A map of the world has also been painted on the playground as a part of the World at your Feet project run by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society aimed at encouraging the education of school children in geography. In 2014 construction started on a new all- weather pitch, despite resistance from many of the pupils, as the construction meant the removal and destruction of a Scots Pine tree, older than the school itself. The pitch was finished in time for the start of the 2014/15 Summer Term, fully kitted out with football and hockey goals and painted with appropriate pitch lines. Curriculum The school follows the national curriculum for Scotland, including the teaching of cooking and technical subjects. In line with Scottish Parliament education policy the school is moving to the new Curriculum for Excellence. As well as the subjects taught within the school, Perth Academy has established links with other education establishments in Perth including Perth High School and Perth College. These links allow the school to indirectly offer courses outwith its usual capacity to teach. Extracurricular activities The school provides a wide range of activities for students and was praised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education for the development of young people through these activities. The school regularly fields teams for, and hosts, events including hockey and rugby, as well as competing in athletics at county sport level. The school also tries to help develop skills in the pupils as team leaders through activities such as a Sports Leader course and by giving pupils the chance to help lead sports sessions at the neighbouring Viewlands Primary and Fairview schools. There is also netball, table tennis,basketball, badminton, gymnastics, a cheerleading squad and dancing. The school also runs an award- winning \\"school of rugby\\"programme for S1 & S2 pupils.

Glycoside hydrolases are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for glycoside hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition of >100 different families.Bairoch, A. \\"Classification of glycosyl hydrolase families and index of glycosyl hydrolase entries in SWISS-PROT\\". 1999. This classification is available on the CAZy web site, and also discussed at CAZypedia, an online encyclopedia of carbohydrate active enzymes. Glycoside hydrolase family 36 together with family 31 and family 27 alpha-galactosidases form the glycosyl hydrolase clan GH-D, a superfamily of alpha-galactosidases, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases, and isomaltodextranases which are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism and structural topology. Alpha- galactosidase () (melibiase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of melibiose into galactose and glucose. In man, the deficiency of this enzyme is the cause of Fabry's disease (X-linked sphingolipidosis). Alpha-galactosidase is present in a variety of organisms. There is a considerable degree of similarity in the sequence of alpha-galactosidase from various eukaryotic species. Escherichia coli alpha-galactosidase (gene melA), which requires NAD and magnesium as cofactors, is not structurally related to the eukaryotic enzymes; by contrast, an Escherichia coli plasmid encoded alpha-galactosidase (gene rafA ) contains a region of about 50 amino acids which is similar to a domain of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase () catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D- galactosaminides. In man, the deficiency of this enzyme is the cause of Schindler and Kanzaki diseases. The sequence of this enzyme is highly related to that of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases. This family also includes raffinose synthase proteins, also known as seed inhibition (Sip1) proteins. Raffinose (O-alpha- D-galactopyranosyl- (1-->6)- O-alpha- D-glucopyranosyl-(1<\\\\-->2)- O-beta- D-fructofuranoside) is a widespread oligosaccharide in plant seeds and other tissues. Raffinose synthase is the key enzyme that channels sucrose into the raffinose oligosaccharide pathway. Glycoside hydrolase family 36 also includes enzymes with Œ±-N- acetylgalactosaminidase and stachyose synthase activities. Glycoside hydrolase family 36 can be subdivided into 11 families, GH36A to GH36K.

He was a man of vision and determination, and a colourful character.  Early life  William Francis Buttle ‚Äì always \\"Frank\\" to his family ‚Äì was born in Brixton on 19 October 1878. He was a son of William Buttle, a solicitor, and his wife, Mary Wilby, daughter of William Henry Ward, a builder. Soon after Frank‚Äôs birth, the family moved to Woldingham, near Croydon, and Frank was educated at Whitgift Grammar School. Having first trained as a solicitor, his real ambition was to become a clergyman, and he went first to the University of Durham and then to Downing College, Cambridge. He was ordained in 1906 and served in a number of parishes. He was vicar of St Chad‚Äôs, Haggerston, in the London Borough of Hackney, from 1937 to 1953, when he died. In December 1950, the Sunday Dispatch wrote of him: =A Vocation to Address Child Welfare Issues= Frank Buttle was perhaps the first person to challenge the abuses of baby farming ‚Äì the taking in of infants to nurse for payment ‚Äì and to offer the very practical alternative of adoption. On the outbreak of war in August 1914, Frank Buttle determined to devote himself to child welfare work, especially in connection with children rendered homeless and orphaned through the war. He formed the National Adoption Society, and by 1930, 3,000 adoptions had been arranged and a home for unmarried mothers was established in Surrey. It was later renamed and ultimately merged with Parents and Children Together =The Foundation of The Frank Buttle Trust= As the years went on, Buttle's activities brought to his notice large numbers of children for whom no adopters could be found, and his thoughts ran to helping their mothers themselves to bring them up, in addition to continuing to help adopted and orphaned children. A complete ascetic and financial genius, he set about raising ¬£1 million to create an endowment that would launch 1000 children into life each year. When he died in 1953, he was only ¬£80,000 short of his objective. Later that year, the full amount was raised and the two \\"Buttle Trusts\\" he had originally established in 1937 were amalgamated and became operational. His brother Gladwin Buttle, physician and pharmacologist, acted as chairman of the trust from 1953 to 1974. In March 2011, The Frank Buttle Trust changed its name to Buttle UK. The endowment is worth almost ¬£50m and provides around ¬£1m of income each year that supports the charity's running costs.

The school taught girls from the age of 3 up to 18 and contained a pre-prep, preparatory, senior and sixth form. The school was established in 1859 with funding from Thomas Howell's trustees who later established Howell's School Llandaff in 1860. The school had many facilities including a sports hall, 120 acres of grounds and an equestrian centre. In the 2011 Telegraph Independent League Table results Howell's School came 298th in the UK with 22.03% A* Grade and 45.79% A* or A grade. Following some years of decline in numbers, and a series of tribunals involving staff wrongfully dismissed amid allegations of poor management, the school announced on 2 August 2013 that it would not be reopening for the next academic year citing financial difficulties as the primary reason, although this is disputed. The school went into liquidation on 22 August 2013 following a meeting with creditors. A new co-educational independent school, Myddelton College, opened on the site in 2016.  History  Thomas Howell was a Welshman and a merchant draper of the city of London who made his fortune trading with Spain and Portugal from 1519 to 1527. When he died in 1537, he bestowed in his will 12,000 golden ducats (about ¬£2,200,000) to the Drapers' Company, the proceeds of which were to be given every year for ever to four maiden orphans of his lineage. If such could not be found, then to other maiden orphans at the discretion of the Master and Wardens.Stone, M.K. Howell's School Denbigh. Denbighshire Historical Society Transactions, 8, 1959, pages 157 - 162 Howell's rear in the snow The Drapers' Company had great difficulty in getting this money from Spain. Eventually, in 1541, ¬£570 was received in cash as well as a consignment of wine and oil, which was sold to young men of the Company. There still remained a large sum of money to be recovered and the services of the Bishop of London were enlisted. The money was invested in freehold property in the City of London.The difficulty of the administering the Trust began at once, because it was usually hard to find orphan maidens of Howell‚Äôs kin. In the year 1853, more than three hundred years after the death of Thomas Howell, an Act of Parliament was passed, empowering the Court of Chancery to extend the Trust to the establishment of girls‚Äô schools in Wales. Two girls‚Äô schools in Llandaff and Denbigh were built in 1858, and were both carried on by the Drapers‚Äô Company. The School was originally built for fifty-five boarders and fifty day girls. A system of houses was afterwards begun, in addition to the original block of buildings. There were three; Haulfryn, Bodgwilym and Minffordd. In 1914 a wing was built, containing additional classrooms, music rooms, gymnasium and an Assembly Hall which has now become the Library. In 1931, another milestone was reached with the opening of extensive new buildings, the Great Hall, the Dining Hall and Kitchens, and three new Houses; St George‚Äôs, St Andrew‚Äôs and St Patrick‚Äôs. From time to time many other improvements have been made, such as a sports pavilion, swimming bath, and tennis courts.More than 400 years of school tradition; advertisement feature. Country Quest, Volume 19, Number 9, February 1979, pages 74 - 80  Facilities  The school held extensive grounds backing onto the Denbighshire countryside including a sports hall with climbing and abseiling facilities, caving, orienteering and an outdoor swimming pool. It also housed its own equestrian centre with several arenas, jumping and livery facilities. Controversies The school was run by H2000, directors Robbie and Nicola Locke, who give their main residence as the Cayman Islands.http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/howells-school- denbigh-shut-amid-5584297 In June 2012 Rebecca Raven, an art teacher, won an unfair dismissal case against the school after an application for maternity leave. The school claimed that Raven had been employed to cover a teacher with long term sickness who had since decided not to return. A subsequent audit had shown only a part-time post was required, which Raven declined. They had been unaware that she was pregnant. However the tribunal believed the real cause was the \\"extremely precarious\\" state of the school finances and that the school did not want to \\"waste money on maternity pay\\". Dr Philip Dixon, of ATL Cymru, stated that: The school was considering an appeal. Raven was awarded over ¬£33000 in compensation from the case but had yet to receive any money.http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/atl-cymru-hits-out- howells-5615166 In March 2013 sacked headmaster Bernie Routledge and teacher Helen Price both won their cases for unfair dismissal. The tribunal chairman found that there was no evidence that either had deserved their sackings. He described the disciplinary procedure undergone by Routledge (which was carried out by the brother of Robbie Locke, a school trustee) as \\"cack-handed\\" and \\"chaotic\\", saying the panel felt the dismissals were as a result of issues raised by Routledge regarding the conduct of a member of staff who was a good friend of Robbie and Nicola Locke (both trustees of the school) who allegedly pressured staff to fill out inspection questionnaires dishonestly. Routledge also aired concerns about irregularities in pension payments. The head teacher told the tribunal that during a break Nicola Locke had called him a paedophile.The tribunal ruled that both teachers were entitled to \\"substantial\\" damages. On 12 September Routledge was awarded ¬£217000 and Price ¬£84000. Another member of staff, senior mistress Morwen Murray, was awarded damages in September 2013 for unlawful deduction of earnings after she took sick leave. She was sacked the day before the school announced its closure and was pursuing a further claim. The NASUWT have pursued nearly ten claims against the school (as of September 2013) and have won every one. The school announced that it would be closing on 2 August 2013. An independent auditor's report in August 2012 outlined concerns which cast doubt on the ability of the school to remain a going concern. On 22 August the school went into liquidation, calling into question the payment of awards still owing to staff (Rebecca Raven, Bernie Routledge and Helen Price among others) and other creditors. The NASUWT alleged that the bankruptcy was brought about because the school had been operating rent-free until the Lockes insisted on charging rent, changing the balance sheet substantially.

Biography and career  Heymann was born in Frankfurt, Germany, and studied Romance languages and English at the Universities of Frankfurt and Lisbon, at King's College London and finally at the Sorbonne in Paris. To pay his way through university he worked as a tennis coach. He worked in advertising sales and special supplement production for an American newspaper in his native Frankfurt, then worked in international marketing for Braun AG. He first went to Hong Kong in 1967 to start up the office of the Overseas Weekly, the American newspaper he had worked for in Frankfurt. He \\"arrived with a suitcase and a typewriter, and strangely enough the hotel which had been booked for me didn't exist anymore.\\" He subsequently created a direct-mail advertising business, then a mail-order company providing goods to members of the United States military in Vietnam. He sold such items as cameras, watches and audio equipment, including Bose speakers and Revox tape recorders. Following the end of the war in Vietnam, Heymann became the Hong Kong distributor for Bose and Revox, and, later, Studer recording studio equipment. He began organizing classical music concerts to help boost the sales of the brands he sold. When Heymann found that many of the musicians who performed at these concerts could not find their recordings in Hong Kong record shops, he started importing a number of classical record labels, including Vox-Turnabout, Hungaroton, Supraphon and Opus Records, for his company Studer-Revox (Hong Kong) to be later renamed Pacific Music. Heymann was asked to join the board of the then amateur Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in 1973, and helped this orchestra become a full-time professional orchestra in 1974. At this time, he also met his future wife, Japanese violinist Takako Nishizaki, who came to play as soloist with the Hong Kong Philharmonic. Heymann's desire to help his wife's career led him to start making her recordings including that of the Chinese Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto with the Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra. Since 1978, it sold several hundred thousand copies legitimately and millions in China. After this unexpected success, Heymann created a label called HK to record other works with the Hong Kong Philharmonic and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. At the same time, he began to import and license music from pop labels such as RCA, Arista, Virgin Records, Chrysalis Records and others. While Heymann was successful selling records of Asian music, he wanted to record rare works, and decided to create the Marco Polo label to do this. After initially recording in Hong Kong and Singapore, Heymann switched to eastern European countries, profiting from his connections with the Hungaroton and Opus labels, located in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which he distributed. In 1987, Heymann founded the Naxos label, with the goal of selling budget-priced classical CDs. His goal was to sell CDs at the same price as LPs, or roughly one-third of the price of CDs at the time. At first, he was acquiring digital recordings from a German company. Then, Naxos began developing its catalog with young or unknown artists and orchestras. Heymann assumed the Naxos catalog would not cover more than fifty releases, thinking that the major labels would begin competing in the same sector, but given the success of the label, the company went on to become a full-fledged classical label covering a wide range of music. Over the years, Heymann led the label to not only record the standard classical repertoire, but also to focus on works that were not often recorded, or not at all. The company is \\"still filling gaps in the repertoire.\\" Heymann was one of the early proponents of digital music, and led Naxos to put its entire catalog on-line for streaming in 1996 via hnh.com that became naxos.com. In 2002, he launched the Naxos Music Library, essentially used by educational institutions and libraries. In 2007, Heymann stated that \\"the label was positioned to survive and prosper without selling CDs,\\" and that \\"revenue from other sources is now big enough to let us not only survive but lead a healthy, profitable existence.\\" He also created distribution companies in most major music markets to distribute Naxos recordings, and the group of companies is now a major distributor of classical recordings and classical music DVDs around the world, including those of Warner Classics and Sony. Heymann claimed, in a 2007 interview with Stereophile Magazine, that he was only just making a \\"decent return\\" from the more than $80 million he invested in the company, \\"thanks to the advent of digital platforms.\\" He sees the future of the classical music market as a mix of CDs, downloads and streaming: \\"Whether physical product will be a half of today or a third of today, nobody knows. There will also be downloads, and all kinds of subscription things. Our streaming classical-music library right now is by far the most successful in our field, and the most profitable for us and for the labels. But there may be others that mix paid and unpaid [streaming].\\" Heymann's strategy is to be \\"the last man standing in terms of distributing classical music in physical form.\\" In 2007, Heymann successfully sued music critic Norman Lebrecht for defamation, for a book entitled Maestros, Masterpieces and Madness: The Secret Life and Shameful Death of the Classical Record Industry, published by Penguin, which led to the UK publisher pulping all copies of the book. Heymann is also the co-founder of Artaria Editions, a music-publishing house with a specialist interest in rare eighteenth-century repertoire. Heymann lives in Hong Kong with his wife Takako Nishizaki and their son Henryk.
