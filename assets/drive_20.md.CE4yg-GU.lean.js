He was born at Maranumbela, his father's station, Snowy River, in the Monaro District of New South Wales. Having served three years as an articled clerk to a solicitor in Melbourne, he relinquished the law and joined his father in squatting pursuits in Queensland in 1861.

A particularly important instance arises in toxicology, where the model for the effect of a drug may be that there is zero effect for a dose below a critical or threshold value, while an effect of some significance exists above that value.Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. Certain types of regression model may include threshold effects.  Collective behavior  Threshold models are often used to model the behavior of groups, ranging from social insects to animal herds to human society. Classic threshold models were introduced by SakodaJournal of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Societies and Social Simulation 20(3) 15, 2017. http://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3511, in his 1949 dissertation and the Journal of Mathematical Sociology (JMS vol 1 #1, 1971)Sakoda, J. M. The Checkerboard Model of Social Interaction. Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1(1):119‚Äì132, 1971. https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989791. They were subsequently developed by Schelling, Axelrod, and Granovetter to model collective behavior. Schelling used a special case of Sakoda's model to describe the dynamics of segregation motivated by individual interactions in America (JMS vol 1 #2, 1971)Schelling, T. C. Dynamic models of segregation. Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1(2):143‚Äì186, 1971a. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794. by constructing two simulation models. Schelling demonstrated that ‚Äúthere is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results,‚Äù and that the dynamics of movement influenced patterns of segregation. In doing so Schelling highlighted the significance of ‚Äúa general theory of ‚Äòtipping‚Äô‚Äù. Mark Granovetter, following Schelling, proposed the threshold model (Granovetter & Soong, 1983, 1986, 1988), which assumes that individuals‚Äô behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaging in that behavior (both Schelling and Granovetter classify their term of ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù as behavioral threshold.). He used the threshold model to explain the riot, residential segregation, and the spiral of silence. In the spirit of Granovetter‚Äôs threshold model, the ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù is ‚Äúthe number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so‚Äù. It is necessary to emphasize the determinants of threshold. Different individuals have different thresholds. Individuals' thresholds may be influenced by many factors: social economic status, education, age, personality, etc. Further, Granovetter relates ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù with utility one gets from participating in collective behavior or not, using the utility function, each individual will calculate his or her cost and benefit from undertaking an action. And situation may change the cost and benefit of the behavior, so threshold is situation- specific. The distribution of the thresholds determines the outcome of the aggregate behavior (for example, public opinion). Segmented regression analysis The models used in segmented regression analysis are threshold models. Fractals Certain deterministic recursive multivariate models which include threshold effects have been shown to produce fractal effects.Tong, H. (1990) Non-linear Time Series: A Dynamical System Approach, OUP. Time series analysis Several classes of nonlinear autoregressive models formulated for time series applications have been threshold models. Toxicology A threshold model used in toxicology posits that anything above a certain dose of a toxin is dangerous, and anything below it safe. This model is usually applied to non-carcinogenic health hazards. Edward J. Calabrese and Linda A. Baldwin wrote: :The threshold dose-response model is widely viewed as the most dominant model in toxicology. An alternative type of model in toxicology is the linear no-threshold model (LNT), while hormesis correspond to the existence of opposite effects at low vs. high dose, which usually gives a U- or inverted U-shaped dose response curve.  Liability threshold model  The liability-threshold model is a threshold model of categorical (usually binary) outcomes in which a large number of variables are summed to yield an overall 'liability' score; the observed outcome is determined by whether the latent score is smaller or larger than the threshold. The liability-threshold model is frequently employed in medicine and genetics to model risk factors contributing to disease. In a genetic context, the variables are all the genes and different environmental conditions, which protect against or increase the risk of a disease, and the threshold z is the biological limit past which disease develops. The threshold can be estimated from population prevalence of the disease (which is usually low). Because the threshold is defined relative to the population & environment, the liability score is generally considered as a N(0, 1) normally distributed random variable. Early genetics models were developed to deal with very rare genetic diseases by treating them as Mendelian diseases caused by 1 or 2 genes: the presence or absence of the gene corresponds to the presence or absence of the disease, and the occurrence of the disease will follow predictable patterns within families. Continuous traits like height or intelligence could be modeled as normal distributions, influenced by a large number of genes, and the heritability and effects of selection easily analyzed. Some diseases, like alcoholism, epilepsy, or schizophrenia, cannot be Mendelian diseases because they are common; do not appear in Mendelian ratios; respond slowly to selection against them; often occur in families with no prior history of that disease; however, relatives and adoptees of someone with that disease are far more likely (but not certain) to develop it, indicating a strong genetic component. The liability threshold model was developed to deal with these non-Mendelian binary cases; the model proposes that there is a continuous normally-distributed trait expressing risk polygenically influenced by many genes, which all individuals above a certain value develop the disease and all below it do not. The first threshold models in genetics were introduced by Sewall Wright, examining the propensity of guinea pig strains to have an extra hind toe, a phenomenon which could not be explained as a dominant or recessive gene, or continuous \\"blinding inheritance\\". The modern liability-threshold model was introduced into human research by geneticist Douglas Scott Falconer in his textbookch18, \\"Threshold characters\\", Introduction to Quantitative Genetics, Falconer 1960 and two papers.\\"The inheritance of liability to certain diseases, estimated from the incidence among relatives\\" , Falconer 1965\\"The inheritance of liability to diseases with variable age of onset, with particular reference to diabetes mellitus\\" , Falconer 1967 Falconer had been asked about the topic of modeling 'threshold characters' by Cyril Clarke who had diabetes.\\"D.

He was a M√©tis Cree artist known for his politically charged abstract paintings. Life and work Boyer grew up in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and earned a BEd from the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan in 1971.Jacoby-Smith, Jennifer. \\"The Painterly Life of Bob Boyer.\\" University of Saskatchewan: Green and White. (retrieved 21 Nov 2009) He joined the Saskatchewan arts community in 1973 and worked on community programming at the Norman MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina until the mid-1970s. He was then a professor of Indian Fine Arts at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College (\\"SIFC\\") (now First Nations University of Canada), a federated college of the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus, later the University of Regina, until 1997.\\"Bob Boyer.\\" Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan. (retrieved 21 Nov 2009) During his time at the SIFC, Boyer acted as the Head of the Department of Indian Fine Arts. Boyer's early paintings use material such as acrylics, paper, and canvas. The earliest paintings are realistic, but he soon embarked on an effort to incorporate an abstract style in his work. One of the earliest results of this is \\"Horses Can Fly, Too,\\" a representation of a horse-figure streaking through the sky. Boyer is well known for his large-scale geometric paintings on felt blankets that he produced primarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This began after a trip to China and Japan.Newlands, 56 He said, \\"There were paintings on silk or cloth and gradually this whole thing about art not having to be made on stretched canvas really began to get through to me.\\" Boyer used oil paints applied thickly, using rough brush strokes in many of these works. The geometric designs on the blanket paintings come from the tradition motifs of Siouan and Cree groups in Western Canada. Boyer tended to use traditional colour combinations in early blanket paintings, but some later examples are painted in pastels. At first Boyer painted about the wrong Europeans have done to Aboriginal peoples, but he later switched to things about the Aboriginal culture and the meaning of life. Boyer called all of this 'Blanket Statements'. Many of the pieces from the Boyer's 'Blanket Period' are in the permanent collections of major galleries such the National Gallery of Canada and the Norman MacKenzie Gallery. Paintings bear unique and enigmatic titles that came to Boyer at poignant moments such as after sweat lodge ceremonies. Boyer's influences from aboriginal art traditions are obvious, but he was also influenced by local Saskatchewan artists such as Ted Godwin and Art McKay of the Regina Five, and to a lesser extent Joe Fafard. As a university professor and elder, Boyer mentored many young aboriginal and non-aboriginal artists. Boyer died in 2004 while powwow dancing.  Murals in the Royal Saskatchewan Museum  Boyer painted large murals in the First Nations Gallery of the Royal Saskatchewan Museum. A large mural forms part of the display of the winter camp in the \\"Seasonal Round\\" section of the Gallery.  The Carousel of Life Mural  One of Boyer's larger works is the Carousel of Life mural, painted on the exterior west wall of the building located at 2941-13th Avenue in the Cathedral district of Regina, which is adjacent to the 13th Avenue Canada Safeway grocery store. It depicts four horses framed by one of Boyer's blankets. It was commissioned by the Cathedral Area Community Association in 1996, as part of the annual arts festival. On August 2, 2011, the City of Regina announced that Safeway had applied for zoning changes to allow it to expand its 13th Avenue store.Proposed Rezoning and Discretionary Use (11-Z-10/11-DU-16) The Information Sheet for the proposed re-zoning application states that \\"... most of the flanking on the existing site will be lost to the grocery store expansion...\\"City of Regina Information Sheet. The Information Sheet does not state if the Boyer mural will be preserved in some fashion, or if Canada Safeway will destroy the mural as part of the expansion of its store.

The Act had two parts: first, it reformed the calendar of England and the British Dominions so that the new legal year began on 1 January rather than 25 March (Lady Day); and, second, Great Britain and its Dominions adopted (in effect) the Gregorian calendar, as already used in most of western Europe. Chesterfield introduced the Bill into Parliament on 25 February 1750/1. It was passed by the Commons on 13 May and received royal assent on 27 May 1751. Reasons for change The Parliament held that the Julian calendar then in use, and the start of the year on 25 March, were Great Britain and the British Colonies In England and Wales, the legal year 1751 was a short year of 282 days, running from 25 March to 31 December. 1752 began on 1 January. To align the calendar in use in England to that on the continent, the Gregorian calendar was adopted, and the calendar was advanced by 11 days: Wednesday 2 September 1752 was followed by Thursday 14 September 1752. The year 1752 was a leap year so that it consisted of 355 days (366 days less 11 omitted). As well as adopting the Gregorian rule for leap years, Pope Gregory's rules for the date of Easter were also adopted. However, with religious strife still on their minds, the British could not bring themselves to adopt the Catholic system explicitly: the Annexe to the Act established a computation for the date of Easter that achieved the same result as Gregory's rules, without actually referring to him.24 Geo. II Ch. 23, ¬ß 3. The algorithm, set out in the Book of Common Prayer as required by the Act, includes calculation of the Golden Number and the Sunday Letter, which (in the Easter section of the Book) were presumed to be already known. The Annexe to the Act includes the definition: \\"Easter-day (on which the rest depend) is always the first Sunday after the Full Moon, which happens upon, or next after the Twenty-first Day of March. And if the Full Moon happens upon a Sunday, Easter-day is the Sunday after.\\" The Annexe subsequently uses the terms \\"Paschal Full Moon\\" and \\"Ecclesiastical Full Moon\\", making it clear that they only approximate to the real Full Moon.24 Geo. II Ch. 23, Annexe. =Scotland= Scotland had already partly made the change: its calendar year had begun on 1 January since 1600. The remainder of the act applied equally to Scotland, a part of the Kingdom of Great Britain since the Acts of Union 1707. =Ireland= At the time, the Kingdom of Ireland was a semi-autonomous kingdom in a personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain. So that the calendar in Ireland would remain harmonised with that of Great Britain, the Parliament of Ireland passed similarly worded legislation as the \\"Calendar (New Style) Act, 1750\\". = United States = The Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 applied to Britain's American colonies and some British law, including the 1750 Act, is still applicable in some states. When American independence was declared in 1776, it was not practical for these former colonies to create an entirely new body of American law to replace British law. The practical solution adopted was to continue to apply British law as it stood in 1776 but subject to the proviso that it could be overridden by any subsequent provision of American law. Florida provides a suitable example: the Territory was ceded by Spain to the United States in 1819. The new State of Florida repealed Spanish law and enacted a provision which said (and continues to say): James Bryan Whitfield, a former Florida Supreme Court judge, together with others, produced in 1941 a comprehensive list of the relevant measures. This built on earlier work by Missouri. The list includes the key part of the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. Some states adopted as their common law the laws of England in 1607, predating the 1750 Act. cite web  url= https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3528&context;=mlr  title =Benson Reception of the Common Law in Missouri There is no federal calendar law. = Other former British colonies = The Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 applies directly or indirectly in other former British colonies. The Act remains directly in force in Canada as part of Canadian law.Canadian encyclopedia. Canadian calendar. Early Australian colonial legislation applied British law.Section 24 Australian Courts Act 1928 provided that all laws and statutes in force in the realm of England as at 25 July 1828 were to be applied in the administration of justice in New South Wales. Subsequently, various reviews have considered the relevance of old British statutes. Australian States eventually repealed British statutes but re-enacted those which remained relevant, such as the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. For example, New South Wales passed the Imperial Acts Application Act 1969 No 30. Section 5 and Schedule 1 repeals various British statutes including the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. At the same time section 16 continues the operation of the British Calendar Act by restating key parts and by referring to that Act for the details.Imperial Acts Application Act 1969. Law of Australia. Other Australian States passed similar measures. New Zealand also passed early legislation at various times applying British law.Section 1 English Laws Act 1858 and English Laws Act 1908. New Zealand undertook a comprehensive review in the 1980s to clarify which statutes still applied, drawing on Australian research, and produced the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988.Imperial Laws Application Act 1988. This did not repeal old British statutes and re-enact relevant measures. Instead section 1(1) says that British statutes listed in Schedule 1 \\"are hereby declared to be part of the laws of New Zealand\\". This includes the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. Section 4 said that any other British statutes were not part of New Zealand law and so were, in effect, repealed.Article on Imperial Laws. Reaction and effect =The calendar riot= An Election Entertainment (c. 1755), a painting by William Hogarth, which is the main source for \\"Give us our Eleven Days\\". Some history books say that some people rioted after the calendar change, asking that their \\"eleven days\\" be returned. However this is very likely a myth, based on only two primary sources: The World, a satirical journal of Lord Chesterfield; and a painting by William Hogarth.; Chesterfield was behind the Act. He wrote to his son, \\"Every numerous assembly is a mob, let the individuals who compose it be what they will. Mere sense is never to be talked to a mob; their passions, their sentiments, their senses and their seeming interests alone are to be applied to. Understanding have they collectively none.\\" Here, he was boasting of his skill in having the Bill passed through the Lords; the 'mob' in question was his fellow peers. When the son of the Earl of Macclesfield (who had been influential in passing the Act) stood for Parliament in Oxfordshire as a Whig in 1754, dissatisfaction with the calendar reform was one of a number of issues raised by his Tory opponents. In 1755, William Hogarth produced a painting (and an engraved print from the painting) loosely based on these elections, entitled An Election Entertainment, which shows a placard carrying the slogan \\"Give us our Eleven Days\\" (on floor at lower right). An example of the resulting incorrect history is by Ronald Paulson, author of Hogarth, His Life, Art and Times, who wrote that \\"the Oxfordshire people ‚Ä¶ are specifically rioting, as historically the London crowd did, to preserve the 'Eleven Days' the government stole from them in September 1752 by changing the calendar\\". Thus the \\"calendar riot\\" fiction was born. The election campaign depicted concluded in 1754, after a very lengthy contest between Court Whigs and Jacobite Tories. Every issue between the two factions was brought up, including the question of calendar reform. The Tories attacked the Whigs for every deviation, including their alleged favouritism towards foreign Jews and the \\"Popish\\" calendar. Hogarth's placard, part of a satire on the character of the debate, was not an observation of actual crowd behaviour. =Legitimate concerns= There were, however, legitimate concerns lest tax and other payments arise any earlier under the new calendar than they would otherwise have done. Consequently, Provision 6 (Times of Payment of Rents, Annuities) of the Act stipulated that monthly or yearly payments would not become due until the dates that they originally would have done had the Julian calendar continued or, in the words of the Act, \\"[Times of Payment of Rents, Annuities] at and upon the same respective natural days and times as the same should and ought to have been payable or made or would have happened in case this Act had not been made\\". This provision applied to defer payment of Window Tax which was a permanent tax. It did not apply to Land Tax which was re-enacted each year (see the next section below). The Land Tax Act for the year from 25 March 1752 became law after the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 and therefore over-rode the provision governing the time of payment. =Religious dissent= In Appalachia, some Scots-Irish settlers resisted the changeover mandated by the Calendar Act by continuing to celebrate Christmas on 6 January (N.S.), referring to the day as Old Christmas.  Why the United Kingdom income tax year begins on 6 April Several theories have been proposed for the odd beginning of the British tax year on 6 April. The one most commonly found on British tax websites stems from a book published in 1921 by Alexander Philip. In a brief passage Philip says that eleven days were added to the old tax year which began on 25 March 1752. Then from 1753 until 1799 the tax year began on 5 April. He goes on to say that in 1800 a further day was added so that thereafter the tax year began on 6 April. The extra day was added, he says, because 1800 had 366 days in the Julian calendar but only 365 in the Gregorian calendar. He does not say why it was necessary to add another day. Further, he continues, the tax year was not changed when a thirteenth Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the tax year in the United Kingdom still begins on 6 April.HM Revenue & Customs. The passage is: Philip does not give any reason for his view. He does not cite any legislation or other authority. It is also worth noting that the \\"financial year\\" is not the same as the income tax year. The financial year is statutorily defined as the year which ends on 31 March. See Schedule 1 Interpretation Act 1978,Interpretation Act 1978. which repeats an earlier similar definition in section 22 Interpretation Act 1889.Interpretation Act 1889. This is the year for government accounting and for corporation tax. Jane Frecknall-Hughes, Professor of Accounting and Taxation at the University of Nottingham, takes the same view as Philip in a number of newspaper articles she has written. The Professor, like Philip, gives no reasons for her view. A good many websites for accountants have repeated versions of these articles. Other commentators. believe the Philip view is wrong and the correct explanation is that the old tax year used to begin on 26 March, the day after the quarter day. Hence, to deal with the omission of eleven days in September 1752, eleven days were eventually added to the start of the tax year and that led to a tax year beginning on 6 April. There was no need to add a further day in 1800. The taxes charged by the year (Land Tax and Window Tax) applied to a year \\"from\\" 25 March and, under a legal rule of interpretation dating back at least to Sir Edward Coke's landmark work of 1628, the Institutes of the Lawes of England, Sometimes called \\"Coke on Littleton\\" because it contains Sir Thomas Littleton's 1481 treatise on property law with a commentary by Coke. Volume 1 at 46b. this meant the tax year began a day later on 26 March. Coke's book was written as a commentary on the 1481 treatise on property law by Sir Thomas Littleton. Hence the specialist use of \\"from\\" may originate back in the mists of time. The key passage in the Institutes is short: Coke's Institutes were an important source of education for lawyers and editions were published up to the nineteenth century. This is why tax acts in the eighteenth century used \\"from\\" 25 March in an exclusive sense to mean a period beginning on the following day. Numerous court cases have arisen because the technical meaning of from a date in acts and documents has been misunderstood.See, for example, Zoan v Rouamba [2000 All ER 620.]. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which drafts legislation today, has published online drafting guidance which says the \\"from a date\\" formulation is ambiguous and should not be used. See heading 8. Perhaps the most important contemporary authority for the alternative view is in An Exposition of the Land Tax by Mark A Bourdin of the Inland Revenue which was published in 1854. In a footnote on page 34 he says: Bourdin does not use from in the strict sense required by Coke but it is clear that he believes the Land Tax year begins on 26 March and ends on the following 25 March. Some commentators suggest eleven days were added to the tax year which began in March 1752 to avoid the loss of tax in the short year caused by the omission of eleven days in September 1752. Professor Frecknall- Hughes takes this view as did, remarkably, the Inland Revenue in a note issued on the 200th anniversary of income tax in 1999.This note is no longer live online. A copy is in Appendix 25 of Why the Tax Year Begins on Sixth April. O'Brien, Alan (2019). Lulu.com. In fact the British tax authorities did not add eleven days to the end of the tax year which began on 26 March 1752. The eighteenth century Treasury did not need to add eleven days because the taxes charged by the year (Land Tax and Window Tax) captured artificial, deemed income, and not actual income. For Land Tax, the more important of the two, this was fixed amounts linked to the market rental value of property in 1692 when the tax was introduced. For Window Tax it was so much per window. You paid the same regardless of the year length. Window Tax was a permanent tax and its year did not change till 1758 when the tax was recast and the tax year moved by eleven days to run \\"from\\" 5 April.31 Geo II c.22. Window Tax 1758 at page 258. That meant a year which began on 6 April because of Sir Edward Coke's 1628 interpretation rule. The Land Tax year did not change and continued to run from 25 March. Land Tax was re-enacted each year throughout the eighteenth century until 1798 when it was made permanent. Moreover, the entire code, running to 80 pages, was re-enacted each year until 1798. Hence there was ample opportunity to revise the date on which the Land Tax year began but no change was made. Because of the transitory value of the annual Act, later editions of the statutes which are available online, omitted the Land Tax Acts. However, several are available online including the last annual Land Tax Act for the year for the year from 25 March 1798. This is available in two versions: the original 38 Geo III c.5. > Original Land Tax Act 1797. Page 461. and the version which reflects some later amendments.38 Geo III c.5. Land Tax Act 1798 page 461. The National Archives at Kew holds printed statute series which include copies of all the Land Tax Acts. The 1798 Act uses the standard \\"from\\" formula and says in section 2: The following year William Pitt made Land Tax permanent with the Land Tax Perpetuation Act 1798. Section 3, for example, refers to \\"an assessment made in the year ending on the twenty fifth day of March 1799\\", which confirms the Land Tax year begins on 26 March.Land Tax Perpetuation Act 1798, 38 Geo III c.60 at page 725. The Land Tax year remained essentially unchanged until the tax was abolished in 1963. When William Pitt introduced the first income tax in 1799 he followed the Window Tax precedent and adopted a year which ran \\"from\\" 5 April.39 Geo III c.13. Income Tax Act 1799. See section 72 on page 86. That meant, once again, a year which began on 6 April and this has remained the start of the year ever since. Examination of tax acts confirms that there was no change in 1800. For example, Addington's Income Tax Act 1803 continued to apply \\"from\\" 5 April‚Äîin this case from 5 April 1803.43 Geo III c.122. Addingtons' Income Tax Act 1803 at page 1229. Again, this meant a year beginning on 6 April 1803. Since taxing statutes before and after 1800 used the from 5 April formula to define the year it is clear that a day was not added in 1800. Compare the Window Tax Act 1758 and Addington's Income Tax Act 1803. The legal analysis is buttressed by accounting practice from time immemorial. A quarter day, such as Lady Day on 25 March, marked the end of an accounting period and not the beginning. This view is taken by leading authorities including The Exchequer Year,Richardson, H G, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society Vol 8 (1925) pp 171-190. Cambridge University Press p. 171, first line: \\"From the earliest times and for many centuries the year of account in the Exchequer ended at Michaelmas\\".

See Table III in Chapter 2 which lists the Exchequer Years from Henry I to William IV. Every year ends on the quarter day, 29 September. The Pipe Roll SocietyPipe Roll Society. Under the heading \\"How Pipe Rolls were compiled\\" the section begins: \\"Each roll nominally covered the events of a year ending at Michaelmas (29 September), rather than the calendar year or the regnal year, which was used in the rolls produced by other government departments\\" and Dr Robert Poole in two works. In the 1995 work Calendar Reform Dr Poole cites Treasury Board Papers at the National Archives under reference T30 12 and explains that the accounts carried on being drawn up to the same four days in the real world but the dates had moved on by eleven days. He says: These were the old quarter days of 25 December, 25 March, 24 June and 29 September plus eleven days. Dr Poole's analysis is confirmed by a minute of the Board of Customs on 19 September 1752, shortly after the omission of the eleven days 3 to 13 September 1752 and not long before the first quarter day affected by the omission‚ÄîMichaelmas 29 September 1752. The minute says: It was not until 1860 that income tax legislation consistently adopted a formulation of the kind recommended today by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to identify the income tax year. For 1860-61 the tax was applied \\"for a year commencing on 6 April 1860\\".23 Vict c.14. Income Tax Act 1860 at page 86. Section 48(3) of the Taxes Management Act 1880 provided a definition of the income tax year for the first time: Curiously the draftsman here incorrectly uses \\"from\\" 6 April but still makes the year clear. Section 28 Finance Act 1919 provided a new shorthand way to refer to the tax year: Finally, following a review aimed at simplifying tax legislation, a new definition appeared in section 4 Income Tax Act 2007: See also *Old Style and New Style dates Notes References    Primary sources  ‚Äî The original 1750/51 Act. * cols 979‚Äì992.

Activity  The headline of the New York Times from 22 July 1905 = Planning = The Armenian Revolutionary Federation planned the assassination attempt on the sultan to enact vengeance. Dashnak members, led by ARF founder Christapor Mikaelian, secretly started producing explosives and planning the operation in Sofia, Bulgaria. During planning, the explosives were made at the improvised bomb- making factory in the village of Sablyar, near the Bulgarian town of Kyustendil. Christapor Mikaelian, alongside his friend Vramshabouh Kendirian, died in an accidental explosion. Despite losing the instigators of the operation, it continued as planned. Sultan Abdul Hamid Han would pray every Friday at the Yildiz mosque and would usually leave around the same time each time, creating a pattern in his movement. Taking advantage of this, the ARF planned to hide timed explosives in a carriage parked outside the mosque which were to explode at the time that Sultan Abdul Hamid Han would leave the mosque. It was decided that Zareh, a fedayee and participant in the Ottoman Bank takeover, would drive the carriage. = Attempt = On 21 July 1905, Zareh drove the carriage in front of the mosque.

It was established by the leadership of the Theosophical Society at Adyar, Chennai, in order to prepare the world for the arrival of a messianic entity, the so-called World Teacher or Maitreya. The OSE acquired members worldwide as it expanded in many countries; a third of its diverse membership was unaffiliated with the Theosophical Society. The precursor of the OSE was the (, also at Benares) and the successor was the (, based at Ommen, the Netherlands). The precursor organisation was formed after leading Theosophists discovered a likely candidate for the new messiah in the thenadolescent Jiddu Krishnamurti (18951986), a South Indian Brahmin who was installed as Head of the Order. Almost two decades later Krishnamurti rejected the messianic role, repudiated the Order's mission, and in 1929 disbanded the OSE's successor. The founding and activities of these organisations, as well as the largely unexpected dissolution of the OSE's successor, attracted widespread media attention and public interest. They also led to crises in the Theosophical Society and to schisms in Theosophy. Background One of the central tenets of late 19th-century Theosophy as promoted by the Theosophical Society was the complex doctrine of intelligent evolution of all existence. This was said to be occurring on a Cosmic scale, incorporating both physical and non-physical aspects of the known and unknown Universe, and affecting all of its constituent parts regardless of apparent size or importance. The theory was originally promulgated in the Secret Doctrine (published 1888), a book by Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of contemporary Theosophy and the Theosophical Society. According to this view, Humankind's evolution on Earth (and beyond) is part of the Cosmic evolution. It is reputedly overseen by a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, the so-called Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, whose upper echelons consist of advanced spiritual beings. Blavatsky portrayed the Theosophical Society as one of the Hierarchy's many attempts (or \\"impulses\\") throughout the millennia, to guide Humanityin concert with the intelligent evolutionary schemeto its ultimate, immutable objective: the attainment of perfection and the conscious participation in the evolutionary process. Blavatsky stated that these attempts require an Earth-based infrastructure (such as the Theosophical Society), to pave the way for the Hierarchy's physically appearing emissaries, \\"the torch-bearer of Truth\\". The mission of these reputedly regularly appearing emissaries is to practically translate, in a way and language understood by contemporary humanity, the knowledge required to propel it to a higher evolutionary stage. History =Early history= Blavatsky also wrote about the possible impact of Theosophy and the Theosophical Society in her book The Key to Theosophy (published 1889): Based on this and other Blavatsky writings, Theosophists expected the future advent of the aforementioned \\"next impulse\\"; additional information was the purview of the Society's Esoteric Section, which Blavatsky had founded and originally led. After Blavatsky's death in 1891, influential Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater expanded on her writings about the Spiritual Hierarchy and the Masters. He formulated a Christology in which he identified Christ with the Theosophical representation of the Buddhist concept of Maitreya. Leadbeater believed that Maitreya-as-Christ had manifested on Earth in several occasions, using in each case a specially prepared person as a \\"vehicle\\". The incarnated Maitreya assumed the role of World Teacher of Humankind, dispensing knowledge regarding underlying truths of Existence. Annie Besant, another well-known and influential Theosophist (and eventual close associate of Leadbeater's), had also developed an interest on the advent of the next emissary from the Spiritual Hierarchy. During the decades of the 1890s and 1900s, along with Leadbeater and others, she became progressively convinced that this advent would happen sooner than Blavatsky's proposed timetable. They came to believe it would involve the imminent reappearance of Maitreya as World Teacher, a monumental event in the Theosophical worldview. However, not all Theosophical Society members accepted Leadbeater's and Besant's ideas on the matter; the dissidents charged them with straying from Theosophical orthodoxy and, along with other concepts developed by the two, their elaborations on the Theosophical Maitreya were derisively labelled Neo-Theosophy by their opponents. Besant became President of the Theosophical Society in 1907, and added considerable weight to the belief of Maitreya's imminent manifestation; this eventually became a commonly held expectation among Theosophists. Besant had started commenting on the possibly imminent arrival of the next emissary as early as 1896; by 1909 the proclaimed \\"coming Teacher\\" was a main topic of her lectures and writings. =\\"Discovery\\" of Jiddu Krishnamurti= Sometime between late April and late May1909, at the private beach of the Theosophical Society Headquarters in Adyar, Chennai, Leadbeater encountered Jiddu Krishnamurti, a fourteen-year-old South Indian Brahmin. At the time Jiddu Narayaniah, Krishnamurti's father and longtime Theosophist, was employed by the Society; the family, in relatively poor condition, lived next to the compound. Leadbeater, a controversial figure whose knowledge on occult matters was highly respected by the Society's leadership, came to believe young Krishnamurti was a suitable candidate for the vehicle of the World Teacherdespite the boy's reputedly dull personality and lackluster intellect. Leadbeater soon placed Krishnamurti, and at the latter's insistence his inseparable younger brother Jiddu Nityananda (\\"Nitya\\"), under his and the Society's wing; in late1909 Besant, as President of the Society and head of its Esoteric Section, admitted the Jiddu brothers into both. In March1910 she became their legal guardian. Following the \\"discovery\\", Leadbeater began occult examinations of Krishnamurti, to whom he had assigned the pseudonym the name of a star in the Pleiades star cluster, and of characters from Greek mythology. Leadbeater's belief regarding the boy's suitability was strengthened by his clairvoyance-aided investigations of Krishnamurti's reputed past and future lives. Results of these investigations were recorded, and eventually published in Theosophical magazines starting April1910, and in a book in 1913. They were widely read and discussed within the Society, as according to Leadbeater, contemporary Theosophists were involved in various \\"lives of Alcyone\\". Such reputed involvement became a matter of status and prestige among Theosophists; it also contributed to factionalism within the Society. In the meantime, Krishnamurti was put on a comprehensive multiyear regimen of physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual training in preparation for his probable future role. =Order of the Rising Sun= In late1910 the Theosophical Society published the first work \\"by Alcyone\\", a booklet entitled At the Feet of the Master. The book became very popular among Theosophists, and around the same time (officially, in January1911), the was founded at Benares (Varanasi) by George Arundale, a prominent Theosophist. Arundale, Principal of the Central Hindu College (CHC), had been impressed by Alcyone's writings, and formed the Order around a CHC-based study group of disciples headed by Krishnamurti. The new entity was generally focused on the expected World Teacher, yet the recently discovered Krishnamurti-Alcyone wassomewhat obliquelyat the center of its attention. Meanwhile, the activities and proclamations of Leadbeater, Besant, and other senior Theosophists regarding Krishnamurti and the expected Teacher became entangled in prior disputes within and without the Theosophical Society, and also the subjects of new controversies. The evolving controversies, as well as objections by Hindu members of the CHC faculty, prompted Besant to officially disband the organisation in May1911; however, a replacement had already been formed. Annie Besant and Jiddu Krishnamurti (center), flanked by Jiddu Nityananda (left), and George Arundale (right). London, =Order of the Star in the East= In April1911 Besant founded the (OSE), based again at Benares, which replaced the Order of the Rising Sun. It was named after the Star of Bethlehem, signifying the proclaimed approach of the new manifestation of Christ-Maitreya. The top positions of the organisation were filled: \\"Mrs Besant and Leadbeater were made Protectors of the new Order of which Krishna was the Head, Arundale Private Secretary to the Head, and Wodehouse Organizing Secretary\\". News regarding Krishnamurti, the Order, and its mission received widespread publicity and worldwide press coverage; the publicity may have been at least partly driven by aspects of the era's prevailing ' mood. Objective and principles membership certificate (Netherlands Section, 1917). Black and white copy, reduced. The goal of the OSE was to educate and prepare the world for the arrival of the World Teacher and to remove any material obstacles and difficulties from his path. By late1913, the Order had worldwide; most of them were also members of the Theosophical Society. However, membership was open to anyone, the only precondition being acceptance of the \\"Declaration of Principles\\", which stated the following: New members received an OSE certificate , and could thereafter display the organisation's emblem, a five- pointed star. Activities Following its establishment the OSE began its mission in earnest. Lecture tours, meetings and other activities were undertaken by prominent members of the Order. Articles and pamphlets about the OSE and its mission, published regularly by Theosophical organisations, were joined by an official bulletin, The Herald of the Star, originally based at Adyar, which started publication in January1912. As Krishnamurti came of age, he embarked on an intensified schedule of lectures and discussions in several countries, and acquired a large following among the membership of the Theosophical Society. National Sections of the Order were eventually formed in as many as forty countries. On during a ceremony officiated by Krishnamurti at the close of the annual Theosophical Convention (held that year at Benares), those present were reported to be suddenly overwhelmed by a strange feeling of \\"tremendous power\\", which seemed to be flowing through Krishnamurti. In Leadbeater's description, \\"it reminded one irresistibly of the rushing, mighty wind, and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost. The tension was enormous, and every one in the room was most powerfully affected.\\" The next day, at a meeting of the Esoteric Section, Besant for the first time announced that it was now obvious Krishnamurti was indeed the chosen vehicle. Thereafter, 28 December became a \\"sacred day\\" for the Order. In 1912, Krishnamurti's father sued Besant in order to annul her guardianship of his son, which he had previously granted. Among the reasons stated in Narayaniah's deposition was his objection to the deification of Krishnamurti, said to have been caused by Besant's \\"announcement that he was to be the Lord Christ, with the result that a number of respectable persons had prostrated before him.\\" Besant eventually won the case on appeal. Also in 1912, most members of the Theosophical Society's German Section followed its head, Rudolf Steiner, in splitting from the parent Societypartly due to disagreement over Besant's and Leadbeater's proclamations concerning Krishnamurti's messianic status. Controversy regarding the OSE and Krishnamurti again engulfed the Central Hindu College. In 1913, a number of the Order's supporters resigned their positions at the CHC following opposition by the school's administration and trustees, who considered the Order's activities unacademical. In 1920, Krishnamurti's younger brother Nitya replaced Wodehouse as Organising Secretary. The next year, the first international Congress of the Order of the Star in the East was held in Paris, France, attended by 2,000members out of then about30,000 worldwide. At the Congress it was decided that there would be no special ceremonies or rituals associated with the Order or with the World Teacher. Also in the 1920s, regularly scheduled multiday Star Camps, supported by well-organised facilities, started to be held in the Netherlands, the United States, and India. They were attended by thousands of members, with coverage provided by local and international media. In late1925, close Krishnamurti associate and friend D.Rajagopal was appointed general secretary following Nitya's unexpected death. While the Order's activities continued without visible disruption, Nitya's death was a privately devastating, watershed event for Krishnamurti. Financing the venture and subsequent expansion did not appear to present a problem. Properties in several countries were acquired via specially-formed trusts or by affiliates, for a variety of purposes. In collaboration with the Theosophical Society, the OSE had been producing a number of publications and propaganda material ; in 1926, it organised its own publishing arm: the Star Publishing Trust, based at Eerde, Ommen, the Netherlands. Along with an official international bulletin published in Ommen (the International Star Bulletin), national bulletins eventually appeared in twenty-one countries, and in fourteen different languages. Also in 1926 it was reported that the Order's membership had reached about43,000, twothirds of which were members of the Theosophical Society. Claims and expectations By efforts of prominent Theosophists and their affiliated factions to favourably position themselves for the expected were reaching a climax. Extraordinary pronouncements of accelerated spiritual advancement were being made by various parties, privately disputed by others. Ranking members of the Order and the Society had publicly declared themselves to have been chosen as apostles of the new Messiah. The escalating claims of spiritual success, and the internal (and hidden from the public) Theosophical politics, alienated an increasingly disillusioned Krishnamurti. His commitment and enthusiasm had been uneven since the Order's early days, and in private he had occasionally expressed doubts about his presumed mission. He refused to recognise anyone as his disciple or apostle. In the meantime, World Teacher-related spinoff projects proliferated: in August1925 the establishment of a \\"World Religion\\" and a \\"World University\\" were announced by the Theosophical leadership. Both of them were later \\"quietly shelved\\". The annual Star Congress for 1925 opened at Adyar on the \\"sacred day\\" of 28December, following the much anticipated but uneventful Theosophical Convention. At the opening, an event occurred that was reminiscent of the incident that had happened on the same day of 1911. Krishnamurti had been giving a speech about the World Teacher and the significance of his coming, when \\"a dramatic change\\" took place: his voice suddenly altered and he switched to first person, saying \\"I come for those who want sympathy, who want happiness, who are longing to be released, who are longing to find happiness in all things. I come to reform and not to tear down, I come not to destroy but to build.\\" For many of the assembled who noticed, it was a \\"spine- tingling\\" revelation, \\"felt... instantly and independently\\"confirmation, in their view, that the manifestation of the Lord Maitreya through his chosen vehicle had begun. =Order of the Star= The reputed manifestation of the World Teacher prompted a number of celebratory statements and assertions by prominent Theosophists that were not unanimously accepted by Society members. One result was the persistence of controversy regarding the project. Besant and other leaders of the Society largely managed to contain the dissenters and the controversy, but in the process sustained unflattering publicity. However, the so-called World Teacher Project was also receiving serious and neutral coverage in the global media, and according to reports it was followed sympathetically and with interest by non-Theosophists. Jiddu Krishnamurti in the 1920s In related developments following the perceived manifestation, Besant announced in January1927, \\"he World Teacher is here\\", and many Star members expected Krishnamurti's unequivocal public proclamation of his messianic status. Reflecting the new situation, in June1927 the name of the organisation was changed to , and its main organ was retitled ; the organisation relocated at Ommen, with D.Rajagopal serving as Chief Organiser. The renamed organisation had two objectives: Complementing the reorganisation and the proclamations of the World Teacher's manifestation, in 1928 the so- called , headed by Rukmini Devi Arundale (George Arundale's young wife), was put in motion by Theosophical leaders. Krishnamurti again distanced himself from this endeavour, which Indian and international press reports dubbed \\"Mrs. Besant's New Fad\\", and it was to be short-lived. =Dissolution and repudiation= By the late1920s, Krishnamurti's emphasis in public talks and private discussions had changed. He had been gradually discarding or contradicting Theosophical concepts and terminology, disagreeing with leading Theosophists, and talking less about the World Teacher; public interest, and attendance at his speaking engagements, remained high. The shift in emphasis mirrored fundamental changes in Krishnamurti as a person, including his increasing disenchantment with the World Teacher Project. They led Krishnamurti to a thorough re-evaluation of his relationship with the Project, the Theosophical Society, and Theosophy in general. Finally, on , at the Ommen Star Camp, he disbanded the Order in front of Besant and about 3,000members. In his speech dissolving the organisation (also broadcast on Dutch radio), Krishnamurti said: Despite the changes in Krishnamurti's outlook and pronouncements during the preceding years (and more recent rumours of impending dissolution), the ending of the Order and its mission shocked many of its supporters. Prominent Theosophists openly or under various guises turned against Krishnamurtiincluding Leadbeater, who reputedly stated, \\"the Coming has gone wrong\\". However, other Society members supported Krishnamurti's new direction, and opposed the critical views expressed by Theosophical leaders. Soon after the dissolution Krishnamurti severed his ties to Theosophy and the Theosophical Society. He denounced the concepts of saviors, leaders, and spiritual teachers. Vowing to work towards setting humankind \\"absolutely, unconditionally free\\", he repudiated all doctrines and theories of inner, spiritual and psychological evolution such as those implied in the Theosophical tenets described above . Instead, he posited that his goal of complete psychological freedom could be realised only through the understanding of individuals' actual relationships with themselves, society, and nature. Krishnamurti returned to the donors estates, property and funds that had been given to the Order in its various incarnations. He spent the rest of his life promoting his post-Theosophical message around the world as an independent speaker and writer. He became widely known as an original, influential thinker on philosophical, psychological, and religious subjects. Consequences In 1907, the first year for which reliable records were kept, the worldwide membership of the Theosophical Society was estimated at over15,000. During the following two decades membership suffered due to splits and resignations, but by the mid1920s it was rising again; it eventually peaked in 1928 at . The membership of the Order in its various guises kept increasing steadily, yet Krishnamurti's changing message in the period leading to the dissolution may have negatively affected growth. Many members of the Order were also members of the Theosophical Society; consequently, as many as a third of the members of the Society left \\"within a few years\\" of Krishnamurti's disbanding of the Order. In the opinion of a Krishnamurti biographer, the Society, already in decline for other reasons, \\"was in disarray\\" upon the dissolution of the Order. While Theosophical publications and leading members tried to minimise the effect of Krishnamurti's actions and the defunct Order's importance, the \\"truth... was that the Theosophical Society had been had combatively challenged the central tenet of its beliefs\\". The failed project led to considerable analysis and retrospective evaluations by the Society and by well-known Theosophists, at that time and since. It also resulted in governance changes in the Theosophical Society Adyar, a reorientation of its Esoteric Section, re-examination of parts of its doctrine, and reticence to outside questions regarding the OSE and the World Teacher Project. According to both theosophical and non-theosophical observers, Theosophical organisations, especially the Theosophical Society Adyar, by the close of the 20thcentury had yet to recover from Krishnamurti's rejection and the entire World Teacher affair, and entered the 21st still dealing with their effects. Cultural references Events and personalities related to the World Teacher Project and the OSE have been portrayed, or alluded to, in artistic and cultural works. \\"The Word of the Master\\" (), is a 1925 work for voice and piano by Finnish composer Leevi Madetoja Originally published as \\"At the Feet of the Master (Alcyone)\\", its devotional lyrics are based on the eponymous book . The three-minute-long work was republished under the new title in 1929; , it was included in contemporary performances on CD- Audio. \\"Benares, 1910\\", an episode in the 1990s US television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles created by George Lucas, is taking place in Benares around the time of Krishnamurti's discovery and the formation of the OSE. The hour-long episode loosely (and sympathetically) portrays these and related events. The including series explores the childhood and youth of the fictional character Indiana Jones; in this instalment, the protagonist gets to meet the boy Krishnamurti, Besant and Leadbeater. Filmed on location at Benares. The episode originally aired on during primetime, on the ABC television network; it achieved modest Nielsen ratings. It was later re-packaged in a television \\"Movie of the Week\\" titled The Journey of Radiance(2000), which was also released, along with related documentary material, on DVD-Video(2007). Blue Dove, a musical in two acts, is based on Krishnamurti's life between his discovery by Leadbeater and the start of his career as an independent philosopher and speaker following the dissolution of the Order of the Star. The musical, with a running time of two hours and fifteen minutes, premiered in October2004 at Los Angeles' Ivar Theatre and had a three-week stage run; a 40-minute recording of songs was released in 2005. The libretto and plot, by Englishman Peter Wells, employ considerable artistic licence in their portrayals of related persons and events.

He is best known for being the keyboardist/pianist for the Blues Brothers in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers, a role he reprised in the sequel, Blues Brothers 2000. His father was Chicago politician George Dunne. Dunne won the role in The Blues Brothers after their original pianist, Paul Shaffer, could not accept the part due to his contractual obligations with Saturday Night Live, as well as his choice to take part in Gilda Live. Dunne played himself in both of the two Blues Brothers films, with a fictional storyline: Murphy \\"Murph\\" Dunne was an original member of the Blues Brothers until \\"Joliet\\" Jake went to prison in the 1970s. He then started his own band called \\"Murph and the MagicTones\\" along with four other ex-Blues Brothers Band members; Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, Steve \\"The Colonel\\" Cropper, Willie \\"Too Big\\" Hall and Tom \\"Bones\\" Malone. While performing a regular set at the Armada Room in a Chicago area Holiday Inn, Jake and Elwood Blues again approached the band to reform the Blues Brothers band. After a brief tour, Murph was sent to prison with the rest of the Blues Brothers Band. When the real-life Blues Brothers toured in 1980 to promote the film, Dunne performed live with the band along with Shaffer. His work can be heard on their 1980 album, Made in America. Dunne also appeared in Chesty Anderson, USN (1976), the disaster spoof The Big Bus (1976), Mel Brooks's High Anxiety (1977), three commercial parody films; Tunnel Vision (1976), American Raspberry (1977) and Loose Shoes (1980), and the teen comedy Bad Manners (aka: Growing Pains) (1984). He played a court stenographer in the movie Oh, God! (1977). Later films include The Main Event (1979), The Last Married Couple in America (1980), Honky Tonk Freeway (1981), Perfect (1985), Hero and the Terror (1988), Phoenix (1998) and The Mothman Prophecies (2002). He has also acted in numerous television shows including Night Court as well as working as a voice actor, and can be heard in Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex and in the game, Star Trek: Klingon Academy.

Edwards's parents were Belfast Catholics who relocated to Waterford. His father served, and died, in the British Army during the First World War. His elder brother, Jack Edwards, was the Waterford organiser of the one-day general strike against the enforcement of conscription in Ireland. Jack was active in the Irish War of Independence and then joined the Irregulars in the Irish Civil War. In Kilkenny Gaol, he was shot \\"trying to escape\\" as a reprisal for a Free State officer killed in Waterford.MacEoin 1987 p.4 He trained as a national school teacher in De La Salle College, Waterford.Frank Edwards While teaching at Mount Sion Christian Brothers School, Waterford, Frank Edwards became the Waterford leader of the Republican Congress in 1934. The Roman Catholic Church had denounced the Congress and advised against participation in its foundation meeting. When Edwards denounced local slum- landlords, not realising that some of the property was owned by the Catholic Church, this brought him to the notice of Archdeacon William Byrne. Edwards was investigated by the Church authorities and Bishop Jeremiah Kinane ordered he leave his teaching post. Edwards was supported at first by his union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and a national scandal ensued; but the Church stood firm, stating that the Congress had betrayed \\"The Republic\\" and sought to install \\"the Russian model\\".See Se√°n Cronin, Frank Ryan: The Search for the Republic, (Dublin: Repsol, 1980), . In late 1936 Edwards went to Spain as a member of the Connolly Column, fought in the Front at Lopera (where only 66 of the 150 Irish engaged did not become casualties) and was wounded at Las Rozas on the Madrid Front. With his wife Bobbie, Nora Harkin, John Swift and others, Edwards was one of the founders of the Ireland-USSR Society in 1966. He returned to Ireland, where he was now blacklisted, lost a post with Pye Radio for organising a union, worked as a labourer laying pipes, and, at the outbreak of the Second World War, found a teaching post at Zion School, a Jewish foundation on the South Circular Road. He retired thirty years later from this \\"temporary\\" post, and died in 1983 after a long illness.

IQC was founded in 2002 primarily through a donation made by Mike Lazaridis and his wife Ophelia whose substantial donations have continued over the years. The institute is now located in the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre and the Research Advancement Centre at the University of Waterloo. It is led by founder and physicist, Raymond Laflamme with researchers based in 6 departments across 3 faculties at the University of Waterloo. In addition to theoretical and experimental research on quantum computing, IQC also hosts academic conferences and workshops, short courses for undergraduate and high school students, and scientific outreach events including open houses and tours for the public. Mission The IQC seeks to harness quantum mechanics to develop transformational technologies that will benefit society and become a new engine of economic development in the 21st century. It aims to develop and advance quantum information science and technology at the highest international level through the collaboration of computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and physical scientists. The institute's three strategic objectives have been stated as: #To establish Waterloo as a world- class centre for research in quantum technologies and their applications. #To become a magnet for highly qualified personnel in the field of quantum information. #To establish IQC as the authoritative source of insight, analysis and commentary on quantum information. History The Institute for Quantum Computing was officially created in 2002, sparked by Research In Motion co-founder Mike Lazaridis and then-president of the University of Waterloo, David Johnston, for research into quantum information. Since inception, Lazaridis has provided more than $100 million in private funding for IQC. The institute is a collaboration between academia, the private sector, and the federal and provincial governments. Raymond Laflamme is the founding executive director. At its establishment, the institute was composed of only a handful of researchers from the Departments of Computer Science and Physics. Ten years later, there are more than 200 researchers across six departments within the Faculties of Science, Mathematics, and Engineering at the University of Waterloo. In 2008, IQC moved into the Research Advancement Centre 1 (RAC I) in the University of Waterloo's Research & Technology Park. In 2010, research operations expanded into the adjacent building, Research Advancement Centre 2 (RAC II). In 2012, IQC expanded into the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre. The 285,000-square-foot facility is shared with the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, and is built to stringent standards (controls for vibration, humidity, temperature, and electromagnetic radiation) for quantum and nanotechnology experiments. The building was designed by Toronto-based firm Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB). Research Research at IQC focuses on three main applications of quantum information science and technology using the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The three applications are quantum computing, which encompasses the manipulation and storage of quantum information; quantum communication, which is related to the transmission of quantum information; and quantum sensing, which is used to detect signals or stimuli that are present in the nanoscopic world. Areas of research currently studied at IQC include: * Nanoelectronics-based quantum information processing * Quantum algorithms * Quantum complexity * Quantum cryptography * Quantum error correction and fault tolerance * Quantum information theory * Optical quantum information processing * Spin-based quantum information processing In collaboration with the University of Waterloo, IQC offers research positions and advanced courses in the foundations, applications, and implementation of quantum information processing for graduate students. In addition, IQC also offers an interdisciplinary graduate program in Quantum Information which leads to MMath, MSc, MASc, and PhD degrees. =Research Breakthroughs= IQC researchers have frequently made novel theoretical discoveries or performed novel experiments within their respective fields. 2019 *World first tapered semiconductor nanowire array avalanche photodetector with high speed, efficiency and excellent time resolution at room temperature. 2018 *New methods to produce and detect optical and matter-wave spin-orbit states. *Generation of three-photon entanglement on a superconducting chip using a new, scalable technique. *New methods for preventing leakage errors due to cavity modes. *New broadband, two-phase grating neutron interferometer technique. *New hardware and mathematical algorithms allow high resolution magnetic resonance imaging below two nanometres. *New technique to capture images of ultrafast energy-time entangled photon pairs. 2017 *First step in generating entangled photon triplets in a solid state system. *First violation of Bell‚Äôs inequality in a photonic nanostructure with enhanced light extraction efficiency. *New causal structures only found in the quantum world. *First violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality on a three-level quantum system. *Demonstration of area law scaling of entanglement entropy in a real quantum fluid for the first time. *New method for measuring the length of an optical cavity without any initial calibration. *New etching and bonding technique to isolate superconducting circuits from environmental interference. *Development of an inexpensive, simplistic and portable LED-based spectrophotometer. *Creation of single photon generator able to shape photons on-demand to increase efficiency in quantum communications. *First observation of genuine three-photon interference.

He was the Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull East for 13 years, and served the city as a Justice of the Peace and as High Steward. He helped establish Reckitt and Sons, a manufacturer of household goods, as one of Kingston upon Hull's foremost businesses. His career with the company spanned 61 years‚Äîfrom his initial employment as a confidential and shorthand clerk until his death, as chairman, in 1930. In the House of Commons, Ferens spoke to further the cause of Women's Rights. He supported women's suffrage at home, and repeatedly drew attention to the trafficking of women and girls in the colonies. But never a great orator, and by nature a retiring man, much of his work at Westminster was completed in the committee rooms, away from the limelight. He did not seek re-election after being unseated in an acrimonious campaign in 1918. A devout Wesleyan Methodist, Ferens made numerous charitable donations throughout his life. His gifts to Hull include the Ferens Art Gallery and a donation of ¬£250,000 for the establishment of University College (now the University of Hull). He is memorialized in the University's motto: Lampada Ferens. In other parts of the country he made substantial donations to schools, hospitals and charitable organisations. Early life =Childhood and early career= Ferens was born on 4 May 1847 in East Thickley, a village close to the market town of Bishop Auckland, County Durham. His place of birth has also been recorded as Shildon. He was the third of the seven children of George Waller Ferens (1817‚Äì1893), a flour miller, and his wife, Anne, n√©e Jackson. After attending Bishop Auckland private school until the age of 13, he found employment as a clerk in the Shildon office of the mineral department of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Six years later, he left home for Stockton where he worked as a clerk to Head, Wrightson & Co. A committed autodidact, he taught himself grammar, arithmetic, mechanics, and shorthand. At weekends he taught at Sunday school and enjoyed playing cricket. In 1868, after working in Stockton for two years, he left to take up a post as a confidential shorthand clerk to James Reckitt of Reckitt and Sons in Kingston upon Hull. =Family life= In Hull, Ferens continued to teach in Sunday School, a practice he began during his time in Stockton. While teaching at the Brunswick Sunday School he met Ester Ellen (Ettie) Field, a fellow teacher and a wealthy merchant's daughter of \\"rather masculine appearance.\\" They married in 1873 at Sculcoates Registry Office; and they continued to teach at the Sunday School for the rest of their lives. Though Ettie remained childless, the couple adopted her nephew, John Johnson Till (known as Till), in 1880. Till Ferens separated from his wife and became estranged from his adoptive parents during the 1914‚Äì18 war. Till Ferens, like Thomas, was a Liberal and stood for the Liberal Party at Gainsborough in the 1935 general election. A career in industry Reckitt and Sons was already a successful firm when Ferens joined it in 1868. It produced household wares such as starch, washing blue and black lead. It had been acquired by Isaac Reckitt, a Quaker, in 1840 and was now run by his sons, also Quakers, George (1825‚Äì1900), Francis (1827‚Äì1917) and James (1833‚Äì1924). Ferens was industrious and forward-thinking; he moved swiftly through the company's managerial ranks. In 1874 he became works manager with a share in profits; in 1879, secretary; in 1880, general manager. He joined the board of directors in 1888 when Reckitt and Sons became a private joint-stock company. When James Reckitt died, 36 years later, Ferens was named joint chairman. Under the guidance of Ferens and James Reckitt, the company flourished, becoming one of the most successful in the city. It opened offices in London and New York and expanded into pharmaceuticals‚Äîa natural progression from its disinfectants business. Such that a commonphrase is used to describe Ferens, \\"'Reckitt's Blue made Ferens' gold\\". Dettol was launched in 1932. Politics and public life Thomas Ferens in 1906, the year he was elected to parliament In 1894 Ferens was appointed a Justice of the Peace. In 1911 he was made a Freeman of the City of Hull. He entered parliament as Liberal member for Kingston upon Hull East in 1906 after an unsuccessful bid for the same seat six years earlier. In 1912 King George V appointed him to the Privy Council, and in the same year he became High Steward of Hull. He was not a frequent speaker in parliament but he chaired several committees and was a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union before the First World War. Hansard, the printed record of parliamentary debates, records that his first parliamentary contribution related to schools in orphan homes, and his last to the health of troops in Palestine. A recurrent theme in Ferens' parliamentary contributions is Women's Rights. In 1910 he presented a petition in favour of the enfranchisement of women. In 1912, when the House discussed an allegedly inflammatory speech by Emmeline Pankhurst, Ferens wondered whether her speech might have been influenced by the \\"example of some Privy counsellors.\\" The following year, he asked several questions regarding slave-trading in women; including the trade in West African women, and the trade of European and Japanese women to India. In 1917 he questioned the Home Secretary on the role of women in the police force. Ferens' personal and religious convictions are evident in other of his parliamentary contributions. He tabled a number of questions concerning temperance, both at home and in the colonies. His first question in the Commons was about orphan schools. He later asked about railway accidents to children, and about trafficking of young girls in India. In 1915 Ferens opened a parliamentary debate on the increase in the cost of living caused by the war, which was \\"causing much hardship, especially to the poor.\\" He noted that \\"Many labourers' families have now to be content, owing to the high price of the necessaries of life, with one meal of meat in the week.\\" In replying, the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, agreed that prices were high but he felt they were not as high as might have been expected considering the scale of the global conflict. He remarked that the current high prices were not without precedent, even in peacetime; the price of coal was no higher than it had been in 1875. Ferens also intervened on behalf of his constituency and its inhabitants. In April 1913 he drew the attention of the Postmaster-General to the case of a post office sorting-clerk who was having difficulties claiming his pension. On 10 August 1916, after a fatal raid by a Zeppelin in the early of the previous morning, against which the city had been able to muster only a single searchlight and one gun, he asked that adequate defences be provided and brought to action where necessary. The 1918 election campaign was acrimonious and Ferens was subjected to personal attacks accusing him of being a Little Englander. In reporting on the four contested Hull seats, The Times spoke of \\"Slashing attacks, covert insults, challenges, defiances and the incessant chatter of other weapons... .\\" It noted that Ferens' opponent, Charles Murchinson, was \\"busy digging out 'Little Navy‚Äô speeches of Mr Ferens in 1909 [cf. 'Little Englander'] ... .\\" Murchinson was elected and Ferens resolved never to stand again. After the war he became an active supporter of the League of Nations. Away from politics, Ferens was an important figure in the nonconformist community although, typically, he stayed out of the limelight. In a survey of the personalities of Free Church leaders, the Times noted that \\"among the most respected counsellors of Nonconformity are men who seldom figure on platforms\\", and went on to list Ferens among their number. \\"The leadership of Nonconformity is largely in the hands of laymen\\", it commented. In 1924 Ferens attempted to intervene on behalf William George Smith, a ship's painter who had been sentenced to death for murder at York Assizes. A telegram addressed to the King was sent in the early hours of 9 December appealing for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. But the appeal was unsuccessful and Smith was executed at Hull Gaol later that morning. Temperance Ferens was a lifelong teetotaller and a strong advocate of temperance. In his youth he attended Band of Hope meetings. In 1913 he was elected treasurer of the United Kingdom Alliance. In 1923 he shared a platform with the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Mansion House. The occasion was the inaugural meeting of the National United Campaign of the Churches, which was organised by The Temperance Council of the Christian Churches of England and Wales. The campaign's objectives were to present \\"the modern scientific indictment of alcoholic beverages and its moral implications\\", and to \\"rally local support for the Council‚Äôs immediate legislative program\\", which included the prohibition of the sale of alcohol to persons under the age of 18, and the banning of the sale of alcohol on Sundays. But the Campaign was firmly opposed to prohibition, as is plain in The Times report of the Archbishop's address: \\"To his mind prohibition was the very antithesis of temperance (Cheers.) It was an open confession of failure.\\" Ferens donated ¬£1,000 to a fund established to accomplish the aims of the campaign. Philanthropy The Ferens Boating Lake, East Park, Hull in 1914, two years after Ferens donated the land to the city From the time he started earning a salary, Ferens allocated 10% of his income to charity. His personal wealth increased quickly, in line with the growth of Reckitt and Sons, affording him the opportunity to make ever more generous donations. This he deemed \\"one of the greatest blessings of my life.\\" By 1920 he was distributing ¬£47,000 out of his annual income of ¬£50,000. In 1917 Ferens purchased a plot of land in Queen Victoria Square in Hull city centre. The land was the site of a former church, Saint John's. Later in the year he wrote to the council, informing them that he intended to donate the land to the city, and that he would also donate shares in Reckitt and Sons worth ¬£35,000. In his letter, which was read out at a council meeting, Ferens explained that the shares and the land were to be used to build an art gallery. Nine years later the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone for the Ferens Art Gallery. Afterwards, the Prince visited the premises of Reckitt and Sons where he was greeted by the company's workforce which now numbered 6000. The Ferens Art Gallery finally opened in 1927. Educational establishments and hospitals were often the beneficiaries of Ferens‚Äô munificence. In 1924 he donated ¬£30,000 to extend Kingswood School for Boys, Bath. A year later, the Queen opened an extension to Farringtons Girls School, Chislehurst, Kent, which Ferens had made possible with a donation of a similar amount. In the same year a new post-graduate Theological College, to which he had donated ¬£17,000, was opened in Cambridge for the training of Wesleyan ministers. In February 1927 Ferens formally handed over the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology to Prince Arthur, which he had made possible by a donation of ¬£20,000. In handing over the institute, Ferens said that he hoped that it would attract workers from all parts of the Empire, and from countries outside it. Ferens donated ¬£250,000 for the establishment of University College, now the University of Hull. In 1925 Ferens made his largest single donation. He wrote to the Lord Mayor of Kingston upon Hull to inform him that he intended to donate ¬£250,000 towards the foundation of a university college in the city. The college would be built in the west of city on an eighteen and a half acre site, which Ferens had previously donated. The Duke of York laid the foundation stone in 1928, and Prince George opened the new college in 1929. Ferens became the college's first president, and is memorialized its motto: \\"Lampada Ferens\\"‚Äî\\"carrying the light (of learning)\\". The dove in the university's logo, which signifies peace, is taken from Ferens' coat of arms. Ferens remained a modest man; he saw giving as a moral duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster's speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: > The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with > Mr Ferens‚Äôs benefactions in other parts of the country; this is not the > first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know > the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on > my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which > the Kingswood School owes him today. Legacy In March 1930, ill health prevented Ferens from attending the company's Annual Meeting. It was the first he had missed in 50 years. He had not fulfilled any public engagements for some weeks; nevertheless, he wrote out his speech and it was presented by Sir Harold Reckitt. In the speech Ferens was again able to present the board with pleasing figures. The net profit was ¬£1,277,683, an increase of ¬£33,108 over 1928, which was itself a record year. It was a source of great gratification for him \\"to be able to say that the most cordial relations exist between the workers, the management and the board\\". Ferens died in his home, Holderness House, in East Hull on 9 May 1930. Hettie had predeceased him eight years earlier. In his will he bequeathed the house and its grounds, together with an endowment of ¬£50,000, to be used as a rest home for poor gentlewomen and to be preserved as an open space for East Hull. , the house continues to be run as a residential home for ladies. The year after his death, a pageant was held to mark the opening of Ferensway, a major new thoroughfare in the centre of the city. The Times reported that it would \\"rank as one of the finest in the North of England\\", and continued, \\"The street is 100 ft wide, 10 ft wider than Regent Street in London.\\" To make way for the new street, a large slum area was cleared of houses. Low-rent housing was provided to those displaced by the new road. Reckitt and Son merged with J&J; Colman in 1938 becoming Reckitt & Colman Ltd. In 1999 that company merged with Benckiser N.V. to become Reckitt Benckiser. In 2006 Reckitt Benckiser acquired Boots Healthcare International for ¬£1.9 billion. Though the company is now headquartered in Slough, the Hull site remains one of the city's most significant employers. In the 21st century, Thomas Ferens' legacy remains woven into fabric of the city of Hull. University college continued to expand, gaining its Royal Charter in 1954. In 1979 it became the first university to be awarded the Queen's award for Technological Achievement. Alumni include John Prescott, Frank Field, Roy Hattersley and Roger McGough. Ferens Art Gallery now houses an internationally renowned permanent collection which includes works by Antonio Canaletto, David Hockney, Stanley Spencer and Henry Moore. Generations of Hull's children have enjoyed summers on the boating lake and drenching, perilous trips aboard its Wicksteed Splashboat. Almshouses which Ferens donated to the city in 1910 still provide shelter to the City's needy almost a century after his death. In 2012 a new secondary school named Thomas Ferens Academy opened in Hull which was named in his honour (the school was renamed Sirius Academy North in 2015).

Early years Campagna was born in Brooklyn to parents from mainland Italy. As a teenager, he joined New York's infamous Five Points Gang of Manhattan. One of Campagna's gang associates was future Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone. In 1919, Campagna was convicted of robbing an Illinois bank and sent to the Pontiac Reformatory in Pontiac, Illinois. In April 1924, Campagna was paroled, but was returned to the reformatory six months later for a parole violation. After his final release in November 1924, Campagna returned to New York.Louis Campagna - Done in by a Grouper By Allan May The American Mafia Capone era Al Capone In 1919, New York mobster Al Capone moved to Chicago to help South Side Gang boss John Torrio deal with rival bootleggers. After Campagna's release from the reformatory, Capone summoned him to Chicago to become his bodyguard.\\"Obit: \\"Capone Gangster Dead in Florida.\\" Associated Press. May 31, 1955. In the long bloody war with the rival North Side Gang, Campagna proved to be a reliable gunman. During this violent period, Campagna reportedly slept on a cot outside Capone's suite at Chicago's Lexington Hotel, ready to protect his boss. Campagna also worked with Calabrian Frankie LaPorte, the Chicago Heights boss, and was believed to be Capone's boss who reported back to the Commission for Chicago. Known for his reckless and unpredictable nature, Campagna attempted to besiege a Chicago police station in November 1927. Bootlegger Joe Aiello, an ally of the North Side Gang, had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe a hotel chef to poison Capone. In retaliation, Capone placed a $50,000 bounty on Aiello. When Campagna discovered that Aiello was in jail on a murder conspiracy charge, he and 20 other Outfit gunmen went to the station to try to get him. When Campagna arrived, the police noticed that he was carrying a handgun and immediately arrested him. The police then placed Campagna in a cell next to Aiello's. An undercover police officer in a nearby cell later overheard the following exchange in Sicilian between the two mobsters: > Campagna: \\"You're dead, dear friend, you're dead. You won't get to the end > of the street still walking.\\" Aiello: \\"Can't we settle this? Give me > fourteen days and I'll sell my stores, my house and everything and quit > Chicago for good. Can't we settle it? Think of my wife and my baby.\\" > Campagna: \\"You dirty rat! You've broke faith with us twice now. You started > this, we'll finish it.\\" On October 23, 1930, Aiello was shot to death while leaving a Chicago apartment. During the autopsy, a coroner reported removing 59 bullets weighing over a pound from Aiello's body. No one was charged in Aiello's murder. Labor racketeering Following Capone's 1931 conviction for tax evasion, Campagna rose through the Outfit ranks as an extortionist and labor racketeer under Outfit boss Paul \\"The Waiter\\" Ricca. In 1934, Campagna invested approximately $1,500 of his own money in two illegal gambling dens in Cicero, Illinois. He would eventually net $75,000 per year from this investment. In 1935, Campagna participated in the Outfit infiltration of the Chicago Bartenders & Beverage Dispensers Union. In 1940, the union head obtained a temporary injunction against Campagna and other Outfit members. However, when the case went to trial, the union leader refused to testify and case was dismissed. In 1943, Campagna and his associates stole about $900,000 from the treasury of the Retail Clerks International Protective Association, Local 1248, in Chicago. The funds were never recovered.Part 1 Virgil Peterson Testimony to Kefauver Committee July 6, 1950 The American Mafia During the early 1940s, Campagna extorted $1 million from the U.S. film industry through the takeover of the International Alliance of Theatrical, Stage Employees & Motion Picture Operators Union in Los Angeles. When Willie Morris Bioff, Campagna's front man with the union, was arrested on another charge, he sent word to Campagna that he wanted to leave the Outfit. Campagna then visited Bioff in prison and gave him the following answer: > Anybody who resigns, resigns feet first.\\" After this encounter, the frightened Bioff became a government witness and assisted in the 1943 extortion case against Campagna. Prison On March 18, 1943, Campagna and other Outfit mobsters were indicted in New York on charges of extorting the Hollywood film industry. On December 22, 1943, Campagna was convicted of extortion. He was sentenced a week later to ten years imprisonment in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary.\\"The Guileless Gangster\\" by Allan May Crime Magazine Louis then turned to his cousin Albert Campagna for help. However, Albert wanted nothing to do with his Louis for fear that his children would become targets. Soon after Louis' imprisonment, his wife Charlotte successfully petitioned the government to transfer him closer to Chicago at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. In the late 1940s, a group of Campagna associates collected over $190,000 to pay his tax debt to the federal government (reduced from $470,000). In August 1947, after 42 months in prison, Campagna was released on parole his first of eligibility. Outfit boss Anthony Accardo had reportedly bribed a district attorney to facilitate Campagna's quick release. The rapid parole of Campagna and his associates created a firestorm of protest in Chicago. The U.S. Department of Justice went to court to revoke the parole, but was unsuccessful.\\"The Big Pardon\\" The New Criminologist After his release, Campagna returned to Chicago to work for the Outfit under boss Sam Giancana.Part 1 Kefauver Committee Interim Report #3 May 1, 1951 American Mafia Final years In the early 1950s, Campagna was summoned to testify before the U.S. Senate in the Kefauver Hearings on organized crime. However, apart from revealing his income from the Cicero gambling operations, Campagna did not provide any useful testimony.Corngold, Joe Organized Crime and Criminals In his later years, Campagna spent time at his two farms in Fowler, Indiana and Berrien Springs, Michigan, as well as his house in Berwyn, Illinois. On May 30, 1955, Campagna was fishing on his lawyer's boat in Biscayne Bay in Florida. After reeling in a 30-pound (13.6 kg.) grouper fish, Campagna suffered a fatal heart attack. Since the Catholic Church denied Campagna a church funeral, the memorial service was held at a funeral home in Berwyn, Illinois. Campagna was buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery, in Hillside, Illinois, in what observers described as the most lavish mob funeral since Capone's death.\\"Mob Leaders Bury Campagna In Lavish Funeral\\" Midwest Mafia.com References Further reading   * External links * Category:1900 births Category:1955 deaths Category:American mobsters of Italian descent Category:Al Capone associates Category:Chicago Outfit mobsters Category:Mafia hitmen Category:Prohibition- era gangsters Category:American people convicted of tax crimes ","title":"Louis Campagna"},{"id":"7952969","text":"Canyon Ridge High School is a public secondary school in Twin Falls, Idaho, operated by the Twin Falls School District #411.

He worked in the businesses with his brothers Al Capone and Ralph Capone. Early life Capone was born in 1895 in Brooklyn, and he was the third son of the Italian immigrants Gabriele Capone (1865‚Äì1920) and Teresa Raiola (1867-1952). He was the brother of Vincenzo, Ralph, Al, Ermina, John, Albert, Matthew and Mafalda Capone. Frank and his brothers Al and Ralph became mobsters. Growing up in New York, both Frank and Al became involved in the Five Points Gang with mobster John Torrio. By 1918, Torrio had moved to Chicago to help a relative defend his rackets, and Torrio soon asked Al and later Frank to join him there. By 1920, Torrio had taken charge of the South Side Gang and the Prohibition era had started. As the gang increased in power and wealth, so did Al and Frank. Takeover of Cicero In 1923, Chicago voters elected a new mayor, William Dever, who proceeded to crack down on Torrio, the Capone brothers, and their South Side Gang. In response, Torrio tasked Al with creating speakeasies, brothels, and illegal gambling dens in Cicero, a Chicago suburb. Within a year, Capone had placed the Cicero city manager Joseph Z. Klenha and the town committeemen on the gang payroll. Frank Capone's job was to represent the gang in its dealings with the Cicero town council. Frank was mild-mannered compared to his brother Al, projecting the image of a respectable businessman, and always dressed in a neat suit.The Brothers Capone by Allan May Crime Magazine In the April 1, 1924 Cicero municipal election, Democratic Party politicians mounted a serious election challenge to Republican Klenha and his associates. To protect the gang's political control of Cicero, Frank unleashed a wave of terror on the city. He sent South Side gang members to the polling booths with submachine guns and sawed-off shotguns to make sure that local residents \\"voted right\\". Uncooperative voters were assaulted and blocked from voting. Frank led an attack on an opponent's campaign headquarters, ransacking his office and assaulting several campaign workers. One campaign worker was shot in both legs and detained with eight other campaign workers, to be released when Election Day was over. Death and police reinforcements As the election day turmoil progressed, outraged Cicero citizens petitioned Cook County Judge Edmund J. Jareki for help. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) sent 70 plainclothes officers to Cicero to maintain order at the polls and Jareki swore them in as deputy sheriffs. The CPD officers did not arrive on the streets of Cicero until late afternoon, at which point they had little effect on the election- related violence. Around dusk, a detective squad led by Sergeant William Cusack pulled up to the polling station at Cicero Avenue and Twenty-second Street after spotting Frank Capone, Charlie Fischetti, and a short, heavyset man they didn't recognize. The detectives exited their car and began walking over when gunfire inexplicably erupted. Several witnesses later claimed that the gangsters never opened fire. At the later inquest, the police claimed that Frank Capone shot first; they produced a pistol with three missing rounds that they swore he used. Frank allegedly thought these officers in civilian clothing were rival gangsters. In either event, Capone was fatally shot many times by Sergeant Phillip J. McGlynn in the ensuing melee. Fischetti sprinted across a nearby vacant lot, only to toss down his weapon and surrender once the police caught up with him. The third gangster ran south, firing a gun in each hand, and managed to escape. An urban myth later grew that this man was none other than Al Capone. In fact, the third gunman was later positively identified as one David Hedlin; the police had wounded him, as well. At the end of the day, the Capone candidate Klenha had won.\\"AL CAPONE\\" TruTV Crime Library Mob funeral After Frank's death, the Chicago newspapers were full of articles either praising or condemning the CPD. A coroner's inquest later determined that Frank's killing was a justifiable shooting since Frank had been resisting arrest. On April 4, 1924, Frank Capone received an extravagant funeral, with $20,000 worth of flowers placed around the silver-plated casket and over 150 cars in the motorcade. Al purchased the flowers from a shop belonging to his North Side Gang rival, Dean O'Banion. Frank was interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery outside Chicago. The Chicago Tribune reported that the event was appropriate for \\"a fitting gentleman\\". Out of respect for his dead brother, Al Capone closed the gambling dens and speakeasies of Cicero for two hours during the funeral. In popular culture Morgan Spector portrayed Frank Capone in the fourth season of the HBO television show Boardwalk Empire. In the show, Frank is portrayed as charismatic and level-headed, often attempting to cool Al's temper.

He got the nickname \\"Bottles\\" not from involvement in the Capone bootlegging empire, but from his running the legitimate non-alcoholic beverage and bottling operations in Chicago. Further family lore suggests that the nickname was specifically tied to his lobbying the Illinois Legislature to put into law that milk bottling companies had to stamp the date that the milk was bottled on the bottle. He was most famous for being named by the Chicago Crime Commission \\"Public Enemy Number Three\\" when his brother Al was \\"Public Enemy Number One\\". Early life Capone was born in 1894, in Angri, a small town in Campania, Italy, near Mount Vesuvius, and he was the middle son of Gabriele and Teresa (n√©e Raiola) Capone. He had eight siblings, Vicenzo, Frank, Al, Ermina, John, Matthew Capone and Mafalda Maritote. He arrived in America on a ship named Werra on June 18, 1895 with his older brother Vincenzo and mother Theresa, entering via Ellis Island. His father had come to the United States by the way of Canada, six months previously. They settled in Brooklyn, living near the Navy yards. On September 24, 1915 at the age of 21 he married Filomena (Florence) Muscato, age 17. They had a son, Ralph Gabriel Capone in 1917. Life in Chicago After the death of his father Gabriel in November 1920, Ralph was brought to Chicago by his younger brother, Al. His wife didn't want to move so Ralph took Ralph Jr. to Chicago where he was raised by his mother as her youngest child. Ralph Sr. returned to New York in 1921 and got a divorce decree from Florence on the charge of abandonment. In 1923, he married for the second time to Velma Pheasant. They had no children and divorced in March 1938.https://newspaperarchive.com/oakland-tribune/1938-03-10/page-15 Capone was placed in charge of the Chicago Outfit's bottling plants during Prohibition. The Outfit was attempting to monopolize non-alcoholic beverages and soft drinks (specifically ginger ale and soda water, commonly used in mixed drinks) during this period when the sale of alcohol was banned. Ralph Capone made large profits for the Outfit and became the dominant soft drink vendor other than Coca-Cola during the 1933 World's Fair. In April 1930, the elder Capone was included in Frank J. Loesch's Chicago Crime Commission \\"Public Enemies\\" list. He was Public Enemy #3, while his brother Al was Public Enemy #1.

Following Al Capone's conviction for tax evasion in 1931, Ralph Capone remained with the Outfit. He hosted several high-level Outfit conferences at his brother's residence in Palm Island, Florida. As the manager of Chicago's Cotton Club, Capone was reportedly involved in syndicate gambling and vice districts. In 1932, he was also convicted of tax evasion and served three years.Crime Library In many ways, the elder Capone was a front man for the Outfit. Authorities once described him as an \\"elder statesman\\" of the Outfit. In 1950, the United Press described Capone as \\"‚Ä¶in his own right‚Ä¶ one of the overlords of the national syndicate which controls gambling, vice, and other rackets\\". In actuality, Ralph held relatively little power in the Outfit and the National Crime Syndicate. This finally became evident during his testimony before the U.S. Senate Kefauver Committee, in 1950. In the 1930s, Capone purchased a home and later managed a hotel/tavern in Mercer, Wisconsin. The hotel was named \\"The Rex Hotel\\" and the tavern was named, \\"Billy's Bar\\".Travel Wisconsin Gangster Tour After Capone's release from prison, he moved to Wisconsin and lived there until his death.

If emotions are feelings, emotives are the expressions of those feelings through the use of language, specifically through constructions that explicitly describe emotional states or attitudes. (Luke 2004). Origin The term was introduced by William M. Reddy in his article, Against Constructionism: The Historical Ethnography of Emotions (1997). Reddy is a Professor of History and Cultural Anthropology at Duke University. Description Emotives describe the process by which emotions are managed and shaped, not only by society and its expectations but also by individuals themselves as they seek to express the inexpressible, namely how they \\"feel\\" (Rosenwein 2002). One important difference between emotive and descriptive use of language is the difference in intention. The discourse of a man using language emotively, using it to express or to arouse feelings, differs in intention from the discourse of a man using language descriptively to convey descriptive meanings (Castell 1949). Emotion claims are attempts to translate into words (1) nonverbal events that are occurring in this halo or (2) enduring states of this halo and this background. Emotion claims, as a result, can be viewed, by analogy with speech act theory, as constituting a special class of utterance, [called emotives] (Reddy 1999). Reddy tells us in his later writing that emotives are similar to performatives in that emotives do things to the world. Emotives are themselves instruments for directly changing, building, hiding, and intensifying emotions (Reddy 1999). Ultimately, expressed emotions, i.e. emotives, may be more important than inner states of emotion in constructing a social reality (Luke 2004). Sincerity William Reddy includes the idea of sincerity as a key point in the effects of emotive. The concept of emotives forces a redefinition of sincerity. Because of the powerful and unpredictable effects of emotional utterances on the speaker, sincerity should not be considered the natural, best, or most obvious state toward which individuals strive. On the contrary, probably the most obvious orientation toward the power of emotives is a kind of fugitive instrumentalism (Reddy 1999). One might say that, just as a performative can be happy or unhappy, an emotive brings emotional effects appropriate to its content or effects that differ markedly from its content. If it does bring up appropriate effects, then the emotive, in Western context, might be said to be \\"sincere\\"; if it does not, the emotive may be claimed, after the fact, to be hypocrisy, an evasion, a mistake, a projection, or a denial (Reddy 1997). Emotives are both self-exploring and self-altering (Reddy 1999). Emotive in Sociology The concept of emotive is compatible with J√ºrgen Habermas‚Äôs critique of poststructuralists on the grounds that their theory involves them in a ‚Äúperformative contradiction‚Äù ‚Äì because they appear to speak and write with the intention of persuading us there are no intentions. However, the concept of emotives also points toward a modification of Habermas's notion of communicative rationality, since in formulating emotives speakers are trying to communicate with themselves as much as with others (Reddy 1997; Koury, 2004). Other connections to sociology involve emotives and emotionology, whereas emotionology sets standards only for others, the \\"you\\" of the advice manuals, emotives set standards for you, me, and them‚Äîthe people involved in all emotive interactions. Thus Reddy emphasizes the vocabulary of emotion, for only as people articulate their feelings can they \\"know\\" what they feel and, reflecting on their newfound knowledge, feel yet more (Rosenwein 2002). Finally, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), developed by American psychologist Albert Ellis, is solution- aimed therapy that focuses on teaching patients how to change their \\"irrational beliefs by verbal and behavioral counter-propagandizing activity\\" (Ellis). It is thought here that human beings on the basis of their belief system actively, though not always consciously, disturb themselves, and even disturb themselves about their disturbances (Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy).

Early years Carbo was born in Agrigento, Sicily on August 10, 1904. Carbo was sent to the New York State Reformatory for juvenile delinquents at age eleven. Over the next ten years, Carbo would be in and out of prison on charges including assault and grand larceny. During this period, Carbo was arrested for the murder of a taxi driver who refused to pay protection money. Pleading not guilty, Carbo claimed self-defense. He eventually agreed to a plea bargain of manslaughter in exchange for a reduced sentence of two to four years in prison. After serving 20 months in prison, Carbo was released. Prohibition With the passage of Prohibition, he began working as a hired gunman for several bootlegger gangs. In 1931, Carbo was charged with the murder of Philadelphia mobster Michael \\"Mickey\\" Duffy in Atlantic City, New Jersey; however, Carbo was eventually released. During the early 1930s, Carbo began working for Murder, Inc. under boss Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter. Murder record By the end of the 1930s, Carbo had been arrested 17 times and had been charged with five more murders. In 1939, Carbo allegedly participated in the murder of informant Harry \\"Big Greenie\\" Greenberg in California; he was arrested for it two years later. This time, former Murder Inc. members Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles and Allie \\"Tick Tock\\" Tannenbaum agreed to testify against Carbo. However, before the trial began, Reles, who was under police protection, fell to his death from a window of the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island.

From the start of his pro career in 1953, Liston had been \\"owned\\" by St. Louis mobster John Vitale, who continued to own a stake in the boxer. At the time Palermo and Carbo acquired their interest in Liston, the notorious Carbo was imprisoned on Rikers Island, having been convicted of the undercover management of prize-fighters and unlicensed matchmaking.

Further legal troubles and death In the late 1950s, Carbo started running into legal troubles. First, he was convicted of managing boxers without a license and was sentenced to two years in the New York City jail on Riker's Island. Following his release in 1960, Carbo was subpoenaed to appear before a Senate investigation committee to testify on his involvement in professional boxing. Carbo took the Fifth Amendment 25 times, answering \\"I cannot be compelled to be a witness against myself\\". In 1961, Carbo and boxing promoter Frank \\"Blinky\\" Palermo were charged with conspiracy and extortion against the National Boxing Association welterweight Champion Don Jordan. After a three-month trial, in which U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy served as prosecutor, Carbo was sentenced to 25 years in prison, serving his sentence at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in California, McNeil Island in Washington state and United States Penitentiary, Marion in Illinois.A Report on Chicago crime.

With lieutenants Nicholas \\"The Choir Boy\\" Viana, only age 18, and Frank Campione, Cardinelli led one of the most dominant Black Hand gangs in Chicago prior to Prohibition. Robbing hundreds of hotels, speakeasies, and illegal gambling parlors throughout the decade, the Cardinelli gang terrorized Chicago's Little Italy through a six-year bombing campaign between 1915 and 1918. This murderous campaign resulted in 20 deaths and hundreds wounded (Viana was suspected in at least 15 murders alone). Cardinelli's organization would remain the leading Italian-American criminal organization in the city, including the Johnny Torrio-Al Capone gang, during the early years of Prohibition. Cardinelli, also known as \\"Il Diavolo\\" (The Devil), was arrested by the Chicago police Homicide Squad for the 1919 murder of saloon owner Andrew P. Bowman and sentenced to hang on October 11, 1920. Following a decision by the US Supreme Court on March 4, 1921 supporting the ruling, Cardinelli was executed on Apr 15, 1921. On the day of his execution, Cardinelli refused to walk to the gallows. He was strapped to a chair, carried to the gallows, and was hanged, chair and all. After the execution, the jail attendants took his body to an ambulance, which had been hired by his family. Inside, a jail attendant noticed a nurse, a doctor, and another man, as well as hot water bottles. The attendant contacted a deputy warden, who delayed the body for an hour. When it was finally released, a guard saw the nurse rub Cardinelli's cheeks and wrists, and the doctor prepare an injection. A police car stopped the ambulance, and the apparent attempt to revive the dead mobster. (The ambulance was found to have a specially heated bed, an oxygen tank, an electric battery and various syringes.)

Viana was taken to a room about two blocks from the jail with where he was successfully revived to test the system before Cardinelli's execution.

Early life Anthony Carfano was born in November 1895 on Oliver Street in Manhattan, the son of Giavanni Carfagno and Dongetta Visocchi, both immigrants from Naples, Italy. Early Criminal Career By 1920, he had become a hoodlum for Frankie Yale in Yale's south Brooklyn empire. Yale's organization eventually allied with and was finally absorbed by Joe Masseria's Mafia family, making Yale a caporegime or crew leader under Masseria. When Yale was assassinated in 1928, Carfano took over and became a Masseria caporegime. From the Brooklyn to Miami In the late 1930s, Costello and Joe Adonis sent Carfano to South Florida to expand family operations in that region. Based in Miami, Carfano successfully organized both illegal gambling operations and legitimate spas and hotels, including Miami's Wofford Hotel. At this time, mob associate and Florida gambling operator Meyer Lansky persuaded the Mafia Commission that both Miami and Miami Beach should be considered \\"open cities\\", places in which any crime family in the country could set up operation. Despite Carfano's objections, Costello persuaded him to cooperate with Lansky. By the late 1950s, Carfano had carved out a multimillion-dollar gambling empire in South Florida. Florida crime boss Santo Trafficante, Sr., based in Tampa, controlled the majority of the state, but was closely aligned with the New York bosses and his counterparts in New Orleans. Family power play In the late 1940s, Vito Genovese was extradited from Italy to New York, but managed to escape the murder charges. Genovese now set about retrieving control of the family from Costello. Over the prior decade, Genovese had garnered much support from the \\"blue collar faction\\" of the crime family, the soldiers who carried out the street level crimes and had felt neglected under Costello's rule, while higher level crime family members within the \\"white collar faction\\" led by Costello carried out and oversaw the operations such as union and labor racketeering, stock scams and political corruption. In May 1957, Costello survived an assassination attempt organized by Genovese. Immediately after the attack on Costello, Genovese ordered all the caporegimes in the family to accept him as the new boss. Costello had few allies support him. Costello ally Willie Moretti had been murdered in 1951; Adonis had been deported in 1956; John De Noia and Rocco Pelligrino were retiring. In a show of support for Costello, Carfano flew to New York from Florida to meet with him. In retaliation for supporting Costello, Genovese ordered his right-hand- man and caporegime Anthony \\"Tony Bender\\" Strollo to murder Carfano. Assassination of Carfano On the night of September 25, 1959 (although other sources incorrectly claim September 29), Strollo invited Carfano to dinner at Marino's restaurant and Carfano accepted. Earlier that night, Carfano relaxed at the Copacabana nightclub and later that evening, left to meet with Strollo. At Marino's, Carfano ran into mutual friends, among them Janice Drake, a former Miss New Jersey and the wife of comedian Allan Drake. Drake had been previously called in as a witness to testify on gangland slayings of Manhattan Nathan Nelson and Gambino crime family boss Albert Anastasia. Carfano offered to drive Janice home after supper to her apartment in Rego Park, Queens, where her 13-year-old son, Michael, was sleeping. In the middle of the meal, Carfano allegedly received a phone call. After hanging up, Carfano told his group that he and Drake had to leave; he had been called away \\"on urgent business\\". Carfano and Drake left Marino's and drove away in his Cadillac. Police later theorized that this phone call was from Costello warning Carfano about the hit. When Carfano and Drake left the restaurant, they were allegedly heading to La Guardia Airport in Queens to board a flight to Miami. However, according to this theory, Strollo had anticipated such a move and had hidden gunmen in the back seat of the Cadillac. Once on the road, the gunmen forced Carfano to drive to a quiet location near the airport. At 10:30 that evening, 45 minutes after Carfano and Drake left Marino's, their bodies were found in Carfano's car near the airport. Both had been shot in the head. Alternative theory on Carfano's murder Another theory regarding Carfano's death lies with his vast gambling empire in South Florida and a belief he was making moves to invest in Cuban casinos at the time of his death. With the emergence of Genovese as the new leader of the Luciano crime family in late 1957, former boss Luciano lost a great deal of underworld influence in New York and America. No longer in control of his crime family, longtime Luciano ally and supporter Meyer Lansky, who had vast gambling interests across America, along with casino interests in Las Vegas and Cuba, was in need of a new sponsor and ally within the former Luciano family. Luciano and Costello had given Lansky underworld protection for decades. Now Lansky sought an alliance with new boss Vito Genovese. Underworld rumor has it that after Costello was deposed as boss of the Luciano crime family in late 1957, Carfano took it upon himself to show much disregard and even contempt for the new leadership. He apparently spent most of his time overseeing his criminal and legitimate interests in South Florida and traveled to New York only when necessary, and by 1959 had begun making plans to expand his gambling operations into Cuba. The theory goes that Carfano, who was not a Genovese supporter, began to encroach on the Havana casino operations of Meyer Lansky and the new Genovese crime family. With Carfano's prior, blatant disrespect for his new boss, Genovese, and now his encroachment onto Genovese and Lansky territory without permission sealed Carfano's fate. This, along with the added bonus that Lansky would take over all the Carfano gambling interests in Florida where Lansky was also based gave the two New York Mob bosses all the excuse they needed to have Carfano hit that fateful September night. The fact that Lansky's criminal association with Genovese strengthened after his takeover of the Luciano crime family and that Lansky did in fact take over Carfano's Southern Florida gambling interests after his death is more than likely the catalyst for this theory surrounding Carfano's murder and Lansky's involvement. In popular culture In Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino (film), the name of the character \\"Artie Piscano\\" (meant to represent real- life Nick Civella's brother-in-law Carl DeLuna) is derived from Anthony Carfano own name. \\"Augie Pisano\\" was played by actor Vinny Vella in the film.

Early history  From 1810 to 1812 Saxony, W√ºrttemberg, Prussia and Bavaria founded a rural police force after the model of the Napoleonic French Gendarmerie. Preu√üischer Landgendarm der XI. Gendarmerie-Brigade Kassel The Prussian Gendarmerie staff (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Landgendarmerie; Royal Prussian State Gendarmerie) were well-proven infantry and cavalry NCOs after serving their standard service time at the army and some COs. Officially they were still military personnel, equipped and paid by the Ministry of War, but in peacetime attached to the Ministry of the Interior, serving as normal or as mounted police. In case of a maneuver, mobilization or war 50% of the Gendarmerie formed the core of military police of the army, called Feldgendarmerie. Should more manpower be needed, regular infantry and cavalry corporals and some COs were seconded to the Feldgendarmerie under supervision of the former Gendarmerie NCOs/COs. The uniform of the Feldgendarmerie was identical with the uniform of the Landgendarmerie. Deutsche Feldgendarmerie in Neu-Sandec Fr√ºhjahr 1915 At the outbreak of the First World War the Feldgendarmerie comprised 33 companies. They each had 60 men and two NCOs. By 1918, the number of companies had been expanded to 115 units. After World War I, all military police units were disbanded and no police units existed in the inter-war Weimar Republic era. Garrisons were patrolled by regular soldiers performing the duties of the military police. Nazi Germany Command pennant for a Feldgendarmerie company during World War II. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Feldgendarmerie were reintroduced into the Wehrmacht. The new units received full infantry training and were given extensive police powers. A military police school was set up at Potsdam, near Berlin to train Feldgendarmerie personnel. Subjects included Criminal code, general and special police powers, reporting duties, passport and identification law, weapons drill, self-defence techniques, criminal police methodology, and general administration. All prospective candidates served at a Feldgendarmerie command after the first term of examinations. Courses lasted one year and failure rates were high: in 1935 only 89 soldiers graduated from an initial intake of 219 candidates. Feldgendarmerie were employed within army divisions and as self-contained units under the command of an army corps. They often worked in close cooperation with the Geheime Feldpolizei (), district commanders and SS and Police Leaders.  World War II  =Operations= occupied Russia, July 1941. The sign says \\"\\"Partisanen-Gefahr von Welish nach U√üwjati. Einzelfahrzeuge halt! Waffen bereithalten.\\" / \\"Partisan danger from Velizh to Usvyaty. Single vehicles Stop! Weapons at the ready.\\" Feldgendarmerie units were generally given occupation duties in territories directly under the control of the Wehrmacht. Their duties policing the areas behind the front lines ranged from straightforward traffic control and population control to suppression and execution of partisans and the apprehension of enemy stragglers. When combat units moved forward out of a region, the Feldgendarmerie role would formally end as control was then transferred to occupation authorities under the control of the Nazi Party and SS. But Feldgendarmerie units are known to have assisted the SS in committing war crimes in occupied areas. Author Antony Beevor explores some well- documented cases of their participation in his book Stalingrad. Also, Felgendarmerie units took active part in Jew hunting operations, including in Western Europe. But by 1943 as the tide of war changed for Nazi Germany, the Feldgendarmerie were given the task of maintaining discipline in the Wehrmacht. Many ordinary soldiers deemed to be deserters were summarily executed by Feldgendarmerie units. This earned them the pejorative Kettenhunde () after the gorget they wore with their uniforms. The arbitrary and brutal policing of soldiers gave them the other nickname Heldenklauer () because they screened refugees and hospital transports for potential deserters with orders to kill suspected malingerers. Rear-echelon personnel would also be checked for passes that permitted them to be away from the front. Feldgendarmerie guard a food truck in the Netherlands in 1945. The Feldgendarmerie also administered the Strafbattalion () which were Wehrmacht punishment units created for soldiers convicted by court martial and sentenced to a deferred execution. During the final days of the war, as the Third Reich crumbled, recruits or soldiers who committed even the slightest infraction were sent to Strafbatallione. The SS-Feldgendarmerie wore the same uniform and gorget as their Army counterparts but had an addition cuff title indicating they were military police. Generally they conducted the same policing role, such as controlling rear areas but they also conducted counter-insurgency and extermination operations with Einsatzgruppen against Jews, partisans and those deemed to be \\"enemies of the Reich\\". These SS units had a severe reputation for being strict enforcers of military law. Nicknamed Kopf J√§ger (Head Hunters), they also tracked down and punished those deemed to be deserters. From 1944 onwards, former members of the Ordnungspolizei serving with the Waffen -SS, were also given military police powers and duties. These special SS-Feldgendarmerie were denoted by a diamond polizei-eagle insignia worn on the lower sleeve. In January 1944 as the Red Army began to advance on the Eastern Front, the power of the Feldgendarmerie was superseded by the creation of the Feldj√§gerkorps. Answering only to the German High Command (OKW), its three regiments were founded to maintain discipline and military cohesion in all branches of the Wehrmacht (including the Feldgendarmerie). Feldj√§gers were recruited from decorated, battle-hardened officers and NCOs. They had the military authority of the OKW to arrest and execute officers and soldiers from either the Wehrmacht or the SS for desertion, defeatism and other duty violations. Every unit of the Feldj√§ger had command of a \\"Fliegendes Standgericht\\" (flying drumhead trial/flying court martial), which comprised three judges.Kalmbach, Peter Lutz (2013): Polizeiliche Ermittlungsorgane der Wehrmachtjustiz. In: Kriminalistik (2013: 118-122). (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259929781_Polizeiliche_Ermittlungsorgane_der_Wehrmachtjustiz) Despite the surrender of all German forces in May 1945, some Feldgendarmerie and Feldj√§gerkorps units in the western zones of occupied Germany were allowed to keep their weapons by the Allies because of the number of POWs that required guarding and processing. For example, the British VIII Corps based in Schleswig-Holstein used an entire regiment of volunteers from the Feldgendarmerie to maintain discipline at its demobilisation center at Meldorf. Re-activated military police, who received extra rations as pay, were identified by an armband stating Wehrmachtordnungstruppe (Armed Forces Order Troop). In June 1946, more than 12 months after the official end of World War II, the Feldgendarmerie became the last German units to surrender their arms. =Organization= A Feldgendarmerie K√ºbelwagen on the Eastern Front in June 1943. The Feldgendarmerie was under the direct control of the German High Command O.K.H. (Oberkommando des Heeres). A Feldgendarmerie major general who was in charge of all Feldgendarmerie personnel attached to the Wehrmacht, was directly subordinated to the Generalquartiermeister. He was responsible for postings and personnel administration, monitoring the performance of the police units, allocation of tasks, traffic regulations and training. His immediate subordinate was a staff officer attached to each Oberkommando Army who commanded the one or more Feldgendarmerie battalions attached to each Wehrmacht formation. The staff officer was responsible for maintaining order and discipline, traffic control during large scale troop movements and maintaining transport routes. Each Feldgendarmerie battalion also had support personnel such as cooks, clerks, and armourers. A battalion was subdivided into smaller-sized Truppen which were attached to each division or corps. A Gruppe, a section sized unit, were then assigned to specific field or local commands. Feldgendarmerie sections would also be temporarily assigned to special operations, such as anti-partisan duties. A typical Truppe attached to an Infantry or Panzer Division would have up to three officers, 41 NCOs and 20 enlisted men. They would operate in K√ºbelwagen, trucks and motorcycles (with sidecars). =Equipment= These battalions were equipped with motorcycles and sidecars, K√ºbelwagen, field cars such as the Horch 4x4 and 3 ton Opel Blitz lorries and a small number of armoured vehicles as a means of transport. =Weapons= Personal weapons consisted of small arms such as the Walther PP which was designed as a civilian police pistol (PP Polizei-Pistole) or the Walther PPK both of which were favoured by officers whereas the Luger P08 and Walther P38 were used by other ranks. Machine pistols were carried by NCOs and the Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle was issued but was not widely used. The MG34 and MG42 were used as vehicle mounted armament for defending road blocks or vehicle checkpoints. Other military police troops Because the Feldgendarmerie did not have enough manpower to fulfill all of their tasks, the Wehrmacht established several military police like troops, some of them with limited authority. * Heeres-/Wehrmachtsstreifendienst * Verkehrsregelungsbataillone * Feldjaegertruppe  Postwar reorganization  The traditional symbol of the Feldj√§gers is the Prussian Gardestern Schwarzen Adlerordens (The order of the black eagle) created by Frederick I of Prussia. With the creation of the Bundeswehr in 1955, many of its branches of service were given names that would at least nominally distinguish them from their logical Wehrmacht equivalents. Thus, military police in the modern Bundeswehr were not called Feldgendarmerie. In fact, the original intent was to call the MPs Milit√§rpolizei, literally military police. However, state officials protested as the law enforcement function in the brand new German constitution had been given primarily to the states, not the federation. The word Polizei (Police) was jealously guarded by the states, so the Federal Defence Ministry searched for a new designation and adopted Feldj√§ger which was a traditional Prussian regiment with some military police type functions.

The restoring force is a function only of position of the mass or particle, and it is always directed back toward the equilibrium position of the system. The restoring force is often referred to in simple harmonic motion. The force which is responsible to restore original size and shape is called restoring force. An example is the action of a spring. An idealized spring exerts a force that is proportional to the amount of deformation of the spring from its equilibrium length, exerted in a direction to oppose the deformation. Pulling the spring to a greater length causes it to exert a force that brings the spring back toward its equilibrium length. The amount of force can be determined by multiplying the spring constant of the spring by the amount of stretch, also known as the Hooke's Law. Another example is of a pendulum. When the pendulum is not swinging all the forces acting on the pendulum are in equilibrium. The force due to gravity and the mass of the object at the end of the pendulum is equal to the tension in the string holding that object up. When a pendulum is put in motion the place of equilibrium is at the bottom of the swing, the place where the pendulum rests. When the pendulum is at the top of its swing the force bringing the pendulum back down to this midpoint is gravity. As a result gravity can be seen as the restoring force in this.

Late pot, probably painted by Fannie circa 1920s. Woolaroc collection. Fannie Nampeyo (1900‚Äì1987) (also known as Fannie Lesou Polacca and Fannie Nampeyo Polacca) was a modern and contemporary fine arts potter, who carried on the traditions of her famous mother, Nampeyo of Hano, the grand matriarch of modern Hopi pottery. Biography =Early life= Fannie Nampeyo Polacca was the youngest of Nampeyo of Hano's three daughters. She was born in the Hopi-Tewa Corn Clan home atop First Mesa, on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. Fannie was initially given the name Popongua or Popong-Mana (meaning \\"Picking Pi√±ons\\") by the older women of her father Lesou's family, and either missionaries or health-care workers later gave her the name \\"Fannie.\\" The highest level of education Fannie Nampeyo completed was third grade. In the early 1920s she married her cousin, Vinton Polacca, going against tradition of marrying outside the Corn Clan. Shortly thereafter pottery making became an important part of Fannie‚Äôs life. The couple moved to Sand Hills where Vinton worked a cattle ranch. There she began taking pottery seriously. From 1934-1937 they lived and worked as ranchers but left ranching so Vinton could work in government schools. The couple took their family to Keams Canyon, where all their children eventually completed high school. While in Keams Canyon, Polacca had a profitable tamale business. During this time, Fannie Nampeyo increasingly worked with her mother Nampeyo, whose eyesight was diminishing due to trachoma. Fannie helped her mother with pottery painting and decorating, and also assisted her father with polishing. Early works created by Fannie and her mother were signed simply \\"Nampeyo\\" by Fannie, since Nampeyo could not read or write, but later they began signing pieces made together as \\"Nampeyo Fannie\\". Pieces made by Fannie alone were signed \\"Fannie Nampeyo\\" and might include a corn symbol drawn in. =Pottery= Fannie was a prolific potter from 1920‚Äì1987 and earned a reputation as an outstanding potter during her lifetime. Her styles included black and red on yellow and black on yellow in the form of jars, cups and saucers. She also made miniatures and bird effigy bowls. Among her favorite designs were clouds, rain, feathers, stars and migrations motifs. In addition to making pottery she also made quilts. Fannie's pottery won a first place blue ribbon in the \\"Hopi Show\\" at the Museum of Northern Arizona in July 1961, and her works have been included in collects by the University of Oklahoma's Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art and The Cleveland Museum of Art. =Later years= Nampeyo became matriarch of the Hopi-Tewa Corn Clan, as her mother Nampeyo had been before her. \\"Nampeyo\\" is actually the ceremonial title used by the matriarch of the Hopi-Tewa Corn Clan. Fannie and her husband Vinton were among the first families at First Mesa to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Fannie had 13 children, although five died shortly after birth. The other seven (Thomas Polacca, Elva Nampeyo, Tonita, Iris Youvella, Leah, Harold and Elsworth) all excelled at pottery making, which they learned from their mother, and several have become known in their own right among collectors of Native American pottery.

The solar savings fraction thus is zero for no solar energy utilization, to 1.0 for all energy provided by solar. The solar savings fraction of a particular system is dependent on many factors such as the load, the collection and storage sizes, the operation, and the climate. As an example, the same solar-thermal water heating system installed in a single- family house in Arizona might have f=0.75 (75%), while in a much colder and cloudier climate, like Pittsburgh, PA, might only have a solar fraction of f=0.3 (30%) or so. Great care is thus needed in designing such systems, and in evaluating their economics. To increase the solar savings fraction, energy conservation measures should be employed first before expanding the size of the solar energy collection system. Doing so reduces the need for hot water or space heating, for example, and typically provides the best economic return on the total investment, including the solar energy system.

He was educated by his father, and became known as a proficient Talmudist. He married at an early age, and settled with his wife's parents in the village of Streszyn, commonly called Strashun (near Wilna), and assumed the latter name. The distillery owned by his father-in-law was wrecked by the invading French army in 1812, and the family removed to Wilna, where Samuel established another distillery and became one of the most prominent members of the community. His wife conducted the business, as was usual in Wilna, and he devoted the greater part of his time to studying the Talmud and to teaching, gratuitously, the disciples who gathered about him. The Talmud lectures which for many years he delivered daily at the synagogue on Poplaves street were well attended, and from the discussions held there resulted his annotations, which are now incorporated in every recent edition of the Babylonian Talmud (Hagahot v'Chiddushei HaRashash). His fame as a rabbinical scholar spread throughout Russia, and he conducted a correspondence with several well-known rabbis. Strashun was offered the rabbinate of Suwa≈Çki, but he refused it, preferring to retain his independence. His piety did not prevent him from sympathizing with the progressive element in Russian Jewry, and he was one of the few Orthodox leaders who accepted in good faith the decree of the government that only graduates of the rabbinical schools of Wilna and Jitomir should be elected as rabbis. He wrote Hebrew well, spoke Polish fluently, was conspicuously kind and benevolent, and was highly esteemed even among the Christian inhabitants of Wilna. He was greatly respected for his many public activities and his devotion to the Jewish community. Also a wealthy man, he established and managed an interest-free loan fund for the people of Wilna. Besides the above-mentioned annotations, he wrote others to the Midrash Rabbot, which first appeared in the Wilna editions of 1843-45 and 1855. Some of his novell√¶, emendations, etc., were incorporated in the works of other authorities. He died in Wilna on March 21, 1872.

The boats are made by Sama-Bajau, Tausug and Yakan peoples living in the Sulu Archipelago, Zamboanga peninsula, and southern Mindanao. Vinta are characterized by their colorful rectangular lug sails (bukay) and bifurcated prows and sterns, which resemble the gaping mouth of a crocodile. Vinta are used as fishing vessels, cargo ships, and houseboats. Smaller undecorated versions of the vinta used for fishing are known as tondaan. The name \\"vinta\\" is predominantly used in Zamboanga, Basilan, and other parts of mainland Mindanao. It is also known as pilang or pelang among the Sama-Bajau of the Tawi-Tawi islands; dapang or depang among the Tausug in Sulu; and balanda or binta in Yakan in Basilan. It can also be generically referred to as lepa-lepa, sakayan, or bangka, which are native names for small outrigger vessels. Description Detail of okil carvings on a vinta stern (c.1920) The vinta has a deep and narrow hull formed from a U-shaped dugout keel (baran) built up with five planks on each side. It is usually around in length. The most distinctive feature of the vinta hull is the prow, which is carved in the likeness of the gaping mouth of a crocodile (buaya). It is composed of two parts, the lower part is known as saplun, while the flaring upper part is known as palansar, both are usually elaborately carved with okil motifs. The stern has two upper extensions (the sangpad- sangpad) which either emerge from the back in a V-shape, or are separated by a space in the middle. The stern may or may not feature okil carvings like the prow. Vinta hulls are traditionally made from red lawaan wood; while the dowels, ribs, and sometimes parts of the outrigger are made from bakawan (mangrove) wood. Moro vinta (tondaan) from the Philippines (c. 1905) showing the bifurcated stern The hull is covered by a removable deck made of planks or split bamboo. It has a central house-like structure known as the palau. This is used as a living space especially for vinta which are used as houseboats by the Sama-Bajau. The palau can be taken down to convert the houseboat into a sailing boat. However, this is usually only done when absolutely necessary for vinta which function as houseboats. When traveling, vinta are usually paddled or poled in shallow and calm coastal waters, with frequent stops along the way for supplies. They only sail when crossing seas between islands in a hurry. Vinta have two bamboo outrigger floats (katig) which are supported by booms (batangan). Large boats can have as many as four batangan for each outrigger. The floats are slightly diagonal, with the front tips wider apart than the rear tips. The front tips of the floats also extend past the prow and curve upwards, while the rear tips do not extend beyond the stern. Additional booms (sa'am) also extend out from the hull and the main booms. These provide support for a covering of planks (lantay) which serve as extensions of the deck. Vinta are usually rigged with a rectangular lug sail locally known as bukay, on a biped mast slotted near the front section. These are traditionally decorated with colorful vertical strips of the traditional Sama-Bajau colors of red, blue, green, yellow, and white. The patterns and colors used are usually specific to a particular family or clan. Smaller sailing versions of the vinta used for fishing are known as \\"tondaan.\\" They are usually undecorated and lack the upper prow and stern attachments. They are rigged with a mast and a sail at all times, though a temporary palau can be erected amidships if necessary. Modern vinta are usually tondaan instead of the larger houseboats. Like other traditional boats in the Philippines since the 1970s, they are almost always motorized and have largely lost their sails. Along with the balangay, lightly armed vinta were also used in the civilian squadrons of the Marina Sutil (\\"Light Navy\\") of Zamboanga City and Spanish- controlled settlements in Mindanao and the Visayas in the late 18th to early 19th centuries, as defense fleets against Moro Raiders. Carvings Vinta are usually carved with okil designs, similar to the lepa and djenging boats of the Sama people. The three most common motifs are dauan-dauan (leaf-like designs), kaloon (curved lines), and agta-agta (fish designs). All three are used in carving the buaya design of the prow. The hull of the vinta is decorated with one to three strips of curvilinear carvings known as bahan- bahan (meaning \\"bending\\" or \\"curving\\"), which are reminiscent of waves. In new boats, these designs can be painted with the same colors as the sails, but once the paint wears off, it is usually not repainted. Reconstructions In 1985 the vinta Sarimanok was sailed from Bali to Madagascar to replicate ancient seafaring techniques. Zamboanga City also celebrates vintas in the annual Regatta de Zamboanga during the city's Zamboanga Hermosa Festival each October. The participants are usually Sama-Bajau fishermen from the coastal areas of Zamboanga. Many of these modern \\"vinta\\" however, are not vinta, but are other types of bangka (like bigiw) that merely use a vinta‚Äëpatterned sail (often non-functional). Other uses \\"Vinta\\" is also the name of a Moro dance that commemorates the migration of Filipinos into the archipelago. In the dance, dancers imitating the movements of the vinta (vessel) by balancing perilously on top of poles. PAREF schools in the Philippines have adopted the vinta as their symbol.

When in 1895 the seventh lodge was founded, a \\"Scandinavian Section\\" of the TS Adyar with headquarters in Stockholm was established. It was a practice that after seven lodges were founded in one country, a \\"Section\\" in that country could be founded. In 1907 the Finnish Section was founded, and in 1921 the Icelandic Section.The Theosophical Society - Adyar International Directory In the 1970s the members of the lodges of the Danish Section began to study the works of Alice Bailey. The TS Adyar was opposed to the teachings of Bailey, and this situation led to a crisis, so that the Danish Section left the TS Adyar in 1989 and became independent.Theosophical Association Scandinavia Another angle is perhaps the fact that the autobiography by Alice A. Bailey: \\"The Unfinished Autobiography,\\" written 1945-1948, and published 1951, is very much in opposition to the Theosophical Society and was viewed by TS Adyar as attacking the TS Adyar.Bailey, Alice A. (1951) \\"The Unfinished Autobiography,\\" written 1945-1948, p. 157-158, p. 169-172, p. 216, and p. 246. Alice A. Bailey was a member of the TS Adyar until year 1939 when she herself stopped her membership, says the TS Adyar archives in USA.Membership records. Theosophical Society in America Archives.  Independent organisations  The Danish TS voted in August 1989 for the creation of an independent Teosofisk Forening (Theosophical Union). Other lodges were integrated in this organisation. In November 1997 the name was changed to Theosophical Association Scandinavia (TAS). In August 2004 ten theosophical organisations from Denmark and Norway founded in Aarhus the Teosofisk Netv√¶rk or Teosofisk Nettverk (Theosophical Network). Members of the Theosophical Network are: *In Denmark: ** The Golden Circle - Den Gyldne Cirkel) (on Seeland ** Theosophical Association Aalborg - Teosofisk Forening Aalborg) ** Theosophical Association Aarhus - Teosofisk Forening √Örhus) ** Theosophical Association Frederikshavn - Teosofisk Forening Frederikshavn ** Theosophical Association Fyn - Teosofisk Forening Fyn ** Theosophical Association Copenhagen - Teosofisk Forening K√∏benhavn ** Theosophical Association Naestved - Teosofisk Forening N√¶stved *In Norway: ** Theosophical Association Stavanger - Teosofisk Forening Stavanger ** Theosophical Association Telemark/Vestfold - Teosofisk Forening Telemark/Vestfold ** Theosophical Center Oslo - Teosofisk Senter Oslo There are also other theosophical organisations in Scandinavia that are not part of the Network. Some members of independent theosophical organisations in Scandinavia also participated in the World Parliament of Religions in Barcelona in 2004. The TS Adyar has lodges in Finland, Sweden and Norway, and the TS Pasadena has lodges in Finland and Sweden. The ULT has lodges in Sweden.

He was Postmaster of the Fourth Class Post Office in Kisatchie, Louisiana, from 1887 to 1891.3 He was known by \\"A.R.\\" for most of his life. Biography He was the son of Hugh Dowden8, who was born in Fayette, Jefferson County, Mississippi Territory2 to a family of early pioneers, probably from Pennsylvania. Abraham Dowden married1 Louisa Ann Dendy (1840-19349) in Kisatchie, Louisiana1 on December 23, 18561. He was 17 years old, she was 16. Conducting the ceremony was Rev. Edmund Duggan1 of Many, LA.1 The first child of A.R. and Louisa, known only as \\"Son\\" Dowden, was born in and died in 1858. Usually, in that area, children buried unnamed had been stillborn or died at childbirth. The second son, Francis Marion (later \\"Bridge\\") Dowden was born September 6, 1860. The third son. Thomas Jefferson Dowden, was born February 14, 1862. These and subsequent children were all born in Kisatchie. LA. He enlisted in Co. E1, Sabine Guards4, 11th Louisiana Infantry1, on May 144, 18621 in Many, Louisiana4 during the American Civil War. He was a couple of weeks shy of his 24th birthday. An interesting fact is that A.R.'s May 14 enlistment date was a mere two weeks after the birth of his second son, Thomas Jefferson Dowden. One may wonder why he left his 22-year- old wife with an 18-month-old toddler and a two-week-old baby to enlist. Very probably, it was not because of loyalty to slavery, because neither he nor any of his family own any slaves. They were not that wealthy. Likely, as with most southern families at the time, service in the Confederate Army was more about protecting his homeland and family than slavery. Also possible, but less likely, is that A.R. was following the lead of his two older brothers, James Andrew Dowden (1837-1862) and Shelton Powell Dowden (1838-1862). James Andrew Dowden, the eldest brother, served in Co. H, later M, 12th Louisiana Infantry under Capt. B.D. Owens. He enlisted August 18, 1861, at Camp Moore, LA. (Other undocumented sources say he enlisted 26 Jul 1861.) The unit was sent by rail to Union City, Tennessee and from there marched to Columbus, KY on Sept. 3, 1861. They remained there six months in the construction of earthworks and obstructions along the Mississippi River. They were transferred to Island No (source illegible) in March, 1862, after the fall of Ft. Danetson made their position untenable. After two weeks, the regiment sent on garrison duty at Ft. Pillow, Tennessee, for three months. James Andrew died at Ft. Pillow, TN May 6, 1862, exactly two years after his marriage to Narcissa Amarylla Davis (1841-1862). Likely, he died from typhoid fever, as the 12th was hit severely by typhoid during its sojourn at Ft. Pillow. Shelton Powell Dowden, the second-oldest of Hugh Dowden's five sons, was a bachelor all his life. He was listed6 as a 20-year-old farm laborer6 in the household of Elijah and Louisa A Self6 prior to his enlistment in Company C, 12th Louisiana Infantry. Shelton never returned from the war. He was presumed killed in action. The Muster Roll of his unit states that he was \\"absent at hospital since Sept. 25, 1862\\" in Bolivar, TN.7 A.R.'s 11th Louisiana Regiment was combined with the 16th Louisiana Infantry and the Crescent Regiment to form the Consolidated Crescent Regiment on November 3, 1863, in Simmesport, Louisiana. Dowden rose to the rank of sergeant during the war. The Consolidated Crescent Regiment was heavily involved in contesting Union General Nathaniel Banks' Red River Campaign. At the Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana, on April 8, 1864, the unit took more than 175 casualties and was the only Louisiana unit to lose all three field officers in a single battle. Among the casualties were Dowden's brother-in-law, Corporal Thomas J. Dendy, who was killed, and his brother, Sergeant Stephen Grant Dowden, who was wounded. The Consolidated Crescent Regiment surrendered with the Confederate Army of the Trans-Mississippi on May 26, 1865. Dowden was paroled on June 8, 1865, and returned home to Natchitoches Parish. He became active in local politics later in life, and was serving on the Natchitoches Parish Police Jury at the time of his death. His death was reportedly due to \\"rheumatism and kidney Trouble.\\"1 References # \\"Widow's Application for Persion\\" for Louisa A.

Its first root is Spanish and Italian and used as a nickname for Carmel and Carmelo (respectively), from Hebrew karmel, \\"God's vineyard\\"., which is the name of a mountain range in northern Israel. The second origin is from Latin carmen, which means \\"ode\\" or \\"poem\\" (\\"Patrium Carmen\\": ode to the fatherland) and is also the root of the English word \\"charm\\". The name of the Roman goddess Carmenta based on this root comes from the purely Latin origin, as is the fragment of archaic Latin known as \\"Carmen Saliare\\". In English, the name is unisex; in Spanish, Romanian, and Portuguese it is generally female, though in Italian it is frequently male.  Spanish name  As a Spanish given name, it is usually part of the devotional compound names Mar√≠a del Carmen, Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen (Our Lady of Carmen), or Virgen del Carmen (in English, Our Lady of Mount Carmel), stemming from the tradition of the vision of Mary, mother of Jesus on 16 July 1251 by Simon Stock, head of the Carmelite order.

The first written record of the town is from 1217 but Csorv√°s became an independent settlement in 1857. The town has a symmetrical lay-out and has been rebuilt three times during its history. During the excavations, archeologists found church ruins from the age of the √Årp√°ds. The development of the town is founded on the talent and diligence of its Hungarian, Slovak and Romanian inhabitants. At the time, agriculture was the primary industry and the settlement‚Äôs output was predominantly wheat, maize and pig and cattle breeding. With the arrival of the Nagyv√°rad-Fiume railway line in 1871, Csorv√°s became the main transport centre for agricultural produce. By 1970, Csorv√°s was a large village with sufficiently developed infrastructure and canalization to ensure water and natural gas were readily available to inhabitants of the whole area. The town contains the ‚ÄúUnified Social Home‚Äù, a full scale specialized service for the old and infirm. Subsidized housing for the towns‚Äô young people is also available. Csorv√°s now has a modern developed town centre, as well as three churches and a chapel around Szabads√°g Square. The town also contains a big park decorated with pieces of fine art. The outskirts of the town are designated ‚Äúgreenbelt‚Äù areas where the ‚ÄúTransylvanian H√©rics‚Äù (a protected flower) thrives. Visitors are more than welcome to our festivals.

History Havertys was founded by James Joseph (J.J.) Haverty and his brother Michael in 1885. The first store was located at 14 East Hunter Street (now 117 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) in Atlanta, Georgia. By the third year, the new company moved to a larger location. In 1889, J.J. and Michael entered a partnership with the owner of a neighboring furniture store, Amos G. Rhodes, forming the Rhodes-Haverty Furniture Company. A year and a half after the first Rhodes-Haverty store opened, J.J. Haverty moved westward to St. Louis, Missouri with his family to expand, and soon after bought interest in a number of smaller showrooms. It wasn't until 1894 that J.J. returned his family back to Atlanta and went on the road to open more stores. By 1908, 17 stores were open and thriving. J.J. Haverty's son Clarence, who first began in the business by sweeping floors, rose to a leadership position and wished for a larger role in the business. The partnership with Rhodes was dissolved amicably and, with the flip of a coin, 16 of the stores were divided between Rhodes and Haverty. The main Atlanta location was purchased outright by J.J. Haverty and the business took back its original name of Haverty Furniture Company. Following the split with Rhodes, the company expanded across the South. The Atlanta headquarters outgrew their facility and moved to a larger six-story building in 1924. Also during this period, J.J. Haverty and Amos Rhodes formed another partnership, this time to erect the Rhodes-Haverty Building, which would remain Atlanta's tallest structure until 1954.The City of Atlanta. \\"Rhodes-Haverty Building\\" Retrieved December 6, 2010. In the late 1920s, the company took advantage of the booming stock market and went public. The stock sale took place on October 1, 1929. Four weeks later, the market crashed. Havertys' strong financial positions enabled the company to weather the difficult years ahead. Clarence Haverty, who had run the business for many years, was officially named president in 1938, at which time his father J.J. became chairman of the board. In October 1939, just short of his 81st birthday, founder J.J. Haverty died. In December 1941, the United States entered World War II and the company faced hard times brought on by the rationing of furniture production materials. When the war ended, pent-up demand for consumer goods caused sales to surge. The company seized the opportunity to remodel older stores and open new locations. Clarence Haverty's son, Rawson, returned from war and assumed the position of Corporate Secretary. The company continued to prosper during the 1950s. By 1955, there were 38 stores across ten states. Clarence Haverty decided to step down as president and Rawson took on the role. By 1960, the year of the company's 75th anniversary, Havertys added four more locations. That year also saw the passing of Clarence Haverty at the age of 79. By the end of the 1960s, retail trends were changing and downtown stores were replaced by stores closer to the growing suburban populations. Rawson Haverty led the company through this transition as president and Chief Executive Officer until 1984, when he was elected as chairman of the board. Another one of the founder's grandsons, Frank McGaughey, Jr., who had been with the company since 1947, accepted the title of president. In the late 1980s, Havertys embarked upon a comprehensive revitalization program, upgrading most of the company's stores. Enhanced lighting and display areas were the primary improvements, with some stores also expanding in size. The revitalization included closing the last downtown Atlanta store. Havertys remained the area's largest furniture retailer, with locations distributed throughout the metropolitan area. Frank McGaughey, Jr. added CEO to his title in addition to president in 1990. He held this post until his retirement in 1994, when John E. Slater was named president and CEO. Slater joined the company in 1956 and had spent his entire career with Havertys. In August 1998, the company's stock listing moved from the NASDAQ Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange.New York Stock Exchange. \\"Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. profile\\" Retrieved December 6, 2010. As Havertys witnessed the turn of another century, the company underwent many changes.

Progress continued and 100 stores were in business by the beginning of 2001, when the furniture retailer saw another change in leadership. Rawson Haverty retired from the board and took the title chairman emeritus. Grandson of J.J. Haverty, Clarence (Clancy) H. Ridley, elected to the board of directors in 1979, took Rawson's place as chairman of the board. Clancy provided continuity and guidance when J.J.'s great grandson Clarence H.

It covers an area of and has a population of 2889 people (2010). The surrounding area, Bugac puszta is the largest of seven disjoint units making up the Kiskuns√°g National Park. History Bugac was founded by the local government of Kecskemet, led by Kada Elek in 1909. Originally it belonged to Kecskem√©t province in the 19th century. The Book of Dede Korkut, where the most famous among the epic stories of the Oghuz Turks are collected, mentions Bughachuk, which in Turkic languages is also spelled 'Buƒüac'. Therefore, many people tend to believe that these two proper names are correlated. The Great Kurult√°j (tribal assembly of the Hun ‚Äì Turkic nations, celebration of the preservation of the ancient traditions) is usually hosted in this small town every 2 years.Information Countryside Although Bugac is a part of the Great Plains it is known to have a few features distinct from the plains. Sand hills, created by strong winds, cover several square kilometers of the region, resulting in a unique landscape around the village. These hills range from 10 meters to 50 meters in height. Lack of vegetation due to the poor quality of the soil in this region caused sand hills, which continually shifted and flew with the winds. In the eighteenth century, Maria Theresa decided to stop the sand winds by afforestation. Bugac is now surrounded by forests which cover the sand hills around the countryside. This unique land form is different from the Hortob√°gy National Park. Bugac is the part of the Kiskunsagi National Park which is the second national park of Hungary, founded in 1975. The first national park was of the Hortob√°gy National Park in 1973.

The Fund for Peace maintains programs in Nigeria, Uganda, Liberia, and works with private business in conflict zones to better secure the interests of businesses, local populations, and their governments. History The Fund for Peace was founded in 1957 by Randolph Compton. The organization was created in the memory of Randolph Compton's youngest son, John Parker Compton, who was killed in World War II. At a young age, John Parker wrote an essay, discussing the effects of war and the need for human civilization to embrace other methods of conflict resolution. After John Parker's death, Compton created the Fund for Peace, an organization based on the ideals of justice, environment, peace, and population.Fund for Peace \\"History\\" . Significant programs =The Fragile States Index= The Fragile States Index assesses the pressures experienced by nations based on social, economic, and political indicators such as demographic pressures, refugee flows, uneven economic development or severe economic decline, and human rights, among others. The \\"Failed States Index\\" debuted in 2005 with a limited assessment of approximately 75 countries; this was expanded to 146 countries in 2006, and then to 177 countries the following year. South Sudan was added to the assessment in 2011. In 2014, The Fund for Peace announced that the ranking would be renamed \\"Fragile States Index\\", claiming that the controversial term 'failed' had \\"[become] a distraction away from the point of the Index, which is to encourage discussions that support an increase in human security and improved livelihoods.\\" The Fragile States Index uses color-coded maps, tables, and a four level-ranking system (\\"Alert,\\" \\"Warning,\\" \\"Moderate,\\" \\"Sustainable\\") to determine the current conditions and negative potential in the future. All four nations on high \\"Alert\\" are a part of the African continent: Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the \\"Warning\\" level were many Latin American or former Soviet nations, including Moldova, Russia, Belarus, Colombia, Bolivia, and Mexico. At \\"Moderate\\" were the United States and several European states, such as Latvia, Poland, Italy, and Spain. Only a few nations, such as the Scandinavian countries, Iceland, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were rated as \\"Sustainable.\\" The Fragile States Index is subject to criticism, in part, because it takes institutions and data to draw its conclusions, as opposed to the Human Development Index or other more telling signs.

FFP conducts workshops in the conflict-affected countries of Liberia, Uganda, and Nigeria, training local participants in the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST). They train others at the community level. Data collected from field reports by the participants are analyzed for signs of early-warning conflict. The aggregate data is privately disseminated back to the participants and used to resolve disputes, identify priority issues at the community level, and as a way to obtain more immediate early warning and conflict prevention information. While the recent elections in Nigeria were widely recognized as a major step forward in the difficult journey toward democracy, UNLocK Nigeria provided a ground-level view of challenges that remained, including incidents of ballot box snatching, vote-buying, abductions, and violence.

It partners with regional and sub regional organizations like NATO, the EU, and the African Union. The Center for the Study of Threat Convergence is funded by the MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Ploughshares Fund. =Business and FFP= Created in 1997, the Human Rights and Business Roundtable brings together businesses and human rights organizations to ensure compliance with international standards, particularly in regard to the conduct of security forces in and around industrial operations. It recognizes the challenges faced, particularly in the extractive industries, in balancing human rights and security. FFP works with various private companies in the oil, mining, agribusiness, renewable energy, and infrastructure sectors in both stable and conflict zones around the world. The Sustainable Development & Security program supports companies in their development of human rights and security policies, conflict and human rights assessments, community relations and stakeholder engagement, and monitoring and reporting mechanisms. FFP is a long-standing civil society participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security & Human Rights initiative, and currently serves on the initiative's Steering Committee and Board of Directors. =CAST= For conflict assessment, the Fund for Peace utilizes the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST). CAST was created in 1996 as a system of locating and analyzing potential conflicts in failed states. It works by incorporating \\"theoretical rationale, a conceptual framework, quantitative and qualitative indicators...and a rating system for trend analysis. \\" However, CAST may be criticized for putting too much emphasis on technology and equations, and not enough on the human analysis.Moore, Jennifer \\"From Nation State to Failed State\\", Columbia Human Rights Law Review, 1999. Furthermore, CAST is a tool that remains static, despite the specific conflict at hand. Each case is unique, and CAST does not have the mathematical ability to assess the uniqueness and specific needs of varying failed states. , The Fund for Peace, CAST. FFP maintains relationships with the United States Marine Corps and the South Korean government, among others. Past programs =Genocide prevention= As the Fund for Peace works in regions prone to genocide, the organization developed a relationship with the Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide.United Nations \\"Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Mission Statement\\" UN Official Website. The Special Adviser played a role in researching and delivering information to aid the Special Adviser in his responsibilities. The Special Adviser and the Fund for Peace were involved in researching human rights violations, sharing information and giving warnings to the Secretary General and the Security Council on matters of genocide, and making recommendations on courses of action. , The Fund for Peace, Genocide Prevention. =Peace and Stability Operations Project= Originally called the Regional Responses to Internal War Project, the program looks to shed light on regional organizations and their \\"political will\\" to maintain peaceful relations. The Peace and Stability Operations Project also serves to form relationships with actors in other sectors, such as scholars, research institutions, journalists, and experts. The Fund for Peace believes that, through these extended relationships, the international community can work together to maintain peace in typically violent areas. The Fund for Peace has been successful in advancing the international dialogue on peacekeeping by holding public meetings with international representatives, performing research missions in over thirty- five countries, and holding workshops. By collaborating with actors in other sectors, the Fund for Peace is able to gather the ideas and opinions of other experts and publish them in their issues of Reality Check: Diverse Voices on Internal Conflict. , The Fund for Peace, Peace and Stability Operations Project. =United States foreign policy= The second initiative is the Use and Purpose of American Power. The goal of this initiative is to promote ongoing dialogue and debate on the role of the United States in the international arena. It does so by asking four questions: * What are our interests and values as we act in the world? * What are the specific goals we should set and the things we should do? * What tools do we use to achieve these? * How as Americans do we influence events as they so obviously affect us? , the Fund for Peace, Use and Purpose of American Power. The Use and Purpose of American Power also has three main components. The first is the National Dialogue forums. In 2008 and 2009, the Fund for Peace partnered up with local organizations, such as chambers of commerce and universities, across the country and organized \\"'traveling town halls.'\\" The purpose of these were to discuss topics relating to the presidential election, and the condition of the United States and its population. The format of the forums were designed to encourage participation and dialogue on behalf of Americans to actively and critically think about their role, their country's condition, and the government's responsibility. Throughout two years, the National Dialogue forums took place in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Mexico, Alabama, Idaho, Florida, and California. , The Fund for Peace, National Dialogue Forums. The second component is the American Conversation. While the National Dialogue forums were designed to spark interest and discussion, the purpose of the American Conversation is an online discussion hosted by Google Groups to continue conversations that began at the National Dialogue forums. The American Conversation is an effort by the Fund for Peace to encourage ongoing critical thinking in the minds of Americans and their communities. , The Fund for Peace, American Conversation. The third component of the Use and Purpose of American Power is the Final Report. The Final Report is a summary of the National Dialogue forums and the ideas and concepts presented at the forums. The Final Report, titled The Use and Purpose of American Power in the 21st Century highlights five main points: * \\"Economic security is vital to American national security; but America‚Äôs structural economic problems prevent it from operating from a position of strength in the world.\\" * \\"National leaders should first ‚Äòtake care of their own‚Äô because of the gravity of the economic challenges; however, America‚Äôs welfare is also closely tied to the world economy.\\" * \\"Nation-building and democracy-building projects are a mission impossible; still, the U.S. should promote good governance, human rights, and equitable development.\\" * \\"Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are lesser threats than America‚Äôs economic problems.\\" * \\"U.S. leaders‚Äô inability to adapt to new global realities poses the greatest challenge to America‚Äôs standing in the world.\\" , The Fund for Peace, Final Report. The Fund for Peace's efforts in United States foreign policy is based on the fear of \\"spillover\\" and the influence and multiplication of failed states.Mallaby, Sebastian \\"The Reluctant Imperialist\\", Foreign Affairs, 2002. The National Dialogue forums were sponsored by the Fund for Peace. The Final Report was funded by the Ford Foundation. , The Fund for Peace, Funding. =Human rights= Another initiative to promote human rights is the Globalization and Human Rights Series. This consists of publications dedicated to discussing pertinent topics relating to human rights, the impact of failing states, and corruption. Four issues have been published since 2005 in an effort to continue to educate the industries and the public on the harmful effects of failing governments, and the need for the recognition of, and commitment to, human rights. , The Fund for Peace, Globalization and Human Rights Series. Furthermore, the Fund for Peace is a supporter of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, which guides businesses who voluntarily participate on how to align their security practices with human rights considerations.\\"Voluntary Principles\\" The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. The Voluntary Principles are important because of the potentially harmful impacts security practices can have when operating in a failed state or conflict zone, but also because the international community is putting increasing emphasis on the rights of individuals. , The Fund for Peace, Civil Society and Human Rights. Other collaboration The Fund for Peace does not limit its partnerships to select sectors. The organization has collaborated with Georgetown University's Center for Peace and Security Studies and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Together, the three institutions developed a thesis on the increased participation of regional organizations and their member states in promoting peacekeeping. , The Fund for Peace, Peace Operations: Trends, Progress, and Prospects The Fund for Peace partnered with the Centre for International Governance Innovation in 2007. From September 4‚Äì6, thirty participants from varying Middle Eastern countries, as well as Australia, the United States, and Canada, met in Istanbul, Turkey. The participants came from academia, international organizations, the Arab League, the United Nations, governments, and human rights organizations. The representatives were faced with the task of determining what steps should be taken to efficiently protect civilians. The conference promoted a sense of international unity by asking the representatives to leave aside their political ideologies and keep the welfare of human beings as their priority. The conference ended with the unanimous support of International Humanitarian Law and the Bosphorous Consensus. , The Fund for Peace, the Middle East. The Fund for Peace has also partnered with Logos Technologies, the United States Institute of Peace, the United States Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute, the U.S. State Department Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to create a metrics framework for peacekeeping. The project includes concepts from the book The Quest for Viable Peace with the theoretical approach of the Fund for Peace's CAST methodology. The organizations involved are interested in helping governments determine the outcome of Stabilization and Reconstruction Operations. , The Fund for Peace, Metrics for Stability.

She was a recipient of a 1984 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Early life Margaret was the daughter of Sara Fina (sometimes spelled Serafina) Guiterrez Tafoya (1863‚Äì1949) and Jose Geronimo Tafoya (1863‚Äì1955). She attended the Santa Clara Pueblo elementary school, and then the Santa Fe Indian School from 1915 to 1918. She had to drop out of high school to help her family during the flu pandemic of 1918. Margaret learned the art of making pottery from her parents, and was particularly influenced by her mother. Sara Fina was considered the leading potter of Santa Clara in her day, as the master of making exceptionally large, finely polished blackware. She also occasionally made redware, micaceous clay storage jars and other smaller utilitarian forms. Margaret's father was primarily concerned with raising food for the family but he was also known to make pottery and helped Sara Fina with many aspects of her pottery production. As a child, Tafoya started making small animals out of the clay that her parents had extracted from the Santa Clara land for Sara Fina's works. Showing promise, her mother encouraged young Margaret to make her own pottery and taught her how to knead the clay and polish shaped pots, as well as where to gather fuel for the firing process. Sara Fina allowed Margaret to sell her first pottery to a dealer in Santa Fe, although Margaret did not recall how much money she made that day. But the act of selling her work gave her confidence to continue making pottery. Career For several years, Margaret worked as a cook and a waitress before she married Alcario Tafoya (1900‚Äì1995) in 1924. Alcario, a distant relative with the same last name, and Margaret worked together making pottery just as her mother and father had done. Margaret and Sara Fina's husbands both helped with the tasks of digging and preparing the clay and the firing of the pots. Alcario also helped Margaret with the creation and carving of designs on her pots. Early in her career, Margaret often traded pottery for children's clothing or other household necessities to support her growing family. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Tafoyas would frequently load Margaret's pots into a horse-drawn wagon and travel hundreds of miles to Santa Fe and Taos to sell the works to tourists and traders. Tafoya also began selling her works at Indian art fairs such as the Santa Fe Indian Market and the Inter-Tribal Ceremonial at Gallup. In the 1950s, as interest in Native American art grew, the public would travel to the pueblos as tourists as well as to buy artistic goods, so the family didn't have to travel as far to sell their wares. During this time period, the Tafoyas befriended the owner of a resort in Royal Gorge, Colorado who hired them for summer residencies to perform ceremonial dances and sell their pottery to guests. By the 1960s Margaret's pottery had become famous, particularly her large black jars. Margaret continued her mother's tradition of making these exceptionally large pots, with finely polished surfaces and simple carved designs. \\"Measuring as high as three feet, these vessels took months to mold and polish. They also required an enormous amount of technical skill, particularly to keep them from breaking while being fired\\". The labor- intensive techniques meant that Tafoya usually made only one large pot per year. Her \\"bear paw\\" motif and deeply carved pueblo symbols like the Avanyu (water serpent) and kiva steps around the shoulder of her jars have become signature trademarks of the Tafoya family pottery. Like her mother, Margaret molded her pots using the traditional coiling method. \\"This method and many of the techniques used in the production of her pottery has been dated as being as more than 1200 years old, with the ancient \\"Anasazi\\" of the Colorado Plateau being the founding culture. A common misconception was the belief that black on black, burnished pueblo pottery had \\"died out,\\" according to Larry Frank and Francis H. Harlow. \\"In reality, the nearby inhabitants of Santa Clara Pueblo were still producing the highly burnished, black on black pottery, since the 1600s, therefore lending to the revival of the San Ildefonso style of black on black \\"painted\\" pottery. The only difference between the two pueblo's styles is that in Santa Clara, pots are deeply carved and incised, whereas, in San Ildefonso, the pottery is generally not carved and painted with pigments to cause un-polished designs on a polished surface.\\" In the early 20th century, as Maria Martinez was developing the San Ildefonso style of traditional pottery, it was well known that she in fact learned various polishing (burnishing) techniques from Margaret Tafoya, as well as how to turn any color of clay black, by simply smothering the fire with manure.(R.

The comet was observed to have broken up by 1846; further drift of the pieces by 1852 suggested the moment of breakup was in either 1842 or early 1843, when the comet was near Jupiter. The breakup led to particularly spectacular showers in subsequent cycles (particularly in 1872 and 1885). In the early 19th century, before the break-up of comet 3D/Biela, the radiant was in Cassiopeia. In the last century the radiant of the modern weaker meteor shower is generally in the constellation of Andromeda as the name of the shower suggests, but due to its age and diffuseness meteors may appear to come from the neighbouring constellations, such as Pisces, Triangulum and Cassiopeia. Historical appearances The Andromedids of 27 November 1872, a product of the breakup of Biela's Comet several decades previously. The first known sighting of the Andromedids was December 6, 1741, over St Petersburg, Russia. Further strong showers were witnessed in 1798, 1825, 1830, 1838 and 1847. The Andromedids produced spectacular displays of several thousand meteors per hour in 1872 and 1885, as a result of Earth crossing the comet's debris stream. Schmidt, observing from Athens, said that the 1872 shower consisted mainly of faint (5th to 6th magnitude) meteors with \\"broad and smoke-like\\" trains and a predominantly orange or reddish colouration.American Journal of Science, Third Series, V (Jan-Jun 1873), 153 In England, Lowe estimated the same shower as producing at least 58,600 visible meteors between 5.50 and 10.30 pm, observed that the meteors were much slower than the Leonids, and noted noises \\"like very distant gun-shots\\" several times to the north-west.AJS, V, 152 In Burma, the 1885 shower was perceived as a fateful omen and was indeed followed swiftly by the collapse of the Konbaung dynasty and the conquest by Britain.Lonely Planet Myanmar, 10th edition page 256 The November 27, 1885, shower was the occasion of the first known photograph of a meteor, taken by Austro-Hungarian astronomer, Ladislaus Weinek, who caught a 7mm-long trail on a plate at his Prague observing station. Current activity Since the 19th century the Andromedids have faded so substantially that they are no longer generally visible to the naked eye, though some activity is still observable each year in mid-November given suitable detection equipment. In recent years, peak activity had been less than three meteors per hour, around November 9 to 14. Andromedid activity of November comes from the newest streams, while that of early December comes from the oldest. On December 4, 2011, six Canadian radar stations detected 50 meteors in an hour. The activity was likely from the 1649 stream. On December 8, 2013, Meteor specialist Peter Brown reported that the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar had recorded an outburst from the Andromedid meteors in the past 24 hours. Scientists postulate a somewhat weaker return in 2018, but a yield of up to 200 meteors an hour in 2023. Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) data also detected a spike of 30 meteors per hour on November 27, 2008. During the 2012 shower an inconspicuous maximum occurred on November 9.

He was born on 15 April 1750 in Chachapoyas, his hometown, when Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco, count of Superunda, was governing the Viceroyalty of Peru. He was of the most illustrious precursors of the national independence. He was a priest, a professor and a tribune. He formed a new patriots' generation in the revolutionary ideas. When the Republic was born, the sower of renewing ideals was next to his disciples, sharing the responsibilities of the first Peruvian Constituent Congress. During that time, Chachapoyas was a district of the Bishopric of Trujillo. In this city, which the main political and intellectual institutions of the region were centralized. Little Toribio, being still a child, was sent to this city, so he could go to the seminary. There he studied Latin and prepared himself to continue ecclesiastic studies of more importance in the Seminar Santo Toribio de Lima (Saint Toribio of Lima Seminar). He entered in this seminar with outstanding notes. He stands out as a brilliant student and in 1770 he obtains the degree of Doctor in Theology in the National University of San Marcos in Lima. He dies in 1825 knowing that Peru is \\"free and independent because of the general will of its people\\". The Professor Statue of Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza His interest in education run in his family. His parents, Santiago Rodr√≠guez and Josefa Collantes, had a wealthy position and they were owners of a noble house in the main square of Chachapoyas. They had taken an active part in the efforts so that this city was provided with a school. Toribio should have felt impressed by this wish of his parents during his childhood, since he gave a lot of samples of his tendency to education from his early years. Being still a student, he had begun working in the teaching field, revealing himself with a teacher's notable talent. His prestige as a professor had already grown when the viceroy Amat named him professor of the Real Convictorio de San Carlos in 1771. This convictorio was created to make up for the shortcoming that the expulsion of the Jesuits had left in education. In this center he takes the chairs of philosophy and theology. It is here where his educator's personality is defined. His talent opens him the doors of San Marcos, where they also deliver him a chair in 1773. During this time he ordained himself in four minor degrees and in 1778 he becomes a presbyter. The Presbyter He has to devote himself to the affairs of his ministry. Through a contest he wins the parish of Marcabal, an indigenous town placed in Huamachuco (La Libertad RegionLa Libertad). But the young priest is already incorporated into the intellectual elite of the epoch. A little time later, he is called again to Lima. He is entrusted with the vice-chancellor of the Convictorio Carolino and one year later, in 1786, the viceroy Teodoro de Croix makes him chancellor of this center of studies. Till then, Rodr√≠guez of Mendoza had been an eager and passionate reader of the philosophers whose thought was guided to Europe. And longing for introducing these advanced ideas in our environment, he carries out a spiritual, intellectual and material transformation. At the same time he re-build the building of the College, today University of San Marcos, he also puts into practice new education plans. But it is not easy. Conservatives and reactionists stick blindly to the old systems. The professor is one of the first people that see the transformation that will bring the independence of Peru coming. That's why he wants to form a leading class that has an authentic Peruvian feeling. The Tribune The house of Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza is conserved like a historical monument in his native city. He fights to impose the education in a common language, the study of natural sciences and to introduce professions that make the youth stand out in all the action fields. He supported the idea that it was necessary to give a profession to the young people who didn't want to choose the law court nor the altar. Despite his consecration to form a leading class, he also worries about the popular education, trusting that the language unit would be the way to achieve the equality of the Indian with the Creole and White people. In 1814, his disciples and friends found the Sociedad Filantr√≥pica (Philanthropic Society) to spread the American revolution with clear anti-monarchist tendency. But the enemies of the restructuring do not rest. The professor is already aged although it has not decreased the fire of the ideal in his spirit, that ideal that has been the north of his life. They make him the most ridiculous accusations. They call him volteriano, jansenista, luciferino, propagandist of prohibited ideas, etc. His conduct was investigated in a more or less covered up way. The economic situation of the College was more precarious every day and in such circumstances, he resigned to be the academic chancellor in 1815, but Abascal did not accept his resignation. His resignation was accepted later in 1817 by Viceroy Pezuela. At the arrival of the Expedici√≥n Libertadora (freedom expedition) of San Martin, his elder's illnesses did not prevent the old fighter to leave his retirement and to put himself to the orders of the liberating government. In this way he has the opportunity to take part in the birth of the Peruvian Republic as a member of the first Peruvian Constituent Congress. In the assembly, he is a valuable and correct guide. Calm and serene, he sails with steadfastness between the passions turmoil that was unleashed by the independence. But his health does not resist any more and he chooses to retire definitively. He lives enough to be glad for the victory of Ayacucho.

He was one of \\"the last arrivals,\\" and attended upon the Gaon as a disciple for less than a year. He gained the Vilna Gaon's confidence, and was chosen to arrange for publication the Gaon's commentary to the first two parts of the Shulchan Aruch. That on the Orach Chaim was published in Shklov in 1803. Ashkenazi also published his master's notes to the tractate Shekalim of the Jerusalem Talmud, with a commentary of his own, under the title Taklin Chadtin (Minsk, 1812). Later he emigrated to Ottoman Syria and became the head of the German and Polish congregations of Safed and then of Jerusalem. He was there surnamed \\"Ashkenazi\\" (the \\"German\\"), a name applied to all Jews of German extraction, in contradistinction to the Sephardim, who came originally from Spain or Portugal. After a residence of several years in the Holy Land, Ashkenazi went to Europe as a ShaDaR (emissary of the rabbis), to collect alms for the poor Palestinian Jews residing at the Yishuv haYashan, and in that capacity he traveled through Lithuania and other parts of Russia. On his return to Palestine he wrote his chief work, Pe'at ha-Shulchan, which is intended as a sort of supplement to the Shulchan Aruch, supplying all the agricultural laws obligatory only in the Holy Land, omitted by rabbi Joseph Caro in his code. He also incorporated in this book the notes of Elijah of Vilna (the Gaon) to the tractate Zera'im, the first order of the Mishnah, and gave in addition a voluminous commentary of his own which he called Beit Yisrael. The work was published in Safed in 1836 by the printing-house of Yisrael ben Avraham Back. Ashkenazi is also the author of Nachalah u-Menuchah, a collection of responsa mentioned in the work above. An account of his rabbinate of Jerusalem is given in Mendel ben Aaron's Kore ha-'Ittim (Vilna, 1840). Ashkenazi died at Tiberias on May 22, 1839.

Origins of the song The writing of the song is credited to Gene Vincent and his manager, Bill \\"Sheriff Tex\\" Davis. Evidently the song originated in 1955, when Vincent was recuperating from a motorcycle accident at the US Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. There, he met Donald Graves, who supposedly wrote the words to the song while Vincent wrote the tune. (Cf. \\"Money Honey\\" by the Drifters, 1953). The song came to the attention of Davis, who allegedly bought out Graves' rights to the song for some $50 (sources vary as to the exact amount), and had himself credited as the lyric writer. Davis claimed that he wrote the song with Gene Vincent after listening to the song \\"Don't Bring Lulu\\". Vincent himself sometimes claimed that he wrote the words inspired by the comic strip, \\"Little Lulu\\": \\"I come in dead drunk and stumble over the bed. And me and Don Graves were looking at this bloody book; it was called Little Lulu. And I said, \\"Hell, man, it's 'Be-Bop-a-Lulu.' And he said, 'Yeah, man, swinging.' And we wrote this song.\\" The phrase \\"Be-Bop-a-Lula\\" is similar to \\"Be-Baba-Leba\\", the title of a No. 3 R&B; chart hit for Helen Humes in 1945, which became a bigger hit when recorded by Lionel Hampton as \\"Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop.\\" This phrase, or something very similar, was widely used in jazz circles in the 1940s, giving its name to the bebop style, and possibly being ultimately derived from the shout of \\"Arriba! Arriba!\\" used by Latin American bandleaders to encourage band members.Peter Gammond, The Oxford Companion to Popular Music, 1991, Recording by Gene Vincent In early 1956, Gene Vincent performed the song on a radio show in Norfolk, Virginia, and recorded a demo version which was passed to Capitol Records, who were looking for a young singer to rival Elvis Presley. Capitol invited Vincent to record the song and it was recorded at Owen Bradley's studio in Nashville, Tennessee on May 4, 1956. Cliff Gallup (lead guitar), \\"Wee\\" Willie Williams (rhythm guitar), \\"Jumpin'\\" Jack Neal (string bass), and Dickie \\"Be Bop\\" Harrell (drums) comprised the band.Gene Vincent & The Blue Caps, \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" Retrieved April 7, 2012. When the song was being recorded, Harrell screamed twice in the background, he said because he wanted to be sure his family could hear it was him on the record. The song was released in June 1956 on Capitol Records' single F3450, and immediately sold well. The song was successful on three American singles charts: it peaked at No. 7 on the US Billboard pop music chart, No. 8 on the R&B; chart, and also made the top ten on the C&W; Best Seller chart peaking at No. 5. In the UK, it peaked at No. 16 in August 1956. In April 1957, the record company announced that over 2 million copies had been sold to date. The original demo for the song, probably recorded at radio station WCMS, has never been located and is presumed lost. The song drew comparisons to Presley Track 3. and is listed as No. 103 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Steve Allen mocked the lyrics to the song by reading them in a pseudo-serious tone accompanied by light piano background music in a September 1957 broadcast of The Steve Allen Show. Vincent recorded a new version of the song in 1962 which appeared on the flip-side of the single \\"The King of Fools\\". Vincent sang the song in the movie The Girl Can't Help It. Cover versions \\"Be-Bop-a-Lula\\" has been covered by numerous and varied artists. The Everly Brothers released a version only two years after Vincent's, on their 1958 self-titled debut album, and they included it as part of the setlist at their Royal Albert Hall reunion concert in 1983. English rocker Cliff Richard covered the song for his own debut album, Cliff, in 1959. Vincent's rockabilly colleague Jerry Lee Lewis recorded it for the 1971 album Monsters, and Carl Perkins offered his own take in 1996 on the album The Man & The Legend. The Beatles played the song regularly during their early years, and a raucous live version (complete with guest vocals) can be heard on Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962. John Lennon later recorded the song for his 1975 album Rock 'n' Roll, and it was used as the B-side for the Apple single release of \\"Ya Ya\\" in Germany later that year. Paul McCartney performed an acoustic version on the 1991 live album Unplugged (The Official Bootleg). The song has also been recorded by: *The 77s *Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs *Boney M. *Burton Cummings *David Cassidy *Demented Are Go *Foghat *Gene Summers *Orion *Queen *Raul Seixas *Stray Cats *Suicide In popular culture Vincent's original version of the song is featured in the soundtracks of several films including The Delinquents (1989), Wild At Heart (1990), and Pleasantville (1998). In the late 1960s and early '70s, George Harrison played a psychedelic Stratocaster called \\"Rocky\\", which bore on its face the one-word slogan \\"Bebopalula\\". The song is name-checked in the opening of Dire Straits' 1985 hit \\"Walk of Life\\" as one of the great \\"oldies, goldies\\". Italian DJ and TV personality Red Ronnie (a.k.a. Gabriele Anzaloni) named his first and long-running TV show after the song, also using Vincent's performance in the film The Girl Can't Help It as the signature tune of the show (accompanied by cartoonist Bonvi's Sturmtruppen-inspired animations). The song features in the soundtrack of Jack Smith's infamous avant-garde film, Flaming Creatures (1963). A cover version of the song by Chris Cawte appears in the animated film Planet 51.

He was the son of William Henry Purdon and Eliza Purdon (n√©e Tarr), who had come to the Cape Colony as children with the British 1820 Settlers. He married Dorothy Cockroft in 1863 and farmed between Grahamstown and Port Alfred. In 1865 he travelled to Grahamstown by ox-wagon; presumably this was a regular visit for supplies.

While sitting in the barber's chair, he noticed a row of pineapple crowns (tops) set on the brims of jars of water. These having roused his curiosity, Mr. Green informed him that they were from pineapples, sent to him as a gift. The fruit had been brought by ship to Durban by a sailor having returned from Brazil.

M. W. Turner the techniques of tinted drawingIan Warrell, in Robert Hewison et al., Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites, Tate Gallery Publishing, 2000, p. 13. and patronised the careers of Turner and of the landscape painter William Henry Hunt. The critic John Ruskin said in his \\"Notes\\" on Turner in March 1878, that ::\\"His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by Giston, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.\\" He established at his house in Bushey a school for artists and among those who spent time there were: Thomas Girtin, William Henry Hunt and J M W Turner. His own son Alexander was a talented watercolourist and his sketchbook can be seen in the Bushey Museum. Coincidentally, Monro's distant kinsman Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar would later be one of Turner's chief patrons.

It has been described as Walker's \\"meditation on the modern civil rights movement.\\" Meridian is about Meridian Hill, a young black woman in the late 1960s who is attending college as she embraces the civil rights movement at a time when the movement becomes violent. The story follows her life into the 1970s through a relationship that ultimately fails, and her continued efforts to support the movement. Plot summary Set in the 1960s and 1970s, Meridian centers on Meridian Hill, a student at the fictitious Saxon College, who becomes active in the Civil Rights Movement. She becomes romantically involved with another activist, Truman Held. They have a turbulent on-and-off relationship, during which she becomes pregnant by him. After Meridian has an abortion, Truman becomes far more attached to her and longs for them to start a life together. Later, Truman becomes involved with a white woman, Lynne Rabinowitz, who is also active in the Civil Rights struggle, though perhaps for the wrong reasons. As time passes, Truman attempts, unsuccessfully, to achieve personal and financial success while Meridian continues to stay involved in the movement and fight for issues she believes deeply in. Themes and critiques Walker wrote the novel at a time when many young black people were shifting away from supporting the practice of nonviolence and civil disobedience that had characterized the early years of the movement and had begun to take on more militant and extreme positions thereby alienating some supporters. Several literary critics believe that the novel is a critique of the Civil Rights Movement from that period. They interpreted Walker's work as suggesting that the revolution never addressed the suffering of women; rather it perpetuated destructive and often chauvinistic values. Some critics thought that Walker used Meridian to showcase her womanist (as opposed to feminist) attitudes. A strong believer in the inherent power of the woman, Walker depicts her title character as an innately tough and resolute person, though not one without problems. Walker argues that personal struggles are an unavoidable part of life. She believes this is how individuals overcome obstacles and, ultimately, define their characters. Meridian features earlier examples of strong female role models.

The vessel was found to be carrying 50 tons of weapons, including short-range Katyusha rockets, antitank missiles, and high explosives.  Background  Prior investigation has revealed that the captain of the vessel was Colonel Omar Akawi, a Fatah activist since 1976 and former member of the Palestinian Authority. According to the Lloyd's List, which tracks worldwide shipping records, the ship was purchased on 31 August 2001 from a Lebanese company by the Palestinian Authority, under the name of Adel Mughrabi. The alleged purchaser of the weapons, Adel Mughrabi (aka Adel Salameh) was a former member of Yassir Arafat's staff until the early 1980s \\"when he was dismissed for conducting private business which conflicted with his official status\\". From October 2000, Mughrabi was in contact with the Iranians and Hezbollah. Mughrabi was one of the key contacts in the Palestinian weapons obtaining system. He was supported by the Palestinian Naval Police Commander Juma'a Ghali and his executive Fathi Ghazem. Their objective was to sneak in a great amount of weapons for the use of the Palestinian Authority. This particular operation included the purchase and facilitating of ships, forming of a sailing crew, planning on how to store and hide the weapons, the loading of the weapons into the vessels, and the transit of it until delivered to the Palestinian Authority. The ship was then sailed to Sudan, where it was loaded with regular cargo and the crew was switched with Palestinian Authority personnel. It was renamed from Rim K to Karine A when it was registered in Tonga on September 12. Tonga has confirmed that Abbas was still the owner of the ship. During November 2001, they sailed to the Hodeida port in Yemen. Afterwards, the ship was loaded with weapons by the Iranians and the Hezbollah; while in transit, it was manned by personnel of the Palestinian Authority. The objective was to transport the weapons to the Palestinian Naval Police near the Gaza beaches. During December 2001, Mughrabi gave the ship detailed instructions to sail to the beaches of Qeshm Island, Iran. There a ferry approached it‚Äîmost likely from Iran. This ferry contained the weapons stored in 80 large wooden crates, which were transferred onto the ship. The personnel of the ship then placed these weapons in special waterproof containers‚Äîwhich were produced only in Iran. These containers are floatable and have a configurable system that determines how deep they are submerged. When the loading was completed the ship needed to alter its heading towards the Hodeida port, due to technical problems. After the ship crossed the canal it was expected to meet with three smaller ships and to transfer the load onto them‚Äîthese smaller ships were purchased in advance. They were then supposed to drop the weapons near El Arish, Egypt. The commander of the Palestinian Naval Police, Juma'a Ghali and his executive Fathi Ghazem, would then collect the weapons there.  Shipment  The ship itself was worth an estimated $400,000, the civilian cargo used to conceal the weapons approximately $3,000,000, and the weapons were estimated at a value of approximately $15,000,000. The shipment included the following weapons: *122 mm Katyusha rockets. *107 mm Katyusha rockets. *80 mm mortar shells. *120 mm mortar shells. *Anti-tank missiles. *Anti-tank mines. *Sniper rifles. *AK-47 (\\"Kalashnikov\\") assault rifles. *Ammunition. *Two and a half tons of high explosives. Ashkelon and other coastal cities would have been threatened by these Katyusha rockets if they reached Gaza. The Ben-Gurion International Airport and various major Israeli cities would have been within the range of these rockets if situated in the West Bank. The shipment also included rubber boats and diving equipment. This equipment could have facilitated seaborne attacks from Gaza against the coastal cities. Major General Yedidya Yaari, the commander of the Israeli Navy, reported that the weapons and equipment were packed in 83 crates, in waterproof plastic and attached to buoys, to permit their drop-off and retrieval at sea.  Interception  The mission began at 04:45 of 3 January 2002 in the Red Sea, from Israel. The ship was sailing in international waters on its way to the Suez Canal. Israeli Navy commandos, backed by combat helicopters and aircraft, surprised the crew and took over the vessel without firing a shot. The ship was taken to Eilat the night of January 4. Major General Shaul Mofaz, chief of staff of the Israeli Army, announced in a Tel Aviv news conference on January 4 that the army had seized the ship while General Anthony Zinni was meeting with Yasser Arafat to promote negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  Aftermath  Israel and the United States alleged Hezbollah had some link to the Palestinian weapons ship seized by Israel. Three Hezbollah members arrested in Jordan were attempting to smuggle Katyusha rockets to the Palestinians (the detainees were later freed by the Jordanians at the request of the Lebanese government). Another fishing vessel carrying weapons to the Palestinians was sunk off the Lebanese coast by Israel in May 2002. Israel charged that the weapons and military cargo were purchased with the help of Hezbollah. Hezbollah rejected accusations of involvement in arms shipment.Katyusha Rocket Global Security Israeli reports stated that the ship, purchased from Lebanon, had loaded weapons at the Iranian island of Kish in the middle of the night off the coast of Iran. It had then sailed through the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Red Sea. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat denied any involvement. While the IDF maintains that the weapons were bound for the PA, other sources have suggested that the weapons may instead have been headed to Lebanon for the use of the Islamic militant group Hezbollah.\\"The Strange Affair of Karine-A\\", Brian Whitaker, Guardian, January 21, 2002. Some academics, such as Matthew Levitt,Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad, by Matthew Levitt, 2006, p. 176. Anthony CordesmanThe Israeli-Palestinian War: Escalating to Nowhere, by Anthony H. Cordesman 2005, p. 277. and Efraim KarshArafat's War: The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest, by Efraim Karsh, 2004, p. 236. have also supported the view that the ship was smuggling Iranian weapons to the Palestinian Authority. Israel subsequently arrested Fuad Shubaki, an Arafat aide who was in charge of finances in the PA and, as such, the mastermind behind the operation. He was charged with arms dealing and establishing connections with a foreign agent, for his role in financing the weapons ship. In 2006, Shubaki was taken into custody after an IDF raid on the Jericho prison where he was being held together with Ahmed Sa'adat‚Äîthe leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They were held together with other assassins of the former tourism minister Rehavam Ze'evi. Israel's prosecutor demanded that Shubaki must be sent to 25 years in prison, referring to the severity of his crimes. The court decided that Shubaki should be sentenced to a reduced sentence, keeping in mind his high age and health problems. Shubaki was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in jail.Man behind Karine A arms ship sentenced to 20 years in jailKarine A mastermind gets 20 years After his arrest in 2006, Shubaki told the Israelis that the PA funded terror cells such as his. He estimated that between $7 and $10 million was used every two years to purchase arms for the Gaza Strip. Additionally another $2 million was spent on weapons for the West Bank. According to Shubaki the money came from both international aid to the PA, tax money Israel routinely transferred to the PA and taxes collected from the Gaza Strip. He also confessed to his relationship in the purchasing of weapons for the head of the Tanzim terror group in Gaza. The Tanzim group was known for their attacks against military installations and Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. The smuggling attempt violated agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. These agreements state the amount and type of weapons that the Palestinian Authority is permitted to possess. Upper part of the mast of the weapons ship Karine A, captured by the Israeli navy Mohammad Javad Zarif argues that Arafat and Fatah were not allies with Iran at the time, asserting that Arafat was not allowed to meet with Ayatollah Khamenei during his stay in Tehran before this incident during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation conference.Mr. Embassador: A Conversation with Mohammad Javad Zarif, Ney Publications Tehran, page 166 =Diplomatic aftermath= United States president George W.

In fact, I never spoke to him again. By the spring of 2002, I had concluded that peace would not be possible with Arafat in power.\\"Decision Points by George W. Bush pp. 400-401 According to Douglas Feith, the Karine A episode hardened Vice President Dick Cheney's opinions of Yasser Arafat and convinced him that Arafat \\"was part of the global terrorist network.\\" Tonga has since suspended its international ship registry.

The collections and exhibitions include cultural items from around the world and archaeological objects predominantly from the American Midwest and Southwest. In 1999, the anthropology department and the museum moved to a new location in Neff Hall. The museum was expanded and Mr. Jerry Martin was hired as Director. This was the first time that the museum had a professional director whose only job was to work with, and develop the museum. Martin's concept was to have the museum essentially run and operated by students as part of their museum studies training. He raised funds to hire student staff to run the day-to-day operations of the museum under his supervision. As of the fall semester of 2006, the museum has the funds to hire five student positions. The museum has a wide range of functions. It has exhibitions open to the public, houses a rapidly expanding collection, a support unit for the anthropology department and faculty of Wichita State University, a research facility for students, a repository for United States Government archaeological collections, and the basis for a growing museum studies program. These different functions provide a very wide range of experience for the student staff. Important collections housed at the Holmes Museum =Asmat art collection= rightIn 2001 the museum led an expedition into Western New Guinea, where they compiled a major collection of over 950 pieces of Asmat tribal art. In the fall of 2001, the museum received the Bakwin collection of nearly 120 pieces of Asmat art. Asmat art is famous for its large size, beauty, artistic quality and rarity. This collection is rapidly becoming well known. The only other comparable collections in the United States are the Michael Rockefeller Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the collection of the Asmat Museum of Art in St. Paul, MN. =Southwest pottery and ethnographic art collections= The museum houses the John Morgan collection of Southwest pottery, and the Emma and John Huff collection of Southwest Jewelry. The Holmes museum also has an extensive collection of pre-historic pottery of the American southwest. =Pre-Columbian pottery collection= rightThe David Jackman collection consists of a large number of prehistoric Casas Grande and Colima ceramics. In addition, there is the Aitchison collection which contains a wide range of ceramics from prehistoric Pueblo cultures as well as Mayan, Veracruz and other Mesoamerican cultures. =Chinese minority clothing and ethnographic art collection= In 1988 and 1989 some museum staff and volunteers traveled to China to collect clothing and ethnographical objects from the minority Chinese groups. These trips produced an extensive collection from ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, Northwestern and Southern China, and Tibet. =Archaeology collections= The Anthropology Department has four different archaeology laboratories to process and research the extensive archaeology collections housed in the department and the Holmes Museum. The collections are predominantly from Kansas and contiguous state and the Four Corners area of the American Southwest. The museum is a repository for Federal Government Archaeological collections and an official Long Term Curation Facility for the Bureau of Reclamations. These collections are used by students for educational and research purposes. =Media resources collection= The museum recently began a program of digitizing anthropological audio-visual material for archival purposes. Most of the old audio tapes, 8mm and 16mm films and video tapes were created by anthropologists in the field or by missionaries. The museum's objective is to create a digitized collection of this material and make them available for research and other educational purposes. =Current exhibitions= rightRecently a new exhibition opened which shows the current theories on human evolution and physical diversity. One segment of the exhibit depicts Charles Darwin‚Äôs round the world voyage on where he developed his theory of Natural Selection. Another segment shows the separate development of Apes and Man throughout the last 34 million years. The second recently completed exhibition is called ‚ÄúSouthwestern Art: A Story of Transition and Change.‚Äù Located in the museum's Jackman Gallery this exhibit features the Morgan Collection of Southwest Pueblo pottery and the Mullen collection of Southwest Jewelry. It tells the story of the importance of the railroad and tourism in the revival of Southwestern Art and how the art has become a major source of income for many Pueblo families. The exhibit includes over 80 examples of beautiful pottery from 14 different pueblos, and jewelry and textiles from both the Hopi and Navajo. =Virtual exhibitions and websites= right Currently the museum has a website titled ‚ÄúThrough the Eyes of the Pot: The Morgan collection of Southwest Pottery‚Äù. This site shows the pots in the Morgan collection, gives a biography of the potters and has chapters on individual pueblos. There is also a virtual exhibit which includes home movie footage, artifacts and recollections from missionaries to the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. This interactive exhibit is called \\"The Wagner Collection Field Journal: 1955-1969\\". It blends oral history and multimedia to describe the observations of missionaries among the Duna, Hewa and Enga of Papua New Guinea. The museum has also developed a large and important website on the Asmat people of Papua, Indonesia titled \\"Art and Culture of the Asmat\\". Using the objects in the collection, photographs, as well as audio and video clips, the site explores the art, ceremonial life and culture of the Asmat people. Original documentary short films available on the website are also available on YouTube. Research The Holmes Museum sponsors a wide range of research and academic programs. There are a number of students in the museum studies program and several on-going and potential student research projects. For example: a number of students have requested to base their master's degree Projects on the Asmat collection. During the summer of 2003, students, led by the museum director Jerry Martin, traveled to the Guatemalan highlands to collect Mayan weavings and fiesta dance masks and study their symbolism and impact on the local indigenous populations. The objects they collect will become part of the museum's expanding contemporary Mayan ethnographic collection. During the summer of 2007, the museum director and an anthropology graduate student returned to the Asmat region of New Guinea to produce videos to be used in an Asmat website. This website integrates text, video and audio in order to create a multimedia educational resource for the public. They also gathered footage in the Korowai cultural area.

The Great Rock Discography, 7th Edition. Edinburgh: Canongate, 2004. 1159. is a punk rock drummer from Cleveland, Ohio, best known as being a member of the bands Dead Boys and Rocket From The Tombs.Strong, Martin C. The Great Indie Discography, 2nd Edition. Edinburgh: Canongate, 2003. 82. With the Dead Boys he helped pioneer the punk rock sound, look and attitude of the mid to late 1970s. Early career Johnny Blitz met Cheetah Chrome through a classified ad, and together went on to play small gigs in short-lived bands.http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/a-dead-boy-lives/Content?oid=2226671 In early 1975, Blitz and Chrome were recruited to Rocket From the Tombs. The band broke up within the year. After the break up, Blitz and Chrome teamed up with singer Stiv Bators, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Zero, and bassist Jeff Magnum to form a band called Frankenstein. Eventually, the band renamed themselves Dead Boys and recruited James Sliman to be their manager. A Boston Globe retrospective described a Dead Boys concert with Blitz on drums: On April 19, 1978, during his time with Dead Boys, Blitz and a group of friends were in Manhattan's East Village when they became involved in an altercation with a separate group. During the altercation, Blitz was stabbed 5 times. The injury caused him to be hospitalized for months. A four day benefit (Blitz Benefit) was held at CBGB to help with medical bills. Over 30 bands performed and a t-shirt was designed by Arturo Vega. Subsequent career After leaving Dead Boys and New York City in 1980, Johny Blitz moved to Toronto with his wife at that time, ‚ÄúB Girl\\" Lucasta Ross. He joined up with singer/guitarist/songwriter Leo DeLyon (n√© Leonard Nieberg) and bassist Tommy \\"Gun\\" Keating from power punk trio The Blitz (unrelated to Johnny's stage name). Blitz and DeLyon later formed a band called Slaughterhouse with Mark Crosley on bass. The band played Toronto's top clubs and concert venues with a large fan following that guaranteed a packed audience at every gig. Slaughterhouse and Cheetah Chrome's band, Cheetah Chrome and Skells, headlined on Saturday, August 6, 1983 at New York City's CBGB. Dead Boys bassist Jeff Magnum came to the show to see his old bandmates. Later that night, Magnum joined Chrome and Blitz on-stage to play some Dead Boys songs for the show's encore. After Blitz and Lucasta Ross split, he remarried and fathered three boys. Blitz and DeLyon went on to form The Tribe with keyboard player Polly Gruen and bassist Tommy \\"Gun\\" Keating. Together, The Tribe recorded originals that were a little more mainstream. After taking a few years off to focus on family, Blitz, DeLyon, and Keating regrouped back to their power punk three- piece hardcore roots to form Raw Dog. Over their twenty-five years together as band mates, the group co-wrote and arranged all original material. They recorded a number of unreleased songs at Comfort Sound and Metalworks studios. These songs included \\"In From the Cold\\", \\"I Like Girls\\", \\"Television Religion\\", \\"Call of the Wild\\", \\"Anxiety\\", \\"Kill 'Em All\\", and many more. Blitz returned to Cleveland for the Dead Boys reunion gig in 2004 at Cleveland's Beachland Ballroom. The reunion included a question-and-answer session at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. The reunited Dead Boys also performed at CBGB in 2005. Blitz and DeLyon went their separate ways in 2007. Between 2007 and 2011, Blitz continued as a drummer in a number of rock outfits including The Highschool Hookers (2007-2008). In September 2017, Blitz and Chrome reunited the Dead Boys with a new lineup for a 40th anniversary tour along with a new album, Still Snotty: Young, Loud and Snotty at 40, a re- recording of their debut album. The new lineup includes vocalist Jake Hout, guitarist Jason \\"Ginchy\\" Kottwitz and bassist Ricky Rat, alongside Chrome and Blitz.

History He was the son of the Spanish Jos√© Raimundo Carrillo, and brother of Carlos Antonio Carrillo, governor of Alta California, himself serving three non-consecutive terms as Comandante of Pueblo de Los Angeles - Mayor of Los Angeles between 1826 and 1834. Jos√© Antonio Carillo married Estefana Pico (1806-) in 1823, and after her death, Jacinta Pico (1815-) in 1842; both women were sisters of prominent Californios P√≠o Pico and Andr√©s Pico.Jose Antonio Ezequiel Carrillo (1796-1862) He built Carrillo House in Los Angeles, fronting the historic plaza, with wings extending back on Main Street. = Ranchos - Ventura = Jos√© Antonio Carrillo was the Mexican land grant grantee of Rancho Las Posas in 1834, in present-day Ventura County, California, and the Island of Santa Rosa of the Channel Islands. Political Activities Carrillo was alcalde of Los Angeles in 1826, 1828, and 1833. In 1836, Juan Bandini, a prominent political official who supported the American cause, was back in the revolution-making business - this time in opposition to Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. Carrillo returned from his post as territorial congressman in Mexico with the news that his brother, Carlos, had been appointed governor of Alta California to replace Alvarado, and that the capital had been changed from Monterey to Los Angeles. Mexican American War During the Siege of Los Angeles, Carrillo, along with Captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Flores and Andr√©s Pico, formed a militia to defend Alta California during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Carrillo distinguished himself by leading fifty Californio Lancers to victory at the Battle of Dominguez Rancho against 203 United States Marines; killing 14, and wounding several others, while not suffering a single casualty. The Americans, under the command of US Navy Captain William Mervine, were forced to retreat from what is presently Carson to San Pedro Bay. Commodore Robert F. Stockton, leader of the US Pacific Naval Fleet, was so taken aback by the strong resistance of the Californios that he immediately set sail for San Diego to regroup. Two months later, Stockton rescued US Army General Stephen W. Kearny's surrounded forces after the Battle of San Pasqual, and with their combined, re-supplied force, they moved northward from San Diego, entering the Los Angeles area on January 8, 1847, linking up with John C. Fr√©mont's Bear Flag battalion. With American forces totaling 660 soldiers and marines, they fought 150 Californios, led by Jos√© Mar√≠a Flores, with Carrillo second in command, in the Battle of Rio San Gabriel. The next day, January 9, 1847, they fought the Battle of La Mesa. On January 12, 1847, the last significant body of Californios surrendered to American forces. That marked the end of the war in California. On January 13, 1847, Carrillo, acting as a commissioner for Mexico, drafted in English and Spanish the Treaty of Cahuenga, and was present at the signing. Reputation \\"He was a man of remarkable natural abilities for the most part unimproved and wasted. Slight modifications in the conditions and his character might have made him the foremost in Californians - either the best or the worst. None excelled him in intrigue, and he was never without a plot on hand. A gambler, of loose habits, and utterly careless in his associations, he yet never lost the privilege of associating with the best or the power of winning their friendship. There was nothing he would not do to oblige a friend or get the better of a foe; and there were few of any note who were not at one time or another both his foes and friends. No Californian could drink so much brandy as he with so little effect. A man of fine appearance and iron constitution; of generous impulses, without much principle; one of the few original and prominent characters in early California annals.\\" Notable descendant His grand-nephew was actor Leo Carrillo, co-star of the TV series The Cisco Kid (1950‚Äì56), as Pancho, loyal partner of Cisco.

History  The history of the Herald stretches back to 2 pm on Monday 22 April 1895 when the Western Evening Herald was launched as Plymouth's first evening newspaper. Various other newspapers had come and gone in Plymouth in the preceding 100 years. The WEH was published by the owners of the Western Daily Mercury. It was then bought by Sir Leicester Harmsworth in 1921 ‚Äî a year after he bought the Western Morning News company ‚Äî and was renamed The Evening Herald and Western Evening News on 17 September 1923. On 24 May 1924, the name was changed again to the Western Evening Herald and Western Evening News. After changing format to tabloid in 1987, the title changed again to the Evening Herald, becoming simply The Herald in October 2006 when its print deadline shifted from midmorning (between 9 am and 11 am) to 1 am to accommodate the 120-mile distribution journey to Plymouth after printing was transferred to Weymouth in Dorset.

Both offices started operating as branch offices of NIB. By the end of 1961, the National Insurance Bureau was dissolved. The former NIB's branch offices became insurance bureaus but new insurance bureaus were also founded to cover the area of one or more municipalities.

It forms the headwaters of the Five Mile River, which is part of the Chicopee River Watershed. Information Brooks Pond is a mostly shallow pond dammed up roughly to its present size in 1848. The actual impoundment/size was again altered slightly after the Hurricane of 1938 washed out the existing bridge and resulted in a slight relocation of the spillway outlet/entry into the Five Mile River. Brooks Pond has been demonstrated via two separate recent studies, including one conducted by an expert firm, to originally have been well under in size in its naturally occurring state, thus disqualifying it as a Massachusetts Great Pond. This has been affirmed in a Massachusetts Court Case (Ref: Worcester Superior Court, Civil Action No. 04-0341, dated December 31, 2009. Judgment on Finding issued January 6, 2010). As noted above, it has been considerably enhanced in size by an earthen dam and cast spillway, and some parts range to 26 feet (8 m) in depth. The water is generally clean but exhibits slight coloration from leaf tannin and gets quite warm in the summertime. Brooks Pond is near a watershed boundary where waters to its north and west are part of the Ware River watershed and waters to its south and east are part of the Quaboag River watershed. Situated in a heavily forested area, the character of the pond in decades past‚Äîof mainly just summerhomes‚Äîhas yielded to increasing numbers of permanent, full-time residences along its lengthy shoreline. Fishing Brooks Pond offers limited fishing opportunities chiefly for the more experienced angler. While there are many warm-water fish present, the large shallow expanses extending beyond the original pond are too shallow, warm and de-oxygenated to support larger fish for much of the year. Less experienced and less skillful anglers thus catch mostly small fish and recite the old saw that the pond is over-fished‚Äîwhich it may be. Nevertheless, despite that popular mantra, Brooks gives up a few hefty largemouth bass to those with the skills to locate and catch them.

It is located southwest of Lindsay. Formerly a part of Mariposa Township and Victoria County, Little Britain is now part of Ward 8, City of Kawartha Lakes. History Little Britain was established in 1834 by Harrison Haight who built the first mill in 1837. This mill, which stood until 1910, took nearly the whole countryside to build. At the time, there was no road that led from Little Britain to Oakwood, located to the north. The first church was built in 1850, followed by the Bible Church in 1852. The Post Office came in 1853. Names suggested for the town were Margaretville, after Margaret Metherell, and Elm Grove, proposed by the first postmaster, Robert Fergusson Whiteside. The latter was rejected by the post office because of duplication, so Whiteside named it after his place of origin, Little Britain, Pennsylvania. Prominent members of the time included Joseph Maunder's carriage and blacksmithing works, W.M Burden's carriage shop, Edwin Mark's foundry, Isaac Finley's steam roller flour mill, Dr George Wesley Hall MD and the Davidson's flour mill. The railway was brought into Lindsay around the turn of the century. This however, did little to advance Little Britain's economic output. In fact the population of Mariposa Township declined sharply between 1871‚Äì1920 from 3,132 to 2,231. Today Little Britain today is still a primarily agricultural town. It also has a fairly significant tourist presence from the influx of cottagers on nearby Lake Scugog and from those who use Little Britain Road as a means to bypass heavy cottager summer traffic on Ontario Highway 7. For such a small town, Little Britain boasts a number of comfortable amenities including a restaurant, bakery, bank, library, grocery store, post office, park, arena and a country gift store as well as many other services.

History  = Founding of the House = Audience members participating in a Feminism/s event at the Kelly Writers House (photo thanks to Arielle Brousse) In 1995 Professor Al Filreis and a group of volunteers made up of faculty, students, staff and alumni of the University of Pennsylvania founded the Kelly Writers House. The group, the Writers House Planning Committee (also known as the \\"Hub\\"), aimed to create a central space where students of the University of Pennsylvania and members of the greater Philadelphia writing community could ‚Äúorganize, promote, and share‚Äù creative writing activities. Penn alumnus Paul Kelly funded renovations to the house itself, a cottage built as part of a Victorian suburban development project in 1851.History of the Kelly Writers House The renovations transformed the house, which had for many years been the home of a university chaplain, into a unique multi-purpose community space. What had once been the parlor became the Arts Caf√©, a south-facing room with large windows where classes and many Kelly Writers House events are held. The house also features a publications room, an office for the Kelly Writers House Hub, classroom space, and a dining room and kitchen, all open for events and student and Writers House community use. = Paul Kelly's support = In 1997, Paul Kelly, a University of Pennsylvania alumnus (C'62, WG'64) and investment banker, provided the initial grant the Writers House needed to flourish. Kelly funded renovations to the house itself, a Victorian cottage built in 1851. When the Writers House reopened after the renovations, the planning committee dedicated the reopening to Kelly's parents Thomas and Rita. Since his initial 1997 contribution Kelly has continued to support generously the house and its programs, including the Kelly Writers House Fellows Program, an annual project which brings eminent writers such as Susan Sontag, John Ashbery, T. Coraghessan Boyle, David Sedaris, Joyce Carol Oates, and Art Spiegelman to the Writers House for readings and discussions with students and members of the public. Kelly also continues to make major annual gifts to the house which ensure that the house will be a permanent fixture.Kelly Writers House  Mission  The Kelly Writers House aims to support and promote all activities related to the literary arts and to be a central and established location for writers, writing groups, and students of writing. Not affiliated with one particular school or major, the Writers House is a place for anyone interested in writing, regardless of his or her academic or professional path, a place to share a common identity through writing. As described in the original mission statement, the main goals of the house are to provide information about events and projects to those that are interested in participating in writing-related activities, to reserve space for engaging writers and students of writing in such activities, and to develop and sustain an environment in which disparate groups can work together with common goals and purposes. As a communitarian and capacious place, Writers House is ideal spot for the exchange of ideas, with robust space, too, in the virtual realm for electronic texts and electronic publishing. Read the original mission statement, authored by Shawn Lynn Walker and the Writers House Planning Committee in the notes.Kelly Writers House Mission Statement, authored by Shawn Lynn Walker and the Writers House Planning Committee  Community  = Community Members = Participants at a Kelly Writers House event honoring Gertrude Stein (photo thanks to Arielle Brousse) The Writers House community has many members that are affiliated with the House in a variety of ways.

The Writers House Planning Committee now consists of a 90-member volunteer group of undergraduate and graduate students, Penn faculty, staff, and alumni whose intellectual energy and collective spirit guides the House. The House also has a growing staff, including 15 student workers, a live-in resident intern, several part-time assistants, a Program Coordinator, and a Director, as well as a Faculty Director; together these staffers oversee the daily activities of the House, working side-by-side with our wide network of volunteers.

Croglin is a quiet picturesque fellside village between the Pennines and the River Eden, about south-east of Carlisle. The surrounding land is used for agriculture, mainly sheep. A small river, Croglin Water, flows through the valley down into the River Eden. A village has existed in this location for a long time and may originally have been two separate hamlets. There has been a church on the current site since the Norman period, but the present building, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, was erected in 1878 to a design by J. Hewison of Edinburgh. There is a post office, which opens two mornings a week, and a pub, the Robin Hood. Because of its proximity to the Scottish borders, the village was often raided by the Border Reivers in the 15th century. The lower two stories of a pele tower still survive, incorporated into the house formerly known as Croglin Vicarage, now The Old Pele, a testament to that need for defence. There is a tale of a vampire associated with the area. It has many versions, and some have accurate local details, many of which are available on other sites. A toy manufacturer, Croglin Toys, was set up in the village in 1980, but now operates from nearby Lazonby. A small dairy in the area, Thornby Moor Dairy, founded in 1979, has developed a type of cheese made from ewe's milk, known as Croglin Cheese. Etymology The name Croglin is probably a compound of a Middle English word cr≈çk, \\"bend\\", ultimately derived from Old Norse kr√≥kr, and Old English , \\"torrent\\". Though the location of Croglin favours this explanation, also possible is derivation from Brittonic cr«ñg, \\"abrupt/isolated hill\\" and l√Ønn, \\"a pool\\" is also possible (c.f. Welsh crug-llyn).

It was located within the military complex at JHQ Rheindahlen, near M√∂nchengladbach. The school operated from 1986 to 2013.End of era for JHQ Rheindahlen schools, BFBS, 17 July 2013 It was one of several secondary schools in Germany operated by the Service Children's Education organization. History Windsor School opened in 1987 with the merging of two long established Service Children's Schools; Queen's School, JHQ and Kent School which was in Hostert near Schwalmtal, North Rhine-Westphalia. Queen's School Rheindahlen opened in 1955 to provide day secondary school facilities for the children living in the new NATO Headquarters and adjacent British Garrisons and RAF Stations in the lower Rhineland. The founding headteacher was Mr George Wright. The rapid expansion of JHQ soon created a demand that was 50% in excess of Queens‚Äô capacity. To manage the shortfall admission was restricted to the children of families living within the JHQ complex. Children posted in and from families outside JHQ were forced to board. It was clear that greater provision was required. In 1963 the school was at its largest with 1100 pupils aged 11‚Äì18 years. When the three air bases were built at RAF Bruggen, RAF Wildenrath and RAF Laarbruch, there was a need for another secondary school in the area to accommodate the extra numbers. At the same time pupils from SHAPE and a variety of ISODETS required boarding provision. The site chosen was an old Franciscan Monastery at Hostert, just north west of Hardt village. The site had been converted into an emergency military hospital in the early 1960s for use in the event of war. The building was again converted, this time into a school and became Kent School in 1963 with boarders based at Chatham House and Deal House on JHQ, along with boarding at Medway House, close by Kent School. Medway catered for weekly boarders with the other two housing the termly boarders Windsor School took its name from SCE Windsor School in Hamm, that had operated from the early 1950s until 1983, initially as separate schools for boys and girls.School Prospectus Windsor School inherited the grounds and building of the former Queen's School with some building improvements such as an expansion of its West wing. In 1991 West Block was completed, adding two floors of classrooms and a Sixth Form Centre. It also became the highest part of the school. As a result of this build Kent School site at Hostert closed and was handed back to the German authorities in 1993. The new building was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester, Colonel-in- Chief RAMC on 25 March 1992. At its height Windsor School had over 1000 pupils. Following the disbandment of the British Army of the Rhine in 1995 and the subsequent drop in military personnel and accompanying families, the average fell to around 600. Windsor School was located on Snyders Road in JHQ. Pupils ranged from 11 to 19 years old, with some being day pupils from the surrounding JHQ garrison, some bussed in from nearby military bases and a number of weekly and termly boarders, who were accommodated in its two boarding houses, Windsor House and School House. The school operated in the same way as any secondary school in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, following the National Curriculum and inspected by Ofsted. The final Ofsted Inspection in 2010 judged the school to be outstanding. Windsor School had a Sixth Form, offering courses towards A Level and BTEC qualifications. Sixth Form extra-curricular activities included an annual RAG (Raising And Giving) Week, in which they hosted events to raise money for charities. Windsor School closed in summer 2013. School House closed its doors to boarders in July 2012, with all boarders catered for by Windsor House in the final year. During the final years the school was awarded Gold Artsmark, International Schools Award, Healthy Schools Award, Eco Schools Award and became an Enquiry School in Creative Partnerships.

When Descher was about five years old, her family had travelled across country to New York City where the girl fell in love with the theater after seeing The Red Shoes ballet on Broadway. On the way home, they stopped at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where coincidentally a film was being shot. The director saw her, and needing a child for the film, approached her parents. However, as they had to return home, they contacted the director later. Within six months, Descher appeared in her first movie, It Grows on Trees, which was released in 1952. Next she appeared in a brief, but key role in the classic science-fiction film, Them! (1954). She played a catatonic child whose parents have been killed by gigantic ants. Unable to speak, she can only scream \\"Them\\", giving the film its title. The movie's cast included Edmund Gwenn, James Arness, and James Whitmore. In 1954, a news item reported that Descher was \\"the only long-term contract child in Hollywood,\\" having been signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

In 1961, he was posthumously enshrined as a coach in the Basketball Hall of Fame. He was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 7, 1897. Sachs attended Carl Schurz High School in Chicago, where he earned 11 varsity letters before his graduation in 1914. Upon graduation from high school, Sachs joined the United States Navy during World War I, where he continued playing sports, earning an All-Service team honorable mention in football in 1918 while playing on the Cleveland Naval Reserves football team. After the war, Sachs enrolled at Chicago's American College of Physical Education‚Äîwhich later merged with DePaul University‚Äîand graduated in 1923. While at college, Sachs played for the Chicago Cardinals in the National Football League (NFL) from 1920 to 1922. Sachs was hired as basketball coach in 1923 at Loyola University Chicago, even while continuing his NFL career. From 1923 to 1926 Sachs played for the Milwaukee Badgers, Hammond Pros, and Louisville Colonels, ending his career as a player-coach for the 1926 Louisville Colonels, a road-only team based in Chicago.

In 1927‚Äì28, the team set a new Loyola record for wins in a season by earning a record of 16‚Äì4. And in 1928‚Äì29, Loyola was a perfect 16-0 under Sachs' guidance. Loyola recorded 31 consecutive victories between 1928 and 1930.

Its members, called deputies, were appointed by popular election called by the liberator Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who then exercised power as Protector of Peru. The main task of this meeting was to give the Republic of Peru its first constitution, which was the liberal constitution of 1823. Also, before the retirement of San Mart√≠n, presented the Executive to three members, who formed a collegial body called the Supreme Governing Board and whose head was General Jos√© de la Mar. subsequently ratified in succession to the former presidents of the Republic of Peru: Jos√© de la Riva Ag√ºero and Jos√© Bernardo de Tagle (better known as the Marquis of Torre Tagle). Background After the proclamation of the independence of Peru, the ancient capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Lima, on July 28, 1821, General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n assumed command of the military political free departments of Peru, under the title protector, according to the decree of August 3, 1821. San Mart√≠n was the one who gave the state its first Peruvian flag, anthem, currency, and its administration and its first primitive institutions. But it remained to give a Constitution and meanwhile, a temporary regulation was imposed, later replaced by a statute. On December 27, 1821, San Mart√≠n called for the first time the people to choose freely a Constituent Congress, with the mission to establish the form of government that henceforth would govern Peru, and a proper constitution. Installation On September 20, 1822 was installed the first Constituent Congress of Peru, composed of 79 deputies (elected) and 38 alternates (for realistic territories). Its members had the most prominent members of the clergy, the forum, letters and sciences. Before this Congress, San Mart√≠n resigned the protectorate and joined to leave Peru. For the preparatory meetings, the Congress elected Toribio Rodr√≠guez de Mendoza, the precursor of independence, the same who had been rector of Convictorio of San Carlos, where he trained in the philosophy of enlightenment to the generation of Independence. Much of his former students now were included as deputies. President of the Congress was the elected deputy from Arequipa Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, and secretaries Jos√© Faustino S√°nchez Carri√≥n ‚Äì author of the famous letters of \\"El Perro\\", which called for the federal republic form of government, and Francisco Javier Mari√°tegui, also a liberal. Appointment of the Governing Board Lawmakers began to deliver the executive to a group of three members, who formed a collegial body called the Supreme Governing Board (chaired by Jos√© de La Mar and including Manuel Salazar and Antonio Alvarado and Felipe Baqu√≠jano). The Board took office on September 21, 1822. On November 4, Congress agreed thanksgiving to Lord Thomas Cochrane, Colombia, the Liberation Army, Chile and the Supreme Director and expressed its appreciation to the indigenous guerrillas and even the natural forest for their services in favor of independence. It also gave broad amnesty, even to the Spanish. The only exception was the former minister Bernardo de Monteagudo, who was banned, establishing penalties for authorities to allow him to live freely in their districts. On November 22, Congress gave the coup de gr√¢ce to the monarchical illusion. San Mart√≠n overruled the Commission of Juan Garcia del R√≠o and James Paroissien, who had been sent to Europe to find a king for Peru and on 22 December of that year, the Congress established the \\"Bases of the Constitution\\" which, among the many reforms, stresses the abolition of the trade in \\"negros\\".Basadre 1998, p. 10. The meeting was also devoted to the organization of the country into departments, provinces and districts. Political and military crisis The main task of the legislators, that is drafting the first Constitution of independent Peru and legislative work was hampered by the difficult circumstances that arose in late 1822 and early 1823. There were no resources to pay salaries to military and civilian employees, and around the capital were ravaged by bandits. As for the war against the Spanish who still held out in southern Peru, the Governing Board decided to conduct the military plan of San Mart√≠n, to attack the royalists from South intermediate ports. But it needed outside military help. Indeed, it was already underway to support the Northern Liberator, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, head of Gran Colombia, who had helped Peru to defeat the Spanish who were left throughout southern Peru, including what is now Bolivia. During the Guayaquil conference, Bol√≠var, San Mart√≠n had offered military aid to Peru, which was founded in July 1822 with the dispatch of Colombian troops under the command of Juan Paz del Castillo. In September of that year, Bol√≠var returned to offer another 4,000 troops, but the brand new Governing Board accepted the reception of only 4,000 rifles. Relations between Peru and Gran Colombia entered its most critical point due to the annexation of Guayaquil to Grancolombiano territory. Added to that were the instructions he had received from Juan Paz del Castillo, not to commit their forces in case they were guaranteed success only in northern Peru. He soon came into conflict with the interests of Peru and Colombia and returned home in January 1823. Relations with Gran Colombia cooled, then, at the very moment when the campaign was being waged Intermediate. This expedition ended in failure after the defeat of the patriot army in Torata and Moquegua (19 and 21 January 1823). From then dates the letrilla burlesque to the Spanish Congress that spread from their camp situated a short distance from Lima: Congress and the Governing Board were so terribly discredited in public opinion. The patriotic officers commanding the troops that guarded Lima, fearing a Spanish offensive, signed a petition to Congress, dated February 23, 1823 in Miraflores, invoking the name of one Supreme Head \\"to order and be quickly obeyed\\", replacing the collegial body that belonged to the Board, even suggested the name of the officer to assume the government stated: Colonel Jos√© de la Riva Ag√ºero y S√°nchez Boquete. The crisis deepened when another petition to Congress was presented by the civic militia stationed in Bellavista and a third headed by Mariano Tramarr√≠a. On February 27 troops moved from their quarters to the estate of Balconcillo, half a league from Lima, where they demanded the dismissal of the Board. These rebels were led by General Andr√©s de Santa Cruz. It was the first coup in the republican history of Peru, known as the Balconcillo Mutiny. Given the pressure that day, Congress agreed to dismiss the Governing Board and an interim order to the highest office highest-ranking military leader was Jos√© Bernardo de Tagle. On February 28, Congress ordered to release to General Jos√© de La Mar, who had been arrested at his home, citing General Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, who made an oral presentation of the position of the heads and concluded that Congress obeyed the order but if not named Jos√© de la Riva Ag√ºero as President, he and military leaders would resign and would leave the country. Given the statement made by Santa Cruz, Congress named Riva Ag√ºero as President by 39 votes for a total of 60, not assigned duties and deadlines. Previously Riva Ag√ºero was promoted to the rank of Grand Marshal. Such events divided Congress. Some Members felt that he had exerted pressure on the so- called \\"sovereign Congress\\", which was inadmissible and many of them did not return to session. The Congress president, Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, exiled himself in protest. From that time began to coexist two major factions: the realistic or Spanish and separatist or patriot. The separatist or patriot was divided initially into republicans and monarchists, the latter being discarded, was divided into parliamentary and liberal caudillo. Riva Ag√ºero thus became the first president of the Peruvian Republic, though elected de facto. This person would conclude without foreign aid the war of independence of Peru, which organized the Second Intermediate Campaign, which, like the first, ended in failure. Discord soon broke out between Congress and Riva Ag√ºero. Congress ruled that Trujillo be moved to the executive and legislative branches also created a military power confided to Venezuelan General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre (who had arrived in Peru in May of that year), and sent a delegation to Colombia to request personal collaboration of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in the war against the Spanish (June 19, 1823). Next, Congress granted the same powers Sucre equal to those of President for the duration of the crisis, and on June 23 ruled that remain exempt from Riva Ag√ºero supreme command. Riva Ag√ºero did not comply with that provision and Trujillo sailed with part of the authorities. He kept his inauguration as President, ordered the dissolution of Congress (July 19), created a Senate of ten members and organized troops. While in Lima, Congress was again called by the Provisional President Jos√© Bernardo de Tagle, the August 6, 1823. The Congress recognized Tagle as President of the Republic. In the midst of this grave crisis, in which two presidents vied for power, Tagle Constitution promulgated on 12 November 1823. Soon after Riva Ag√ºero was arrested and deported, unifying control of the country and around Bol√≠var, while Tagle was reduced to figurehead. The Constitution of 1823 The main work of the Constituent Congress was undoubtedly drafting the first Constitution of independent Peru, which was liberal inspiration. The first step was the development of the \\"Bases of the Constitution\\" at the hands of a congressional committee, composed of the deputies Justo Figuerola, Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo, Manuel Perez de Tudela and Hip√≥lito Unanue. These \\"bases\\" were issued by the Governing Board on December 17, 1822, consisted of 24 items, which broadly stated that all the provinces of Peru, gathered in one body, formed the Peruvian nation, that from then be called \\"Republic of Peru\\", also stated that sovereignty resided in the nation, and is independent of the Spanish monarchy and any other foreign domination would be the Catholic religion to the exclusion of any other, and as for the National Power, would be divided into three branches, Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Discussed the Constitution, was approved and promulgated by President Torre Tagle, the November 12, 1823. But a day earlier, the Congress ordered the suspension of his articles that were inconsistent with the powers granted to the liberator Bol√≠var, who was already under way to establish the dictatorship. In practice it was in effect for the duration of the Bol√≠varian regime. After some years, was restored on June 11, 1827 by Congress after the fall meeting of the Bol√≠varian regime or for life. The Vice President and Baquijano Manuel Salazar, head of the executive, was sent to fulfill the 16 June of that year. Force until March 18, 1828, being replaced by the liberal Constitution of 1828.

It is a generic name for plays in which declarer maximizes the chances for obtaining a certain number of tricks or the maximum number of tricks when considering the suit in isolation. Sometimes the percentage play is not the correct play considering the hand as a whole as an avoidance play or safety play may be more appropriate. In matchpoint games, which use comparative scoring, overtricks are very important, accordingly most hands are played simply to achieve the greatest number of tricks possible and risks may be taken to achieve overtricks that would not be considered at other types of scoring. Against a contract of 3NT West opens with the Q, and the A wins in dummy. In many types of bridge this hand calls for a safety play in which declarer reaches his hand (perhaps with the A and leads a 4 putting in the 10. This will ensure communication between the hands since the A has already been knocked out. However, this is not the percentage play. Approximately 68% of the time the clubs will be found three in one hand and two in the other (a 3-2 break) and simply cashing the A, K and Q will result in an additional trick. This is the play with the highest percentage of bringing in all the tricks. If the west hand had J976 the percentage play would result in only 3 club tricks and 8 tricks in all so the contract would fail, but that is not likely to happen. At matchpoints the best play would be to try to take the percentage play in as many suits as possible. The declarer would win on the board and play the 2 and finesse in hearts. West winning with the Q might persist with spades, but South wins in hand with K and plays all the good clubs, later taking the heart finesse again to make 12 tricks. The percentage play can also vary based on how many tricks are wanted or needed out of a suit: If declarer needs all of the tricks, the percentage play is to play one of the high honours first, then finesse the jack followed by the other high honour. This hopes to find West with Qxx, which is more likely than finding Qx with East. However, if only three tricks are needed, then it is better to cash first the two top honours and then lead low towards the jack.

The verb to blazon means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag has traditionally had considerable latitude in design, but a verbal blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements. A coat of arms or flag is therefore primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though in modern usage flags are often additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). Blazon is also the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, the act of writing such a description. Blazonry is the art, craft or practice of creating a blazon. The language employed in blazonry has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. Other armorial objects and devices ‚Äì such as badges, banners, and seals ‚Äì may also be described in blazon. The noun and verb blazon (referring to a verbal description) are not to be confused with the noun emblazonment, or the verb to emblazon, both of which relate to the graphic representation of a coat of arms or heraldic device. Etymology The word blazon is derived from French blason, \\"shield\\". It is found in English by the end of the 14th century. Formerly, heraldic authorities believed that the word was related to the German verb blasen, \\"to blow (a horn)\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 9th. ed., vol.11, p.683, \\"Heraldry\\" Present-day lexicographers reject this theory as conjectural and disproved. Grammar Blazon is generally designed to eliminate ambiguity of interpretation, to be as concise as possible, and to avoid repetition and extraneous punctuation. English antiquarian Charles Boutell stated in 1864: However, John Brooke-Little, Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, wrote in 1985: \\"Although there are certain conventions as to how arms shall be blazoned ... many of the supposedly hard and fast rules laid down in heraldic manuals [including those by heralds] are often ignored.\\"J. P. Brooke- Little: An Heraldic Alphabet; new and revised edition, p. 52\\\\. London: Robson Books, 1985. A given coat of arms may be drawn in many different ways, all considered equivalent and faithful to the blazon, just as the letter \\"A\\" may be printed in many different fonts while still being the same letter. For example, the shape of the escutcheon is almost always immaterial, with very limited exceptions (e.g., the coat of arms of Nunavut, for which a round shield is specified). The main conventions of blazon are as follows: * Every blazon of a coat of arms begins by describing the field (background), with the first letter capitalised, followed by a comma \\",\\". In a majority of cases this is a single tincture; e.g. Azure (blue). * If the field is complex, the variation is described, followed by the tinctures used; e.g. Chequy gules and argent (checkered red and white). * If the shield is divided, the division is described, followed by the tinctures of the subfields, beginning with the dexter side (shield bearer's right, but viewer's left) of the chief (upper) edge; e.g. Party per pale argent and vert (dexter half silver, sinister half green), or Quarterly argent and gules (clockwise from viewer's top left, i.e. dexter chief: white, red, white, red). In the case of a divided shield, it is common for the word \\"party\\" or \\"parted\\" to be omitted (e.g., Per pale argent and vert, a tree eradicated counterchanged). * Some authorities prefer to capitalise the names of tinctures and charges, but this convention is far from universal. Where tinctures are not capitalised, an exception may be made for the metal Or, in order to avoid confusion with the English word \\"or\\". Where space is at a premium, tincture names may be abbreviated: e.g., ar. for argent, gu. for gules, az. for azure, sa. for sable, and purp. for purpure. * Following the description of the field, the principal ordinary or ordinaries and charge(s) are named, with their tincture(s); e.g., a bend or. * The principal ordinary or charge is followed by any other charges placed on or around it. If a charge is a bird or a beast, its attitude is defined, followed by the creature's tincture, followed by anything that may be differently coloured; e.g. An eagle displayed gules armed and wings charged with trefoils or (see the coat of arms of Brandenburg below). * Counterchanged means that a charge which straddles a line of division is given the same tinctures as the divided field, but reversed (see the arms of Behnsdorf below). * A quartered (composite) shield is blazoned one quarter (panel) at a time, proceeding by rows from chief (top) to base, and within each row from dexter (the right side of the bearer holding the shield) to sinister; in other words, from the viewer's left to right. * Following the description of the shield, any additional components of the achievement ‚Äì such as crown/coronet, helmet, torse, mantling, crest, motto, supporters and compartment ‚Äì are described in turn, using the same terminology and syntax. * A convention often followed historically was to name a tincture explicitly only once within a given blazon. If the same tincture was found in different places within the arms, this was addressed either by ordering all elements of like tincture together prior to the tincture name (e.g., Argent, two chevrons and a canton gules); or by naming the tincture only at its first occurrence, and referring to it at subsequent occurrences obliquely, for example by use of the phrase \\"of the field\\" (e.g., Argent, two chevrons and on a canton gules a lion passant of the field); or by reference to its numerical place in the sequence of named tinctures (e.g., Argent, two chevrons and on a canton gules a lion passant of the first: in both these examples, the lion is argent). However, these conventions are now avoided by the College of Arms in London, and by most other formal granting bodies, as they may introduce ambiguity to complex blazons. * It is common to print all heraldic blazons in italic.Boutell 1864, p. 11. Heraldry has its own vocabulary, word-order and punctuation, and presenting it in italics indicates to the reader the use of a quasi-foreign language. File:Azure, a bend Or.svgAzure, a bend or.

Arms of Churchill.Courtenay, P. The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill . The Churchill Centre. =French vocabulary and grammar= Because heraldry developed at a time when English clerks wrote in Anglo-Norman French, many terms in English heraldry are of French origin. Some of the details of the syntax of blazon also follow French practice: thus, adjectives are normally placed after nouns rather than before. A number of heraldic adjectives may be given in either a French or an anglicised form: for example, a cross patt√©e or a cross patty; a cross fitch√©e or a cross fitchy. In modern English blazons, the anglicised form tends to be preferred. Where the French form is used, a problem may arise as to the appropriate adjectival ending, determined in normal French usage by gender and number. The usual convention in English heraldry is to adhere to the feminine singular form, for example: a chief und√©e and a saltire und√©e, even though the French nouns chef and sautoir are in fact masculine. Efforts have however been made, for example by J. E. Cussans, who suggested that all French adjectives should be expressed in the masculine singular, without regard to the gender and number of the nouns they qualify, thus a chief und√© and a saltire und√©. Complexity Full descriptions of shields range in complexity, from a single word to a convoluted series describing compound shields: *Arms of Brittany: Ermine *Azure, a Bend Or, over which the families of Scrope and Grosvenor fought a famous legal battle (see Scrope v.

History =Early 19th century= City College of New York in 2010, North Campus, looking west. Wingate Hall on the left, Townsend Harris Hall in the background. The City College of New York was founded as the Free Academy of the City of New York in 1847 by wealthy businessman and president of the Board of Education Townsend Harris.Traub, James. City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College. Addison- Wesley, 1984. A combination prep school, high school / secondary school and college, it would provide children of immigrants and the poor access to free higher education based on academic merit alone. It was one of the early public high schools in America following earlier similar institutions being founded in Boston (1829), Philadelphia (1838), and Baltimore (1839). The Free Academy was the first of what would become a system of municipally-supported colleges ‚Äì the second, Hunter College, was founded as a women's institution in 1870; and the third, Brooklyn College, was established as a coeducational institution in 1930. In 1847, New York State Governor John Young had given permission to the state Board of Education to found the Free Academy, which was ratified in a statewide referendum. Founder Townsend Harris proclaimed, \\"Open the doors to all‚Ä¶ Let the children of the rich and the poor take their seats together and know of no distinction save that of industry, good conduct and intellect.\\" Dr. Horace Webster (1794‚Äì1871), a United States Military Academy at West Point graduate, was the first president of the Free Academy. On the occasion of The Free Academy's formal opening, January 21, 1849, Webster said: > The experiment is to be tried, whether the children of the people, the > children of the whole people, can be educated; and whether an institution of > the highest grade, can be successfully controlled by the popular will, not > by the privileged few.Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Report > of the Commission on the Future of CUNY: Part I Remediation and Access: To > Educate the \\"Children of the Whole People\\", 1999. A view of the original entrance to Shepard Hall, the main building of the City College of New York, in the early 1900s, on its new campus in Hamilton Heights, from St. Nicholas Avenue looking up westward to St. Nicholas Terrace In 1847, a curriculum was adopted which had nine main fields: mathematics, history, language, literature, drawing, natural philosophy, experimental philosophy, law, and political economy. The Academy's first graduation took place in 1853 in Niblo's Garden Theatre,\\"Niblo's Garden\\" ‚Äì Demolished Theatres, musicals101.com a large theater and opera house on Broadway, near Houston Street at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street. Even in its early years, the Free Academy showed tolerance for diversity, especially in comparison to its urban neighbor, Columbia College, which was exclusive to the sons of wealthy families. The Free Academy had a framework of tolerance that extended beyond the admission of students from every social stratum. In 1854, Columbia's trustees denied distinguished chemist and scientist Oliver Wolcott Gibbs a faculty position because of Gibbs's Unitarian religious beliefs. Gibbs was a professor and held an appointment at the Free Academy since 1848.Cf. Bender, pp. 271‚Äì273 (In 1863, Gibbs went on to an appointment at Harvard College, the Rumsford Professorship in Chemistry, where he had a distinguished career. In 1873, he was awarded an honorary degree from Columbia with a unanimous vote by its Trustees with the strong urging of Columbia president Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard.Cf. Bender, p. 273, footnotes.) Later in the history of CCNY, in the early 1900s, President John H. Finley gave the college a more secular orientation by abolishing mandatory chapel attendance.Cf. Bender, pp. 291‚Äì292 This change occurred at a time when more Jewish students were enrolling in the college. =Late 19th century= 1876 Statue of General Alexander S. Webb (1835‚Äì1911), second president of CCNY (1869‚Äì1903) In 1866, the Free Academy, a men's institution, was renamed the \\"College of the City of New York\\". In 1929, the College of the City of New York became the \\"City College of New York\\".Rudy, Willis, The College of the City of New York: A History 1847‚Äì1947, City College Press 1949. Also issued as a thesis by Columbia University. Reprinted in 1977 by the Arno Press.Minutes, Trustees, Board of Higher Education, 1929, p. 194Subway College, in Time magazine, October 28, 1946. Finally, the institution became known as the \\"City College of the City University of New York\\" when the CUNY was formally established as the umbrella institution for New York City's municipal-college system in 1961. The names City College of New York and City College, however, remain in general use. With the name change in 1866, lavender was chosen as the college's color. In 1867, the academic senate, the first student government in the nation, was formed. Having struggled over the issue for ten years, in 1895, the New York state Legislature voted to let the City College build a new campus. A four-square block site was chosen, located in Manhattanville, within the area which was enclosed by the North Campus Arches; the College, however, quickly expanded north of the Arches. Like President Webster, the second president of the newly renamed City College was a West Point graduate. The second president, General Alexander S. Webb (1835-1911), assumed office in 1869, serving for almost the next three decades. One of the Union Army's heroes at Gettysburg, General Webb was the commander of the Philadelphia Brigade. In 1891, while still president of the City College, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism at Gettysburg. A full-length statue of Webb, in full military uniform, stands in his honor at the heart of the campus.The statue is on the east side of Convent Avenue near both Shepherd Hall and the Administration Building. College library bookplate with an early version of the college seal from the era when the institution was named the College of the City of New York, 1866‚Äì1929 The college's curriculum under Webster and Webb combined classical training in Latin and Greek with more practical subjects like chemistry, physics, and engineering. One of the outstanding Nineteenth Century graduates of City College was the Brooklyn-born George Washington Goethals, who put himself through the college in three years before going on to West Point. He later became the chief engineer on the Panama Canal project (1903‚Äì1914) with one of the excavation cuts named for him. General Webb was succeeded by John Huston Finley (1863‚Äì1940), as third president in 1903. Finley relaxed some of the West Point-like discipline that characterized the college, including compulsory religious chapel attendance. Phi Sigma Kappa placed its sixth oldest chapter on the campus in 1896, flourishing until 1973, and whose alumni still provide scholarships to new students entering the CCNY system. Delta Sigma Phi was founded at CCNY in 1899 as a social fraternity based on the principle of the brotherhood of man. It was the first national organization of its type to accept members without regard to religion, race, color or creed. The chapter flourished at the college until 1932 when it closed as a result of the Great Depression. The founding of another national fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau, took place at City College on December 1898 by Dr. Richard Gottheil who aimed at establishing a Jewish fraternity with Zionist ideals. This chapter, however, has become defunct. =Early 20th century= Education courses were first offered in 1897 in response to a city law that prohibited the hiring of teachers who lacked a proper academic background. The School of Education was established in 1921. The college newspaper, The Campus, published its first issue in 1907, and the first degree-granting evening session in the United States was started. Separate Schools of Business and Civic Administration and of Technology (Engineering) were established in 1919. Students were also required to sign a loyalty oath. In 1947, the College celebrated its centennial year, awarding honorary degrees to Bernard Baruch (class of 1889) and Robert F. Wagner (class of 1898). A 100-year time capsule was buried in North Campus. Until 1929, City College had been an all-male institution. During that time, specifically in 1909, the first chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity was founded. In 1930, CCNY admitted women for the first time, but only to graduate programs. In 1951, the entire institution became coeducational. In the years when top- flight private schools were restricted to the children of the Protestant establishment, thousands of brilliant individuals (including Jewish students) attended City College because they had no other option. CCNY's academic excellence and status as a working-class school earned it the titles \\"Harvard of the Proletariat\\", the \\"poor man's Harvard\\", and \\"Harvard-on-the-Hudson\\". Even today, after three decades of controversy over its academic standards, no other public college has produced as many Nobel laureates who have studied and graduated with a degree from a particular public college (all graduated between 1935 and 1963).see article Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation CCNY's official quote on this is \\"Nine Nobel laureates claim CCNY as their Alma Mater, the most from any public college in the United States.\\"\\"CCNY ‚Äì An Experiment in Democracy Going Strong Over 160 Years Later\\" ‚Äì CCNY website press information\\"Nine graduates of City College have won the Nobel Prize\\", CCNY website press information This should not be confused with Nobel laureates who teach at a public university; UC Berkeley boasts 19. Many City College Alumni also served in the U.S. Armed Forces during the Second World War (1939/41‚Äì1945). A total of 310 CCNY alumni were killed in the War. Prior to World War II, a large number of City College alumni‚Äîrelative to alumni of other U.S. colleges‚Äîvolunteered to serve on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). Thirteen CCNY alumni were killed in Spain.Memorial plaques providing the numbers and honoring those who gave their lives can be found in the second floor rotunda of the NAC building on the CCNY campus. In its heyday of the 1930s through the 1950s, CCNY became known for its political radicalism. It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria in the basement of Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, was the only place in the world where a fair debate between Trotskyists and Stalinists could take place.\\"Arguing the World\\" ‚Äì PBS documentary, 1997.\\"Finding My Way to the Alcoves\\" ‚Äì Joseph Dorman, film director of \\"Arguing the World\\". Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, Irving Howe reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class. When he returned to the cafeteria late in the day, he would find that the same debate had continued but with an entirely different cast of students. Alumni who were at City College in the mid-20th century said that City College in those days made the famous radicalism at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s look like a school of conformity. The municipality of New York was considerably more conformist than CCNY students and faculty. The Philosophy Department, at the end of the 1939/40 academic year, invited the British mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell to become a professor at CCNY. Members of the Roman Catholic Church protested Russell's appointment. A woman named Jean Kay filed suit against the state Board of Higher Education to block Russell's appointment on the grounds that his views on marriage and sex would adversely affect her daughter's virtue, although her daughter was not a CCNY student. Russell wrote \\"a typical American witch-hunt was instituted against me.\\"Bertrand Russell, The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: The Middle Years: 1914‚Äì1944. Bantam, 1969, p. 320. Kay won the suit, but the Board declined to appeal after considering the political pressure exerted.Thom Weidlich. Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell. Prometheus Books, 2000. Also see The Bertrand Russell Case. Russell took revenge in the preface of the first edition of his book An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth, which was published by the Unwin Brothers in the United Kingdom (the preface was not included in the U.S. editions). In a long pr√©cis that detailed Russell's accomplishments including medals awarded by Columbia University and the Royal Society and faculty appointments at Oxford, Cambridge, UCLA, Harvard, the Sorbonne, Peking (the name used in that era), the LSE, Chicago, and so forth, Russell added, \\"Judicially pronounced unworthy to be Professor of Philosophy at the College of the City of New York.\\" =Late 20th century= In 1945, Professor William E. Knickerbocker, Chairman of the Romance Languages Department, was accused of anti-semitism by four faculty members. They claimed that \\"for at least seven years they have been subjected to continual harassment and what looks very much like discrimination\\" by Knickerbocker.Morris Freedman, \\"The Knickerbocker Case\\", Commentary, August 1945. Four years later Knickerbocker was again accused of anti-semitism, this time for denying honors to high-achieving Jewish students. About the same time, Professor William C. Davis of the Economics Department was accused by students of maintaining a racially segregated dormitory at Army Hall. Professor Davis was the dormitory's administrator. CCNY students, many of whom were World War II veterans, launched a massive strike in protest against Knickerbocker and Davis. The New York Times called the event \\"the first general strike at a municipal institution of higher learning.\\" Also see the Knickerbocker Case. In 1955, a City College student named Alan A. Brown founded the economics honor society, Omicron Chi Epsilon. The purpose of the society was to confer honors on outstanding economics students, organize academic meetings, and publish a journal. In 1963, Omicron Chi Epsilon merged with Omicron Delta Gamma, the other economics honor society, to form Omicron Delta Epsilon, the current academic honor society in economics. As student radicalism increased in the late 1960s, with the Civil Rights Movement and anti-Vietnam War feelings increased. culminating at CCNY during a 1969 protest takeover of the South campus,Reitano, Joanne R., \\"The Restless City: A Short History of New York from Colonial Times to the Present\\", CRC Press, 2006. . Cf. page 176. under threat of a riot, African American and Puerto Rican activists and their white allies demanded, among other policy changes, that the City College implement an aggressive affirmative action program to increase minority enrollment and provide academic support. At some point, campus protesters began referring to CCNY as \\"Harlem University.\\" The administration of the City University at first balked at the demands, but instead, came up with an open admissions or open-access program under which any graduate of a New York City high school would be able to matriculate either at City College or another college in the CUNY system. Beginning in 1970, the program opened doors to college to many who would not otherwise have been able to attend college. The increased enrollment of students, regardless of college preparedness, however, challenged City College's and the University's academic reputation and strained New York City's financial resources. City College began charging tuition in 1976. But after three decades, by 1999, the CUNY Board of Trustees voted to eliminate remedial classes at all CUNYs senior colleges, thereby eliminating a central pillar of the policy of Open Admissions and effectively ending it. Students who could not meet the academic entrance requirements for CUNY's senior colleges were forced to enroll in the system's community colleges, where they could prepare for an eventual transfer to one of the 4-year institutions. Since this decision, all CUNY senior colleges, especially CCNY, have begun to rise in prestige nationally, as evinced by school rankings and incoming freshman GPA and SAT scores. In addition, the end of open admissions sparked a change in CUNY's student demographics, with the number of Black and Hispanic students decreasing and the number of White Caucasian and Asian students increasing. As a result of the 1989 student protests and building takeovers concerning tuition increases, a community action center was opened on the campus called the Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center, located in the NAC building. The center was named after CUNY alums and radical freedom fighters Assata Shakur and Guillermo Morales, both of whom are now in political exile in Cuba. Students and neighborhood residents who used the Center for community organizing against issues of racism, police brutality, and the privatization and militarization of CUNY faced constant repression or opposition from the City College administration for years.Wise, Daniel, \\"First Amendment Violation Claim Proceeds Against College Over Removed Plaque\\", New York Law Journal, April 8, 2010 After a long controversy, on October 20, 2013, City College seized the Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center in the middle of the night, provoking a student demonstration. CCNY's new Frederick Douglass Debate Society defeated Harvard and Yale at the \\"Super Bowl\\" of the American Parliamentary Debate Association in 1996. In 2003, the college's Model UN Team was awarded as an Outstanding Delegation at the National Model United Nations (NMUN) Conference, an honor that it would repeat for four years in a row. The U.S. Postal Service issued a postcard commemorating CCNY's 150th anniversary, featuring Shepard Hall, on Charter Day, May 7, 1997. =21st century= Engineering School The City University of New York began recruiting students for the University Scholars program in the fall 2000, and admitted the first cohort of undergraduate scholars in the fall 2001. CCNY was one of five CUNY campuses, on which the program was initiated. The newly admitted scholars became undergraduates in the college's newly formed Honors Program. Students attending the CCNY Honors College are awarded free tuition, a cultural passport that admits them to New York City cultural institutions for free or at sharply reduced prices, a notebook computer, and an academic expense account that they can apply to such academic-related activities as study abroad. These undergraduates are also required to attend a number of specially developed honors courses. In 2001 CUNY initiated the CUNY Honors College, renamed Macaulay Honors College in 2007.\\"History: Macaulay Honors College\\" , CUNY website Both the CCNY Honors Program and the CCNY chapter of the Macaulay Honors College are run out of the CCNY Honors Center. In October 2005, Dr. Andrew Grove, a 1960 graduate of the Engineering School in Chemical Engineering, and co-founder of Intel Corporation, donated $26 million to the Engineering School, which has since been renamed the Grove School of Engineering. It is the largest donation ever given to the City College of New York. In August 2008, the authority to grant doctorates in engineering was transferred from the CUNY Graduate Center to City College Grove School of Engineering.Grove School of Engineering: About the Ph.D. Program In 2009, the School of Architecture moved into the former Y Building, which was gutted and completely remodeled under the design direction of architect Rafael Vi√±oly.

Goethals Hall housed the School of Technology (engineering) and adjoins the Mechanical Arts Building, Compton Hall. The six Gothic buildings are connected by a tunnel, which closed to public use in 1969.

(The Archway and north pedestrian arch over the north side of St. Nicholas Terrace was dismantled as the best as can be determined sometime around 1935-1937 when excavations were made to the grounds on the north side of St. Nicholas Terrace, former site of the Bowker Library, as shoring was being added to the library. The New York Landmarks Preservation Commission made the North Campus Quadrangle buildings and the College Gates official landmarks in 1981. The buildings in the Quadrangle were put on the State and National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In the summer of 2006, the historic gates on Convent Avenue were restored. =Postwar buildings= Contemporary and Gothic Revival architecture in the background Steinman Hall, which houses the School of Engineering, was erected in 1962 on the north end of the campus, on the site of the Bowker Library and the Drill Hall to replace the facilities in Compton Hall and Goethals Hall, and was named for David Barnard Steinman (CCNY Class of 1906), a well known civil engineer and bridge designer.\\"The Lost World of CCNY: Architectural Gems of Our Past: Architectural model of David B.

The Marshak Science Building was completed in 1971 on the site of the former Jasper Oval, an open space previously used as a football field. The building was named after Robert Marshak, renowned physicist and president of CCNY (1970‚Äì1979). The Marshak building houses all science labs and adjoins the Mahoney Gymnasium and its athletic facilities including a swimming pool and tennis courts.\\"Marshak Science Building CCNY\\" ‚Äì CCNY website North Academic Center (2011) In the 1970s, construction of the massive North Academic Center (NAC) was initiated. It was completed in 1984, and replaced Lewisohn Stadium and Klapper Hall. The NAC building houses hundreds of classrooms, two cafeterias, the Cohen Library, student lounges and centers, administrative offices, and a number of computer installations. Designed by architect John Carl Warnecke, the building has received criticism for its lack of design and outsize scale in comparison to the surrounding neighborhood. Within the NAC, a student lounge space was created outside the campus bookstore, and murals celebrating the history of the campus were painted on the doors of the undergraduate Student Government. Founded in 1869, it claims to be the oldest continuously operating student government organization in the country. =South Campus= In 1953, CCNY bought the campus of the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart (which, on a 1913 map, was shown as The Convent of the Sacred Heart), which added a south section to the campus. This expanded the campus to include many of the buildings in the area between 140th Street to 130th Street, from St. Nicholas Terrace in the east to Amsterdam Avenue in the west. Former buildings of the Manhattanville College campus to be used by CCNY were renamed for City College's purposes: Stieglitz Hall; Downer Hall; Wagner Hall, the prominent Finley Student Center, which contained the very active Buttenweiser Lounge; Eisner Hall; Park Gym; Mott Hall; and others. As a result of this expansion, the South Campus of CCNY primarily contained the liberal arts classes and departments of the College. The North Campus, also as a result of this expansion, mostly housed classes and departments for the sciences and engineering, as well as Klapper Hall (School of Education), and the Administration Building. In 1957, a new library building was erected in the middle of the campus, near 135th Street on the South Campus, and named Cohen Library, after Morris Raphael Cohen, an alumnus (Class of 1900) and celebrated professor of philosophy at the College from 1912 to 1938. When the Cohen Library moved to the North Academic Complex in the early 1980s, the structure was renamed the 'Y' building, and housed offices, supplies, the mail room, etc. The building was eventually gutted and renovated to become the home of the School of Architecture in 2009 (see below). In the 1970s, many of the old buildings of the South Campus\\"Aerial view of the South Campus, or Manhattanville Campus, taken prior to 1952\\" were demolished, some that had been used by the Academy of the Sacred Heart. The buildings remaining on the South Campus at this time were the Cohen Library (later moved into the North Academic Center), Park Gym (now the Structural Biology Research Center (NYSBC) ), Eisner Hall (built in 1941 by Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart as a library, later remodeled and housed CCNY's Art Department and named for the chairman of the Board of Higher Education in the 1930s),\\"The Lost World of CCNY: Architectural Gems of Our Past: Mark Eisner Hall\\" , CCNY Libraries Exhibitions website the Schiff House (former President's residence, now a child care center), and Mott Hall (formerly the English Department, now a New York City Department of Education primary school). Some of the buildings that were demolished at that time were Finley Hall (housed The Finley Student Center, student activities center, originally built in 1888‚Äì1890 as Manhattanville Academy's main building, and purchased in 1953 by City College),\\"The Lost World of CCNY: Architectural Gems of Our Past: John H.

New South Campus buildings Several new buildings were erected on the South Campus, including Aaron Davis Hall in 1981 and the Herman Goldman sports field in 1993. In August 2006, the College completed the construction of a 600-bed dormitory, called \\"The Towers.\\" There are plans to rename The Towers after a distinguished alumnus or donor. Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture The building that formerly housed Cohen Library, the \\"Y\\" building, became the new home for the School of Architecture, with the renovation headed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly. Near the 133rd Street gate, the Herman Goldman sports field was eliminated in favor of two new scientific education and research facilities. In 2007, two new buildings had been proposed for the South Campus site by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY). One was a four-story Science Building, to serve as an adjunct to the Marshak Science Building on the North Campus, and the other was a six-story Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC).\\"Dormitory Authority of the State of New York: The City College of New York Science Building and The City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center: Phases I and II Project\\", 2007. \\"Draft Environmental Impact Statement for The City College of New York Science Building and The City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center Project, Borough of Manhattan, New York County, New York (December 21, 2007)\\", The Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, December 21, 2007.\\"Fall 2009 CCNY Campus Map with proposed additions\\" , Integrated Global Water Cycle Observations (IGWCO) Workshop and Meeting, Feb 23‚Äì26, 2010 at CCNY.

The building was designed by James Renwick, Jr. and was located at Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street in Gramercy Park. According to some sources, it was the first Gothic Revival college building on the East Coast.\\"Free Academy Building (1849‚Äì1927)\\", The Lost World of CCNY: Architectural Gems of Our Past, CCNY Libraries Renwick's building was demolished in 1928, and replaced in 1930 with a 16-story structure that is part of the present-day Baruch College campus. Lewisohn Stadium The former Adolph Lewisohn Stadium, now the site of the North Academic Center (1915) In the early 1900s, after most of the Gothic campus had been built, CCNY President John H. Finley wanted the college to have a stadium to replace the existing inadequate facilities. New York City did not provide the money needed to build a stadium, but donated two city blocks south of the campus which were open park land. In 1912, businessman and philanthropist Adolph Lewisohn donated $75,000 for the stadium's construction and Finley commissioned architect Arnold W. Brunner to design Lewisohn Stadium.\\"Old Postcard: (Lewisohn) Stadium of the City College of New York\\", CCNY Libraries exhibitions website Lewisohn Stadium was built as a 6,000-seat stadium, with thousands more seats available on the infield during concerts, and was dedicated on May 29, 1915, two years after Dr. Finley had left his post at the college. College graduation services were held in Lewisohn for many years, with the last graduation held in 1973 shortly before it was demolished. Deep under the grandstand seats was the college rifle range, used by ROTC students for basic handling of firearms. Other demolished buildings A separate library building originally planned in 1912 for the campus was never built but ground was broken on March 25, 1927 for a free-standing library to be built on St. Nicholas Terrace, between St. Nicholas and 141st Streets. Only 1/5 of the original library plan was constructed at a cost of $850,000, far above the $150,000 alumni had collected to establish a library at the original Amsterdam Avenue and 140th Street site.

The five schools of the City College of New York are The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, which is divided into four divisions (The Division of Humanities and the Arts, The Division of Social Science, The Division of Science, and The Division of Interdisciplinary Studies at City College Downtown, 25 Broadway), The Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture, The School of Education, The Grove School of Engineering, and The Sophie B. Davis School of Biomedical Education. The college offers the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S. Ed.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.), Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degrees at the undergraduate level, and the Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Science in Education (M.S.Ed.), Master of Engineering (M.E.), Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.), Master of Architecture (M.Arch.), Master of Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.), Master of Urban Planning (M.U.P.), Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.), Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees at the graduate level. For the fall 2016 entering class of freshman, the average SAT score was 1260/1600 and the average high school GPA was 90/100%. =Rankings= U.S. News & World Report in its 2016 rankings placed CCNY 85th among 620 Regional Universities in the North. (\\"Regional Universities\\" are defined as institutions that offer a broad range of undergraduate programs, some master's degree but few, if any, doctoral programs. CUNY uses the CUNY Graduate Center for its doctoral programs). CCNY also ranked #1 for racial and ethnic diversity among Regional Universities in the North.

Three of its alumni went on to become Nobel laureates in physics: Robert Hofstadter in 1961, Arno Penzias in 1978, and Leon Lederman in 1988. Albert Einstein gave the first of his series of United States lectures at the City College of New York in 1921. Other distinguished alumni and past faculty in the field are Mark Zemansky, Clarence Zener, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Myriam Sarachik and Leonard Susskind. Current faculty include Robert Alfano and Michio Kaku. Research =Advanced Science Research Center= CCNY hosts a research center focusing on nanotechnology, structural biology, photonics, neuroscience and environmental sciences. =CUNY Dominican Studies Institute= Part of CCNY's Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership, the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute is the nation's only university-based research center devoted to \\"the history of the Dominican Republic and people of Dominican descent in the United States and across the wider Dominican diaspora.\\" College seal and medal logo The design of the three-faced college seal has its roots in the 19th century, when Professor Charles Anthon was inspired by views of Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, whose two faces connect the past and the future. He broadened this image of Janus into three faces to show the student, and consequently, knowledge, developing from childhood through youth into maturity. The seal was redesigned for the college's Centennial Medal in 1947 by Albert P. d'Andrea (class of 1918).Townsend Harris Medal Winners , CCNY website. Cf. Albert P. D'Andrea entry.\\"Albert P. D'Andrea: sculpted relief portrait of Townsend Harris\\" , CCNY Exhibitions website. Professor d'Andrea, having immigrated from Benevento, Italy, in 1901, joined the faculty immediately after graduation and was Professor of Art and Chairman of the Art Department from 1948 to 1968. In 2003, the college decided to create a logo distinct from its seal, with the stylized text \\"the City College of New York.\\" Athletics Olympic gold medalist Henry Wittenberg was co-captain of the CCNY wrestling team in 1939 during his undergraduate studies. After participating in two Olympics, he then taught wrestling at CCNY. In 1977, he was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. CCNY is the only team in men's college basketball history to win both the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Tournament in the same year (1950). However, this accomplishment was overshadowed by the CCNY point shaving scandal in which seven CCNY basketball players were arrested in 1951 for taking money from gamblers to affect the outcome of games. The scandal led to the decline of CCNY from a national powerhouse in Division I basketball to a member of Division III, and damaged the national profile of college basketball in general. From 1934 until 1941, future NFL Hall of Famer Benny Friedman was the football coach at City College. In 1938, future four-time Olympican Daniel Bukantz was the intercollegiate foil champion. Future Olympian James Strauch fenced for CCNY, graduating in 1942. In 1948, future Olympian Abram Cohen was a member of the NCAA Champion CCNY team. That same year future five-time Olympian Albert Axelrod was U.S. Intercollegiate Fencing Association and NCAA Champion in foil. Harold Goldsmith, a future three-time Olympian, won the 1952 NCAA foil championship while at CCNY. The College currently fields nine men's teams (Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Indoor/Outdoor Track and Field, Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball) and eight women's varsity athletic teams (Basketball, Cross Country, Fencing, Indoor/Outdoor Track and Field, Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball). The Department also offers a men's Lacrosse club. The Beavers have won 1 NCAA Division I championship (Men's Basketball) and over 70 City University of New York Athletic Conference (CUNYAC) Championships since 1966. The Beavers have won 2 Division III Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Championships in the program's history: Men's Volleyball and Women's Basketball. The Beavers also have a successful history in NCAA Division III Track and Field. The Lady Beavers have placed within the top 3 multiple times, 5 times for Indoor Women, 2 times for Outdoor Women. The Men's and Women's Track teams combined have over 25 All-Americans since 1980. Art The City College of New York and its resident art collection were founded in 1847. The collection contains roughly one thousand eight hundred works of art ranging from the historical to the contemporary. There were two major points in the college's history when most of the artwork in the collection was obtained; the first was at the founding of the institution and the second was in the 1970s when much of the campus underwent renovation and expansion. Also a larger portion of the collection was obtained through donations and Percent for Art, a program established in 1982 to offer New York City agencies the opportunity to acquire or commission artwork for properties owned by the City of New York. There is currently no art museum at City College, thus much of the collection is not on view for the student population or public. The collection includes works by Edwin Howland Blashfield, Walter Pach, Charles Alston, Raphael Soyer, Louis Lozowick, Stephen Parrish, Paul Adolphe Rajon, Mariano Fortuny, Marilyn Bridges, Lucien Clergue, Elliott Erwitt, Andreas Feininger, Harold Feinstein, Larry Fink, Sally Gall, Ralph Gibson, Jerome Liebling, Robert Mapplethorpe, Mary Ellen Mark, Joel Meyerowitz, Dorothy Norman and Gilles Peress. The drawings, prints and photos which comprise the collection are housed within the libraries as a part of the City College archive, where individuals can make appointments to view the works. Some notable works from the collection include several Keith Haring prints and Edward Curtis's The North American Indian. Student involvement with the collection is minimum but there is some. At the moment graduate students in museum studies are working to develop an inventory of the collection. There are times when they host small exhibitions of works in the collection but there is no allotted gallery space for this. Undergraduate students mostly interact with the collection through their classes; aside from that most of their experiences with this collection come from the public sculptures around campus.

The NR-40 (from , nozh razvedchika meaning 'scout's knife') was a Soviet combat knife introduced in 1940 and used throughout World War II. The NR-40 has a 152 mm blade with a clip point, a large ricasso, a black wooden handle, and an S-shaped guard. The guard is \\"inverted\\" (unlike most S-shaped guards, it curves towards the edge) because standard Soviet Army grips called for holding the knife with the edge upwards.  History  Tank crew members, the \\"black knife\\" division. Note all-black NR-40s. In the beginning of the 20th century, Finnish puukko knives started becoming popular with criminals in most cities of the Russian Empire. Local knife-makers then began modifying the Finnish woodsman's tool to make it more useful for fighting; for example, making the blade longer, changing from a flat back to a clip point, and adding a large guard. The resulting weapon, still called a \\"Finnish knife\\" or \\"finka\\" in Russian, looked rather different from a typical puukko. \\"Finnish knives\\" were ubiquitous in the criminal underworld of Russia and Soviet Union throughout the first half of the 20th century. Because of the criminal association, the \\"Finnish knife\\" was banned in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, much like the switchblade would later be banned in the West. The Winter War revealed a number of deficiencies in Soviet weaponry; among other issues, the Soviet infantry lacked a good combat knife. As a result, in 1940, the Soviet Army adopted the NR-40 ‚Äì essentially, a mass- produced version of the Russian gangster's \\"finka\\".  \\"Black knife\\" division  NR-40 was mostly produced at the ZiK (–ó–∏–ö) factory in Zlatoust, Urals. Once the Ural Volunteer Tank Corps was formed in 1943, all its soldiers and officers were supplied with a special issue of NR-40 (also known as \\"black knife\\"). The formation was later named by Germans as ¬´Schwarzmesser Panzer- Division¬ª. The unofficial divisional anthem mentioned the nickname as well (\\"–î–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è —á–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–æ–∂–µ–π\\", Black Knife Division).  Modern variants of NR-40  NR-40 is no longer used by the army, but modern remakes and almost exact replicas of NR-40 are produced in Zlatoust to this day. A knife of exactly the same proportions would be legally a weapon, thus prohibiting free sale. To circumvent that, producers either use a thinner blade or remove the guard.

He was the first president of the World Anti-Doping Agency and vice-president of the International Olympic Committee. Pound is a staunch advocate of strict drug testing for athletes, and has made many allegations of cheating and official corruption, some of them challenged, owing to disputes over the testing and reporting procedures. Time magazine featured him as one of the \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\". He was a chancellor of McGill University and was chairman of the board of Olympic Broadcasting Services. Early life and education Pound was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, the eldest of four children. His father was an engineer at a pulp-and-paper mill, and the family moved often. His family moved to numerous Quebec towns, including La Tuque and Trois Rivieres. When Pound was six, his family moved to Ocean Falls, British Columbia. He later moved to Montreal in 1957 and attended Mount Royal High School in Mount Royal, Quebec.The McGill flag on the Arts Building, McGill University In addition to swimming, Pound was a squash player and won the Canadian intercollegiate championship twice. In 1962, he earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from McGill University and was on the Dean's List. One of his classmates was John Cleghorn. He received a licentiate in accounting from McGill in 1964 and got his chartered accountant designation the same year. He received a B.A. with honours from Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in 1963 and graduated from the McGill University Faculty of Law with a B.C.L. in 1967. During his time at McGill, he swam for the McGill Redmen from 1958 to 1962 and from 1964 to 1967. He established school records in every freestyle event, winning three Canadian intercollegiate gold medals in each of his freshman, sophomore and senior years. He was honoured by the Scarlet Key Society and was awarded the Carswell Company Prize. He served as managing editor of the McGill Law Journal. Career =Swimming= Pound won the Canadian freestyle championship four times (1958, 1960, 1961, and 1962) and the Canadian butterfly championship in 1961. He competed for Canada at the 1959 Pan American Games in Chicago and the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where he finished sixth in the 100 meter freestyle and was fourth with the 4 √ó 100 m relay team. He won one gold, two silver, and one bronze medals at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia and set a Commonwealth record in the 110 yd freestyle. =Canadian Olympic Committee= After Pound retired from competitive swimming, he served as secretary of the Canadian Olympic Committee in 1968. He became president of the organization from 1977 to 1982. =Olympics= In 1978, Pound was elected to the International Olympic Committee and put in charge of negotiating television and sponsorship deals. He was on the IOC executive committee for 16 years, as vice-president from 1987 to 1991 and again from 1996 to 2000, and was a one-time candidate for the presidency of the organization. Pound revolutionized the Olympic movement using such deals to transform the IOC into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. He became known as an outspoken critic of corruption within the IOC, while at the same time supporting the leadership of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. His criticisms were given a wide airing after the scandals surrounding the Salt Lake City Olympics broke, and he was then appointed head of the inquiry into the corruption. He also campaigned vehemently for stronger drug testing. With the retirement of Samaranch in 2001, he ran for president of the IOC, but the IOC chose Belgian Jacques Rogge. Pound finished third behind South Korean Kim Un-Yong, who was one of those found to have participated in the Salt Lake City scandals, and who was later prosecuted by the South Korean government. On April 4, 2014, he was appointed chairman of the board of Olympic Broadcasting Services. =World Anti-Doping Agency= Pound scaled back his involvement with the IOC. He helped found World Anti-Doping Agency, based in Montreal, and became the organization's first president. In that role he oversaw an unprecedented toughening of the drug-testing regimen. Pound was an especially harsh critic of the Americans, arguing that there is widespread doping, especially amongst their track and field team. He also worked to expand WADA beyond the Olympics, calling on the major sports leagues to agree to WADA scrutiny. His allegations of widespread doping in professional bicycle racing at times brought WADA into fierce public conflict with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). Pound's term as WADA president ended at the end of 2007; he chose not to run for another term. Pound chaired a commission investigating doping in Russia in track and field (athletics). The commission released its report in November 2015, accusing the Russian state of being complicit in illegal doping, requesting suspension of the Russian Athletics Federation, suspending RUSADA and firing its director and declaring it was rife with corruption, and accusing Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko of cover-ups. The report released by Pound's commission instigated an INTERPOL investigation. The commission's investigation also involved Russia's FSB spying on RUSADA during the Sochi Olympics. =Law= He is a partner in the law firm of Stikeman Elliott LLP in Montreal. He practises tax law. He is also the author of several books on legal history. He edits Pound‚Äôs Tax Case Notes, a review of tax-law court cases for lawyers. He did much of the reading of cases and the writing of the notes on international airplane flights to and from International Olympic Committee functions. Controversies =NHL= Discussing the National Hockey League in November 2005, Pound said, \\"you wouldn‚Äôt be far wrong if you said a third of hockey players are gaining some pharmaceutical assistance.\\"\\"Dick Pound slams NHL's drug policy\\", CBC Sports, January 19, 2006. Pound would later admit that he completely invented the figure. Both the NHL and NHLPA have denied the claims, demanding Pound provide evidence rather than make what they term unsubstantiated claims. Since his comments were made, some NHL players have tested positive for banned substances, including Bryan Berard, Jos√© Th√©odore, and two of 250 players involved in Olympic testing. As of June 2006, there had been 1,406 tests in the program jointly administered by the league and the union, and none has come up with banned substances under NHL rules. Pound remained skeptical, claiming the NHL rules were too lax and unclear, as they do not test for some banned substance, including certain stimulants.\\"Pound: NHL doping results meaningless,\\" Canadian Press, June 13, 2006. In an interview with hockey blogger, B. D. Gallof, of Hockeybuzz on December 19, 2007, Pound was asked to expand on the 30% comment and subsequent reaction, expounded that stimulants was \\"the NHL's drug of choice\\". He also cited that the NHL will have no credibility on a drug policy if it, and other sports, continue to run things \\"in-house\\".\\",\\" Hockeybuzz, December 19, 2007. =Lance Armstrong= In January 2004, Le Monde quoted Pound as saying that \\"the public knows that the riders in the Tour de France and the others are doping.\\" This prompted a strongly worded rebuke from Lance Armstrong, who called Pound's comments \\"careless and unacceptable.\\" Pound said he was surprised by the personal nature of Armstrong's response because he had never mentioned the cyclist by name. Around the same time, scientists at a French lab were using frozen urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France to find a new way of detecting erythropoietin (EPO), an oxygen-boosting agent. The samples did not have names attached to them, only numbers, and were provided for research purposes only. But an article in the August 23, 2005 edition of L'√âquipe reported finding documentation linking the numbers with the riders, with the findings from the research with samples linked to Armstrong, claiming that six of his 15 samples showed traces of EPO. Pound told the media that there was \\"now an onus on Lance Armstrong and the others to explain how it is EPO got into their systems.\\" The Union Cycliste Internationale launched an enquiry, led by lawyer Emile Vrijman, former head of the Netherlands‚Äô antidoping agency (and later defense lawyer of athletes accused of doping). In his 132-page report, leaked to the media on May 31, 2006, Vrijman said no proper records were kept of the samples and that there had been no chain of custody and no process to ensure that the samples had not been spiked with banned substances at the laboratory. The report was highly critical of WADA and Pound, concluding that they had specifically targeted Armstrong and the UCI. The report also called for an investigation to \\"focus on the communications between Dick Pound and the media\\" and recommended that no disciplinary action be taken against any athletes. In response, Pound dismissed the Vrijman report as \\"so lacking in professionalism and objectivity that it borders on farcical.\\"\\"Wada boss slams Armstrong 'farce'\\", BBC Sport, June 2, 2006. WADA released an official statement, criticising the Vrijman report as biased, ill-informed, speculative, and \\"fallacious in many aspects.\\" On June 9, 2006, Armstrong sent an eight-page letter to Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, demanding that action be taken against Pound. He wrote that Pound was guilty of \\"reprehensible and indefensible\\" behaviour and \\"must be suspended or expelled from the Olympic movement\\". In February 2007, the IOC ethics committee recommended that Pound exercise greater prudence in his public pronouncements. It declined to move toward removing Pound as an IOC member, and found it had no jurisdiction over WADA. In response, Pound said he was accountable to WADA, not to the IOC. In 2013 Armstrong admitted that he had taken banned substances.https://www.espn.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/8855686/lance- armstrong-admits-doping-interview-oprah-winfrey =\\"Savages\\" comment= On August 9, 2008, during a conversation in French, when asked about whether the IOC was embarrassed to be affiliated with Chinese government's recent political history, he was quoted as replying: \\"We must not forget that 400 years ago, Canada was a land of savages, with scarcely 10,000 inhabitants of European origin, while in China, we're talking about a 5,000-year-old civilization.\\" Two months later, the Aboriginal advocacy group LandInSights asked for him to be suspended from the International Olympic Committee for the remark. Pound responded that it was a clumsy remark that was taken out of context, and that in the particular French expression used, \\"un pays de sauvages\\", the French sauvages was not equivalent to English \\"savages\\". Personal life Dick Pound resides in Westmount, Quebec, with his second wife, Montreal author Julie Keith. He has three children from his first marriage and two stepchildren from his second. Honours In 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and in 1993 was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 2014, Pound was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada. Pound was awarded the Gold and Silver Star of the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the government of Japan in 1998. In 2005, Time magazine featured him as one of the \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\". In 2008, he won the Laureus Spirit of Sport Award for his work at WADA.2008 Laureus World Sports Awards Winners  Laureus He is the Honorary Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG). In 2010, he was inducted into McGill University's Sports Hall of Fame. Pound joined McGill University's board of governors in 1986 and was elected chair in 1994. He served as Chancellor of McGill University from July 1, 1999 to 2009. Published works    See also * List of Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming (men) References External links *Richard W.

He has also worked on collaborative projects with Approach (Al Japro) and iD (The Find). During this period an internship with Sub Verse Music led Miles becoming more acquainted with the New York independent hip hop scene, which informed his ability to later start his own label, INnatesounds. =Soundsgood= Additionally, he co- founded the hip-hop group SoundsGood in 2000 with Kansas City-based rapper Joe Good. In the early years of SoundsGood the group was well known in the \\"house party\\" scene. After the pair released a 12-song eponymous debut LP in 2002, they released Biscuits & Gravy in 2005. Miles released an instrumental version of Biscuits & Gravy in 2007, after Joe Good had left the hip-hop scene. In 2008, Miles released another SoundsGood LP using material recorded between the band's debut and Biscuits. =Recent years (2005-present)= Miles moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 2005. That year he produced the track \\"Comin For You\\" for rap artist Reach, which was chosen by a panel of judges including DJ Premier for Scion's NextUp competition. That same year he received international recognition in Scratch Magazine's Hydrosonic's section. In 2006, Miles released his debut solo project, Smell Smoke? According to The Pitch, the main single from the album, \\"Miles Gets Open,\\" is a \\"soulful, jazzy tune, on which Bonny himself plays trumpet, showcases his jazz upbringing in New Jersey, where his father, now a woodworker, used to work nights as a musician across the river in New York City.\\" In 2007 he produced and recorded for musicians such as Reggie B, Deep Thinkers, and John Brewer, all of whom are members of the hip-hop collective Innate Sounds. That year he also made the beat for \\"Call Me Francois\\" on Sage Francis' album Human the Death Dance, released on Epitaph Records. He released the \\"Miles Gets Open\\" 7\\" & Closer Love EP in conjunction with the German-based Melting Pot Music in 2007. Miles' next work, Steveland, was released on December 15, 2007, and is a five-song album with Miles singing and playing the horns over a 2002 tribute to Stevie Wonder by indie producer Madlib. In 2010, he won the Pitch Music Award for DJ Hip-Hop in Kansas City. Bonny released Egg Black EP with producer B.Lewis on April 3, 2012, and he was nominated for a 2013 Amadeus Award (Austria) for his S3 project. He has performed internationally in countries such as Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, and Austria. Personal life In 2013 Bonny moved to Tres Piedras, New Mexico.

It can be considered a new Greek organization that is awaiting official recognition from their international headquarters to maintain a chapter on their college‚Äôs campus. A group wishing to become a member of a fraternity or sorority must first petition for status as a colony. The entire membership of the colony remains as uninitiated associates, usually learning and operating under the guidance of an advisor from the national organization and/or from a sponsoring chapter. If the colony prospers and meets its goals as set out by the national organization, the colony may later be chartered and the membership initiated. After this the sorority or fraternity will become a full chapter of the fraternity. This practice varies with different sororities and fraternities; however, many of them follow procedures and practices very similar to one another. Everything depends on the official nationals of each individual organization. History The first Greek society was Phi Beta Kappa and was founded in 1776 as a literary and debating club. The oldest social fraternity is the Kappa Alpha Society, formed at Union College in New York in 1825. This fraternity was soon followed by several others in the following years. Several other Greek organizations were formed through the twentieth century. With each separate sorority and fraternity, others began to charter existing organizations at different schools. This became popular in the 1900s, especially after World War II and the Great Depression. Practices and procedures Different Greek organizations have different practices and procedures when establishing colonies and maturing them into chapters. Not only does this process depend on the specific Greek organization, but it also depends on the standards and rules that are set by each individual university. However, many organizations have a process that is similar to this: # A group of men or women must contact the organization‚Äôs nationals to request the colonization of the organization. After the request is evaluated and approved, these men and women will be considered the Founding Fathers or Founding Sisters of that Greek organization. # Typically, it takes anywhere from eighteen months to thirty-six months for the entire process to take place. Within these two years the colony must be able to effectively prove to the national organization that they will be able to operate efficiently in all areas of chapter operations. These areas include philanthropy, payments, and recruiting and maintaining members consistently. # After the colony has proven to the nationals that they can maintain their chapter, the men or women of the organization are then initiated into the desired Fraternity or Sorority by the national organization. Alumni volunteers will work with the colony to establish effective chapter operations, develop scholarship programs, teach recruitment skills and devise a long-term plan of action. For most Greek organizations, there is a good chance that there are at least several alumni near the given school. Most sororities or fraternities get into contact with these alumni through their nationals. Nationals also sends what can be referred to as \\"Education Consultants,\\" who are paid by the organization, to spend time with the colony to teach them all of the traditions, values and ways of the fraternity or sorority. Staff members from nationals are also always on duty to assist the colony in any way needed so that they become successful. Role as a colony As a colony, most universities allow the members to participate in all Greek activities on campus. These activities include the Interfraternity Council, or IFC; Panhellenic Council, or PHC; student government, new-student orientation; intramural athletics; leadership honoraries and other such activities. These activities can give colony members an opportunity to get established in their university‚Äôs Greek community and meet potential new members that later could join their colony or chapter.

It is located in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, in the West Island region of the Island of Montreal. The property is also the home of John Abbott College.  History  Macdonald College under construction, 1906 The main building in the 1940s Construction began in 1905, and the school opened its doors to students in 1907 as the Macdonald College of McGill University. Planned and funded completely by Sir William Macdonald, who also provided a $2 million operating endowment, it was designed by architects Alexander Cowper Hutchison and George W. Wood. James Wilson Robertson served as its first principal, and oversaw its construction and hired its first staff. Robertson eventually came into conflict with Mcdonald and following budgetary restrictions in 1909, resigned from this position in 1910. Several buildings on the downtown McGill campus were also funded by Sir William Macdonald and designed by the Montreal-based architect Andrew Taylor, including the Macdonald Physics Building (1893), Redpath Library (1893), Macdonald Engineering Building (1907), and the Strathcona Medical Building (1907)‚Äîsince renamed the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building. Far surpassing the Ontario Agricultural College, Macdonald College was the largest in Canada and in its day was one of the most modern agricultural colleges in the world. After two years of planning and construction, the college opened in the fall of 1907 under principal James Wilson Robertson. In 1938, the Rural Adult Education Service of Macdonald College was established. In 1943, John W. McConnell purchased an adjacent of farmland and donated it to the college, increasing the property's size to its current . In 1965, it became the Macdonald Campus of McGill University. Students studying at Macdonald Campus can earn internationally recognized degrees at both the undergraduate - B.Sc.(Agr) - and graduate level in the fields of agriculture, food, natural sciences, applied economics, environment, and engineering. In 1971, McGill leased a portion of the Macdonald Campus to the newly created John Abbott College, vacating many historic buildings for the CEGEP. This coincided with McGill's decision to move the Faculty of Education to the downtown campus. In 2002, this portion of the campus was permanently sold to John Abbott College. On September 26, 2006, Canada Post issued a special commemorative stamp in honour of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the college.  Programs  The Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (FAES) and the School of Human Nutrition are located on McGill University's Macdonald Campus. The campus comprises 650 hectares in a waterfront setting on the western tip of the island of Montreal. The faculty offers: * Certificate in Ecological Agriculture * Bachelor of Science in Agriculture; Bachelor of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences in Agricultural Science with option in International Agriculture; Bachelor of Science Agriculture Science in Agricultural Science with option in Ecological Agriculture The faculty offers a variety of degree programs at the undergraduate level leading to a B.Sc. degree in either Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (AgEnvSc), Food Science (FoodSc) or Nutritional Sciences (NutrSci), or a B.Eng degree in Bioresource Engineering (BREE). In addition, M.Sc., M.Sc. Applied and Ph.D. programs are offered in the areas of Agricultural Sciences, Biological Sciences, Bioresource Engineering, Biotechnology, Environmental Sciences, Food Science, and Nutritional Sciences. The Faculty offers some Graduate Certificates and Diplomas. The Faculty also offers some post-baccalaureate certificates: Certificate in Ecological Agriculture, Certificate in Food Science and Diploma in the Environment.  Coat of arms  Canadian philanthropist Sir William Macdonald The Macdonald Campus coat of arms honours Sir William Macdonald, the major benefactor of McGill's agricultural college: The colour of the field (gold) and the arm holding a cross (red) are from the second quarter of the arms of Sir William Macdonald, the tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist, who founded the College. His armorial bearings derived from the fact that he was a grandson of John, eighth Macdonald of Glenaladale. Until the 1930s, Macdonald College used Sir William's achievement as one quarter of the College arms. The two red martlets and the open book with its motto are from the arms of McGill University. The clover leaves (also gold) signify fertility and their three segments suggest the three purposes of the Campus, i.e. agriculture, service and food.Koorengevel, Ben \\"McGill University\\", \\"Montreal flags\\", 2000.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Montreal West in 1792 and was appointed to the Executive Council of Lower Canada in 1793. He was the honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of the 1st Battalion, Montreal Militia, a predecessor unit of The Canadian Grenadier Guards. He was also a prominent member of the Ch√¢teau Clique and one of the original founding members of the Beaver Club. His summer home stood within the Golden Square Mile.  Biography  Statue of James McGill on the university's downtown campus. The McGill family originated in Ayrshire and had been living in Glasgow for two generations by the time James was born at the family home on Stockwell Street. The McGills were metalworkers and, from 1715 onward, burgesses of the city and members of the Hammermen's Guild, James' father having served as deacon.James McGill of Montreal (1995), by Stanley Frost James McGill was educated at the University of Glasgow, and soon afterwards left for North America to explore the business opportunities there. By 1766, he was in Montreal, whose trade opportunities had recently been laid open following the British Conquest of New France. He entered the fur trade south of the Great Lakes, at first as a clerk or agent for the Quebec merchant, William Grant of St. Roch.A. C. Flick, ed., The Papers of Sir William Johnson, vol. 12 (Albany, 1957), pp. 194-5. By the next year, the firm of \\"James McGill & Co.\\" was trading at Michilimackinac.D A. Armour, ed., Treason? at Michilimackinac (Mackinac Island: Mackinac State Historic Parks, 1967), p. 88; Lart, Canadian Historical Review, vol. 3 (1922), p. 355 In 1773, McGill joined with Isaac Todd (who would remain a close lifelong friend) in a trading venture beyond Grand Portage, which was renewed under the name Todd & McGill in 1776.Letters, Todd to Edgar, in Edgar Papers (photostats), Library & Archives Canada, MG19 A1, pp. 393, 523. This partnership was important in the formation of what would become the North West Company. Todd & McGill prospered, as one of the main firms supplied by the London commission merchant, John Strettell. The partnership did not participate in the North West Company after 1783, but it continued in the so-called \\"Southwest trade\\" in the Mississippi valley until Michilimackinac was handed over to the Americans in 1796. It was also involved in other enterprises, but few business papers have survived, making a detailed account difficult. In November 1775, McGill was a member of the representation for the citizens of Montreal at the drafting of the articles of capitulation for the city to the invading American army.Verreau, L'Abb√©. Invasion du Canada: Collection de memoires. (Montreal: Eus√®be Sen√©cal, 1873), 81. McGill was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Montreal West in 1792 and appointed to the Executive Council in 1793. He was elected again in 1800 and in Montreal East in 1804. He was the first honorary lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Battalion, Montreal Militia, a unit which later evolved into the Canadian Grenadier Guards, as commemorated by the replicated cairn that stands before the Arts building of McGill University.

Educated at the Ursuline Convent, Quebec, she was the daughter of Guillaume Guillimin (1713-1750), Member of the Sovereign Council of New France and Judge of the Courts of Admiralty. Her mother, Marie-Genevi√®ve Foucault, was the daughter of Fran√ßois Foucault (1690-1766), the owner of one of the largest seigneuries in New France and a member of the Sovereign Council. McGill had previously adopted Charlotte, the youngest daughter of his deceased friend John Porteous, and through his marriage (after the death of their uncle and legal guardian) he became the step-father of two sons, * Lt.-Col. Fran√ßois-Amable Trottier Desrivi√®res (1764-1830), J.P., was particularly close to McGill and became like a son to him, following him into business with the firm of McGill & Todd.

McGill purchased a commission for him into the 60th Royal American Regiment, but he predeceased his step-father in a \\"foolish\\" duel fought with a fellow German officer while on service in Jamaica. When the German boasted of his death to Desrivi√®res' friend, Charles de Salaberry, after finishing his breakfast, the French-Canadian challenged the German. After a long, obstinate contest fought with swords, the much younger de Salaberry killed the \\"rough bully\\" who had murdered his friend.Canadian history and biography, and passages in the lives of a British Prince and a Canadian Seigneur. By William James Anderson Desrivi√®res had married the sister of Joseph Bouchette and was the father of James McGill Trottier Desrivi√®res, who inherited ¬£60,000 from McGill and married a daughter of Joseph Frobisher.James McGill of Montreal (1995), by Stanley Frost In 1777, at Montreal, McGill purchased the former home of the Baron de Becancourt for his new family on Notre-Dame Street, next to the Ch√¢teau Ramezay.James McGill of Montreal (1995), by Stanley Brice Frost In about 1797, he was said to have purchased the farm he called Burnside which he used as a summer home. Burnside was near a farm belonging to the Desrivi√®res family to the east, and the McTavish estate to the north and west. A burn ran through the property, from which McGill gave it its name. The land was used for orchards, vegetable farming and cattle-grazing. In 1787, an elm took root in the upper meadow of Burnside which grew into the Founder's Elm and survived until 1976 when it became dangerous and had to be felled. Burnside was a gentleman's country house as opposed to a working farmhouse. The ground floor was taken up with servants' rooms, with a kitchen at the front and cellars going into the hill at the back. Steps led up to the front door and into the entrance hall with spacious front rooms on either side. Each of the two front rooms had three windows facing south. The high sloping roof had dormer windows for the third floor rooms, of which only two (each measuring twenty four square feet) had ceilings, while the rest of the area was a large open attic.McGill University: For the Advancement of Learning 1801-1895, by Stanley Brice Frost Legacy McGill University, Montreal A fur trader, slave owner and land owner, McGill further diversified his activities into land speculation and the timber trade. By 1810, he had abandoned the fur trade altogether. At his death, he was one of the richest men in Montreal, leaving an estate well in excess of ¬£100,000. The executors of his will were all close personal friends: John Richardson, Bishop John Strachan, Chief Justice James Reid and James Dunlop. McGill's major assets included real estate in Lower and Upper Canada and investments in Britain; the latter not specified as to character or amount. There were also extensive mortgage holdings. In his will, old friends were remembered, the Montreal poor, the H√¥tel-Dieu de Montr√©al, the Grey Nuns, the H√¥pital-G√©n√©ral de Qu√©bec and two Glasgow charities. Even though Alexander Henry grumbled that McGill's fortune, \\"went to strangers... (and) his wife's children, Mrs McGill is left comfortable, but young Desrivi√®res (the son of McGill's youngest stepson) will have ¬£60,000\\".Canada's Entrepreneurs : From the Fur Trade to the 1929 Stock Market Crash : Portraits from the Dictionary of Canadian Biography; Directors John English and R√©al B√©langer; University of Toronto Press; 2011. This plaque commemorates the location of the house in which James McGill, founder of McGill University, was born. It is located on Stockwell Street in Glasgow. McGill's most important legacy was the ¬£10,000 and his summer home that he left to the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning. The bequest not only funded McGill University, but it also stretched to establish several other colleges and universities, including the University of British Columbia, which was known as the McGill University College of British Columbia until 1915; the University of Victoria, an affiliated junior college of McGill until 1916; and, Dawson College which began in 1945 as a satellite campus of McGill to absorb the anticipated influx of students after World War II. James McGill was buried, alongside his fur-trading associate John Porteous, in the old Protestant \\"Dufferin Square Cemetery\\". When the cemetery was eradicated in 1875, his remains were reinterred in front of the Arts Building on the McGill University campus. Plaques are displayed on Stockwell Street, Glasgow commemorating his birthplace and his foundation of the university, and in the undercroft of Bute Hall at the University of Glasgow, recognizing the historic link between Glasgow and McGill universities. McGill Primary School in Pollok, Glasgow, was named after James McGill. It is now closed.

This may include reviews of newly released guitars, amplifiers and other equipment; interviews with famous and up-and-coming guitar players; and features on the guitar industry, news articles, playing technique with tablature. Guitarists slogan was previously \\"The Guitar Player's Bible\\", before changing in 2012 to \\"The Guitar Magazine\\". In the June 2014 edition, Guitarist celebrated its 30th Anniversary.  Gear reviews  One of the key features of Guitarist is its large and in-depth gear reviews section, which is produced by some of the most respected and experienced guitar writers in the world, including Dave Burrluck, Neville Marten and Mick Taylor. The gear aspect of the magazine covers reviews of all the latest guitar equipment from major and boutique makers from around the world. As well as electric guitars and acoustic guitars, the magazine also reviews guitar amplifiers, effects pedals, electric basses and various pro- audio and recording equipment applicable to guitar players. Gear reviews within the magazine comprise two distinct elements. First Play reviews are located near the front of the magazine and generally focus on high-end products. These reviews place an emphasis on the high-quality, artistic photography the mag prides itself for, but often will not go into the same level of forensic detail as reviews elsewhere in Guitarist. The second type of review featured in the magazine are the Feature Reviews, located in the back half of each issue. These reviews are designed to go in-depth on new and interesting gear, and also go behind the scenes, talking to the people involved in the creation of the instruments, or explore the history of that instrument in a more feature-like way. Where applicable, all the gear reviewed in Guitarist is accompanied by a video demo of that product, produced by the magazine's in-house team - often the product will be demoed by the reviewer himself. These demos can be either a straight up demonstration of the product's features, a short piece of original music created using the product in question, or occasionally, a talking-head discussion of the guitar on show between members of the Guitarist team, with playing examples interspersed throughout. These video demos were previously accessed via the Guitarist CD/DVD, or the online Guitarist Vault download archive. From 2014, however, the video demos have been available as a private YouTube playlist, accessed via a direct link printed in each issue. In addition to gear reviews, each issue also features an in-depth Q&A; section, where reader's technical queries and problems are answered by Guitarist's experts, as well as a long-term test section, where members of the Guitarist team take recently reviewed products on a six-month trial to see how they feature in the real world.  Features and artists  Guitarist has primarily always focussed on blues, folk and classic rock and metal when it comes to interviews and features. While that remains its core, in recent years the title has broadened its scope to include artists from a wide array of guitar-focussed genres, including alternative rock, modern metal, progressive rock, jazz, country, shred guitar and many others. Artist interviews in Guitarist are focussed on famous or noteworthy guitar players, and interviews are conducted from a more 'guitar' point of view than a regular music magazine interview - discussions of the artist in question's playing style, gear choices and general attitude to the guitar are commonplace. Occasionally, Guitarist will get the artist in question to either demonstrate their gear or playing on video, which is then available to view on the Guitarist YouTube channel. Recent artists who have been featured in Guitarist include: Joe Perry, Jimmy Page, Marc Ford, Joe Bonamassa, Charlie Hunter, Jackson Browne, Guthrie Govan, Jim Campilongo, Eric Johnson and Steve Vai. In addition to artist interviews, Guitarist regularly features in-depth features relating to a specific guitarist, guitar or musical genre. Recent examples of these in-depth features include cover features a forensic examination and history of Brian May's guitar The Red Special, a similar treatment of David Gilmour's famous Black Stratocaster, historical features on blues legends, slide guitar, the Fender Stratocaster, the Gibson Les Paul and various others.  Playing and technique  Guitarist has previously included a large technique section at the rear of the magazine with columns reflecting a wide array of different guitar styles, however, this has in recent years been reduced to a single regular column, the long-running Blues Headlines with current Guitar Techniques editor and former \\"Guitarist\\" editor Neville Marten. While the magazine features less monthly technique columns, instead Guitarist now regularly peppers its features section with 'style files'. These style files are often amended to an artist interview or history feature, and are designed to allow the reader to learn the playing style of the artist or genre featured therein. An example of this is the regular 'Aces' feature, which each month covers a different legendary guitar player from the early days of the electric guitar. The feature comprises a history of the artist's life and contribution to guitar music, which is then followed by a style file encapsulating his key innovations and stylistic techniques. All tuition content in the magazine is accompanied by tablature of each lesson or example, as well as video and audio content, including backing tracks, to make learning easier.  Video and audio content  Every month Guitarist produces pro-level video demos of all of the products reviewed in the magazine that month, as well as video interviews and features with top guitar artists, and audio examples for the Blues Headlines tuition column, and video and audio examples to accompany any other tuition featured in the magazine that month (these regularly include 'play in the style of' columns, as well as video masterclasses with famous guitar players such as Joe Bonamassa). These videos are available to watch online via a private YouTube playlist link featured in the magazine each month, or if you purchase the iPad version of the magazine, all video and audio content is embedded to watch offline.  Digital versions  Since late-2011, Guitarist has been available to purchase in digital forms - initially just on Apple iPad, but later on Android devices, iPhones and the Kindle Fire. Initially, a bespoke Guitarist Deluxe edition of the magazine was produced for the iPad. Launching to coincide with the introduction of Apple Newsstand, it was a fully enhanced digital edition of the magazine, with fully interactive audio and video content, pages specifically designed to be read on the iPad, and various other multimedia features. This was discontinued in late 2012, and the magazine moved to its current page-turner format. On Android, Kindle and Zinio devices, the digital edition of Guitarist is a simple digital facsimile of the print product, however, the iOS Newsstand version is enhanced with embedded video and audio content, as well as image galleries.  Other products  In addition to the regular magazine, Guitarist produces a number of one-off and semi-regular editions. These have included 100 Great Guitar Players, 100 Great Guitars, The Guitarist Guide To Effects and The Guitarist Guide To Home Recording. In late 2013, Guitarist launched a quarterly sister- title, named Guitarist Presents Acoustic. As the name suggest, this title provides the same mix of gear reviews, interviews and playing tuition as the primary title, but is focussed purely on acoustic guitars and guitar players.

Team name A 1991 student campaign resulted in McGill dropping Indigenous imagery as part of their athletics program, although the name \\"Redmen\\" was not changed until 2019. According to Suzanne Morton, a professor of history at McGill, the name \\"McGill Redmen\\" was first adopted in 1927, initially intended to reflect James McGill's Scottish heritage and hair color. After the hiring of a new football coach from the United States sometime before 1940, Indigenous imagery was brought in to accompany the name as a show of spectacle. Men's teams became colloquially known as the \\"Indians\\" and from 1961 to 1967 women's teams were formally known as the \\"Super Squaws\\". 1950s McGill team logos featured Aboriginal Canadian iconography and reports by news sources in the 1950s refer to the \\"McGill Indians\\" in their sports reporting. Stereotyped Indigenous iconography was on McGill football and hockey team jerseys and helmets until 1992 when a student-led campaign against the name and imagery led to their removal. At the same time, a large crest depicting an Indigenous man wearing a headdress was removed from the McGill gym. A second student-led campaign, #ChangeTheName, was organized in 2017 by the McGill Student Union Indigenous Affairs committee. In a 2018 referendum organized by McGill's student union, 78.8% of 5,856 participating students voted in favour of changing the teams' name. On April 12, 2019, McGill announced that \\"McGill University's men's varsity teams will cease to be called the Redmen.\\" McGill indicated that the men's varsity teams will be known as the McGill teams for the 2019‚Äì2020 athletic season, and that a new name will be announced for the 2020‚Äì2021 season. Mascot Since 2005, the mascot for both the men's and women's varsity teams has been Marty the Martlet. The mascot made its first appearance at the 2005 Homecoming men's football game, where it was presented to the McGill Athletics Department by the Student Organization for Alumni Relations.. Football Football at McGill, 1946. The McGill U Sports football team is one of the oldest in all of Canada, having begun organized competition in 1874. The team has appeared in three Vanier Cup national championships, in 1969, 1973 and 1987, with the team finally winning the title in the 1987 game. McGill plays out of Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, where the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes also play. After their 2005 suspension, the team struggled with three losing seasons, including two winless seasons in 2007 and 2008. The program showed signs of hope as the team won three games in 2009, but soon sank back down to futility with consecutive winless campaigns in 2010 and 2011. Ice hockey McGill goalie during 2014 Queen's Cup. Ice hockey at McGill, 1901. On March 3, 1875 the first organized indoor game was played at Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink by James George Aylwin Creighton and several McGill University students. In 1877, several McGill students, including Creighton, Henry Joseph, Richard F. Smith, W.F. Robertson, and W.L. Murray codified seven ice hockey rules. The McGill University Hockey Club ‚Äì later re-christened \\"The Redmen\\" ‚Äì was founded in 1877, arguably making the McGill men's hockey team the first and oldest ice hockey club in the world. The university operates both men's and women's teams in U Sports. The teams play at McGill's McConnell Arena. The men's team has won championships in 1883, 1903, 1905, 1912, 1918, 1921, 1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1946, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, including the 2012 CIS University Cup national championship. The women's team has won championships in 1985, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. On November 15, 2003, Kim St. Pierre was the first woman in U Sports history to be credited with a win in a men's regular season game. This occurred when McGill defeated the Ryerson Rams by a score of 5‚Äì2. Other sports =Lacrosse= Lacrosse was played to a limited extent at McGill as early as 1873. The 15-man McGill Lacrosse Club of 1898 was led by F. L. Thompson (President), R. H. Craig (Vice President), and A. J. Grant (Secretary Treasurer). Numerous American clubs, including Brooklyn, Staten Island, Yale, and Harvard, challenged that McGill Lacrosse Club, but it was impossible to accept on account of approaching exams.McGill Year Book, 1898. McGill's lacrosse tradition was not re-established until 2001, when a McGill freshman organized a student lacrosse club. In 2002 the team gained Level-3 varsity club status at McGill, and joined the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association, Canada's premier league founded in 1985. In 2007 the team's status was elevated to a Level-2 varsity team by McGill Athletics. McGill has twice won Canada's national championship, the Baggataway Cup, in 2012 and 2015. McGill competes in the CUFLA East versus Bishop's, Carleton, Nipissing, Ottawa, Trent and Queen's Universities. Four-time recipient of the Harry Griffith's Award in 2007, 2008, 2012 and 2015, the team has won eight CUFLA East conference titles in 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The team has achieved a record of 97‚Äì11‚Äì1 since 2011 versus Canadian opponents. The hybrid Canadian-box-American-field lacrosse program is geographically diverse with student-athletes recruited from across Canada and the US. The team plays home games in McGill's Percival Molson Memorial Stadium. =Soccer= The soccer program at McGill operates for a big part of the school year. On top of the regular U Sports fall season there is a Quebec indoor season, which runs from January to mid March. Preparation for the U Sports season starts with try-outs in mid-August and several preseason games against NCAA teams. =Sailing= McGill's sailing program was founded in 1949, and the first regattas took place in Northern New England. Today, the team competes in the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association, which itself is a part of the Intercollegiate Sailing Association and in the Canadian Intercollegiate Sailing Association. The team trains out of the Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club throughout the fall and competes in dinghies such as the collegiate 420 and the Flying Junior. =Baseball= The baseball team plays in the Canadian Collegiate Baseball Association (CCBA). They have won seven national championships (2006 and 2010 under the old CIBA banner and 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 under the new CCBA banner), and have appeared in two national finals (2005 and 2008). In the 2016 CCBA National Tournament, held at Ahuntsic Park in Montreal, the Redmen went 2‚Äì1 in pool play, advancing to the semi-finals where they defeated the Saint Mary's Huskies by a score of 21‚Äì0, and then defeated the Montreal Carabins in the national championship game 3‚Äì2 on a walk-off home run by catcher Christopher Stanford. This victory marked a three-peat for the Redmen as Canadian National Champions, a streak which has now been extended to five straight national championships. The team plays out of Trudeau Park in C√¥te-Saint-Luc. Public image =2005 hazing scandal= A 2005 hazing scandal forced the cancellation of the final two games in the McGill Redmen football season.

The idea for the ballet was proposed by Bliss, and subsequently produced by de Valois for the Vic-Wells Ballet. It was first performed on 15 June 1937 at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris. Checkmate is widely regarded as de Valois' signature ballet and a cornerstone of the British ballet repertoire, being performed regularly by the Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet.http://www.vaimusic.com/VIDEO/DVD_4379_Checkmate_RakesProgress.htm Overview After World War I, Bliss developed an interest in ballet, after seeing the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev in London. Bliss composed Checkmate for the Vic-Wells Ballet (later the Sadler's Wells Ballet), who produced the first performance at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in 1937. Constant Lambert conducted the Orchestre Lamoureux, and the premiere dancers included the following: * June Brae (Black Queen) * Harold Turner (Red Knight) * Michael Somes (Black Knight) * Frederick Ashton (Death) * Robert Helpmann (Red King) * Pamela May (Red Queen) * Margot Fonteyn (leader of the Black Pawns) * Annabel Farjeon (a pawn) The UK premiere of Checkmate was on 5 October 1937 at Sadler's Wells. The music received its first radio broadcast performance on 15 October 1937, over the BBC. Sections * Prologue‚ÄîThe Players: Moderato maestoso * Dances of the Red Pawns: Allegro spirito scherzando * Dance of the Four Knights: Allegro moderato sempre robustamente * Entry of the Black Queen: L'istesso tempo * The Red Knight's Mazurka: Moderato giojosamente * Ceremony of the Red Bishops: Largamente (misticamente) * Entry of the Red Castles: Allegro molto deciso * Entry of the Red King and Queen: Grave * The Attack: Allegro impetuoso e brillante * The Duel: Maestoso moderato e molto appassionato * The Black Queen Dances: Allegretto dispettoso * Finale‚ÄîCheckmate: Andante poco sostenuto‚Äîallegro vivace e feroce Synopsis The premise of the ballet is that the chess pieces become animated and act out human emotions. The main conflict of the story concerns the Red Knight's love for the Black Queen. In the Prologue, two chess players are shown, ready to do battle. The player in gold represents Love and chooses the red side. The player in black represents Death and takes the black side. The ballet proper begins with the Red Pawns assembling on the chessboard. The Red Knights arrive on the scene, afterwards joined by the Black Knights. The Black Knights prostrate themselves at the entry of the Black Queen, who fills them with fear. The Black Queen makes advances to the Red Knight and tosses him a rose, and the Red Knight becomes infatuated with the Black Queen. The Red King and Red Queen arrive, with the old Red King requiring assistance. An initial \\"game\\" between the two sides finishes as the Black Queen has the Red King in a \\"check\\" position. This game leads to a duel between the Red Knight and the Black Queen, where the Red Knight is victorious over the Black Queen. However, he cannot bring himself to kill her because of his love for her. In one moment, he turns his back and recalls the rose from the Black Queen. The Black Queen takes advantage and fatally stabs the Red Knight. The funeral cort√®ge for the Red Knight is described as \\"Death leading, Love at the end of the procession\\". The Black Queen then turns on the Red King, and the Black forces surround him. The Red King has one last moment of recalling his youth before the Black Queen stabs him in the back with a spear, in the final \\"checkmate\\".

The song was written by bassist Jack Bruce and was the only song on Gears that Jack wrote without lyricist Pete Brown. Song structure With the song's lyrics being only two stanzas long, Jack Bruce's vocals are stretched out throughout the length of the song and are backed by Eric Clapton's psychedelic-style guitar work and Ginger Baker's drum beat which, at least when played live, uses Timpani drum mallets instead of regular drumsticks. The 6/8 time signature also gives the song a distinct and irregular sound. Bruce's vocals are falsetto and crooning-like and are accompanied with a slow bass line and a bluesy/psychedelic guitar melody; however Baker‚Äôs drumming is often frenetic and fast paced, making it completely at odds with the rest of the instruments. Live history Many of the tracks on Disraeli Gears, including \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", were dropped from Cream's live set in late-1967 and replaced by longer tracks such as the rendition of \\"Spoonful\\" and Ginger Baker's instrumental \\"Toad\\". \\"We're Going Wrong\\", however, achieved occasional play time.

Charles Messier also spotted the comet on 8 January 1760 in Paris, by the sword of Orion. The comet was his third discovery and the comet was the 51st to have a calculated orbit. Messier observed the comet for a total of 6 days. It approached the Earth to within approximately 0.0682 astronomical unit (AU) or 6.34 million miles. This is the 17th closest approach by a comet of all time. Messier gave the comet a magnitude rating of 2.0, making it easily visible to the unaided eye. Messier also gave the comet an elongation angle of 140 degrees. Messier came up against opposition from Navy astronomer Joseph Nicholas Delisle, who had employed Messier from October 1751, because Delisle would not publish the discovery Messier had made. This was a continuation of the mistrust that had developed between Messier and Delisle because Delisle had been slow to publish work done by Messier in 1759; Messier had independently rediscovered Halley's Comet on 21 January 1759 but because Messier had doubted the correctness of Delisle's path, Delisle instructed Messier to continue observing the comet and refused to announce his discovery. Delisle apparently later changed his mind and announced the discovery on 1 April 1759, but other French astronomers discredited Delisle's claim, labelling the discovery an April Fools' joke.

It was made at Riverside Studios by Hammer Film Productions. Plot Dr. Philip Ritter, a plastic surgeon (Paul Henreid), falls in love with a gifted and beautiful concert pianist, Alice Brent (Lizabeth Scott). They meet by chance at a country inn, and romance soon develops. However, Alice is already engaged to be married and, afraid to tell Ritter, runs away. Ritter is devastated. Back at his London surgery, Ritter receives a phone call from Alice, who informs him she is to marry David (Andr√© Morell). Meanwhile, Ritter's new patient is Lily Conover (Mary Mackenzie), a female convict whose face is disfigured. The love-struck surgeon believes he can change her criminal ways by constructing her new face to resemble that of Alice. He does so, and they marry. (Now identical to Alice, she is played by Scott.) However, Lily has not changed her ways. She soon grows bored of Ritter's sedate lifestyle, and returns to a life of crime and partying. She is reckless in her behaviour, and unabashedly flirtatious with other men, and he comes to despise her. As Alice completes her latest concert tour, David knows there is something wrong with her. He guesses she is in love with someone else, and calls off the engagement. Alice goes to see Ritter, who confesses what he has done. Later, an upset Ritter leaves London for Plymouth, believing that the situation can never be reversed. Lily follows him, however, and takes the same train, where she becomes drunk and aggressive towards Ritter. Alice believes Ritter is so upset he may harm Lily, or even kill her if provoked, and she too joins the train. She arrives just as the two are arguing, and engaged in a physical struggle as Ritter tries to prevent the intoxicated Lily from falling out of the carriage. As Alice enters, Lily accidentally falls against the loose carriage door, and falls out of the train. The film ends as Lily is discovered dead at the side of the tracks, and Ritter and Alice are reunited.

It should be distinguished from the merlette of French heraldry, which is a duck-like bird with a swan- neck and chopped-off beak and legs. Etymology The word \\"martlet\\" is derived from the bird known as the martin, with the addition of the diminutive suffix \\"-let\\"; thus martlet means \\"little martin\\". The origin of the name martin is obscure, though it may refer to the festival Martinmas, which occurs around the same time martins begin their migration from Europe to Africa. Description These mythical birds are shown properly in English heraldry with two or three short tufts of feathers in place of legs and feet. Swifts, formerly known as martlets, have such small legs that they were believed to have none at all. The Sooty Tern really does spend years in continuous flight; it cannot float and so must sleep on the wing or never sleep at all, which lends credence to the legend of the legless Martlet. =French Merlette= Basic form of the French merlette, not to be confused with the English \\"martlet\\" Duke of Ursel, Belgium In French heraldry the canette or anet is a small duck (French: canard), shown without feet. According to Th√©odore Veyrin- ForrerPr√©cis d'h√©raldique, Paris, 1951, Arts Styles et Techniques, p.114 la canette repr√©sente la canne ou le canard; si elle est d√©pourvue du bec et des pattes, elle devient une merlette. (\\"The canette represents the duck or drake; if she is deprived of beak and feet she becomes a merlette\\"). In French un merle, from Latin merula (feminine),Cassell's Latin Dictionary is a male blackbird, a member of the thrush family (formerly the term was feminine and could designate a male: une merle‚Äîa hen blackbird: une merlesse). A merlette (diminutive form of merle: a little blackbird) in common parlance, since the 19th century, is a female blackbird, but in heraldic terminology is defined as une figure repr√©sentant une canette morn√©e (\\"a figure representing a little female duck 'blunted'\\"). Une cane is a female duck (male canard, \\"drake\\") and une canette, the diminutive form, is \\"a little female duck\\". The verb morner in ancient French means \\"to blunt\\", in heraldic terminology the verbal adjective morn√©(e) means: sans langue, sans dents, sans ongles et des oiseaux sans bec ni serres (\\"without tongue, without teeth, without nails and birds without beak or claws\\").Dictionnaire Larousse Lexis English heraldry uses the terms \\"armed\\" and \\"langued\\" for the teeth, claws and tongue of heraldic beasts, thus morn√©e might be translated as \\"dis-armed\\". Thus the English \\"martlet\\" is not the same heraldic creature as the French \\"merlette\\".www.briantimms.fr Early usage =de Valence= heraldic shield of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke (d.1296), drawn from his tomb in Westminster Abbey. Champlevee enamel with diapering The arms of the Valence family, Earls of Pembroke show one of the earliest uses of the martlet to difference them from their parent house of Lusignan. Their arms were orled (bordered) with martlets, as can be seen on the enamelled shield of the effigy of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke (d.1296) in Westminster Abbey. Martlets are thus shown in the arms of Pembroke College, Cambridge, a foundation of that family. =Attributed arms of Edward the Confessor= Richard II (1377-1399), showing the attributed arms of Edward the Confessor impaling the arms of Plantagenet The official crest and arms of McGill University contain three red martlets. Marty the Martlet is the university's iconic mascot The attributed arms of Edward the Confessor contain five martlets or (golden martlets). The attribution dates to the 13th century (two centuries after Edward's death) and was based on the design on a coin minted during Edward's reign.Frank Barlow, Edward the Confessor (1984) p. 184, citing R. H. M. Dolley and F. Elmore Jones, 'A new suggestion concerning the so- called \\"Martlets\\" in the \\"Arms of St Edward\\"' in Dolley (ed.), Anglo-Saxon Coins (1961), 215-226. King Richard II (1377‚Äì1399) impaled this coat with the Plantagenet arms, and it later became the basis of the arms of Westminster Abbey, in which The Confessor was buried, and of Westminster School, founded within its precinct. =de Arundel of Lanherne= The French word for swallow is hirondelle, from Latin hirundo, and therefore martlets have appeared in the canting arms of the ancient family of de Arundel of Lanherne, Cornwall and later of Wardour Castle. The arms borne by Reinfred de Arundel (d.c.1280), lord of the manor of Lanherne, were recorded in the 15th-century Shirley Roll of Arms as: Sable, six martlets argent., quoted Foster, Joseph, Some Feudal Coats of Arms 1298-1418, (1901) This family should not be confused with that of FitzAlan Earls of Arundel, whose seat was Arundel Castle in Sussex, who bear for arms: Gules, a lion rampant or. =County of Sussex= The shield of the county of Sussex, England contains six martlets said to represent the six historical rapes, or former administrative sub-divisions, of the county. It seems likely this bore a canting connection to the title of the Earls of Arundel (the French word for swallow is hirondelle), who were the leading county family for many centuries, or the name of their castle. The university of Sussex's coat of arms also bear these six martlets. =de Verdon/Dundalk= Arms of Dundalk (1319-) showing six martlets A bend between six martlets forms the coat of arms of Dundalk, Ireland. The bend and martlets are derived from the family of Thomas de Furnivall who obtained a large part of the land and property of Dundalk and district in about 1319 by marriage to Joan de Verdon daughter of Theobald de Verdon.Ireland - DUNDALK Three of these martlets, in reversed tinctures, form the arms of the local association football team Dundalk FC. Mark of cadency It has been suggested that the restlessness of the martlet due to its supposed inability to land, having no usable feet, is the reason for the use of the martlet in English heraldry as the cadency mark of a fourth son. The first son inherited all the estate by primogeniture, the second and third traditionally went into the Church, to serve initially as priests in churches of which their father held the advowson, and the fourth had no well-defined place (unless his father possessed, as was often the case, more than two vacant advowsons). As the fourth son often therefore received no part of the family wealth and had \\"the younger son's portion: the privilege of leaving home to make a home for himself\\",Cock, J., Records of ye Antient Borough of South Molton in ye County of Devon, 1893, Chapter VII: Mr Hugh Squier and his Family, p.174 the martlet may also be a symbol of hard work, perseverance, and a nomadic household. This explanation seems implausible, as the 5th and 6th sons were equally \\"restless\\", yet no apparent reference is made to this in their proper cadence mark (an annulet and fleur-de-lys respectively). Modern significance The formerly supposed inability of the martlet to land is said by some modern commentators to symbolize the constant quest for knowledge, learning, and adventure. The martlet is in the arms of Worcester College, Oxford University College, Oxford, Magdalene College, Cambridge and of Pembroke College, Cambridge. The martlet has also been incorporated into the modern arms of McGill University, in which the women's athletic teams are named the McGill Martlets; the University of Houston and the University of Houston Law Center; Worcester College, Oxford; and Westminster School, the University of Victoria (where the student newspaper is also called The Martlet). The martlet is also used in the coat of arms of the Bromsgrove School, Charles Wright Academy, Warwick School, Penistone Grammar School, Mill Hill School and Saltus Grammar School in Bermuda www.saltus.bm. The significance of the martlet in the arms of various ancient English colleges and schools is derived quite simply from elements within the arms of their founders. In popular culture A talking martlet is employed as a story-device in ER Edisson's fantasy novel The Worm Ouroboros. At the outset of the novel the martlet conducts the reader to Mercury whereon the action proceeds. Thereafter it performs a linking role as a messenger of the Gods. It also appears in Shakespeare's Macbeth Act 1 Sc 6, when King Duncan and Banquo call it a 'guest of summer' and see it mistakenly as a good omen when they spot it outside Macbeth's castle, shortly before Duncan is killed. Louise Penny makes reference to the martlet in A Rule Against Murder, the fourth book in her Inspector Gamache series (see chapter 27). Gamache discusses the four adult Morrow children with their stepfather, Bert Finney, while overlooking Lake Massawippi at the fictional Manoir Bellechasse, the site of the murder. Gamache explains that the martlet signifies the fourth child, who must make his/her own way in the world.

Hagop Kevorkian (; born in 1872 in Kayseri, Ottoman Empire ‚Äì died in 1962 in New York, US) was an Armenian-American archeologist, connoisseur of art, and collector, originally from Kayseri, who graduated from the American Robert College in Istanbul, settled in New York City in the late 19th century, and helped America acquire a taste for Eastern artifacts. He carried out excavations in Iran, at Sultanabad from 1903 and at the medieval city of Rey from c. 1907, and assembled an outstanding collection of Oriental art, especially Islamic and Persian. He organized the exhibition of Islamic ceramics in London in 1911. The works excavated under his supervision were shown in New York in 1914. Major sales of Islamic pieces from his collection, including lacquer doors and tile panels from Isfahan, books and paintings, carpets and ceramics, were held in the 1920s at the Anderson Gallery, New York. In 1929 he acquired at auction the Mughal album of calligraphy and painting that became known as the Kevorkian Album, now renamed \\"The Shah Jahan Album\\" by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (rather confusingly, as there is at least one other album called this). The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. now hold elements of the Kevorkian Album in their collections. An auction of some of his collection occurred in 1970 at the Parke-Bernet Galleries. The Brooklyn Art Museum's Kevorkian Gallery displays the Assyrian reliefs he donated to the institution. In New York, after Kevorkian's death, his foundation established the Kevorkian Chair of Iranian Studies at Columbia University. New York University has a center named after him that houses its Middle Eastern studies department and library.The Hagop Kevorkian Center The Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at New York University was created in 1966 to foster the interdisciplinary study of the modern and contemporary Middle East and to enhance public understanding of the region.The Hagop Kevorkian Center, National Resource Centers He was a major benefactor of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Ninety-nine objects in the Penn Museum collections came from Kevorkian, either through purchase or, later, donation.

In the legal literature, slaves who enter this contract are known as mukatab.Brunschvig, Encyclopedia of Islam, Abd The ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ school of Islamic jurisprudence view it to be compulsory,Bidayat al-Mujtahid wa Nihayat al- Muqtasid, Ibn Rushd, volume 2, page 453 Excerpt from 'Discover the Truth'Talfheem ul Quran while the Shafa'is, Malikis and Hanafis perceive it to be merely recommended, and mustahabb (praiseworthy) to do so.Gordon 41 Mukataba is one of the four procedures provided in Islam for manumission of slaves.Ahmad A. Sikainga(1995), p.7  Scriptural References  =Qur'an= The institution of mukataba is based on Qur'an : A slave identified as Subay referred to his master, Sayyidina Huwaytib bin Abdul Izza, for Kitaba, or a letter of manumission, and was promptly refused. The verse in question was thus revealed, and Huwaytib agreed to grant him emancipation if the slave offered him hundred dinars, twenty of which the former later remitted.Asbab Al NuzulTanwir al-Miqbas min Tafsir Ibn Abbas =Hadith= Muhammad al-Bukhari, a major hadith collector, has two books concerning the manumission of a slave; Kitab al-'itq (the book on emancipation), and Kitab al-Mukataba (the book on contracts of manumission) with the latter narrating a single hadith six times with variance in the matn.Chouki El Hamid, Black Morocco: A history of slavery, race and Islam, pg 40 The hadith concerns Barira - a slave girl inherited by the sons of Utba bin Abu Lahab - consulting Ayesha in need for payment of the kitaba. Ayesha argued that she could instead buy Barira and set her free herself in return for the latter's wala, but the men refused, stating the wala be for themselves. Muhammad confirmed Ayesha's beliefs.Bukhari, Kitab al Mukataab Bukhari makes mention of a slave known as Sirin, who owned some wealth, requesting emancipation from Musa bin Anas; who supposedly refused granting the contract. Umar, after being consulted by the slave, ordered that Musa was to be lashed, verbalizing the expression, \\"Give them such a contract if ye find any good in them.\\"Muhammad Shibli Nomani, Umar, the makers of Civillization, pg 26Choki Al Hamef, Black Morocco: A history of slavery, race and Islam, pg 41 Ibn Kathir believes Bukhari's narration is disconnected, but Abdur Razzaq's one to be Saheeh. The following changes were added in the latter one: \\"Ibn Jarir recorded that Sirin wanted Anas bin Malik to write a contract of emancipation and he delayed, then \`Umar said to him, 'You should certainly write him a contract of emancipation.'\\" Islamic Law =Early Islam= According to Joseph Schacht, those who were hearing Muhammad pronouncing this verse \\"were supposed to know the details of the transaction referred to, and the strictest interpretation of the passage suggests that it was not identical with the contract of manumission by mukataba such as was elaborated later by the ancient lawyers in the second century of Islam.\\" The earliest interpretation of the verse suggested that the mukatab became free after paying one-half of the agreed amount. Another early decision attributed to the Meccan scholar Ata ibn Rabi Rabah was that the slave acquired liberty having paid three-quarters. The doctrine of an early school of Islamic jurisprudence based in Kufa held that the mukatab became free as soon as he paid off his value; other contemporaneous opinions were that the mukatab became free pro rata with the payments or that he became free immediately after concluding the contract, the payments to his master being ordinary debts. Finally the view of the Kufan scholars prevailed, and according to Schacht, the hadith supporting this position were put into circulation; first they were projected to Muhammad's companions and later to Muhammad himself.Schacht 42-43 =Obligation upon master to grant the contract= There is debate amongst scholars regarding the obligation upon the master to grant this contract. The ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ school of Islamic jurisprudence view it to be compulsory, while the Shafa'is, Malikis and Hanafis perceive it to be merely recommended, and praise-worthy to do so. Abul A'la Maududi says: A group of jurists have interpreted this as ‚Äúexecute the deed of emancipation with them‚Äù, that it is obligatory for the owner to accept the offer of a slave to earn his emancipation. This is the view of Ata, Amr bin Dinar Ibn Sirin, Masruq, Dahhak, Ikrimah, the Zahiriyyah and Ibn Jarir Tabari, and Imam Shafai also favoured it in the beginning. The other group holds that it is not obligatory but only recommendatory and commendable. This group includes jurists like Shabi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Hasan Basri, Abdul Rahman bin Zaid, Sufyan Thauri, Abu Hanifah and Malik bin Anas and Imam Shafai later on also had adopted this view. Maududi highlights the affirmation regarding the obligation by citing the Ahadith recounted by Abdur Razzaq and Bukhari in reference to a slave mentioned as Sirin, who owned some wealth, requesting emancipation from Musa bin Anas; who supposedly refused granting the contract. Umar, after being consulted by the slave, ordered that Musa was to be lashed, verbalizing the expression, \\"Give them such a contract if ye find any good in them.\\"Tafseer Ibn Kathir, 'The Command to Grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation' Maududi states that the argument against this proposes that only one incident was not sufficient enough to be declared as evidence for such a claim. He retorts that, \\"All that can be said is that Umar, apart from his position of a judge, was like a father to the Muslims and might have used his paternal authority in a matter where he could not intervene as a judge. Maududi claims that the phrase, \\"if ye know any good in them:\\" renders this as upon the master to decide due to its subjectivity, and a lack of fix standard as to what qualifies as \\"good.\\" Ashiq Ilahi cites Umar bin Dinar and Sayiddana Ali as being proponents for the first part of the verse,\\"give them such a deed,\\" as using imperative tone, hence making it compulsory. He states that Dur al- Manthur credited the hadith mentioned in Abu Dawud and Bayhaqi, which included Muhammad defining \\"good\\" as reference to one's skill and qualifications for labour and also hinting there being an implication of it simply forbidding the slave be compelled to beg. He claims that the hadith also mentions that Allah will aid the slave in paying his debt, henceforth the former must focus on earning halal income.Illuminating Discourses on the Noble Quran ‚Äì Tafseer Anwarul Bayan ‚Äì by Shaykh Ashiq Ilahi Madni, volume 3, page 590 ‚Äì 592 Excerpt from 'Discover the Truth' Ibn Kathir summarizes this up like this: This is a command from Allah to slave-owners: if their servants ask them for a contract of emancipation, they should write for them, provided that the servant has some skill and means of earning so that he can pay his master the money that is stipulated in the contract. =The Mukatib= There are two different views of mukataba among scholars causing a divergence in the details: some call mukataba as a \\"conditional enfranchisement\\", while others see it as \\"ransom by the slave of his own person\\". Jurists usually disapprove of entering a mukataba with a female slave with no honest source of income. The majority of Sunni authorities approved the manumission of all the \\"People of the Book\\", that is, Christians and Jews, but according to some jurists, especially among the Shi‚Äôa, only Muslim slaves should be liberated.Lewis(1990) 106 According to the opinion of a majority of Muslim jurists, the slave must pay the agreed- upon amount in instalments. The followers of Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence accept one immediate payment; scholars of the Maliki school require one instalment, while Hanbalis and Shafi'is insist on at least two instalments. The slaves were allowed to either work independently and apply their earnings for their ransom, or to work for the master.Dursteler 76 Having given his consent the owner was not permitted to change his mind, although the slave had such an option. In the event the slave became delinquent in meeting the payments, he was obliged to return to unqualified servitude, with the master keeping the money already paid him. At the end of the payments, a rebate is usually given to the slave in compliance with . The amount of the rebate depending on the authorities can be \\"fixed or discretionary, obligatory or merely recommended\\". The emancipation of a mukatab occurs only when he has paid to the master the agreed amount in full. The contract may be revoked when the slave defaults on one of the payments. The mukatab may receive the proceeds from the Islamic charity (zakat), but he is not entitled to them.Schacht 130 When the mukatab makes the final payment, he is entitled to a rebate, in compliance with the Qur'anic text. Islamic authorities disagree as to whether the rebate is obligatory or merely recommended and whether its sum is fixed or discretionary. After manumission, the slave liberated through mukataba remains a client (mawali) of his former master. Most Muslim scholars forbid selling the slave after concluding the mukataba; the Hanbalis, who disagree with this view, maintain that the purchaser inherits the obligation to liberate the mukatab under the terms of the contract of enfranchisement. The owner cannot marry a mukatab without his or her consent.Schacht 131 Islamic law prohibits concubinage with a female slave who has concluded a mukataba.

He is currently the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations and will be the next Israeli ambassador to the United States. He previously served as a member of the Knesset for Likud from 2003 to 2020, as well as holding several ministerial positions, including Minister of Environmental Protection (2009‚Äì2013), Communications (2013‚Äì2014), Home Front Defense (2013‚Äì2014), Interior (2014‚Äì2015), Minister of Public Security (2015‚Äì2020), Minister of Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy (2015‚Äì2020) and Minister of Regional Cooperation (2020). Background and personal life Gilad Menashe Erdan was born in Ashkelon. He is of Romanian Jewish and Hungarian Jewish descent. He attained the rank of Captain during his military service in the Adjutant Corps of the IDF. After his military service, he studied Law at Bar-Ilan University, gaining an LL.B, and started working as an attorney. Later on, he gained a Master's Degree in Political Science from Tel- Aviv University (cum laude). Erdan lives in Kiryat Ono and is married with four children. Political career Erdan began his political activity in opposition to the Oslo Accords, during his legal studies in the early 1990s. In these circumstances he met with then Likud MK Ariel Sharon, and soon started working as Sharon's political advisor. When Likud won the elections in 1996, Erdan was appointed as an advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and as director of the Department for Public Inquiries to the Prime Minister's Office between 1996 and 1998. In February 1998, Erdan was elected by a vast majority as the chairman of \\"Young Likud\\", and served in this position for 6 years. During his term as Young Likud chairman, Erdan led many of the party's ideological and field activities in opposition to Ehud Barak's government. = Member of Knesset = Erdan was first elected to the 16th Knesset in the 2003 elections. During his first term in the Knesset, Erdan was one of the most outspoken opponents of the unilateral Disengagement Plan from the Gaza Strip lead by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon from the Likud. In November 2005, Faced with harsh opposition to his plan, Sharon left Likud with several other MKs, and created a new party, Kadima. Erdan remained in Likud and after winning fourth place in the party's primaries, retained his seat in the 17th Knesset in the 2006 elections despite Likud's collapse from 40 to 12 seats in the Knesset. Erdan was re-elected to the 18th Knesset in 2009. Serving as Member of Knesset, Erdan has supported boosting ties between Israel and Evangelical Christians, as well as presenting bills to enforce no-smoking laws,Knesset panel to discuss 'red cards' for smokers The Jerusalem Post, 26 February 2007 permanently revoking the driving licenses of serial traffic offenders,MK proposes permanently revoking licenses of serial traffic offenders Haaretz, 9 October 2006 and allowing the courts to revoke citizenship for citizens visiting enemy countries or acquiring citizenship from such countries.'Disloyalty' bill passes first hurdle The Jerusalem Post, 10 January 2007 The latter bill was submitted following Israeli Arab MK Azmi Bishara's visit to Syria, an enemy-state to the state of Israel. = In the 32nd Government = After the 2009 elections to the Knesset, Erdan was appointed Minister of Environmental Protection, and the Minister in charge of coordinating between the Government and the Knesset in the 32nd Government.Netanyahu sworn in as Israel's prime minister Haaretz, 1 April 2009. Upon the government taking office, he expressed support for Avigdor Lieberman's speech opposing the Annapolis Conference and international pressure. He commented that \\"Israel does not take orders from Obama\\" and that \\"citizens of Israel have decided that they will not become the fifty first US state\\".'Israel does not take orders from Obama'. The Hindu. Published 7 April 2009.'Erdan: We're Not the 51st State'. Israel National News. Published 6 April 2009. As Minister of Environmental Protection, Erdan introduced the most comprehensive River Restoration program to date, legislated and enforced the protection of beaches and the coastline, increased recycling through a bottling and packaging law, and created the Beer Sheva River Park ‚Äì an ecological park built on a former garbage dump ‚Äì where thousands of people enjoy bike paths, walking trails, a lake, sports area, and a botanical garden. He initiated a \\"pollution has no borders\\" policy which included reducing Israel's Greenhouse Gas Emissions, increasing water desalination, in an effort to make Israel the world leader in water recycling. He also imposed limitations on the import and export of living monkeys for medical purposes, resulting in the closure of the \\"Mazor Farm\\", a disputed monkey-breeding farm. In May 2009, Erdan was declared \\"man of the decade\\" by Or Yarok, a prominent road safety NGO in Israel, for his lasting efforts to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities. = In the 33rd Government = Following the 2013 elections to the Knesset, Erdan was appointed the Minister of Communications and Minister of Home Front Defense in the 33rd Government. He was also appointed as a member of the Security Cabinet. On 22 April 2014, after several ongoing disputes with the Defense Minister, Moshe (Bogi) Yaalon, on matters of authority, Erdan announced his resignation as the Minister of Home Front Defense, and called the Prime-Minister to dissolve the Ministry entirely. The ministry was shut down subsequently. In November 2014 Erdan was appointed Minister of Interior following Gideon Sa'ar's resignation. = In the 34th Government = Erdan surveying the readiness of emergency services for stormy weather, with Prime-Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Police Commissioner Moti Cohen and Fire & Rescue Commissioner Dedi Simhi. On 24 May 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed Erdan as Minister of Public Security, Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy in the 34th Government. Erdan was again appointed as a member of the Security Cabinet. Erdan's appointment came eleven days after he initially refused to join Netanyahu's cabinet, claiming he wasn't offered enough tools to make a real change as a Minister.Pride Parade in Jerusalem, with Police Commissioner Moti Cohen and commander of the Jerusalem district, Doron Yadid. As the Minister of Public Security, Erdan was in charge of the National Police, Prison Service and the Fire & Rescue Services. As Minister of Strategic Affaits and Public Diplomacy, Erdan received the responsibility to coordinate the national response to the attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel, and spearhead the fight against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel. Upon entering his role, the state of Israel started facing a new wave of Palestinian terror attacks, carried out mainly by incited individuals, and commonly referred to as the \\"Knife Intifada\\". Erdan's plan to deal with this new wave of terror, consisted of several steps: strengthening police presence in Jerusalem, which became a symbol for terrorists; outlawing Muslim organizations who incited against Jews and harassed them on the Temple Mount; and dealing with online incitement. In addition, Erdan initiated the construction and opening of new police stations in East Jerusalem, signaling to the residents of its neighborhoods that the state of Israel will not give up its sovereignty in these areas. In his attempts to deal with online incitement against Israelis and Jews by Palestinians, which often could lead to terror attacks, Erdan and his colleague, Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked, proposed the so-called Facebook bill that will enable Israeli courts to issue decrees against social media companies like Facebook, Google or Twitter to remove public content deemed to be a threat to national security, public security, or a violation of the law, in case the social media company failed to detect and remove the contect on its own. The bill has been criticized for allegedly limiting free speech online. However, following the submission of the bill, a senior delegation from Facebook arrived in Israel to meet with Erdan, agreeing to work together in order to improve the detection and removal of inciting material online. in 2018, Erdan initiated new legislation intended to partially de-criminalize the use of Cannabis for recreational purposes. The reform, which was recommended by a professional committee appointed by Erdan, was called \\"Responsible Decriminalization\\", since it didn't go all the way to legalize Cannabis, but instead made private recreational use punishable by fines. The rationale for this move, explained Erdan, was to prevent unnecessary arrests and criminal records on one hand, while retaining deterrence from usage of Cannabis in the public sphere. \\"The current policy has failed and has not caused a decrease in the use of drugs. Cannabis is a dangerous drug, and there has been a significant increase in its use.... But the right way to operate is via the path of education, prevention and rehabilitation rather than criminal enforcement against regular citizens.\\" Minister Erdan also established The Child Online Protection Bureau which created a hotline (#105) and intelligence agency to protect children and teens online. The first of its kind in the world, 105 hotline brought together an interdisciplinary team of experts from the Police, Justice Department, Welfare and Education Ministries. They have been able to successfully identify and prosecute predators, stop bullying, shaming, and online violence. On 11 May 2020, following the 2020 elections to the Knesset, Prime-Minister Netanyahu announced that Erdan would become Israel's next Ambassador to the UN and also become Israel's Ambassador to the United States after the 2020 presidential election. The last person to hold those two positions concurrently, was the diplomat and politician Abba Eban, in the 50's. On 17 May 2020, Erdan was sworn in as Regional Cooperation Minister of Israel in the 35th Government.https://www.haaretz.com/israel- news/elections/.premium-israel-s-biggest-government-set-to-be-sworn-in-this- is-what-it-would-look-like-1.8845810 However, his appointment was short-lived, as he was made Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations and the Israeli ambassador to the United States.Netanyahu Appoints Likud Minister Gilad Erdan as Israel's Ambassador to Both U.S., UN Haaretz, 5 July 2020 Public activities Outside the Knesset, Erdan was elected in 2005 as chairman of Al Sam, a non-governmental non-profit organization dealing with drug issues of youths (he also served on the Knesset's Committee on Drug Abuse), and also established the Lobby for Soldiers Missing in Action. Erdan was also a member of the Israel Broadcasting Authority's General Assembly.

The pack test is intentionally stressful as it tests the capacity of muscular strength and aerobic endurance of the firefighter. There are three tests known as arduous, moderate, and light. The pack test may be given as part of the S-130/S-190 basic wildland firefighter course. The pack test replaced as of the late 1990s an earlier physical fitness test called the step test, which measured physical fitness based on beginning and ending heart rate after a short workout on a set of stairs. It was believed that the pack test more accurately measures the ability to perform arduous labor for a sustained period of time (e.g. 45 minutes) than the step test. Besides the U.S. Forest Service, all other federal and most other state and private agencies also use the pack test although there are a few state and private agencies which still use the step test. Pre-test training Before a firefighter can begin training for the test, they must fill out a Health Screening Questionnaire (HSQ). This must be done prior to conditioning for, or taking, any level of the Work Capacity Tests (WCT). The HSQ is reviewed by a Human Resource Office and they will determine whether a person is cleared to start conditioning. This is very important because heart attacks due to stressful physical activity are a leading cause of firefighter deaths on the firelines. Once cleared for training, the firefighter will need to train a minimum of 4 weeks before the test with the boots and gear needed for the job. It is recommended that the firefighter train for the arduous test by building up their aerobic fitness, first by hiking 3 miles with no pack, then by jogging on a flat course without a pack, then later add the pack and hike hills to build leg strength. Increase weight slowly until the firefighter can hike 3 miles in 45 minutes while carrying 45 pounds. Arduous pack test Arduous: involves field work calling for above-average endurance and superior conditioning. All firefighters are required to perform arduous duty. This test level is required by the U.S. Forest Service and most other agencies to fight fire in the United States. Also in the Australian States of NSW, Vic and Tas for Arduous Duty and Remote Area Firefighters. Requirements: 3-mile hike with 45 lb pack in 45 minutes. No jogging or running. Moderate field test Moderate: involves field work requiring complete control of physical faculties and may include considerable walking, standing, and lifting 25-50 lbs. Safety officers and fire behavior analysts are examples of moderate duty positions. This test level is accepted by most states and by the U.S. Forest Service under some cooperative agreements. Requirements: 2-mile walk with 25 lb pack in 30 minutes. No jogging or running. Light walk test Light: involves mainly office-type work with occasional field activity. Examples include staging area and helibase managers. Although it is part of the pack test, there is no pack for the light test. Requirements: 1-mile hike with no pack in 16 minutes. No jogging or running. Warning The USFS warns that \\"before you begin to train for testing or substantially increase your level of activity, consult your physician. This is especially important if you are over 40 and have been inactive, have a history of a heart condition or chest pain or loss of balance, or have a joint or bone problem that could be made worse by a change in physical activity.\\" References *http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/safety/wct/2002/pack_test_info_sheet.pdf *http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/safety/wct/wct_index.html *http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/safety/wct/pdf03512805dpi300.pdf Category:Fitness tests Category:Wildland fire suppression ","title":"Work Capacity Test"},{"id":"7954742","text":"Nokia 6020 Power (3,5 mm) and data connectors Power button Push to Talk button.

The trap jaw consists of mandibles which contain a spring-loaded catch mechanism. This mechanism permits the ants to accumulate energy before striking or releasing the mandibles rapidly. O. bauri is known for its powerful mandibles, which can open up to about 180¬∞ and within 10 ms of being stimulated and can close within 0.5 ms, which help with catching prey. The mandibles are able to sting and paralyze prey or crush prey to death. O. bauri also uses its mandibles to propel itself or prey off of the ground either vertically or horizontally. O. bauri can travel over 20 times their body length in a single jaw-propelled leap. O. bauri is closely related to the genus Anochetus which is in the same family, Formicidae. It has been discovered from southern Costa Rica throughout tropical South America, the West Indies (except Cuba and Bahamas), and on the Galapagos Islands. Identification O. bauri‚Äòs main feature is its dark brown color. Additionally, the face to the near margin of vertex is striated. The head is long. There is pubescence or hair on the first gastral tergum and is partially found standing straight up and relatively uniform. The petiolar node (B on Figure 2) is dome-shaped when seen from the side. The larvae of this species are ornamented with spines and adhesive pads, like others in the genus, however present a few unique features regarding minute sensilla and the relative size of structures. They undergo three larval stages before moulting, without spinning a cocoon. Habitat O. bauri is found from southern Costa Rica throughout tropical South America, the West Indies (except Cuba and the Bahamas), on the Galapagos Islands, and the north of Mexico. It is also one of the most common ants around homes and gardens in Southern Brazil. O. bauri is most often discovered in lowlands usually residing in tropical rainforests, although the species appears more tolerant of dry conditions than many other Odontomachus species. O. bauri typically forms nests in soft and humid grounds in areas protected from direct sunlight and areas where there is a low chance of disturbance by nature, i.e. wind, rain etc. One may be able to find nests under rocks, branches, and trunks of fallen trees. Additionally, if they are found in gardens, they are usually under rocks, plant containers, and vegetable residues. Foraging behavior O. bauri has a polydomous nest structure in which there are multiple nests for a single colony. This characteristic was confirmed when researchers observed that many neighboring nests do not fight with one another, but nests which are more than apart would be highly aggressive towards one another. Additionally, there were many times which observers saw trap jaw ants sharing food amongst their neighbors. Nests are usually small, roughly less than 200 ants. The foraging areas between each family of nests are strictly defined. O. bauri has been observed staying within the same area while foraging, because it would not dare step into its neighbor's foraging area. O. bauri usually spends its time below the leaf litter, classifying it as a leaf-litter ant. It is also widely known as a generalist predator. A few of O. bauri‚Äôs common prey include worms, spiders, termites, ants, butterflies, flies, and beetles. Usually prey would be around 3 mm and 4 mm in length. The most common prey O. bauri enjoys are soft bodied, for example, termites and wood lice. O. bauri is able to ‚Äúexploit a food resource largely unavailable to other ants‚Äù. This was determined after a researcher found remnants of Nasuitermes a type of termite that as a defense will discharge material that irritates and can block the predator's sensory organs. Finding parts of this type of termite prove that the mandibles of O. bauri are able to combat prey which is chemically protected. Workers are observed returning to places where they had previously found food. The foraging success for an individual, which is measured by how many workers return with prey, would be 28%. About 41% of the workers who were returning from foraging were empty handed and the other 31% had no prey or the prey was too small to be distinguished. Speed O. bauri have the second- fastest moving predatory appendages within the animal kingdom, after the dracula ant (Mystrium camillae). After stimulation of one of the four trigger hairs, the appendage of O. bauri will respond within 10ms. It has peak speeds of , with the jaws closing within just 130 microseconds on average. This is about 2300 times faster than the blink of an eye. The peak force exerted was in the order of 300 times the body weight of the ant. The ants were also observed using their jaws as catapults to eject intruders or fling themselves backwards to escape a threat. The biology behind this amazing ability is that when one trigger hair is stimulated, it actually causes all four large motor neurons to become active. These large motor neurons are fully covered in a glial sheath which is a group of specialized cells that nourish and support neurons. A glial sheath is essential for sending signals at a fast rate, because it allows for a single smooth road rather than having the signal jump from neuron to neuron. The mandibles are controlled by the stimulation of two large sensory neurons that project through the sensory mandibular nerve into the suboesophageal ganglion. To operate the mandible muscles, the ends of the sensory neurons lead to the thick dendritic trunks of the four motor neurons. The mandibles of O. bauri are kept in place with a latch called the clypeus. Once the latch is released, all of the energy stored is quickly released and the mandibles close, very similar to a crossbow when fired. The trigger muscles found in O. bauri are also found in the fastest synchronous muscles of cicadas. The muscles appear to have been sculpted for fast contraction. This is because the sarcomere length, which is the fundamental unit of muscle structure, is similar in length. Jumping Records O. bauri typically uses its appendages in capturing prey. However, it may also be used in propelling its body into the air and this may result in two different types of jumps. A ‚Äúbouncer-defense jump‚Äù is when O. bauri throws itself backwards away from the potential prey due to the mandibles striking an upright object. An ‚Äúescape jump‚Äù involves O. bauri positioning its jaws towards the ground before firing and is launched vertically into the air. Additionally, to distinguish an escape jump from a bouncer-defense jump, O. bauri will orient its head in a particular manner. ‚ÄúBouncer-defense jumps‚Äù are looked upon as mere accidents rather than purposeful acts performed by the trap-jaw ant. This is because they most frequently execute this jump when there are faced with a large harmless prey rather than with small prey. This evidence concludes that this type of jump is produced by a non-penetrating strike. ‚ÄúBouncer-defense jumps‚Äù are usually horizontal jumps which can lead to the ant to land anywhere 40 centimeters away from its original position. On the other hand, ‚Äúescape jumps‚Äù propel the ant vertically and are proved to be intentional because of the behaviors that precede the jump. Before an ‚Äúescape jump,‚Äù the ant will orient its antennae and head perpendicularly to the intruder. Additionally it will sway its entire body and then lift one leg vertically. This is quite an elaborate routine to prepare to propel itself 7 cm off of the ground. The reason behind this maneuver is to be able to grab onto vegetation usually located around their nests in order to provide a form of escape. Alarm and defense O. bauri is a very aggressive species of ant. Once its nest is disturbed there are many worker ants performing the escape jump. If one lands on the intruder, then the workers immediately began stinging the prowler. Fortunately for the intruder, only a few of the workers in the nest will participate in stinging the intruder unlike ant species from the genus Solenopsis. The bites are not severe for humans, but they do produce an allergic reaction. Their venom is thought to be essentially proteinaceous in composition. Trap-jaw ants do not have similar stingers as bees. Instead, their stings are retractable and not barbed in order to be used again. The sting is located at the end of the abdomen and is completely covered by a sheath, a protective covering. Besides the momentary sting from the bite, O. bauri contains a mixture of formic acid and protein, which may have a high toxic activity, and is discharged after the ant bite. Within humans, there have been records of immediate burning at the site of the sting but that usually dissipates after an hour. However, there was one case in which a young girl had an intense allergic reaction to the bite. There were patches of red, itchy, swollen areas on her hands, arms, thorax and foot. Additionally, her eyelids were swollen. This lasted about a week and has been discovered in about 16% of ant bites. Recognition O. bauri is able to recognize other workers from different nests by antennation. This process happens when two ants are front to front of one another, and either one is touching the other's antennae with their antennae or head. There are four different behavioral patterns that may result after recognition of the other ant. These are basic alertness, alarm, attack with mandibles or attack with sting. Basic alertness occurs when both ants open their mandibles to about 180¬∞. Alarm is composed of both basic alertness with fast random body movements and release of alarm pheromone. Attack with mandibles is a pattern in which the trap jaw ant will use its mandibles in order to strike a blow to the opponent. Attack with sting is when the trap jaw ant will bend its abdomen forward and try to use its sting to hurt the opponent. O. bauri ants use a volatile substance, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to recognize their nestmates. Individuals from different colonies have different amounts of volatile chemicals within its system so the cue to knowing one's relative is the amount of substance captured during antennation. The recognition signal does not pertain to environmental cues, since O. bauri attacked ants which were kept in the colony surrounded by a wire mesh capsule more than the controls, which were kept inside the colony. To further rule out environmental cues as an option, Jaffe et al. fed two different colonies the same diet and fed a single colony two different diets. When the trap jaw ants from the single colony but different diets met they did not attack each other. However, when the ants from two different colonies but same diets met they attacked each other roughly 75% of the time. Additionally, the recognition signal is not a sound or a particular behavior since O. bauri is able to recognize dead nestmates. The recognition signal must be a type of smell, since ants which were freeze dried or in a plastic wire mesh capsule were never attacked. Evolution The mandibles of O. bauri are an exaggerated form of the sturdy and long mandibles found in many ant species. Additionally, the muscles found in the mandibles of O. bauri are found in other ants, although those found in O. bauri are large and look very similar to those found in cicadas. The mandibles and the muscles found in the mandibles are exaptations, the large mandibles probably were selected for the increased ability to carry food, and further modified to use as a way of defense and hunting. There are other ants with trap-jaws such as the extant Strumigenys, Mystrium, Myrmoteras and Anochetus along with the extinct Cretaceous age tribe Haidomyrmecini. One commonly accepted theory suggests that the trap-jaw actually evolved independently at least four different times in ants‚Äô history. This is because with the use of DNA sequencing, the phylogenetic tree which found that those ants with trap-jaws were not nested neatly in one portion of the tree. Instead they were found scattered around the tree. Therefore, it did not evolve once leading to the hypothesis of a common ancestor. Instead it evolved multiple times and each time it evolved it used a different feature of the ant's mouth to produce the trap jaw. For instance, O. bauri‚Äôs trap jaw is built from the mandible joint; however, Strumigenys trigger is built from it upper lip. This type of evolution would be deemed as convergent evolution and the trap jaw would be considered an analogy. This is because they are all similar features but involved independently rather than a common ancestor.

J. Simpson, in which Simpson puts forth a hypothetical description of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Simpson's former manager, Norman Pardo, claimed that Simpson was not involved in writing the book, but rather accepted, against Pardo's advice, $600,000 from ReganBooks and News Corporation to say he had written it and to conduct an interview. Simpson was acquitted of the murders in a criminal trial (California v. Simpson) but later was found financially liable in a civil trial. Although the original release of the book was cancelled shortly after it was announced in November 2006, 400,000 physical copies of the original book were printed, and by June 2007, copies of it had been leaked online. The book was originally due to be published by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins, which was headed by editor and publisher Judith Regan. The television network Fox, which was a sister to HarperCollins via News Corporation at the time, was to also broadcast an interview special with Simpson to promote the book, entitled O. J. Simpson: If I Did It, Here's How It Happened. However, following objections to the special by several Fox station owners, the special was also canceled. Footage from the interview was aired, for the first time, during a subsequent Fox special, O. J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?, which aired in March 2018. In August 2007, a Florida bankruptcy court awarded the rights to the book to the Goldman family to partially satisfy the civil judgment. The book's title was changed to If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, and this version was published by Beaufort Books, a New York City publishing house owned by parent company Kampmann & Company/Midpoint Trade Books. Comments were added to the original manuscript by the Goldman family, Fenjves, and journalist Dominick Dunne. The new cover design printed the word \\"If\\" greatly reduced in size compared with the other words, and placed inside the word \\"I\\".  Authorship  Norman Pardo, Simpson's former manager, told The Huffington Post that the book was written by a ghostwriter without Simpson's involvement. Rather, Simpson had accepted, against Pardo's advice, $600,000 from the publisher ReganBooks and its parent company News Corporation to say he had written the book and to conduct an associated television interview on Fox. Pardo told the Huffington Post that Simpson had rationalized: > \\"Hey, they offered me $600,000 not to dispute that I [wrote] the book.\\" He > said, \\"That's cash.\\" I said, \\"They're going to think you wrote it.\\" He said, > \\"So? Everybody thinks I'm a murderer anyway. They're not going to change > their mind just because of a book.\\" The book's ghostwriter and 1995 trial witness, Pablo Fenjves, responded to the claim, saying the book is \\"based on extensive discussions with Simpson.\\"  Content  The first part of the If I Did It manuscript details Simpson's early relationship and marriage with Nicole Brown Simpson. The latter part of the manuscript describes details of the events on June 12, 1994, and about the murders as they could have occurred if Simpson had committed them. However, Simpson's attorney said that there is \\"only one chapter that deals with their deaths and that chapter, in my understanding, has a disclaimer that it's complete fiction.\\" In Simpson's hypothetical scenario, he has an unwilling accomplice named \\"Charlie\\" who tells him to stop the murders, and whom Simpson ignores.  First release and its cancellation  Original first release cover The book was unofficially announced in the National Enquirer in late October 2006,No Juice-y Book, Lawyer Says but this was immediately denied by Simpson's lawyer. The book was then formally announced some weeks later in mid-November 2006 for release on November 30. Intense public criticism led to the cancellation of the book's publication and a related television interview, both from divisions of News Corporation (Fox and HarperCollins, of which ReganBooks was an imprint). According to a Newsweek story, all 400,000 printed copies were recalled for \\"pulping\\", except for one, locked away in a vault at News Corporation. A copy later appeared in an auction listing on eBay in September 2007; it eventually sold for over $250,000. James Wolcott of Vanity Fair also obtained a \\"pristine hardcover\\" copy of the book for a review published in January 2007. The first version's cover, as released by HarperCollins, showed a photograph of Simpson with the words \\"I Did It\\" in red and the word \\"If\\" in white.Norfolk Fox affiliate won't show O.J. Simpson interview  HamptonRoads.com  PilotOnline.com The Beaufort version had the words \\"I Did It\\" in large type and the word \\"If\\" written in a tiny font and placed at the top of the \\"I\\". Neither version of the book has Simpson's name anywhere on the front cover. HarperCollins and ReganBooks had planned to publish the book on November 30, 2006. The National Enquirer made unproven claims in October 2006 that Simpson would be paid US$3.5 million for the book. Judith Regan, the editor of ReganBooks and Simpson's interviewer in the planned Fox special, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying, \\"This is a historic case, and I consider this his confession.\\" In one portion of an interview to promote the book, taped before the project was canceled, Regan said to Simpson, \\"You wrote, 'I have never seen so much blood in my life.'\\" Simpson responded, \\"I don't think any two people could be murdered without everybody being covered in blood.\\" = Pre-publication controversy = If I Did It ignited a storm of pre-publication controversy, largely due to the perception that Simpson was trying to profit from the two deaths for which his civil suit verdict had found him liable. \\"This is not about being heard. This is about trying to cash in, in a pathetic way, on some notoriety,\\" said Sara Nelson, editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly. Patricia Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Association of American Publishers, felt that the book would \\"stir an awful lot of debate and make the culture take a real look at itself, and that may not be unhealthy\\". Denise Brown, sister of murder victim Nicole Brown Simpson, expressed her hope that the publisher would take \\"full accountability for promoting the wrongdoing of criminals and leveraging this forum and the actions of Simpson to commercialize abuse.\\" She went on to say that Simpson's two children would be \\"exposed to [his] inexplicable behavior and we will provide them with our love and support during this time. It's unfortunate that [O.J.] Simpson has decided to awaken a nightmare that we have painfully endured and worked so hard to move beyond.\\" The proposed book also outraged the family of Ron Goldman, who criticized the publisher for \\"helping a murderer get his voice out there.\\" According to lawyers for the family, they planned to attempt to garnish any earnings Simpson might get from the book. Fred Goldman, Ron's father, was awarded $33.5 million by a jury in 1997 for the wrongful death of his son. However, Simpson never paid this judgment due to a California law that prevents pensions from being used to satisfy judgments, and the fact that the bulk of his income comes from his NFL pension. Goldman described the book and television interview as \\"an all-time low\\" and \\"morally reprehensible to me ... to think you are willing to give somebody airtime about how they would murder two people.\\" The day after the announcement of its publication, an online boycott encouraged Americans to ignore the book and complain to publishers and booksellers. Similar boycotts were held in Australia and Europe. Within four days of the book's announcement, over 58,394 people had signed an online petition developed by Goldman's family, DontPayOJ.com, declaring their opposition to the book. Bookshops were divided about stocking the title in their stores. Numerous independent stores said either that they would not sell it or would offer limited copies and give away the proceeds. Borders Books and Waldenbooks said they would donate any profits made from the book to charities which would benefit victims of domestic violence, and a Borders spokesperson said they \\"believe it is the right of customers to decide what they read and what to buy, but we will not discount the title or promote it\\". Several stores in Canada said they would only order it for customers, but not stock it. In the days following the book's announcement, pre-orders put it in the top 20 of Amazon.com's bestseller list, though it had fallen to #51 when the book's cancellation was announced. Legal experts theorized that Simpson might be able to avoid paying the Goldmans or Browns any money. \\"I think it's going to be difficult if [Simpson] arranges to have [book profits] deposited abroad,\\" said lawyer Tom Mesereau. \\"It's one thing to enforce a judgment in America, and another to enforce it overseas.\\" Mesereau said Simpson also might have profits \\"paid into a trust offshore or a corporation in a different name.\\" = Fox television interview = Fox, a U.S. television network that was a sister to HarperCollins via News Corporation at the time, was to air a related, two- part, taped interview with Simpson, conducted by Regan, in which Simpson describes how he would have committed the 1994 slayings of Nicole and Goldman, \\"if he were the one responsible\\". The interview was scheduled to air on November 27 and November 29, 2006, timed to coincide with the book's release. The program was being produced under Fox's alternative programming department, headed by Mike Darnell, and not under the auspices of Fox News Channel. NBC said that it was approached to air the interview, but declined, saying, \\"This is not a project appropriate for our network.\\" On November 16, 2006, Regan issued a statement claiming that her reason for recording the interview and releasing the book was an attempt to find closure after having been a battered woman herself. \\"The men who lied and cheated and beat me ‚Äì they were all there in the room,\\" she said. \\"And the people who denied it, they were there, too. And though it might sound a little strange, Nicole and Ron were in my heart. And for them I wanted him to confess his sins, do penance, and to amend his life. Amen.\\" Over a dozen Fox affiliates refused to carry the special, or decided to air it, but devote local advertising time to public service announcements. KSFX-TV in Springfield, Missouri, and WWCP-TV in Johnstown- Altoona-State College, Pennsylvania area were the first to turn down the special on November 17, 2006, along with KAYU-TV in Spokane, Washington, and WDRB in Louisville, Kentucky. Pappas Telecasting also planned to pre-empt the program on their Fox stations in four markets along with Fox affiliates KNDX in Bismarck-Minot, North Dakota; KMPH-TV in Fresno, California; KPTH in Sioux City, Iowa; KTVG-TV in Lincoln, Superior and Grand Island, Nebraska; and KPTM in Omaha, Nebraska. Fox affiliates KCPQ in Seattle‚Äîowned by Tribune Company‚Äîand XETV in San Diego/Tijuana‚Äîwere both reportedly undecided, but each indicated that if they aired the special, they would not sell local ad time, instead giving that time to local domestic violence groups to air public service announcements.Source for XETV: More Fox Affiliates Kill O.J. Special, Jim Benson and Caroline Palmer, Broadcasting & Cable, November 20, 2006 = Ghostwriter = Fenjves, a screenwriter and witness at Simpson's 1995 trial, ghostwrote Simpson's book. Fenjves stated in interviews that Simpson actively collaborated on the manuscript, and that Fenjves \\"knew\\" Simpson was \\"a murderer\\". = Project cancellation = On November 20, 2006, News Corporation issued a statement saying that the book and television special had been cancelled. In the statement, News Corporation chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch said, \\"I and senior management agree with the American public that this was an ill-considered project. We are sorry for any pain this has caused the families of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown-Simpson.\\" The Associated Press called the book's cancellation \\"an astonishing end to a story like no other,\\" noting that a publisher's withdrawing a book for its content \\"is virtually unheard of.\\" On November 21, 2006, Denise Brown accused Fox of trying to stop the Goldman and Brown families from criticizing the project by offering millions of dollars for their silence surrounding the project: \\"They wanted to offer us millions of dollars. Millions of dollars for, like, 'Oh, I'm sorry' money. But they were still going to air the show,\\" Brown said. \\"We just thought, 'Oh my God.' What they're trying to do is trying to keep us quiet, trying to make this like hush money, trying to go around the civil verdict, giving us this money to keep our mouths shut.\\" Brown told NBC's Today that her family's response was: \\"Absolutely not.\\" Fox confirmed that the Brown and Goldman families were offered profit participation deals for the projects but denies that it was hush money. \\"Last week, when concerns were raised by the public that we were profiting from this guy's story, we tried to work out some arrangement with the family. Never was there any suggestion of them being barred from talking about it. We would never suggest that,\\" said News Corp spokesman Andrew Butcher. Since the interview existed on tape, executives at Fox said it was likely to turn up somewhere or be leaked. Nearly twelve years later, Fox announced that it would air a special entitled O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?, on March 11, 2018. It featured footage from the interview, as well as analysis and discussion by host Soledad O'Brien and experts. It aired with limited commercial time, which was used to broadcast public service announcements addressing domestic violence. In the decade-old interview, Simpson initially used phrases like \\"I would\\" and \\"I'd think\\" in his hypothetical description of the event, but later moved to using first-person phrasing with sentences like \\"I remember I grabbed the knife\\", \\"I don't remember except I'm standing there\\", \\"I don't recall\\", and \\"I must have.\\" Due to the change in phrasing, these comments were interpreted by many as being a form of confession, which stirred strong reactions in print media and the internet.  Republication  On August 14, 2007, it was reported that a literary agent for the Goldman family, Sharlene Martin, had made a deal to publish the book with the new subtitle \\"Confessions of the Killer\\".\\"O.J.

Barclay Road CEO Herbert Becker said that public opinion turned against the book without anybody's really knowing its contents. He said his company would look into obtaining the rights to the book. = Transfer of rights = In June 2007, a federal judge ruled that Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman's father, could pursue the publishing rights to Simpson's book. In July 2007, a federal bankruptcy judge awarded the rights to the book to the Goldman family, who receive 90 percent of profits to help satisfy the $33.5 million wrongful death civil suit judgment against Simpson. After Goldman had won the rights to the book, he arranged to publish it under the new title If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer. The Goldman family's lawyers also announced intentions to pursue new publishing, film, or TV deals in order to receive some of $33.5 million awarded to them in the civil case. = Lawsuits = Fred Goldman sued Lorraine Brooke Associates, a shell corporation, for the publishing rights after it filed for bankruptcy. After Goldman purchased the rights from the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, Nicole's father, Louis H. Brown, sued Goldman, attempting to stop the publication, but lost.

The faculty also comprises the School of Architecture and the School of Urban Planning, and teaches courses in bio- resource engineering (Faculty of Agriculture) and biomedical engineering (Faculty of Medicine) at the master's level.  History  = 1855-1900 = Dawson Lectures (1855) Thirty years before the construction of Engineering's two original edifices; McGill had been offering lectures in Applied Sciences. This series of lectures was started in 1855 by William Dawson, a renowned geologist and McGill's fifth principal which was offered within the Faculty of Arts until the formation of the Department of Applied Sciences in 1871. Dawson accepted the offer, but he traveled to Britain first and while there delivered several papers at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Eventually, the lectures formed the core of a two-year curriculum leading to a Diploma in Civil Engineering. First Engineering Buildings (1893) For the first time in the history of McGill, buildings are constructed specifically to house engineers. The imposing Macdonald Engineering Building and the more modest Workman Technical Shops were both designed by architect Sir Andrew Taylor and his partner, William Gordon. Featuring a symmetrical Italian Renaissance facade and a Montreal limestone exterior, the five-storey Macdonald building is equipped to meet every conceivable need. Among the facilities housed on its five floors are an apparatus museum, a library, a forge, a foundry, and a dynamo and engine room. = 1900-1999 = Fire of the Macdonald Building and Rebuilding (1907-1909) On April 5, 1907, the Macdonald Engineering Building burns. Everything in it, except the contents of the ground floor laboratories, is destroyed. Fortunately, the fire doors that were built in the adjoining Workman Technical Shops (commonly referred to as the Workman Wing) do their job, keeping the building intact and sparing it from significant damage. Less than a week earlier the old Medical Building had burned down. Some of the stone salvaged from this fire was used to add a fourth floor to the Workman shops. The Faculty's sponsor, Sir William Macdonald, again stepped forward, this time volunteering to contribute to build a new structure on the foundation of its predecessor. Percy Nobbs, Director of McGill's School of Architecture is asked to design and build the new structure. The University and Macdonald both stress to him the importance of function and fire resistance. The carved phoenix rising from the flames is one of the few ornaments on a building constructed specifically for fire-proof functionality. Although the phoenix is easy to overlook, the Macdonald Engineering Building is a mainstay on the east side of McGill's downtown campus. Faculty of Engineering Launched (1931) The Faculty of Applied Science becomes the Faculty of Engineering in 1931. It offers two degrees ‚Äì Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) and Master of Engineering (MEng). McGill also introduces a completely revised curriculum in Chemical Engineering, to be administered by the Department of Chemistry. Dawson College Lecture Dawson College (1945) Dawson College was opened in 1945 to accommodate the greatly increased enrollment due to the return of students from the armed services and was housed at the R.C.A.F base at St-Jean, Quebec. All first year science and engineering students were transferred there. The number of students enrolled, mainly veterans, reached a peak of 1687 in January 1947. The College was closed in 1950. Dawson College was administered by a Vice- Principal, Dawson College and by various other McGill staff members who undertook duties such as that of Assistant Bursar and Secretary. First Woman to Graduate From Engineering (1946) Mary Blair Jackson (later Mary Fowler) graduates from Mechanical Engineering, McGill's first woman engineering (non- Architecture) graduate. She would go on to become a pilot officer at RCAF training command headquarters in Trenton, Ontario, where she conducted statistical work connected with the training of ground crews. The J.W. McConnell Building Is Completed (1958) Named in honour of J.W. McConnell, a Governor of the University from 1927 to 1958, the new four-storey McConnell Engineering Building is officially dedicated by Chancellor Ray Edwin Powell on October 6, 1958. The new building doubles the Faculty's space and provides much needed facilities for graduate programs. Center for Intelligent Machines (1985) With a grant from the Qu√©bec Minist√®re de l‚ÄôEnseignement Sup√©rieur et de la Science, four researchers ‚Äì Martin Levin, Steve Zucker, Pierre B√©langer, and George Zames (BEng Engineering Physics 1954)‚Äì form McRCIM (the McGill Research Centre for Intelligent Machines), now known as the Centre for Intelligent Machines, to study intelligent systems. CIM seeks to advance the state of knowledge in such domains as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence, computer vision, systems and control theory, and speech recognition. The M.H. Wong Building Reaches Completion (1997) The new M.H. Wong Building ‚Äì the first new major academic construction on McGill's downtown campus in almost 20 years ‚Äì is erected around the Foster Radiation Laboratory (built in 1948). The building, which became the new home of the Departments of Chemical and Mining, Metals, and Materials Engineering cost close to $34 million, $12 million of which came from private donations. The largest of these was a gift of $8 million from the family and friends of the late Man Hung (Jimmy) Wong (BArch 1981). Another anonymous donor from Hong Kong contributed $1.9 million in honour of the late Chemical Engineering professor J.B. Philips. = 2000- Present = Philanthropist Lorne Trottier Makes Transformative Gift (2000) Quebec entrepreneur Lorne Trottier announced a gift of $5 million to help build a new Information Technology undergraduate teaching facility at McGill, estimated at a cost of $17 million. The government of Quebec announced that it will provide $7 million to complete the Lorne M. Trottier Building, prompting Trottier to double his gift to $10 million. In 2003, the Lorne M. Trottier Building opened in September. The building houses six floors of advanced teaching laboratories, interactive learning rooms and meeting spaces and is equipped with all of the latest high- tech equipment. School of Architecture Receives Landmark Gift (2017) Through a gift from McGill alumnus Peter Guo-hua Fu, the School of Architecture is renamed the Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture. His gift will support the full range of architecture education at McGill, creating new learning and research opportunities that will position the school and its students for a vibrant future. One portion of the gift will be used to create the Peter Guo- hua Fu Fellowships. These will be awarded, on the basis of academic merit, to graduate students entering or enrolled in the School. Preference will be given to citizens of China. Departments and Schools =Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics= The Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics (est. 1871) offers programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The Department currently has twenty-two full-time faculty members. In addition, the department enjoyed great relations with corporate partners and has many Faculty Lecturers, Associate Professors, and researchers working with students in the department. The Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics has consistently ranked in the top hundred Civil Engineering schools worldwide and top 3 in Canada. There are approximately four hundred undergraduate and eighty graduate students in the department, of whom over half are women and over one-third are from outside Canada as of 2018. Broad programs of study are available that offer specialized courses in all areas of civil engineering. Facilities include state-of-the-art teaching, research, and computing laboratories. =Department of Mining and Materials Engineering= Established in 1871, the mining engineering program is the oldest in Canada.https://www.mcgill.ca/minmat/mining/ It is the oldest program of its kind in North America. In the mid 1960s mining engineering at universities in Canada was suffering. Toronto closed its school; McGill had only one undergraduate student and its Professor of Mining was due to retire. In 1964 John Ross Bradfield, Chairman of Noranda, was asked to form a committee to study and resolve the problem. The result was the raising of funds to help finance a Chair of Mining at McGill and to persuade Professor Frank T. M. White to come from the University of Queensland in Australia to take the position of Chairman of the Department of Mining Engineering and Applied Geophysics. Professor White initiated a program that graduated a large cohort of postgraduate engineers, many of whom served to rebuild the educational capacity of mining throughout Canada. This, together with the contribution that he made in promoting mining education, resolved the crisis. Professor White died in 1971; McGill University and the Canadian Mineral Industry Education Foundation set up the F.T.M. White Award to honour him for his outstanding contribution to mining education in Canada.Canadian Mineral Industry Education Foundation. F.T.M.White Award. http://cmief.ca/english/ftm_en_txt.html Accessed Nov 11, 2015 = Department of Chemical Engineering = Over one hundred years of chemical engineering at McGill has evolved through several distinct stages. The chemical engineering curriculum, established at McGill in 1908, produced its first bachelor's degree graduate in 1911. Today, collectively, 17 members of the academic staff conduct research programs in almost all areas of modern chemical engineering, drawing upon theoretical, computational and experimental methodologies. = Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) = The department of Electrical & Computer Engineering is located in McGill's downtown Montreal campus with a student body of 900 undergraduate students, 350 graduate students, 20 staff members and 40 faculty members. ECE offers four undergraduate degrees in the areas of Electrical (including Honours), Computer and Software Engineering, all accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). Graduate studies in ECE offer a wealth of opportunities for stimulating collaborations, multidisciplinary projects and industrially relevant innovation. = Department of Bioengineering = Established in 2012, the Department of Bioengineering is the newest department to join McGill University's Faculty of Engineering. McGill researchers from nearly all Faculty units, including seven Canada Research Chairs and many colleagues in the Faculties of Medicine, Science, and Agriculture and Environmental Sciences are actively involved in various areas of Bioengineering. Within the Department, the faculty are focusing on three major directions: biological materials and mechanics; bio molecular and cellular engineering; and biomedical, diagnostics and high throughput screening. = Department of Mechanical Engineering = The department of Mechanical is located in McGill's main downtown Montreal campus and is one of the primary engineering departments. Mechanical Engineering at McGill offers students an opportunity to spend their years of study alongside some of the best students and researchers from around the world. Students come from across Canada and beyond, while professors have studied at top ranked universities worldwide. The Department offers an Honours program which is particularly suitable for those with a high aptitude in mathematics and physics and which gives a thorough grounding in the basic engineering sciences. =School of Urban Planning= The Macdonald-Harrington Building, named in honor of William Christopher Macdonald. Since 1987, the Schools of Architecture and Urban Planning have been housed in the Macdonald-Harrington Building, which was originally constructed in 1896 by Sir Andrew Taylor to accommodate the Departments of Chemistry and Mining by 1896. The building was renovated for Architecture and Urban Planning by architects Ray Affleck and Arcop Associates in 1987. McGill was the first university in Canada to offer a full-time program in urban planning. An interdisciplinary program through which students combined a master's degree in their original field was combined with urban planning was established in 1947. An autonomous program was established in 1972. In 1976, the School of Urban Planning was established as a unit within the Faculty of Engineering. The School offers three Master of Urban Planning programs (a Core Program, with a concentration in Transportation Planning, and with a Concentration in Urban Design) and a Ph.D. in Urban Planning, Policy, and Design program. Major research areas include the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA), Transportation Research at McGill (TRAM), and Whole- corridor Urban Design Strategies (WCUDS). = Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture = Founded in 1896, McGill's School of Architecture is among the oldest architecture schools in North America, offering professional and post- professional programs from undergraduate through to PhD levels. The School has established an international reputation and a record of producing leading professionals and researchers, with McGill alumni practicing and teaching in firms and institutions across the nation and the globe. It is housed in the Macdonald-Harrington Building, designed by Montreal architect Andrew Taylor. The School of Architecture has produced renowned architects, including Arthur Erickson, Moshe Safdie, Melvin Charney, Raymond Affleck, Catherine Wisnicki, Blanche van Ginkel, Witold Rybczynski, and Raymond Moriyama; leading Montreal- based architects such as Howard Davies and Anne Cormier of Atelier Big City and Annie Lebel of In Situ; Julia Gerzovitz and Alain Founier of EVOQ, Danny Pearl and Mark Poddubuik of L‚ÄôOEUF as well as contemporary international architects such as Adam Caruso (London), Amale Andraos (Work Architecture, New York), Eric Bunge (nArchitects, New York), and Todd Saunders (Bergen, Norway). On 26 September 2017, the School was renamed the Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture following a $12 million gift from Chinese architect and McGill graduate Peter Fu.  Institutes  = Institute for the Public Life of Arts and Ideas (IPLAI) = IPLAI (Institute for the Public Life of Arts and Ideas) is a collaboration among six faculties across McGill, two schools and the McGill Libraries. IPLAI's mission is to connect interdisciplinary academic research with the public world of art, policy and culture. IPLAI creates bridges between academic thought and applied public practice to bring about a world rich in both intellectual and material resources ‚Äî for pleasure, for play, for moral fulfillment, and for the betterment of humanity. = Trottier Institute for Sustainability in Engineering and Design (TISED) = TISED promotes bold and green ideas through education, outreach, and research, where we aim to connect our institution with the public for a greater understanding of sustainability issues in our society. Engineering, architecture and urban planning professionals play key roles through their involvement in everything from sustainable development and aerospace industry success, to manufacturing sector renewal, improving infrastructure, and our energy horizon. = McGill Institute for Aerospace Engineering (MIAE) = MIAE is an initiative of the Lorne Trottier Chair in Aerospace Engineering to foster interest in Aerospace Engineering among undergraduate and graduate students and awareness of the multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural environment in which they may work as future engineers working in the Aerospace Industry. Students accepted into the Institute will be given the opportunity to participate in a number of 500 to 1000 hours Research Projects proposed by the Aerospace Companies. = McGill Institute for Advance Materials (MIAM) = McGill Institute for Advance Materials was established by the Faculties of Science and Engineering to act as a focal point for research into all forms of advanced materials. Engineering innovation and materials creation have led to important developments in communications, information technology, transportation, clinical diagnosis and care, and energy generation, for example. New materials are considered by knowledge-based economies to be a precursor to many technological developments necessary for development and growth, and have been identified as one of Canada's strategic areas of research, and a priority area for McGill.  Buildings & Laboratories  Macdonald Engineering Building = Macdonald Building = When the Arts Building was becoming overcrowded in the 1890s as enrollment climbed; new faculties were added to the University Campus. The Applied Science Faculty, (which was the term used for Engineering at that time), relocated in 1893 to two new buildings. One was donated by Thomas Workman and the other by Sir William Macdonald, one of McGill's most generous benefactors. = Macdonald-Harrington Building = The Macdonald Chemistry Building, recently renamed the Macdonald-Harrington Building after its first Chemistry professor, Bernard Harrington, was built between 1896 and 1897 and was one of the many donations made to the University by Sir William Macdonald. Located in the Macdonald-Harrington Building are: Engineering Micro-computing Facilities; School of Architecture; School of Urban Planning. M. H. Wong Engineering Building = M. H. Wong Building = This edifice, donated by Mr. Wong, an alumnus of McGill's School of Architecture, preserves the atmosphere of the campus both in its size and in its materials. It is composed of two sections, the older Foster section which consists of four storeys, and a new wing north of Foster which adds another six storeys to the whole. The Foster Wing, which will be used as offices, has had classrooms and labs added to both its west side and the top of the building, designated for Metallurgical Engineering labs. The new wing is used for Chemical Engineering labs. = McConnell Engineering Building = The McConnell Engineering Building was donated to McGill in 1959 by John W. McConnell, a major benefactor of the University since 1911 and one of its Governors from 1928 until 1958. In the period after World War II when all of the Engineering Faculties were greatly expanding, this nine-storey structure doubled the number of classrooms, lecture rooms, and offices available for use by the above faculties. Lorne M. Trottier Engineering Building = Frank Dawson Adams Building = The Physical Sciences Centre was renamed the \\"Frank Dawson Adams Building\\" after a professor of Geology who was the first chairman of Graduate Studies, and also served as Vice Principal from 1920 to 1924. The building was completed in October 1951. = Lorne M. Trottier Building = The Lorne M. Trottier Building was inaugurated on March 26, 2004. This building is part of the TechSquare and will allow the University to expand its popular electrical engineering, computer science and telecommunications programs.

It was the home of the 2010 Winter Olympics's Whistler Olympic Park, the venue for the Nordic events of the Olympics, and adventure tourism operations including Canadian Wilderness Adventures. Geography The valley is the basin of Callaghan Creek, at the head of which is Callaghan Lake and associated provincial park. Midway down Callaghan Creek is the confluence of Madeley Creek, just above which on that creek is Alexander Falls, which lies just at a bridge on the road to Callaghan Lake. On its western perimeter is the Powder Mountain Icefield, and the potentially active volcano Mount Cayley, which lies at the valley's southwestern extremity. Mount Callaghan, at the head of the valley, is a dormant volcano because its last eruption was not as recent as Mount Cayley's, nor does it display hot spring or seismic activity. The valley's eastern wall is the small range formed by Mount Sproatt and Rainbow Mountain, which lies in the angle of the Cheakamus River and Callaghan Creek (which in the past has also been known as the West Fork of the Cheakamus) and east of which is the Resort Municipality of Whistler. The valley's mouth and road access is at McGuire's on BC Highway 99, 14 kilometres south of downtown Whistler, in British Columbia. The location is also known as Northair, and the road as the Northair Mine Road, after a mine located a few miles north of the junction, which is marked by a quarry pit columnar basalt lava rock on the opposite side of the highway, and which are the northern end of a small lava plateau between the highway and river south to and including Brandywine Falls. Volcanoes in the Callaghan Valley were erupted between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago whose age is extremely young in the geologic record.Callaghan Lake Provincial Park: Background Report Development history The Callaghan Valley is a unique microclimate surrounded by a circular rampart of five mountains. Recent commercial snow sports developments have completely altered this ecosystem and these changes are increasingly having an impact on it.

Despite its name, the Daily has reduced its print publication to once a week, normally on Mondays, in addition to producing online-only content and weekly radio segments for CKUT 90.3 FM. The Daily was originally published daily in 1911. It began as a sports rag in the broadsheet format and has since transitioned to the compact or tabloid format, covering a wide range of issues related to the McGill and greater Montreal communities. The paper's content sections are News, Commentary, Culture, Features, Sci+Tech, Unfit to Print (radio), and Compendium!. History The Daily is one of Canada's oldest university publications, continually publishing since the early 1900s.Crighton, Claire & Ginsberg, Josh. \\"Comment: Committed to free speech since 1911\\" , \\"The McGill Daily\\", March 16, 2006. Accessed June 13, 2008. At one time, the paper was even \\"the oldest daily student newspaper in the Commonwealth\\".\\"About The McGill Daily\\" , \\"The McGill Daily\\", 2009. Accessed October 20, 2009. The Daily has been the training ground for generations of journalists since its inception in 1911. Currently the Daily is one of the largest student newspapers in Canada and is widely read both on the McGill campus and around Montreal. The Daily began as a broadsheet that focused mainly on sports news. Its evolution has taken many directions. Over the years, it has taken stands considered controversial at their times, such as publishing a special issue for International Women‚Äôs Day in the late 1970. The Daily has been independent from student government since 1980. It is published by the Daily Publications Society, an autonomous body whose membership includes all McGill downtown campus undergraduate students except Continuing Education, as well as all graduate students excluding non- residents, graduate medical and graduate dentistry students. In 2010, the Daily Publications Society proposed raising the non-opt-outable fee from $5 to $6 per semester due to declining ad revenues. A \\"No Committee\\" formed by students challenged the fee increase, saying that the money could be better spent on underfunded programs. With a high voter turnout, the referendum passed by 2.6%. Editorial staff The McGill Daily is nominally run in a non-hierarchical manner. Editors and staff members have equal voting powers and speaking privileges at editorial board meetings. Each editor is paid a monthly stipend. When the paper was twice-weekly, the amount of the stipend was determined by the frequency of each section's appearance, with editors of sections appearing once weekly receiving half of the amount received by editors of sections appearing twice weekly. With a reduction in frequency of print publication, the allocation of stipends once reflected amount of content published, with previously twice-weekly sections publishing more online-only content, and continuing to receive twice the amount of \\"half\\" sections. However, as of November 2019, all editors receive equal stipends. Past contributors Some of the Daily's notable past contributors include: *Leonard Cohen, poet and songwriter *Irwin Cotler, international human rights lawyer and Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party *Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker *Charles Krauthammer, The Washington Post and TIME columnist *Irving Layton, poet *David Lewis, Rhodes Scholar, mentor to Irving Layton, and leader of the federal New Democratic Party (1971-1975) *Albert Nerenberg, filmmaker and columnist *A.

Quest Atlantis combined strategies used in the commercial gaming environment with lessons from educational research on learning and motivation. The project was unique in its goals to combine the best aspects of learning, playing, and helping, as a means to motivate and engage students. It allowed users to travel to virtual places to perform educational activities (known as Quests), talk with other users and mentors, and build virtual personae. The project was intended to engage children ages 9‚Äì16 in a form of transformational play comprising both online and off-line learning activities, with a storyline inspiring a disposition towards social action. More than sugar-coating content to coerce dis-empowered students into caring about disciplinary knowledge, the goal of Quest Atlantis was to establish educational worlds where children become empowered scientists, doctors, reporters, and mathematicians who have to understand disciplinary content to accomplish desired ends. Over the five year span, more than 65,000 children on five continents have participated in the project. Quest Atlantis has demonstrated learning gains in science, language arts, and social studies, and students have completed thousands of Quests, some of which were assigned by teachers and many of which were chosen by students to complete in their free time. Equally important have been reported personal experiences, with teachers and students reporting increased levels of engagement and interest in pursuing the curricular issues outside of school. Students and teachers conduct rich inquiry-based explorations through which they learn particular standards-based content, and at the same time develop pro-social attitudes regarding significant environmental and social issues (see Critical Design Article). Rather than just placing work and play side-by-side, QA strived to make learning fun and to show children how they can make a difference. The principal investigator was Sasha BarabSasha Barab's Homepage, Indiana University (archived), Associate Professor in Learning Sciences, who is now at Arizona State University Center for Games and Impact. Other faculty members that played prominent roles on the project included Dan Hickey at Indiana University-Bloomington and Melissa Gresalfi at Vanderbilt University. Users of QA came together from all over the world. This educational game was redesigned in 2012 with the help of funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and re-released as Atlantis Remixed.

Three other daily English-language newspapers shuttered at various times during the second half of the 20th century. It is one of the French-speaking province's last two English-language dailies; the other is the Sherbrooke Record, which serves the anglophone community in the Eastern Townships southeast of Montreal. Founded in 1778 by Fleury Mesplet, The Gazette is Quebec's oldest daily newspaper and Canada's oldest daily newspaper still in publication. The oldest newspaper overall is the English-language Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph, which was established in 1764 and is published weekly. History Offices of The Gazette in the Dominion Square Building on Saint Catherine Street in Montreal Fleury Mesplet founded a French-language weekly newspaper called La Gazette du commerce et litt√©raire, pour la ville et district de Montr√©al on June 3, 1778. It was the first entirely French-language newspaper in Canada. The paper did not accept advertising aside for the various books that Mesplet also published. The articles were meant to promote discussion, and it focused on literature and philosophy, as well as various anecdotal articles, poems and letters. Benjamin Franklin encouraged Mesplet to found the newspaper to persuade Canadians to join the American Revolution; Mesplet, an immigrant from France, had previously lived in Philadelphia and supported the Americans when they occupied Montreal during the war. The newspaper was shut down in 1779 when Mesplet and the editor, Valentin Jautard, were arrested for sedition and imprisoned for three years. Mesplet began a second weekly, The Montreal Gazette / La Gazette de Montr√©al, on August 25, 1785, which had a dual French- English bilingual format similar to that used by the Quebec Gazette. Its offices were located in the house of Joseph Lemoyne de Longueuil on rue de la Capitale. French columns were in the left-hand column and English columns in the right-hand column. The columns were originally written in French and translated to English by Valentin Jautard, who served as editor until his death in 1787. The columns were mostly on education, religion, and literature, and after 1788 on politics. Foreign and local news made up the rest of the paper. The paper took a Voltairian and anticlerical stance, wanted Quebec to have its own legislative assembly and sought to import the principles of the French Revolution to Quebec. The newspaper also introduced advertising and announcements, taking up half of four pages. It is the direct ancestor of the current newspaper. The newspaper did well, and Mesplet's operation moved to Notre-Dame Street in 1787. Mesplet continued to operate the newspaper until his death in 1794. Following Mesplet's death, his widow published the newspaper for several issues, but the paper ceased publication soon after. Two rivals, Louis Roy and Edward Edwards fought over the right to publish the newspaper over the course of two years. Edwards eventually won the printing press and newspaper and continued operations until his assets were seized in 1808. The newspaper was then the property of James Brown for fourteen years. In 1822, it was sold to businessman Thomas Andrew Turner who converted into an English-only paper in 1822. Under Turner, The Gazette identified with the interests of anglophone business leaders in their fight with the Patriote movement. On April 25, 1849, The Gazette published a special edition in which its editor-in-chief, James Moir Ferres, called the \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" residents to arms after Royal Assent of a compensation law for Lower Canada. This was among the main events leading to the burning of the Parliament Buildings. Ferres was subsequently arrested, though soon released on bail and set free without trial. In 1968, The Gazette was acquired by the Southam newspaper chain, which owned major dailies across Canada. For many years, The Gazette was caught in a three-way fight for the English newspaper audience in Montreal with the tabloid Montreal Herald and the broadsheet Montreal Star. The Gazette was second in circulation to the Montreal Star, which sold more newspapers in the city and had a significant national reputation in the first half of the 20th century. The Montreal Herald closed in 1957, after publishing for 146 years. The Montreal Star, part of the FP Publications chain (which owned the Winnipeg Free Press and, at the time, The Globe and Mail), endured a long strike and ceased publication in 1979, less than a year after the strike was settled. Westmount of man reading The Gazette In 1988, a competing English-language daily, the Montreal Daily News, was launched. The Montreal Daily News adopted a tabloid format and introduced a Sunday edition, forcing The Gazette to respond. After the Montreal Daily News closed in 1989, after less than two years in operation, The Gazette kept its Sunday edition going until August 2010. In 1996, the Southam papers were bought by Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc. Then in August 2000, Hollinger sold the Southam newspapers, including The Gazette, to Canwest Global Communications Corp., controlled by the Winnipeg- based Asper family. In 2010, a new media group, Postmedia, bought the Gazette and other papers from the financially troubled Canwest. To celebrate its 150th anniversary, The Gazette published a facsimile of one of its earliest issues. Much effort was made to use a type of paper that imitated 18th century paper, with fake chainlines and laidlines to make the paper look old.\\"Document Doubles\\" in Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery , a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada Today Today, The Gazettes audience is primarily Quebec's English-speaking community. The Gazette is one of the three dailies published in Montreal, the other two being French- language newspapers: Le Journal de Montr√©al and Le Devoir. (La Presse is only published digitally since 2018.) In recent years, The Gazette has stepped up efforts to reach bilingual francophone professionals and adjusted its coverage accordingly. The current editor-in-chief is Lucinda Chodan and the associate managing editors are James Bassil and Jeff Blond. Final version of the paper's logotype under the title The Gazette On April 30, 2013, Postmedia Network announced that it would be eliminating the role of publisher at each of its newspapers, including The Gazette. Instead, the company's 10 newspapers was overseen by regional publishers, one each for the Pacific, the Prairies and eastern Canada. Alan Allnutt, who was the publisher of The Gazette at the time, became the regional publisher of Postmedia's Alberta and Saskatchewan papers. Gerry Nott, publisher of the Ottawa Citizen, now also oversees The Gazette, the Windsor Star and Postmedia's flagship title, the National Post. On May 5, 2014, it was announced that printing of The Gazette would be contracted out to Transcontinental Media in August 2014 and that the existing Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce facility would be closed, resulting in a loss of 54 full- time and 61 part-time positions at the paper. The August 16, 2014 issue was the final issue printed by the Postmedia-owned facility. On October 21, 2014, The Gazette was relaunched as part of the Postmedia Reimagined project, adopting a similar look, and a similar suite of digital platforms, to its sister paper, the Ottawa Citizen, which had relaunched earlier in the year. As part of the relaunch, the paper was officially renamed the Montreal Gazette, reflecting its longstanding common name outside its city of publication (as well as its Web domain, montrealgazette.com). The paper had not included Montreal in its masthead in several years. The new typeface and style introduced with the rename has been criticized as being \\"sub-par\\".

There are various levels of complexity used by players when referring to such positions, and there is no official or universal set of player positions.  Tournaments  Speedball teams typically consist of three to seven players in various positions:http://en.allexperts.com/q/Paintball-1819/2008/1/speedball- positions.htm Fronts (or \\"Frontman\\") ‚Äì players assigned to the bunkers furthest up the field off the break. The position can also include the Snake player who is assigned to the \\"snake\\" bunker specifically. A front man typically doesn't shoot off the break, simply running and diving for the furthermost downfield position. The 'snake' typically is the most influential element on the NXL/X-Ball tournament field. Speed and agility are two traits that work exceptionally well for a front player. Frontmen typically shoot the most players and use the least amount of paint since they have the most advantageous angles. There are typically not more than one or two front players on a team. Mid-players ‚Äì players assigned to the bunkers between the front and back players. They can also be \\"Insert\\", players, assigned the role of filling in the spot of key teammates that are eliminated. Mid-Players are also known as the 2. The mid is considered one of the most difficult positions to play in tournament paintball because he has to be a jack of all trades. A mid can fire while moving, he can slide into the snake, and he can make lanes. There are typically no more than 2 mid-players on a team. Floater ‚Äì The floaters are the roamers. Floaters are very quick and able roam around in the paintball field providing support to his teammates. They are also the ones who will take over in case one of them is hit. Thus, you must be experienced in playing various positions.Floater Position February 18, 2017. Back players (or simply \\"backs\\") ‚Äì players usually assigned to the row of bunkers closest to the starting point (such as the home bunker). The Back players fires 'lanes' that suppress and take opposing players off the break while the mid and front players move. Back players sometimes carry as much as a 2,000 balls in their pod packs so they can consistently suppress opposing players. There are typically no more than 2 back-players on a team. Insert players (or \\"inserts\\")- these are the type of players who can fill in anywhere needed. They can start out as a back player, and as a snake player is eliminated, can rush forward to where the eliminated player was and take control from there.  Scenario-specific roles and classes  In Scenario paintball games, players are often assigned positions which they will then need to fulfill as part of the given scenario. These roles can be seen as different from team positions in that they are generally temporary roles only held by a player for the duration, and purpose, of a single game or event. Examples of some of the rules that a game producer might have: * Engineer: Engineers have the ability to 'destroy' buildings, tanks, and special scenario targets. Typically this is done by using a faux satchel charge which the player throws and a supervising ref pulls the 'killed' players. * General: Most common of all scenario games; there is typically at least one General for each side of a scenario. The general commands the scenario teams on his side and dictates orders to anyone on his side. In games where rank is accounted for, a General is typically worth more points. * Officers: Besides the general, there are lower level officers like lieutenants and majors that are in the general's chain of command. * Medic: The medic 'heals' players on the field instead of the 'injured' player having to take the long walk back to the insertion point. * Sniper: A Sniper can point on an enemy player to the Ref, and the Ref will call that player out. * Tank crewperson: Operates the tank, or fires from it. A tank gunner is typically armed with an ordinary marker firing out of ports of the tank's cannon. * Tank hunter: Carries a nerf-rocket based 'Bazooka' that can destroy enemy tanks. * Mercenary: Mercenary players, typically a field's scenario team, can be 'bought' at certain events by a general to use for a short-time. Mercenaries are typically experienced tournament players that know the field better than most of the field's players. Hell Survivor's Monster Game is famous for its mercenaries.

It is a hybrid of two citrus cultivars ‚Äî 'King' (Citrus nobilis) √ó 'Willow Leaf' (Citrus √ó deliciosa) ‚Äî first developed by Howard B. Frost,Y. H. Hui, M. Pilar Cano, and Josef Barta (Editors) Handbook of Fruits and Fruit Processing. Wiley, John & Sons. 2006. ; page 312. at the University of California Citrus Experiment Station. After evaluation, the 'Kinnow' was released as a new citrus hybrid for commercial cultivation in 1935.  Description  Young Kinnow tree bearing fruit In a hot climate, plants can grow up to 35 feet high. 'Kinnow' trees are highly productive; it is not uncommon to find 1000 fruits per tree. The fruit matures in January or February. It peels easily and has a high juice content.  Seedless kinnow/ low seeded kinnow  The high seed content in this variety is a major hindrance in out-of-hand eating. Mikeal Roose of University of California, Riverside, USA developed low seeded 'Kinnow' and this variety was released under the name 'Kinnow LS' in the year 2011. H.S.Rattanpal of Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India developed low seeded 'Kinnow' through mutation breeding and recommended it under the name 'PAU Kinnow-1' in the year 2015. In Pakistan, a seedless 'Kinnow' has been developed (using selection method) by Niaz Ahmad Chaudhry '', a team member of National Agricultural Research Centre (NARC), Islamabad 'NARC' (former director of Citrus Research Institute, Sargodha,'CRI'.  Export from Asia  Most of the target export markets of Indian and Pakistani 'Kinnow' are those of developing countries. Only 2.6 percent of Kinnow exports target the markets of developed countries, which is due to the emerging demand for seedless Kinnow by the developed countries. About 61 percent of total world exports of oranges and mandarins are of seedless varieties. Some important export markets for 'Kinnow' are:Iran, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Netherlands, Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Russia and Vietnam.Marketing of Fruits Under WTO Regime, Dr. M. Sharif and Burhan Ahmad, Social Sciences Institute, NARC Islamabad Indonesia has also offered market access to Kinnow, from Pakistan at zero per cent. Over 40% of the Pakistani exports of Kinnows went to Russia in 2015. Internally, the prices of Kinnow in Pakistan dropped more than 50% between 2016 to 2020.  Harvesting and handling  Picking of Kinnow with clippers The 'Kinnow' fruit seeds are planted in the month of August-October. 'Kinnow' harvesting starts when the fruit's external colour becomes orange, from December to February. The best harvesting time is mid-January to mid-February, when the fruit attains a TSS/acid ratio of 12:1 to 14:1. The fruit quality declines in later pickings. Fruits are harvested by clipping the stem with the help of sharp clippers (secateurs). The stem is cut as short as possible to avoid mechanical injury to the fruit in packing and transits. As it is a comparatively loose rind fruit, harvesting by pulling fruits with one's hands is avoided. Coating 'Kinnow' fruits with commercial waxes can increase the shelf life up to 60 days. The fruit can be stored in cold storage at a temperature of 4-5 ¬∞C and a relative humidity of 85-90%. Packing of kinnows, Courtesy by SMHT Exports (Harvest Tradings) Kinnow products  Fruit processing  Food processing includes the selection of good-quality fruit. The ideal 'Kinnow' is firm to slightly soft, smooth-skinned with no deep grooves, and deep orange to almost red. Human hands can better judge and avoid product with soft spots, dull and faded coloring or rough and bumpy skin. Many processing technologies have been developed by state agricultural universities and other research institutes of India. Kinnow fruits can be stored at room temperature conditions or under cold storage conditions.

Because she was needed for the war effort, she was hastily finished with only two smokestacks and a superstructure only one deck high. Initially used for carrying cargo, in 1918 she was given accommodations for up to 3,000 troops. Her gross tonnage was listed at 24,547. The doomed liner Justicia was a near identical sister ship, both being built at the same yard. Conversion to luxury liner Originally ordered as the Bergenland for the Red Star Line but taken over during construction for use as a cargo vessel by the Shipping Controller and operated by the White Star Line who renamed her Belgic, the fourth ship to carry the name. In 1918 she was converted for use as a troopship able to carry 3000 troops. After the war she was employed returning US soldiers across the Atlantic until April 1921, when she was laid up at Liverpool. There were no berths available at any of the shipyards so that she could be rebuilt. Harland & Wolff finally had a free berth, and in March 1922 she was towed to Belfast, where work on her reconstruction began in earnest. She was allocated to the Red Star Line and renamed Belgenland. She was the second Red Star ship to be given this name. She was given a superstructure four decks in height and a third smokestack. Additionally she was converted to oil-firing. Her tonnage was increased to over 27,000 gross tons, making her Red Star‚Äôs largest and most luxurious ship. She remained on her route for a decade, and occasionally spent time on extensive world and winter cruises. On 4 December 1924 she embarked on a 133-day world cruise -- one of the longest attempted by a luxury liner at the time - advertised as \\"The Largest Ship to Circle the Globe\\". Albert Einstein on board Belgenland, 18 March 1933. One of her most famous passengers was Albert Einstein. Returning to Germany on board her in 1933, he found out Adolf Hitler had become Chancellor of Germany. Einstein left the ship at Antwerp and renounced his German citizenship. Later he booked a passage from Dover on another Red Star liner, the Westernland, and returned to the United States, vowing never to return to Germany.http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/einstein-renounces-german- citizenship-becomes-outlaw-in-nazi-germany Also in the 1920s, White Star line stewardess, Violet Jessop, famous for surviving the and sinkings, sailed on Belgenland on two round the world cruises while employed by Red Star. The Depression and demise The Depression hit the Belgenland hard. At first, she was reduced to sailing on short cruises and one day excursions from New York, charging $4 a passenger. Laid up in the winter of 1932-33, she made only three voyages the following summer, and they were Mediterranean cruises. The millionaires who took her lengthy and expensive cruises were now unable to do so. Then she made a few more cruises from London, and then she was laid up again in September at the Port of London. The Atlantic Transport Company purchased her in January 1935 and renamed her Columbia. She was then placed with their subsidiary, Panama Pacific Line and placed on their New York City -- California service via the Panama Canal. This venture failed and another attempt was made to place her on the New York ‚Äì West Indies route, stopping at Miami, Nassau, and Havana, but this too failed. She was too large for either service and was once again laid up, this time permanently. On 22 April 1936 she sailed from New York to the United Kingdom, was sold for scrap, and her scrapping commenced on 4 May of that year at Bo'ness Scotland.Frank C. Bowen The Shipbreaking Industry.

It is now a modern college for students aged between 16 and 18. Most students are taking what is known in the UK as Advanced-Levels (A-Levels) or, if in the first year; Advanced, Subsidiary Levels (AS-Levels). History =Grammar school= The college was founded as a Catholic Boys Grammar School by the Marist Fathers in 1925 and the former football ground of Blackburn Olympic F.C. was subsequently acquired by the Fathers as a site on which to build the school. It became St Mary's College RC Grammar School. =Sixth form college= The Finley-Stokes Centre was opened in March 2005. The opening ceremony was performed by the Right Rev. Bishop Thomas Burns, a former teacher at the school. The building was named in honour of former principal Michael Finley, who retired in 2008, and former deputy principal Peter Stokes, who died in 2004. A new science block was completed in August 2007, which was named 'The Graystone Science Centre'. The building was named after a former headmaster of the grammar school, Father Graystone. Following this the new performing arts complex was completed and was officially opened in February 2008, the centre has been named the 'O'Neill Academy of Performing Arts' in honour of former college principal, Rev. Kevin O'Neill. The new Arts Centre has state-of-the-art theatrical devices, including retractable seating in a multi-purpose room used for rehearsal and performances, as well as state-of-the-art lighting and sound technology. The building also includes several rehearsal and workshop spaces, a dance studio, as well as hosting a music room outfitted with the latest computer software, and a new recording studio.Official school website On 12 May Alastair Campbell opened St. Mary‚Äôs new, dedicated Enterprise Centre. This ¬£500,000 building was funded by the No Limits Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI) and supported by Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and Regenerate Pennine Lancashire. During the afternoon Campbell held a question and answer session with history and politics students of the College followed by a book signing session before the actual opening at 3:45 pm. In 2017, allegations of sexual abuse perpetrated by the late Kevin O'Neill led the governing body to remove from the performing arts centre all mentions of O'Neill's name. The body declared they were intending to change the name of the centre.

While most of the soldiers were from various parts of modern Bulgaria, among the buried are also 15 people from Vardar Macedonia (two of them from Novo Selo), three people from Greek Macedonia, two from the Western Outlands in modern Serbia and one each from Eastern Thrace in modern Turkey, from Kosovo and from Dobruja. One Serbian prisoner of war and later two Serbian gendarmes were also interred at the cemetery, which was used as an argument in 1966 by the local mayor to save the cemetery from planned destruction (as happened to most Bulgarian cemeteries in the Macedonian SR of Yugoslavia) by proclaiming it a Serbian one. Surrounded by a stone fence, the cemetery has identical crosses of valour over the graves, with the name of the interred, his rank, date of birth and death and native place also inscribed. A common memorial was erected in the central part, featuring a carved cross of valour and the inscription ‚Äû–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏–æ, –∑–∞ —Ç–µ–±–µ —Ç—£ —É–º—Ä—£—Ö–∞‚Äú (\\"O Bulgaria, for you they died\\", from national writer Ivan Vazov's The New Graveyard Above Slivnitsa 1885 poem). During the past years the initial cement crosses were shattered or damaged due to the weathering of the cement, while the central memorial was torn down by treasure hunters. However, in 2004 local citizens notified Bulgarian National Historical Museum director Bozhidar Dimitrov about the cemetery and its bad condition, who in his turn informed President of Bulgaria Georgi Parvanov. With the president's call to reconstruct the cemetery and with his political support, Bulgarian ambassador to the Republic of Macedonia Miho Mihov helped to observe all respective formalities to obtain a permission from the Macedonian authorities. Meanwhile, the Pliska Association produced exact marble copies of the original crosses. An official permission was received on 19 October 2006 and the reconstruction began, supported by locals and the Novo Selo municipal administration. On 4 November 2006, an Eastern Orthodox holiday of Archangel Michael, the renovated cemetery was officially inaugurated with a military and a religious ceremony paying tribute to the perished Bulgarian soldiers. The ceremony was attended by Georgi Parvanov, a number of officials and citizens of Bulgaria and Macedonia. The Novo Selo cemetery is the second reconstructed Bulgarian military cemetery in North Macedonia after the one in the village of Capari.

The second, third, four and fifth floors house the teaching assistants' offices and the practice rooms for instrumentalists, pianists and vocalists. The Elizabeth Wirth Music Building (EWMB) (previously the New Music Building) was built in 2005 thanks to a $20 million gift from McGill grad Seymour Schulich. The building has 8 floors above ground and two below ground. The bottom floor is known as -2 (minus 2) and is home to the Wirth Opera Studio (named after Manfred and Eliza Wirth), the Music Multimedia Room (MMR) as well as smaller recording studios. The first floor is home to a spacious lobby. On the first and the second floor are entrances to Tanna Schulich Hall, an intimate performance venue which seats 187 people. The third, fourth and fifth floor of the EWMB are home to the Marvin Duchow Music Library. The Gertrude Whitley Performance Library and the Music Student Computer Room, which was updated during the fall of 2008, can also be found on the fifth floor. The sixth floor is reserved for faculty office spaces. The seventh floor is the home of the Schulich School of Music administration and the 8th floor is home to CIRMMT. On April 30, 2015, the building was officially inaugurated as the Elizabeth Wirth Music Building, thanks to a donation of $7.5 million from McGill Alumna Elizabeth Wirth. Recitals and concerts are also frequently held at Redpath Hall on McGill University's main campus. The Schulich School of Music occupies 148,650 sq. ft. of space.

It is native to North America. Distribution Like all Sarracenia species, Sarracenia alata is native to the New World and grows in permanently wet and open wetlands typically classified as longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas. The Pale pitcher plant's habitat is split into two geographically separate areas: an eastern range from eastern Louisiana across southern Mississippi and into western Alabama and a western range from eastern Texas into western Louisiana. In Mississippi, stands of Sarracenia alata rival in size those of any other Sarracenia species. Description Among members of Sarracenia the floral coloring of Sarracenia alata is remarkably varied. Flowers may be cream to white, greenish, yellow or reddish. As the floral color variations exist within populations hundreds of miles from any other Sarracenia species, these variations cannot be attributed to hybridization.Sheridan, Philip M. \\"What is the identity of the west gulf coast pitcher plant, Sarracenia alata Wood?\\" Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 20 (1991): 102-110. PDF version Other than the range of floral colors, Sarracenia alata differs little from Sarracenia rubra. The veining of Sarracenia rubra pitchers tends to be more reticulated whereas that of Sarracenia alata often exhibits more of a pinstripe pattern and grows taller pitchers.

Built in the 19th century from the ruins of a Norman abbey, it was a residence of the Cochrane family and was later incorporated into the new Quarr Abbey monastery that was built on the site. History The house was built with stone from the ruins of a Norman abbey in the 19th century. It became the home of Sir Thomas John Cochrane in 1859.Certificate of terms and rents for Lease of Manor of Quarr, 1859 His daughter Minna was lady-in-waiting to Princess Beatrice, youngest daughter of Queen Victoria. It was at Quarr Abbey House that Princess Beatrice spent her honeymoon after her marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg on July 23, 1885 at St. Mildred's Church, Whippingham on the Isle of Wight. Henry died ten years later and was buried at St. Mildred's Church, part of which became known as the Battenberg Chapel. Queen Victoria visited Quarr Abbey House. The Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, and the German Kaiser William II watched the sailing boats from the balcony of the house during the annual Cowes Week Regatta. Only ten days before her death, Queen Victoria recorded in her diary she had enjoyed a duet at Quarr Abbey House played by Minna Cochrane and her daughter Beatrice. After the Queen's death at Osborne House, the Cochrane family and others ceased to frequent the island so often. Quarr Abbey House was left in the hands of a caretaker. On 24 May 1907 Quarr Abbey House was bought by Benedictine monks who had been leasing the Appuldurcombe House near Wroxall on the Isle of Wight.

Life and work  John William Dawson was born on 13 October 1820 in Pictou, Nova Scotia, where he attended and graduated from Pictou Academy. Of Scottish descent, Dawson attended the University of Edinburgh to complete his education, and graduated in 1842, having gained a knowledge of geology and natural history from Robert Jameson. Dawson returned to Nova Scotia in 1842, accompanying Sir Charles Lyell on his first visit to that territory. Dawson was subsequently appointed as Nova Scotia's first superintendent of education. Holding the post from 1850 to 1853, he was an energetic reformer of school design, teacher education and curriculum. Influenced by the American educator Henry Barnard, Dawson published a pamphlet titled, \\"School Architecture; abridged from Barnard's School Architecture\\" in 1850. One of the many schools built to his design, the Mount Hanley Schoolhouse still survives today, including the \\"Dawson Desks\\" named after him. Dawson's travels as school superintendent allowed him to deepen his geological studies, as he visited and studied geological sites across the region, leading to publication of his classic \\"Acadian Geology\\" (1855 and subsequent editions). He entered zealously into the geology of Canada, making a special study of the fossil forests of the coal-measures of Joggins, Nova Scotia, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. During the course of his second exploration of the cliffs with Charles Lyell in 1852, he discovered the remains of a tetrapod named Dendrerpeton entombed within a fossil tree. Over the years, he continued his exploration of the fossil trees, eventually unearthing the oldest known reptile in the history of life, which he named Hylonomus lyelli in honour of his mentor. From 1855 to 1893 he was professor of geology and principal of McGill University in Montreal, an institution which under his influence attained a high reputation. In 1859 he published a seminal paper describing the first fossil plant found in rocks of Devonian origin. Although his discovery did not have the impact that might have been expected at the time, he is now considered one of the founders of the science of palaeobotany. He later described the fossil plants of the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of Canada for the Geological Survey of Canada (1871‚Äì1873). He was elected FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society) in 1862. When the Royal Society of Canada was created he was the first to occupy the presidential chair, and he also acted as president of the British Association at its meeting at Birmingham in 1886, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882, (address of retiring AAAS president) and president of the Geological Society of America in 1893. Sir William Dawson's name is especially associated with Eozoon canadense, which in 1865 he described as an organism having the structure of a foraminifer. It was found in the Laurentian rocks, regarded as the oldest known geological system. His views on the subject were contested at the time, and have since been disproven, the so-called organism being now regarded as a mineral structure. He was appointed CMG in 1881, and was knighted in 1884. In 1882, while looking to fill the vacancy left at McGill by the death of botanist James Barnston, Dawson contacted Asa Gray of Harvard University for recommendations. Gray suggested his former assistant David P. Penhallow, who Dawson accepted as a lecturer. He died in Montreal, 19 November 1899, and was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery. Lady Dawson served as President of the Ladies' Bible Association. Lady Dawson cofounded the Ladies' Educational Institute of Montreal with Mrs. John Molson and others. Lord and Lady Dawson had several sons. The eldest, George Mercer Dawson, served as Director of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1895. He is interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal, Quebec, and is the namesake for Dawson College. The mineral dawsonite, which was discovered during the building of the Redpath Museum with which he was intimately related, is named in his honour. Creationism As a Christian, Dawson spoke against Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and came to write The Origin of the World, According to Revelation and Science (1877) and Facts and Fancies in Modern Science: Studies of the Relations of Science to Prevalent Speculations and Religious Belief (1882) where he discussed how science and religion (particularly Christian Revelation) were complementary in his view. In his books on geological subjects he maintained a distinctly theological attitude, refusing the theory of human evolution from brute ancestors, and holding that the human species only made its appearance on this earth within quite recent times. Like Arnold Henry Guyot, Hugh Miller, and James Dwight Dana, he defended day-age creationism. Dawson wrote many religious articles. He attacked evolution in the last two chapters of his book, The Story of the Earth and Man. Publications Besides many memoirs in the Transactions of learned societies, he published several books:  Also  * * Also  * * (published posthumously) Family Lady Margaret Dawson by William Notman John William Dawson married Margaret A.

It was the first facility in the world to treat shock. Shock Trauma was founded by R Adams Cowley, considered the father and major innovator of trauma medicine. Early years While serving in the United States Army in France immediately following World War II, Cowley observed that many severe traumatic injuries could be stabilized if the patient could be transported to a military hospital where a surgeon was present within one hour of the initial injury. Cowley coined the term \\"golden hour\\" to describe this crucial period of time. Cowley thus lobbied the legislature in Maryland to purchase helicopters for the transport of trauma patients to expedite their arrival to these higher-care facilities. The Maryland legislature initially denied his request, due to the cost of helicopters, but he was subsequently able to persuade the State of Maryland to purchase helicopters by agreeing to the premise they be shared with the Maryland State Police. Today, almost all major trauma centers in the United States utilize helicopters to transport trauma patients to the hospital. During the establishment of trauma centers in the early 1970s, Cowley fought with the medical community to change the prevailing policy of first responders taking all patients, including traumas, to the \\"nearest hospital first.\\" According to Cowley, the major flaw to this system was that the nearest hospital was most likely not capable of treating severe trauma. In 1975, Dutch Ruppersberger, a young prosecutor (and current Congressperson) was involved in a nearly fatal automobile accident and had his life saved largely in part to being transported directly to University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center. When Ruppersberger asked Cowley what he could do to repay him for saving his life, Cowley responded, \\"Run for office so you can help us get the resources we need to continue saving lives.‚Äù Ruppersberger successfully ran for numerous local, state, and federal elective offices all the while advocating for shock trauma. The policy of \\"nearest hospital first\\" was eventually abandoned, and emergency medical systems across the United States now follow the model first advocated by Cowley. Facilities Shock Trauma houses over 100 inpatient beds dedicated to emergency surgery, resuscitation, intensive care, and acute surgical care. The facility boasts a dedicated resuscitation area in excess of 13 beds. The Trauma Resuscitation Unit (TRU) is located on the building's second floor. Helicopters and ambulances bring injured patients directly to the TRU for emergency treatment and stabilization. Specialized trauma teams composed of trauma surgeons and emergency medicine physicians triage and treat patients as they arrive by helicopter and ambulance. Teams of consultants are available 24/7 and include orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, vascular surgeons, plastic and reconstructive surgeons, radiologists, anesthesiologists, and others. Shock Trauma is an academic institution and emergency-medicine residents, trauma fellows, and surgical residents are involved in all aspects of patient care and evaluation. A large team of trauma physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and technicians complete the trauma team personnel and stand ready to receive victims 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. The helipad at Shock Trauma can accommodate up to four medevac helicopters at one time and has direct elevator access to the resuscitation area several stories below. Adjacent to the TRU is a vast array of equipment and facilities that are immediately available to the patient in extremis. Shock Trauma has nine dedicated operating suites, its own unique trauma post-anesthesia care unit, in addition to two dedicated multislice CT scanners, an angiography suite, and digital plain film capability. The inpatient wards of the Shock Trauma center consist of specialized intensive- care units, intermediate-care units, and regular surgical-floor beds. Shock Trauma can admit patients directly into the operating room if their condition requires it. Intensive care at Shock Trauma is a multidisciplinary endeavor: the facility boasts dedicated units for victims of multi-system and neurosurgical trauma. In 2013, Shock Trauma Center completed and opened a major expansion to the facility. Renovating around 68 patient rooms to conform with modern day standards. Education Shock Trauma trains physicians and medical personnel from locations overseas and throughout the United States. In addition to training residents at the University of Maryland itself, the facility hosts emergency-medicine and surgery residents from all over the United States and Canada. Shock Trauma receives over 7500 admissions per year and provides its residents with intensive training in the evaluation and management of both blunt and penetrating injury. In May 2007, Thomas M. Scalea, physician-in-chief for the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, presented a case at the University of Maryland Medical School's annual historical clinicopathological conference in Baltimore on the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and whether the world's first center for trauma victims could have improved the outcome had Lincoln's assassination occurred today. \\"This could be a recoverable injury, with a reasonable expectation he would survive,\\" Scalea said, noting that the assassin's weapon was relatively impotent compared to the firepower now on the streets today. Shock Trauma's educational mission extends beyond the training of future physicians. The facility hosts members of the United States Armed Forces, in addition to providing education for local emergency-medical service providers. Movie In 1982, a television movie was produced by Telecom Entertainment and Glen Warren Productions about Cowley, his discovery of \\"The Golden Hour\\" and his crusade to establish the first fully dedicated trauma center in the world. The movie starred William Conrad (of Cannon fame) as Cowley. It was syndicated on TV stations all across the United States on October 27, 1982. Television The television docudrama series Shock Trauma: Edge of Life, which aired on Discovery Life was filmed at R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center.

Though born in Prince Edward island, he is considered a Scots-Quebecer. Early life and career Born William Christopher McDonald in 1831 at Tracadie, in what was then the British Colony of Prince Edward Island, he was sixth of seven children of The Hon. Donald Macdonald (1795-1854) and Anna Matilda (1797-1877), daughter of The Hon. Ralph Brecken. In 1772, as a consequence of the Jacobite Rebellion, Macdonald's paternal grandfather, John MacDonald of Glenaladale, the 8th laird of Glenaladale (of the MacDonalds of Clan Ranald), purchased more than of land in Prince Edward Island for settlement by more than 200 members of his Roman Catholic clan. Known today as the Glenaladale Settlers, in Canada the family name had been recorded as McDonald, which he maintained until 1898, when he began using the historical Scottish spelling but without capitalizing the \\"d\\". As a youth, Macdonald rebelled against the authoritarian rule of his father and his Roman Catholic upbringing. Although his mother was Protestant, Macdonald and his siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith. At the age of sixteen he renounced the church, choosing to become a non-practising Christian. At eighteen he left his Island home, making his way to the United States, where he found clerical work in Boston. Although he had limited education, Macdonald quickly showed an entrepreneurial spirit and, joined by his brother Augustine, he organized himself as a broker to handle the shipping of American-made goods to merchants in his native Prince Edward Island. However, after a ship carrying some of his merchandise sank in an ocean storm, the venture had severe problems and Macdonald closed the business and left Boston. Tobacco enterprise and the American Civil War The Macdonald brothers moved to the then Province of Canada where they settled in Montreal, a city that was then undergoing an economic boom. There, they made a living as brokers, earning commissions from the resale of a variety of products until 1858 when they opened McDonald Brothers and Co., a company that made tobacco products. The business procured tobacco leaf from suppliers in the southern United States that was converted to pipe and chewing tobacco at their small Montreal facility. While the use of tobacco products was growing in popularity, the American Civil War afforded the fledgling company an opportunity that brought enormous financial success, leading to Macdonald Brothers becoming the preeminent company in the field in Canada. Virtually all of the tobacco growers were located in states that were part of the Confederacy and with the onset of the war, the northern states faced a huge shortage of tobacco leaf. Because Macdonald's company was in Canada, he was able to buy the leaf from the South and have it brought by ocean cargo vessels to Montreal. There, it was processed then the finished product was shipped to the tobacco-starved market in the northern United States. Despite the fortune that Macdonalds' tobacco made, Macdonald himself often said that he was ashamed of his business, seeing smoking as a \\"filthy and disgusting habit and even forbade its consumption in his presence\\", and referring to his shame as a source of his philanthropy. That was also perhaps why his company's slogan was \\"Tobacco with a heart\\". Postbellum career and philanthropic activities At the end of the Civil War, the company continued to prosper and by the early 1870s, it had more than five hundred employees. During this period, Macdonald bought out his brother's stock position and soon began using the great wealth he had earned to undertake philanthropic endeavors. Macdonald's philanthropic efforts at McGill University began because of his close relationship with John William Dawson, the principal of the university at the time. Macdonald, never having had a family of his own, soon became extremely fond of the whole Dawson family. In fact, he would later build the Macdonald-Harrington building (currently houses the Department of Architecture) in honor of Dawson's daughter Anna marrying the university geologist and future head of the chemistry department, Bernard J. Harrington. In 1870, he provided the funding for ten scholarships to McGill University, a program that continues to this day. However, this marked only a small beginning of the massive funding he would bestow on the university where he would serve on the Board of Governors for more than thirty years. His generosity paid for the cost to construct buildings at McGill University to house new chemistry and physics departments, and, jointly with fellow Montrealer Thomas Workman, the engineering building. In each of these cases, for a time, Macdonald even bore the faculty costs for the new departments as government funding was limited. When the university's engineering building burned down, Macdonald paid the costs to rebuild it. That building was named in his honor. As a result of these expanded facilities, the university began to establish an international reputation that would attract the likes of Ernest Rutherford to teach and where he did the work which earned him the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. When real estate developers purchased the property at the southwest corner of the University campus to build a hotel, Macdonald stepped in and bought the property at a premium then gave it to the university. However, to ensure McGill was not subjected to other unwanted commercial development that would limit the university's future growth, he purchased and donated 25 acres (100,000 m¬≤) north of the main campus which became the site for Molson Stadium, the gymnasium, and Douglas Hall. Macdonald's love of nature and rural life led to his establishing a new type of specialized school in cooperation with Dr. James W. Robertson, the then Commissioner of Agriculture and Dairying for the Government of Canada. Built in Quebec, the Maritime Provinces and Ontario, and aimed at those wanting to make their living in rural agriculture environments, these school's curriculum included manual training programmes, domestic sciences, and horticulture. Concurrently, Macdonald established a training fund for agricultural teachers but this first interest in agricultural studies soon led to the creation of his most important legacy. From fellow Montreal businessman Robert Reford, in 1904 Macdonald purchased three farm properties in an area on the western end of Montreal Island known as Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. On the 300 acres (1.2 km¬≤), he planned and built Macdonald College, an agriculture training institute. Constructed in 1905-06 and opened in the fall of 1907, the large multi-building facility's entire construction and furnishing costs were funded entirely by Macdonald who also provided a $2 million operating endowment. In his will, he left the College a further $1 million for the operating fund. It is now part of McGill University and houses its Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, and the McGill School of Environment. Macdonald was one of the major stockholders in the Bank of Montreal and served on its boards of directors. Beyond his philanthropic gifts for education purposes, he also donated substantial funds to the Montreal General Hospital. Just as rural life was important to him, so was the city and he served as a volunteer director of the Montreal Parks and Playgrounds Association. Named President and Chancellor of McGill University in early 1914, Macdonald also provided funding to create McGill University College of British Columbia which ultimately became the University of British Columbia. Legacy Macdonald died in 1917 and was interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. A proponent of bilingualism, his will established travelling fellowships for the McGill University Faculty of Law that paid the costs for English-speaking Quebec lawyers to study the French language and the history of the French Civil Code in France. The money Macdonald donated to philanthropic causes was unparalleled in the history of Canada yet despite his wealth and good works, he remained a humble man who avoided publicity. He was deeply proud of his Scottish heritage, and the image of a Scottish lass has adorned the packaging of Macdonald tobacco products for nearly a century. However, Macdonald personally disliked tobacco and admitted to feeling ashamed that he made a living from such a business. Five years after his death, his company expanded its facilities to the mass production of cigarettes. A lifelong bachelor, Macdonald bequeathed his tobacco company to Walter and Howard Stewart, the two sons of company manager David Stewart. The company remained in the Stewart family until 1973 when David M. Stewart (1920‚Äì1984) sold it to the American tobacco giant R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and used the proceeds to establish the Macdonald Stewart Foundation for charitable causes.

Distribution Like all the Sarracenia, it is native to North America. The species is endemic to the Southeastern United States. USDA Distribution map for Sarracenia leucophylla It inhabits moist and low-nutrient longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas, primarily along the United States Gulf Coast, and generally west of the Apalachicola River on the Florida Panhandle. It is also found in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina. In North Carolina it has apparently been introduced by humans to areas outside its native range. Weakley, Alan S.

Each leaf is colored at top with reddish-purple veins on a white background and topped by an erect, roundish, wavy-edged hood.Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Native Plant Information Network‚àíNPIN: Sarracenia leucophylla (Crimson pitcherplant) It is highly variable with respect to its height, with plants in some localities reaching almost in height, while in others, plants can be diminutive. A seldom seen tall dwarf form is endemic to Garcon Point in Santa Rosa County, Florida. Conservation The plant is a listed vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Sarracenia leucophylla The greatest threat to S. leucophylla, as is the case with most Sarracenia species, is loss of its unique wetland habitat to development along the Gulf Coast, as well as forest succession that was historically kept in check by natural wildfires. It is also endangered from being one of the largest and showiest Sarracenia species, and is vulnerable to poachers of living plants and to the cut-floral trade for use in flower arrangements. Cultivation Sarracenia leucophylla is cultivated as an ornamental plant.D‚ÄôAmato, Peter. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley. Despite its native range in the Southeastern U.S., it is remarkably hardy and can be grown outside even in USDA zones 6 and colder with careful winter protection. In cultivation it is generally less tolerant of stagnant water conditions and requires adequate soil drainage while still retaining requisite moisture levels to prevent root rot.International Carnivorous Plant Society: Growing Sarracenia Leucophylla Several clones are recognized: *'Schnell's Ghost', a yellow-flowered clone with little red in the pitchers (though not anthocyanin free) *'Hurricane Creek White', a group of predominantly white plants from Hurricane Creek, AL *'Tarnok', a mutant form which produces a showy, although sterile, double flower *'Titan', an especially tall and robust form that may produce fall pitchers greater than 38 inches (97 cm) in height.

Pierre Dupuy (27 November 1582 ‚Äì 14 December 1651), otherwise known as Puteanus, was a French scholar, the son of the humanist and bibliophile Claude Dupuy. Biography He was born in Agen, Aquitaine (now in Lot-et-Garonne, France). In 1615 he was commissioned by Mathieu Mol√©, first president of the parlement of Paris, to draw up an inventory of the documents which constituted what at that time was known as the Tr√©sor des chartes. This work occupied eleven years. His manuscript inventory is preserved in the original and in copy in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, and transcriptions are in the national archives in Paris, at the record office in London, and elsewhere. Dupuy's classification is still regarded with respect, but the inventory has been partially replaced by the publication of the Layettes du tr√©sor (four volumes, coming down to 1270; 1863-1902). Dupuy also published, with his brother Jacques, and their friend Nicolas Rigault, the History of Aug. de Thou (1620, 1626). The two brothers then bought from Rigault the post of keeper of the king's library, and drew up a catalogue of the library (Nos. 9352-9354 and 10366-10367 of the Latin collection in the Biblioth√®que Nationale). In the course of this work, Dupuy became acquainted with and copied an enormous mass of unpublished documents, which furnished him with the material for some excellent works: *Trait√© des droits et des libert√©s de l'√âglise gallicane, avec les preuves (1639) *Histoire de l'ordre militaire des Templiers (1654) *Histoire g√©n√©rale du schisme qui a √©t√© dans l'√âglise depuis 1378 jusqu'√† 1428 (1654) *Histoire du diff√©rend entre le page Boniface VIII et le roi Philippe le Bel (1655) These works, especially the last, are important contributions to the history of the relations of church and state in the Middle Ages. They were written from the Gallican standpoint, i.e. in favour of the rights of the crown in temporal and political matters, and this explains the delay in their publication until after Dupuy's death. He wrote also Trait√© des r√©gences et des majorit√©s des rois de France (1655) and Recueil des droits du roi (1658). Dupuy's papers, preserved in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, were inventoried by L√©on Dorez (Catalogue de la collection Dupuy, 1899).

It is situated directly to the east of the McGill University campus in the borough of Plateau-Mont-Royal. It is named after the neighbourhood's two main streets, Milton Street and Park Avenue. Many McGill students live in this area, which is characterized by a mix of rowhouses and low- to mid-rise apartment buildings. The area is roughly bordered by University Street and the university campus to the west, Sherbrooke Street to the south, Pine Avenue to the north, and Park Avenue and the Lower Plateau neighborhood to the east, though McGill University considers this area to extend as far east as Saint Laurent Boulevard or just short of Saint-Louis Square. The neighbourhood has many historic townhouses built in the late 19th century, which housed affluent businessmen and their families. The area remained a wealthy enclave throughout the early half of the 20th century. Eventually, many of the affluent residents of the area moved to other boroughs such as Westmount or to the suburbs. While the space is colloquially known as the \\"Ghetto\\", the name for the area is used with the original definition of the word \\"ghetto\\": a socioeconomically homogeneous area. There is a movement against this nomenclature because it suggests that the area is completely inhabited by students, while in reality it is a historically significant district that is home to many families, working professionals and long-term residents.

Development and preservation Marlborough Apartments In the 1970s, community activists were concerned that the vast La Cit√© mixed-use complex (consisting of apartments, offices, a mall, and a hotel - now McGill's New Residence) would destroy the neighbourhood's character. A campaign to stop further redevelopment was led by a residents' coalition and the then-newly formed historic preservation group Heritage Montreal. When McGill University acquired the hotel component of La Cit√© (at Park and Prince Arthur) and transformed it into an undergraduate student residence (called New Residence Hall), the student population in Milton Park increased by 650 people.

Early beginnings The Abington Art Center was started in 1965 as the Old York Road Art Guild, by a group of women who believed in the \\"benefit of cultural enrichment for individual and community life to be derived from creative artistic expression\\", the guild's educational elements were brought under a separate non-profit entity called Abington Art Center. On Christmas Day 1969, a rare book and print collector, Lessing J. Rosenwald and his wife Edith, donated their estate, Alverthorpe Manor, to the Abington community for the purpose of allowing residents to gather for cultural and recreational purposes. Shortly afterwards, the organization appointed its first paid director and the guild formally ended. Development In 1981, the center expanded into the old gallery wing of Alverthorpe Manor when the Rosenwald Collection was moved to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. This doubled the instruction space as well as the center's student capacity. A sculpture garden was opened in 1990. In 1996, the art center expanded within the building and initiated a 5-year renovation project designed to transform Alverthorpe Manor from a private residence to a public place. Currently, the center contains a gallery, six studios, classrooms, and a sculpture park, and stages outdoor events throughout the year. Art exhibitions and community outreach The of lawn and woodlands that make up the Sculpture Park has included works by Joy Episalla, Robert Lawrance Lobe, Jeanne Jaffe, Thomas Matsuda, Brian McCutcheon, Steven Siegel, Steve Tobin, Ursula von Rydingsvard, Jay Walker, and Winifred Lutz. In 2003, Abington Art Center devised a plan for the purposes of developing Alverthorpe Manor property into a 27-acre \\"cultural campus\\" within a suburban community. The plan was developed by Wallace Roberts & Todd. Leora Brecher, a sculptor who taught ceramics at the center for 18 years, said, \\"It's different here compared to other art centers I've seen. As well as a studio school, it has the sculpture garden and outreach to the community. Other places are more about teaching than the public.\\" The center has hosted the annual \\"Touch the Future\\" juried art show, featuring the work of young artists from the area. In 2005, the center received a $500,000 pledge of a matching grant from the state of Pennsylvania, with the objective of assisting the economic development goals of the surrounding municipalities. The first phase of development was completed in 2011. Finances Abington Art Center is a small nonprofit organization with an estimated budget of less than $1 million. Its income comes from classes, workshops, and facility rentals for weddings and other affairs (38 percent); foundations (24 percent); membership dues (11 percent); corporate and government support (9 percent); and gift shop sales, fund-raisers and other sources (18 percent).

It takes its theme from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew describing the moment when Christ called the two brothers Simon ‚Äì later known as Peter ‚Äì and Andrew, to be his disciples: > As Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is > called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea ‚Äì for they > were fishermen. And he said to them, \\"Follow me, and I will make you fishers > of men.\\" Immediately, they left their nets and followed him. Matthew 4:18‚Äì20 The painting shows a young, beardless Christ, leading the two much older- looking brothers. The more prominent of the brothers, presumably Simon, is holding a fish in his right hand. The edge of the canvas is rather damaged, but the central panel is in good condition. The presence of \\"incisions\\" into the ground of the canvas marking out St. Peter's ear and the eyes of Christ are typical of Caravaggio's technique.C. Whitfield, Caravaggio, exh. cat., New York, 2007, p. 25 () The painting appears to date from the height of Caravaggio's Roman period, c. 1603‚Äì06. The work was purchased by Charles I, an avid art collector, in 1637. Sold during the Commonwealth, it was re-acquired by Charles II after the Restoration. It has since remained in royal possession, and is today owned by Queen Elizabeth II. Kept in Hampton Court Palace, it was long believed to be a virtually worthless copy of a lost original, but after six years of restoration and examination the Royal Collection declared on 10 November 2006, that this was, in fact, an authentic Caravaggio. The verdict has been corroborated by external experts, and the painting is now probably worth more than ¬£50 million. The Queen, however, may not sell paintings from the Royal Collection as she holds the collection in trust for the nation. After a 6-year cleaning project, it went on display as part of a small exhibition of Caravaggio paintings at the Termini Art Gallery in Rome's Termini Station from 22 November to 31 January 2006. It then moved to an exhibition (from March 2007) of Italian Baroque and Renaissance art at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace. In 2015 it was put on display in the Cumberland Gallery in Hampton Court Palace.

Universit√© de Montr√©al Accessed 20 October 2008. (UdeM; ; translates to University of Montreal) is a French- language public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The university's main campus is located on the northern slope of Mount Royal in the neighbourhoods of Outremont and C√¥te-des-Neiges. The institution comprises thirteen faculties, more than sixty departments and twoGeneral overview of Universit√© de Montr√©al affiliated schools: the Polytechnique Montr√©al (School of Engineering; formerly the √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al) and HEC Montr√©al (School of Business). It offers more than 650 undergraduate programmes and graduate programmes, including 71 doctoral programmes. The university was founded as a satellite campus of the Universit√© Laval in 1878. It became an independent institution after it was issued a papal charter in 1919 and a provincial charter in 1920. Universit√© de Montr√©al moved from Montreal's Quartier Latin to its present location at Mount Royal in 1942. It was made a secular institution with the passing of another provincial charter in 1967. The school is co-educational, and has 34,335 undergraduate and 11,925 post- graduate students (excluding affiliated schools). Alumni and former students reside across Canada and around the world, with notable alumni serving as government officials, academics, and business leaders. History The Universit√© de Montr√©al was founded in 1878 as a new branch of Universit√© Laval in Quebec City. It was then known as the Universit√© Laval √† Montr√©al. The move initially went against the wishes of Montr√©al's prelate, who advocated an independent university in his city.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) Certain parts of the institution's educational facilities, such as those of the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec and the Faculty of Medicine (founded as the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery), had already been established in Montr√©al in 1876 and 1843, respectively.The Canadian Encyclopedia ‚Äì University The Vatican granted the university some administrative autonomy in 1889, thus allowing it to choose its own professors and license its own diplomas. However, it was not until 8 May 1919 that a papal charter from Pope Benedict XV granted full autonomy to the university.The Canadian Encyclopedia ‚Äì Universit√© de Montr√©al It thus became an independent Catholic university and adopted Universit√© de Montr√©al as its name.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) Universit√© de Montr√©al was granted its first provincial charter on 14 February 1920. At the time of its creation, fewer than a hundred students were admitted to the university's three faculties, which at that time were located in Old Montreal. These were the Faculty of Theology (located at the Grand s√©minaire de Montr√©al), the Faculty of Law (hosted by the Society of Saint-Sulpice), and the Faculty of Medicine (at the Ch√¢teau Ramezay).Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì English ‚Äì Brief HistoryUniversit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì Information g√©n√©rale Graduate training based on German-inspired American models of specialized coursework and completion of a research thesis was introduced and adopted. Most of Qu√©bec's secondary education establishments employed classic course methods of varying quality. This forced the university to open a preparatory school in 1887 to harmonize the education level of its students. Named the \\"Faculty of Arts\\", this school would remain in use until 1972 and was the predecessor of Qu√©bec's current CEGEP system.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) The former main building of the university from 1895 to 1942. The building is located in Montreal's Quartier Latin. Two distinct schools eventually became affiliated to the university. The first was the √âcole Polytechnique, a school of engineering, which was founded in 1873 and became affiliated in 1887. The second was the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes Commerciales, or HEC (a business school), which was founded in 1907 and became part of the university in 1915. In 1907, Universit√© de Montr√©al opened the first francophone school of architecture in Canada at the √âcole Polytechnique.The Canadian Encyclopedia ‚Äì Architectural Education Between 1920 and 1925, seven new faculties were added: Philosophy, Literature, Sciences, Veterinary Medicine, Dental Surgery, Pharmacy, and Social Sciences. Notably, the Faculty of Social Sciences was founded in 1920 by √âdouard Montpetit, the first laic to lead a faculty.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) He thereafter was named secretary-general, a role he fulfilled until 1950. From 1876 to 1895, most classes took place in the Grand s√©minaire de Montr√©al. From 1895 to 1942, the school was housed in a building at the intersection of Saint-Denis and Sainte-Catherine streets in Montreal's eastern downtown Quartier Latin. Unlike English-language universities in Montr√©al, such as McGill University, Universit√© de Montr√©al suffered a lack of funding for two major reasons: the relative poverty of the French Canadian population and the complications ensuing from its being managed remotely, from Quebec City. The downtown campus was hit by three different fires between 1919 and 1921, further complicating the university's already precarious finances and forcing it to spend much of its resources on repairing its own infrastructure.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) By 1930, enough funds had been accumulated to start the construction of a new campus on the northwest slope of Mount Royal, adopting new plans designed by Ernest Cormier. However, the financial crisis of the 1930s virtually suspended all ongoing construction.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) Many speculated that the university would have to sell off its unfinished building projects to ensure its own survival. Not until 1939 did the provincial government directly intervene by injecting public funds.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) Construction of Pavilion Roger-Gaudry in 1941. The Mount Royal campus was inaugurated in 1943. The campus's construction subsequently resumed and the mountain campus was officially inaugurated on 3 June 1943.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) The Cote-des-Neiges site includes property expropriated from a residential development along Decelles Avenue, known as Northmount Heights. The university's former downtown facilities would later serve as Montreal's second francophone university, the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM). In 1943, the university assisted the Western Allies by providing laboratory accommodations on its campus. Scientists there worked to develop a nuclear reactor, notably by conducting various heavy water experiments. The research was part of the larger Manhattan Project, which aimed to develop the first atomic bomb. Scientists working on the school's campus eventually produced the first atomic battery to work outside of the United States. One of the participating Qu√©bec scientists, Pierre Demers, also discovered a series of radioactive elements issued from Neptunium.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì F√™tes du 125e ‚Äì 125 ans d'histoire (1878‚Äì2003) Universit√© de Montr√©al was issued its second provincial charter in 1950. A new government policy of higher education during the 1960s (following the Quiet Revolution) came in response to popular pressure and the belief that higher education was key to social justice and economic productivity. The policy led to the school's third provincial charter, which was passed in 1967. It defined the Universit√© de Montr√©al as a public institution, dedicated to higher learning and research, with students and teachers having the right to participate in the school's administration. In 1965, the appointment of the university's first secular rector, Roger Gaudry, paved the way for modernization. The school established its first adult-education degree program offered by a French Canadian university in 1968. That year the Lionel-Groulx and 3200 Jean-Brillant buildings were inaugurated, the former being named after Quebec nationalist Lionel Groulx. The following year, the Louis Collin parking garage‚Äîwhich won a Governor General's medal for its architecture in 1970‚Äîwas erected. An important event that marked the university's history was the √âcole Polytechnique massacre. On 6 December 1989, a gunman armed with a rifle entered the √âcole Polytechnique building, killing 14 people, all of whom were women, before taking his own life. Since 2002, the university has embarked on its largest construction project since the late 1960s, with the construction of five new buildings planned for advanced research in pharmacology, engineering, aerospace, cancer studies and biotechnology. Campus Map of the university's Mount Royal campus The university's main campus is located on the northern slope of Mount Royal in the Outremont and C√¥te-des-Neiges boroughs. Its landmark Pavilion Roger-Gaudry (named for former rector Roger Gaudry)‚Äîknown until 2003 as Pavillon principal‚Äîcan be seen from around the campus and is known for its imposing tower. It is built mainly in the Art Deco style with some elements of International style and was designed by noted architect Ernest Cormier. On 14 September 1954, a Roll of Honour plaque on the wall at the right of the stairs to the Court of Honour in Roger-Gaudry Pavillon was dedicated to alumni of the school who died in while in the Canadian military during the Second World War.http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr- eng.asp?PID=7904 Alumni ‚Äì World War II Honour Roll On November 1963, a memorial plaque was dedicated to the memory of those members of the Universit√© de Montr√©al who served in the Armed Forces during the First and Second World Wars and Korea.http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr- eng.asp?PID=7905 Alumni ‚Äì war service The Mont-Royal campus is served by the C√¥te-des-Neiges, Universit√©-de-Montr√©al, and √âdouard-Montpetit metro stations. The J.-Armand-Bombardier Incubator is among buildings jointly erected by the Universit√© de Montr√©al and Polytechnique Montr√©al. The incubator is part on the main Campus of Universit√© de Montr√©al and was built in the fall of 2004 with the aim of helping R&D-intensive; startup companies by providing complete infrastructures at advantageous conditions. The environment helps promote collaboration between industries and academics while encouraging Quebec entrepreneurship. Since its creation the Incubator has hosted more than fifteen companies, mainly in the biomedical field, in the field of polymer/surface treatment, in optics/photonics (like Photon etc.) and in IT security (like ESET). The Centre hospitalier de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al (CHUM) and the Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine are the two teaching hospital networks of the Universit√© de Montr√©al's Faculty of Medicine, although the latter is also affiliated with other medical institutions such as the Institut universitaire de g√©riatrie de Montr√©al, Montreal Heart Institute, H√¥pital Sacr√©-Coeur and H√¥pital Maisonneuve- Rosemont. A plaque dedicated to the personnel of the \\"H√¥pital G√©n√©ral Canadien No. 6 (Universit√© Laval de Montr√©al)\\" from 1916 to 1920 was donated by Mr. Louis de Gonzague Beaubien in 1939. = Off-campus facilities = Apart from its main Mont-Royal campus, the university also maintains five regional facilities in Terrebonne, Laval, Longueuil, Saint-Hyacinthe and Mauricie.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì Plan Campus The campus in Laval, just north of Montr√©al, was opened in 2006. It is Laval's first university campus and is located in the area near the Montmorency metro station and opposite to Coll√®ge Montmorency. In October 2009, the university announced an expansion of its Laval satellite campus with the commissioning of the six-storey Cit√© du Savoir complex. The Mauricie campus in the city of Trois-Rivi√®res is known for its association with the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res (UQTR) and as a satellite campus for the university's faculty of medicine. To solve the problem of lack of space on its main campus, the university is also planning to open a new campus in Outremont, known as the MIL campus.Universit√© de Montr√©al ‚Äì Outremont facility project page Campus MIL The science building at Campus MIL, while it is still under construction in April 2019 The University of Montreal's master plan includes the construction of new institutional spaces in the borough of Outremont, Montreal. The campus accessible by two metro stations (Outremont and Acadie), will include teaching and research rooms. The premises are built in accordance with LEED eco- certification. The MIL campus (which derives its name from \\"Milieu\\", which means middle in French) has been under construction since 2016. At the centre of the campus lies the Science Complex, which opened in 2019. The opening of the MIL Campus generated controversy and attracted criticism from various community organizations in Parc-Extension, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Montreal. In the fall of 2019, the opening of the campus was disrupted by the Parc-Extension Action Committee (CAPE) to denounce the increasing number of tenants who are evicted from their apartments to make more units available for students in the neighborhood. More recently, these organizations claimed that the arrival of the campus has encouraged a significant increase in evictions and rental prices in Parc-Extension. Researchers from three Montreal universities ‚Äì McGill University, Concordia University and the University of Quebec in Montreal ‚Äì implemented the Parc-Extension anti-eviction mapping project in 2019, in collaboration with CAPE. A report documenting the gentrification of Parc-Extension was published in June 2020 by the Parc- Extension anti-eviction mapping project and the CAPE. The authors conclude that the average rent for two-bedroom apartment ads between February and May 2020 was almost twice the estimates made by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation in October 2019. Organizations have also criticized the Universit√© de Montr√©al for excluding the construction of student residences from the master plan of the new campus. Academics The Universit√© de Montr√©al is a publicly funded research university and a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada.

Early and personal life He was born in Wangford, Suffolk, England. He studied medicine at Cambridge University and eventually became a doctor. His first writing credit (as Sam Hutt) was on a Sarah Miles 1965 single \\"Where Am I\\". His first recording was credited as Boeing Duveen & The Beautiful Soup with \\"Jabberwock\\"/\\"Which Dreamed It\\" issued on UK Parlophone R 5696 in May 1968. He is co-credited as the writer as \\"Sam Hutt\\" on both sides together with Lewis Carroll, the songs are adapted. Hutt's family background is radical: his father Allen (a journalist and expert on the history of printing) was a lifelong Communist. During the NUM miners strike in 1984/85, the Hank Wangford Band toured extensively with Billy Bragg and the Frank Chickens as \\"Hank, Frank and Billy\\" performing at trade-union benefit and anti-racist gigs. It was during such a benefit for the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1984 that Hank and the band were attacked on stage by a group of right-wing skinheads, an event that has been immortalised in the song \\"On The Line\\". The Hank Wangford Band A chance meeting with former Byrds member Gram Parsons, who played him the song \\"You're Still on My Mind\\" (from the album Sweetheart of the Rodeo), led him to country music. The 1984 Edinburgh Festival Fringe saw the Hank Wangford Band achieve some acclaim, with their show being nominated for the Perrier Award. Fringe Sunday also saw the importation to Edinburgh of the sport of cow-pat flinging. Unfortunately, this required hard cow-pats as an essential part of the process. BBC Radio 1 DJ Andy Kershaw had to put out an appeal for cow-pats which later had to be dried in a microwave oven for them to work successfully. Hank's setlist No Hall Too Small Wangford has also toured with Reg Meuross and latterly with Andy Roberts on the \\"No Hall Too Small\\" tour of village halls throughout the UK as part of the Arts Council-funded National Rural Touring Forum (NRTF).

Like all the Sarracenia, it is native to North America. Etymology In 1788, the first description of S. minor was written by Thomas Walter. The specific epithet minor means \\"small\\" and refers to the typical size of the pitchers. The common name refers to the characteristic lid of this species. Description The typical form is a relatively small plant with pitchers about in height. An especially large form, with pitchers up to high, grows in the Okefenokee marshes,D‚ÄôAmato, Peter. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley. at the border between Georgia and Florida. The tubes are mostly green throughout, but can also be reddish in the upper part. Flowering occurs late March to mid-May. Flowers are yellow in colour and odorless. Over a hundred seeds are produced by a capsule. Sarracenia minor and S. psittacina are the only species in the genus to employ domed pitchers with translucent white patches that allow light to enter. It has been suggested that the light shining through these patches attracts flying insects further into the pitcher and away from the pitcher's mouth in a similar manner to Darlingtonia californica and two Nepenthes species, N. aristolochioides and N. klossii. The pitcher is filled with water and enzymes produced by the plant and helpful in the digestion of prey. In the wild, Sarracenia minor seems very attractive to ants, although it also attracts and eats a wide range of flying insects. Distribution This plant can be found in the coastal regions of northern Florida and in Georgia up to the southern part of North Carolina. The species exhibits the southernmost range of any member of the genus Sarracenia extending to fragmented populations surrounding Lake Okeechobee in south-central Florida. Habitat It grows in swampy environments poor in nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus.

Klink III (2008), \\"Expulsion from the synagogue? Rethinking a Johannine Anachronism\\", Tyndale Bulletin. Accessed 28 May 2016 The writing of the Birkat haMinim benediction is attributed to Shmuel ha-Katan at the supposed Council of Jamnia. The theory that Jamnia finalised the canon, first proposed by Heinrich Graetz in 1871,Kohelet oder der Salomonische Prediger: Ubersetzt und Kritisch Erl√§utert, Leipzig 1871, pp. 147‚Äì173. was popular for much of the 20th century. However, it was increasingly questioned from the 1960s onward, and the theory has been largely discredited.L. M. McDonald & J. A. Sanders (eds.), The Canon Debate, Peabody (Mass.), Hendrickson Publishers, 2002, chapter 9: \\"Jamnia Revisited\\" by Jack P. Lewis, pp. 146‚Äì162. Background The Talmud relates that some time before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai relocated to the city of Yavne/Jamnia, where he received permission from the Romans to found a school of halakha (Jewish religious law).Talmud Gittin 56a‚Äìb, p. 95, Kantor The theory The Mishnah, compiled at the end of the 2nd century, describes a debate over the status of some books of Ketuvim, and in particular over whether or not they render the hands \\"impure\\". Yadaim 3:5 calls attention to a debate over Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. The Megillat Taanit, in a discussion of days when fasting is prohibited but that are not noted in the Bible, mentions the holiday of Purim. Based on these, and a few similar references, Heinrich Graetz concluded in 1871 that there had been a Council of Jamnia (or Yavne in Hebrew) which had decided the Jewish canon sometime in the late 1st century (c. 70‚Äì90). Refutation W. M. Christie was the first to dispute this popular theory in an article entitled \\"The Jamnia Period in Jewish History\\".The Journal of Theological Studies, vol. 26, July 1925, pp. 347‚Äì364. Jack P. Lewis wrote a critique of the popular consensus entitled \\"What Do We Mean by Jabneh?\\".Journal of Bible and Religion, Vol. 32, No. 2 (April 1964), pp. 125‚Äì132. Sid Z. Leiman made an independent challenge for his University of Pennsylvania thesis published later as a book in 1976.The Canonization of Hebrew Scripture: The Talmudic and Midrashic Evidence, New York, Anchor Books, 1976. Raymond E. Brown largely supported Lewis in his review published in the Jerome Biblical Commentary (also appears in the New Jerome Biblical Commentary of 1990), as did Lewis' discussion of the topic in 1992's Anchor Bible Dictionary.Anchor Bible Dictionary Vol. III, pp. 634‚Äì7 (New York 1992). Albert C. Sundberg Jr. summarized the crux of Lewis' argument as follows: > Jewish sources contain echoes of debate about biblical books but canonicity > was not the issue and debate was not connected with Jabneh... Moreover, > specific canonical discussion at Jabneh is attested only for Chronicles and > Song of Songs. Both circulated prior to Jabneh. There was vigorous debate > between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel over Chronicles and Song; Beth Hillel > affirmed that both \\"defile the hands\\". One text does speak of official > action at Jabneh. It gives a blanket statement that \\"all Holy Scripture > defile the hands\\", and adds \\"on the day they made R. Eleazar b. Azariah head > of the college, the Song of Songs and Koheleth (Ecclesiastes) both render > the hands unclean\\" (M. Yadayim 3.5). Of the apocryphal books, only Ben Sira > is mentioned by name in rabbinic sources and it continued to be circulated, > copied and cited. No book is ever mentioned in the sources as being excluded > from the canon at Jabneh. According to Lewis: > The concept of the Council of Jamnia is an hypothesis to explain the > canonization of the Writings (the third division of the Hebrew Bible) > resulting in the closing of the Hebrew canon. ...These ongoing debates > suggest the paucity of evidence on which the hypothesis of the Council of > Jamnia rests and raise the question whether it has not served its usefulness > and should be relegated to the limbo of unestablished hypotheses. It should > not be allowed to be considered a consensus established by mere repetition > of assertion. The 20th-century evangelical scholar F. F. Bruce thought that it was \\"probably unwise to talk as if there were a Council or Synod of Jamnia which laid down the limits of the Old Testament canon.\\" Other scholars have since joined in and today the theory is largely discredited. Some hold that the Hebrew canon was established during the Hasmonean dynasty (140‚Äì40 BCE).Philip R. Davies in The Canon Debate, page 50: \\"With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty.\\" References Sources * Kantor, Mattis, The Jewish timeline encyclopaedia: a year-by-year history from Creation to the present day, Jason Aronson Inc., Northvale N.J., 1992 External links * Robert C.

History  MUD was created in 1978 by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at the University of Essex on a DEC PDP-10.Sloane, Sarah (2000) Digital Fictions: Storytelling in a Material World, Ablex Publishing Corporation, , p. 168Slator, Brian M. et al \\"From Dungeons to Classrooms: The Evolution of MUDs as Learning Environments\\", in Jain, Lakhmi C., Tedman, Raymond A. & Tedman, Debra K. (eds.) (2007) Evolution of Teaching and Learning Paradigms in Intelligent Environment, Springer, , p. 121-2 Trubshaw named the game Multi-User Dungeon, in tribute to the Dungeon variant of Zork, which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing. Zork in turn was inspired by an older text-adventure game known as Colossal Cave Adventure or ADVENT. MUD1 was written in the domain-specific programming language Multi User Dungeon Definition Language (MUDDL). Its first version was written by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw in BCPL. It was later ported to C++ and used in other MUDs such as MIST. In 1980, Roy Trubshaw created MUD version 3 in BCPL (the predecessor of C), to conserve memory and make the program easier to maintain. Richard Bartle, a fellow Essex student, contributed much work on the game database, introducing many of the locations and puzzles that survive to this day. Later that year Roy Trubshaw graduated from Essex University, handing over MUD to Richard Bartle, who continued developing the game. That same year, MUD1 became the first Internet multiplayer online role- playing game as Essex University connected its internal network to the ARPANET. In 1983, Essex University allowed remote access to its DEC-10 via British Telecom's Packet Switch Stream network between 2 am and 7 am each night. MUD became popular with players around the world, and several magazines wrote articles on this new trend. Between 1984 and 1987, MUD was hosted on the DEC-20 of Dundee College of Technology which was one of the few institutions to allow outside access. In 1984, Compunet, a UK-based network primarily for Commodore 64 users, licensed MUD1 and ran it from late 1984 until 1987, when CompuNet abandoned the DEC-10 platform they were using. Trubshaw and Bartle worked together at Multi-User Entertainment to create MUD2 the second generation of MUD.\\"MUSE's Personnel\\", mud.co.uk, retrieved 2010-12-18 In 1985, Richard Bartle created MUD1 version 4, better known as MUD2. It was intended to be run as a service for British Telecom. In 1987, MUD1 was licensed by CompuServe, who pressured Richard Bartle to close down the instance of MUD1, better known as 'Essex MUD', that was still running at Essex University. This resulted in the deletion of the MUD account in October 1987. This left MIST, a derivative of MUD1 with similar gameplay, as the only remaining MUD running on the Essex University network, becoming one of the first of its kind to attain broad popularity. MIST ran until the machine that hosted it, a PDP-10, was superseded in early 1991. MUD1 ran under the name British Legends until late 1999 and was retired along with other software during CompuServe's Y2K cleanup efforts. In 2000, Viktor Toth rewrote the BCPL source code for MUD1 to C++ and opened it alongside MUD2 on British-legends.com. In 2014, Stanford University secured permission to redistribute the game's blueprints from the authors of MUD1.

In 1966 the 109th was sent to Vietnam and took operational control of the 383rd. Both units provided air drop and LAPES support during the Battle of Khe Sanh in the Vietnam War. LAPES was used to provide a method of supplying heavy loads into Khe Sanh which could not effectively be supplied by air drop. This practice was perfected at Mactan Air Base in Cebu, Philippines. Preparation for a LAPES delivery includes loading cargo on a pallet rigged with two types of parachutes (chutes). The drogue chute is used to pull a cluster of larger extraction chutes out. The deployed extraction chutes will then pull the load out of the plane. Floor locks hold the pallet in place until extraction time. The LAPES delivery procedure begins by slowing to approach speed, lowering the ramp, and opening the cargo door. To preclude damage to the aircraft from an inadvertent contact with the ground, the landing gear is lowered. The aircraft approaches the extraction zone in a manner similar to landing. On command of the pilot, the drogue chute is released and allowed to trail behind the aircraft on a tether. As the pilot flares and achieves a wheel height of 1-2 meters above ground, the drogue chute is allowed to pull the extraction chutes out into the airstream. The force of these chutes overcomes the floor locks, pulling the pallet across the ramp, out of the aircraft, and onto the extraction zone. The pilot adjusts the flight controls to remain level during the extreme change in the aircraft center of gravity caused by the pallet movement. While the pallet slides to a stop using the extraction chutes as a brake, the pilot climbs away from the extraction zone and raises the landing gear. On climb out, the rear cargo door is closed and the ramp is raised, completing the sequence. LAPES enables planes to quickly deploy large cargo in a timely fashion instead of having to land and take off, which exposes the plane to enemy fire. The technique also allows delivery of loads that are too heavy for a direct parachute descent (high altitude drop). However, the drop sequence's low altitude allows for no margin of pilot error and the risk of plane crash is heightened. On November 16, 1982, CC-130H 130329 of the Canadian Forces crashed during a LAPES operation at Namao when the load failed to clear the aircraft causing it to crash. On July 22, 1993, CC-130E 130321 of the Canadian Forces and operated by 435 Squadron, Edmonton, Alberta, crashed while performing a low-level practice LAPES drop at CFB Wainwright, Alberta. During the drop the airplane hit a berm and crashed in prairie grassland, breaking up into three pieces. Five of the nine military personnel on board died. On July 1, 1987, during a capabilities exercise (CAPEX), a USAF C-130E (68-10945 c/n 4325) crashed while performing a LAPES demo at the Sicily Drop Zone, on Fort Bragg. The pilot of the C-130 had performed a LAPES drop with the same extreme rate of descent two days earlier during a practice run. The crash killed three on board and one soldier on the ground, and injured two crew. See also * Riggers Page for Air Drop history.

He is the host of Beyond the Beltway, a syndicated talk radio show that airs on approximately 30 stations around the United States. The program, which began in 1980 as Inside Politics, also aired a televised version on Chicago's secondary PBS station, WYCC, from 1996 to 2017, when WYCC went off the air. Beyond the Beltway celebrated 30 years on the radio in June 2010; four months later DuMont recycled the title of Inside Politics, using it now to refer to the televised version of Beyond the Beltway. (It has since reverted to its original title.) DuMont got his start in broadcasting as a producer for WGN 720 AM in 1968. He interrupted his radio career to make an unsuccessful run for a seat in the Illinois Senate in 1970, then returned to WGN, this time as a producer for Howard Miller, a controversial radio personality. DuMont gained his first on-air radio experience at WLTD, now WCGO, in Evanston, Illinois, a 1,000-watt AM station at the time. It was at WLTD that he became nationally known for his investigative reporting on subjects such as Watergate and the CIA. He then began to focus on producing news and documentaries for local television. A documentary about teenage suicides for WBBM-TV earned him an Iris Award from the National Association of Television Programming, while another documentary, this one about censorship in public libraries, earned him the Golden Gavel Award from the American Bar Association. He then worked as a producer for Chicago's primary PBS station, WTTW, heading up its broadcasts of the 1983 mayoral debates between Mayor Jane Byrne and her challengers, Richard M. Daley and Harold Washington. DuMont also produced WTTW's Chicago Tonight, and his on-camera work began in 1984 as the program's anchor for both the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention. DuMont is the founder and former president of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, which began development in 1982. The MBC opened in June 1987 inside the River City condominium complex at 800 S. Wells St. in Chicago, then relocated to the Chicago Cultural Center five years later, where it remained until December 2003. After eight and a half years of delays related to construction and financing, the MBC reopened in its new location at 360 N. State St. on June 13, 2012. In August 2016 DuMont announced that he planned to retire as the museum's president; however, according to the website Chicagoland Radio and Media, \\"Officially, DuMont is voluntarily retiring from the MBC, claiming the decision is entirely his own, although in reality, there is far more behind it,\\" including alleged financial mismanagement and controversy surrounding his personal life. He officially retired from the MBC on December 31, 2017. From 1987 to 2006 he was the host of Illinois Lawmakers, a television show covering legislative news that originated from the State Capitol in Springfield during the months of the year when the Illinois General Assembly was in session. DuMont was a member of the Peabody Awards' Board of Jurors from 1992 to 1998 and is the nephew of Allen B. DuMont, founder of the DuMont Television Network.Weinstein, David (2004). The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television, p. 16. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. . He has one child, a daughter, from his first marriage, and was married to Kathy Osterman from May 1, 1992, until her death from cancer on December 8, 1992.

Sarracenia psittacina employs the same trapping mechanism as Darlingtonia californica, using a small entrance in the pitcher mouth, which prey goes through in search of more nectar that was produced by the plant on the rim of the pitcher mouth. The prey is then confused by light shining through what appear to be false exits (or \\"windows\\") and crawls toward the brighter area down into the pitcher. Criss-crossed downward-facing hairs densely line the interior of the pitcher, forcing the prey further into the pitcher to an area where digestive enzymes such as proteases are prevalent in the liquid.

The most common CCT is a mastery test where the test classifies examinees as \\"Pass\\" or \\"Fail,\\" but the term also includes tests that classify examinees into more than two categories. While the term may generally be considered to refer to all computer-administered tests for classification, it is usually used to refer to tests that are interactively administered or of variable-length, similar to computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Like CAT, variable-length CCTs can accomplish the goal of the test (accurate classification) with a fraction of the number of items used in a conventional fixed-form test. A CCT requires several components: # An item bank calibrated with a psychometric model selected by the test designer # A starting point # An item selection algorithm # A termination criterion and scoring procedure The starting point is not a topic of contention; research on CCT primarily investigates the application of different methods for the other three components. Note: The termination criterion and scoring procedure are separate in CAT, but the same in CCT because the test is terminated when a classification is made. Therefore, there are five components that must be specified to design a CAT. An introduction to CCT is found in Thompson (2007)Thompson, N. A. (2007). A Practitioner‚Äôs Guide for Variable-length Computerized Classification Testing. Practical Assessment Research & Evaluation, 12(1). and a book by Parshall, Spray, Kalohn and Davey (2006). Parshall, C. G., Spray, J. A., Kalohn, J. C., & Davey, T. (2006). Practical considerations in computer-based testing. New York: Springer. A bibliography of published CCT research is found below.  How it works  A CCT is very similar to a CAT. Items are administered one at a time to an examinee. After the examinee responds to the item, the computer scores it and determines if the examinee is able to be classified yet. If they are, the test is terminated and the examinee is classified. If not, another item is administered. This process repeats until the examinee is classified or another ending point is satisfied (all items in the bank have been administered, or a maximum test length is reached).  Psychometric model  Two approaches are available for the psychometric model of a CCT: classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Classical test theory assumes a state model because it is applied by determining item parameters for a sample of examinees determined to be in each category. For instance, several hundred \\"masters\\" and several hundred \\"nonmasters\\" might be sampled to determine the difficulty and discrimination for each, but doing so requires that you be able to easily identify a distinct set of people that are in each group. IRT, on the other hand, assumes a trait model; the knowledge or ability measured by the test is a continuum. The classification groups will need to be more or less arbitrarily defined along the continuum, such as the use of a cutscore to demarcate masters and nonmasters, but the specification of item parameters assumes a trait model. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. CTT offers greater conceptual simplicity. More importantly, CTT requires fewer examinees in the sample for calibration of item parameters to be used eventually in the design of the CCT, making it useful for smaller testing programs. See Frick (1992)Frick, T. (1992). Computerized Adaptive Mastery Tests as Expert Systems. Journal of Educational Computing Research, 8(2), 187-213. for a description of a CTT-based CCT. Most CCTs, however, utilize IRT. IRT offers greater specificity, but the most important reason may be that the design of a CCT (and a CAT) is expensive, and is therefore more likely done by a large testing program with extensive resources. Such a program would likely use IRT.  Starting point  A CCT must have a specified starting point to enable certain algorithms. If the sequential probability ratio test is used as the termination criterion, it implicitly assumes a starting ratio of 1.0 (equal probability of the examinee being a master or nonmaster). If the termination criterion is a confidence interval approach, a specified starting point on theta must be specified. Usually, this is 0.0, the center of the distribution, but it could also be randomly drawn from a certain distribution if the parameters of the examinee distribution are known. Also, previous information regarding an individual examinee, such as their score the last time they took the test (if re-taking) may be used.  Item selection  In a CCT, items are selected for administration throughout the test, unlike the traditional method of administering a fixed set of items to all examinees. While this is usually done by individual item, it can also be done in groups of items known as testlets (Leucht & Nungester, 1996;Luecht, R. M., & Nungester, R. J. (1998). Some practical examples of computer-adaptive sequential testing. Journal of Educational Measurement, 35, 229-249. Vos & Glas, 2000Vos, H.J. & Glas, C.A.W. (2000). Testlet-based adaptive mastery testing. In van der Linden, W.J., and Glas, C.A.W. (Eds.) Computerized Adaptive Testing: Theory and Practice. ). Methods of item selection fall into two categories: cutscore-based and estimate-based. Cutscore-based methods (also known as sequential selection) maximize the information provided by the item at the cutscore, or cutscores if there are more than one, regardless of the ability of the examinee. Estimate-based methods (also known as adaptive selection) maximize information at the current estimate of examinee ability, regardless of the location of the cutscore. Both work efficiently, but the efficiency depends in part on the termination criterion employed. Because the sequential probability ratio test only evaluates probabilities near the cutscore, cutscore-based item selection is more appropriate. Because the confidence interval termination criterion is centered around the examinees ability estimate, estimate-based item selection is more appropriate. This is because the test will make a classification when the confidence interval is small enough to be completely above or below the cutscore (see below). The confidence interval will be smaller when the standard error of measurement is smaller, and the standard error of measurement will be smaller when there is more information at the theta level of the examinee.  Termination criterion  There are three termination criteria commonly used for CCTs. Bayesian decision theory methods offer great flexibility by presenting an infinite choice of loss/utility structures and evaluation considerations, but also introduce greater arbitrariness. A confidence interval approach calculates a confidence interval around the examinee's current theta estimate at each point in the test, and classifies the examinee when the interval falls completely within a region of theta that defines a classification. This was originally known as adaptive mastery testing (Kingsbury & Weiss, 1983), but does not necessarily require adaptive item selection, nor is it limited to the two- classification mastery testing situation. The sequential probability ratio test (Reckase, 1983) defines the classification problem as a hypothesis test that the examinee's theta is equal to a specified point above the cutscore or a specified point below the cutscore.

Carstensen) is a life-span theory of motivation. The theory maintains that as time horizons shrink, as they typically do with age, people become increasingly selective, investing greater resources in emotionally meaningful goals and activities. According to the theory, motivational shifts also influence cognitive processing. Aging is associated with a relative preference for positive over negative information in have had rewarding relationships.Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. This selective narrowing of social interaction maximizes positive emotional experiences and minimizes emotional risks as individuals become older. According to this theory, older adults systematically hone their social networks so that available social partners satisfy their emotional needs. The theory also focuses on the types of goals that individuals are motivated to achieve. Knowledge-related goals aim at knowledge acquisition, career planning, the development of new social relationships and other endeavors that will pay off in the future. Emotion- related goals are aimed at emotion regulation, the pursuit of emotionally gratifying interactions with social partners and other pursuits whose benefits can be realized in the present. When people perceive their future as open ended, they tend to focus on future-oriented and development- or knowledge- related goals, but when they feel that time is running out and the opportunity to reap rewards from future-oriented goals' realization is dwindling, their focus tends to shift towards present-oriented and emotion- or pleasure-related goals. Research on this theory often compares age groups (e.g., young adulthood vs. old adulthood), but the shift in goal priorities is a gradual process that begins in early adulthood. Importantly, the theory contends that the cause of these goal shifts is not age itself, i.e., not the passage of time itself, but rather an age-associated shift in time perspective. This justified shift in perspective is the rational equivalent of the psychological perceptual disorder known as \\"foreshortened future,\\" in which an individual, usually a young and physically healthy individual, unreasonably believes (either consciously or unconsciously) that his/her time horizons are more limited than they actually are, with the effect that the individual undervalues long-term goals and long-run pleasure and instead disproportionately pursues short-term goals and pleasure, thereby diverting resources from investment for the future and often even actively reducing his/her long-term prospects. Cross-cultural incidence Researchers have found that across diverse samples ‚Äì ranging from Norwegians to Catholic nuns to African-Americans to Chinese Americans to European-Americans ‚Äì older adults report better control of their emotions and fewer negative emotions than do younger adults. At the same time, culture seems to color how aging-related effects impact one's emotional life: Whereas older Americans were shown to de- emphasize negative experiences more than younger Americans, no such effect has been observed in Japan. Instead, older Japanese were shown to assign a greater value to positive aspects of otherwise negative experiences than younger Japanese, whereas no such effect has been observed in the U.S. Positivity effect in older adults = In perception = Studies have found that older adults are more likely than younger adults to pay attention to positive than negative stimuli (as assessed by the dot-probe paradigm and eye-tracking methods). However, the effect also differs across cultures. For example, Hong Kong Chinese looked away from happy stimuli and more towards fearful stimuli, and the difference in attention pattern was related to differences in self- construal. = In recall = The term positivity effect also refers to age differences in emotional attention and memory. As people get older, they experience fewer negative emotions and they tend to look to the past in a positive light. In addition, compared with younger adults' memories, older adults' memories are more likely to consist of positive than negative information and more likely to be distorted in a positive direction. This version of the positivity effect was coined by Laura L. Carstensen's research team. There is a debate about the cross-cultural generalizability of the aging-related positivity effect, with some evidence for different types of emotional processing among Americans as compared to Japanese. Hypothesized causes One theory of the positivity effect in older adults' memories is that it is produced by cognitive control mechanisms that improve and decrease negative information due to older adults' greater focus on emotional regulation. Research shows an age-related reversal in the valence of information processed within the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). In younger adults, more MPFC activity was found in the presence of negative stimuli compared to positive stimuli whereas in older adults this was reversed. However, the positivity effect may be different for stimuli processed automatically (pictures) and stimuli processed in a more controlled manner (words). Compared to words, pictures tend to be processed more rapidly and they engage emotion processing centres earlier. Automatic stimuli are processed in the amygdala and dorsal MPFC, whereas controlled stimuli are processed in the temporal pole and ventral MPFC. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed less amygdala activation and more MPFC activation for negative than positive pictures. Increased motivation to regulate emotion leads older adults to actively engage the mPFC differently from younger adults, which in turn yields diverging amygdala activation patterns. The opposite pattern was observed for words. Although older adults showed a positivity effect in memory for words, they did not display one for pictures.

It had already been placed in Gliophorus, but it had been considered a synonym of Hygrocybe. Description G. psittacinus on Faroe Islands stamp The Parrot Toadstool is a small mushroom, with a convex to umbonate cap 1‚Äì3 centimetres (‚Öì‚Äì1 in) in diameter, which is green when young and later yellowish or even pinkish tinged. The 2‚Äì4 cm stipe is green to greenish yellow. The broad adnate gills are greenish with yellow edges and spore print white. The green colouring persists at the stem apex even in old specimens. Its odour and taste are not distinctive. There are no known chemical tests. It fruits late summer to autumn (September to November) Distribution and habitat Gliophorus psittacinus is widely distributed in grasslands in Western Europe, United Kingdom, Iceland, Greenland, the Americas, South Africa, Japan, being found in late summer and autumn. In Europe it is apparently in decline due to the degradation of habitats. Early Australian records of this form have been found to be the similar green toadstools Gliophorus graminicolor or G. viridis on reexamination.

In the show, Tom Dickson, the Blendtec founder, attempts to blend various unusual items in order to show off the power of his blender. Dickson started this marketing campaign after doing a blending experiment with a box of matches.Esquire. Will it Blend?

Although the show's example was blended with the bones (and thus was disclaimed as unsafe to eat), a boneless version was made on NBC's TodayRachael King, \\"Business goes straight to video\\", BusinessWeek, January 16, 2007. and served to Meredith Vieira. On the April 3, 2007 episode, Dickson placed a camcorder in the blender, giving viewers a first-person look inside the container while it was blended. Shortly afterwards, the production team, Kels Goodman and Ray Hansen, attempted to return what was left of the camcorder to Best Buy, with no success.YouTube - Will It Blend? Video Camera Part 2: The Return On the July 10, 2007, episode, an iPhone played the video intro before being blended. The resulting remains of the iPhone (which consisted of powder and a mangled metal frame), along with a brand new Blendtec blender and a DVD compilation of the commercials, were put up for auction on eBay and sold at US$901 (which was given to charity). This was repeated with an iPhone 3G on the July 11, 2008, episode, with the eBay auction including a \\"Will It Blend\\" t-shirt, an autographed jar (holding the blended remains of the phone), the box the iPhone came in (including the earphones), and a brand new Blendtec Total Blender. On the April 5, 2010, episode, an iPad was blended after being smashed to fit into the blender. The number of views this video received prompted Dickson to set up a contest on blendtec.com to give away either the shredded or the boxed iPad. Each comes with a free Blendtec Total Blender. On the June 25, 2010, episode, an iPhone 4 was blended. Tom Dickson blending at YouTube Live Some episodes are produced to coincide with certain events.

The organization aims to \\"strengthen U.S./Armenia and U.S. relations, promotes Armenia's democratic development and economic prosperity and seeks universal affirmation of the Armenian Genocide\\" via \\"research, education and advocacy.\\" History In the early 70's, Armenian-Americans decided to create an organization, headquartered in the U.S. capital, to represent and promote Armenian interests. With Armenian-American community members across the country, they launched the Armenian Assembly in 1972. Ultimately, the coalition did not hold, but in its place was born a non-partisan organization dedicated to promoting public understanding and awareness of Armenian issues. The Assembly would go on to launch a broad array of programs and initiatives and firmly establish itself as an Armenian voice within U.S. public policy circles. It would pioneer initiatives to commemorate and reaffirm the Armenian Genocide. And as early as 1977, the Assembly would introduce a summer intern program in Washington, DC that, some 32 years later, could claim more than 900 graduates. Beginning in 1988 and thereafter, the Assembly addressed the unprecedented challenges of Armenia's earthquake, Nagorno Karabakh's struggle for self-determination and Armenia's independence movement. With Administration support, Congress mandated first-ever earthquake relief funding to then Soviet Armenia. Annual U.S. assistance became the norm, the next ten years totaling more than $1.4 billion. The Assembly was also instrumental in encouraging our friends in Congress to form a Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues. It would become one of the largest caucuses, working side-by-side with the Assembly in supporting Armenian-American interests. The Armenia Tree Project (ATP) was established in 1993 to assist the Armenian people in using trees to advance their social, economic and environmental recovery. Some 300,000 plantings later, ATP's vision continues to bloom throughout Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. Efforts also continued unabated to secure universal reaffirmation of the Armenian Genocide, enhanced significantly in 1997 with the launch of the Assembly's Armenian National Institute (ANI). ANI is at the forefront of efforts to affirm the Armenian Genocide, responding to denial and advance knowledge and understanding of the Genocide and its consequences. Completing three decades of non-partisan service, the Assembly family of organizations remains in the forefront of strengthening the U.S./Armenia and U.S./Karabakh relationships. NGO Training and Resource Center In April 1994, the Armenian Assembly of America established the NGO Training and Resource Center with support from the \\"Save the Children\\" USAID fund. The center aims to strengthen domestic Armenian Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in hopes of encouraging wider participation in the democratic processes. The center provides, to more than 300 local registered NGOs, the following services: * ten-week training program focusing on the leadership and management of the organization; * technical assistance to help participants implement change within their organization; * public relations department to raise public awareness about NGO Sector in Armenia and to promote their activities and projects; * seminar/workshop series. Spending According to OpenSecrets.org, the Armenian Assembly of America allocated the following sums to its lobbying activities: * 2000 - $270,000 * 2001 - $240,000 * 2002 - $140,000 * 2003 - $180,000 * 2004 - $220,000 * 2005 - $220,000 * 2006 - $180,000 * 2007 - $320,000 See also * Armenian American Action Committee (ARAMAC) * Armenian American Political Action Committee * Armenian-American * List of Armenian-Americans * Armenian Diaspora * Little Armenia, Los Angeles, California References External links * Category:Armenian-American culture Category:Armenia‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Foreign policy political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Armenian Genocide ","title":"Armenian Assembly of America"},{"id":"7955512","text":"King Stephen, Op. 117 (K√∂nig Stephan) is a commemorative work composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1811.

With voices by Allan Sherman and prolific vocal performer Daws Butler, this half-hour special is a loose adaptation with added musical sequences. Plot As the story opens, it is too rainy and too cold to play outside, so two kids named Sally and Conrad sit bored and look out the window. Their mother announces that she is ready to depart, then tells them to have fun and says she'll return at 3:30 sharp. While their mother is out, they have no other choice but to think of something to do (\\"Nothing To Be Done\\"). The mysterious Cat in the Hat suddenly enters with a bump and fools around a bit. The family goldfish named \\"Karlos K. Krinklebein\\" orders him to leave, but instead the Cat plays a game which he calls \\"Up, Up, Up, With a Fish\\", placing the fishbowl on top of a stack of bubbles. The children notice that the Cat is making the house a little untidy, and Conrad recalls their mother's projected return at 3:30. Noting their objections, the Cat bows to the voice of the majority and dejectedly states that he is going to Siberia, Russia. Immediately after leaving, however, the Cat bursts back in claiming that his \\"moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\\" has been stolen. The Cat accuses Karlos of being the thief, and sings a ballad about the loss of his treasured keepsake (\\"Family Gredunza\\"). The Cat then leads the kids on a search for the missing gredunza using his method of (\\"Calculatus Eliminatus\\"), in which random numbers and letters are drawn anywhere the gredunza should be to mark that they have already checked there. This makes a mess of everything, and Karlos once again orders the Cat to leave. Ostensibly to gain sympathy, the Cat sings a pessimistic song (\\"I'm a Punk\\") to convey his low self-esteem, then puts Karlos to sleep by singing a lullaby (\\"Beautiful Kittenfish\\", in the melody of \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\"). Having made a miraculous recovery from his bout of depression, the Cat brings out Thing One and Thing Two to aid in the search for the gredunza, singing to the kids that they can find (\\"Anything Under the Sun\\"), but instead of being productive, the Things play a variety of sports using Karlos' fishbowl, noting that every house they visit has a pessimistic fish ‚Äúwhose only one wish is to flatten the fun.‚Äù Frustrated, Karlos accuses the Cat of not being a real cat, and his hat of not being a real hat. However, the Cat indignantly asserts his legitimacy by singing his name in several languages (\\"Cat, Hat\\"). The tune becomes so catchy that everyone, even Karlos, joins in and contributes, telling the Cat that in Russian he is a \\"chapka in a shlyapa\\". As the song ends, a car horn is heard in the distance. Karlos spots the kids' mother on her way home. The Things get back into their box and disappear, then the Cat exits immediately after. With the house an extreme mess, the kids wonder how they'll clean the house in time. The Cat quickly returns, using a motorized vehicle to tidy things up in a jiffy. After cleaning the house, he departs, hinting that he may return someday (\\"Sweep Up the Memories\\"). Just as he departs through the back door, the mother walks in through the front door; she asks the kids how their day was, and then tells them that she just saw a cat in a hat \\"going down the street with a moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\\". The exact identity of the object has never been revealed, but this indicates that the gredunza was never really lost, and the Cat simply wanted an excuse to have more fun. Sally and Conrad look out the window much as they did at the beginning of the special, and watch as the Cat walks off to his next adventure.

After MGM stopped animation production and closed down its animation department for good in 1970, production was moved to DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises (marking the company's first Dr. Seuss television special), which was run by Jones' fellow Warner Bros. Cartoons alumnus Friz Freleng and WB's last original production executive David DePatie. Although Chuck Jones and his staff were retained by DePatie‚ÄìFreleng in the production of the special, Jones left the studio and did not work on any other Seuss projects after The Cat in the Hat. Other staff members that have worked with Jones such as Dean Elliott and Maurice Noble eventually stopped working on Seuss projects also. DePatie and Freleng were credited together as executive producers, while Jones was credited as producer with Seuss (under his actual name). For the next three Dr. Seuss animation specials, Freleng and Seuss (again using his real name) were credited as producers, although separately. DePatie‚ÄìFreleng animated a new Cat in the Hat Productions logo for this special, which would be used in the next three specials. The pace and rhyming sequences of several of the songs (particularly \\"Calculatus Eliminatus\\") led many to believe that they were composed by Sherman, since they closely resemble his earlier song parodies, however only Seuss is credited. Differences from the book The plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. Among the many deviations, the sequence in the book where the Cat balances all sorts of objects while standing on a ball, only to overdo it and come crashing down, is left out. The closest equivalent is the fishbowl and bubbles sequences. Also differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the Cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat's \\"moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\\". The vocabulary used in the special is also on a higher level than the book's, though still in Seuss' trademark rhyme. Home media The special was originally released as a VHS videocassette on the CBS/Fox Video label's Playhouse Video imprint in 1989. It was later released as part of the Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics release from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment with CBS Video and Fox Kids Video in the mid-1990s. It was later released on DVD by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment/Universal Studios Family Productions on October 7, 2003. Warner Home Video released the special on Blu- ray and DVD on August 7, 2012. The Cat in other TV specials and series Although the original book's sequel The Cat in the Hat Comes Back did not receive an animated adaptation, the character went on to appear in several more Dr. Seuss specials. In 1973, there came Dr. Seuss on the Loose, where Sherman reprised his role as The Cat in the Hat. Here, The Cat in the Hat appeared in bridging sequences where he introduced animated adaptations of three other Dr. Seuss stories: The Sneetches, The Zax and Green Eggs and Ham. In 1982's The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat, the character, now voiced by Mason Adams (Sherman had died shortly after Dr. Seuss on the Loose finished production), meets the title character of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and sets out to reform his new green adversary. In 1995, the Cat appeared again, this time with the voice of Henry Gibson, to narrate Daisy-Head Mayzie, a special based on a posthumously published Dr. Seuss book. In 1996, a puppet version of the Cat starred in The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, where he was voiced by Bruce Lanoil and Martin P. Robinson. The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!, an educational animated series based on the Random House Library series, premiered in September 2010; the Cat is voiced by Martin Short.

When this does not work, Comic Book Guy tries to use the weapons to destroy Coolsville, but is subdued by the three authors who remove their shirts to reveal muscular super-hero physiques. After comparing herself to a cardboard cutout of Wonder Woman, Marge decides to become slimmer. While exercising at a large gym, she struggles with the treadmill and is embarrassed showering in public, and as a result decides to open a gym for ordinary women. Comic Book Guy, having finally given up, closes the Android's Dungeon which Marge then acquires in order to open \\"Shapes\\", a women-only workout center that is an immediate hit. Many women of Springfield comment on Marge's efforts; she opens another location at an abandoned Krusty Burger. After an interview on the women's television show Opal, Marge becomes an international hit. Homer and Marge go on a luxury vacation at a hotel. Homer meets a group of three strapping young men who tell him he is on \\"wife support\\". They are all \\"trophy\\" husbands and convince Homer that Marge will soon dump him for a healthier man. They list the stages that will occur in their marriage before Marge dumps him. As these begin to occur, Homer overhears Marge talking to a group of women about dumping something. Homer assumes it is him, although she is actually talking about her purse. One of the three younger men tells Homer he is actually a first husband who used to be fat and ugly, but transformed himself through fashion, diet and exercise. Homer, however, decides that he needs to get cosmetic surgery. Homer attempts to win Marge back by having his stomach stapled. He is now much slimmer and has to liquify his food. Homer lures Marge into bed and turns her on, but has to make sure only his front is exposed as all of his excess skin is tied back behind him. Next, Homer gets extreme plastic surgery done. When finished, Homer looks entirely different; he is slim with well-defined musculature, narrower eyes, and a full head of black hair, and his tear ducts have been moved to his nipples among other things. At a ceremony in which Mayor Quimby rewards Marge for her work with Shapes, Homer arrives in his new form, much to the shock and disgust of the town. Quimby orders the town to bring pitchforks and attack Homer. Homer and Marge run to the top of Springfield's Notre Dame tower and Marge, saying she wants a trophy husband, deliberately pushes Homer off the tower. Homer wakes up in the hospital, back to his old self. Marge informs him that after he was knocked out, the surgeon requested her permission for the surgery and she refused; everything from Homer's surgery to his \\"death\\" was just a dream. She had the doctor reverse Homer's stomach stapling, since she loves him no matter how he looks. The episode ends with Moore, Spiegelman, and Clowes watching Homer and Marge from mid-air. They notice that a meteor is headed for Earth, but become distracted by news of a convention for underpaid writers. They fly away and allow the meteor to strike. Production Alan Moore recorded his lines in October 2006, after the writers approached his then fianc√©e Melinda Gebbie. He is a fan of the show.

It serves approximately 470 high school students and employs approximately 40 high school teachers and other support staff. Randolph High School was established in 1962, and was the first high school located entirely within an existing Air Force Base.  Overview  In 2017, Randolph High School was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency, with a 1-Star Distinction for Academic Achievement in Social Studies. In 2005 Randolph was ranked the 15th-best high school in Texas by the Texas Education Excellence Project. The school has been a Texas Education Agency Exemplary School multiple times, most recently in 2009 and 2010.TEA 2009 Campus Accountability TablesTEA 2010 Campus Accountability Tables Technology Beginning in 2003 students were issued 1:1 laptop computers for classroom and personal use during the school year, but had to return their computers before the end of the year. In 2011, the school purchased Promethean Boards for every classroom and in 2013 the school received a DODEA grant to provide all students and teachers with Apple iPad Air tablets. Construction From 2007 to 2008, the school underwent construction to renovate the gymnasium and add a one-million- dollar fine arts center. The fine arts center was named the Richard L. Wilson Fine Arts Center in 2009 for the schools most successful band director from 1995 to 2008. Wilson's bands never placed lower than first place in more than 35 marching band competitions and he led the marching bands to seven consecutive appearances in the bi-annual State Marching Contest. In 2015, the school district received a grant to construct a new high school, located directly behind the current high school. The new high school opened August 2016. Classes In addition to the core classes, courses include Sociology, Spanish language, Business Computers, Video Tech, Music Theory, Sports Medicine, and several advanced placement (AP) courses. Athletics The Ro- Hawks currently fields teams in football, cross country, volleyball, basketball, power lifting, swimming, tennis, golf, baseball, softball, bowling & track/field. The girls track and field team placed 7th in 2005 and then won the 2A State Championship three consecutive times in 2006, 2007, and 2008, making it the first high school in the San Antonio area to repeat since 1989. In 2009, the team took their first 2nd place title. In 2012, the team won their 4th state championship in girls track and field.2011-2012 UIL State Champions In 2015 the Boys' Basketball team made their 3rd trip (1992, 1994) to the UIL State Basketball Tournament at the Alamodome in San Antonio.

The Ro-Hawks would fall to the Eagles 37-32 marking the end of a historic season, finishing 31-4 overall. 2014-2015 3A Boys Basketball State Results The school prides itself that its mascot, the \\"Ro-Hawk\\", is the only mascot of its kind in Texas and the United States. Ro-Hawk is a combination of the words rocket & hawks. The image is a hawk riding a rocket with a lightning bolt clenched in its talon. Rumor has it that upon opening the school the school board could not decide on a mascot. Half of its members wanted Rockets, which was already in use by nearby Judson High School, and half wanted Hawks, to keep with the Air Force Academy's use of bird mascots (Falcons). So, as a compromise, Ro-Hawks was selected. Band The award-winning Mighty Randolph Ro-Hawk Marching Band won every marching competition they entered from 1997 to 2009, an 11-year streak. The band received superior ratings (the highest available) at the Regional level for 20 consecutive years, and is distinguished as one of the Top 10 Marching Bands in its classification in the state of Texas (260+ bands). The band has advanced to the bi-annual Area Marching Contest every year since 1995, and in 2009 they took first place in both the preliminary round (20 bands) and final round (10 bands). This earned the Ro-Hawks a 7th straight appearance in the Texas State Marching Band Contest. Notable alumni * Carl J.

The term chevron was originally used independently by Maxwell and HaynesMaxwell, T.A. and Haynes, C.V., Jr., 1989. Large-scale, low-amplitude bedforms (chevrons) in the Selima Sand Sheet, Egypt: Science v. 243, p. 1179-1182. and Hearty and others for large, V-shaped, sub-linear to parabolic landforms in southwestern Egypt and on islands in the eastern, windward Bahamas. General The Egyptian ‚Äúchevrons‚Äù are active, wind-generated dunes, but the ‚Äúchevrons‚Äù in the Bahamas are inactive and have been variously interpreted. The most common interpretation of large, chevron-shaped bed forms is that they are a form of parabolic dune, and that most examples are generated by wind action. Many chevrons can be found in Australia, but others are concentrated around the coastlines of the world. For instance there are chevrons in Hither Hills State Park on Long Island and in Madagascar (such as the Fenambosy Chevron), as well as in interior sites of the United States such as the Palouse region of eastern Washington State, the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, and White Sands National Park. Formation According to Hansen et al. 2015, powerful storms and changes in sea level rise can explain chevrons, as the study elaborates: The lightly indurated ooid sand ridges are several kilometers long (Bahamas) and appear to have originated from the action of long-period waves from a northeasterly Atlantic source. The chevron ridges contain bands of beach fenestrae, formed by air bubbles trapped in fine ooid sand inundated by water and quickly indurated. The internal sedimentary structures including the beach fenestrae and scour structures (Tormey, 2015) show that the chevrons were rapidly emplaced by water rather than wind (Hearty et al., 1998). These landforms were deposited near the end of a sea level high stand, when sea level was just beginning to fall, otherwise they would have been reworked subsequently by stable or rising seas. Some chevrons contain multiple smaller ridges ‚Äúnested‚Äù in a seaward direction (Hearty et al., 1998), providing further evidence that sea level was falling fast enough to strand and preserve older chevrons as distinct landforms. Older ridges adjacent to the chevron ridges have wave runup deposits that reach heights nearly 40 m above present sea level, far above the reach of a quiescent 5e sea surface. Such elevated beach fenestrae are considered to result from runup of very large waves (Wanless and Dravis, 1989). These stratigraphically youngest deposits on the shore-parallel ridges are 1-5 m thick fenestrae-filled seaward-sloping tabular beds of stage 5e age that mantle older MIS 5e dune deposits (Neumann and Moore, 1975; Chen at al., 1991; Neumann and Hearty, 1996; Tormey, 2015). Runup beds reach more than a kilometer from the present coast, mantling the eastern flanks of stage 5e ridges (Hearty et al., 1998). Bain and Kindler (1994) suggested the fenestrae could be raingenerated, but the fenestrae at high elevations are widespread and exclusive to the late 5e deposits. They are not commonly found in older dune ridges (Hearty et al., 1998). Movement of these sediments, including chevrons, run-up deposits and boulders, required a potent sustained energy source. Anticipating our interpretation in terms of powerful storms driven by an unusually warm tropical ocean and strong zonal temperature gradients in the North Atlantic, we must ask whether there should not be evidence of comparable end-Eemian storms in Bermuda. Indeed, there are seaward sloping planar beds rising to about +20 m along several kilometers of the north coast of Bermuda (Land et al., 1967; Vacher and Rowe, 1997; Hearty et al., 1998). In an alternative view, the Holocene Impact Research Group hypothesizes that the formations could be caused by tsunamis from meteorite impacts or submarine slides which lift sediment up and carry it hundreds of miles until depositing it on coastlines.Gusiakov, V. Abbott, D.H., Bryant, E.A., Masse, W.B., and Breger, D., 2010. Mega tsunami of the world oceans: Chevron dune formation, micro-ejecta, and rapid climate change as the evidence of recent oceanic bolide impacts: T. Beer (ed.), Geophysical Hazards, p. 197-227; Springer Publ. Part of the evidence they cite for this hypothesis is that the sediments contain tiny marine fossils; however, such fossils can be moved by the wind, just like sand. The impact idea is controversial not only because chevrons are similar to wind-blown landforms found far from the ocean, but also because it is unlikely that there have been enough large impacts and landslides to explain the observed chevrons. Moreover, some computer models and sediment-transport analysis do not support this theory. For example, the orientation of chevrons along the southern coast of Madagascar do not line up with what these models of mega-tsunamis have simulated. Additional evidence against the mega-tsunami hypothesis is that the force of the water would not produce such regular bed forms.

William Hutton (30 September 1723 ‚Äì 20 September 1815) was an English poet and historian. Originally from Derby, he moved to Birmingham and became the first significant historian of the city, publishing his History of Birmingham in 1781. Biography A Unitarian nonconformist born in Derby, William Hutton went to school when five years old. Aged seven years he was employed in a Derby Silk Mill on a seven-year apprenticeship. In 1737 he took a second apprenticeship as a stocking maker in Nottingham under his uncle. In 1746, after his uncle had died, he taught himself bookbinding, and three years later opened a shop in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This was not successful and he moved to Birmingham in 1750 and opened a small bookshop. Hutton married Sarah Cock from Aston-on-Trent in 1755 and they had three sons and a daughter, Catherine Hutton (1756‚Äì1846), who became a writer. In 1756, Hutton opened a paper warehouse ‚Äì the first in Birmingham ‚Äì which became profitable. He built a country house on Bennetts Hill in Washwood Heath, and bought a house in High Street. He published his History of Birmingham in 1782 and was also elected as Fellow of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland (F. A. S. S.). He was elected overseer of the poor, and in 1787, to the Court of Requests, a small claims court for 19 years, handling over 100,000 claims. Both Hutton's houses were destroyed in the Birmingham Riots in 1791 (the Priestley Riots) leading to his historical account in Narrative of the riots. He managed to recover ¬£5,390 in a claim for damages against the town. William Hutton is generally held to be the first person in modern times to walk the entire length of Hadrian's Wall, producing an account of his 1801 journey in The History of the Roman Wall.Breeze 2006:16. Walking 600 miles from his Birmingham home, along the wall, and back home again, he wrote in the preface, \\"I have given a short sketch of my approach to this famous Bulwark; have described it as it appears in the present day, and stated my return. Perhaps, I am the first man that ever traveled the whole length of this Wall, and probably the last that will ever attempt it ...\\". Hutton lived chiefly on a vegetarian diet.Hutton, William (1723-1815). Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900. Legacy Blue plaque to William Hutton in Birmingham. Hutton completed his autobiography The life of William Hutton just before his death in 1815. He is commemorated by a blue plaque on Waterstone's bookshop on High Street, near the start of New Street, Birmingham and as a Bas relief on Derby's Exeter Bridge close to the Mill where he did his apprenticeship. A memorial exists in St Margaret's Church, Ward End. There is a portrait of William Hutton by an unknown artist in Derby Museum and Art Gallery.

At this point, the group of 11 men began meeting regularly in a German Ratskeller called \\"Haan's Ladies' and Gentlemen's Restaurant, Cafe and Rathskeller\\". Official school recognition of AEPi was granted on November 7. The founding members intended for AEPi to be a national fraternity even before the second chapter at NYU was designated \\"Alpha Chapter.\\" In 1917, the local fraternity Phi Tau at Cornell University became the Beta Chapter of AEPi. Only fifty-two men had been initiated into AEPi at the start of World War I. Almost every undergraduate and alumnus of the fraternity served in the military, causing the fraternity to become nearly inactive during the war years. In the years between the world wars, Alpha Epsilon Pi grew to twenty-eight chapters. Expansion remained dormant throughout World War II as many fraternity members served in the war effort. With the end of the war and the shift of the national headquarters to St. Louis, Alpha Epsilon Pi had gained new life and momentum in its reopening of inactive chapters, expansion to new campuses, and the merging with other locals that had seen reduced membership as a result of the war. In 1940, Sigma Omega Psi joined Alpha Epsilon Pi adding three chapters, as did Sigma Tau Phi in 1947. The next two decades were a time of steady growth for Alpha Epsilon Pi, as well as other fraternities. However, with the onset of fighting in Vietnam in the early 1960s, fraternity life faltered. Liberal student bodies revolted against authority and the Greek system, which was seen as a conservative, elitist group. Membership plummeted and nearly half the chapter roll was lost. However, the fraternity was able to reverse the trend and stabilize membership numbers following the end of the Vietnam War. In 2009, AEPi became the first fraternity to establish a chapter in Israel at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. In 2014, AEPi was the first college student organization to be admitted as a full member to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. In 2015, AEPi became the first fraternity to establish a chapter in Australia. Coat of arms To Brothers it is known as the \\"Cofa,\\" arranged by the initials of the phrase. The coat of arms of Alpha Epsilon Pi contains a number of symbolic objects, the true meaning of which is only revealed to brothers during their initiation into the fraternity. Regardless, the coat of arms does contain symbols which have a history in Judaism obvious to the uninitiated and even to non-Jewish people. The crest of the arms contains a menorah intertwined with a star of David. Also, the top of the arms has a lion that could be the Lion of Judah. Chapter organization AEPi has specific titles that are used for its officers; many correspond to Fraternal tradition. *President ‚Äî Master *Vice President ‚Äî Lieutenant Master *Secretary ‚Äî Scribe *Treasurer ‚Äî Exchequer *Sergeant at Arms ‚Äî Brother at Large *Master of Ceremonies ‚Äî Sentinel *Head of Recruitment ‚Äî Rush Chair *Pledge Educator ‚Äî Pledge Master Alleged discriminatory practices and controversies Alpha Epsilon Pi's mission statement describing a \\"non-discriminatory fraternity\\" has often come under fire, particularly under former Executive Director Andrew Borans. In 1990, Alpha Epsilon Pi brothers at MIT decided to disband their chapter after the international fraternity kicked out 45 of 55 members of the chapter. Members believed it was largely in part due to the international fraternity's desire to re-colonize the chapter as a Jewish fraternity. Joseph P. Wong, former Vice President of the chapter who was invited to stay, was quoted saying \\"AEPi is inherently discriminatory and does not deserve a place on this campus\\". In 1998, members of the UCLA chapter dropped out, stating that the international organization was \\"discriminatory against non-Jewish pledges\\". In 2009, the Mu chapter at University of Virginia was shut down, with members claiming the international fraternity told them they \\"weren't Jewish enough\\". In 2015, the Beta Rho chapter at Brown University disaffiliated with Alpha Epsilon Pi, citing mistreatment of non-Jewish members by their international organization, and a lack of emphasis by the international organization on sexual assault education. In 2016, a freshman female student at College of Charleston sued the fraternity after she stated she was disrobed, served drugs and alcohol, and raped while one of the fraternity members recorded the assault on his cellphone during the fraternity's Bid Day celebration party. In her lawsuit, it states she had been seeking unspecified damages for her \\"serious personal injuries\\" that have required hospitalization, doctor's care and other treatment. As a result of the lawsuit, two fraternity members, Timothy Eli Seppi and James F. West III, identified in the incident were arrested and released on bail and the fraternity charter was revoked. In 2018, all but one brother at the chapter at Union College resigned their life membership in AEPi in response to perceived discrimination by the international fraternity against non-Jewish brothers. In this case, membership audits were facilitated by the international office. This resulted in the removal of every active non- Jewish brother, while only a single Jewish brother was removed by the international office. The international office cited \\"continued non-compliance with the health and safety regulations of the national organization\\"; however, many of those removed were new to the chapter and, therefore, could not possibly have violated any of these regulations. In 2019, the chapter at the University of Arizona was kicked off campus for code-of-conduct violations including alcohol use, hazing and bodily harm to pledges.https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona- education/2019/11/13/alpha-epsilon-pi-fraternity-loses-status-ua-hazing- investigation/4181621002/ In 2019, the chapter at Emory University was mandated to shut down for at least two years due to hazing pledges and alcohol violations.https://emorywheel.com/aepi-suspended-for-at-least-two-years/ In 2020, the chapter at Pennsylvania State University was suspended due to four members being accused of sexual assault at their fraternity house.https://nypost.com/2020/01/23/penn-state-frat-suspended-after-four- members-are-accused-of-sex- assault/https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn- state/article239497338.html In 2020, the chapter at the University of St Andrews suspended several members over allegations of more than twelve rapes and sexual assaults, but in the absence of any formal complaint no member was expelled. International organization structure AEPi is governed in a diamond model. It consists of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Foundation, the Fiscal Control Board, the Executive Office and the Supreme Board of Governors. The Alpha Epsilon Pi Foundation is the charitable arm of the organization. It directs the philanthropic affairs of the fraternity, supports projects of a Jewish and fraternal nature, and provides support for the individual chapters and colonies. They work very closely with the Director of Jewish Programming. The Fiscal Control Board (FCB) is responsible for the financial well-being of the organization. It oversees the financial decisions of the apparatus, and makes recommendations to the Supreme Board of Governors. Each member of the FCB is also on the Board of Directors of the AEPi Foundation. The Executive Office is made up of the professional staff that oversees the day-to-day functions of the fraternity. The staff consists of the housing coordinator, the leadership consultants, the Director of Jewish Programming, and the Executive Director. The current Chief Executive Officer is Jim Fleischer. The Supreme Board of Governors is made up of 11 positions: Supreme Master (President); Supreme Master-Elect (President-Elect/VP); Supreme Scribe (Secretary); Supreme Exchequer (Treasurer); Supreme Sentinel (Sergeant-at- Arms); five Supreme Governors at-large (other alumni members); and the Immediate Past Supreme Master The Supreme Board of Governors makes the majority of decisions for the fraternity's well-being and meets semi-annually to discuss matters of importance, including the granting of charters. Leadership input to the SBG from the undergraduate membership is accepted from The Undergraduate Cabinet, whose members are elected annually in the winter. Notable alumni Alpha Epsilon Pi has notable alumni across many different industries and fields. AEPi counts among its members at least 7 billionaires, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson. Alumni also include the founders of Tinder, Lyft, Home Depot and Hotels.com as well as former/current presidents or chairmen of Citigroup, ESPN, MGM Studios, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and NBC Television. In sports, AEPi alumni include the founder and first owner of the Harlem Globetrotters, current owner of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox, the CEO of the Atlanta Hawks, president of the Florida Panthers, the commissioner of the National Hockey League and at least 2 Olympians. In American politics, AEPi has had at least 6 U.S. Representatives, 1 U.S. Senator, 1 U.S. Governor, a former Israeli Ambassador to the United States and a U.S. State Supreme Court Justice. In Canadian politics, AEPi alumni include the former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, the current and one former Israeli Ambassador to Canada, as well as Canada's first Jewish Cabinet member and Deputy Prime Minister of Canada. In arts & entertainment, AEPi alumni include Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry, Academy Award and Emmy Award- winner James L. Brooks, both members of Simon & Garfunkel, singer/rapper Hoodie Allen, actor Gene Wilder, as well as co-creator of American Dad! Matt Weitzman, and Family Guy writer Neil Goldman. The fraternity also counts 3 Nobel Prize-winners among its alumni. List of chapters and alumni clubs The fraternity currently has 186 active chapters and colonies in eleven of the fourteen Big Ten Conference schools, seven of eight Ivy League schools, and eight of the ten University of California campuses. It is also the largest international fraternity in Canada, California, New York, and Massachusetts. The fraternity established the Aleph chapter in Israel during the spring of 2009, located in the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. It has since expanded to other universities in Israel. In 2011, the fraternity expanded to the United Kingdom, establishing a colony at St Andrews in the spring, followed by Birmingham and Leeds in the fall. there are 5 active chapters and 4 active colonies in the UK; St Andrews, Leeds, Birmingham, Nottingham, London, Manchester, Warwick, Liverpool and Bristol. In 2012, the first colony in France was created for the Paris area. AEPi has a colony at the Lauder Business School in Austria. In 2016, AEPi formed a colony in Australia. The fraternity also has 24 active alumni clubs in several major cities.

He is most noted for his explorations of permafrost phenomena in the western Canadian Arctic. His 40 plus years of study has enabled the building of pipeline operations and petroleum explorations in areas of frozen ground. The Royal Society of Canada stated the following when Mackay was awarded the Willet G. Miller Medal in 1975: :As a research worker with a superb talent of combining three elements - theory, design of simple but effective instruments, and skilled and careful field observations - he has met the challenges of applied science. In the field of permafrost studies he has attained a stature equal to the best from the USA and USSR and in so doing has enhanced Canadian science. Early life Mackay was born in Formosa (Taiwan) (then under Japanese rule) to George William Mackay and Jean Ross Mackay, as well as brother to siblings Leslie, Anna, Margaret and Isabel Minnie (1917-2012). His grandfather was George Leslie Mackay, who was instrumental in bringing Christianity and public health care to Northern Taiwan (Formosa). The Mackay Memorial Hospital was named after his ancestor. Mackay completed a B.A. at Clark University in 1939. He obtained an M.A. from Boston University in 1941. That same year he left his studies to join the war effort. Mackay enlisted in the Canadian Army. Mackay completed training near Toronto and further training as a private (gunner) at a large artillery camp in Petawawa, on the Ottawa River. He was commissioned an Officer (Lieutenant) by 1942. Before the Second World War ended he attained the rank of Major in the Canadian Intelligence Corps. He was stationed in Ottawa until he was discharged in 1946. Career In September 1946 Mackay joined McGill University's Department of Geography as an Assistant Professor. His first paper on \\"The North Shore of the Ottawa River, Quyon to Montebello, Quebec\\" was published in the Revue Canadienne de Geographie, Volume 1 in 1947. In 1949 he obtained a Ph.D. from the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Later that year he accepted a position at the University of British Columbia as an Assistant Professor with the Department of Geology and Geography. In 1953 Mackay was promoted to Associate Professor and became a full Professor in 1957. Mackay gained international scientific recognition through his experimental and field investigations in geography, and especially on the topic of permafrost. He published over two hundred scientific communications, adding extensive research contributions in the Quaternary sciences. From 1981 until his death he was an Emeritus Professor at the University of British Columbia, continuing to teach (voluntarily) a graduate course and undertake field research in the western Arctic, and has published over fifty papers in refereed journals. Personal Mackay married Violet Meekins in 1944. They had two daughters, Anne and Leslie. Violet died in 1997. Ross died in Kelowna, British Columbia at the age of 98 on October 28, 2014.J.

He was the founder of Canara Bank, now one of India's leading banks, and Canara High School in Mangalore. Though he was a lawyer and a banker by profession, he was an educationist and social reformer by temperament. He helped shape the future of Dakshina Kannada District and of the GSB community in Karnataka. Early life Pai was the youngest of the four sons of Upendra Pai, a lawyer practicing in the Munsif's court at Mulki, near Mangalore. Born on 19 November 1852, at Mulki, near Mangalore, he underwent early schooling at Government High School, Mangalore, and it was the early demise of his mother that is believed to have profoundly influenced him to take to studies seriously. After passing his F.A.(First Arts examination) examination, his father sent him to Madras (now Chennai) to take up higher studies. Following his graduation (B.A.) from the Presidency College, he joined the Madras Law College and stood First Class First in Bachelor of Law (B.L) in 1875. Here he came into contact with Justice Holloway, whose personality was a rewarding experience to him. Career In 1876, following the demise of his father, he returned to Mangalore and successfully practiced law (it is said that he often attempted to persuade amicable out-of-court settlements for his clients, although this sometime cost him his fee). Pai was also an admirer of nationalist leaders of India. He held Sri Aurobinda Ghosh (later known as Sri Aurobindo) in great admiration. He was an avid reader of Aurobindo's paper 'Yugantar'. In his office room was prominently displayed a portrait of Ashwini Kumar Dutta, one of the heroes of nationalist Bengal, one word from whom could make the traders of his native town refuse to sell even a yard of cloth to European officers, including the collector of the district. Pai was a patriot at heart and a humanist by action. In 1891, four teachers, whom he had met in Madras, approached him with a proposal to start a school in Mangalore and thus was born the Canara High School, on 22 acres of land donated by A Upendra Pai, his father in Mangalore. He also firmly believed that for the social and economic uplift, education was the key.And education not confined to men only. Shortly thereafter, in 1894, with a view to encouraging the education of girls, he started the Canara Girls' High School, indeed a revolutionary step considering the prevalent values and attitude of the people towards women's education at that time. The disastrous crash of the Arbuthnot Company at the beginning of the 20th century prompted him to start, in 1906, the Canara Hindu Permanent Fund Ltd.(now Canara Bank) with a view to enabling the community to mobilise its own resources for self-help. All the three institutions namely, Canara Bank,Canara High School and Canara Girls' School started by him have grown in size and stature. Among his important contributions to the GSB (Gaud Saraswat Brahmin) community was the setting up of the ‚ÄòPoor Boys Education Fund‚Äô (which became ASRP Memorial Fund as per the decision taken at a meeting of the GSB community held in the Bhuvanendra Hall on 1st August 1909) under the aegis of Gowda Saraswath Brahman Parishad, of which he was one of the founders. He believed in creating an institution focused on social responsibilities. 'Focus on your goals and profits will follow' was his dictum. Death Throughout his life, Ammembal Subba Rao Pai suffered from a severe gout, an affliction to which he finally succumbed on 25th July 1909. Business career Concerned about the high interest rates being charged by moneylenders to the poor people of South Canara, Pai founded the Canara Hindu Permanent Fund Ltd. (now Canara Bank) on 1 July 1906, not long after the formation of Corporation Bank in the same area.

They were designed to extend Java's type system to allow \\"a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety\\".Java Programming Language The aspect compile-time type safety was not fully achieved, since it was shown in 2016 that it is not guaranteed in all cases.A ClassCastException can be thrown even in the absence of casts or nulls. The Java collections framework supports generics to specify the type of objects stored in a collection instance. In 1998, Gilad Bracha, Martin Odersky, David Stoutamire and Philip Wadler created Generic Java, an extension to the Java language to support generic types.GJ: Generic Java Generic Java was incorporated in Java with the addition of wildcards. Hierarchy and classification According to Java Language Specification:Java Language Specification, Third Edition by James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy Steele, Gilad Bracha ‚Äì Prentice Hall PTR 2005 *A type variable is an unqualified identifier. Type variables are introduced by generic class declarations, generic interface declarations, generic method declarations, and by generic constructor declarations. *A class is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the type parameters of the class. It defines one or more type variables that act as parameters. A generic class declaration defines a set of parameterized types, one for each possible invocation of the type parameter section. All of these parameterized types share the same class at runtime. *An interface is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the type parameters of the interface. It defines one or more type variables that act as parameters. A generic interface declaration defines a set of types, one for each possible invocation of the type parameter section. All parameterized types share the same interface at runtime. *A method is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the formal type parameters of the method. The form of the formal type parameter list is identical to a type parameter list of a class or interface. *A constructor can be declared as generic, independently of whether the class that the constructor is declared in is itself generic. A constructor is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the formal type parameters of the constructor. The form of the formal type parameter list is identical to a type parameter list of a generic class or interface. Motivation The following block of Java code illustrates a problem that exists when not using generics. First, it declares an \`ArrayList\` of type \`Object\`. Then, it adds a \`String\` to the \`ArrayList\`. Finally, it attempts to retrieve the added \`String\` and cast it to an \`Integer\`‚Äîan error in logic, as it is not generally possible to cast an arbitrary string to an integer. List v = new ArrayList(); v.add(\\"test\\"); // A String that cannot be cast to an Integer Integer i = (Integer)v.get(0); // Run time error Although the code is compiled without error, it throws a runtime exception (\`java.lang.ClassCastException\`) when executing the third line of code. This type of logic error can be detected during compile time by using generics and is the primary motivation for using them. The above code fragment can be rewritten using generics as follows: List v = new ArrayList(); v.add(\\"test\\"); Integer i = (Integer)v.get(0); // (type error) compilation-time error The type parameter \`String\` within the angle brackets declares the \`ArrayList\` to be constituted of \`String\` (a descendant of the \`ArrayList\`'s generic \`Object\` constituents). With generics, it is no longer necessary to cast the third line to any particular type, because the result of \`v.get(0)\` is defined as \`String\` by the code generated by the compiler. The logical flaw in the third line of this fragment will be detected as a compile-time error (with J2SE 5.0 or later) because the compiler will detect that \`v.get(0)\` returns \`String\` instead of \`Integer\`. For a more elaborate example, see reference. Here is a small excerpt from the definition of the interfaces \`List\` and \`Iterator\` in package ': public interface List { void add(E x); Iterator iterator(); } public interface Iterator { E next(); boolean hasNext(); } Type wildcards A type argument for a parameterized type is not limited to a concrete class or interface. Java allows the use of type wildcards to serve as type arguments for parameterized types. Wildcards are type arguments in the form \\"\`\`\\"; optionally with an upper or lower bound. Given that the exact type represented by a wildcard is unknown, restrictions are placed on the type of methods that may be called on an object that uses parameterized types. Here is an example where the element type of a \`Collection\` is parameterized by a wildcard: Collection c = new ArrayList(); c.add(new Object()); // compile-time error c.add(null); // allowed Since we don‚Äôt know what the element type of \`c\` stands for, we cannot add objects to it. The \`add()\` method takes arguments of type \`E\`, the element type of the \`Collection\` generic interface. When the actual type argument is \`?\`, it stands for some unknown type. Any method argument value we pass to the \`add()\` method would have to be a subtype of this unknown type. Since we don't know what type that is, we cannot pass anything in. The sole exception is null; which is a member of every type. To specify the upper bound of a type wildcard, the \`extends\` keyword is used to indicate that the type argument is a subtype of the bounding class. So \`List<? extends Number>\` means that the given list contains objects of some unknown type which extends the \`Number\` class. For example, the list could be \`List<Float>\` or \`List<Number>\`. Reading an element from the list will return a \`Number\`. Adding null elements is, again, also allowed. The use of wildcards above adds flexibility since there is not any inheritance relationship between any two parameterized types with concrete type as type argument. Neither \`List\` nor \`List\` is a subtype of the other; even though \`Integer\` is a subtype of \`Number\`. So, any method that takes \`List\` as a parameter does not accept an argument of \`List\`. If it did, it would be possible to insert a \`Number\` that is not an \`Integer\` into it; which violates type safety. Here is an example that demonstrates how type safety would be violated if \`List\` were a subtype of \`List\`: List ints = new ArrayList(); ints.add(2); List nums = ints; // valid if List were a subtype of List according to substitution rule. nums.add(3.14); Integer x = ints.get(1); // now 3.14 is assigned to an Integer variable! The solution with wildcards works because it disallows operations that would violate type safety: List nums = ints; // OK nums.add(3.14); // compile-time error nums.add(null); // allowed To specify the lower bounding class of a type wildcard, the \`super\` keyword is used. This keyword indicates that the type argument is a supertype of the bounding class. So, \`List<? super Number>\` could represent \`List<Number>\` or \`List<Object>\`. Reading from a list defined as \`List<? super Number>\` returns elements of type \`Object\`. Adding to such a list requires either elements of type \`Number\`, any subtype of \`Number\` or null (which is a member of every type). The mnemonic PECS (Producer Extends, Consumer Super) from the book Effective Java by Joshua Bloch gives an easy way to remember when to use wildcards (corresponding to covariance and contravariance) in Java. Generic class definitions Here is an example of a generic Java class, which can be used to represent individual entries (key to value mappings) in a map: public class Entry { private final KeyType key; private final ValueType value; public Entry(KeyType key, ValueType value) { this.key = key; this.value = value; } public KeyType getKey() { return key; } public ValueType getValue() { return value; } public String toString() { return \\"(\\" + key + \\", \\" + value + \\")\\"; } } This generic class could be used in the following ways, for example: Entry grade = new Entry(\\"Mike\\", \\"A\\"); Entry mark = new Entry(\\"Mike\\", 100); System.out.println(\\"grade: \\" + grade); System.out.println(\\"mark: \\" + mark); Entry prime = new Entry(13, true); if (prime.getValue()) System.out.println(prime.getKey() + \\" is prime.\\"); else System.out.println(prime.getKey() + \\" is not prime.\\"); It outputs: grade: (Mike, A) mark: (Mike, 100) 13 is prime. Diamond operator Thanks to type inference, Java SE 7 and above allow the programmer to substitute an empty pair of angle brackets (\`<>\`, called the diamond operator) for a pair of angle brackets containing the one or more type parameters that a sufficiently-close context implies.http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/type- inference-generic-instance-creation.html Thus, the above code example using \`Entry\` can be rewritten as: Entry grade = new Entry<>(\\"Mike\\", \\"A\\"); Entry mark = new Entry<>(\\"Mike\\", 100); System.out.println(\\"grade: \\" + grade); System.out.println(\\"mark: \\" + mark); Entry prime = new Entry<>(13, true); if (prime.getValue()) System.out.println(prime.getKey() + \\" is prime.\\"); else System.out.println(prime.getKey() + \\" is not prime.\\"); Generic method definitions Here is an example of a generic method using the generic class above: public static Entry twice(Type value) { return new Entry(value, value); } Note: If we remove the first \`\` in the above method, we will get compilation error (cannot find symbol 'Type') since it represents the declaration of the symbol. In many cases the user of the method need not indicate the type parameters, as they can be inferred: Entry pair = Entry.twice(\\"Hello\\"); The parameters can be explicitly added if needed: Entry pair = Entry.twice(\\"Hello\\"); The use of primitive types is not allowed, and boxed versions must be used instead: Entry pair; // Fails compilation. Use Integer instead. There is also the possibility to create generic methods based on given parameters. public Type[] toArray(Type... elements) { return elements; } In such cases you can't use primitive types either, e.g.: Integer[] array = toArray(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6); Generics in throws clause Although exceptions themselves cannot be generic, generic parameters can appear in a throws clause: public void throwMeConditional(boolean conditional, T exception) throws T { if (conditional) { throw exception; } } Problems with type erasure Generics are checked at compile-time for type- correctness. The generic type information is then removed in a process called type erasure. For example, \`List<Integer>\` will be converted to the non- generic type \`List\`, which ordinarily contains arbitrary objects. The compile- time check guarantees that the resulting code is type-correct. Because of type erasure, type parameters cannot be determined at run-time. For example, when an \`ArrayList\` is examined at runtime, there is no general way to determine whether, before type erasure, it was an \`ArrayList<Integer>\` or an \`ArrayList<Float>\`. Many people are dissatisfied with this restriction. There are partial approaches. For example, individual elements may be examined to determine the type they belong to; for example, if an \`ArrayList\` contains an \`Integer\`, that ArrayList may have been parameterized with \`Integer\` (however, it may have been parameterized with any parent of \`Integer\`, such as \`Number\` or \`Object\`). Demonstrating this point, the following code outputs \\"Equal\\": ArrayList li = new ArrayList(); ArrayList lf = new ArrayList(); if (li.getClass()  lf.getClass()) { // evaluates to true System.out.println(\\"Equal\\"); } Another effect of type erasure is that a generic class cannot extend the Throwable class in any way, directly or indirectly: public class GenericException extends Exception The reason why this is not supported is due to type erasure: try { throw new GenericException(); } catch(GenericException e) { System.err.println(\\"Integer\\"); } catch(GenericException e) { System.err.println(\\"String\\"); } Due to type erasure, the runtime will not know which catch block to execute, so this is prohibited by the compiler. Java generics differ from C++ templates. Java generics generate only one compiled version of a generic class or function regardless of the number of parameterizing types used. Furthermore, the Java run-time environment does not need to know which parameterized type is used because the type information is validated at compile-time and is not included in the compiled code. Consequently, instantiating a Java class of a parameterized type is impossible because instantiation requires a call to a constructor, which is unavailable if the type is unknown. For example, the following code cannot be compiled: T instantiateElementType(List arg) { return new T(); //causes a compile error } Because there is only one copy per generic class at runtime, static variables are shared among all the instances of the class, regardless of their type parameter. Consequently, the type parameter cannot be used in the declaration of static variables or in static methods. Project on generics Project Valhalla is an experimental project to incubate improved Java generics and language features, for future versions potentially from Java 10 onwards. Potential enhancements include: * generic specialization, e.g. List * reified generics; making actual types available at runtime.

History Formerly \\"Howard High School\\" and then \\"Howard Career Center,\\" the school is a culturally significant institution in Wilmington, Delaware. Howard High School was the first high school for African Americans in the state of Delaware. Before becoming a vo-tech school, it was subject of Gebhart v. Belton, a 1953 desegregation court case. Parents of students bused to Howard sued to allow admittance to all-white Claymont High School. Upon appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, it combined with four other cases, and thus was one of five schools subject of the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court ruling overturned \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine and ordered desegregation in all of the cases. Howard would become one of the last schools to desegregate in Delaware in 1978. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005. and It is located in the East Brandywine Historic District. Howard High School was named after Oliver Otis Howard (November 8, 1830 ‚Äì October 26, 1909) a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. He was a corps commander noted for suffering two humiliating defeats, at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, but he recovered from the setbacks while posted in the Western Theater, and served there successfully as a corps and army commander.

The album was produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Luke Ebbin. Background Guitarist Walter Schreifels, formerly of Gorilla Biscuits, formed Quicksand in 1990; the band would later become influential in the post-hardcore genre. He released two albums with the group ‚Äì Slip (1992) and Manic Compression (1995) ‚Äì before they broke up. He spent time working on CIV's debut Set Your Goals, before reuniting Quicksand in 1997, until disbanding again in 1999. Despite his peers being dropped from their respective major labels following a merger with Universal, Island Records retained Schreifels and gave him time to form a new band. Rival Schools was born out of an informal jam session with drummer Sam Siegler (formerly of Gorilla Biscuits and Youth of Today) and bassist Cache Tolman (formerly of Iceburn and CIV). They spent several months working on material and recording demos, before adding guitarist Ian Love (formerly of Burn and Die 116).Cohen 2001, p. 14 Love owned a Pro Tools studio, which aided in the group's development. They visited the UK to play first show in February 2000; Schreifels subsequently spent time managing his record label Some Records, which he would mainly use to release albums from his friends in New York. The band went on a three-week European tour in December of the same year. United by Fate was recorded with producer Luke Ebbin, mainly at Bearsville Studios in upstate New York. Further recording was at Chung King Studios, Avatar Studios and The Village Recorder. Gary Tole, who engineered the sessions, ran Pro Tools, which was edited by Graham Hawthorne. They were assisted by Jeremy Mitchell, Bill Synon, Ross Petersen and Matt Marrin. Rich Costey mixed the recordings at Village Recorder, before Steve Marcussen mastered them at Marcussen Mastering in Los Angeles. Composition United by Fate is an alternative rock, emo and post-hardcore record, which drew comparisons to Quicksand, Hundred Reasons, Foo Fighters, Burning Airlines, Mission of Burma, Wheat and Built to Spill. Schreifels' vocals earned a comparison to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and Bush vocalist Gavin Rossdale. Schreifels would write the main idea of a song and arrange the rest of it with the other members; this was a shift from Quicksand, which had Schreifels writing everything by himself. The album's title has its origin with the band's name: Schreifels went past a shop with the video game Rival Schools: United by Fate in its window, \\"[b]ut since we didn't want to get into trouble with the game's producers, we ended up calling the album \\"United By Fate\\".\\" The opening track \\"Travel by Telephone\\" begins with a metal-esque guitar riff,Knight Ridder 2001, p. 3 and recalled Fugazi. The bass guitar-driven \\"Everything Has Its Point\\" is followed by the pop rock track \\"High Acetate\\" evoked the group's New York hardcore roots and Nirvana. The main riff is played through delay and wah pedals. The slow-burning number \\"Undercovers On\\" is followed by the post-grunge track \\"Good Things\\". \\"Used for Glue\\" talks about using people and is one of the heavier-sounding tracks on the record. It initially starts with a quiet guitar part and hi-hat crashes before the full- band comes in; the heavy tone earned a comparison to Queens of the Stone Age. \\"The Switch\\" channeled the sound of the members' previous bands. \\"Holding Sand\\" was most reminiscent of Quicksand, and samples the drum beat from \\"Soon\\" by My Bloody Valentine. \\"My Echo\\" is a less-than-two minute track that uses a surf rock rhythm guitar sound: a descending chord progression and eighth note strumming in the pre-chorus. A breakdown with drum fills follows, before a guitar solo is heard. The Foo Fighters-indebted pop rock number \\"So Down On\\" is followed by the instrumental closing track \\"Hooligans for Life\\", which ends with noise rock breakdowns. Schreifels said the song was intended as a parody of 1960s pop/rock groups such as the Who and Small Faces. Siegler said the title was about \\"being youthful for life, young till I die, whatever.\\" Release In June, the group toured North America, prior to the release of a split EP with Onelinedrawing in July. They then embarked on a six-week stint from August with Burning Airlines. Originally scheduled for release in late July,Shaulis 2001, p. B8 and pushed back to mid-August, United by Fate was eventually released on September 4 through Island Records. The CD label featured a tomato dog toy that was owned by Love. To aid in promotion, the label gave away a sampler that featured two of the album's tracks, combined with two outtakes, with purchases of a Weezer single. Alongside this, the label provided music websites a music player that included streams of some of the record's songs with live videos and photos. Following the album's release, the group went on a December US tour. In January 2002, the band went on a US tour with Taking Back Sunday, followed by a European tour in February and March. \\"Used for Glue\\" was released as a single on March 18. The UK CD featured \\"Bells\\", \\"On Vacation\\" and the music video for \\"Used for Glue\\", while the European CD swapped the video for \\"Grunge Model\\". The 7\\" vinyl version included \\"The Sweet\\" as the B-side. \\"Travel by Telephone\\" was released as a single on May 21. In June, the band went on another European tour where they played various festivals, leading up to an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. Following this, they embarked on a UK tour, which included performances at the Move, Distortion, and Reading and Leeds Festivals. To coincide with this, \\"Good Things\\" was released as a single on July 8. Two CD versions were release: one featuring Steve Lamacq radio sessions versions of \\"High Acetate\\" and \\"Undercovers On\\" with the music video for \\"Good Things\\", while the other featured Lamacq session versions of \\"Used for Glue\\" and \\"Good Things\\". On December 13, Love announced his departure from the group, choosing to focus on his side project Cardia. On January 12, 2003, Chris Traynor of Bush was announced as their new guitarist. United by Fate was re-pressed on vinyl through independent label SRC Vinyl. It featured the bonus tracks \\"The Sweet\\", \\"Get Centered\\", \\"Grunge Model\\", \\"Accept a Compliment\\" and \\"On Vacation\\". Coinciding with its November 2013 release, the band supported Jimmy Eat World on their European tour. Reception \\"Used for Glue\\" and \\"Good Things\\" were released as singles, which charted at #42 and #74, respectively, on the UK Singles Chart. By March 2011, it had sold 38,000 copies in the US.Wood 2011, p. 31 It has since been seen as a landmark for the post-hardcore genre and become a cult classic. United by Fate has appeared on best-of emo album lists by Drowned in Sound and NME. Similarly, Drowned in Sound included it at number 44 on their list of the best albums released in that publication's lifetime.

One of the main factors in differentiating toxic anterior segment syndrome from an infectious endophthalmitis is the rapid onset. Most patients with toxic anterior segment syndrome will develop symptoms within 12 to 24 hours of the surgery. Common findings on anterior segment slit lamp examination include increased cell and flare with associated fibrin and possible hypopyon formation. Patients may show signs of diffuse corneal edema, and they may also show signs of iris atrophy with pupillary abnormalities and eventual increased intraocular pressure. It is important to differentiate sterile postoperative inflammation from infectious endophthalmitis because the treatments of these patients are markedly different. Patients with toxic anterior segment syndrome will often respond rapidly to treatment with topical corticosteroids, while infectious endophthalmitis must be treated with antibiotics. It is important that the patients be evaluated often to ensure that the inflammation is clearing and that the patient's intraocular pressure is under control. The clearing of the inflammation and eventual patient outcome is related to the severity of the toxic insult at the time of surgery. Most patients reported to date are in the category of a moderate toxic inflammation. Toxic anterior segment syndrome may be related to problems with any irrigating solution or other solution placed in the patient's eye during surgery, including balanced salt solution or anything added to solutions. Material placed in the eye during surgery such as anesthetics, ophthalmic viscoelastic devices, antibiotics, or other medications has been associated with toxic anterior segment syndrome. Problems related to the cleaning and sterilization of instruments for cataract surgery have been found to be a cause.

It is organized by the Novi Sad Cultural Centre. The festival was first held in 1999 in the Novi Sad Cultural Centre. Over the years, the festival has grown, and as of 2004, the festival was moved to the Serbian National Theatre. History The first jazz festival was held in the Cultural Centre of Novi Sad, from November 25 to November 27, 1999. It was quite modest, with a majority of jazz performers coming from the \\"Third Yugoslavia\\", of which Novi Sad was a part, at the time. In 2000, the second festival was held over three days, from November 23 until November 25. In 2001, the organizers added workshops and exhibitions to the festival. In 2003, the festival was held over five days, but the organizers were forced to change its location, due to the popularity of the festival. Since 2004, the festival has been held in Novi Sad's Serbian National Theatre. Performers Over the past seven years, the main concert programme has featured ensembles and musicians from many European countries, the United States, as well as other parts of the world.

One of radio's first talk shows, it began as a six- week experiment, and NBC itself didn't expect much from it. Broadcast live from New York City's Town Hall, America's Town Meeting of the Air debuted on Thursday May 30, 1935, and only 18 of NBC's affiliates carried it.\\"George V. Denny, Radio Host, Dead.\\" New York Times, November 12, 1959, p. 35. The topic for that first show was \\"Which Way America: Fascism, Communism, Socialism or Democracy?‚ÄùOverstreet, Harry A. and Bonaro W. Overstreet. Town Meeting Comes to Town. Harper and Brothers, 1938. The moderator was George V. Denny, Jr., executive director of the League for Political Education, which produced the program. Denny moderated the program from 1935 to 1952 and had a major role in choosing weekly topics. Denny and the League wanted to create a program that would replicate the Town Meetings that were held in the early days of the United States.\\"Boston Symphony Returns to the Air; Town Meetings to Be Resumed as Public Forum.\\" New York Times, November 1, 1936, Section X, p. 13. Current events and issues The show's introduction tried to evoke the old town meetings, as the voice of the mythical town crier announced, ‚ÄúTown meeting tonight! Come to the old Town Hall and talk it over!‚Äù Denny and the League believed that a radio town meeting could enhance the public's interest in current events. Denny worried that an uninformed public was bad for democracy;Overstreet, p. 6 and he believed society had become so polarized that the average person didn't listen to other points of view.Hilmes, Michele, editor. \\"NBC: America's Network.\\" University of California Press, 2007, pp. 46-47. His goal was to create a new kind of educational program, one that would be entertaining as well as mentally challenging, while exposing listeners to various perspectives on the issues of the day. Explaining the rationale behind a radio town meeting, Denny wrote that it was \\"... a device which is designed to attract [the average American's] attention and stimulate his interest in the complex economic, social and political problems which he must have a hand in solving.\\"Denny, George V. Jr. \\"Radio Builds Democracy.\\" Journal of Educational Sociology, vol. 14, #6, February 1941, p. 377. Audience participation On paper, America's Town Meeting looked like a typical panel discussion, with high-profile celebrity guests, who were experts on a particular current issue. For example, on a December 19, 1935, show about Social Security, one of the panelists was U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, who explained and defended the new government program. (What she said about it can be heard here.) But while many shows had well-known experts, few had the kind of audience participation that this one did.Denny, p. 373. They cheered or applauded when they liked what a speaker said, and they hissed or booed when they felt the speaker was wrong. They also heckled: part of the format of the show was to allow members of the audience to ask questions, and while the rule was the question had to be brief‚Äîabout 25-30 words maximum, with no insults or name-calling,Overstreet, p. 40 that didn't stop people from using sarcasm, or strongly disagreeing with what a guest had said.Sparling, Earl. \\"Town Meeting's On the Air Again.\\" Forum and Century, October 1939, pp. ;164‚Äì165.. Even the listeners at home could take part: while at first there was no easy way to get callers on the air, by 1936, NBC engineers had designed a method for letting listeners call in from remote locations where they had gathered to listen to the show. Educational uses The show succeeded beyond NBC's expectations, and the six-week trial became permanent. As Denny had hoped, listeners not only enjoyed hearing famous newsmakers engaging in discussion but they also enjoyed hearing members of the audience challenging these newsmakers. It wasn't long before Denny was receiving fan mail: His first broadcast received about 3,000 letters, much to his surprise. By the 1937‚Äì8 season, mail averaged between 2,000 and 4,000 letters a week, an amazing number for an educational program.Hilmes, p. 49. It also inspired listeners to form \\"listener clubs,\\" where members would listen as a group and then discuss the topic themselves.Sparling, p. 166. America's Town Meeting became so popular in the public discourse that during the late 1930s and into the early 40s, Denny wrote a monthly column for Current History magazine, in which he gave summaries of the major points made by some of his Town Meeting guests, and then gave readers news quizzes. And educators found it so useful that Denny and NBC put program listings and what the speakers had said into booklet form, which was disseminated to public school civics teachers. Guests Over the years, America's Town Meeting became known for its interesting guests, many of whom were important newsmakers. Denny did not shy away from controversy: his panelists included Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas, American Communist Party leader Earl Browder, and civil libertarian Morris Ernst. But there were also guests from the world of literature (author Pearl Buck, poets Carl Sandburg and Langston Hughes) and a number of famous scientists, politicians, journalists, and public intellectuals.Sparling, p. 165. Topics AdvertisementAlbert Lea Evening Tribune, February 13, 1947, 7:7-8 promoting a broadcast of the Town Meeting of the Air. Note that the program is billed as on the \\"Blue Network\\", 20 months after the Blue Network was officially renamed ABC Radio. The topics were meant to inspire discussion, and Denny tried to select subjects that would get people talking long after the show was over. Among them were discussions about whether America truly had freedom of the press (and whether censorship was sometimes necessary); whether the United States should enter World War II or remain neutral; and why the United States public schools weren't doing a better job.\\"Schools Are Urged to Teach Politics.\\" New York Times, February 7, 1936, p. 5.Hilmes, p. 51. But during World War II, Denny repeatedly encountered what he had most sought to avoid: angry audience members who didn't want to listen to other viewpoints and who wanted to criticize, rather than debate. Worse still, some audience members expressed isolationist and anti-Semitic views. Denny struggled to maintain the show's openness and objectivity, but it became increasingly difficult to do so.Hilmes, pp. 51-52. Decline The 1930s were definitely the heyday of America's Town Meeting, although it remained on the air throughout the 1940s and sometimes still inspired the kinds of passionate discussions Denny had hoped for. But Town Meeting underwent a number of time changes during the 1940s. Some were the result of changes at NBC ‚Äî the network that had been called the NBC Blue Network was sold in 1943, and it first became known as the \\"Blue Network,\\" and then was renamed the American Broadcasting Company in late 1945. (Some advertisements and promotions for \\"Town Meeting,\\" however, would still refer to the show as \\"a Blue Network program\\" or originating on \\"ABC's Blue Network\\" as late as 1949.) Some of the programs on the new network were shifted around, and not only did Town Meeting get a new timeslot‚Äîit was moved from 9:30pm to 8:30pm‚Äîbut by 1944, it even got a sponsor‚ÄîReader's Digest. At times, the show was 60 minutes, sometimes 45 minutes and sometimes only a half-hour. And when television came along, interest in Denny's radio program gradually faded. By 1952, he had been replaced as moderator, and the show was finally canceled on July 1, 1956. Denny, who continued to believe in educational media, joined an organization that planned international seminars, and he hoped to create an international version of Town Meeting. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on November 11, 1959, at the age of 60.  Awards and honors  ABC Radio and George V. Denny, Jr. were given a 1945 Peabody Award for Outstanding Educational Program for America's Town Meeting of the Air. In 2009, the National Recording Preservation Board selected the May 8, 1941, episode of America's Town Meeting of the Air (\\"Should Our Ships Convoy Materials to England?\\" with guests Reinhold Niebuhr and John Flynn) for inclusion in the holdings of the National Archives' audiovisual collection.Registry Choices 2009: The National Recording Preservation Board (Library of Congress).

Known for blending Orthodox Jewish themes with reggae, rock and hip hop beatboxing sounds, Matisyahu's 2005 single \\"King Without a Crown\\" was a Top 40 hit in the United States. Since 2004, he has released five studio albums as well as two live albums, two remix CDs and two DVDs featuring live concerts. In addition, Matisyahu played the role of Tzadok in The Possession, a supernatural horror film directed by Ole Bornedal and co-produced by Sam Raimi. Through his career, Matisyahu has worked with Bill Laswell, reggae producers Sly & Robbie, and Kool Kojak. Biography =Early life= Matthew Paul Miller was born on June 30, 1979, in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His family eventually settled in White Plains, New York. He was brought up a Reconstructionist Jew, and attended Hebrew school at Bet Am Shalom, a synagogue in White Plains. He spent much of his childhood learning the tenets of Judaism, but by the time he was a teenager, Matisyahu began to rebel against his rigid upbringing. He started taking drugs and dropped out of White Plains Senior High School. He became a self-professed \\"Phish-head\\" (also known as Phish \\"Phans\\"),https://www.vulture.com/2012/10/25-most-devoted-fans.html taking hallucinogens, and following the rock band Phish on tour. In autumn 1995, Matisyahu attended a two-month program at the Alexander Muss High School in Hod Hasharon, Israel. The program offers students first-hand exploration of Jewish heritage as a way of solidifying Jewish identity. After he finished Muss, he returned to New York, where he subsequently left high school after the first day of his senior year to travel throughout the US. A stint in a rehabilitation center in upstate New York followed. Miller then attended a wilderness expedition trip in Oregon for teenagers. \\"It was not necessarily for drug rehabilitation, but that was part of the reason I was out there,\\" he explained to a journalist of The Jewish Daily Forward in 2008. He finished high school at a wilderness program in Bend, Oregon. In Oregon, he identified himself as \\"Matt, the Jewish rapper kid from New York.\\" Matisyahu has contrasted this time in Oregon to his life in New York City. \\"I was suddenly the token Jew. This was now my search for my own identity, and part of Judaism feeling more important and relevant to me.\\" He returned to New York and started developing his reggae, spending hours in his room, writing and practicing his style to the accompaniment of hip-hop tapes. He recounts that at the same time, he started praying, getting himself a prayer book and prayer shawl. He learned of the Orthodox Jewish Carlebach Shul synagogue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, and he began attending religious services every Sabbath, as well as wearing a yarmulke (head covering) and tzitzit (a fringed undergarment). It was then that he met NYU's Chabad rabbi, Dov Yonah Korn. Career Miller performed for over a year as MC Truth in Bend, Oregon. In 2004, after having signed with JDub Records, he released his first album, Shake Off the Dust...Arise. At Bonnaroo 2005, Trey Anastasio of the band Phish invited him for a guest spot on his set.Serpick, Evan. \\"Matisyahu: Hasidic Hot Stepper\\", Rolling Stone, February 24, 2006. He also opened for a few Dave Matthews Band shows during their Summer 2006 tour, including guesting on the song Everyday at the 06.14.2006 Darien Lake show.http://dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453056275 His next album, Live at Stubb's was produced for Or Music by Angelo Montrone. It was distributed to Or Music by Sony/RED, and later up streamed to Sony/Epic. Live at Stubb's, released in 2006, was recorded at a concert in Austin, Texas, was followed by the studio album Youth which was produced by Bill Laswell, with minor contribution by pop producers Jimmy Douglass and the Ill Factor. In 2005 and 2006, he toured extensively in the United States, Canada, and Europe; and made a number of stops in Israel, including a performance as the supporting act for Sting in June 2006. In late 2006, he released No Place to Be, a remix album featuring re-recordings and remixes of songs from all three of his earlier albums, as well as a cover of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" by The Police. The live version of the song \\"King Without a Crown\\" broke into the Modern Rock Top 10 in 2006. The accompanying video and album, Youth, produced by Bill Laswell, was released on March 7, 2006. On March 16, Youth was Billboard magazine's number-one Digital Album. In 2006, he appeared once again at Bonnaroo, this time performing a solo set. On March 1, 2006, right before the release of Youth, he informed JDub that he no longer needed its management services. He has since been represented by former Capitol Records president Gary Gersh. JDub claims the artist has three years remaining on a four-year management contract. JDub managed his act, but was not his record label.Sisario, Ben. \\"Hasidic Reggae Singer Surprises His Managers\\" , The New York Times, March 14, 2006. Since his debut, Matisyahu has received positive reviews from both rock and reggae outlets. In 2006, he was named as Top Reggae Artist by Billboard as well as being named a spokesperson for Kenneth Cole. In 2006, Esquire magazine awarded Matisyahu the \\"Most Lovable Oddball\\" award in their \\"Esky\\" Music Awards, calling him \\"the most intriguing reggae artist in the world.\\" At the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, the film Unsettled, in which Matisyahu appears, won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature. While attending the festival, he performed in an impromptu concert at the Park City Film Music Festival in Park City, Utah. In the summer of 2007 he joined 311 on their Summer Unity Tour. He also performed in the 2008 documentary Call + Response. His third studio album, Light, was released on August 25, 2009, along with the live EP Live at Twist & Shout. Around 2008-2009, he also began his longstanding collaboration with members of the Duo Trio.Greenhaus, Mike https://jambands.com/features/2011/01/27/matisyahu-man-in-motion/ Jambands.com From July 10‚Äì30, 2010, Matisyahu (along with The Dirty Heads) supported Sublime with Rome (the new version of the band) on their US tour. In November 2009, NBC used Matisyahu's song \\"One Day\\" as background music for their advertisement of the Olympic games. This stirred up speculation that \\"One Day\\" might become the theme song for the 2010 Olympics. However, it remained only NBC's top pick, and was not announced to be the theme song. On August 2, 2010, Matisyahu revealed to OC Weekly that he has been writing new songs for his next album, which was expected to be recorded within weeks of his statement. On November 3, 2010, he performed his music accompanied by a single acoustic guitarist, recited poetry and answered questions at the University of Central Florida. On November 26, 2010, Matisyahu released \\"Two\\", a special edition Record Store Day Black Friday 7\\" vinyl record, for independent record stores.

On June 3, 2014, Matisyahu released Akeda, which is slightly different from his previous work. Matisyahu himself described it as a \\"stripped back sound\\" and in a style as he describes as \\"less is more.\\" Akeda was in the iTunes Top 10 a week later, ranking at No. 6 which was the same week he began his new tour. The tour started at Kakaako Waterfront Park in Honolulu, Hawaii, as part of the Repulik Music Festival 4. On August 17, 2015, the Rototom Sunsplash festival in Spain canceled Matisyahu's scheduled appearance, at the request of the BDS Movement, due to his refusing to sign a letter stating he supports a Palestinian state, and would not bring up Israeli politics on stage. This led to many organizations around the world criticizing the organization of showing racism toward Jews. Two days later the Spanish government condemned the decision to cancel his appearance. On August 19, the festival apologized to Matisyahu and re-invited him to perform as original scheduled, following outrage around the world. The organizers released a statement saying they \\"made a mistake, due to the boycott and the campaign of pressure, coercion and threats employed by the BDS.\\" Matisyahu's performance went through peacefully with some Palestinian flags waved by the audience, however Matisyahu later said the racism he experienced was worse than anything else before. On October 10, 2015, Matisyahu performed in Israel at the Sultan's Pool in Jerusalem against the backdrop of escalating stabbing attacks in the city. Matisyahu stated that it is important for \\"American Jews like [him]self to come to Israel no matter what's happening here.\\" Jerusalem's mayor, Nir Barkat, thanked Matisyahu and spoke before the performance and said that \\"Everyone who came here today and is maintaining their regular routine is a partner in fighting terror.\\" Before singing \\"Jerusalem (Out of Darkness Comes Light)\\" (his ode to the city), Matisyahu said, \\"Jerusalem, I‚Äôm home.\\" In 2016, Matisyahu went on a tour of 12 US college campuses as a response to being disinvited from the Rototom Sunsplash festival in 2015. The tour was co- sponsored by various Hillel chapters. On November 18, 2016, Matisyahu released Release the Bound, a five-song digital EP featuring brand new music. The EP includes collaborative efforts with relative mainstay Stu Brooks as well as The Polish Ambassador and Salt Cathedral. Matisyahu released his sixth studio album, Undercurrent on May 19, 2017.

Matisyahu is featured on the Common Kings 2018 EP \\"One Day\\" for the song \\"Broken Crowns\\". Artistry = Musical style = Matisyahu performance in 2005 Matisyahu fuses the African- influenced styles of reggae, rap, beatboxing, and hip-hop with vocal disciplines of jazz's scat singing and Judaism's hazzan style of songful prayer. The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh wrote that \\"His sound owes a lot to early dancehall reggae stars like Barrington Levy and Eek-a-Mouse.\\" The Chicago Tribune's Kevin Pang described a Matisyahu performance as \\"soul- shaking brand of dancehall reggae, a show that captures both the jam band vibe of Phish and the ska-punk of Sublime.\\" Coming from his Jewish beliefs and compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu's lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of Hebrew and Yiddish. In 2006, Matisyahu stated that \\"All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me. I want my music to have meaning, to be able to touch people and make them think. Chassidus teaches that music is 'the quill of the soul.' Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't.\\" In 2009, he said about his recently released album Light, \\"I think the vast majority of people that respect what I do are willing to move with me. I think it's not so much about genres or styles of music as it is about expressing the emotion or the idea. ... Whatever allows you to do that, whatever style, as long as it's authentic.\\" However, he has been criticized for cultural appropriation of Rastafarian, Jamaican and African American musical styles and imagery.  Personal life  = Family = Matisyahu met NYU film student Tahlia (n√©e Silverman) when she interviewed him for a documentary about men and women not touching each other. They were set up by Rabbi Dov Yonah Korn, NYU's Chabad chaplain,They were set up by Rabbi Korn ('You have to set up a date through the rabbi') and went through a dating process that Matisyahu admits would make a great premise for a sitcom. 'After the date she called the rabbi and told him what happened, and I called the rabbi and told him what happened. Then we decided if we wanted to go another date. By the third date, I knew this was the person I wanted to marry.' and they married in August 2004. Together they have sons Laivy (2005), Shalom, and Menachem Mendel (2011).December 11, 2011 episode of 'Chef Roble & Co' where he catered a Kosher Vegan Event for Matisyahu In 2014, Matisyahu confirmed that he had divorced his wife approximately two years before, but they remain on good terms and were sharing parenting responsibilities.

Former girlfriend Toma Danley gave birth to Sasha on April 2, 2014 in Portland, Oregon where the newborn was diagnosed with a rare heart defect. Sasha underwent open-heart surgery in May 2015, and another in January 2017. She has reportedly recovered well. Sasha has lived with Danley since their daughter's birth.

Matisyahu and Talia were married at a private wedding ceremony, held in Matisyahu's backyard, on May 19, 2019 They have one daughter, Esti River, born on March 20th 2020. = Religion = From 2001 through July 2007, Matisyahu was affiliated with the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York, whose rabbi officiated at his wedding in 2004. Soon after his adoption of Hasidism, Matisyahu began studying Torah at Hadar Hatorah, a yeshiva for returnees to Judaism where he wrote and recorded his first album. He counts Bob Marley, Phish,Rolling Stone. 'New CDs: Matisyahu, Juvenile, by Peter Relic. March 6, 2006 God Street Wine and Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach among his musical inspirations and gives credit to Rabbi Simon Jacobson's book Toward a Meaningful Life for the lyrical inspiration to Youth's title track. As part of his faith, he strictly observed the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown on Friday; thus he did not perform in concert on Friday nights. An exception to this rule occurred at a 2007 concert in Fairbanks, Alaska; since the sun did not set until 2:00 a.m., performing in the late hours was not a violation of Jewish observance. However, as of July 17, 2007, he told the Miami New Times in an interview that he no longer \\"necessarily\\" identifies with the Lubavitch movement. In the interview he stated that \\"...the more I'm learning about other types of Jews, I don't want to exclude myself. I felt boxed in.\\" Additionally, in the fall of 2007, while on a family vacation spent primarily in Jerusalem's Nachlaot neighborhood, he expressed interest in another Hasidic group, that of Karlin. As of November 2007 he had confirmed a preference to pray at the Karliner synagogue in Borough Park, Brooklyn where the custom is to ecstatically scream prayers; however he continued to reside in Crown Heights because of his wife's affinity for the community.Nussbaum Cohen, Debra. \\"Matisyahu's New Spiritual Groove\\". The Jewish Week, November 28, 2007. On December 13, 2011, Matisyahu posted a beardless picture of himself on Twitter, explaining on his website: In June 2012, Matisyahu appeared in an online video to promote his new single \\"Sunshine\\" with his hair bleached and apparently without a yarmulke, causing a big stir within the Jewish blogosphere. = Origin of his name = Matisyahu is an Ashkenazic Hebrew pronunciation of a Biblical Hebrew name (◊û◊™◊™◊ô◊î◊ï ‚Äì Mattithyahu; Israeli Hebrew pronunciation: Matityahu); Greek: Mattathias/ Matthaios, meaning \\"Gift of God\\"), the name of the 2nd-century BC Jewish leader of the Maccabees' revolt. In an interview in Kosher Spirit Magazine (a publication by OK Kosher Certification), Matisyahu explained the origin of his use of the name as follows: while he, like most Jewish boys, received a Hebrew name at his brit milah (circumcision ceremony), when he was eight days old, Miller's family lost track of the names given. In Hebrew school, it was assumed to be Matisyahu because of the connection between Matthew and Matisyahu. The original certificate of bris was later located and Miller discovered that the actual name given at the bris was the Yiddish name \\"Feivish Hershel\\". He was advised by his rabbis to continue using the Hebrew name that he had grown up with. =Veganism = Matisyahu is a vegan and a board member of the Jewish vegan organization, the Shamayim V'Aretz Institute.

It is associated with a variety of dermatological conditions caused by fungal infections, notably seborrhoeic dermatitis and tinea versicolor. As an opportunistic pathogen, it has further been associated with dandruff, pityriasis versicolor, and tinea circinata, as well as catheter-related fungemia and pneumonia in patients receiving hematopoietic transplants. The fungus can also affect other animals, including dogs.  Background  Malassezia furfur is a fungus that lives on the superficial layers of the dermis. It generally exists as a commensal organism forming a natural part of the human skin microbiota, but it can gain pathogenic capabilities when morphing from a yeast to a hyphal form during its life cycle, through unknown molecular changes. This can lead to its uncontrolled proliferation and a subsequent imbalance of the residential skin flora. Some virulence factors or properties which may increase the fungus' ability to acquire an infectious nature include the formation of biofilms, increased adherence to surfaces, and hydrophobicity. Infections with pathogenic M. furfur occur on the trunk or the limbs and present clinically as pigmented macules that can merge in the form of scaling plaques. Many of these lesions resolve spontaneously in most patients. The pathogen most frequently affects children compared to people of other age groups. It has been associated with numerous dermatological conditions, including seborrhoeic dermatitis, dandruff, pityriasis versicolor, and tinea circinata, all of which affect the skin. Some other diseases can also arise due to an infection with the fungus, such as catheter-related fungemia and pneumonia in patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplants.  Morphology and characteristics  Malassezia furfur is a unicellular organism which varies in size between 1.5‚Äì4.5 √ó 2.0‚Äì6.5 micrometers. The cells have a bottle-like shape due to a small protrusion visible at the end of each cell. Cells are difficult to grow in a lab since they require specific conditions.  Treatment  Topical application of antifungal medications such as azole antimycotics, ciclopirox olamine, piroctone-olamine, zinc pyrithione, or sulfur compounds are commonly prescribed to treat diseases caused by Malassezia furfur.

Like other AES candidates, DFC operates on blocks of 128 bits, using a key of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It uses an 8-round Feistel network. The round function uses a single 6√ó32-bit S-box, as well as an affine transformation mod 264+13. DFC can actually use a key of any size up to 256 bits; the key schedule uses another 4-round Feistel network to generate a 1024-bit \\"expanded key\\". The arbitrary constants, including all entries of the S-box, are derived using the binary expansion of e as a source of \\"nothing up my sleeve numbers\\". Soon after DFC's publication, Ian Harvey raised the concern that reduction modulo a 65-bit number was beyond the native capabilities of most platforms, and that careful implementation would be required to protect against side-channel attacks, especially timing attacks. Although DFC was designed using Vaudenay's decorrelation theory to be provably secure against ordinary differential and linear cryptanalysis, in 1999 Lars Knudsen and Vincent Rijmen presented a differential chosen-ciphertext attack that breaks 6 rounds faster than exhaustive search. In 2000, Vaudenay, et al. presented an updated version of the algorithm, called DFCv2. This variant allows for more choice in the cipher's parameters, and uses a modified key schedule to eliminate certain weak keys discovered by Don Coppersmith.

It was devised to replace the mallets that were traditionally used to play the cymbalum. Unlike mallets, which almost exclusively are used for striking, the bowhammer allows for greater versatility, \\"expanding the sonic and expressive scope of an ancient instrument.\\" It consists of a ring, which holds the bowhammer on the finger, a shaped handle attached to the ring, and a 3 inch section of violin bow at the end. Bowhammers are typically worn in groups of eight, one on each finger except the thumb. The tension on the bow allows the player to stroke the string or strike it. Additionally the string can be plucked it with the end of the bowhammer. The bowhammer is a recent musical invention created by the musician Michael Masley, who is the premiere user of this tool. The sound generated is significantly different from that generated by the traditional hammering of the cymbalom, that the artist considers the bowhammer cymbalom a specific instrument. The bowhammer may be usable on other string instruments, such as the guitar or hammered dulcimer, but no other uses have surfaced to date.

Comparison of brush discharge (left) and corona discharges (right) from a Tesla coil Closeup of a Tesla coil brush discharge, showing its filamentous nature A brush discharge is an electrical disruptive discharge similar to a corona discharge that takes place at an electrode with a high voltage applied to it, embedded in a nonconducting fluid, usually air. It is characterized by multiple luminous writhing sparks, plasma streamers composed of ionized air molecules, which repeatedly strike out from the electrode into the air, often with a crackling sound. The streamers spread out in a fan shape, giving it the appearance of a \\"brush\\". Corona and brush discharges are sometimes called one-electrode discharges because they occur in the vicinity of a single electrode, and don't extend as far as the electrode carrying opposite polarity voltage in the circuit, as an electric arc (a two-electrode discharge) does. *Corona discharge ‚Äî occurs at sharp points and edges (radius < 1 mm). It is a uniform ionization (glow discharge) visible as a dim stationary blue glow, fading out as it extends from the conductor. *Brush discharge ‚Äî occurs at a curved electrode (radius between 5 and 50 mm) in the vicinity of a flat electrode. It consists of a short ionization channel which breaks up into a fan of multiple moving streamers which strike toward the other electrode. If the electrode is too sharp, a corona discharge will usually occur instead of a brush discharge. *Arc or spark discharge ‚Äî A \\"two electrode\\" discharge that occurs when an ionized channel extends all the way from one electrode to the other. This allows a large current to flow, releasing a large amount of energy. Both brush and corona discharges represent regions next to conductors where the air has ionized and become conductive, allowing current to leak into the air. They occur when the electric field at the conductor exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, the \\"disruptive potential gradient\\", roughly 30 kilovolts per centimeter. At that voltage, electrons in the air are accelerated by the electric field to a high enough velocity that they knock other electrons off gas molecules when they hit them, creating ions and additional electrons, which go on to ionize additional molecules in a chain reaction. The electric field is highest at sharp points on the conductor, so discharges tend to form at these points. Because the electric field decreases as the distance from the conductor increases, it eventually drops below the value needed for ionization, so corona and brush discharges have a limited extent and are localized near the conductor. Like other electric arcs, brush discharges produce ozone gas, which can be noxious to nearby people in an enclosed space and over time can cause embrittlement of some plastics. The ability of an electrical discharge to cause an explosion in flammable atmospheres is measured by the effective energy of the discharge. The effective energy of brush discharges is 10-20 mJ, much larger than that of corona discharges 0.1 mJ. Therefore, brush discharges are considered an explosion hazard, while corona discharges are not. Brush discharges can occur from charged insulating plastics (for example polythene) to a conductor.

After two years, he was promoted to the position of offensive coordinator. He then returned to FSU, his alma mater, for a season as a graduate assistant coach. In 1987, he began a four-year stint as offensive coordinator at Samford University, again under big brother and head coach Terry Bowden. Bowden then moved up to the Division I-A level as wide receivers coach at Southern Mississippi for three years before being hired by his father at Florida State in 1994 as wide receivers coach. He was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2001 when Mark Richt departed for the head coaching position at Georgia. Jeff Bowden's choice as offensive coordinator was often criticized as nepotism (Bowden has worked for his father or brother in 31 of his 34 years as a football coach). The offense struggled during the younger Bowden's career and after years of frustration the Noles were shut out at home by Wake Forest. Days later, a deal was struck for Jeff Bowden to step down.

The majority of cases are associated with feline flea allergy dermatitis. Clinical Signs Cats with miliary dermatitis have a rash consisting of fine papules surmounted by small crusts. Although most are unaffected by rash, where noticed a broad rash can be concentrated to the back of the neck, scapular (shoulder blade) and surrounding areas, and/or the lower abdomen and surrounding areas. Secondary infection with Staphylococcus intermedius is common. Signs include itchiness, \\"elevated grooming\\", and visible spots of fur-loss.

It is also one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. It is one of the 274 Paadal Petra Sthalams, where the three of the most revered Nayanars (Saivite saints), Appar, Sundarar and Tirugnana Sambandar, have glorified the temple with their songs. The temple was expanded during the 12th century by Pandya Dynasty, and its principal shrines sanctum were renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan of the Jaffna kingdom. The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India. The temple is located in Rameswaram considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Smarthas. The presiding deity, the Lingam of Ramanathaswamy (Shiva), was established and worshiped by Rama before crossing his bridge to Lanka. Legend According to the Ramayana, Rama, the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to the god Shiva to absolve him of the sin committed during his war against the king Ravana in Sri Lanka.Jones 2007, p. 359Harshananda 2012, p. 115 Rama wanted to have a large lingam to worship Shiva. He directed Hanuman, the lieutenant in his army, to bring a lingam from the Himalayas. When Hanuman was delayed in bringing the lingam, rama built a small lingam out of the sand available in the seashore, which is believed to be the lingam in the sanctum. Architecture Image of the east and west temple towers The primary deity of the temple is Ramanathaswamy (Shiva) in the form of lingam. There are two lingams inside the sanctum - one built by Rama, from sand, residing as the main deity, Ramalingam and the one brought by Hanuman from Kailash called Vishwalingam.Singh 2009, p. 18 Rama instructed that the Vishwalingam should be worshipped first since it was brought by Hanuman - the tradition continues even today. Like all ancient temples in South India, there is a high compound wall (madil) on all four sides of the temple premises measuring about 865 feet furlong from east to west and one furlong of 657 feet from north to south with huge towers (Gopurams) to the east and the west and finished gate towers to the north and south. The temple has striking long corridors in its interior, running between huge colonnades on platforms above five feet high.Cole 1885, pp. clxvi-clxvii The second corridor is formed by sandstone pillars, beams, and ceiling. The junction of the third corridor on the west and the paved way leading from the western gopuram to the Setumadhava shrine forms a unique structure in the form of a chess board, popularly known as Chokkattan Madapam, where the Utsava deities are adorned and kept during the Vasanthotsavam (Spring festival) and on the 6th day festival in Adi (July‚ÄìAugust) and Masi (February‚ÄìMarch) conducted by the Setupati of Ramnad. The outer set of corridors is reputed to be the longest in the world, measuring about 6.9 m in height, 400 feet each in the east and west and about 640 feet in the north and the south. The inner corridors are about 224 feet each in the east and the west and about 352 feet each in the north and the south. Their width varies from 15.5 feet to 17 feet in the east and west about 172 feet on the north and south with width varying 14.5 feet to 17 feet.Bandopadhyay, pp. 88-89 The total length of these corridors is thus 3850 feet. There are about 1212 pillars in the outer corridor. Their height is about 30 feet from the floor to the center of the roof. The main tower or rajagopuram is 53 m tall. Most pillars are carved with individual compositions.T. 2007, p. 28 At the beginning, Ramanathaswamy Temple was a thatched shed. The present structure was the work of many individuals spread over a number of centuries. The pride of place in the establishment of the Temple goes to the Setupatis of Ramanathapuram. In the seventeenth century, Dalavai Setupati built a portion of the main eastern Gopuram. In the late eighteenth century, the world-famous third corridor was constructed by Muthuramalinga Setupati who lived for forty-nine years and ruled between 1763 and 1795. The corridor was called \\"Chokkatan Mandapam\\". The Mukhya Pradhani (Chief Minister) was Muthuirullappa Pillai and the Chinna Pradhani (Deputy Chief Minister) was Krishna Iyengar. The Setupati's statue and those of his two Pradhanis (ministers) can be seen at the western entrance to the third corridor. The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattaru, Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi. There are separate shrines for Ramanathaswamy and his consort goddess Parvathavardhini separated by a corridor. There are separate shrines for the goddess Vishalakshi, the utsava images, sayanagriha, Vishnu and Ganesha. There are various halls inside the temple, namely Anuppu Mandapam, Sukravara Mandapam, Setupati Mandapam, Kalyana Mandapam, and Nandi Mandapam. =Temple Tanks= Agni Theertham - the primary sea shore associated with the temple There are sixty-four Tƒ´rthas (holy water bodies) in and around the island of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.Murali 2000, p. 574 According to SkƒÅnda PurƒÅ·πáa, twenty-four of them are important.Setu MƒÅhƒÅtmyam, AdhyƒÅya 2, verse 104 Bathing in these Tƒ´rthas is a major aspect of the pilgrimage to Rameswaram and is considered equivalent to penance.Setu MƒÅhƒÅtmyam, AdhyƒÅya 1, verse 24 Twenty-two of the Tƒ´rthas are within the RƒÅmanƒÅthasvƒÅmƒ´ Temple.Seturaman 2001, p. 216 The number 22 indicates the 22 arrows in Rama's quiver. The first and major one is called Agni Theertham, the sea (Bay of Bengal). Significance today =Char Dham= Adi Sankara, the Guru of Advaita, who is believed to have started the Char Dhams The temple is one of the holiest Hindu Char Dham (four divine sites) sites comprising Badrinath, Puri, Dwarka and Rameshwaram .Chakravarti 1994, p. 140 Though the origins are not clearly known, the Advaita school of Hinduism established by Sankaracharya, who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.Mittal 2004, p. 482 The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram in the South. The temples are revered by the various spiritual traditions of Hinduism, such as Saivism and Vaishnavism. The Char Dham pilgrimage is an all Hindu affair.Brockman 2011, pp. 94-96 There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri - all of these lie at the foothills of Himalayas.Mittal 2004, pp. 482-3 The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to differentiate the original Char Dhams. The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime.Gwynne 2008, Section on Char Dham Traditionally the trip starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples. =Jyotirlinga= As per Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of saving) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.R. 2003, pp. 92-95 To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The jyothirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.Eck 1999, p. 107 Originally, there were believed to be 64 jyothirlingas of which 12 are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve jyothirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered a different manifestation of Shiva.Lochtefeld 2002, pp. 324-325 At all these sites, the primary image is the lingam representing the Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva (without beginning or end).Harding 1998, pp. 158-158Vivekananda Vol. 4 The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad, Maharashtra.Chaturvedi 2006, pp. 58-72 The temple is the southernmost of all the twelve Jyothirlingas. =Historical pilgrimage= The temple is one of the most famous pilgrimage sites and has several historical references about it. The Maratha kings who ruled Thanjavur established chatrams or rest houses throughout Mayiladuthurai and Rameswaram between 1745 and 1837 CE and donated them to the temple.M. 2003, p. 154 Temple contributions and donations from kings The temple in its current shape is believed to have been built during the 17th century, while Fergusson believes the small vimana in the west corridor belongs to the 11th or 12th centuries. The temple is said to have been sanctioned for construction by King Kizhavan Sethupathi or Raghunatha Kilavan. The contribution of the Jaffna kings of the Sethupathy dynasty to the temple was considerable. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan (1380 ‚Äî 1410 CE) shipped stone blocks from Koneswaram temple, Trincomalee to renovate the temple's sanctum sanctorum. Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan's successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan (Pararacacekaran V), a trustee at Rameswaram who also oversaw structural development of this temple and the promotion of Saivite beliefs donated part of his revenue to Koneswaram. Especially to be remembered are the immense sums that were spent during the tenure of Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai towards the restoration of the Pagodas which were falling into ruins and the splendid Chockattan Mantapam or the cloistered precincts of the temple at Rameswaram that he finally completed. The rulers of Sri Lanka also contributed to the temple - Parakrama Bahu (1153-1186 CE) was involved in the construction of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. In News The temple priests are Marathi Brahmins of Maharashtra who get Diksha from Sringeri Mutt. A shortage of priests has been reported in recent years as there are only five priests to manage the 13 shrines within the temple. The shortage is more pronounced during the 12-day Maha Shivaratri festival when the festival deities of the temple are taken in procession.S.P. Loganathan 2012 The temple comes under the renovation and consecration of the 630 temples planned by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.Zee News 2012 Temple authorities had planned to renovate and widen the pathways to the 22 holy theerthams of the temple. The consecration of the temple was planned during 2013. The temple is among those offering free meals under the Free Meals Scheme of the government, which provides meals to devotees of the temple. A pilgrim house is planned by the government to extend the scheme to more pilgrims.

New York: Cadence Records CLP-25030.  Title track Cadence Records founder Archie Bleyer describes the album's title track as a \\"song from Nashville, which I first heard at the Everly Brothers' home on one of my trips to that city.\\" He later conducted Williams's recording of \\"Lonely Street\\" on August 23, 1959, and the song was released as a single with another song recorded at that session, \\"Summer Love\\", as its B-side. The A-side entered the Hot 100 in Billboard magazine in the issue dated September 7 of that year and stayed on the chart for 16 weeks, peaking at number five.. In the October 26 issue it debuted on the magazine's list of 30 Hot R&B; Sides, where it lasted for four weeks and reached number 20..  The subsequent album  Once Williams had a hit with \\"Lonely Street\\", Ruhlmann suggests that, \\"in forming an album to exploit its success, he looked to the thematic ballad LPs of Frank Sinatra, such as Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely and In the Wee Small Hours.\\" The liner notes for the original release provide a bit more insight as to how the album came about. \\"Conceived during a New Orleans engagement late in 1959, the set was molded with the help of Andy's pianist, Dave Grusin, and his guitarist John Abate.\\" Ruhlmann concludes that Williams \\"didn't have the truly doom-laden style of Sinatra, but he held his own on material not really suited to his usual persona.\\" Lonely Street reached the Top LP's chart in Billboard magazine (a first for Williams) as of the issue dated January 25, 1960, and remained there for four weeks, peaking at number 38 on a list that had 40 positions at the time..

First published in 1991, it deals extensively with Sino-American female identity and draws on the story of her mother's life. The book was largely considered a commercial success, making best sellers lists in several countries worldwide. Context Amy Tan was born in Oakland, California, to Chinese immigrant parents. She has described her childhood as difficult and found it hard to fit in, not feeling she conformed to either ethnic identity. Much of Tan's work draws on the lives of her family and her work is often considered to be to some extent autobiographical. The Kitchen God's Wife's story mirrors Tan's own: the tale of Pearl, the California-born daughter of Winnie, a Chinese immigrant who fled to America to escape an abusive traditional marriage and the turmoil of war. In a 1991 interview with Katie Couric, for NBC, Tan described her connection to Pearl: > [We] are actually similar in some ways. I was a speech and language > specialist, just as Pearl was. And my father died when I was 15. But the > most striking similarity ... is our ignorance of our mothers' past. And ... > for, many, many years I didn't know anything about her life, about the > abusive marriage and the children she had lost. The Kitchen God's Wife is set largely in early 90s California and in China during World War II. San Francisco, the primary location used in the early chapters of the novel, has a significant Chinese-American population, with a significant proportion having moved during and following World War II, as Pearl's mother did, when restrictions on numbers were relaxed. The second part of the novel takes place in the lead-up to and during World War II, focusing on the lives of Chinese women under the Japanese occupation of China and the brutality inflicted on them by the occupying forces. Plot summary The novel opens with the narrative voice of Pearl Louie Brandt, the American-born daughter of a Chinese mother and a Chinese-American father, living in San Jose, California. Pearl's mother, Winnie Louie, has called her to request that she and her family come to San Francisco, to attend the engagement party of Bao-Bao, her cousin. Later, Pearl receives another call from her mother telling her that her elderly Auntie Du has died, with her funeral being arranged for the day following Bao-Bao's party. Upon her arrival in San Francisco, her Auntie Helen makes a demand: she insists that Pearl must tell Winnie that she has multiple sclerosis, something which everyone else in the family knows; Helen claims that she is suffering from a malignant brain tumor and does not want to die knowing that Winnie is unaware of her daughter's illness. Helen adds that if Pearl will not tell the truth, she will do it herself. Afterwards, Helen has a similar conversation with Winnie, telling her that she must reveal the truth of her past to Pearl. At this point the novel switches to the narrative voice of Winnie Louie, telling the story of her past. Before reaching the United States, Winnie experienced a life of turmoil and suffering: she was abandoned by her mother, a lesser wife of her father, as a young child, and did not fully understand her mother's mysterious disappearance. She was forced to live with her uncle and his two wives, never feeling as loved as her uncle's daughter, Peanut. Nevertheless, when the time came, Winnie's aunts arranged a traditional marriage for her, and her father provided a large dowry, since he was an educated and well-established man. The marriage to Wen Fu, who first courted Peanut but transferred his attentions to Winnie when he learned of her father's wealth, turned out to be a disaster. Winnie suffered physical and mental abuse at the hands of her husband, losing many children along the way. Throughout her marriage, Winnie does many things behind the scenes that her husband takes credit for, and she likens her situation to a Chinese fable about a man who was horrible to his wife no matter how much she did for him, and yet still became known as \\"the Kitchen God\\". It was during the war that Winnie met Jimmy Louie, Pearl's father; He was a good husband, a good father, and a minister in the Chinese Baptist Church, but he died when Pearl was a teenager, a time when Pearl became very angry. Winnie explains to Pearl that she met Jimmy Louie in China, at an American military dance. The two fell in love and he began to help escape her abusive marriage. In order to gain a divorce, the paper has to be signed by two witnesses and Grand Auntie Du and Helen agreed to sign. Wen-Fu had previously ripped up the papers from her first attempt, and Winnie went to him again to get the papers signed. At this second meeting Wen Fu raped her. Winnie explains that she has always tried to love Pearl more because she thought she might have been Wen-Fu's daughter. After Winnie tells her story, Pearl reveals the secret of her disease. By the time the wedding of Bao-Bao comes around, mother and daughter have come to know each other better. Winnie goes into a local shop finds an altar with an unnamed goddess. The shopkeeper gives it to her for half price because it is considered bad luck. Winnie names it \\"Lady Sorrowfree\\" the wife of the Kitchen god, who has endured all, received no credit for the work she has done, and is still strong. At the end of the novel, Helen reveals that she is planning a trip to China, with Pearl, and Winnie. Title The title is a reference to the forgotten wife of Zao Jun, or the Kitchen God, a figure whose story is similar to that of the novel's co-protagonist, Winnie. Zao Jun was once a hardworking farmer who married a virtuous and kind woman, Guo, but later squandered all their money. When his wife left him, Zao turned to begging. Chancing upon his wife whilst begging, he is wracked by guilt and throws himself into the fire as recompense. As a reward for his courage in admitting his wrongdoing, the Jade Emperor made him into a god. Tan equates Zao to Wen Fu and Winnie to the mistreated and forgotten wife. Themes The Kitchen God's Wife contains a number of themes evident in Tan's earlier novel The Joy Luck Club. A principle theme is the struggle of females in a patriarchal society. Guiyou Huang, says that \\"the novel zooms in on women's issues by exploring relationships with males ... while depicting an assiduous quest for a female divinity that represents the female subjectivity.\\" A second theme is the issues faced by immigrants and their children. Tan explores the additional strains placed on the relationship between an immigrant mother and an American-born daughter, and the consequences this has on how their lives develop. Reception The Kitchen God's Wife was published by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1991. The novel was well accepted internationally, reaching The New York Times Best Seller list in the first month of its publication, remaining there for a total of thirty eight weeks. The book went on to be included on several best sellers lists in Australia, England, Canada, Denmark, Spain and Germany. The book has been compared to works by several seminal and well known authors. The New York Times described the book as \\"remarkable ... mesmerising ... compelling ... An entire world unfolds in a Tolstoyan tide of event and detail\\", and American author Mary Ellen Snodgrass called the book a \\"Chinese Gone With the Wind\\". Some critics, such as King-Kok Cheung, have criticised Tan for her characterization of Asian men as one-sided and the \\"epitome of deception and cruelty\\". Additionally, Frank Chin has described the book's central image of the forgotten wife as invented by Tan, given that the kitchen god is a regional deity and not a major figure in Chinese mythology,http://chintalks.blogspot.com/2007/12/searching-for-frank-chin.html and that the wife is not ignored, but honored by being depicted in images next to the kitchen god.\\"What's Wrong With Frank Chin\\" movie trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nEid76GQMY&x-yt-cl;=85114404&x-yt- ts;=1422579428Bulletproof Buddhists and Other Essays By Frank Chin.

In the waning of the glow of Joy Luck Club, further Asian American stories were mostly shot down by studios after the brief rush following the film.

Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, have become common since his inauguration on January 20, 2001. Many popular TV shows, magazines, books and comics have portrayed or satirized him. Several comedians and comic actors were known for impressions of Bush during his presidency, including Will Ferrell and Will Forte (both originally on Saturday Night Live), Jon Culshaw, Frank Caliendo, James Adomian and Jon Stewart. Impressionist Steve Bridges had a notably involved impression that included facial prosthetics to achieve similarity to Bush; he impersonated Bush in a variety of settings, including once alongside the real President Bush at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association dinner. Actor Timothy Bottoms portrayed Bush fictionally multiple times during the Bush presidency: in the Comedy Central sitcom That's My Bush!, as a cameo in the family film The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, and in a serious role in the telefilm DC 9/11 (2003). Bush was the target of satire for most of his presidency. Most fictional depictions of the President in popular media tend to emphasize his drawl and tendency to use incorrect grammar and malapropisms in speeches, as well as his sometimes awkward hand and facial gestures. Bush is often depicted in caricatures with a large nose and ears, and small eyes, giving him a somewhat elfin appearance, or sometimes to look similar to a chimpanzee. He is also sometimes drawn in political cartoons as being short in stature, although in reality he is taller than the average American. Most fictionalized portrayals of George W. Bush have been negative. Film =W.= Bush was portrayed by Josh Brolin in W., a biographical film by Oliver Stone. The film is similar in format to Nixon, another film by Stone, covering Bush's life from his early childhood and college years, to his early political career and struggles with alcoholism, to his 2003 invasion of Iraq. W. was released on October 17, 2008 and is the first time a major motion picture has been made about a U.S. President while he was still in office. =Dasavathaaram= Dasavathaaram (2008) is an Indian film which stars popular Indian actor Kamal Haasan. He dons ten different roles in this film and one of those is the portrayal of George W. Bush. =My Name Is Khan= In the 2010 Indian film My Name Is Khan, Bush is an unseen character who refuses to meet with Khan and accept that he is not a terrorist. =Death of a President= Bush is the target of an assassination in Chicago, Illinois in this fictional tale during his presidency. Death of a President mirrors similar details surrounding the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan during the early 1980s. Facing broad unpopular support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he becomes the target of an assassin with a political agenda. =Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay= In Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, the 2008 sequel to Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle features James Adomian as Bush in a scene where he smokes cocaine-laced marijuana with the title characters. =The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course= The 2002 action comedy film The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course featured a cameo by Timothy Bottoms as President Bush. =DC 9/11: Time of Crisis= In 2004, Showtime broadcast a made-for-television movie titled DC 9/11: Time of Crisis reenacting the September 11, 2001 attacks from the point of view of President Bush. The movie was a drama, and reviewers stated that its portrayal of George W. Bush, again by Bottoms, was generally in a positive light. =The Master of Disguise= In the film The Master of Disguise, the main character (played by Dana Carvey) dresses up as Bush and comments \\"Folks around here call me W.\\" =Scary Movie 4= In Scary Movie 4, the President of the United States is reading a children book in a classroom, similar to George W. Bush's reading of The Pet Goat. When he is told the nation is under the attack (similar to Bush during the September 11 attacks) of alien \\"triPods\\" he replies: \\"Right now I want to hear what happened to the duckling\\" (in a spoof of Bush's reaction to the attacks). =Transformers= In the 2007 Transformers film, the president is not stated to be Bush, but heavily implied to be him. However, in the direct sequel Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the reference to the actual President Barack Obama as well as brief glimpses of Bush in a news broadcast suggest that the president shown in the original is in fact President Bush. He is shown lying in bed (with his face obscured by his feet from the camera's point of view) saying to one of the flight attendants (with a Bush-like voice, a heavy southern accent and a Bush-style laughter), \\"Hey, could you wrangle me up some Ding Dongs?\\" The Secretary of Defense, played by Jon Voight, has him guarded in a bunker for his protection during the rest of the film. =Postal= In the comedy movie Postal, Bush is portrayed by Brent Mendenhall. =Lange Flate Ball√¶r II= In the 2008 Norwegian comedy sequel Lange Flate Ball√¶r 2, after the main characters (Petter, √òyvind, Edgar, Karsten, Kai and Freddy) have prevented an American nuclear submarine from exploding and thus save the world, Bush (played by Steve Bridges) pays them a visit at their garage in Fredrikstad, Norway. =Megumi= George W. Bush appears briefly in a still animated frame of the anime version of Megumi. =American Made= Connor Trinneer plays a young George Bush in the 2017 film American Made. =Vice= Sam Rockwell plays George Bush in the 2018 film Vice. =Malesh Ehna Benetbahdel= Bush was portrayed by Brent Mendenhall in Malesh Ehna Benetbahdel, 2005 Egyptian film. Bush appliers as the president of the United States, who wants Karmouti (Ahmad Adam) to falsely admit of doing terrorist attacks and dealing with weapons of mass destruction for Russia. Animated television =2DTV= 2DTV (a UK satire cartoon) regularly portrayed George W. Bush as a childish simpleton who would often make hazardous decisions while in the Oval Office. The character would not listen to advice from his advisor, the General, unless he put a sock on his hand and humoured Bush like a child. These segments were extremely popular in the United Kingdom and highlighted Bush's unpopularity in the country. In early 2003, an advertisement for video compilation The Best of 2DTV was prevented from airing in the UK. The advertisement involved Bush taking the compilation cassette out of its case and putting it in a toaster. It was banned because the British advertising watchdog stated that advertisements for products cannot appear to be endorsed by someone without their permission ‚Äì in this case George W. Bush. This decision was later overturned (due to it being legitimate satire) and the commercial was shown unedited. The makers later said that this generated more publicity than the actual advertisement could ever have produced. The makers of 2DTV also made another short Bush sketch, in which he writes a letter, resenting his portrayal in the media as a moron. He then places the letter in a toaster. =Family Guy and American Dad!= On Family Guy, Bush has been shown in multiple episodes, doing things like showing up late for duty in the Vietnam War in the episode \\"PTV\\" and hiding in his Texas treehouse to avoid news of Hurricane Katrina in \\"The Fat Guy Strangler\\". In \\"Don't Make Me Over\\", Peter Griffin is chosen to perform for him at the White House. He acts like a clown, causing Bush to laugh childishly until he knocks over a snowglobe, causing him to cry equally childishly. In \\"Saving Private Brian\\", Stewie Griffin enlists himself and Brian Griffin to the US Army and both are sent to fight in Iraq. They are trying to be discharged when all of a sudden, democracy kicks in exactly as Bush predicted, allowing them to go home. Stewie says he wishes to know who is the genius behind that war plan. Said that, the episode cuts to a scene of Bush pushing a Slinky down a set of stairs in the White House. After failing the first attempt to make the toy go down all of the steps, he succeeded in his second try, and exclaims: \\"Laura... Laura!\\". The most recent appearance of Bush on Family Guy was on the episode \\"Excellence in Broadcasting,\\" in which Bush runs into the room in a childish manner and jumps into Rush Limbaugh's arms while saying many childish things. Limbaugh then proceeds to give him a lollipop and he runs off. Bush has been cited as the inspiration for the long-running adult animated series American Dad! When asked what first sparked the idea for American Dad! Seth MacFarlane answered, \\"It was right after the [2000] election, and me and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the Bush administration that we would just spend days bitching and complaining, and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable.\\" The series has even had an episode titled \\"Bush Comes to Dinner\\" in which then President Bush appears, presented as a buffoon. =King of the Hill= In the King of the Hill episode \\"The Perils of Polling\\", which aired shortly before the 2000 election, Hank Hill meets then- Governor Bush of Texas, only to be deeply disappointed by his limp handshake. As a result, Hank plans to boycott the polls, but in the end changes his mind and decides to vote. This is a rare positive portrayal of the President. =Lil' Bush= Lil' Bush is an animated political satire/sitcom from creator Donick Cary. It debuted on Comedy Central on June 13, 2007. Instead of portraying George W. Bush as the current president, Lil' Bush is shown as the son of President George H. W. Bush, portrayed as the current president. Lil' Bush and his friends (Lil' Cheney, Lil' Condi, etc.) all attend an elementary school with other current political figures. =Robot Chicken= George W. Bush was portrayed on the Star Wars special of the stop-motion animation show Robot Chicken aired on Cartoon Network. In the short sketch, an action figure version of the president was shown as dreaming that he had Jedi powers, as well as fighting former U.S. president Abraham Lincoln with a lightsaber and chopping off his daughter Jenna's finger in a parody of famous scenes from Star Wars. He uses Jedi mind tricks to get a parking place and get his wife Laura to have a menage a trois with him and Condoleezza Rice. In another episode, \\"Tapping a Hero\\", Bush comes into possession of a mogwai and proceeds to do everything he was instructed not to do with it (i.e. get it wet, feed it past midnight, etc.). Eventually, one of the clones gets a hold of the nuclear launch codes, and destroys the world. Bush is voiced by Seth Green. =The Simpsons= During his term as governor of Texas, Bush was satirized on The Simpsons episode \\"Two Bad Neighbors\\" when his parents George and Barbara move in across the street from the Simpsons and Homer and Bart Simpson trick the elder Bush into answering the door with two cardboard cutouts of George W. and Jeb Bush. According to the show's creators, they were unaware that George and Barbara Bush's eldest son was actually named George and said that the term \\"George Bush, Jr.\\" was intended to be a joke about the stupidity of Homer and Bart's plans. In a reference to the same episode, Homer has a photo album, stating \\"Here's me beating up former President Bush, here's me beating up current President Bush, and here's me showing a sack of apples who's boss.\\" In The Father, The Son, and the Holy Guest Star, while Bush isn't directly referenced by name, Homer makes a passing reference to a \\"Commander Cuckoo Bananas\\" causing a lot of American military quagmires, which serves as a thinly veiled metaphore for Bush. =South Park= President Bush and Condoleezza Rice appear in South Park. South Park displayed the character of George W. Bush in multiple episodes. He is first seen briefly in the episode \\"Super Best Friends\\" standing alongside animated portrayals of the cast of That's My Bush! In \\"A Ladder to Heaven\\", he tries to wage a war against Saddam Hussein, who, in South Park's continuity, is a spirit kicked out of Hell and dwelling unwillingly in Heaven. Bush recollects the history of Saddam's character in the show's continuity to the United Nations. Bush later appears, albeit briefly, in \\"South Park is Gay!\\", where the cast from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy give him a makeover as part of an evil plan for world domination. Bush is later shown with an updated look in the two-part episode \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\" and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\", where he attempts to stop a cartoon depicting the Prophet Mohammed from airing for fear of terrorist retaliation. When he fails and the show is broadcast, Ayman al-Zawahiri makes a \\"retaliation\\" cartoon that depicts him and other Americans defecating on Jesus and the American flag. Bush is also seen in \\"Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\\", which deals with 9/11 conspiracy theories. In this episode he reveals to Stan and Kyle Broflovski that all the theories are true, and that he and his administration carried out the 9/11 attacks to invade Iraq. By the end of the episode, however, it is revealed that this was a lie, and that all the conspiracy theories were actually made up by his administration so that the government would seem all-powerful. He also had a final, brief cameo in \\"The Snuke,\\" which deals with an attempted terrorist attack by a bomb planted in Hillary Clinton's vagina. He was at one point set to appear in \\"About Last Night...\\" and was to take the blame for the Hope Diamond heist (performed by Barack Obama and John McCain in the episode) in a spoof of Ocean's Eleven. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, cut the scene because they considered Bush a \\"dead man walking\\". In the episode, although the White House and even the Oval Office are seen, Bush is missing and never referred to. =Time Squad= Bush made an appearance in an episode of the 2001‚Äì2003 animated series Time Squad, trying to make the biggest ball of twine in the world to \\"bring America together\\". Bush's father George H. W. Bush made an appearance as well. =Sons of Butcher= In the Canadian animated series Sons of Butcher, in the episode \\"Payin' The Bills\\", Bush is seen playing video games with two other politicians in his office. When told of an army forming in the fictional country of Afghanaraq (where Sol was at the time), he decided to launch a missile there, but pushes the wrong button, thereby launching a missile to Aljania by mistake (after pressing the button, he said \\"I love doing that\\"). When he realizes what he did, he simply laughs and says \\"oops\\" before he hits the right button, thereby launching a missile in the right country. Live action television =Kopspijkers= In Kopspijkers, a Dutch public television talk show, Thomas van Luyn as President Bush was set before a fictional press and sang an edited version of the song \\"Always on My Mind\\". =Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson= Comedian James Adomian has appeared frequently as George W. Bush on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson since Ferguson began hosting the program in 2005. Sketches often include Bush (Adomian) being interviewed by Craig Ferguson, or appearing next to Ferguson at a mock press conference. =Dead Ringers= On the BBC British comedy impression show Dead Ringers, Bush was a recurring target for satire, being portrayed by Jon Culshaw. The parodies of Bush put emphasis and exaggeration on the concept of Bushisms, general ignorance and lampooned malapropisms, such as \\"My fellow Abbytitmuses, this is your Sterident speaking...\\" and \\"I want Osama Bin Laden capturised alive or dead or both!\\". =MADtv= For several seasons, Bush was portrayed by Frank Caliendo on MADtv. Usually, he's portrayed as simple-minded fool. Since Caliendo left the show in 2006, Bush was played by James Adomian in voiceover parts. Bush was also played by Christian Duguay during the show's sixth season. During Will Sasso's five-year tenure with the show, he also played George W. Bush. =Saturday Night Live= During the 2000 campaign and first year of his presidency, Bush was portrayed on Saturday Night Live by Will Ferrell, who emphasized the innocent, childlike aspect of the character (in one skit Jeb Bush (played by Val Kilmer) gives George a toy to play with so he can talk with Al Gore). Ferrell played Bush from 1999 to 2002, until he departed from the show. Cast member Chris Parnell took over the portrayal of Bush when Ferrell left. Since Parnell's impression was not as popular as Ferrell's, cast member Darrell Hammond was selected to replace him as Bush in late 2003. Hammond made only two appearances as Bush, and was replaced by cast member Will Forte in 2004. Forte chose to portray Bush as less innocent and more nervous. Although Forte's portrayal was far more popular than either Parnell's or Hammond's, it was never as well-received as Ferrell's. Newer cast member Jason Sudeikis took over the role from Forte in 2006 for unexplained reasons. Will Ferrell reprised the role when he hosted. =That's My Bush!= That's My Bush! was a short-lived live-action political satire/sitcom from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It aired on Comedy Central in first run from April through June 2001. Despite being about the fictional exploits of the president, it instead mostly satirized 1970s, 1980s, and workplace sitcoms; indeed, it was originally pitched as being about Al Gore, implying that jokes about George Bush were never really meant to be the show's main feature. The show often portrayed Bush dealing with both a sitcom-type situation and a political one at the same time, such as having a romantic dinner with Laura the same night as a major dinner with both sides of the abortion debate. George W. Bush was generally portrayed as being foolish (as were most of the characters) yet essentially honest in his efforts. The show was eventually canceled due to high production costs and insufficient ratings. After the attacks of September 11, Comedy Central stopped showing reruns of the show. The complete series was released on DVD in 2006. =World Wrestling Entertainment= On the December 18 edition of WWE Raw, a George W. Bush impersonator entered the ring in aid of Cryme Tyme, an African American tag team. Though Cryme Tyme were faces in the WWE, meaning they are supposed to be cheered, Bush himself was booed by the live crowd. The impersonation sketch they performed referenced multiple African American celebrities, including Kanye West as well as Bush Administration officials Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. At one point, the Bush character confused George Jefferson for Thomas Jefferson, claiming that the Jeffersons character had written the Declaration of Independence. He then began to say \\"You know he's my nigga,\\" before being interrupted by Cryme Tyme in the middle of the last word. At the end of the sketch, Cryme Tyme stole Bush's wallet, and in return Bush started to yell \\"Arrest those niggers,\\" before again catching himself in mid-word and following up with \\"Arrest those people.\\" Cryme Tyme was not apprehended, however. Bush then turned at the end of the entrance ramp before exiting the arena and flipped off the crowd. =Mr. Deity= In the episode \\"Mr. Deity and the Intel\\" of Mr. Deity George W. Bush is portrayed by Louie Sadd, where Mr. Deity (God) is discussing the 2003 War On Terror with Bush, but Deity doesn't understand him that well and does not really know what would happen with the war. =Off-the-cuff impersonations= Often, when a story involving George W. Bush is shown on The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart hunches his shoulders, squints his eyes, talks in a voice similar to Bush's, and uses strange hand gestures, occasionally accompanied by Beavis and Butt-head-style laughing. Comics First appearance of Imperial Bush in Doonesbury. =Doonesbury= In the political comic Doonesbury, President George W. Bush was symbolized by a Stetson hat atop a giant asterisk. The hat referred to his time spent as Governor of Texas; Doonesbury artist Garry Trudeau refers to Bush of being \\"all hat and no cattle\\".Sandra L. Dahlberg, \\"'All hat and no cattle': separate and unequal funding for higher education in Texas\\", Radical Teacher, summer 2005 The asterisk was intended to represent the special circumstances surrounding Bush's election, it being the typical symbol to mark footnoted special circumstances in any standard record book. Later, President Bush's symbol was changed to a Roman military helmet (again, atop an asterisk) representing imperialism. Towards the end of his first term, the helmet became battered, with the giltwork starting to come off and with clumps of bristles missing from the top, but on September 2, 2006, he fantasized about himself wearing a crown. Starting on November 2, 2010, Roland Hedley began interviewing President Bush for Fox News. The interview was in anticipation of the release of Bush's memoir, Decision Points, which was due to be released on November 9. At that point, the asterisk remained but nearly all of the Roman helmet was gone. All that remained was the crest holder (sans crest) which was so badly battered that it resembled an all-in-one assembly of Allen wrenches.Doonesbury archive at Slate.com November 2, 2010. =If...= In his political comic strip If..., English cartoonist Steve Bell depicts President Bush as a chimpanzee.Job done; If... May 26, 2004. Bell first drew Bush as a chimpanzee in a cartoon on his inauguration, as a reference to the 1951 film Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan. Bell later explained that he originally did not intend to continue with depicting Bush as a chimpanzee, but eventually come to find the portrayal very fitting after studying Bush's body language.Steve Bell on George Bush January 16, 2009. =Ultimates= Bush also appears in a cameo during the first volume of Marvel comics \\"The Ultimates\\". While no commentary was made on his policies, the President did seem flustered as he spoke to the then-recently awoken and fairly impressive Captain America. He shows up again in the second volume of The Ultimates where he is captured by an anti-American superhero group called The Liberators. =Ultimate X-Men= Bush was also portrayed in Ultimate X-Men. He becomes an ally to the X-Men after they rescue his daughter from Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. After Magneto attacked America, he was stripped naked by him and forced to lick his boots clean while on live TV. Afterwards, Magneto attempted to drop a car on him, but was stopped when the X-Men intervened. The car's license plate read as \\"DUBYA\\". =Twisted Kaiju Theater= In the popular webcomic Twisted Kaiju Theater, Bush is a recurring villain. Here is depicted is a childish simpleton who cries when he loses. He is also obsessed with oil, attempting to obtain Neo Monster Islands oil at literally any cost. He also says that non-Christians have no souls, believes that same-sex marriage is a threat to America, and his motto is, \\"Fuck the poor\\" (a parody of his alleged hostility to working-class citizens).

Meath, who went down in medieval tradition as a disciple of St Patrick and one of the first bishops of Armagh.Stalmans and Charles-Edwards, \\"Meath, saints of (act. c.400‚Äìc.900)\\". Historians have suggested, however, that the connection with St Patrick was a later tradition invented by Armagh historians in favour of their patron saint and that Secundinus is more likely to have been a separate missionary, possibly a companion of Palladius. Background and sources Little is known about the saint and his cult. His foundation is Domnach Sechnaill ('Church of Sechnall'),Irish preface to the Hymn of Secundinus, ed. Bernard and Atkinson.F√©lire √ìengusso (27 November, note), ed. Stokes, p. 248. now Dunshaughlin (Co. Meath), not far from Tara, and to judge by the use of the toponymic element domnach (from Latin dominicum), the church is likely to be early.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 233-4. T.M. Charles-Edwards suggests that the site may have belonged originally to the province of Leinster rather than Mide, but that the political geography had changed by the 8th century, when much of southern Brega was divided between different septs of the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine. By that time, Domnach Sechnaill lay in the kingdom of the U√≠ Chernaig, close to the royal crann√≥g seat in Loch nGabor, as did the churches of Trevet and Kilbrew. Linguistic arguments in favour of the early date of the saint's arrival and his foundation have also been advanced with respect to the saint's name in Latin and Irish. The Late Latin name Secundinus was a common one across Latin- speaking parts of Europe. His name was borrowed into the vernacular as Sechnall, according to a pattern for which David N. Dumville proposes the following stages of development: Secundinus > *Sechundinus > *Sechundƒ´n…ôs > *Sechundƒ´n > *Sechnd…ôn > *Sechn…ôn and finally by the 8/9th century, > *Sechn…ôl.Dumville, \\"Auxilius, Iserninus, Secundinus and Benignus\\", p. 99. If correct, this pattern lends further credence to a 5th-century floruit of the saint.Dumville, \\"Auxilius, Iserninus, Secundinus and Benignus\\", p. 100. Traditions about the saint are witnessed by variety of sources, including Irish annals, the F√©lire √ìengusso and other martyrologies, the Tripartite Life of St Patrick and a list of the coarbs of St Patrick. Secundinus is also the ascribed author of an early Latin hymn in praise of St Patrick, known as Audite Omnes Amantes ('Hear ye, All lovers') or the Hymn of Secundinus written in trochaic septenarius, the earliest copy of which is found in the late 7th- century Antiphonary of Bangor. The ascription to Secundinus, whether true or false, is commonplace in medieval sources, occurring as early as in the F√©lire √ìengusso,e.g. F√©lire √ìengusso, ed. Stokes, p. 237. and notably appears in the Irish preface preserved in some manuscript copies of the Hymn. This preface adds some biographical detail, including a legend about Sechnall's quarrel and reconciliation with Patrick leading up to the composition of the hymn. A hagiographical Life was written for the saint, but it comes down to us only in a 17th-century manuscript compilation donated by Irish Jesuit Henry FitzSimon to the Bollandists.Sharpe, Medieval Irish saints' lives, p. 375. The manuscript is found in the Bollandist collection of the Royal Library of Brussels under the shelfmark MS 8957-8. Life The Irish annals report that in 439, bishops Secundinus, Auxilius and Iserninus arrived in Ireland to the aid of St Patrick.O'Rahilly, The Two Patricks, p. 21.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 439 (\\"Secundinus, Auxilius, & Iserninus mituntur (&) episcopi ipsi, in Hiberniam, in auxilium Patricii\\"); Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 439; Chronicon Scotorum, CS438. Muirch√∫ also tells of the involvement of Auxilius and Iserninus, both possibly from Auxerre, but does not name Secundinus. Later tradition, which is of uncertain provenance, appears to suggest that Secundinus and Auxilius were of Italian origin. Details to this effect are first given in the Irish preface to the Hymn of Secundinus as found in some manuscript versions of the Liber Hymnorum. It states that Secundinus was a son of Restitutus and St Patrick's sister Dar Ercae; in the Chronicon Scotorum the latter is named Culmana.Chronicon Scotorum CS 446. The preface cites a stanza by Armagh scholar Eochaid ua Flannacain (d. 1005) to assert that Restitutus belonged to the Lombards of Letha, a place-name which referred to Gaul but was sometimes confused with Latium.O'Rahilly, The Two Patricks, p. 27. In the stanza, Sechnall receives the paternal family name moccu Baird.Irish preface to the Hymn of Secundinus, ed. Bernard and Atkinson, tr. Carey, p. 149. Although the presence of Lombards in Italy would be an anachronism, Thomas F. O'Rahilly considers it possible that Secundinus ‚Äì and perhaps Auxilius, too ‚Äì came from northern Italy. Like the saint's own name, Restitutus was a popular Late Latin name in Christian Europe, but in this case there is no way of telling whether Patrician historians were using genuine information or filling in gaps in the saint's genealogical dossier.Dumville, \\"Auxilius, Iserninus, Secundinus and Benignus\\", pp. 98 n. 69 and 104. Some scholars have suggested that Secundinus preceded Saint Patrick in Ireland. In his lecture The Two Patricks, O'Rahilly argues that Secundinus, possibly a native of northern Italy (see above), was one of three bishops who arrived in Ireland in 439 to assist Palladius, whose mission had begun in 431 and who was known in Ireland as Patricius (leading to confusion with the later Saint Patrick). In 441 Palladius was recalled to Rome to be examined by the newly elected Pope Leo I, leaving Secundinus in charge of the Church in Ireland. He became known as the first Christian bishop to die on Irish soil. Dumville allows for the possibility that Secundinus participated in the Palladian mission, but is more hesitant. The development of Patrician legend also saw Secundinus becoming gradually more involved in the process whereby the see of Armagh received the relics of Saints Peter and Paul. St Patrick, according to his Tripartite Life, entrusted his see to Secundinus when he went to Rome to obtain the relics, while the preface to the Hymn tells that Patrick had sent him off to obtain them in person.Cf. note to F√©lire √ìengusso (1 October), ed. Stokes, pp. 220-1.Bieler, \\"St. Secundinus and Armagh\\", p. 22 n. 3. Secundinus is said to have died in 447 or 448, aged 75.Annals of Ulster s.a. 447. Cf. Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 448. Commemoration The saint's name was familiar enough in Mide to give rise to a number of derivative personal names, notably M√°el Sechnaill (attested since the 9th century) and later also Gilla Sechnaill. Despite the evidence for a medieval Life, there is little in the sources to suggest that Sechnall was the subject of a flourishing cult during much of the Middle Ages. His feast-day is 27 November.F√©lire √ìengusso, 27 November.

Afton Down faces Compton Bay directly to the west, while Freshwater is approximately one mile north. It was the site of the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, where the Guinness Book of Records estimates 600,000 to 700,000, and possibly 800,000 people, flocked to see the musical talents of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Free, The Who, The Doors, Ten Years After and Jimi Hendrix. In keeping with the native flora of Compton Bay, a variety of hardy plants grow on the down. Large European gorse bushes grow on the cliff, with the shelter they provide allowing other plants such as wild cabbage and bird's foot trefoil to thrive. Due to the strong prevailing wind from the English channel to the west, no large trees are able to grow on the down, allowing shrubs and grasses to thrive. The Isle of Wight's county flower, the pyramidal orchid, also grows here, along with Plantago lanceolata, the main food plant for the rare Glanville fritillary. A car park is situated near the highest point of the Military Road's route over the down, and allows for walkers to travel along a footpath downhill towards Freshwater Bay. There is an obelisk on Afton Down near the cliff edge. It is inscribed with a memorial to 15 year-old Edward Lewis Miller of Goudhurst in Kent who died after falling from the cliff in 1846. This obelisk was Grade II listed in 1994. Each side of the obelisk is inscribed with biblical passages in relation to the afterlife. Freshwater Bay In the 17th century it was common for local people to descend the cliffs to collect seabirds and pick samphire. The birds were killed and plucked and their feathers sold, and the carcasses were sold to local fisherman to bait crab pots. The samphire was pickled and sent to London in barrels. Freshwater Bay Golf Course is located on Afton Down. On the downs are a group of 24 barrows comprising, a long barrow 34.7 m long, 0.9 m high and oriented east- west, 17 bowl barrows, 4 bell barrows and 2 disc barrows (One of which is where the golf course is located). One barrow has been the subject of archaeological interest, and is thought to be from the Bronze Age. The site was excavated in 1817 revealing nothing of significance in the long barrow, but several cremations in the round barrows.

It is a condition of both human and veterinary pathology. Feline eosinophilic granuloma complex is synonymous with feline eosinophilic skin diseases. This is considered to be a cutaneous reaction pattern that can be the manifestation of a number of underlying infections, allergies or ectoparasite infestations. It can also be idiopathic, that is have no known underlying trigger. The eosinophilic reaction is common in feline inflammatory disease and the eosinophilic granuloma can be a hereditary reaction pattern in some lines of domestic cats. Signs and symptoms =Humans= In humans, eosinophilic granulomas are considered a benign histiocytosis that occurs mainly in adolescents and young adults. Clinically, unifocal lytic lesions are found in bones such as the skull, ribs and femur. Because of this, bone pain and pathologic fractures are common. =Cats= Cat with ulcerative dermatitis of the nose caused by mosquito bite hypersensitivity Cats with eosinophilic granuloma complex (EGC) may have one or more of four patterns of skin disease. The most frequent form is eosinophilic plaque. This is a rash comprising raised red to salmon-colored and flat-topped, moist bumps scattered on the skin surface. The most common location is on the ventral abdomen and inner thigh. Another form of EGC is the lip ulcer. This is a painless, shallow ulcer with raised and thickened edges that forms on the upper lip adjacent to the upper canine tooth. It is often found on both sides of the upper lips. The third form of the EGC is the collagenolytic granuloma. This is a firm swelling that may be ulcerated. The lesions may form on the skin, especially of the face, in the mouth, or on the feet, or may form linear flat-topped raised hairless lesions on the back of the hind legs, also called linear granuloma. The least common form of EGC is atypical eosinophilic dermatitis. It is unique in that it is caused by mosquito bite allergy and the lesions form on the parts of the body with the least hair affording easy access to feeding mosquitoes. This includes the bridge of the nose, the outer tips of the ears and the skin around the pads of the feet. The lesions are red bumps, shallow ulcers and crusts. Causes Aside from the mosquito allergy cat, cats with EGC usually have allergy, ectoparasite infestation or possibly ringworm or other skin infection. Other implicated causes include traumatic damage, autoimmune disease or FeLV infection. Treatment The basis of management is to find and correct the underlying cause. Many times cats with EGC will respond to treatment with corticosteroids or to ciclosporin.

Background The song was first recorded by Bing Crosby on July 5, 1934 with Irving Aaronson and his Commanders for Brunswick Records. The same year, it was one of the nominees for the inaugural \\"Best Song\\" Academy Award when it lost out to \\"The Continental\\". Crosby re-recorded the song for his 1954 album Bing: A Musical Autobiography.

Biography =Early life= Dorothy Marie Johnson was born in McGregor, Iowa, the only daughter of Lester Eugene Johnson and Mary Louisa Barlow. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Montana. While she was a student at Whitefish High School she began to write professionally, working as a newspaper stringer for The Daily Inter Lake in Kalispell, Montana. She studied English in college before a brief marriage which ended with a divorce. =Professional life= Her writing career seemed to take off in 1935 when she sold her first short story to The Saturday Evening Post for the sum of $400. But Johnson did not sell another story for 11 years until, in 1941, four stories narrated by a recurring character, \\"Beulah Bunny,\\" sold to The Saturday Evening Post for $2,100. Her writing was temporarily sidetracked by World War II, when she went to work for the Air Warden Service. After the war, she produced some of her best-known Western stories. Three of these would later be made into notable films, namely A Man Called Horse (1950), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1953) and The Hanging Tree (1957). Between 1956-60, Johnson taught creative writing at the University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, from which she had graduated in 1928. Prior to and during her tenure, she wrote numerous articles and fictional stories for many different magazines. These were often based on interviews with Western old-timers, Native Americans and characters she met during her tenure as secretary and researcher for The Montana Historical Society. She was also secretary/manager of the Montana Press Association in the 1950s. Honors In 1957, the Western Writers of America gave her its highest award, the Spur Award, for her short story, Lost Sister, a short story in \\"The Hanging Tree\\" collection, that deals with the reintegration into white settler society of Cynthia Ann Parker, who had been kidnapped by Comanche as a child. In 1959, she was made an honorary member of the Blackfoot Tribe. In 1976, 'the Writers' again awarded her the Levi Strauss Golden Saddleman Award, for bringing dignity and honor to the history and legends of the West. In 2005, a 30-minute documentary film was made of her life by Sue Hart of Montana State University, Billings The four-year effort was written and co-produced by Hart, along with producer Gene Bodeur, director Bill Bilverstone and film director Lansing Dreamer. Margot Kidder lent her voice to the effort. It was titled Gravel in her Gut and Spit in her Eye, and shown on PBS in November 2005. Johnson was inducted in 2013 to the Montana Cowboy Hall Of Fame and Western Heritage Center for the \\"Legacy Award\\" for her \\"notable contributions to the history and culture of Montana\\". Death Johnson always prided herself on her self-sufficiency after a failed marriage early in life. She stated that her epitaph should read \\"Paid In Full.\\" Her grave in the cemetery in Whitefish, Montana reads simply \\"PAID\\". She died on November 11, 1984, aged 78.Guide to the Dorothy M.

Although the group had no formal structure of officials, she was often seen as the \\"ring leader\\" of the group.

The term is also used by some armed forces which are not NATO members. Typically, one-star officers hold the rank of commodore, flotilla admiral, brigadier general, brigadier, or in the case of those air forces with a separate rank structure, air commodore. Officers of one-star rank are either the most junior of the flag, general and air officer ranks, or are not considered to hold the distinction at all. Specifically, in many navies, one-star officers are not considered to be flag officers, although this is not always the case. The army and air force rank of brigadier general is, by definition, a general officer rank. However, the equivalent rank of brigadier is usually not designated as a general officer. The air force rank of air commodore is always considered to be an air-officer rank. Australia In the Australian Defence Force the following ranks of commissioned officers are awarded one-star ranks: *Commodore (Royal Australian Navy one-star rank) *Brigadier (Australian Army one-star rank) *Air commodore (Royal Australian Air Force one-star rank) Canada *Commodore (Royal Canadian Navy one-star- equivalent rank) *Brigadier-general/brigadier-g√©n√©ral (Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force one-star-equivalent rank) The maple leaf appears with St. Edward's crown and crossed sabre and baton.

Diack wrote in a footnote: ‚ÄúThe spelling hccvvevv looks uncouth, but it is so only in the same way as foreigners speaking their own language are described as \\"jabbering\\" by those unfamiliar with it. The orthographical practice in late ogams in Scotland is usually to write all consonants double, whether historically double or not, except when beginning a word and except m and s. Aspiration is sometimes indicated by writing h before the aspirated consonant, not after it as in the later texts and to-day. We write the word here, therefore, in unaspirated form, cvev, which stands for older qvev or gev according to the orthography employed (usually in the inscriptions the labialised q is written merely q, not qv). The word qev, \\"vassal, servant,\\" occurs so spelt in an unpublished ogam from northern Scotland, of date before A.D. 600. The modern Gaelic, descending from qev by regular phonetic law, is ce, \\"companion, spouse,\\" the same semantic development as is seen in celi above, which gives to-day ceile, of the same meaning. It may be remarked in passing that this Old Gaelic inscription of Lunnasting was specially selected by Bhys to \\"challenge\\" the possibility of its being explained by \\"any Aryan language\\" (Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot., vol. xxxii. p. 325).‚Äù but it is otherwise without certain interpretation. Forsyth suggests Ahehhttannn is also a personal name. Other recent attempts include: :\\"King Nechtan of the kin of Ahehhtmnnn\\" :\\"The widow of Kenneth made (these as) testimonials on her part\\".Schei (2006) p 104 The word-dividing dots suggest Norse influence, but this could pre-date the Viking occupation of Shetland, and an eighth- or ninth-century origin is likely for the ogham work. Other theories The difficulties in providing a clear interpretation of the script have led to a number of other suggestions.

The Fund provides an average of 6,000 annual scholarships for American Indian students and also provides support for other needs at the tribal colleges ranging from capital support to cultural preservation activities. Charity Navigator gave the College Fund an overall rating of 88.36 out of 100. Information The American Indian College Fund (the College Fund) was established in 1989 as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization to provide American Indians with student scholarships. The College Fund also helps support tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) located on or near Indian reservations through capital grants and programs such as cultural and language preservation, early childhood education programs on-campus for children of students and community members; fellowships for faculty development; and college readiness, internship, career readiness, and leadership development programs. Today American Indians account for only 1% of all college students, and 13.6% of American Indians over age 25 years old have a bachelor's degree compared to 29.3% of the overall population. Poverty is part of the reason so few American Indians and Alaska Natives go to college, with current data showing that 28.3% of the American Indian and Alaska Natives living below the poverty level compared to 15.5% of the overall population.American Community Survey 2014 , 1-Year Estimates, retrieved Jan. 7, 2016.  History and mission  During the Civil Rights Acts and Native American self-determination movements in 1960s and 1970s, tribal leaders decided there was a need for change in failed federal education policy to improve education for American Indian students to serve their communities, leading to the creation of tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). In 1968, the Navajo Nation created the first-of-its-kind educational institution‚Äîa college controlled by the tribe, located on the Navajo reservation, to provide a quality higher education to the surrounding community, known as a tribal college and university. TCU presidents established the College Fund in 1989 in New York City to raise private-sector funds for scholarships for American Indian students and to raise money for financial support for the tribal colleges, while broadening awareness of those institutions and the College Fund itself. In 2015-16, the College Fund distributed more than $8.1 million in direct support to students, including scholarships, internships, leadership training, career readiness, and other programmatic support. Scholarship recipients are selected on the basis of academic success, financial need, community involvement, and commitment to their tribal communities. To date the College Fund has provided more than 100,000 scholarships since its inception and an average of 6,000 scholarships per year to American Indian students. The College Fund also helps support accredited tribal colleges with research and leadership grants, cultural preservation programs, early childhood education programs, and faculty development fellowships as well as with institutional funding. The American Indian College Fund has received top ratings from independent charity evaluators. It earned the Best in America Seal of Excellence from America's Best Charities. Of the one million charities operating in the United States, fewer than 2,000 organizations have been awarded this seal. The College Fund meets the Standards for Charity Accountability of the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance. The College Fund received a B+ rating from Charity Watch. The College Fund received a gold rating from GuideStar in 2017, a four-star rating from Charity Navigator for FY2016, and a three star rating for 2018. Originally headquartered in New York City, the College Fund relocated to Denver, Colorado in 2002. Tribal colleges Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are vital to Native Americans and are beneficial to the country as a whole. They help Native communities and students gain a valuable education and also preserve Native language, culture and traditions through language curriculum and American Indian studies. Since the first tribal college was established in 1968, the number of tribal colleges and universities has grown to 37 in the United States in 2016. According to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, TCUs are chartered by their respective tribal governments, including the ten tribes within the largest reservations in the United States. They operate more than 75 campuses in 16 states‚Äîvirtually covering Indian Country‚Äîand serve students from well more than 230 federally recognized Indian tribes. TCUs vary in enrollment (size), focus (liberal arts, sciences, workforce development/training), location (woodlands, desert, frozen tundra, rural reservation, urban), and student population (predominantly American Indian). Despite their diversity, tribal identity is the core of every TCU, and they all share the mission of tribal self-determination and service to their respective communities. TCUs engage in partnerships with organizations including U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and universities nationwide to support research and education programs that focus on issues such as climate change, sustainable agriculture, water quality, wildlife population dynamics, and diabetes prevention. Many support distance learning involving state-of-the-art learning environments. TCU faculty is engaged in research in many areas including hydrology, molecular cell biology, archaeology, entomology, community health, environmental science, aerospace engineering, and advanced manufacturing processes. The majority of faculty, teaching staff, and administrators hold a master's or doctoral degree. Many faculty and staff members often serve double-duty as counselors and mentors in addition to their teaching and administrative roles. TCUs provide services to help students stay in school and complete their studies, such as personal and career counseling, mentoring, tutoring, wellness programs, child care, computer lending programs, and transportation and housing assistance. They also provide services to the wider community they serve and offer health centers, lending libraries, computer centers, and lifelong learning programs. TCUs at a glance * In 2016 there were 37 TCUs serving more than 17,000 Native students enrolled in academic programs; * TCUs operate more than 75 campuses in 16 states and serve students from more than 230 federally recognized Indian tribes. * TCUs must meet the same academic standards as other colleges and universities; * Native culture and language are infused throughout curriculum; * Non-Natives can also attend TCUs; * TCUs are competitive. Leech Lake Tribal College was ranked by Washington Monthly as the seventh of \\"America's 50 Best Community Colleges\\" in 2010. It was one of two TCUs to earn this recognition. * TCUs contribute to the economies of their communities. According to a report by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium in 2015, TCUs' economic impact was approximately equal to the creation of 28,778 jobs. Public service announcement The American Indian College Fund has continued its partnership with Portland, Oregon-based advertising agency partner, Wieden+Kennedy for more than 20 years to educate the public through a series of public service announcements to show the difference a higher education makes in American Indian communities. In 2015 they launched a campaign called 1%, to bring attention to the fact that only 1% of college students in the United States are American Indians. The campaign consists of print and video public service announcements. Wieden+Kennedy is known for its award-winning work for clients such as Nike and Coca-Cola. The College Fund's public service announcements have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Harper's, U.S. News and World Report, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Comcast, MSNBC, Discovery Networks, and National Geographic channel.

Licensed to the University of Oregon, it serves the Eugene/Springfield metropolitan area and has a live online stream. KWVA primarily plays a varied mix of music, in addition talk shows and live college sports broadcasts. KWVA regularly broadcasts a variety of locally produced and syndicated news programs including Democracy Now!, broadcast every weekday morning from 7:00‚Äì8:00 am, Health Matters broadcast Mondays 7:00pm‚Äì7:30pm, Anarchy Hour broadcast Tuesdays 7:00pm‚Äì7:30pm, and Occupy Radio broadcast Wednesdays 7:00pm‚Äì7:30pm. KWVA regularly broadcasts University of Oregon athletics played in Eugene, including football, softball, volleyball and women's soccer. KWVA Sports also calls local high school football and basketball games. KWVA is wholly student- operated and owned, though community members not affiliated with the University of Oregon can volunteer to be on-air DJs. Since Winter 2009, KWVA has kept up-to-date playlists of every show aired in the online database Spinitron. History KWVA began broadcasting in 1993. But the start of student radio at the University of Oregon began long before. Students and faculty worked together in the operation of KWAX, which was operated out of the UO Department of Speech. It served as an academic laboratory providing daily services for the campus and community from studios in Villard Hall. In the 1970s, KWAX affiliated with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, hired a dedicated professional staff and affiliated with NPR. Two years later, the university cut its academic ties with the station and by the early 1980s there were no students involved at KWAX. KWAX moved off campus and turned into the classical music station that it continues to be today. In the late 1980s, a group of students decided to start a new student radio station. Gary Rosenstein and James January spent months collecting the necessary 1,800 signatures to get the student government to bring the student station up for a vote. During this time KWAX was applying for a construction permit for a new facility broadcasting at 88.1FM on an existing antenna at Blanton Heights in South Eugene. Mr. January struck a deal with KWAX. KWAX would operate children's programming from 9 am ‚Äì 2 pm and UO students would broadcast for the remainder of the day. The new student station was to be called KRMA, for Real Music Alternative. Studio equipment was donated, thus reducing the start- up costs and allowing on other costs such as construction, production equipment and a microwave link to the Blanton Heights tower. Estimated cost was to be $25,000. On April 27, 1990, following a student body vote, the ASUO senate granted funding for a new mixed format student radio station, a total of $25,861 to cover the costs of construction and first year of operation. The measure was passed by more than four to one and students anticipated tuning into the station when they returned to campus the next fall. Due to FCC objections, namely interference due to antenna position, KWAX reconsidered its second service thus allowing KRMA to move ahead with university approval. An amended application was submitted in April 1992 proposing a name change to KWVA and a relocation of the antenna to the roof of Prince Lucien Campbell Hall, the highest building on the University of Oregon campus. On May 27, 1993 at 1:32 pm, KWVA broadcast its first song, \\"Hey Mr. DJ\\" by They Might Be Giants. It took nearly three years for January and Rosenstein to see fruitful efforts, and by that time they had both graduated. In June 1992, Michael Lovelady replaced January as the station manager and Alyssa Jenson took over for Lovelady in 1993. In 2006, KWVA hired its first full-time station manager Charlotte Nisser. Nisser was a student volunteer at KWVA while in undergraduate studies at the UO and accepted the full-time position while in grad school. In February 2008, KWVA received FCC approval for a construction permit to relocate the KWVA transmitter from the top of Prince Lucien Campbell Hall to Goodpasture Island Road and increase signal strength from 500 watts to 1,000 watts. KWVA requested funding from the ASUO to pay for the one-time installation and equipment expense to make this upgrade and relocation. Funding was approved and installation was successful, upgrading KWVA with modern broadcasting capabilities and vastly increasing its potential listenership to include all of Eugene/Springfield and surrounding areas. On June 20, 2016, KWVA moved from the EMU Suite M-112 (a former women's restroom for an on-air studio) to the renovated EMU Basement Suite 45. A special on air program was compiled by then current and alumni volunteers and staff. From 8am-9:30am a Goodbye show was broadcast, followed by symbolic dead air from 9:30am-10am, and a return to the air with a Hello and New Beginnings show from 10am-noon. The same first song, 'Hey Mr DJ' by They Might Be Giants, was broadcast upon return to the air. Staff and volunteers spent the day relocating the contents of Studio A (the women's restroom on-air studio) to the new radio station, most of the contents of the station (main office, equipment, student office) had been moved the week prior when professional moving help was provided by the EMU. The move to new space was part of an overall EMU renovation and new construction, coming in at $95 million for the entire building. The new radio facility was designed specifically for KWVA by General Manager Charlotte Nisser, with input from and many students and volunteers over a several year period. Suite 45 is about 3x the size of the original KWVA in Suite M-112. KWVA isn't sure if the allocation of 'Suite 45' was intentional by the building naming committee, but it feels appropriate that the radio station would get that number. And the on-air studios (of which there are two) are 45A and 45B, which also feel appropriate. Even during the 2020 Covid-19 crisis, KWVA is continuing to broadcast. KWVA DJs are producing shows from their homes and station staff are plugging them into the computer system to play, trying to keep the schedule as consistent as possible! Awards and recognition In 2005 and 2010, DJ Reverend Marc Time's \\"The Sunday Morning Hangover\\" was recognized by the Eugene Weekly as having the best radio program in Eugene. In 2009 and 2011, he again placed in the top three. In 2011, Music Director Thor Slaughter won two CMJ radio awards, Best Newcomer (in recognition of his first six months as music director) and Least Likely to Sell Out. In 2014, KWVA won 2 awards and was a finalist for 3 others from the College Broadcasters, Inc.

The school was initially planned to be an academy offering not only high school programs, but also more advanced academics. The initial plan was to rotate the academy between the towns of Cowley, Lovell, and Byron. However, the school never moved beyond Cowley, so the church decided to build a permanent building. The main building, of rusticated sandstone, was completed in 1916. It operated as a church school until 1924, when it became part of the public school system. A gymnasium, built of lodgepole pine, was added in 1936, being built by the Works Progress Administration. The school building was used until 1985. At that time the students from Cowley High School began attending Rocky Mountain High School in Byron. Between 1985 and 2011 it was used as a preschool, and housed a number of small businesses.

Time in New Zealand Ali entered New Zealand in February 2006 on a student visa, saying his dream was to become a commercial airline pilot and that he needed an English language qualification to assist. He then moved to Auckland to learn English and then moved to Palmerston North to fly at the Manawatu Aero Club. He told the Palmerston North flight school that he had obtained his private pilot's certificate in the United States and spent several years there before returning to Saudi Arabia to work in his father's textile business. He wanted to pass the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam so he could return home to train for his commercial pilot's licence. On May 29, 2006, New Zealand authorities raided Ali's Palmerston North home, and on May 30 he was deported back to Saudi Arabia under escort. On June 10, 2006 the New Zealand government released a statement saying that Ali was deported because he \\"posed a threat to national security\\" and confirmed that he had lived and trained in Phoenix, Arizona, USA with fellow Saudi Hani Hanjour in the months leading up to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Section 72 It was only the second time that section 72 of the New Zealand Immigration Act has been used to deport someone. Its use requires the consent of the Governor-General, and there is no right of appeal. It was used for the deportation of Soviet spy Anvar Kadyrov, a former KGB operative who was apprehended by New Zealand authorities in 1991 while attempting to obtain a New Zealand passport using a copy of a birth certificate of a deceased. Section 72 provides that where the Immigration Minister certifies that the continued presence in New Zealand of a person constitutes a threat to national security, the Governor-General may, by order in council, order that person's deportation. New Zealand Police seized Ali's flight logbook from the flight school, where he had flown several times in a Cessna aircraft accompanied by the flight school instructors. Immigration authorities also stated that Ali used a variation of his name when entering the country. In 2004, the Arizona Daily Star reported him as Rayed Mohammed Abdullah. Rayed Ali's Connections New Zealand Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said that Ali \\"was directly associated with persons responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001\\" He also quoted excerpts from the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission Report on the attacks regarding Rayed Mohammed Abdullah Ali. The report says Ali lived and trained in Phoenix, Arizona with Hani Hanjour, the Saudi Arabian believed to have piloted Flight 77 into the Pentagon, on September 11, 2001. Abdullah was a leader at the Islamic Cultural Centre in Phoenix where, the FBI says, he \\"reportedly gave extremist speeches at the mosque\\". Immigration Minister David Cunliffe also said that he could not comment on what happened after Ali returned to Saudi Arabia nor could he comment on what information he had on him or where it came from. \\"We're satisfied he is the right man.\\" The 9/11 Commission Report also says Abdullah attended the same Phoenix flight school as Hanjour and records show the pair used a flight simulator together on June 23, 2001. Flight instructors at the Manawatu Aero Club say Ali wore a baseball cap, smart shirts and baggy trousers and favoured burgers and fries over halal food. One of the instructors, Captain Singh, a former Indian Air Force officer trained in intelligence, who accompanied Ali on several flights in a Cessna 152 aircraft, says Ali had a Yemeni passport and he was naturally suspicious at first. \\"At the time of September 11 he would have been in the US. I asked him some very direct questions about his US flying experience and found he was quite intelligent and a moderate person. He was not at all fundamentalist - he was against those people.\\" \\"I found his standard to be very good\\", \\"He wanted to fly in Saudi Arabia or the [Arab] Emirates and was doing instrument training in the US before September 11 but said that since then everyone had treated him suspiciously. I'm 99 per cent sure he was genuine.\\" Ali told Captain Singh he was born and raised in Saudi Arabia but travelled on a Yemeni passport because his father was from Yemen and Saudi Arabia had refused to give him citizenship. When he returned to Palmerston North, he told Captain Singh he had missed an application deadline and been unable to sit the IELTS exam in Auckland. He planned to re-apply in Palmerston North for the IELTS course, where it was cheaper to fly than in Auckland. The Tip Off On July 13, 2006, the New Zealand Herald newspaper reported that New Zealand's security agencies discovered the identity of Rayed Mohammad Abdullah Ali after a tip off from Ardmore Flying School, which is approximately 20 kilometres south of Auckland City. The New Zealand Herald reported: \\"A month later, on April 12, Ali visited Ardmore Flying School and attempted to enrol in a flying course - an action which school general manager Craig Hunter believes may have been the beginning of the end of Ali's time in New Zealand. The school would not let Ali fly as he did not want to follow rules established to protect overseas student.\\" \\"He was not the least bit interested in complying with the rules, in terms of we would have made him pay a third of his total fee and he would have been granted an eight-month visa and we would have made him reapply for a student visa with the Ardmore Flying School as his training provider\\", the Herald reported. Prime Minister Helen Clark defended on her government's decision to deport Ali \\"When you have someone who clearly has been a close associate of a terrorist who took a plane into the Pentagon, it's clearly not useful to be providing them with pilot training in New Zealand\\".

Menaced by the Venetian colony of Negroponte and the Frankish Morea, he negotiated the handover of suzerainty to Frederick II of Sicily, who appointed his young son Manfred duke (1312). Frederick sent Berenguer Esta√±ol to act as Manfred's vicar general and Deslaur stepped down from his post as leader of the Company and duke of Athens, retiring to his castle at Salona, which he either escheated, or he was forced to relinquish, to Alfonso Fadrique around 1318.

In 2006, his songs and music videos about rural French life became an Internet phenomenon. Life and career The son of a doctor from Congo-Kinshasa, Kamini grew up in the French countryside in the small Picard village of Marly-Gomont, which inspired his hit single of the same name. After having received his Baccalaureat, Kamini left his hometown to settle in Lille, where he worked as a psychiatric nurse. In 2006, working with some friends, he wrote the song \\"Marly-Gomont\\", which is a humorous recounting of the daily life in the rural French town and the difficulty of being a member of the only black family in the village. His music video, sent to numerous music industry giants on September 12, 2006, greatly amused the company employees. The video was quickly put on air by French media, among them Fun Radio, Contact FM in New Zealand and the high-end social networking service, Skyrock. Kamini also appeared on numerous prestigious French television programs, such as le Journal de Jean-Pierre Pernaut, Le Grand Journal de Canal+, Cauet, Laurent Ruquier, and Direct 8. In mid-October, without having toured or even played a single gig, Kamini signed a record deal with RCA for Marly-Gomont and two albums. On December 1, 2006, Kamini appeared on the French show Star Academy, a French version of American Idol. He was profiled in December 2006 by Time magazine as part of its Person of the Year articles on Internet-based content creators. The video has received almost 4 million hits since it was posted on the YouTube website in September 2006. Because of his huge success and instant attachment amongst the French for his sound, dubbed the \\"rural rapper\\", Kamini was financially able to quit his nursing jobs. He conceived the idea for, and co-wrote the comedy-drama film The African Doctor (Bienvenue √† Marly-Gomont), which was released in 2016. The film, set in 1975, is inspired by the life of his father (originally from Zaire) as a doctor in Picardy a rural part of France. The film mostly focuses on the difficulty in integration faced by the doctor and his family.

In his advocacy of full checks and balances of Cabinet government that take time to work through policies, he deplored the messianic qualities of the Blair administration and a tendency towards authoritarianism that catapulted Britain into desert wars in the middle east and came to dominate the agenda. Donoughue was a partisan of the Wilson and Callaghan era, in which he started a political career, who he claimed were real Labour people; the contrast with Blair's aloofness towards real people he believed was detrimental to the democratic processes of Whitehall governance.

Invalid Corps troops also wore standard dark blue fatigue blouses from time to time. Standard forage caps were to be decorated with the brass infantry horn, regimental number, and company letter. Officers also wore sky blue; a frock coat of sky-blue cloth, with dark blue velvet collar and cuffs, in all other respects according to the present pattern for officers of infantry. Shoulder straps were also to match current patterns but dark-blue velvet. Officers also wore gold epaulets on parade. Eventually officers were allowed to wear the standard dark-blue frock, ostensibly because sky-blue frocks soiled easily. Some officers had their frocks cut down to make uniforms or shell jackets. By the war's end, however, the army was still making sky-blue officers' frocks. Organization There were twenty-four regiments in the Corps.Veteran Reserve Corps Civil War Union Units, 1st through 24th These regiments were organized into one division and three brigades.

In the beginning, each regiment was made up of six companies of the First Battalion and four of the Second Battalion, but in the latter part of the war, this method of organization was not strictly adhered to. The 18th Regiment, for example, which rendered exceptionally good service in Virginia at Belle Plain, Port Royal, and White House Landing in the spring and early summer of 1864, and in or near Washington DC in the latter part of the summer and through the fall of that year, was made up of only six Second Battalion companies. There were from two to three times as many men in the First Battalion as in the Second, and the soldiers in the First Battalion performed a wide variety of duties. They furnished guards for the Union prison camps at Johnson's Island, Ohio, Elmira, New York, Point Lookout, Maryland, and elsewhere. They furnished details to the provost marshals to arrest bounty jumpers and to enforce the draft. They escorted substitutes, recruits, and prisoners to and from the front. They guarded railroads, did patrol duty in Washington DC, and even manned the defenses of the city during Jubal Early's raid against Fort Stevens in July 1864. During the war, more than 60,000 men served in the Corps in the Union army;Wagner, Margaret E., Gary W. Gallagher, and Paul Finkelman. The Library of Congress Civil War Desk Reference.

Several thousand also served in a Confederate counterpart, the Southern Invalid Corps, although it was never officially organized into actual battalions. Four members from Company F of the Fourteenth Veteran Reserves conducted the execution of the four conspirators linked to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. They knocked out the post that released the platform that hanged Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt. The Federal corps was mostly disbanded in 1866 following the close of the Civil War and the lessening of a need for reserve troops. The reorganization of the Regular Army in July 1866 provided for four regiments of the Veteran Reserve Corps. The Veteran Reserve Corps completely ceased to exist when these regiments were consolidated with other regiments in the Army's next re-organization in March 1869.Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army, 1789‚Äì1903.

The supporting cast sometimes included Betty Lou Gerson, Elaine Burke, Bob Holden, Herb Butterfield, Irvin Lee and Herb Rawlinson. Other personnel Harry Zimmerman provided the background music. Nat Wolff directed the scripts by Richard Breen, Herb Margolis and Lou Markheim. The program's announcer was Tony LaFranco. See also Pat Novak, for Hire References Winn, Dilys.

The first model, Strida 1, was released in 1987 and the latest, Strida 5.2, in 2009. Advantages The Strida folds into a \\"wheeled walking-stick\\" that can be pushed along, much like a folded pram/baby-buggy whose folding concept provided the inspiration for the design. Other notable characteristics include: * a greaseless kevlar belt that replaces the traditional chain drive to avoid mess (see belt-driven bicycle) * minimalist design (single speed, aluminium-triangle frame, etc.) * low-maintenance brakes (drum brakes on the Strida 1, 2 and 3; disc brakes on the Strida 5 and later versions) * 16-inch wheels, upgradable to 18-inch wheels. Disadvantages The single sided wheel mountings and belt drive make fitting gears (e.g. d√©railleur or hub gears) more difficult than on chain driven bikes with conventional forks. The use of front mounted Schlumpf gear gets round this problem.

History The Strida was the major project for Mark Sanders's master's degree 1983 to 1985 at Imperial College London, and Royal College of Art. The course, IDE, (Industrial Design Engineering, now called Innovation Design Engineering) was a joint course by both institutions for engineering graduates to specialise in combining creative engineering with creative industrial design. The project is recorded in detail in the master's degree thesis. The aim of the project was to simplify bicycles and especially folding bicycles. It was inspired by the Maclaren baby buggy which folds into a thin form, with its wheels together at the end, so that can be rolled instead of being carried. In 1985, Industrial Property Rights Ltd, (run by James Marshall, former manager of golfer Greg Norman) licensed the design. The name 'Strida' was suggested by the 8-year-old son of one of the company directors; this was adopted as it was preferred to the suggestion 'Blake' by a PR consultancy. Production of the Strida 1 started in 1986, originally in Springburn, Glasgow. The Strida was launched in Harrods, London in 1987. Approximately 3,000 Strida 1s were made in Glasgow - these can be recognised by a welded steel rack, later replaced by a nylon injection moulded rack, which latter remains in production. In 1988, production moved to Long Eaton in Nottingham (near the Raleigh Bicycle Company factory, which by then was in decline). Sturmey-Archer developed a 2-speed, front-mounted gear which was prototyped and tested but never made in production. The Strida won all three UK Cyclex Bicycle Innovation Awards in 1988 (Best New Product, Most Innovative, Best British Design). Approximately 17,000 Strida 1s were made in Nottingham. Most were sold in Japan and UK, with smaller quantities in USA, Australia and Germany. In 1991, production moved to Casa Hipolito, a Portuguese Manufacturer. At this time Strida Ltd. was developing a baby buggy as a second product. By 1992, 25,000 Strida 1s had been produced. In 1993, the British Technology Group BTG, a company that licenses and commercializes medical innovations and other UK technology, controlled the rights to Strida until 1995. In 1997, Roland Plastics, a UK firm, purchased the rights to produce Strida and moved production back to Wickham market in the UK. It released the Strida 2 a year later. In 2000, the Strida won I.D. Magazine‚Äôs Annual Design Award, Sail Magazine‚Äôs Pittman Award for Innovation and Safety, and the British Design Council Millennium product Award. Steedman Bass, of Boston USA, purchased the rights to produce the Strida. With Mark Sanders, Bass began development of the Strida 3 as described by The Open University course 'Design and designing' (T211). In 2002, in order to meet increased demand, Bass moved production to Taiwanese manufacturer Ming Cycle. Strida 3 was launched, with an inaugural shipment of 2000 units to Italy. Ming began to establish distributorships in Korea, Japan, Netherlands, France and the U.S.A. Development of the Strida 5 started. In May 2003, The Daily Mail newspaper ran an article that pictured Viscount Linley riding a Strida 3. In March 2006, Ming Cycle took over ownership of Strida rights. In November 2006, a Strida 3 was featured on the UK television programme The Gadget Show, alongside the Sinclair A-Bike. In 2007 the Strida 5 won a design award at the Taipei International Bike Show. A 2-speed gear option was added in 2009, based on the cableless, Schlumpf front crank operated epicyclic gearbox.http://www.schlumpf.ch/hp/sd/sd_engl_technische_daten.htm The Strida 5 includes an upgrade kit of the Strida 3, and adds disc brakes, eccentric belt tensioner, metal spoked wheels and high pressure tyres. Series The Strida is made by Ming Cycle in Taiwan. There was a key patent which covered the early Strida 1 onwards. The U.S. version of this patent was filed in 1986https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=XE4wAAAAEBAJ&dq;=4718688 and expired in 2006,http://www.freepatentsonline.com/help/item/When-does-a-patent- expire.html which means only the mechanism used in Strida 1 and 2 of the product is now in the public domain.

Often erroneously described as a traditional MƒÅori song,\\"Music: Now Is the Hour\\", Time Magazine, January 19, 1948 its creation is usually credited to several people, including Clement Scott (music), and Maewa Kaihau and Dorothy Stewart (arrangement and lyrics). History The tune of the song first became known in 1913 when it was published by W.H. Paling and Co as a piano-variations piece in Australia, called Swiss Cradle Song and credited to \\"Clement Scott\\". Some sources say that, after a tour of New Zealand, the British music critic and travel writer Clement Scott wrote the tune to the \\"Swiss Cradle Song\\".Scowcroft, Philip L. \\"A 206th Garland of British Composers\\", June 2001, MusicWeb International, accessed 1 May 2014 However, the family of an Australian, Albert Saunders, has long claimed that the \\"Clement Scott\\" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for Saunders.Smyth, Terry. \\"Unsung hero\\", The Sunday Star-Times, 13 December 2009, accessed 1 May 2014New Zealand Folk Song Site In any event, the piece consisted of eight variations to the main 16-bar theme. Paling sold 130,000 copies of Swiss Cradle Song.New Zealand History Web Site Australian composer Clarence Elkin also claimed to be the writer MƒÅori words were added around 1915 and the tune was slightly changed. It became known as Po Atarau and was used as a farewell to MƒÅori soldiers going to the First World War. After this, some white New Zealanders \\"mistakenly thought [the song was] an old Maori folksong\\". One claim attributes the first words to two MƒÅori groups of sheep shearers, the Grace and Awatere families, of Tuparoa. In 1920 Maewa Kaihau (friend to Ramai Hayward) wrote an opening verse in English as \\"This is the hour..\\" for her daughter who had become attached to a member of a visiting royal party, who was shortly to leave. She also modified the Po Atarau tune and added another MƒÅori translation. When it became popular, Maewa Kaihau claimed the words and tune as her own work, but then Paling asserted their copyright for the tune. Nevertheless, Maewa Kaihau's words were copyrighted in 1928. In 1935 Kaihau modified the Po Atarau version again to become the Haere Ra Waltz Song, which was performed as the last waltz at dances and farewells. The song was first recorded by Ana Hato in 1927 with minor variations in the lyrics. English singer, Gracie Fields, learnt Haere Ra on a visit to New Zealand in 1945 in Rotorua. While travelling in her car, her driver taught her a version of it and it became a world-wide hit in 1948. Fields's manager, Dorothy Stewart, is credited with amending the opening line to Now is the Hour, and with adding another verse. The tune, commonly named MAORI in hymnals, is also used with the lyrics \\"Search Me, O God\\" by J. Edwin Orr. MAORI at Hymnary.org. Other versions New Zealand Maori singers, Ken Kincaid and Deane Waretini have both recorded versions of the song. The version by Kincaid appears on the Mauri Hikitia album, and was also the B side of his single.National Library of New Zealand Catalogue The Mauri Hikitia albumNational Library of New Zealand Easy, arr. (and performed by) Ken Kincaid. Songs of home (Now is the hour) / trad. ; (performed by) Ken Kincaid. The version by Waretini is on his Now is the Hour album released in 2012.iTunes Now Is the Hour, Deane Waretini The song achieved world-wide popularity in 1948 when no less than seven recordings of the song reached the Billboard charts in the USA. These were by Bing Crosby (recorded November 8, 1947 with the Ken Darby Choir and Instrumental Group, No. 1 for three weeks during 23 weeks in the charts, and was also Crosby's 45th and final #1 hit of his career), Margaret Whiting (No. 2), Gracie Fields (No. 3), Buddy Clark (No. 6), Eddy Howard (No. 8), Kate Smith (No. 12), and Charlie Spivak (No. 14). Numerous other artists have subsequently recorded the song including Frank Sinatra, Gale Storm, Burl Ives, Connie Francis and the Everly Brothers. Hayley Westenra, a soprano from New Zealand, sang the song at the closing of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Sporting culture Newcastle United fans sang the song in the dying minutes of the 1955 FA Cup Final, to mean Now is the hour, we will lift the cup. However, the song didn't catch on as a terrace chant and was never taken up by other fans at later finals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvPwmuChBKo&t;=5226s Lyrics ;MƒÅori :P≈ç atarau e moea iho nei :E haere ana koe ki pƒÅmamao :Haere rƒÅ ka hoki mai an≈ç :Ki i te tau e tangi atu nei. ;English :Now is the hour for me to say goodbye :Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea :While you're away oh please remember me :When you return you'll find me waiting here References Category:1913 songs Category:Bing Crosby songs Category:Frank Sinatra songs Category:MƒÅori music Category:New Zealand folk songs Category:Songs written by Clement Scott ","title":"Now Is the Hour (song)"},{"id":"7956767","text":"Wolfgang Kaleck Wolfgang Kaleck (born 1960) is a German civil rights attorney.

Characters X-Men: Professor X, Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Rogue, Gambit, Jean Grey, Jubilee, Beast Supporting Characters Senator Robert Kelly, Magneto, Ghost Rider, Bella Donna, Bishop Villains: Master Mold, Bolivar Trask, Henry Peter Gyrich, Sentinels, Mister Sinister Synopsis This episode follows Days of Future Past, part 2. The episode begins with the X-Men watching anti-mutant protests, over the kidnapping of Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto has kidnapped the Senator and brought him over to a sunken ship to kill him, so that mutants and humans would go to war. As he tries to kill him, Sentinels come and badly injure Magneto, because he couldn't use his powers on the Sentinels, since they were made of plastic. Then the Sentinels take the senator. When the X-Men finally find where Magneto is, it's too late, the Sentinels are already gone with the Senator. They find Magneto under the rubble and take him to the X-Mansion. The Sentinels take Senator Kelly to Master Mold. Bolivar Trask had sent them to bring the senator. In return of saving him, Trask wants Kelly to pass a presidential order putting Sentinels in-charge of controlling mutants. Trask asks the Sentinels to return the Senator to his campaign headquarters, but the Sentinels refuse. Master Mold wants to replace all the world leaders' brains with computers, so that Sentinels could control the world, with Kelly being the first. Confused, Trask reminds Master Mold that he and the other Sentinels were programmed to only hunt and control the mutant population, not the humans, but is shocked when Master Mold reminds him that mutants are humans; therefore, logically, humanity must be protected from themselves, regardless if they have mutant powers or not. Trask, initially believing Master Mold to be mistaken, tries to reason with the robot, but as the accurate and irrefutable truth of Master Mold's words starts to sink in, he realizes that he's created an even more dangerous threat than the mutants he created them to hunt. Gambit had seen the man in charge of the Sentinels in Genosha, so they find out who he is to find out where the Sentinel base is. They find that his name is Henry Peter Gyrich. Then they find Gyrich and get the location of Sentinels' base. Then the X-Men go to the base to rescue Kelly. When they get to the base, Master Mold activates all the sentinels and they attack. Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit, and Jean Grey go underground to defeat Master Mold, while the others fight the Sentinels above ground. Later Magneto also comes to help the X-Men. Jean Grey and Cyclops find Master Mold, and Trask blows up a propane gas line near Master Mold. The whole mine starts blowing up and the X-Men escape with Kelly and Trask. All the Sentinels go to help Master Mold. Then the mine blows up, destroying all the Sentinels. But master Mold survives, so Professor X rams an X-Jet filled with explosives into Master Mold. Xavier parachutes out and Master Mold is destroyed. Later, Senator Kelly helps Beast be released. Almost at the same time, Cyclops proposes to his girlfriend Jean Grey, who accepts. Sinister is shown watching Cyclops and Jean's happiness on a monitor and laughing. Production The first season order was 13, standard for a network show. The Sentinel story wrapped up at this episode, and that was because the writers weren't sure that there would be more than 13. Looking back at the previous Marvel animated adaptations, there was great fear that X-Men would fail. When the first season became a #1 hit, the network ordered 39 more episodes.

Licensed to the city of Eugene, Oregon, it serves the Eugene-Springfield media market. KUGN partners with local CBS television affiliate KVAL Channel 13 for breaking news and weather coverage. National news is supplied by Westwood One News, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media. KUGN broadcasts with 5000 watts, around the clock. By day, the signal is non- directional. But at night, KUGN uses a directional antenna to protect other stations on 590 kHz. The transmitter is located in Eugene off North Game Farm Road and KUGN's studios and offices are on Executive Parkway.http://radio- locator.com/cgi-bin/finder?call=kugn&x;=0&y;=0&sr;=Y&s;=C Listeners in the Springfield area can also receive KUGN programming on 102.9 MHz over K275AA, an FM translator.http://radio-locator.com/info/K275AA-FX KUGN has a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission to increase the translator's power to 250 watts from its current 35 watts. The improved power will cover Eugene, Springfield and the close-in suburbs. Programming On weekdays, KUGN carries nationally syndicated radio shows.

Some weekday shows are repeated and some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. =Sports= KUGN is the flagship radio station of the Oregon Sports Network, and broadcasts University of Oregon football and basketball games, which are simulcast on co-owned sports radio station KUJZ 95.3 FM. History KUGN first signed on the air on July 4, 1946, as the second radio station in Eugene, after KORE. KUGN was originally affiliated with the ABC radio network, but switched to NBC in December 1952. The station dropped the longtime NBC affiliation for CBS in December 1977. In 1953, KUGN raised its power to 5,000 watts, to become the most powerful radio station in Oregon, outside the Portland metropolitan area.Register Guard, November 16, 1953 In 1979, KUGN began airing some Mutual Broadcasting System programming, including Monday Night Football and Larry King's popular late night talk show. During its first four decades, KUGN was best known for its eclectic, personable announcers. The careers of such veterans as Duke Young, Dick Cross, Dave Miller, Russ Doran, Skip Hathaway, Webb Russell, Wendy Ray and Dale \\"Uncle Fuzzy\\" Reed spanned the period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. The station had the first traffic reports in the market in 1976 when Ken Strobeck did morning and afternoon drive-time reports in the \\"KUGN Traffic Rabbit,\\" a Volkswagen Rabbit equipped with a radio telephone and portable transmitter. Tom Lichty (\\"Major Tom\\") took over the job in late 1976 when traffic reporting took flight, serving both as traffic reporter and pilot. The \\"old\\" KUGN, which Ray called \\"the best radio station in the world,\\" is remembered for its popular \\"Morning Show.\\" Reed teamed with Ray and news director Fred Webb for a popular program that was a \\"must hear\\" in the Eugene area throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. \\"The Morning Show\\" entertained listeners with such lighthearted features such as Ray's \\"Ball Score Boogie,\\" the \\"Poet's Nook\\" starring Webb as the high-buttoned poetry devotee \\"Charles,\\" Lichty's traffic reports, and \\"Gridpute,\\" a tongue-in-cheek Friday morning football preview featuring Ray and a clanking, cantankerous \\"computer.\\" Ray and Webb also teamed up on the morning newscasts, twice hourly between 5:30 and 10 a.m. D.J.-anchor \\"Uncle Fuzzy\\" knit it all together with his wry commentary and savvy music choices (adult contemporary music with a fair amount of jazz). Ray retired from radio in March 1992. Reed and Webb continued until that November, but management chose not to renew their contracts.Register Guard, November 10, 1992 The station experimented with a few replacements, before settling on a morning news team of Ralph Steadman and Rick Little. Steadman exited in 1995 to make way for University of Oregon sportscaster Jerry Allen.Register Guard, September 2, 1995 Then in 2016, KUGN began carrying Armstrong & Getty, based at KSTE in Sacramento. =Ownership= KUGN-AM was founded in 1946 by C.H. Fisher of Portland. After some years, his children - Carl Fisher, Jane Whitbread, and Nancy Harrison - assumed daily operations of the station. In 1972 Obie Advertising bought KUGN from the Fishers. Obie was headed by Brian Obie, a future mayor of Eugene.Register Guard, August 4, 1972 Obie Advertising sold KUGN to Dallas-based Media Corp. of America in 1987. Then in mid-1989, long-time employees Jim Torrey (also a future mayor of Eugene) and Chuck Chackel purchased KUGN for $4.2 million.Register Guard, June 8, 1989 The new company was called Combined Communications. Torrey sold his interest in the company in 1991.Register Guard, April 8, 1997 In 1996, the Federal Communications Commission changed radio station ownership rules to allow companies to own up to six stations in a market (see Telecommunications Act of 1996). Prior to 1996, companies could only own two FM and two AM stations per market. Combined Communications took advantage of the new ownership rules and sold the station in 1996 to Deschutes Broadcasting for $7 million. Over the next three years, the station passed hands from Deschutes to Citadel Broadcasting to Marathon Media, and finally, to Cumulus Broadcasting. Cumulus also purchased five other stations in the Eugene area. =\\"Home of the Ducks\\"= In 1957, KUGN became the first flagship station of the University of Oregon sports radio network, with play-by-play announcer John Tasnady serving five seasons as the football \\"Voice of the Ducks.\\" KUGN morning host Wendy Ray, already a veteran sportscaster, took the microphone in 1960 as the Ducks' basketball announcer, when KUGN got the broadcast rights to that sport from local rival KASH. When Tasnady retired from broadcasting prior to the 1962 football season, Ray stepped in as football announcer, and called both sports up through the 1969 Oregon-Oregon State \\"Civil War\\" football game. Color commentator Mike Guldager stepped in as play-by-play announcer for the season finale at Hawaii, and then announced Ducks basketball and football until 1973. Ray returned to Oregon Ducks play-by-play for one season (1974‚Äì75) as football and basketball announcer. He also served as color commentator for new play-by- play announcer Warren Swain in the 1980 football season. Outside radio, Ray was the longtime public address announcer for Oregon track and field meets at Hayward Field. Other KUGN \\"voices\\" of University of Oregon sports were Bud Sobel (1973‚Äì74), Ralph Petti (football, 1975), Mike Stone (1975‚Äì80), Swain (1980‚Äì82), Portland sportscaster Bill Johnson (1982‚Äì84) and Hal Ramey (1984‚Äì87). KUGN lost the broadcast rights to Duck sports in 1987, when the University of Oregon athletic department set up its own in-house radio network. The university put the network's flagship status up for bidding, and local rival KPNW won out over KUGN.Register Guard, December 12, 1989 During that time, KUGN became the flagship station for the Oregon State Beavers football radio network, outbidding Portland station KEX-AM.Register Guard, May 3, 1987 Eight years later, KUGN regained the broadcast rights to Duck sports. Play-by-play announcer Jerry Allen moved from KPNW to KUGN at that time. Today Ducks' broadcasts are shared with co-owned sports radio station KUJZ 95.3 FM.

The Sharifian movement on which the Saadi Dynasty was to be built began when Abu Abdallah, during a visit to Medina, dreamed of two lions entering a tower with a crowd of people close behind. Taking his vision to a Sufi sheikh, he was told that his two sons would have an important future in his country.An- Nasiri, Kitab al-Istiqsa, Les Saadiens, p. 12 Upon returning to Morocco he began to broadcast the vision among his people, who believed him, according to Moroccan historian al-Nasiri, because of his reputation for honesty, and he adopted the Mahdist title \\"al-Qaim bi Amrillah\\" (the one called by God). After meeting with the leaders of the Masmuda Berbers at Tidsi near the town of Taroudannt, Abu Abdallah al-Qaim agreed to lead the jihad against the Portuguese at Agadir and other towns along the southern coast. He then sent his two sons Ahmad al-Araj and Mohammed Amghar (later called Mohammed ash- Sheikh) to Fez, where they established themselves as teachers of religion and literature and exhorted the sultan to raise a full jihad in the south.An- Nasiri, Kitab al-Istiqsa, Les Saadiens, pp. 16-17 The Wattasid sultan Abu Abdallah al Burtugali gave them full permission to carry out their jihad in the Sous. This enabled the Saadians to transform their moral authority into a military authority. After they had forced the Portuguese out of their coastal positions, they took the power in Marrakech.

In the 1980s he was a member of Members Only, a jazz ensemble who recorded for Muse Records.[ Allmusic] Soloff was a regular member and sub-leader of Gil Evans' Monday Night Orchestra, started from 1983, and trained his ability as band leader. His debut album recording was supported by Gil. His 2010 recording Sketches of Spain is a tribute to the classic 1959-60 Miles Davis-Gil Evans collaboration, and he has performed the equally legendary and prodigiously difficult (reconstructed) Evans arrangements of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. Soloff was also a longtime member of the Manhattan Jazz Quintet and Mingus Big Band. Soloff made frequent guest appearances with jazz orchestras all over the world such as the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (directed by Wynton Marsalis) and the Magic City Jazz Orchestra (directed by Ray Reach). He was among a handful of trumpeters capable of playing demanding lead trumpet parts while also contributing improvisational solos, and of playing (as musicians refer to it) \\"legitimate\\" music (baroque, classical, and later orchestral and chamber music styles) making him an in-demand session player for commercials and soundtracks. Soloff died in 2015 after apparently suffering a heart attack in New York City.https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-lew- soloff-20150309-story.html Discography =As leader= *Air on a G String, 2003 - Larry Willis (piano), Francois Moutin (bass), Victor Lewis (drums) *Rainbow Mountain, 2000 - Lou Marini (saxophones, flute), Joe Beck (guitar), Mark Egan (bass), Danny Gottlieb (drums).

A defender, able to play at left-back or in the centre, Irwin came through the youth ranks at Liverpool, and his first call-up to the first-team squad came, remarkably, in the 1978 European Cup Final. Irwin did not get on the pitch, but Liverpool won the game, and Irwin collected a winners medal. He was not involved in the first-team squad at all in the 1978‚Äì79 season, but he made his debut early the following season, against West Bromwich Albion, and went on to make 14 appearances throughout the season. 1980‚Äì81 saw a revamp of Liverpool's squad, with many young players given their chance, of which Irwin was one. Although not an automatic first-team selection, he made 30 appearances and was a regular squad member as Liverpool won the League Cup and European Cup. However, the summer of 1981 saw Liverpool sign Mark Lawrenson, which made Irwin surplus to requirements. As had several players released by Liverpool, Irwin moved on to Swansea, managed by John Toshack, for ¬£340,000. This was the club's record transfer paid (although much of it was still owing when the club went bankrupt in 1984), until 2008 when they paid ¬£400,000 for Ashley Williams. He was made captain, but suffered a knee injury in 1983 which forced him to retire. Following retirement, he served as a coach at Bolton Wanderers, under former teammate Phil Neal, from 1985 to 1987.

The only portion of SR 75 that is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense, is the entire length of the US 76/SR 2 concurrency. History The original southern terminus was at Georgia State Route 254 near the Mossy Creek and Skitt Mountain Golf Courses. This segment ran northwest into US 129/SR 11 and multiplexed with those routes until it reached Helen Way. Today, the segment between SR 254 and US 129 is named \\"Old Highway 75 South.\\" Major intersections Special routes =Cleveland spur= State Route 75 Spur (SR 75 Spur) was a spur route of SR 75 that was unsigned on Nacoochee Road and Old Nacoochee Road just south-southeast of SR 75's intersection with US 129/SR 11/SR 75 Alt. It began at an intersection with US 129/SR 11 (North Main Street) in the north-central part of the city of Cleveland. It traveled to the northeast. Just before an intersection with the southern terminus of Ash Street, it curved to the east-northeast. Just after an intersection with the northern terminus of Faulkner Street, it curved to the north-northeast. At an intersection with Woodman Hall Road, the name changed from Nacoochee Road to Old Nacoochee Road. It curved to the northwest and met its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 75 (Helen Highway). Between 1951 and 1960, SR 75 Spur was established. It was decommissioned between 1983 and 1992. =Cleveland alternate= State Route 75 Alternate (SR 75 Alt.) is an alternate route that exists entirely within the central part of White County. The southern part is within the city limits of Cleveland. It begins at an intersection with US 129/SR 11 (North Main Street), where they meet the southern terminus of the SR 75 mainline (Helen Highway) and the northern terminus of Wilford Ash Sr. Parkway in the north-central part of Cleveland. US 129/SR 11/SR 75 Alt. head northwest and leave the city. Just outside the city limits, they meet the northern terminus of US 129 Byp./SR 11 Byp. (Appalachian Parkway) and the southern terminus of SR 75 Conn. (Hulsey Road). A short distance to the northwest, SR 75 Alt. splits off to the north-northeast. Little over later, the road enters the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. It intersects the eastern terminus of SR 348 (Richard B. Russell Scenic Highway). The road continues to the north-northeast and meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 17/SR 75, just northwest of Helen. =White County connector route= State Route 75 Connector (SR 75 Conn.) is a connector for SR 75 that connects US 129/SR 11 and US 129 Byp./SR 11 Byp. with the SR 75 mainline. Its entire length is just north of the city. It is named Hulsey Road for its entire path. It begins at an intersection with US 129/SR 11 north- northwest of the city of Cleveland. Here, the roadway continues as US 129 Byp./SR 11 Byp. (Appalachian Parkway). It travels to the east-northeast. It curves to a more easterly direction and meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 75 (Helen Highway). Between the beginning of 2017 and the beginning of 2019, SR 75 Conn. was established.

In an extremely varied career, he is perhaps best known for his seminal books on angling, particularly salmon and sea trout fishing; however, he was also a noted filmmaker and broadcaster for the BBC. Biography Hugh Edward Lance Falkus was born to James Falkus, a Surrey bank manager, and his wife Alice Maud. James retired early to a boat, first on the Essex marshes and then in Devon, upon which Hugh was sent to the East Anglian School, in Suffolk. According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Hugh caught his first fish when he was four, learned to shoot when he was six, and was an expert helmsman by the age of fifteen. By eighteen he had learned to fly, and at twenty he became a pilot in the RAF. On 11 July 1939 he married Doris Marjorie Walter, and they had two sets of twins (three sons and a daughter). The youngest son, Anthony, born in 1952, died in infancy. The older twins, Christopher and Malcolm, born in 1940, had successful careers, Christopher becoming a prominent publisher while Malcolm's career has been in economic history. Falkus' only daughter, Rowena Mary, is a Benedictine nun. In June 1940 Falkus' Spitfire was shot down over France and he spent the rest of the war in German prison camps, including Stalag Luft III the Great Escape camp. After the war he left Doris and in 1950 he married Diana Vaughan, the young editor of Argosy magazine, but on 12 May 1951 Diana was drowned, along with Charles Osborne, Bill Brendon and Sam Lee, in a boating accident off the coast of Achill Island in County Mayo, Ireland, while they were making a film about the local shark hunting industry. Filming near the Daisy Rocks, a huge wave estimated to be 27 feet high capsized and sank the lifeboat being used for the filming. Falkus, a powerful swimmer, took command and ensure other members of the party including his wife were equipped with flotation devices; roping them together into a raft, and then set out for help. He collapsed unconscious having narrowly survived after swimming over a mile to the shore, before being able to tell his rescuers the location of the accident and its survivors. As efforts were made to revive him, rescue parties went to the wrong location, Achill Head, based on guesswork. Falkus immediately upon recovering consciousness told the correct location but by then it was too late and the others had died from cold. His wife's remains and one other person's were recovered. In 1952 Falkus married Lady Margaret Vane- Tempest-Stewart, second daughter of the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, but the marriage was short-lived. By 1955 Falkus had settled in Eskdale, Cumberland, which he had come to know and love through his friendship with Bill Fowler, a bomber pilot from Long Yocking, Eskdale, who he had met in a prisoner of war camp. In 1958 Falkus married Kathleen Armstrong, daughter of a local farming family. He lived with her at Cragg Cottage, Eskdale, for most of the rest of his life, writing about fishing and natural history and making television films on related subjects. He wrote, produced and presented a series of The World About Us films for the BBC, and with the Nobel Prize-winning zoologist Professor Niko Tinbergen he made a film about gull behaviour called Signals for Survival which won the Italia prize in 1969, and first prize for the BBC at the 1969 Montreux Film Festival. He was reportedly and according to his biographer, Chris Newton, a sexual predator, gaining the punning nickname \\"Huge Phallus\\" at the BBC. He was still having affairs in his late sixties, upsetting his friends by deserting Kathleen, his wife of 25 years for a woman named Romille. Falkus' masterwork Sea Trout Fishing, A Practical Guide (HF & G Witherby 1962, enlarged edition 1975) became a best-seller and has never been out of print; it \\"established his reputation as the father of modern sea-trout fishing\\" according to his biographer, Chris Newton. It was followed in 1984 by Salmon Fishing, a Practical Guide, also a best-seller which remains in print. Falkus was a controversial and outspoken figure, insisting on being right and bullying people. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1982. Hugh Falkus died of cancer and bronchopneumonia at Cragg Cottage on 30 March 1996. His son Christopher had predeceased him, dying in 1995 of heart disease.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-christopher- falkus-1613740.html Works Falkus's works include: =Films= * The Signreaders, 1964 * Signals for Survival, 1968, with Niko Tinbergen * The Riddle of the Rook, 1973 * Tender Trap, 1974 * Self-Portrait of a Happy Man, 1976 * Salmo the Leaper, 1977 * Highland Story, 1979 =Books= * Sea Trout Fishing, 1962 * The Stolen Years - Memories of a Country Boyhood, 1965 * Signals for Survival, 1994 (with Niko Tinbergen) * Freshwater Fishing, 1975 (with Fred Buller) * Nature Detective, 1978 * Salmon Fishing, 1984 * Falkus & Buller's Freshwater Fishing, 1992 * Speycasting - A New Technique, 1994 * The Salmon and Sea Trout Fisher's Handbook, 1994 (With Malcolm Greenhalgh) * Some of it was Fun, 2003  References  Further reading * Hugh Falkus: A Life on the Edge, a biography of Hugh Falkus by Chris Newton, was published in December 2007 by Medlar Press.

It takes its name (\\"Bridge of the Tits\\") from the use of the bridge by prostitutes, who were encouraged to stand topless on the bridge and in nearby windows to entice and convert suspected homosexuals. History The Serenissima restricted prostitution in Venice to the area Carampane di Rialto by official decree in 1412. The prostitutes were severely restricted in their movement and behaviour. The buildings of the area had become property of the Serenissima when the last of the rich Rampani family had died without an heir. A curfew was imposed on them, and they could not leave the area except on Saturdays, when they had to wear a yellow scarf, as opposed to the white scarf of a marriageable woman. They could not work on certain holy days, with transgression of the rules sometimes resulting in flogging. During the 16th century, the prostitutes faced strong competition from homosexuals and formally asked the Doge to help them. The authorities, keen to suppress homosexuality (which was perceived as a social problem), allowed the prostitutes to display their breasts from balconies and windows near the bridge to attract business. At night they were permitted to use lanterns to illuminate their breasts. To divert with such incentive the men from sin against nature the Serenissima also paid prostitutes to stand in a line across the bridge with breasts exposed. The display of breasts also served to exclude transvestite prostitutes. Taxes on prostitution imposed by the Serenissima in 1514, helped finance excavation at the Arsenale. One writer estimated that there were some 11,654 prostitutes working in Venice at that time. Nearby was the Traghetto Del Buso (Crossing Of The Hole), where prostitutes' clients crossed the Grand Canal to enter the red-light district. Casanova was said to be a frequent visitor. This situation continued until the 18th century when, to encourage tourism, younger prostitutes were allowed to work throughout in the city and older and less attractive prostitutes were restricted to the nearby Rio ter√† delle Carampane.

A subsidiary of the Watco Companies, the SLWC operates over of track in the state from Sapulpa through Oklahoma City through Lawton to Snyder and has trackage rights over BNSF from Sapulpa to Tulsa, and from Snyder to Long. SLWC operates a branch from Stillwater to a connection with BNSF at Pawnee. Its primary business is handling mined, mineral, and industrial products. History In July 1998, SLWC leased of rail line from the State of Oklahoma. This included both the line between Sapulpa (near Tulsa) and Del City (near Oklahoma City), known as the Sooner Sub, as well as a branch line from Stillwater to Pawnee (geographically separated from the other line leased). In January 2002, SLWC acquired from the BNSF, and began operating, of rail line from Wheatland (south of Oklahoma City) to Long. In January 2005, SLWC leased from BNSF a line from Wheatland to Oklahoma City. In January 2010, in conjunction with BNSF, the SLWC launched unit crude oil train service between the Bakken oil fields and a terminal in Oklahoma. In July 2014 SLWC agreed to purchase the Sooner Sub line from the State of Oklahoma, subject to approval by the Surface Transportation Board; the STB approved the transaction on July 29, 2014. The purchase contract reportedly included a requirement to start a six-month daily passenger service trial run over the line before August 2019, with a financial penalty for not meeting the deadline set at $2.8 million. The agreement also called for the state to retain the right to acquire a passenger rail easement should the company decide not to operate such a service after 10 years. Finally, the agreement required the line to be accessible to other rail companies, and for the SLWC to upgrade the line from Class II to Class III, to enable trains to safely travel at faster speeds. Class III permits freight traffic up to 40 mph and passenger traffic up to 60 mph. In June 2018, SLWC, being only a freight operator, issued a request for proposal to begin the process of securing a private rail carrier to provide the passenger service, locally known as the Eastern Flyer, for an initial period of 10 years, along the route between Sapulpa and Del City, but with the expectation of working with city officials to expand it to the downtowns of Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Government officials were not optimistic that the original August 2019 deadline would be met. On August 5, 2019, the Stillwater Central opted to default under the agreement and pay the contractual $2.8 million penalty for not establishing the service.

Background The social and political upheavals of the 1960s have been cited as a major factor in the emergence of a new stylistic trend in jazz, with a very different emphasis to the forms of the music which emerged earlier. Many of the artists involved in the making of this new music, variously called \\"free jazz\\", \\"the new thing\\", or \\"energy music\\", recorded for the Impulse! label. Ashley Kahn writes that several musicians, often those who had either played with or been influenced by John Coltrane, such as his widow Alice Coltrane, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, and Leon Thomas, began exploring new thematic and musical ideas, often associated with non-western religious and musical traditions.Ashley Kahn, The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records (2006), W. W. Norton, Although the ideological strain was much more obvious in Shepp's music than Sanders', the musical influence was just as pronounced: virtually all of his recordings as a leader from this late 1960s/early 1970s period contain some kind of African percussion, and other non-western features such as Leon Thomas' distinctive yodelling, apparently learnt from African pygmies. Album information Karma is Sanders' third recording as a leader, and is among a number of spiritually-themed albums released on the Impulse! record label in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Although it is followed by the brief \\"Colors\\", the album's 32-minute-long \\"The Creator Has a Master Plan\\", co- composed by Sanders with vocalist Leon Thomas. Some see this piece as a kind of sequel to Sanders' mentor John Coltrane's legendary 1964 recording A Love Supreme (whose opening it echoes in a muscular yet lyrical opening \\"prelude\\", with Sanders playing over a suspended, non-rhythmic backdrop, before the entrance of a bass figure which underpins much of the piece). It features Sanders on tenor sax, along with two of his most important collaborators, the aforementioned Leon Thomas and pianist Lonnie Liston Smith, as well as a supporting cast of musicians who were major musicians in their own right: flautist James Spaulding; French-horn player Julius Watkins; bassist Reggie Workman, who had played with Coltrane earlier in the 1960s; second bassist Richard Davis; drummer Billy Hart, and percussionist Nathaniel Bettis. While later recorded versions of the tune, some of which featured Sanders and Thomas, became shorter and more lyrical, this original contains extended free instrumental sections, particularly the third section, where the saxophonist demonstrates some of the techniques which build his distinctive sound, including a split-reed technique, overblowing, and multiphonics, which give a screeching sound. On the whole, however, this was quite laid-back and accessible for a free-jazz record (compared to, say, Coltrane's 1966 album Ascension), with its mantra-like chant/melody, accessible, loping groove (which has since been sampled and covered by other artists‚ÄîSanders himself re- uses it on \\"Heart Is a Melody of Time (Hikoro's Song)\\" from his album Heart is a Melody) and optimistic, spiritually-themed lyrics. The unusual textures also give an impression of the exotic, with the employment of a French horn and flute, adding an almost orchestral tinge not often found in jazz, as well as Leon Thomas' characteristic yodelling and a variety of percussion instruments.

He took the World Bantamweight Championship on April 1, 1957, in Paris, and the European Bantamweight Championship three years later. Early life He was born in Constantine, Algeria, to an Orthodox Jewish family. He was the last of 13 children, only seven of whom reached adulthood. His father was a postal inspector. At the age of 10, he ran away from home for the first time, living for long periods of time on the streets of a nation torn by war. A tailor named Dianoux, of Algiers, took Halimi under his wing and trained him to work as a tailor by the age of 12.Silver, Mike, \\"Stars in the Ring\\", (2016), Roman and Littelfield, Guilford, Connecticut, pg. 282-3 After he was caught in a fight on the streets of Algiers, Dianoux encouraged him to train at the Mouloudia gymnasium. Halimi was an excellent swimmer, but he chose boxing as his calling. He was Jewish, and sewed a star of David on his red and green (the Mouloudia colors) training shorts. Halimi's hero was the Algerian-born Marcel Cerdan, and he would carry a photo of his idol at the bottom of his suitcase throughout his career. Boxing career He won more than 100 matches before being noticed by a trainer and being asked to come to France. Halimi began to box as an amateur at age sixteen, and knew that he could expand on his amateur credentials while in the military. At the age of 21, he won the first recognition for his abilities, capturing the French bantamweight amateur title in 1953 and 1954, and won the all-Mediterranean title in 1955. American Billy Peacock fell to Halimi in Paris on March 16, 1956, in a close, strategically fought, ten round points decision. In an important win, Halimi showed dominance in the first and ninth rounds, though the rest appeared even. The Parisian crowd were not pleased with the pace of the bout, as both boxers cautiously circled, jabbed, and repeatedly clinched.\\"US Bantamweight Beaten in Paris\\", Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut, pg. 27, 17 March 1956 =Taking the World Bantamweight Championship, 1957= Mario D'Agata in 1955 On April 1, 1957, at the V√©lodrome d'hiver in Paris, Halimi became world bantamweight champion by defeating the Italian deaf-mute boxer Mario d'Agata in a fifteen-round decision. The partisan Parisian crowd of 17,000 watched Halimi take eleven of the fifteen rounds, while D'Agata managed to win only two.Hudson, Harvey, \\"Halimi Takes Title\\", Elmira Advertiser, Elmira, New York, pg. 9, 2 April 1957 It was D'Agata's first title defense. The bout had no knockdowns, but clinches were common, and the referee frequently had to pull the contestants apart.\\"Halimi Beats Mute For Bantam Crown\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 31, 2 April 1957 Special lights had been set for the fight, to allow d'Agata, who could not hear the bell, to know when each round ended or began. When the bell rang, the lights flashed. There was a storm on the day of the fight, and lightning struck one of the signal lights in round three. d'Agata was struck by sparks, suffering a burned neck and back, but the bout continued. On November 6, 1957, Halimi faced Raul Macias in his second title bout at Los Angeles' Wrigley Field. Halimi shook Macias with a hook to the jaw in the furious fourth round, though the bout featured no knockdowns. Macias lost his NBA World Bantamweight title by a close and controversial 15-round split decision. Macias tried to close stronger in the final round, but was stopped by Halimi's offense.\\"Halimi Bags Split Nod Over Macias\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 71, 7 November 1957 In his next bout on December 8, 1957, he defeated Tanny Campo in a non- title match before 5,000 jeering fans in Marseille, France. The pace of the bout was slow, until the sixth when Halimi landed two hard left hooks to the body of Campo. The pace of the ten round bout displeased the French crowd, but Halimi won the close decision.\\"Halmi Beats Campo As 5000 French Fans Jeer\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 81, 9 December 1957\\"Halimi Defeats Filipino in Ten\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 31, 9 December 1957 Halimi defeated Peter Keenan in a ten-round points decision in Paris on November 17, 1958. In the only knockdown, Halimi floored Keenan with a right to the jaw in the seventh.\\"Halimi Wins Over Keenan in Paris\\", The Tampa Tribune, Tampa, Florida, pg. 19, 18 November 1958 Halimi took a comfortable lead after the second round. Keenan was booed by the crowd of 10,000 for frequently backing away from his opponent. He defended his title against Jose Becerra on July 8, 1959, before a screaming crowd of 15,000 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Midway through the eighth, Becerra trapped Halimi on the ropes and dropped him with a devastating left hook to the jaw. When he arose, he was met with a flurry of punches that dropped him for the full count and took his crown. =Taking the European Bantamweight Championship, 1960= Louis Poncy fell to Halimi in an easy ten round points decision in Paris on April 11, 1960. Poncy, who held a five-pound weight advantage, was the former French Flyweight title holder.Halimi Scores Easy Win Over Poncy in Paris\\", The Times-Record, Troy, New York, pg. 20, 12 April 1960 He knocked out Spanish Bantamweight Champion Juan Cardenas, bringing victory in the third round in Algiers on July 2, 1960.\\"Halimi Stops Spanish\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 10, 3 July 1960 On October 25, 1960, Halimi defeated Irishman Freddie Gilroy, taking the European Bantamweight Championship in a controversial fifteen round points decision. Gilroy, the reigning European and British bantamweight champion, was the favorite of the partisan British crowd. Halimi scored the bout's only real knockdown with a short right hook in the thirteenth round for a count of four. Halimi slipped once to the mat in the seventh without taking a count. He later noted it was one of his best fights.\\"Halimi Gets Disputed Win\\", The Courier News, Bridgewater, New Jersey, pg. 40, 26 October 1960 He lost the title one year later on May 30, 1961, to Johnny Caldwell. Caldwell capped his twenty- second straight win with the victory. Early in the eighth, the crowd of 15,000 watched Caldwell take the lead after leaving a nagging cut over Halimi's eye. In the only knockdown, Caldwell floored Halimi for an eight count in the fifteenth.\\"Caldwell Beats Halimi for Crown\\", The Times Record, Troy, New York, pg. 28, 31 May 1961 On March 5, 1961, he knocked out Belgian Jean Renard in the fourth round in a stunning win in Tunesia.

He regained the European Bantamweight Title on June 26, 1962, defeating Piero Rollo in Tel Aviv. It was the first professional boxing match organized in Israel. Halimi, who wore the Star of David on his trunks, was cheered by the Israeli crowd of 15,000 through all fifteen rounds. After a cut in the first, Rollo had trouble getting inside, taking a defensive posture, except for the last two rounds when he made a desperate, but futile attempt at the decision.\\"Halimi Ready For New Title Bout\\", Tucson Daily Citizen, Tucson, Arizona, pg. 28, 27 June 1962 In a rematch for the title four months later, Halimi lost in a fifteen-round decision. Retirement and death In the 1960s, he settled at Vincennes and owned a caf√© on the Avenue du Ch√¢teau. He later worked as a trainer for the l'Institut National des Sports, and became a swimming teacher in Vichy and Meudon. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease near the end of his life, he resided at a retirement home in Saint-Ouen. He died on November 12, 2006, from pneumonia, and was interred at the Parisian cemetery of Pantin on November 14. Honors *Halimi was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur by Charles de Gaulle. *Halimi, who was Jewish, was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1989. Time wrote of him: \\"Alphonse went to work with a street fighter's will. A grown-up guttersnipe from the back alleys of Algeria.

Mount Adams business district Mount Adams is a geographic landmark and residential neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, located directly east of downtown Cincinnati, south of Walnut Hills, southwest of East Walnut Hills, and west of the East End. Mount Adams is surrounded by one of Cincinnati's finest parks--Eden Park. The park borders the hill on three sides and gives residents a sense of removal from the hustle and bustle of the city. Located within the park is the Krohn Conservatory and one of Cincinnati's oldest water works projects, now part of the park. Mt. Adams landmarks include the Cincinnati Art Museum, Playhouse in the Park, Rookwood Pottery (now converted to a restaurant), Pilgrim Presbyterian Church, Holy Cross Monastery and the Immaculata Church. The 1,491 residents of Mt. Adams have a per capita income of $79,981. History Mount Adams incline, circa 1905 Mount Adams was originally known as Mount Ida. The namesake was from Ida Martin, a washerwoman who lived in the hollow of an old sycamore tree located on a steep hill. In the early 1800s the steep Mount Adams hillside was largely barren as early settlers had cut down all the trees for timber to construct their homes. In 1831, Nicholas Longworth, a wealthy attorney, purchased the mansion that is now the Taft Museum of Art and the large lot of land behind including barren Mount Adams. He transformed the hill into a vineyard. Longworth would become the first commercially successful winemaker in the United States, and has been called the \\"Father of the American Wine Industry.\\"http://www.weekendwinery.com/WineryInsight/Article_Jul03.htm During the 1830s and 1840s Longworth cultivated Catawba grapes, which were used in making his champagne known as Golden Wedding. The wine inspired Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to write the poem \\"Ode to the Catawba Wine.\\"http://library.cincymuseum.org/cinfaq7menu.htm#queencity Contemporaries reported that Longworth's wine \\"transcends the Champagne of France.\\" The winemaking industry around Cincinnati grew rapidly for several decades until it was virtually destroyed by downy mildew, powdery mildew, and black rot around 1860.http://ohioline.osu.edu/b919/pdf/b919.pdf The American Civil War created a shortage of manpower needed for vineyard labor, and the death of Longworth in 1863 furthered the end of Cincinnati's wine industry. Allegedly to increase his property value Longworth donated a portion of the hilltop to the Cincinnati Astronomical Society for an observatory. When the Cincinnati Observatory opened in 1843 it owned the most powerful telescope of its kind.Mount Adams Today, Mount Adams History. Retrieved on 2009-01-11 The hill was renamed Mount Adams in honor of President John Quincy Adams, who delivered the observatory's dedication address. The observatory is still in operation today, though in 1871 it was moved to its current location in Mount Lookout due to excessive smoke from downtown buildings. The old observatory later became the Holy Cross Monastery and Church and expanded, but closed in 1977. The monastery is now the corporate headquarters of Towne Properties ‚Äì a property management company. Although Cincinnati was largely Presbyterian in its early history, Mount Adams was originally a strongly Catholic working- class community composed of the Germans and Irish. The first Protestant church of any denomination to be founded in that neighborhood was Pilgrim Presbyterian Church on Ida Street, near the Ida Street Viaduct.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 649. During the American Civil War two artillery emplacements were installed on the hill to help defend the city from the Confederacy. One was installed at Fort View Place and the other near the present location of the Playhouse in the Park. Neither gun was ever fired. The Mount Adams Incline was completed in 1872 and linked downtown Cincinnati with the hilltop community. The Highland House, the incline hilltop resort, was a popular entertainment venue. Around that time the hill became occupied by a working- class blue-collar population. The Incline was closed in 1948. Then in 1892 Maria Longworth, granddaughter of Nicholas Longworth, opened Rookwood Pottery. Her work is still collected today by many and highly sought after. In the late 1960s people began to gentrify the hilltop neighborhood, including workers who wanted to live near their downtown offices. References External links *Mt.

Term The term is a combination of the word \\"Shabbos\\" (◊©◊ë◊™) meaning the Sabbath day of rest, and goy, which literally means \\"a nation\\" but colloquially means a \\"non-Jew\\" (in Biblical Hebrew \\"goy\\" means simply \\"a nation\\", but in Mishnaic Hebrew it is used in the sense of \\"a non-national\\", i.e., \\"a non-Jew\\"). Description A shabbos goy is a non-Jew who performs certain activities which Jewish religious law (halakha) prohibits a Jew from doing on the Sabbath. There are numerous restrictions and certain types of work are prohibited, such as contractor work. The rabbis ruled that asking a non-Jew to violate Shabbat for oneself is generally forbidden,Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 150a but under certain circumstances the rabbis allowed it, especially to heat the oven on winter days in northern countries. A shabbos goy is not needed where life is at stake (pikuach nefesh) or in the case where there would be a reasonable chance of danger to life (safek pikuach nefesh). Originally, the job of the shabbos goy was often given to a poor woman, and the compensation was in the form of challah; later, money was given, although not on Shabbat or not directly given to the worker, due to halakhic restrictions on hiring workers on Shabbat. According to Ronald J. Eisenberg, \\"Today the proliferation of electronic timers has virtually eliminated the need for the Shabbos goy, who once played an important role, especially in the shtetls of Eastern Europe.\\"  Notable examples  Notable examples include Maxim Gorky, Floyd B. Olson, Harry S. Truman, Peter Hammill,Chan, Sewell, \\"White Ethnic Politics: Irish and Italian Catholics and Jews, Oh, My!\\", The New York Times, October 25, 2007. \\"'I became the Shabbos goy at the synagogue,' he said.

Unlike other types, SCA 6 is not fatal. This cerebellar function is permanent and progressive, differentiating it from episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) where said dysfunction is episodic. In some SCA6 families, some members show these classic signs of SCA6 while others show signs more similar to EA2, suggesting that there is some phenotypic overlap between the two disorders. SCA6 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, a gene encoding a calcium channel Œ± subunit. These mutations tend to be trinucleotide repeats of CAG, leading to the production of mutant proteins containing stretches of 20 or more consecutive glutamine residues; these proteins have an increased tendency to form intracellular agglomerations. Unlike many other polyglutamine expansion disorders expansion length is not a determining factor for the age that symptoms present. Signs and symptoms SCA6 is typified by progressive and permanent cerebellar dysfunction. These cerebellar signs include ataxia and dysarthria, likely caused by cerebellar atrophy. Prior to diagnosis and the onset of major symptoms, patients often report a feeling of \\"wooziness\\" and momentary imbalance when turning corners or making rapid movements. The age at which symptoms first occur varies widely, from age 19 to 71, but is typically between 43 and 52. Other major signs of SCA6 are the loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation and nystagmus. While most patients present with these severe progressive symptoms, others, sometimes within the same family, display episodic non-progressive symptoms more similar to episodic ataxia. Still others present with symptoms common to both SCA6 and familial hemiplegic migraine. Pathophysiology Most cases of SCA6 are a result of CAG repeat expansion beyond the normal range, i.e., more than 19 repeats, in the Cav2.1 calcium channel encoding gene CACNA1A. This gene has two splice forms, \\"Q-type\\" and \\"P-type\\", and the polyglutamine coding CAG expansion occurs in the P-type splice form. This form is expressed heavily in the cerebellum where it is localized in Purkinje cells. In Purkinje cells from SCA6 patients, mutant Cav2.1 proteins form ovular intracellular inclusions, or aggregations, similar in many ways to those seen in other polyglutamine expansion disorders such as Huntington's disease. In cell culture models of the disease, this leads to early apoptotic cell death. Mutant channels that are able to traffic properly to the membrane have a negatively shifted voltage-dependence of inactivation. The result of this is that the channels are active for a shorter amount of time and, consequently, cell excitability is decreased. There are also a number of point mutations resulting in patients with phenotypes reminiscent of episodic ataxia and SCA6 (C271Y, G293R and R1664Q) or familial hemiplegic migraine and SCA6 (R583Q and I1710T). C287Y and G293R are both located in the pore region of domain 1 and are present in a single family each. Expression of these mutant channels results in cells with drastically decreased current density compared to wild-type expressing cells. In cell-based assays, it was found that these mutant channels aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum, not dissimilar from that seen in the CAG expansion mutants above. R1664Q is in the 4th transmembrane spanning segment of domain 4 and, presumably, affects the channel's voltage dependence of activation. Little is known about the point mutations resulting in overlapping phenotypes of familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic ataxia. R583Q is present in the 4th transmembrane spanning region of domain 2 while the I1710T mutation is segment 5 of domain 4. Diagnosis Spinocerebellar Ataxia Diagnosis is done via genetic testing. Your Neurologist can administer the test. Spinocerebellar Ataxia is often misdiagnosed as other diseases such as ALC or Parkinson's Disease. Screening There is no known prevention of spinocerebellar ataxia. Those who are believed to be at risk can have genetic sequencing of known SCA loci performed to confirm inheritance of the disorder. Treatment There are no drug based treatments currently available for SCA Type 6, however, there are supportive treatments that may be useful in managing symptoms. Physical Therapy, Speech Pathology can help patients manage the symptoms. Epidemiology The prevalence of SCA6 varies by culture. In Germany, SCA6 accounts for 10-25% of all autosomal dominant cases of SCA (SCA itself having a prevalence of 1 in 100,000). This prevalence in lower in Japan, however, where SCA6 accounts for only ~6% of spinocerebellar ataxias. In Australia, SCA6 accounts for 30% of spinocerebellar ataxia cases while 11% in the Dutch.

History  The oldest club in the city of Halle was founded as Hallescher Fu√üballclub von 1896 on 16 July 1896. HFC was one of a dozen clubs that formed the VMBV (Verbandes Mitteldeutscher Ballspielvereine or Federation of Middle German Football Teams) on 16 December 1900 and was a founding member of the DFB (Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund) in Leipzig in January 1900. In 1909 the club was the first in the country to purchase its own grounds and on 10 September 1910 hosted VfB Leipzig in their new stadium facility. The club merged with the Kaufm√§nnischer Turnverein Halle on 23 September 1919 to become VfL Halle von 1896. The short-lived union ended in April the following year, but the club kept its new name. Throughout this period Halle enjoyed numerous successes, winning seven VMBV regional championships, as well as overall league titles in 1917 and 1919. German football was reorganized under the Third Reich in 1933 into sixteen top-flight Gauligen. VfL Halle joined the Gauliga Mitte in 1937 and played first division football there until 1944, earning middling results. Play in the division ended with the advance of Allied armies into Germany as World War II drew to a close. In the aftermath of the war, the Allied occupying authorities banned all organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs. In November 1946, the club was re-established as SG Giebichenstein, becoming SG Genossenschaften Halle in May 1949, and BSG Empor Halle in 1951. The club played anonymously in the lower divisions of East German football over four- and-a-half decades, making only a single-season cameo appearance in the second division DDR-Liga in 1981‚Äì82. After German reunification in 1990 the team played in the seventh tier Berziksliga as SV Empor Halle where they won the division championship and earned promotion to the Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt (VI). They re-claimed the name VfL Halle the following year and continued to play well, advancing through the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt (V) and NOFV- Oberliga S√ºd (IV) on their way to a breakthrough into the Regionalliga Nordost (III) in 1999. While the footballers put forward a decent effort it was not enough to stay up in the Regionalliga as the league went through restructuring. The following season the club was forced out of the Oberliga (IV) in spite of a sixth-place finish because of financial difficulties. VfL made a return to the Oberliga in 2009 where it plays today.Das deutsche Fu√üball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesVfL Halle 1896 at Fussball.de Tables and results of all German football leagues  Honours  The club's honours: * Central German football championship ** Winners: 1917, 1919 * NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd (IV) ** Champions: 1999 * Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt (V/VI) ** Champions: 1995, 2009 * Saxony-Anhalt Cup (Tiers III-VI) ** Winners: 1997, 1999 ** Runners-up: 1996, 2000, 2015  References   External links  * * Abseits Guide to German Soccer Category:Football clubs in Germany Category:Football clubs in East Germany Category:Football clubs in Saxony- Anhalt Category:Association football clubs established in 1896 Category:1896 establishments in Germany Category:Sport in Halle (Saale) Category:Works association football clubs in Germany ","title":"VfL Halle 1896"},{"id":"7957331","text":"The Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS) awards the Massey Medal annually to recognize outstanding personal achievement in the exploration, development or description of the geography of Canada.

He has won two Grammy Awards for Best Album Notes.[ All Music] He is the former Executive Director and currently Senior Scholar of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. In the late 1970s he played professionally with alumni of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands. In 1980 he formed his own big band, which in 1985 became the last Benny Goodman orchestra.Down Beat Artist's Profile Career =Early years and education= Schoenberg was born on July 23, 1958, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where he attended Fair Lawn High School.Parisi, Albert J. \\"Fond Memories of the 'King of Swing'\\", The New York Times, October 1, 1989. Accessed July 23, 2016. \\"'Everybody I knew as a kid was into rock bands and heavy-metal stuff, but it just didn't do anything for me,' said Mr. Schoenberg, a 31-year-old Fair Lawn native...Over the years, besides studying music at Fair Lawn High School, Mr. Schoenberg managed to enter what he described as the Goodman 'inner circle,' made up of musicians who had worked with the artist in his heyday.\\" His father worked for the New York Telephone Company. His mother, a children's librarian, began teaching him the piano when he was four and then found a neighborhood teacher for him. In the early 1970s, he became a jazz fan through the music of Benny Goodman. He saw musicians perform at nearby venues, talking to them afterwards, and was sometimes invited to perform. He received informal piano lessons from Teddy Wilson, and Hank Jones. In 1972, Wilson took him to a jazz performance at the Waldorf Astoria, where he met Benny Goodman. During the same year, he began volunteering at the Jazz Museum in New York City, meeting more jazz musicians. At the urging of Ruby Braff, he took piano lessons from Sanford Gold. At the museum, he met Benny Goodman again while working on an exhibit about Goodman. At fifteen, he began teaching himself the saxophone, inspired by Lester Young. In 1976, Schoenberg entered the Manhattan School of Music. In school he changed his concentration from piano to saxophone. He got a job playing saxophone in Eddie Durham's quartet. Playing with Durham, one of the original members of the Count Basie band, gave him opportunities to work with Eddie Barefield, Al Casey, Roy Eldridge, Panama Francis, Jo Jones, Sammy Price, and Jabbo Smith. In 1979, he produced a Charlie Parker and Lester Young tribute at Carnegie Recital Hall, arranging the songs, gathering the musicians, and performing with them. The concert included Joe Albany, Eddie Bert, Herb Ellis, Mel Lewis, Howard McGhee, and Dicky Wells. =With Benny Goodman= In 1980, Schoenberg received an unexpected call from Benny Goodman. The clarinetist intended to donate his collection of historical jazz arrangements to the New York Public Library. Schoenberg was known for his interest in history and in Goodman's music. He left the Manhattan School of Music to work on the collection, which were to be divvied out to the library in annual installments. A few years after he began, Goodman stopped donating his arrangements to the New York Public Library. He hired Schoenberg as his assistant, and later as his manager. Goodman died in 1986. His will stipulated that his remaining arrangements and recordings be donated to Yale University and his favorite back brace to Schoenberg. Schoenberg was chosen to appraise the Goodman Archives. Yale hired him to help curate the collection and to compile a nine-CD box set of unreleased recordings. =Loren Schoenberg Big Band= Schoenberg formed the Loren Schoenberg Big Band, a repertory group devoted to performing the more obscure classics of the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, though it eventually performed new works as well. The band performed at major venues, including the Blue Note, Michael's Pub, and Carnegie Hall. In 1984, the Loren Schoenberg Big Band released its first album, That's the Way It Goes, followed by Time Waits for No One (1987), Solid Ground (1988), Just A-Settin' and A-Rockin ' (1989), Manhattan Work Song (1992), and Out of This World (1999). Schoenberg recorded S'posin ' in 1990 with a quartet and has recorded with Benny Carter, Jimmy Heath, Bobby Short, Christian McBride, and John Lewis. In 1985, Schoenberg's band formed an association with the New York Swing Dance Society and began providing accompaniment for the organization's events. Benny Goodman asked the band to perform with him on the PBS television special Let's Dance Already, which became Goodman's last televised performance. =Conducting and directing= In 1986, Schoenberg joined the American Jazz Orchestra, where he remained until 1992, playing tenor sax and later following John Lewis as its musical director. He has conducted the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra. In 1988 and 1989, he conducted the West German Radio Orchestra for a series of concerts, performing the works of George Gershwin and Duke Ellington for audiences in Cologne. Also during that period, he led, with Mel Lewis, a band for third stream jazz musician Gunther Schuller in Japan. In 1993, he was musical director for the International Duke Ellington Conference. Pianist Bobby Short hired Schoenberg as his musical director and saxophonist in 1997, a position he retained until Short's passing in 2005. =National Jazz Museum= Schoenberg is Senior Scholar of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. In June 2003, he and his National Jazz Museum in Harlem All-Stars band performed at the White House to raise awareness about the museum. The band played with Herb Jeffries, a 92-year-old baritone singer and an original member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra. =Writing= Schoenberg's writing on jazz has appeared in The New York Times, The Lester Young Reader, The Oxford Companion to Jazz, and Masters of the Jazz Saxophone. In the summer of 2002, his first book, The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to Jazz, was published with an introduction by Wynton Marsalis. Schoenberg wrote, \\"What makes jazz music different from country, classical, rock, and other well-known genres is its basic malleability...The great majority of it is not, as many believe, spun out of the air as if from some ephemeral, phantom spider, but is rather a highly organized and (unfortunately) spontaneous set of theme and variations.\\" He has won two Grammy Awards for his liner notes. In 1994, with Dan Morgenstern, he won a Grammy Award for Best Album Notes Louis Armstrong: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man 1923‚Äì1934, a boxed set of rare and essential recordings. In 2005, he won a Grammy for Best Liner Notes for The Complete Columbia Recordings of Woody Herman and His Orchestra & Woodchoppers (1945‚Äì1947) for Mosaic Records. =Radio and television= From 1982‚Äì1990, Schoenberg hosted a weekly radio show on WKCR, where he played old jazz recordings, interviewed musicians, produced documentary specials, and broadcast live performances. In 1984, he became a co-host of Jazz from the Archives, a radio show on WBGO run by the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University. In September 1998, he participated in a television program filmed at the White House with President Clinton, featuring musicians Wynton Marsalis, Marian McPartland, Billy Taylor, and David Baker. He served as an adviser to the PBS documentary Jazz by Ken Burns. Also that year, he became host of a radio program on Sirius satellite radio. =Teaching= In addition to his duties as Senior Scholar of the Jazz Museum, Schoenberg is on the faculty of Juilliard's Institute for Jazz Studies. He has also taught at the New School, the Manhattan School of Music, William Paterson University, SUNY/Purchase, The Hartt School, Barnard College, the Essentially Ellington Band Director's Academy in Snowmass, Colorado, The Juilliard Evening School, and Long Island University. He frequently lectures at Stanford University, and has given lectures at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Philharmonic. Schoenberg was the Academic Director of the Jazz Aspen Snowmass Jazz Colony summer program.

His detainee ID number is 028. Guantanamo analysts estimated he was born in 1977, in Bajor, Yemen. Al-Alawi arrived at Guantanamo on January 17, 2002, and has been held at Guantanamo for . In January 2010, the Guantanamo Review Task Force recommended he should be classed as a \\"forever prisoner\\", one who has not committed a crime but is too dangerous to release. In his 2015 Periodic Review Board hearing, intelligence analysts no longer alleged that he was one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards, now claiming that he \\"had spent time\\" with some of those bodyguards. Al-Alawi's petitions for release have been rejected by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States. Al-Alawi is a long-term Guantanamo hunger striker, who has described his force-feeding as \\"an endless horror story.\\" In March 2015, he weighed just 98 pounds. Detention In the week after the September 11 attacks, Congress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001, which empowered the President to wage war against those \\"he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks.\\". In November 2001, President George W. Bush issued the Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism military order, which authorized the detention of al-Qaeda members and supporters of the Taliban. Al-Alwi was captured in Pakistan during Operation Enduring Freedom and transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in January 2002. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 In Rasul v. Bush (2004), the Supreme Court of the United States found that Guantanamo detainees were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. Following the Supreme Court's ruling, the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... are associated with both Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges that the following detainees stayed in Al Qaeda, Taliban or other guest- or safehouses.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... were at Tora Bora.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives whose \\"names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges that the following detainees were captured under circumstances that strongly suggest belligerency.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... served on Osama Bin Laden's security detail.\\" * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the captives who was an \\"al Qaeda operative\\". * Muaz Hamza Ahmad Alawi was listed as one of the \\"82 detainees made no statement to CSRT or ARB tribunals or made statements that do not bear materially on the military's allegations against them.\\" =Habeas corpus petitions= Al-Alwi first petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus in 2005, arguing he was not an enemy combatant. The court did not consider the petition until after the Supreme Court of the United States in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) determined that Guantanamo prisoners had a constitutional right to bring such petitions. On December 30, 2008, District Court Judge Richard J. Leon denied Al Alawi's petition. In a separate ruling, the court also found that Hisham Sliti, \\"were part of or supported the Taliban\\", and thus could continue to be held in US custody. The New York Times called the two rulings: \\"the first clear-cut victories for the Bush administration\\", while Andy Worthington noted they represented a \\"disturbing development\\".Worthington, Andy. Judge orders release of Guantanamo's forgotten child , December 2008 Glaberson reported that Leon stated he did not have to take a position on the Bush administration's claim Al Alawi was an Osama bin Laden bodyguard, that there was enough evidence he had supported the Taliban to confirm his designation as an \\"enemy combatant\\". In July 2011, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Merrick Garland which concluded Al Alwi was in fact an enemy combatant lawfully detained under the 2001 AMUF. In December 2014, President Barack Obama announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Al-Alwi then filed a new petition for habeas corpus, arguing that the government's authority to detain him ‚Äúunraveled‚Äù when President Obama declared an end to hostilities. In February 2017, District Judge Leon again denied Al Alwi's petition, finding that hostilities were nevertheless ongoing. In August 2018, a unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit again affirmed, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson. She reasoned that the 2001 AUMF had not expired, that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 had further authorized detentions, and that the international law of war permitted detention of enemy combatants as long as \\"active combat\\" continued. al-Alwi then petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. In June 2019, the Court denied that petition, with Justice Stephen Breyer including a statement arguing that the Court should at some point consider the constitutionality of continued detentions in a later \\"appropriate case\\". =Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment= On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts. A thirteen-page Joint Task Force Guantanamo detainee assessment was drafted for him on March 14, 2008. It was signed by camp commandant Rear Admiral Mark H. Buzby, who recommended continued detention. =Joint Review Task Force= When he assumed office in January 2009 President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Al Alawi was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board. Al Alawi was denied approval for transfer on October 26, 2015.http://www.prs.mil/Portals/60/Documents/ISN028/151026_U_ISN28_FINAL_DETERMINATION_PUBLIC.pdf Analysts still continued to assert that he was one of the \\"dirty thirty\\", a group of thirty individuals, captured together while fleeing to Pakistan, who analysts maintained were all Osama bin Laden bodyguards. =Periodic Review= Al Alawi's Guantanamo Review Task Force had concurred with earlier review boards, and recommended he be classed as too dangerous to release, although there was no evidence to justify charging him with a crime. Carol Rosenberg, of the Miami Herald, wrote that the recommendation from his Periodic Review Board concluded that he was \\"probably not\\" one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards, but that he seemed to have \\"spent time with\\" them. Medical condition As of 2015, al Alawi is recognized as one of the camp's long-term hunger strikers. Camp authorities published the weight records from the first four years. Those records show al Alawi's weight being recorded 53 times. His weight was only recorded twice during the camp's first well-known hunger strikes, in 2005, where his weight dropped to 117 and 118 pounds. But a hunger-strike he began in 2013, has left him weighing less than 100 pounds. Al Alawi described his hunger strike as a form of peaceful protest. In 2013, a new warden was appointed to the camp, Colonel John Bogdan. Under his administration guards fired upon the captives, for the first time. Al Alawi was one of the captives guards shot. He described being shot with rubber coated steel bullets in April 2013. Robert Durand, a camp spokesman, asserted guards were provoked, and that they only fired \\"four less than lethal rounds\\". Al Alawi described being fired upon without warning when he and other men were preparing for communal prayers. According to al Alawi's account, he was hit by more than four munitions. According to al Alawi, his wounds were either inadequately treated, or not treated at all.

Mawlay Mohammed Al-Sheikh Al-Sharif Al- Hassani Al-Drawi Al-Tagmaderti () known as Mohammed Al-Sheikh (1490/1491 ‚Äì 23 October 1557) was the first sultan of the Saadi dynasty of Morocco (1544‚Äì57). \\"Al-Drawi at-Tagmadert\\" means: the man from the Draa river valley, from Tagmadert.

War against the Portuguese After the death of his father Abu Abdallah al-Qaim in 1517, Mohammed ash-Sheikh (together with his brother Ahmad al-Araj) took command of the war of the Saadi against the Portuguese. They conquered Marrakesh in 1524. Ahmad al-Araj became Emir of Marrakesh, while still recognizing the Wattasid Sultan of Fez, while Mohammed ash-Sheikh remained as ruler of Taroudannt.The last great Muslim empires: history of the Muslim world Frank Ronald Charles Bagley, Hans Joachim Kissling p.102ff In 1527, the Treaty of Tadla was passed between the Saadians and the Wattasids, following the Wattasid defeat in the battle of Wadi al-Abid. Both dynasties agreed to their dominion on respective territories, separated by Tadla. After 1536, and the rise in power of Araj, the brothers came into conflict with each other. Ahmad al-Araj had in effect allied himself with the Wattasids under regent Ali Abu Hassun (1524‚Äì54). Mohammed ash-Sheikh could maintain his position in Southern Morocco and conquered Agadir in 1541 and other coastal towns, ousting the Portuguese. After the loss of Agadir, the Portuguese immediately evacuated Azamor (1513‚Äì41) and Safi (1488‚Äì1541). Eventually, brother Ahmad al-Araj fled to Tafilalet. War against the Wattasids and Ottomans After reorganising his army after Ottoman example he succeeded in conquering Fez in 1549, causing the downfall of the Wattasids.

The game was a finalist for an award at the 2007 Independent Games Festival. It was later ported to the Wii, under the name Doctor Fizzwizzle's Animal Rescue. Plot and gameplay The \\"fizzball\\" grows as more objects and animals are drawn into it. Here, the ball contains a cow. All of the island's animals have been acting strange lately. Professor Fizzwizzle takes on the task of capturing them all in his newly invented magic bubble. The animals are then kept in a nursery and fed using the coins he has collected throughout the island's levels. Players obtain coins by completing a series of levels in which the bubble is bounced upward, toward a playfield filled with animals. Different stages feature breakable objects such as fences which must be destroyed to reach some animals. The animals come in a variety of sizes, some of which cannot be collected with the bubble at its initial size; the bubble starts out small, allowing only the smallest animals to be collected, but as more are captured, the bubble increases in size, making larger animals available. Along with the animals, stages are populated with hazards such as barrels of toxic waste. For avoiding these hazards, players are awarded bonus points. In the PC version, the paddle (a rocket) is controlled using a mouse. The Wii port instead supports the Wii Remote's pointer and tilt functions, the Nunchuk, the Classic Controller and the Wii Balance Board. Reception The game had a generally positive reception.

Datta means \\"given\\" or \\"granted\\" in Sanskrit and is also an alternative name for the Hindu deity Dattatreya.  Bengal  According to Indian historian Tej Ram Sharma, in Bengal the surname Dutta/Datta (‡¶¶‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§) is used by Kayastha caste. The office of Kayastha (scribe) was instituted before the Gupta period (c.320 to 550 CE). Originally, Kayastha was composed of people from different Varnas, including Brahmins and Kshatriyas. After the Gupta reign, the Kayasthas in Bengal developed into a caste, and gained a higher status, incorporating the Pala, Sena and Varman Kings and their descendants. In the middle period of the history of Bengal, between 1500 and 1850 CE, the Kayasthas were regarded as one of the highest of Hindu castes in the region. Some members of the Baidya caste use Dutta/Datta as a surname, although they more often use compounded variations such as Duttagupta or Duttasharma instead.  Punjab  Punjabi Duttas belong to the Mohyal community.

This is considered to be an annoyance or hazard to some users because the program may steal the focus while their attention is not on the computer screen, such as when typing while reading copy to the side. This will cause everything typed after the window appeared to be lost ‚Äì or worse, the typed input may cause an unintended effect in the newly focused window. On slow computers, users are sometimes not even alerted to this behavior in time, because the associated window is only actually displayed several seconds after the actual focus change happened.  Security issues  Focus stealing can cause damage, as users may, while typing when their attention is away from the screen, inadvertently agree to a program doing something that causes damage.

Established in 1845 in the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia, the parish was closed on July 1, 2013, part of a wide-ranging re-organization of Catholic parishes in the Philadelphia Archdiocese; it became part of Holy Innocents Parish along with two other, nearby closed parishes, Mater Dolorosa and St. Joan of Arc.http://catholicphilly.com/2013/06/local-news/local-catholic-news/parishes- in-four-regions-of-philadelphia-archdiocese-to-merge-july-1/ History =Founding through construction of second church= The history of St. Joachim‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church in Frankford began in the year 1843. About twenty men met in a small house in the area of the northern portion of the Frankford borough of Philadelphia. This meeting was held to discuss the purchase of a tract of land in which to construct a Catholic Chapel for the area of Frankford. Up until and during that period many Catholics in the area would worship at either St. Michael‚Äôs on Second Street or St. Stephen‚Äôs, both in Philadelphia. Those present at that meeting included William Keenan (the homeowner), John McCafferty, John Haney, Timothy Britt, Patrick Farren. The result of the meeting was the purchase of a tract of land around the area of Harrison Street and Frankford Avenue for $600 from the Thompson estate. Shortly after this the acquired land was exchanged for the present site of St. Joachim‚Äôs church on June 18, 1844. The reason given was that many residents felt that this location on Harrison Street was ‚Äúout in the fields‚Äù. The present site, which a Dr. Lamb donated, stands at what is now Griscom, Church, and Penn Streets. The property at Harrison Street was sold for $650 to a Mr. Charles Ball. The cornerstone would not be laid until September 28, 1845. So until that time Sunday school was held in a house on Paul Street. Early in 1844, Rev. Dominick Forestal, who would become St. Joachim‚Äôs first pastor, was an assistant at St. Mary‚Äôs Church located on South 4th Street in Philadelphia. He was appointed to visit Frankford and to evaluate the situation. He found that the congregation was quite small, but large enough to warrant the building of a church. After informing the bishop with the state of affairs in Frankford, the bishop at the time was The Most Reverend Francis Patrick Kenrick, Father Forestal received the necessary authority to begin the task of building the church in Frankford. An even greater task now faced Father Forestal, and that was collecting the funds to do so. To his surprise many of the residents of Frankford stepped up and gave what they could. The building contract was awarded to Lewis Lakey, carpenter and Thomas E. Deal, mason. The estimated cost was $9,000. Even though the purchase of the land occurred in 1843, and the permission was given to Father Forestal to build in 1844, the cornerstone was not laid until September 28, 1845 because of the nativist riots in the city in 1844. It was these riots, focused primarily at but not limited to Catholics of Irish origin that saw the burning of Catholic churches in the area. These riots did not touch the Frankford area, and the building of the new Catholic Church was underway. The blessing and laying of the cornerstone was officiated by the Rt. Rev. C√©lestine de la Hailandi√®re, Bishop of Vincennes, Indiana, with Bishop Kenrick in attendance. The work went slowly and Father Forestal died in 1847 before the work was completed. Visitations by other priests occurred for a few months until a new pastor was appointed. Reverend James O‚ÄôKane became the first ‚Äúresident pastor‚Äù and was well acquainted with the parish. He was an employee of nearby Friend's Asylum before entering the seminary. In Father O‚ÄôKane‚Äôs first year, the church was completed and the first mass was held. Until then the people of St. Joachim‚Äôs worshiped at another church, St. Ann‚Äôs, until the building was complete. In 1849 cholera desolated the area. Father O‚ÄôKane, along with the Rev. Henry S. Spackman, rector of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, threw aside their own safety and tended to those who fell victim to the disease and administered to the dying. Father O'Kane died in April 1852. The first high mass of the church was sung at his funeral, and he was laid to rest in the cemetery behind the church. He was succeeded by the Rev. F. X. Villanis, who remained until the autumn of 1856. Under Father Villanis the pastoral house was built. It was a rough-cast house with a gable end and a slanted roof facing Church Street. The only back building was an open shed. The residence cost $3,800. The Rev. John McGovern then became pastor. It was under Father McGovern that the Old Baptist Church, now owned by the United Presbyterian Church standing on Penn Street, was purchased. He converted it to a parochial school tended by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart. The Baptist Church was built in 1807 on what was then the corner of Edwards and Pine Streets. The purchase took place March 12, 1863 at a cost of $2,400. The present school was erected in 1885. Also under Father McGovern‚Äôs charge the Convent in which the Sisters resided was built at a cost of $13,000. A steeple was erected on the church building at a cost of $8,000. The architect of the tower and spire was John T. Mahony.See Philadelphia Press, 04 Dec 1858, \\"A Church Spire Raised\\" The builder of the steeple was Edward Allen, who later became an undertaker. The mason was John Peters. The tower would stand 250 feet and during its construction one of the slate roofers fell from the structure to his death. Smaller congregations grew up in the outlining areas of the parish and were tended to by the priests of St. Joachim‚Äôs. These areas extended as far as Bustleton which was started by Father McGovern, and even farther to Jenkintown and included Fox Chase, Holmesburg, and Tacony. These smaller congregations would eventually break away from St. Joachim‚Äôs into their own parishes. In 1872, Father Nicholas J. Walsh was appointed pastor. Under Father Walsh the congregation began to meet to discuss the building of a new church as the present church building had been condemned as unsafe and unfit for worship. The congregation had outgrown the building. The last Mass was said in the original building on September 15, 1873. A temporary chapel was built on the site of the present school building and the original church building was torn down. ‚ÄúA plan was provided for a stone structure of ample dimensions, of Gothic style, and having a basement and main stor(e)y.‚Äù The cost of the new church building was $90,000 and was planned by Edwin Forrest Durang and assisted by a fellow Frankford resident Frank Watson. The funds raised for the new church building even included donations by non-Catholics. In June 1874, the cornerstone was laid. The work again went slowly and was not complete by the time Father Walsh‚Äôs duties as pastor were completed. In 1877, he was transferred to St. Charles Borromeo and was succeeded by Father John P. Byrne, who was an assistant in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Under Father Byrne the new church was ready for dedication in October 1880. Archbishop Wood officiated at the dedication. With no further use of the temporary chapel, it was torn down and the present school building as we know today was built. At the time it was known as the finest school building in the city. Father Byrne also had the wall along the church yard on Griscom Street built by Edward Flynn for a cost of $3,000. Unlike a few of his predecessors, Father Byrne was able to see his work completed. He died on August 22, 1891 and was followed by Father Francis P. Fitzmaurice. =The 20th century until the Oblates= At this time the congregation numbered 4,000 souls. The boundaries of the parish had shrunk from the former far-reaching borders. That year the parish was stated to be south to Venango, North to Dark Run Lane (now Cheltenham Ave.) and west to Frankford Creek. On July 29, 1902 Father Fitzmaurice arranged with Mayer and Co. of New York for stained glass windows to be installed. The windows were as follows: Two windows in the sanctuary at the cost of $450 each and 24 windows in the nave of the church, each to have the single picture of a saint with rich gothic canopy at $220 each. The total cost of the work was $6,180. Under Father Fitzmaurice many improvements and additions were made to the church. The bell tower was constructed by a local contractor, James T. Murphy. The tower was completed in 1912. It was this bell that became a major part of everyone‚Äôs lives in Frankford. It is told that at 7am when the bell rang, everyone knew it was time to get up and go to work; at noon when the bell rang, lunch, and at 6pm when the bell rang again the family would gather and share dinner together. In 1914, a marble altar, wainscoting, flooring and rail were added. The stone was supplied by the Vermont Marble Company. In 1915, electricity was added to the church. Father Fitzmaurice also remodeled the rectory. No records exist of who had the pipe organ installed, but it was there before electricity. The organ was rebuilt in 1973, at a cost of $5,000. It was believed to have been the work of Theodore Knauff, a famous 19th century organ builder. Father Fitzmaurice didn't stop with renovations. A new convent was built at Church and Penn Streets. This meant more debt but Father Fitzmaurice did so at the cost of $79,570 and it was completed in 1922. In 1925 at the age of 77, Father Fitzmaurice died. He is buried behind the church. Father Fitzmaurice was also responsible for the purchase of the remaining land around the school from the Baptist church in 1895. This land became the school playground after it was graded. The current flagpole in the school yard was installed in 1898. Presented by the literary organization of the parish at a cost of $450 it stood 150 tall. For the next quarter century through the Great Depression and the Second World War the church was pastored by a man best known as an educator and the builder of schools. Rev. John B. Dever served until his death in 1950. Just as the man before him, Father Dever would make repairs and renovations. Under him the church celebrated the parish‚Äôs 100th anniversary. For this he made extensive repairs throughout the month of February 1943. Following Father Dever in 1950 was a Kensington native, Father Thomas A. McNally. Under Father McNally the rectory again saw renovations and he was the first pastor to hold Catholic Youth Organization dances for the teens of the parish. Father James A. Donnelly would follow. A West Philadelphia native, Father Donnelly was once an assistant at St. Joachim and left to establish St. Joseph‚Äôs parish in Green Ridge. Under Father Donnelly the rectory was refurnished and brought up-to-date. In 1954 the Rev. Francis A. Fagan came to serve as pastor. Under Father Fagan the debt for the rectory was paid off. Father Fagan would remain as pastor Emeritus of St. Joachim‚Äôs until his death on October 13, 1972. It was during his term that Second Vatican Council occurred and many changes came to ways Catholics would worship. In June 1971, St. Joachim‚Äôs welcomed their new pastor, Father William L. Cotterall. Where changes to the liturgy were seen under Father Fagan the changes to the church as a result of Second Vatican came under Father Cotterall. With the liturgical changes it was evident that the church was no longer adequate. Revamping of the sanctuary included placing the altar, the pulpit and the baptismal font closer to the people, painting of the vestibule, removal of the old confessionals and installation of two combination confessionals. Also conference rooms with air conditioning were built with speakers so that parents of little children could participate in Mass. The altar railings were removed and the floors were carpeted to keep the church warmer in the winter. Father Cotterall also made $60,000 worth of renovations to the school building. Father Cotterall remained pastor until June 29, 1978 when he was reassigned to Nativity B.V.M. =The Oblates of St. Francis de Sales and the 1979 fire= It was also this date, June 29, 1978 that a great change came to the St. Joachim parish. Facing a dwindling supply of priests the Archdiocese could not supply priests to the church. On this day The Oblates of Saint Francis de Sales (OSFS) came to administer the church. With them came a man that stood 6‚Äô4‚Äù (195 cm) and was of Italian-American descent born in Wilmington Delaware. Father Anthony F. Silvestri came to St. Joachim‚Äôs and introduced a new era with his assistant Father John Bradunas. The toughest task to that time for Father Silvestri was to help the people of the parish along with the transition from diocesan priests. Father opened his door to everyone stating that his home was everyone‚Äôs home. The parish was renewed and strengthened like never before. But it would be just a couple of weeks short of a year on June 8, 1979 that Father Silvestri and Father Bradunas would face what no other pastor or priest of the parish had to face. On a sunny day which just happened to be Father Silvestri‚Äôs birthday business was as usual until the smell of smoke was noticed. Father Silvestri was returning from a lunch when he and a Mr. Glenn Martin saw the smoke. Father Silvestri jumped out of the car and started to run thinking that the parish house was on fire. Passing someone on the street he asked what the smoke was coming from. ‚ÄúThe church!!!‚Äù they said. Father asked what church. ‚ÄúYour church father!!‚Äù A few hard months later, on December 19, 1979 it was decided that the church would not be rebuilt and would be demolished as well as the parish house. From the laying of the cornerstone in June 1874 until that June day in 1979 the church of St. Joachim‚Äôs stood as one of Frankford‚Äôs greatest landmarks. But as this parish and neighborhood has shown over and over again a stumbling block may break their hearts but it does not stop their drive. With services being held in the school, plans for a new church were being made. An altar, sections which would be placed in the new chapel, mosaics, fixtures, marble statues and some of the stained glass windows were saved for the new church. On May 11, 1980 groundbreaking took place. The new St. Joachim‚Äôs church building was underway. The architect hired to do the work was Ronald Knabb of Knabb Associates. There are three arches that serve as the entrance into the church courtyard which itself serves as the entrance into the chapel and the church. The center is the chapel and to the right of the building is the parish house which serves as home to the clergy. The outside walls of the church are brick construction, the floors are terrazzo. A hot air heating system, an air conditioning system, restrooms and three meeting rooms named after three former pastors were built. The three pastors for whom the meeting rooms were named are Father Fitzmaurice, Father Fagan, and Father O‚ÄôKane. The pews are made of oak and seat approximately 600 to 650 people. There is a hand carved statue of St. Joachim in the foyer, also a hand carved crucifix at the altar. The tiles in the Sanctuary are Florida earthstone and the tiles for the vestibule, narthex and church are Florida tile. There are hand carved statues of St. Joseph and the Blessed Mother as well as hand carved Stations of the Cross. The hand carving was done by Bob McGovern, a paraplegic. Total cost of the new church building and furnishings totaled 1.9 million dollars. On December 13, 1981, a mass of dedication was held and the church as we know it today became a new landmark in Frankford. Father Silvestri would continue to pastor the church introducing many new traditions such as the St. Patrick's Pageant, Santa Lucia Pageant, Blessing of the children‚Äôs Easter baskets, Rose Sunday, Blessing of the Animals, and monthly Spaghetti Dinners. Father Silvestri would finish through the 1980s as pastor and would return to his home of Wilmington, Delaware with a new assignment. =Closure= The St. Joachim members unsuccessfully petitioned to stay open when the archdiocese announced the congregation's closure. Education St. Joachim had a parish school, and later Holy Innocents Area Catholic School was its designated Catholic school.

The episode was written by staff writers Ashley Gable and Thomas A. Swyden, and directed by Stephen Posey. The episode originally aired on April 28, 1997. In this episode, Willow accidentally releases the demon Moloch onto the Internet, where he becomes a sentient malware and gains a cult following. Plot In Cortona, Italy, in 1418, a circle of priests trap a horned demon (Moloch \\"the Corruptor\\") in a book using a magic ritual. The book is sealed in a box, with the head priest expressing the hope that the book will never be read, lest the demon be released upon the world. In the present, the book is delivered to Giles and added to a pile that Willow is scanning into a computer. Willow tells Buffy that she has formed an online relationship with a boy named Malcolm. As Buffy tries to warn Willow about the dangers of rushing into a relationship with someone she has not seen, Fritz (a computer geek) is instructed by Moloch, via the computer he is working on, to keep watch on Buffy. Later, when Xander asks Willow if she will accompany him to the Bronze, she passes, preferring to talk to Malcolm. When Willow arrives late the next day, Buffy finds that she missed classes to talk to \\"Malcolm\\". Suspecting that Malcolm might be catfishing Willow, Buffy asks Dave for help in finding out Malcolm's real identity, but his angry response causes her to suspect that he is Malcolm. When Buffy asks Giles for help, he confesses he cannot help her much as he finds technology to be intimidating. Willow becomes suspicious of Malcolm after she learns that he knows Buffy was kicked out of her old school, and logs off the conversation. Back at the library, Giles discovers that Moloch's book is blank. Outside of school, Dave tells Buffy that Willow wants to talk to her in the girls' locker room. At the last minute, Dave has a change of heart and warns Buffy that she is about to be electrocuted. In the library, Giles tells Buffy and Xander that demons can be imprisoned in books; if the books are read aloud, the demons are set free. Giles also explains that Moloch is an extremely powerful and seductive demon, winning his victims over with false promises of love, glory and power. Buffy and Giles realise that there is no limit to the destruction that a demon could do through the Internet. After they find Dave's body, Xander and Buffy go to Willow's house, and Buffy tells Giles to ask the computer teacher (Ms. Calendar) for help, hoping that between his knowledge of demons and her knowledge of computers, they can reimprison Moloch. Willow is kidnapped by Fritz. Giles seeks help from Ms. Calendar, and is surprised that she is already aware of the demon in the Internet. A robotic incarnation of Moloch crashes through a wall and attacks Buffy, Willow and Xander. After a brief battle, Buffy tricks Moloch into punching an electrical power line, causing his body to explode and, presumably, destroying him for good. The next day, Buffy, Willow and Xander joke about how the Hellmouth is screwing with their love lives, laughing about how none of them will ever find true happiness; suddenly, realising what they are laughing about, it ceases to be funny. Production \\"I, Robot... You, Jane\\" features the first appearance of Jenny Calendar. Although her first name was not mentioned, the script called her Nicki. However, the name was then changed to avoid confusion on the set, where the cast and crew all call Nicholas Brendon by his nickname, Nicky.Golden, Christopher, and Nancy Holder. The Watcher's Guide, Vol. 1. New York: Pocket Books, 1998. Ms. Calendar becomes a recurring character in the second season and has a relationship with Giles, which is hinted at in this episode. When Giles listens to the radio in his office, the voice speaking is actually the uncredited voice of Joss Whedon. Broadcast and reception \\"I, Robot... You, Jane\\" was first broadcast on The WB on April 28, 1997. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.3 on its original airing. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was critical of the episode, giving it a grade of D+ because it was \\"corny, tonally off and lacking even the illusion of depth that other slack episodes have provided in Season One\\". He felt that it was \\"frustrating in its lack of extra levels, because there are so many places that episode could've gone\\", and also found some \\"odd\\" things about the episode, such as the sudden appearance of other students in the library. However, he was positive towards the final scene and Ms. Calendar. DVD Talk's Phillip Duncan was more positive, writing that \\"What could have easily been a silly plot is made all the better with an excellent set-up, the introduction of another key player, and the continued focus on characters other than Buffy.\\" A review from the BBC was also positive, writing, \\"Although the plot is rather tired and seems to belong to the Cyberspace-obsessed eighties, it's given a unique Buffy The Vampire Slayer spin or three to create a very satisfying episode.\\" The review praised the focus on Willow and the way Moloch was presented.

The episode's teleplay was written by David Greenwalt, with a story by Joss Whedon, and directed by Bruce Seth Green. The episode originally aired on May 12, 1997, attracting a Nielsen rating of 2.5. The episode is about the students at Sunnydale High beginning to experience aspects of their worst nightmares while awake, leading the Scooby Gang's investigation to a young boy with a secret. However, before they can get to the bottom of things, they must face their own nightmares, which are rapidly taking over reality. Summary The episode begins with Buffy having a nightmare about going to The Master's lair and being choked by him. Buffy's mother, Joyce, shakes her awake, and as Buffy wakes up, she remembers that she is excited to be spending the coming weekend with her father. Buffy confides to Willow that she thinks she might have something to do with her parents' divorce. In a class, when the teacher asks Wendell to read from the text book, tarantulas crawl out of it. Buffy sees a boy standing in the doorway, saying that he is sorry. The next day, as the Master explains to Collin, the Anointed One, how wonderful he finds fear, Buffy is nervous about being picked up by her father after school, and her mother calms her down. At school, Willow and Xander are worried about the spiders, and want to talk to Giles about it. Giles mutters that he \\"got lost,\\" seemingly in the stacks of books. Giles has no information on the spiders so the gang goes to talk to Wendell, who explains he has been having recurring spider nightmares. In the meantime, Cordelia lets Buffy know about a history test that Buffy has not studied for. Buffy has a hard time even finding the class, and the test is over in what feels like a moment; Buffy has not even filled in her name. She once again sees the same boy outside the classroom. As break-time begins, a girl named Laura takes a smoking break in the basement. An ugly man comes out of the shadows and says, \\"lucky nineteen\\" before assaulting Laura. Later, Buffy and Giles interview Laura in the hospital, where they hear about \\"lucky nineteen.\\" They also find the young boy from before (Billy), in a coma due to a similar attack. More nightmarish instances start to occur, starting with Xander finding that all of his clothing has vanished and he is naked in his classroom. Giles now cannot read but he finds a picture of Billy. Cordelia's hair becomes a disheveled, spiky mess, her designer clothes become horribly drab and nerdy, and she is physically forced to join the school chess club. Buffy realizes that she had been seeing Billy at school while he was still in a coma at the hospital. Giles theorizes she might have been seeing Billy's astral projection. Buffy's father shows up and calmly tells her that she is at fault for her parents' divorce, because she is such a difficult child and he can't stand being around her. Then he scolds her for crying at his hurtful accusations and tells her he never wants to see her again. The Scooby Gang quickly figures out that their nightmares are becoming reality, including Xander's nightmare of being chased by a clown and Willow's nightmare of appearing on stage, expected to perform Madama Butterfly. Buffy finds Billy's astral body, and then they are both found by the man who assaulted Laura. Nightmares plague everyone and Buffy learns Billy has experienced some sort of punishment for poor baseball skills. They evade the scary man and find themselves in a graveyard where The Master confronts Buffy, and buries her alive. Meanwhile, Willow, Xander and Giles find Buffy's grave. Giles explains that it is his worst nightmare to let Buffy die on his watch. Buffy then crawls out of the grave as a vampire, revealing her worst nightmare is dying and becoming a vampire herself. The gang decides that they must wake up Billy from his coma to stop the nightmares. In the hospital, they find Billy's astral body near Billy's comatose body. As the ugly man finds him, Buffy confronts him. After knocking him out, she encourages Billy to face him. Billy wakes up and everything is back to normal. Billy's Kiddie League coach shows up, and refers to him as his \\"lucky nineteen\\". Buffy realizes he must be the \\"ugly man\\" who put Billy into a coma after they lost the game. He tries to run after Buffy confronts him, but is stopped by Giles and Xander and arrested. The episode ends when Buffy and her father leave for their weekend together, the previous confrontation just an unreal nightmare. Production details A line of Xander's and an exchange between Giles and Buffy was cut from the original script due to length:Golden, Christopher, and Nancy Holder. The Watcher's Guide, Vol. 1.

The story was conceived by series creator and executive producer Joss Whedon and co-executive producer David Greenwalt, with Greenwalt penning the teleplay. It was directed by John T. Kretchmer, the second and final episode he directed for the show. The narrative intertwines two stories, one of Spike and Drusilla, legendary vampires from Angel's past, coming to Sunnydale and Buffy Summers' attempts to keep her mother and Principal Snyder from meeting at parent-teacher night, which she has to organize. Unfortunately for her, this is when Spike chooses to attack. Plot Principal Snyder assigns Buffy and Sheila Martini (Alexandra Johnes) to prepare the school lounge for parent-teacher night. Principal Snyder is considering expelling these two, but if they do a good job in Parent-teacher night he won't expel them. A new pair of vampires arrive in town, Spike and Drusilla. Spike promises the Anointed One (Andrew J. Ferchland) that he will kill Buffy, as he has killed two slayers already. While the Scoobies are busy preparing for the parents, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte) show up to inform Buffy that Saturday will be the Night of Saint Vigeous, named after the leader of a vampire crusade, and that during that night, the natural abilities of vampires will be enhanced. Spike tells Buffy that he will kill her on Saturday. He later kidnaps and brings Sheila, who is enthralled by his bad boy charms, to the weak Drusilla who feeds on and kills her. Giles does not recognize Spike from Buffy's description. Angel walks in on the meeting and tells them that Spike is a large problem, and then leaves. Angel and Spike knew each other for a long time. Later, Giles finds a reference to Spike as \\"William the Bloody,\\" and discovers that he has indeed killed two slayers. On Thursday night, the Scoobies are making weapons in the library while Buffy is preparing the buffet. She fails to keep Snyder from meeting her mother. Afterwards, a stern Joyce orders Buffy home just as Spike and the other vampires crash through the window. In the ensuing fight, Buffy leads the adults to safety in the science room. Xander is sent to fetch Angel. Buffy takes command of the incredulous adults, tells them to stay put and climbs through the air ducts to reach the library and her weapons. Buffy's location in the ceiling is discovered when Spike hears noises, and she has to avoid strikes made by the vampires to knock her down. After taking out the vampires trying to break into the science room, she runs into Sheila, who is now a vampire. At first, Buffy doesn't realize this, but she is able to thwart Sheila's attempt to ambush her thanks to Giles. Xander returns to the school with Angel, who pretends to be his former evil self, Angelus. Though Spike first welcomes Angelus as a long-lost friend, he sees through the ruse and Xander and Angel are forced to flee. Buffy and Spike finally meet in the hall, and fight. Spike seemingly has Buffy beaten and is about to kill her, but she is saved when her mother shows up and hits Spike over the head with the flat of an axe. Hurt, Spike flees the scene. Joyce tells Buffy that she trusts Buffy to take care of herself, whatever Snyder may say. Snyder tells the police chief to say that the trouble was caused by a gang on PCP. When the chief wonders if people will believe it, Snyder asks if the chief would rather that he tell the truth. Spike returns to the vampire lair, where the Anointed One demands penance for his failure. After starting to go through the motions, Spike simply throws the boy into a cage and raises it into the sunlight.

It was written by Marti Noxon and originally aired on January 12, 1998. Buffy must contend with vampire cowboys the Gorch brothers and the bezoar, a prehistoric parasite.  Plot  Buffy and her mother Joyce are shopping at a mall when Buffy notices a vampire leading a girl into a closed arcade. Buffy fights off the vampire who is later found to be a semi-notorious vampire named Lyle who travels with his brother Tector. At school the next day, Cordelia and Xander make out in a closet despite the fact they both continue to bicker and agree they do not want a relationship. In health class, the teacher, Mr. Whitmore asks the students to pair off to take care of an egg. That night, Buffy's egg breaks open and a tentacle emerges, attaching itself to her face and inserting a tendril into her ear. The next morning when she wakes up, the egg is back to normal, but Buffy is feeling ill. Back at the library, Giles comments on how both Buffy and Willow appear to be very tired and sluggish, both passing it off as a bad night's sleep. That night, a security guard enters the school basement and finds a large hole in the wall, only to be knocked unconscious by Mr. Whitmore. Arriving home, Buffy sees her egg hatching. Suddenly a creature emerges and attempts to attach itself to her body. Buffy finally manages to stab it with a pair of scissors, before phoning Willow to warn her. Willow assures Buffy that she is fine, but her egg is seen to already be hatched. The next day, a creature is seen to have attached itself to Willow's back. Xander, who has hard-boiled his egg, decides to eat it, only to find a dead creature inside. The Scooby Gang proceed to the science lab to dissect the creature. However, Cordelia's egg hatches and the creature attaches to her, instructing her to knock Buffy unconscious, while Willow hits Xander over the head with a microscope. They drag Buffy and Xander to a closet, before joining a large group of students who pick up tools and head into the basement. Joyce arrives at the library to pick up Buffy, however she instead encounters Giles, who places a creature on her back. They both then go into the basement. Buffy and Xander regain consciousness and find two unhatched eggs in the closet. Buffy smashes them, before they go to the library. Buffy finds a book describing the creatures who attach themselves to and then control a host, under the instructions of 'the mother Bezoar', an ancient, subterranean parasite. They follow a student into the basement and through the hole, where they find the host group digging up the mother Bezoar. Buffy decides to kill the mother Bezoar. However, Lyle and Tector arrive and attack Buffy. The fight eventually ends up in the working pit, where Willow orders the others to kill them. While fending off the hosts, Tector is grabbed by a tentacle and eaten by the mother Bezoar. Buffy is also seized by a tentacle, but she manages to grab a pick-axe which she uses to kill the mother Bezoar from the inside out, thus killing the creatures and freeing the hosts and scaring Lyle away. Critical reception The A.V. Club said it offered a take on the same material as the episode \\"Ted\\", with its themes about good parenting. However they found it lighter in tone and more action-packed. It also advances the theme that sex has consequences, which relates to events later in the season when Buffy and Angel consummate their relationship.

It was written by series story editors Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali, and first broadcast on January 27, 1998. Plot Cordelia and Xander are attacked by a werewolf that rips a hole in their car's roof. Giles points out that there have been several other attacks, though so far only animals have been killed. During high school gym class, it is revealed that at least two students have been bitten lately: Oz by a cousin, and school macho Larry by a dog. After some research, Giles finds out that a werewolf is a wolf for three nights -- the coming night would be the second. Since the werewolf is human the rest of the month, it would be wrong to kill it. This, however, is not the view of werewolf hunter Cain who is out for his twelfth pelt. Buffy and Giles rush to The Bronze, where the werewolf crashes the party. Buffy tries to catch it with a chain but fails. Cain joins them and points out that it will be Buffy's fault if the werewolf kills anybody. A body does turn up the next morning: Theresa, one of the students. Buffy is not the only one to have feelings of guilt. Oz wakes up in the forest, naked and confused after changing back from his wolf state. Recalling the bite he got, he calls his Aunt Maureen, and bluntly asks if his cousin is a werewolf. Xander figures that Larry is the most obvious suspect because of the dog bite. When he confronts Larry alone in the gym locker room, it turns out that he really is hiding his homosexuality. Xander unwittingly leaves Larry with the impression that Xander is gay, too. Back in the library, Buffy suggests to Willow that she might have to make the first move if she wants to speed things up with Oz. Buffy realizes that the reports of Theresa's body did not mention any mauling. She and Xander get to the funeral home in time to watch her rise as a vampire. Theresa passes along greetings from Angelus before Xander stakes her. Buffy is left shaken by this and Xander comforts her. Cain busies himself casting silver bullets for the hunt. Willow visits Oz right before sundown. Oz is about to chain himself up, but lets Willow in the house. Her rant about the mixed signals he is sending is interrupted by him changing into a werewolf. She flees the house screaming, Oz in pursuit. Cain hears the wolf's cry and joins the hunt. The werewolf is distracted by a scent which Cain set as a trap, and Willow escapes and then finds Giles and Buffy, who are about to start the hunt for Oz with a tranquilizer gun. All parties meet in a clearing in the forest, and in the scuffle, it is Willow who shoots Oz, saving everybody. Buffy bends Cain's gun with her bare hands using Slayer strength, and tells him to leave Sunnydale. At school the next morning, Oz and Willow share their first kiss. Themes In an essay exploring the feminist ethics of Buffy, Shannon Craigo-Snell uses this episode as an example of how the series examines the threat of sexual violence facing women and girls as a \\"problematic background against which women attempt to have satisfying relationships with men.\\" Craigo-Snell points out that this threat is embodied by the character of Larry, who sexually harasses Buffy (and other girls) during a gym class focused on self-defense, and the werewolf-hunter Cain, who says Buffy's failure to capture the werewolf is \\"what happens when a woman tries to do a man's job.\\" The theme is made explicit when Giles describes werewolves as \\"potent, extreme representation of our inborn, animalistic traits\\", predatory and aggressive with no conscience, and Buffy responds, \\"In other words, your typical male.\\"  Production details  \\"Phases\\", in which Oz becomes a werewolf, is the first of three episodes about Willow and Oz, followed by \\"Wild at Heart\\" and \\"New Moon Rising\\".Marti Noxon in DVD commentary to \\"Wild at Heart\\" Actor Jack Conley, who plays Cain in this episode, also portrays the recurring character Sahjhan in seasons three and five of Angel.BBC episode guide References  External links  * * Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2) episodes Category:1998 American television episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:Television episodes about werewolves ","title":"Phases (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"7957691","text":"\\"Ted\\" is episode 11 of season two of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was written by David Greenwalt and Joss Whedon, and guest starred John Ritter as Ted. Buffy is unable to warm to her mother's new boyfriend, Ted. When her escalating conflict has apparently lethal consequences, Buffy's guilt turns to fear‚ÄîJoyce is in far greater danger than anyone could have imagined. Plot Buffy's mother Joyce introduces her new friend, Ted Buchanan, a computer software salesman. He tells Buffy that he has been seeing Joyce for quite some time now. Buffy becomes uncomfortable with Ted's 1950s sitcom mannerisms and is not impressed by his offer of miniature golf. That night, Buffy beats a vampire to an unusually bloody pulp before killing it, worrying Giles that something is troubling her. Buffy asks Angel for his take on things. He says that her mother needs a man in her life, and she should give him the benefit of the doubt. The golf outing goes poorly. When Buffy tries to cheat out of sight of the others, Ted notices and threatens her with a slapping. Buffy talks her way into Ted's workplace where an envious co-worker tells her that he is an unbeatable salesman they have nicknamed \\"the machine\\". She also learns that he is making plans for a wedding in two months time. At dinner, Ted denies the engagement, but confesses to Joyce that he has hopes they will. Buffy slips out for some slaying and on her return, finds Ted has read her diary. He threatens to tell Joyce about the 'Slayer' unless she toes the line. She defies him and is slapped. In the resulting brawl, Ted is kicked down the stairs. Joyce declares him dead when she cannot find a pulse. The day after a talk with the police, Buffy is in a haze of guilt. Willow, Xander and Cordelia dig deeper into Ted's life‚Äîdiscovering Ted's cookies are drugged; Cordelia finds Ted has had four wives since 1957, all of whom have since disappeared. That night, while Giles patrols, Sunnydale High teacher Jenny Calendar surprises him and apologizes for avoiding him. A vampire attacks and Jenny accidentally shoots Giles with a crossbow. Giles, only slightly injured, takes the shaft out of his own body and uses it to stake the vampire. Buffy finds a reanimated Ted in her room; they fight again, and upon cutting him Buffy discovers that Ted is a robot. Ted knocks Buffy unconscious and escapes to find Joyce, but the damage he has sustained in the fight has left him erratic. Ted confronts an astonished Joyce, but as he malfunctions he reveals his true intentions; as Joyce resists, Ted becomes violent and knocks her out. Buffy then awakens, and knocks Ted out with a frying pan killing him. Meanwhile, the Scooby Gang investigates Ted's bunker which is decorated in 1950s style; Xander finds Ted's previous four wives ‚Äî all dead. The gang returns to school the next day, with Buffy cleared of all charges, and discuss their discoveries about Ted. Apparently, the real Ted Buchanan was a sickly, but brilliant, inventor in the 1950s whose wife left him. In desperation, he built a robot version of himself. The robot kidnapped Ted's wife and held her captive in his bunker until she died. The robot then sought out other women resembling Ted's dead wife and repeated the process until it met Joyce.

It originally aired on November 3, 1997. Plot In a school hallway, a young man sneaks up behind Buffy and surprises her. Buffy introduces him to Willow and Xander as her friend Ford (Billy Fordham), with whom she attended school in Los Angeles. He explains that he is finishing his senior year at Sunnydale High. At the Bronze, Ford entertains Willow and Xander with embarrassing stories about Buffy. Buffy introduces Angel to Ford, whom Angel obviously doesn't trust. In the alley behind the Bronze, Buffy stakes a vampire and Ford reveals that he knows that she is the Slayer. Angel shows up at Willow's bedroom to ask for help tracking down Ford on the internet. Willow quickly finds that Ford is not actually registered at Sunnydale High. The next night, Buffy and Ford see two vampires running onto campus. Out of sight of Buffy, Ford holds a stake to a vampire's heart and threatens to kill it unless it does what he wants. When Buffy finds Ford again he claims to have killed the vampire. Meanwhile, Xander, Willow and Angel visit the Sunset Club, the only address Willow has found for Ford. The patrons romanticize and sympathize vampires, whom they refer to as \\"the Lonely Ones,\\" and Angel cannot help but scoff. Buffy goes back to the library and meets Giles and Ms. Calendar. Buffy sees a picture of Drusilla among Giles' research. Giles explains that she was Spike's lover, supposedly killed by an angry mob in Prague, but Buffy tells him that she is still alive and that she saw her with Angel. Soon, a vampire storms out of Giles' study with a book. Buffy recognizes it as the vampire Ford said he had killed. Ford approaches Spike and asks to be made a vampire. The idea does not interest Spike until Ford explains that he can give them the Slayer in return. Later that night, Angel comes to Buffy's house to tell her about Ford's club. Buffy goes to the Sunset Club where Ford explains that he was counting on Buffy figuring out his plan. Buffy pleads with him to let the other club members go. Ford interrupts to tell her that he has brain cancer and will be dead within six months; becoming a vampire is the only way he can avoid death. He then admits to her that the other people will not be changed. Within minutes of sunset, the vampires arrive and immediately begin feeding. Ford attacks Buffy, but she knocks him out. Buffy overpowers Drusilla and threatens to stake her. Spike immediately orders the vampires to stop feeding. Buffy demands that they let everyone go, which Spike agrees to. The former vampire worshippers flee and Buffy follows. Ford is still unconscious on the floor as Buffy closes the door, locking all the vampires inside with him. Ford awakens and, since he held up his end of the bargain by luring the Slayer, demands that Spike holds up his end of the bargain and sire him. Shrugging off this latest defeat, Spike does so. A few nights later Buffy and Giles are waiting over Ford's grave. Ford's vampire self emerges and Buffy stakes her former friend, before wondering sadly if life for her as a Slayer ever gets easier.

Career A native of the Dominican Republic, Albam grew up in New York City and was attracted to jazz at an early age when heard the music of Bix Beiderbecke. He left school in his teens and played saxophone in a Dixieland band led by Muggsy Spanier. When he was with the Georgie Auld band, he learned about arranging with Budd Johnson. By 1950 Albam was concentrating less on performing and more on writing and arranging. Within a few years, he became known for a bebop style that emphasized taut and witty writing with a flair for distinctive shadings; flute-led reed sections became something of an Albam trademark. One of his most popular works from that era was an Afro-Latin composition he did for the Stan Kenton Innovations Orchestra entitled \\"Samana\\", named after his birthplace in the Dominican Republic. He worked with bandleaders Charlie Barnet and Charlie Spivak before collaborating with Count Basie, Stan Getz, Bob Brookmeyer, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard, Hank Jones, Mel Lewis, Art Farmer, Urbie Green, and Milt Hinton. Albam wrote arrangements for Leonard Bernstein's score for the musical West Side Story in 1957. The work earned him a Grammy Award nomination in 1959. He was invited by Bernstein to write for the New York Philharmonic, and he began to study classical music, eventually writing Concerto for Trombone and Strings. He also wrote music for movies, television, and commerials. In the early 1960s he became music director for Solid State Records. For the rest of his career, he taught at Glassboro State College, Eastman School of Music, and Manhattan School of Music. He helped start and lead the BMI Jazz Composers Workshop.

Career Born in Lewisham, London, Rufus progressed through the youth system at The Valley, making his debut for the club as a teenager in 1994 at the age of 19. He was capped six times by the England national under-21 team from 1996 to 1997. His most memorable moment for Charlton came at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. Charlton, having finished fourth in the First Division, were facing Sunderland in the play-off final at Wembley. With five minutes of normal time remaining, Charlton were losing 3-2 before Rufus scored his first ever senior goal from a corner, forcing the game into extra-time. After the resulting 4‚Äì4 draw, the Addicks went on to win the game 7‚Äì6 on penalties, thus gaining promotion into the Premier League. Despite being sent off in his first Premier League game against Newcastle United, Rufus developed into a key player in Charlton's ultimately unsuccessful bid to avoid relegation. He remained with the club and enjoyed a very productive 1999‚Äì2000 season scoring six goals and helping Charlton to win the First Division title. Back in the Premier League, Charlton were far more successful and remained in the top flight with ease. Rufus was tipped several times to become an England player, but Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson never chose him. Starting in 2001, Rufus began to suffer a series of injury setbacks. He missed half of the 2001‚Äì02 season and the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. He underwent a series of knee operations in 2003 and at one stage looked to have returned to first time reckoning, having appeared on the bench for a League Cup game against Luton Town. He was, however, forced to have another operation done by Richard Steadman. The operation was unsuccessful, and he was forced to retire from football in 2004 at the age of 29. His final competitive appearance for the club came against Liverpool on 21 April 2003. In his decade in Charlton's first team, he was regarded as one of the team's most important players. This was recognised by three player of the year awards and in 2005 he was voted by fans as Charlton's greatest ever defender. Since retiring, Rufus, a born again Christian, has been involved with plenty of charity work, alongside friends and fellow Christian footballers Darren Moore and Linvoy Primus, as well as occasionally doing punditry work. In May 2013, Rufus was inducted into the Charlton Athletic Hall of Fame, reflecting the reverence held by the club's supporters for this one-club man. Personal life In December 2013, Rufus was declared bankrupt after a ¬£6 million failed investment, which cost his church ¬£5m. In November 2015, Rufus was branded a fraudster by a specialist civil court judge following an ¬£8 million loss to investors. Rufus had operated a ¬£16m Ponzi scheme involving over 100 investors including members of his family and congregation members of churches he had attended. He pocketed more than ¬£3 million to fund his lifestyle. The Insolvency Service described the case as \\"one of the worst\\" ever. Rufus was given a 15-year bankruptcy restriction order. At the end of November, he left his roles with Charlton Athletic in the club's academy and the Community Trust following the fraud investigation. In August 2019, Rufus was due to appear in court in respect of foreign currency exchange fraud of up to ¬£9 million, between 2007 and 2012. An initial hearing was adjourned on 5 August and he was expected to appear on 8 August.

The parish is part of the Benefice of Stonesfield with Combe Longa. The Wychwood Way long distance footpath passes the church. History A church at Combe existed by about 1141, when the Empress Matilda granted it to the Benedictine Eynsham Abbey. In the Middle Ages, Oxfordshire was part of the Diocese of Lincoln, and in 1478 Thomas Rotherham, Bishop of Lincoln, granted St Laurence's church to Lincoln College, Oxford. The college remains patron of the Living. Parts of the building are 12th century, including the inner doorway of the north porch. The nave was rebuilt near the end of the 14th century, and is notable for its 14th- or 15th-century stone pulpit and a set of wall paintings dating from about 1440. The church has remnants of a set of 15th-century stained glass windows. The most complete survivor is one on the southeast corner of the nave depicting Saint James the Great. In the tracery at the top of the east window of the chancel survive images of Christ in Majesty with Saint Mary, flanked by cherubim and an angel using a censer. A west gallery in the nave was built or altered in 1821. Box pews were also introduced in the 1820s. In 1843 they were criticised as \\"miserable, deal pews\\" and the church as \\"white and yellow wash, dirt, and everything most offensive\\". =Restoration= Crucifixion of Jesus, painted about 1440 In 1891 a new vicar, Stephen Pearce, was appointed. He applied himself to parish work and had the church restored and the vicarage rebuilt. The church restoration was begun in 1892, when the west gallery was removed and the 15th-century wall paintings were rediscovered under the limewash on the nave walls. The surviving paintings include an Annunciation on the south wall, a crucifixion of Jesus near the pulpit, and part of a Doom painting over the chancel arch. Also on the south wall is a painting of Saint Christopher, shown with fish and an otter. On the north wall is a painting of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. In 1892‚Äì94 the nave and chancel walls were repaired and the windows were renewed. In 1907‚Äì09 the nave roof was extensively repaired. A fire in 1918 gutted the tower, which was restored in 1922. Later restoration included the tower stonework in 1952‚Äì55, the chancel roof in 1963, and the surface of the nave roof in 1976. The 1918 fire destroyed the parish chest and its contents. Some records were in the vicarage and survived, including the parish register from 1646 until 1705, some 19th-century registers, vestry minutes and churchwardens' accounts. The church is a Grade I listed building. Bells and clocks The earliest record of bells at the church is from 1585, when one had recently been cast. This must have been later recast, as in the late 19th century the dates of the bells were recorded as 1602 or 1621, 1628, 1629, 1698 and 1723, forming a ring of five. James Keene of Woodstock cast the 1628 and 1629 bells. The tower had also an historic turret clock that may have been made early in the 17th century. After the tower fire in 1918, John Taylor & Co of Loughborough recast the damaged bells as a ring of six in 1924 or 1925. The church has also an undated Sanctus bell. The 1918 fire reduced the historic clock to \\"a twisted mass of old iron.\\" In the late 1930s these remains were presented to the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, where they were restored and installed as an exhibit. Donald Harden, Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum, recognised its similarity with the Dover Castle Clock, and in 1938 he concluded that the two were by the same clockmaker. It originally had a verge escapement like the Dover clock, but later in the 17th century the Combe clock was updated with a short pendulum. John Smith and Sons of Derby supplied a new clock for the church in 1948. Perpendicular Gothic pulpit References The Patron is still Lincoln College, Oxford. The Rev'd Roy Turner.

His detainee ID number is 035. American intelligence analysts estimate he was born in 1979, in Rada, Yemen. Idris was transferred to Oman on June 13, 2015, where the Government of Oman agreed to what the Department of Defense called \\"appropriate security measures. He arrived on June 8, 2002, he was held in extrajudicial detention, and never faced criminal charges. The Department of Defense never fully released its justification for holding Idris, but on April 25, 2011, the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published his previously secret JTF-GTMO assessment. Background According to Idris he graduated from high school in 1996, and then attended Sanaa University for two years. After he dropped out, he worked for Yemen's Ministry of Agriculture. Idris says an imam at the al- Khayr Mosque in Sanaa convinced him to travel to Afghanistan to teach the Quran in 1999. Idris says he did travel to Afghanistan, and spent eight months teaching the Quran at the al Raham Mosque in Kandahar but denied ever taking any military training or participating in hostilities. He described fleeing the American Bombardment of Afghanistan, traveling alone, to Khowst on November 15, 2001. He described spending approximately 20 days in Khowst, when an Arab named Rosi Khan, helped him join with a group of approximately 30 other arabs, who planned to travel together on foot to cross the border with Pakistan. These men were apprehended by Pakistani officials on December 15, 2001. Idris was transferred to Guantanamo over six months later, on June 8, 2002. American counter-terrorism analysts came to characterize the group of men Idris was captured with as \\"the dirty thirty\\", asserting that it was a group of Osama bin Laden bodyguards. Human rights workers and legal critics challenged this characterization, as it was based on denunciations from captives using unreliable coercive interrogation techniques. Information from the public record established that the men had little in common, prior to their capture, that they had come to Afghanistan at different times, and pursued different activities there, prior to their capture. On September 21, the Department of Justice published a list of 55 captives who had been cleared for release or transfer from Guantanamo by the Guantanamo Review Task Force in 2010. On September 24, Fox News named Idris, as one of the men cleared for release -- even though he had been described as one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards. Official status reviews Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Idris Ahmed Abdu Qader Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... are associated with both Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\\" * Idris Ahmed Abdu Qader Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.\\" * Idris Ahmed Abdu Qader Idris was listed as one of the captives who was a foreign fighter. * Idris Ahmed Abdu Qader Idris was listed as one of the \\"82 detainees made no statement to CSRT or ARB tribunals or made statements that do not bear materially on the military‚Äôs allegations against them.\\" =Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment= On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts. An assessment dated January 26, 2008, was published, recommending his continued detention in Guantanamo. It was ten pages long, and was signed by Mark Buzby, the camp commandant. =Guantanamo Joint Review Task Force= When President Barack Obama took office he instituted a new review procedure the Guantanamo Joint Review Task Force, which was to report back to him, within a year, after conducting new assessments of the captives' status. The review classified the captives into three groups, those who should face charges, those who could safely be released or transferred to other countries, and a third group, too innocent to face charges, but too dangerous for the USA to release. Idris was classified as safe to release. Transfer to Oman Idris was transferred to Oman on June 13, 2015, with five other Yemenis.

His detainee ID number is 036. In July 2013, a motion was filed seeking his release because his physical and emotional health had deteriorated to the point where he could not pose a threat. On October 3, 2013, Ben Fox, of the Associated Press, reported that the United States Department of Justice had dropped its opposition to Idris's repatriation. His entry in the official list of Guantanamo captives asserts he was born in Hathramaut, Yemen, but his formerly secret Guantanamo assessment asserts he was born in Port Sudan, Sudan. According to a formerly secret Guantanamo assessment, he is a medical doctor and suspected of serving as a camp doctor for al-Qaeda on its front lines. A later review of Guantanamo assessments showed that they are unreliable, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. (p. 9)http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf Official status reviews Originally, the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... are associated with both Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges that the following detainees stayed in Al Qaeda, Taliban or other guest- or safehouses.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... were at Tora Bora.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives whose \\"names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges that the following detainees were captured under circumstances that strongly suggest belligerency.\\" * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the captives who was an \\"al Qaeda operative\\". * Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris was listed as one of the \\"82 detainees made no statement to CSRT or ARB tribunals or made statements that do not bear materially on the military's allegations against them.\\" =Mahmud Idris v. George W. Bush= Combatant Status Review Tribunal panel 13 convened on November 3, 2004, to confirm Mahmud Idris's \\"enemy combatant\\" status. A seventeen-page dossier of unclassified documents prepared for that tribunal was assembled for his habeas corpus attorneys. His habeas petition was first filed before US District Court Judge James Robertson. In September 2007, the Department of Justice published dossiers of unclassified documents arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives, including Idris's. On August 15, 2006, his case was amalgamated with al Qosi v. Bush, along with 130 others. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. In Salim Muhood Adem v. George W. Bush Civil Action No. 05-CV-00723 several dozen Guantanamo captives petitioned for relief because the Bush Presidency was not allowing the attorneys chosen by their families to meet with them. The Department of Justice was claiming the attorneys were not providing evidence that the captives had authorized them to act as their attorneys. US District Court Judge Alan Kay ruled a previous judicial rulings had not required that attorneys prove they had been authorized prior to visiting with a captive. The previous ruling had merely required that the captive explicitly authorize the attorney within ten days of that first visit. Kay declined to rule that the Bush administration was in contempt. On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated. On July 18, 2008, Jennifer R. Cowan of DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON LLP re-initiated Civil Action No. 05-CV-1555 on behalf of Ibrahim Osman Ibrahim Idris. On June 28, 2013, Cowan filed a motion which Carol Rosenberg, of the Miami Herald described as \\"a novel twist\\" in habeas petitions, in that it ignored assertions of the threat Idris posed, prior to his capture. The motion argues \\"he's too fat, too crazy and too physically sick to be a danger in the future. So Lamberth should send him home.\\" Rosenberg notes the motion cites \\"Army regulations that recommend repatriation of POWs who are so sick they can't recover\\", and that the \\"Geneva Conventions require a war prisoner be sent home if his mental or physical fitness 'have been gravely diminished.'\\" =Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment= On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts. A ten-page assessment was drafted at Joint Task Force Guantanamo on April 15, 2008. That assessment was signed by camp commandant Mark Buzby and recommended his continued detention in Guantanamo. He was described as a \\"low threat\\" prisoner, which Carol Rosenberg, of the Miami Herald, explained meant he was compliant, and didn't represent a threat to JTF-GTMO staff. She reported the assessment \\"advised against his release, in part, because he 'resisted cooperation with interrogators and remains largely unexploited' ‚Äî meaning he had yet to spill any al-Qaida secrets.\\" She noted that the report described his health as \\"fair\\", completely skipping over serious mental and physical health issues that were made public in a July 2013 update to his habeas petition. =Guantanamo Joint Task Force= In 2009, shortly after he took office, United States President Barack Obama created a new Guantanamo Joint Task Force, with officials seconded from a range of Federal agencies, to conduct brand new assessment of captives' status. That review recommended that Idris be repatriated to Sudan. Idris's health Idris's \\"disorganized schizophrenia\\" is so profound that when he was brought to a phone room, like this one, he was too confused to understand he was expected to pick up the phone's handset. A July 2013 habeas corpus filing argued that he should be repatriated because he had health problems so severe that he could never pose a threat to the USA‚Äîeven if he wanted to. Summarizing the report, Carol Rosenberg of the Miami Herald noted that he had been diagnosed with mental health problems shortly after his arrival in Guantanamo in 2002. He had since been diagnosed as having \\"schizophrenia, disorganized type.\\" Rosenberg described how, when he was last scheduled to have a phone call to his habeas attorney, and was brought to the phone room, he was too confused to realize he should raise the phone's handset to his face. Idris is reported to have occasional \\"lucid periods,\\" but at other times he has fits of laughter, for no reason, sings at random, and wears his underwear on his head, and that his bizarre behavior disturbed his fellow prisoners. The habeas filing said that Idris was now morbidly obese, had diabetes, and circulatory problems. According to Rosenberg, if the habeas motion succeeded, and he was repatriated, Sudan's culture and health infrastructure was insufficient for there to be any hope he would recover. Idris was transferred to Sudan on December 19, 2013.

He was not only one of the foremost scholars of his day in the physical sciences as well as in Aristotelean philosophy but also a great computist. Anatolius is considered a saint by both the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Church. His feast day, like the one of his namesake Saint Anatolius of Constantinople, is celebrated on July 3.Acta Sanctorum I (5th century) July Life Anatolius was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt, during the early 3rd century. Prior to becoming one of the great lights of the Church, Anatolius enjoyed considerable prestige at Alexandria. According to Eusebius of Caesarea, he was credited with a rich knowledge of arithmetic, geometry, physics, rhetoric, dialectic, and astronomy.Mc Carthy & Breen (2003) 18 Also according to Eusebius, Anatolius was deemed worthy to maintain the school of the Aristotelian succession in Alexandria.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 7.32.6. The pagan philosopher Iamblichus studied among his disciples for a short time.Eunapius, Lives of the Philosophers and Sophists There are fragments of ten books on arithmetic written by him. There is also a treatise on time of the Paschal celebration.Michaud & Michaud (1811‚Äì1855) 94 His famous 19-year Paschal cycle has survived in seven different complete medieval manuscripts of the Latin text De ratione paschali.Mc Carthy & Breen (2003) 25‚Äì43 A story is told by Eusebius of the way in which Anatolius broke up a rebellion in a part of Alexandria known then as Bruchium. It was held by the forces of Zenobia, and being strictly beleaguered by the Romans was in a state of starvation. Anatolius, who was living in Bruchium at the time, made arrangements with the besiegers to receive all the women and children, as well as the old and infirm, continuing at the same time to let as many as wished profit by the means of escaping. It broke up the defence and the rebels surrendered.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 7.32.6‚Äì13 In going to Laodicea he was seized by the people and made bishop. Whether his friend Eusebius had died, or whether they both occupied the see together, is a matter of much discussion. The question is treated at length in the Bollandists. Anatolius as the pioneer for the mainstream medieval computus Around AD 260 Anatolius invented the first Metonic 19-year lunar cycle (which 19-year periodic sequence of dates of the Paschal full moon must not be confused with the Metonic cycle, of which it is an application in the Julian calendar).Declercq (2000) 65‚Äì66 Therefore, Anatolius can be considered to be the founder of the new Alexandrian computus paschalis which half a century after began with the active construction of the second version of the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, which itself or a close variant of which ultimately would prevail throughout Christendom for a long time (until the year 1582, when the Julian calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar).Declercq (2000) 65‚Äì66 The seventeen-centuries-old enigma of his famous 19-year Paschal cycle (not to be confused with the Paschal cycle of the Eastern Orthodox Church) was recently completely resolved by the Irish scholars Daniel Mc Carthy and Aidan Breen.Mc Carthy & Breen (2003) 15‚Äì143 The dates of the ultimately resulting classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle have recently appeared to be advanced by about two days over the dates of Anatolius‚Äô 19-year lunar cycle.Zuidhoek (2017) 87‚Äì93 The former began somewhere in the 4th century, as evidenced by Ethiopic copies of Alexandrian tables covering three lunar cycles from 310/11 to 367/68.Neugebauer (2016) 26‚Äì27, 37, 92‚Äì94. The dates are secured by the inclusion of an indiction column, and the included Easter dates are consistent with the later dates of Dionysius Exiguus and Bede. The classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle itself or a close variant of it was added to the festal letters of Athanasius during the late 4th century;Schaff (1892) 885-892Neugebauer (2016) 92‚Äì95\\"Index\\" (1854) xv‚ÄìxxviiJones (1943) 22‚Äì26 it was used by Annianus in his 532-year tables during the early 5th century,Neugebauer (2016) 113 was fully enumerated in the subsequent 532-year Ethiopic tables,Neugebauer (2016) 50‚Äì57 and was adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria (without any mention of a 532-year table).Mosshammer (2008) 202‚Äì203 However, the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle which was added to Athanasius‚Äô Festal Letters was a one which had 6 April instead of 5 April.Mosshammer (2008) 202 Furthermore, Otto Neugebauer (1899-1990), according to himself, was in the dark about the date of compilation of the whole 7980-year framework (based on the classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle) created by Alexandrian computists.Neugebauer (1979) 98 Considering that only around AD 400 Annianus obtained his classical Alexandrian version of the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle by adapting Theophilus‚Äô 19-year lunar cycle by moving its saltus 1 year forward by replacing its date 6 April by 5 April,Mosshammer (2008) 202-203 we may conclude that the compilation in question dates from the fifth century. Of course, this does not exclude that the (in principle tentative) version constructed in the first quarter of the fourth century could be, by chance, equal to Annianus‚Äô ultimately definitive one. In any case, this possible equality cannot be assured in the way Neugebauer tried to prove it, because the particular Metonic 19-year lunar cycle of the not-dated manuscript concerning AD 311-369 he staged,Neugebauer (1979) 99 could have been obtained afterwards by simply extrapolating from the fifth century 7980-year framework. Moreover, Neugebauer not only ignored the difference between the classical Alexandrian and the Festal Index 19-year lunar cycle, but also kept us guessing about, at least refrained from showing, the (crucial) position of the saltus in the particular Metonic 19-year lunar cycle in question.Neugebauer (1979) 98-100 Anatolius describes the vernal equinox as a section of the first zodiacal sign from March 22 to 25. Although he defines March 22 as the Sun's entry into the first sign, he never defines it as his equinox, but as Ptolemy's equinox. This does not exclude that in reality he used Ptolemy's equinox as the theoretical lower limit date for all of his dates of Paschal full moon. As a matter of fact, the corresponding de facto lower limit date (necessarily being either 22 or 23 March) is not 22 but 23 March, which easily can be derived from Anatolius‚Äô Paschal table.Mc Carthy & Breen (2003) 68 In contrast, he used not only Ptolemy's but also the Roman equinox, March 25, in his Paschal table.Mc Carthy and Breen (2003) 101 Notes References Sources *Acta Sanctorum I (5th century) July *Georges Declercq (2000) Anno Domini (the Origins of the Christian Era): Turnhout () *Michaud Fr√®res (1811‚Äì1855) Biographie universelle: Paris Lives of the Saints, Omer Englebert, New York: Barnes & Noble, 1994, pp 532, (casebound) *Daniel P.

He was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001. Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts estimate Nag Mohammed was born on May 4, 1975, in Ghulja, Xinjiang, China. Edham Mamet is one of the 22 Uighurs held in Guantanamo for many years despite the fact that it became clear early on that they were innocent.China's Uighurs trapped at Guantanamo , Asia Times, November 4, 2004 He won his habeas corpus in 2008. Judge Ricardo Urbina declared his detention as unlawful and ordered to set him free in the United States. He was sent to Palau in October 2009. Determined not to be an enemy combatant after all The Department of Justice announced on September 30, 2008, that Nag Mohammed, and the sixteen other Uyghurs who remained in Guantanamo, would no longer be treated as enemy combatants. Writ of Habeas Corpus A writ of habeas corpus, Nag Mohammed v. George W. Bush, was submitted on Nag Mohammed's behalf. In response, on September 19, 2005, the Department of Defense released 30 pages of unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. =Denial of transfer to the USA= US District Court Judge Ricardo Urbina had scheduled the session where the Executive Branch would file the evidence that justified classifying the remaining Uyghurs as \\"enemy combatants\\" for October 7, 2008. On September 30, 2008, Gregory G. Katsas, the United States' Assistant Attorney General \\"notice of status\\" stated that the seventeen remaining Uyghur captives would no longer be treated as enemy combatants. Lawyers for the Uyghurs pointed out that some of the Uyghurs remained in solitary confinement in Camp 6. And the Department of Defense agreed that since the men were no longer to be treated as enemy combatants they would all be transferred to Camp Iguana. On October 7, 2008, when the Department of Justice did not file the evidence justifying classifying the Uyghurs as enemy combatants, he issued an order requiring the Department of Defense to bring the Uyghurs to his court on October 10, 2008. On October 8, 2008, the Department of Justice filed an Emergency Motion. A three judge panel of Judges in the Washington Court of Appeals granted the Executive Branch a brief respite from complying with Judge Urbina's order. The panel schedule its hearing of the Executive Branch's justification for October 20, 2008. On October 16, 2008, the Department of Justice filed its justification for restriction Asylum in Palau In June 2009, the government of Palau announced that they would offer temporary asylum to some of the Uyghurs. The government of Palau sent a delegation Guantanamo, and interviewed some of the remaining Uyghurs. Some of the Uyghurs declined to be interviewed by the Palauns. In the end the government of Palau offered asylum to twelve of the remaining thirteen Uyghurs. Palau declined to offer asylum to one of the Uyghurs who suffered from a mental disorder, brought on by detention, that was too profound to be treated in Palau. On October 31, 2009 \\"Edham Mamet\\", Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori were released and transferred to Palau. On June 29, 2015, Nathan Vanderklippe, reporting in The Globe and Mail, wrote that all the Uyghurs had quietly left Palau. The Globe confirmed that Palau's agreement to give refuge to the Uyghurs was reached after the USA agreed to various secret payments. Those payments included $93,333 to cover each Uyghurs living expenses. The Globe confirmed that controversy still surrounded former President Johnson Toribiong who had used some of those funds to billet the Uyghurs in houses belonging to his relatives. Vanderklippe reported that the men had never felt they could fit in with the Palauns. Some of the men compared Palau with a lusher, larger Guantanamo. Some of the men were able to bring their wives to Palau. Attempts to hold most regular jobs failed, due to cultural differences. Attempts to use their traditional leather-working skills to be self-employed failed. Eventually, all six men were employed as night-time security guards, a job that did not require interaction with Palauns. Tragically, one of the men's young toddler, conceived and born on Palau, died after he fell off a balcony. According to Vanderklippe, the men's departure from Palau was quietly arranged with cooperation with American officials. He reported they left, one or two at a time, on commercial flights. Palaun officials would not share the Uyghurs destination.

As well as a cycling track, it was used for ice hockey, wrestling, boxing, roller- skating, circuses, bullfighting, spectaculars, and demonstrations. It was the first permanent indoor track in France and the name persisted for other indoor tracks built subsequently. In July 1942, French police, acting under orders from the German authorities in Occupied Paris, used the velodrome to hold thousands of Jews and others who were victims in a mass arrest. The Jews were held at the velodrome before they were moved to a concentration camp in the Parisian suburbs at Drancy and then to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. The incident became known as the \\"Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup\\" (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv'). Origins The original track was housed in the Salles des Machines, the building used for the industrial display of the World's Fair, which ended in 1900. The building was unoccupied after the exhibition. In 1902, the Salle des Machines was inspected by Henri Desgrange, who the following year inaugurated the Tour de France on behalf of the newspaper that he edited, L'Auto. With him were Victor Goddet, the newspaper's treasurer, an engineer named Durand, and an architect, Gaston Lambert. It was Lambert who said he could turn the hall into a sports arena with a track 333 metres long and eight metres wide.Grunwald, Liliane, and Claude Cattaert, Le Vel' d'Hiv' : 1903‚Äì1959 (Paris: √âditions Ramsay, 1979), . He finished it in 20 days. The first meeting there, on 20 December 1903, had an audience of 20,000. They paid seven francs for the best view and a single franc to see hardly anything at all. The seating was primitive and there was no heating. The first event was not a cycle race but a walking competition over 250 metres. The first cycling competition was a race ridden behind pacing motorcycles. Only one rider‚ÄîCissac‚Äîmanaged to complete the , the others having crashed on the unaccustomed steepness of the track banking. Change of name and track In 1909 the Salle des Machines was listed for demolition to improve the view of the Eiffel Tower. Desgrange moved to another building nearby, at the corner of the boulevard de Grenelle and the rue N√©laton. The venue was named the V√©lodrome d'Hiver.Architecture et sport en France 1918-1945: une histoire politique et culturelle; www.archi.fr/DOCOMOMO-FR/sport-paris.htm, retrieved November 2007 The new track, also designed by Lambert, was 253.16m round at the base but exactly 250m on the line ridden by the motor-paced riders (considered the stars of the day). Lambert built two tiers of seats, which towered above bankings so steep for their day that they were considered cliff- like. In the track centre, Lambert built a roller-skating rink of 2,700 square metres. He lit the whole lot with 1,253 hanging lamps. There could be so many spectators jammed in the track centre for cycling events that they resembled passengers in the Paris m√©tro in the rush hour.Chany, Pierre (1988) La Fabuleuse Histoire du Cyclisme, Nathan, France The richer and more knowledgeable spectators bought track-side seats and the rest crowded into the upper balcony from which the track looked a distant bowl. A rivalry grew between those in the top row and those below them, to the extent that those on high sometimes threw sausages, bread rolls and even bottles onto those below or, if they could throw that far, onto the track. The hall's managers had to install a net to catch the larger missiles. Six-days Six-day cycle racing had started in London in the 19th century but became truly popular after changing to a race not for individuals but for teams of two. Created at Madison Square Garden (after New York prohibited . it became known in English as the madison and in French as l'am√©ricaine. The first such six-day race at the Vel' d'Hiv' started on 13 January 1913. The riders included the Tour de France winners Louis Trousselier and √âmile Georget and other prominent riders such as Octave Lapize. The race began at 6pm and by 9pm all 20,000 seats were sold. Among those who watched was the millionaire Henri de Rothschild, who offered a prize of 600 Fr, and the dancer Mistinguett, who offered 100Fr. The winners were Goulet and Fogler, an American-Australian pairing. Singer and actress, Mistinguett The Franco-American writer Ren√© de Latour said: \\"I have known the time when it was considered quite a feat to get into the Vel' d'Hiv' during a six-day race. There were mounted police all round the block, barriers were erected some way from the building, and if you did not have a ticket or a pass to show, you were not allowed anywhere near the place. You can guess that the disappointed fans often produced a near-riot.\\"De Latour, Ren√©: Adieu - Vel' d'Hiv', Sporting Cyclist, UK, 1959 A tradition started in 1926 of electing a Queen of the Six, whose job included starting the race. Among them were √âdith Piaf, Annie Cordy and the accordionist Yvette Horner, who also played from the roof of a car while preceding the Tour de France. Races at the Vel' d'Hiv' were sometimes doubted for their genuineness. While the spectacle drew large and even capacity crowds, the best riders were rumoured to control the race. The French journalist Pierre Chany wrote: : > There was a lot of talk about the relative honesty of the results, and > journalists sometimes asked themselves what importance they ought to place > on victories in these six-day races. The best of the field combined between > themselves, it was known, to fight against other teams and to get their own > hands on the biggest prizes, which they then shared between them.

Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway aboard his yacht, the Pilar, ca. mid 1950sThe American writer Ernest Hemingway was a regular fan of six-day and other races at the Vel' d'Hiv' while he lived in Paris. He wrote: : > I have started many stories about bicycle racing but have never written one > that is as good as the races are both on the indoor and outdoor tracks and > on the roads.

Boxing Boxing began at the Vel' d'Hiv' after a meeting between an American, Jeff Dickson, and Henri Desgrange, the track's main owner and leading promoter. Dickson arrived in France from Missouri in 1917 as a \\"sammie\\". Sammies, named after the owner of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, were cameramen sent from the U.S. to film American soldiers in World War I. Dickson stayed on in France after the war and began promoting boxing in the Wagram area of Paris. He and Desgrange got on and the two agreed he should organise a first boxing tournament at the Vel' d'Hiv' in 1929. The main match pitted Milou Pladner against Frankie Genaro, bringing in 920,110Fr. The Lion Hunt and other spectacles Dickson joined the management of the Vel' d'Hiv'. In 1931 he renovated the building to allow other uses in the centre of the cycling track: he removed several pillars that blocked the view of some spectators, took up the roller-skating rink, laid an ice rink of 60m by 30m, and constructed a cover for the rink to allow its use for other activities. The building was rechristened the ‚ÄúPalais des Sports de Grenelle‚Äù, though its former name remained in use.Tristan Alric, ‚ÄúUn si√®cle de hockey en France‚Äù, p. 23 Under Dickson, the Vel' d'Hiv' became home to the Fran√ßais Volants ice hockey team. The rink also featured skating shows by Sonja Henie and Holiday on Ice (1950 to 1958). His most spectacular venture was his greatest and most expensive flop. Dickson discovered from the newspaper Paris-Midi that the Schneider circus in Naples was auctioning 100 lions. Dickson bought the animals the same day, along with their cages and trailers, for 80,000Fr. He constructed a stage set, acquired two sick camels abandoned by a circus at Maisons-Alfort, hired fire-eaters and employed 20 actors to dress as African explorers‚Äîall to stage a spectacle called The Lion Hunt. The lions, however, arrived from Naples feeling tired and limp. Dickson assured reporters they needed only a meal and began importing dead animals from local abattoirs. Things didn't improve. On the first night of the show, all 100 lions were released into the arena but showed no signs of excitement, much less ferocity. Dickson ordered his \\"explorers\\" to fire into the air to wake them up. The air became bitter with cordite fumes but the lions did little more than stroll about and urinate on the scenery. Now convinced the animals were harmless, stagehands began beating them, at which children began to cry and parents shouted angry protests. The organizers withdrew the animals and moved to the next act of the show. Things went little better. The camels refused to walk in a line as in a desert caravan. And their attendants, who were unemployed black people recruited from the streets, stumbled in the sand under their unaccustomed stage clothing. The show's run was abandoned. Dickson now had two camels and 100 lions that he no longer needed. An assistant tied the camels behind a car, led them to the Seine and abandoned them. There they were found by the police. Eventually Dickson rented the camels and lions to another circus for 10,000Fr a week, only for the circus to fail and Dickson to be summoned to collect his animals. By now he was also being pursued by the for cruelty in abandoning the camels. The animals were finally sent to a zoo near Hamburg. The venture ended with the loss of 700,000Fr by the Vel' d'Hiv'. Dickson returned to America in 1939 and died when his bomber was shot down at St-Andr√©-de-l'Eure on 14 July, France's national day, in 1943. He is buried in the American cemetery at Omaha Beach west of Caen, beneath the third cross in the front row.Goddet, Jacques (1991) L'√âquip√©e Belle, Robert Laffont, France =Other spectacles= * Naissance d'une cit√© was organised by Jean-Richard Bloch on 18 October 1937 as part of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. *The V√©lodrome d'Hiver was also the venue of the 1951 European basketball championship. Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup The Vel' d'Hiv' was available for hire to whoever wanted it. Among those who booked was Jacques Doriot, who led France's largest fascist party, the PPF. It was at the Vel' d'Hiv', among other venues, that Doriot, with his Hitler-like salute, roused crowds to join his cause. In 1940, the Germans invaded France and occupied its northern half, including Paris. On 7 June 1942, they completed plans for (\\"Operation Spring Breeze\\") to arrest 28,000 Jews using 9,000 French policemen. Arrests started early on 16 July and were complete by the next day. Among those who helped in the round-up were 3,400 young members of Doriot's PPF. Commemorative plaque to the victims held in the Vel' d'Hiv' after the 16‚Äì17 July 1942 roundup of Jews in Paris. Needing a place to hold the detainees, the Germans demanded the keys of the Vel' d'Hiv' from its owner, Jacques Goddet, who had taken over from his father Victor and from Henri Desgrange. The circumstances in which Goddet surrendered the keys remain a mystery, and the episode occupies only a few lines in his autobiography. The Vel' d'Hiv' had a glass roof, which had been painted dark blue to help avoid attracting bomber navigators. The dark glass roof, combined with windows screwed shut for security, raised the temperature inside the structure. The 13,152 people held thereLe Figaro, 22 July 2002 had no lavatories; of the 10 available, five were sealed because their windows offered a way out, and the others were blocked.\\"The track that died of shame\\", Procycling, UK, 2002 The arrested Jews were kept there for five days with only water and food brought by Quakers, the Red Cross and the few doctors and nurses allowed to enter. Those arrested were sent to an internment camp in half-completed tower blocks at Drancy and then to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. Only 400 survived. Post-war track encounter An enthusiast, John Aulton, described the track in the first years after the war. He visited Paris on a tour organised for English schoolchildren who slept in tents in the grounds of a lyc√©e. He was alone in wanting to see the V√©lodrome d'Hiver. He wrote: > :I set out on my Raleigh Sports.... I arrived elated and full of > anticipation but my joy was short-lived, all the doors were locked and > barred and there was no sign of life. Without warning a side door flew open > and a small powerfully built man came hurtling out of the gloom into the > sunlight.

I gave the door another swift kick and shouted in English that all > I wanted was to see the famous track.

The stars were Roger Rivi√®re, Jacques Anquetil, Fausto Coppi and Andr√© Darrigade. The race was run with teams of three. Rivi√®re had to drop out after a crash with Anquetil in the first hours; on 12 November, Darrigade won the biggest prime, or intermediate prize, ever offered at the track: one million francs. The overall winners were Anquetil and his partners, Darrigade and Terruzzi. The building had grown old, dirty and dusty and leaked when it rained. Electricity cables hung in loops. The final night at the Vel' d'Hiv' was 12 May 1959, featuring the painter Salvador Dal√≠. Among his stage props was a model of the Eiffel Tower, which he exploded to symbolise the end of the exhibition hall in which he stood. A fire destroyed part of the V√©lodrome d'Hiver in 1959 and the rest of the structure was demolished. A block of flats and a building belonging to the Ministry of the Interior now stand on the site. Government apology For decades the French government declined to apologize for the role of French policemen in the round-up or for any other state complicity. It was argued (by de Gaulle and others) that the French Republic had been dismantled when Philippe P√©tain instituted a new French State during the war and that the Republic had been re-established after the war had ended. It was not for the Republic, therefore, to apologise for events that happened while it had not existed and which had been carried out by a state which it did not recognise. For example, former President Fran√ßois Mitterrand had maintained this position. The claim was more recently reiterated by Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front Party, during the 2017 election campaign. On 16 July 1995, then President, Jacques Chirac, stated that it was time that France faced up to its past and he acknowledged the role that the state had played in the persecution of Jews and other victims of the German occupation. Those responsible for the round-up, according to Chirac, were \\"\\" (\\"450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis\\"). To mark the 70th anniversary of the round-up, then President Fran√ßois Hollande gave a speech at a monument of the Vel' d'Hiv' round-up on 22 July 2012. The president recognized that this event was a crime committed \\"in France, by France,\\" and emphasized that the deportations in which French police participated were offences committed against French values, principles, and ideals. He continued his speech by remarking that the Republic would clamp down on anti-Semitism \\"with the greatest determination\\". The first official admission that the French State had been complicit in the deportation of 76,000 Jews during WW II was made in 1995 by then President Jacques Chirac, at the site of the V√©lodrome d'Hiver where 13,000 Jews had been rounded up for deportation to death camps in July 1942. \\",\\" he said (\\"France, on that day [16 July 1942], committed the irreparable. Breaking its word, it handed those who were under its protection over to their executioners\\"). \\"\\" (\\"the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state\\").Allocution de M. Jacques CHIRAC Pr√©sident de la R√©publique prononc√©e lors des c√©r√©monies comm√©morant la grande rafle des 16 et 17 juillet 1942 (Paris) , Pr√©sident de la r√©publique On 16 July 2017, also at a ceremony at the Vel' d'Hiv' site, President Emmanuel Macron denounced the historical revisionism that denied France's responsibility for the 1942 round-up and subsequent deportation of 13,000 Jews. \\"It was indeed France that organised this\\", Macron insisted, French police collaborating with the Nazis. ‚ÄúNot a single German‚Äù was directly involved, he said, but French police collaborating with the Nazis. Macron was even more specific than Chirac had been in stating that the Government during the War was certainly that of France. ‚ÄúIt is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it‚Äôs convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie,‚Äù he said. Macron made a subtle reference to Chirac's remark when he added, \\"I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the round-up, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.\\" A plaque marking the Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv' was placed on the track building after the War and moved to 8 boulevard de Grenelle in 1959. On 3 February 1993, President Mitterrand commissioned a monument to be erected on the site.Presidential decree,3 February 1993 It stands now on a curved base, to represent the cycle track, on the edge of the quai de Grenelle. It is the work of the sculptor Walter Spitzer and the architect Mario Azagury. Spitzer and his family were survivors of deportation to Auschwitz. The statues represent all deportees but especially those of the Vel' d'Hiv'. The sculptures include children, a pregnant woman and a sick man. The words on the Mitterrand-era monument still differentiate between the French Republic and the Vichy Government that ruled during WW II, so they do not accept responsibility for the roundup of the Jews. The words are in French: \\"\\", which translate as follows: \\"The French Republic pays homage to the victims of racist and anti-Semitic persecutions and crimes against humanity committed under the de facto authority called the 'Government of the French State' 1940‚Äì1944. Let us never forget.\\" The monument was inaugurated on 17 July 1994. A ceremony is held at the monument every year in July. Popular culture The V√©lodrome d'Hiver is featured in the 2006 novel Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay and in the 2010 film Sarah's Key based on the novel, as well as the French film The Round Up.

It comprises the townlands of Crossconnell, Dunaff, Kinnea, Leenan, Letter, and Urrismenagh. It sits on the eastern side of Loch Swilly and it is bounded to the south-east by the Urris hills, and to the east by Binion hill. To the north, there is Rockstown bay and Tullagh peninsula. There are two entrances to Urris; the Gap of Mamore, and Crossconnell. Urris has some local tourist attractions, such the Dunaff cliffs, Tullagh beach, Rockstown Harbor, Leenan pier and Gap of Mamore. There are a number of traditional thatched cottages in good condition within Urris. History = Mesolithic period = Dunaff bay is the site of Ireland's oldest neolithic campsite. The bay lies at the mouth of Lough Swilly, between the cliffs of Dunaff Head to the north and Leenan Head to the south. The site contained a large number of early Irish Mesolithic artifacts, including unabraded flints comprising a few leaf-shaped flakes, some blade-like flakes and a large amount of waste material. The location is regarded as an \\"industrial site\\" producing material associated with the so-called Early Larnian tradition. = Colonel Daniel McNeill = During the early 18th century, the valley was terrorized by a local landlord who preyed on local young women. Colonel Daniel McNeill was a Scottish Planter, who fought at Battle of the Boyne, and was one of the defenders of Londonderry. Afterwards, he lived in Binion. He maintained a group of Herdsmen, known locally as \\"The Yowmen\\" that terrorized the local population. Any woman he desired, his henchmen brought her to Binion, where she was allegedly raped. If any of his victims became pregnant, he allocated a small portion of land to support the child. These allotments of land become known as \\"McNeills Roods\\". There are many of these allotments of land scattered through Urris and on the road to Clonmany. At the fair at Pollen, he attempted to kidnap a young local woman, but failed when she managed to run into crowd. Later that evening, when he was returning from the fair, he was ambushed and murdered by a group of local men. McNeill was buried in the graveyard of Straid Church. In the mid-19th century, it was still possible to identify his grave, where it was recorded that he died on September 11, 1709, aged 59. = Wolfe Tone = Theobald Wolfe Tone, leader of the 1798 Irish Rebellion, was captured by the Royal Navy off Dunaff Head, Lough Swilly in November 1798. =Poit√≠n production = In the early 19th century, Urris became a center of the illegal poit√≠n distillation industry, and continued to be one of the main economic activities of the area throughout the century. Due to its remote and barren geography, the Urris Hills were an ideal place for poit√≠n-making because the area was surrounded by mountains and only accessible through the Mamore Gap over the Urris Hills and Crossconnell to the East. Derry provided a major market for the trade. In an effort to curtail illegal production, the authorities decided to levy \\"township fines\\" - a collective fine that was placed on an entire community if there was a suspicion that some of its residents were engaged in poit√≠n production. In 1812, to protect their lucrative business, the distillers established a system of scouts that warned of the impending arrival of government officials. People from Urris would take positions above the road on each side of Mamore gap and hurl down rocks, preventing government officials from entering the area. The locals also barricaded the road at Crossconnell to keep out the revenue police and local constabulary. This period of relative independence began the autumn of 1812. In May 1815, the authorities re-established control of the Urris Hills when General Dalziel led a military force into the valley and brought this short period of self-rule to an end. Subsequently, this period was later known as the time of the \\"Poitin Republic of Urris\\". The term \\"Poit√≠n Republic\\" appears to be a 20th century invention, which was first used in the 1920s. There are no available accounts of how the area was governed during this period. Once the authorities had restored revenue collections in the area, the local population were again subjected to frequent raids from the Revenue Police and township fines. These raids were often accompanied by public disturbances. In 1818, the disruption caused by these raids led the local population to petition parliament for relief from the frequent levying of harsh fines. The text of the petition highlighted many of the concerns of the local population: > That the petitioners are compelled to endure the most vexatious and > oppressive exactions under the name of fines for illicit distillation, > imposed upon the aforesaid Parish and townlands contained therein; that many > persons who are guiltless or incapable of illicit distillation, have been > forced to pay large portions of such fines, and that all proofs of > individual innocence are rejected as reasons for exemption from payment of > them; that the severity of diverse persons professing to bear excise > commissions has been so great that alarming disturbances have broken out in > their neighborhood and that the ordinary execution of the laws has failed in > restoring tranquility. Poitin continued to play an important role in the local economy in the pre- famine period. In 1843, the Revenue Police conducted a major raid on an active poitin still owned by Bryan Harkin of Lenan. Harkin, along with four other men, were arrested. Upon hearing of the arrests, a large number of local inhabitants gathered to prevent the arrests. Eventually, Harkin persuaded the crowd to disperse and agreed to accompany the police to Buncrana. Harkin's protection of the police later formed the basis for an appeal after he was convinced of illegal poitin production. = Land reform = The ownership of land was very contentious issue throughout the 19th century. During the 18th century, the primary landlords were the Bishop of Derry and the Marquis of Donegal. In 1810, the townlands of Tullagh, Kinnea, Letter, Dunaff, and Urrismenagh were sold an absentee landlord - Sir Robert Harvey. = Sir Roger Casement = In 1904, the Irish nationalist Sir Roger Casement spent six months learning Gaelic at an Irish Language College in Urris. He lodged in a house in Tiernsligo. He subsequently returned to Inishowen in 1913, where he tried to organize the Irish Volunteers within the Urris Valley. = Second World War = thumb At around 3pm, April 11, 1941, a Vickers Wellington bomber (W5653) crashed into the Urris Hills, resulting in the deaths of its six crew members. The cause of the crash was a navigational error. The plane was returning from a convoy escort patrol to RAF Limavady. The pilot became disorientated in thick fog and mistook Lough Swilly for Lough Foyle, while attempting a visual landing at Limavady. As the plane descended, it crashed into the hills at an elevation of 770 feet. Irish Free State soldiers began an immediate search of the area, which was hampered by thick fog. Due to weather conditions and the difficulty of reaching the crash site, it was not immediately possible to bring to bodies down from the hill. The dead airmen were F/O Alfred Cattley (40888) who piloted the craft; P/O James Montague (81359); Sgt John Bateman (959540); Sgt Francis Whalley (977309); Sgt Frederick Neill (976110); and Sgt Brinley Francis Badman (976192). They were assigned to RAF 221 squadron. In June 1942, a mine washed up in Urris and exploded. There were no reported fatalities or injuries. = Binion Head Fishing Disaster = On August 17, 1962 three fishermen from Rockstown drowned when their lobster boat hit submerged rocks and sank off Binion Head. The three men were Patrick Doherty (aged 40), John McGilloway (aged 50) and his son, also called John McGilloway (aged 24). Patrick Doherty left behind a wife and five children ranging in age from ten to four years.  Places of interest  The view from the Mamore Gap holy well.

During the First World War, the Royal Navy used Lough Swilly as an anchorage for elements of the Grand Fleet and as a staging point for Atlantic convoys. After the Irish War of Independence Lough Swilly and the accompanying forts at Leenan and Dunree were considered to be one of the three Treaty Ports specified in the Anglo-Irish Treaty. These military installations, including Fort Leenan, were handed over to the Irish Free State in 1938. Fort Leenan was closed in 1946. The site is now derelict and contains many dangerous hazards.  Irish language  The Urris area was the last bastion on the Inishowen peninsula where the Irish language was spoken regularly. The Ordnance Map Surveyor - John O'Donovan - visited the area in August 1835. He reported back to the Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey in Dublin that \\"the men only, who go to markets and fairs, speak a little English, the women and children speak Irish only\\". During the early 20th century, Urris had a language school known as the Irish College. The area had a number of native Irish speakers up to the 1940s.  Religion  On the crest of Mamore Gap there are a number of religious sites associated with the Roman Catholic tradition. Saint Columba is believed to have vanquished the water dragon Giollamach in the pass. The area is served by St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church, which was built in 1888.

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners and Arizona Diamondbacks. Rowland-Smith also represented Australia in the World Baseball Classic three times and in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Born in Sydney, Rowland-Smith grew up watching MLB games on videocassette. Signed out of high school by the Seattle Mariners, he spent the next several years pitching for their minor league teams. Promoted to Seattle for the first time in July 2007, he struck out the first batter he faced, former Mariners' star Ken Griffey, Jr.. Rowland-Smith began 2008 as a relief pitcher for the Mariners but was sent to the minor leagues briefly in July to work on becoming a starting pitcher. He rejoined the team in August and remained in their starting rotation the rest of the year. In 2009, he made one start for the Mariners at the beginning of the year before going on the disabled list with triceps tendinitis. Rejoining the team in July, he completed the eighth inning in three of his remaining starts for Seattle. In 2010, he made a career-high 20 starts for the Mariners but posted a 1‚Äì10 record and a 6.75 earned run average (ERA). Seattle allowed him to become a free agent after the year. Over the next three seasons, Rowland-Smith pitched in the minor leagues for several teams. In 2014, he began the season with the Arizona Diamondbacks, much to his excitement as the Diamondbacks were opening the 2014 season in Australia. His time with the Diamondbacks did not last long, as the team designated him for assignment on 18 April. Rowland-Smith pitched for some minor league teams the remainder of the year, then joined the EDA Rhinos of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in 2015. He pitched for the Brisbane Bandits of the Australian Baseball League in January of 2017, then retired after the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Early life Rowland- Smith was born 26 January 1983, in Sydney, Australia. His father is Australian celebrity trainer Rob Rowland-Smith, known as \\"The Sandhill Warrior,\\" and his mother Julie is a retired high school physical education teacher. Ryan was their second child, after his older sister, Rhiannon. Rob and Julie divorced when Ryan was three, and Rowland-Smith grew up with his mother and sister in Newcastle, New South Wales. He was a baseball fan from childhood, though he had to watch games on video cassettes because Major League Baseball was not televised in Australia at the time. The videos he had were of the 1992 World Series and the 1993 World Series. Rowland-Smith started playing baseball himself at the age of 12. He graduated from Newcastle High School in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, in December 2000. The Seattle Mariners, one of the only Major League Baseball (MLB) teams that scouted Australia at the time, signed Rowland-Smith as a non-drafted free agent on 19 November 2000. \\"I signed it before the ink dried,\\" Rowland-Smith said of his contract. \\"It was the only opportunity I was going to get.\\" Career =2001‚Äì04 seasons= Rowland-Smith began his pro career in 2001 with the Rookie level Arizona League Mariners. In 17 relief appearances, he allowed just one home run in innings pitched. He split the 2002 season between the Single-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers and the Single-A short-season Everett AquaSox. With Wisconsin to begin the season, he appeared in 12 games (eight starts), posting a 1‚Äì2 record and a 6.75 earned run average (ERA). In the middle of the season, he was demoted to Everett. He appeared in 18 games (six starts) with Everett, posting a 4‚Äì1 record, a 2.77 ERA, 58 strikeouts, and 58 hits allowed in innings pitched. In 2003, Rowland-Smith pitched for Wisconsin again, appearing in 13 games. He had a 3‚Äì0 record, a 1.11 ERA, and 37 strikeouts in innings. During the year, he also pitched for the Single-A advanced Inland Empire 66ers. In 15 games with the 66ers, he lost one game, posted a 3.20 ERA, struck out 15, and allowed 12 hits over innings pitched. He had a 1.90 ERA and 52 strikeouts combined between Wisconsin and Inland Empire. Rowland-Smith played the entire 2004 season with Inland Empire, appearing in 29 games. He split the season between the bullpen and the starting rotation, going 5‚Äì3 with a 3.79 ERA as a starter. He struck out 119 batters in 99 innings and held opponents to a .276 batting average. =2005 season= The Minnesota Twins selected Rowland-Smith in the Major League portion of the 2004 Rule 5 draft. On 4 March, the Twins signed him to a one-year contract. He spent most of 2005 spring training with the Twins. Ultimately, Minnesota decided not to keep him on the roster all season, and he was returned to Seattle on 25 March. He spent the season with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, setting a career high with 122 innings pitched. In 33 games (17 starts), he had a 6‚Äì7 record, a 4.35 ERA, 102 strikeouts, and 133 hits allowed. =2006 season= Rowland-Smith split the 2006 season with Inland Empire and San Antonio. With the 66ers, he gave up seven runs (four earned) in innings pitched over seven games. He spent a greater portion of the season with the Missions. On 25 August, he struck out a season-high seven batters in innings. In 23 games (one start) for the Missions, he had a 1‚Äì3 record, a 2.83 ERA, 48 strikeouts, and 38 hits allowed in innings. Following the regular season, he played with the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League. =2007 season= For the first time in 2007, Rowland-Smith pitched for the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He made 25 relief appearances for the team, posting a 3‚Äì4 record, a 3.67 ERA, 50 strikeouts, and 35 hits allowed in innings before getting promoted to the Mariners in June. Rowland-Smith made his major league debut for the Mariners on 22 June, against the Cincinnati Reds in a game notable for being the return of longtime Mariners star Ken Griffey, Jr., to Safeco Field. Griffey wound up being the first batter Rowland-Smith faced; he struck him out, proceeding to pitch 1 scoreless innings in a 16‚Äì1 Mariners loss. He did not allow a run in consecutive innings spanning five games from 22 to 31 August. In the first game of that stretch, he struck out six batters in four scoreless innings of relief in an 8‚Äì4 loss to the Twins. He earned his first career win 13 September against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, pitching scoreless innings in a game the Mariners trailed 7‚Äì1 but rallied to win 8‚Äì7. In his rookie year with Seattle, he struck out 42 batters in 38 innings, posting a 1‚Äì0 record and limiting opposing batters to 39 hits. After the season, he pitched for Lara in the Venezuelan Winter League. Rowland-Smith said about his offseason: =2008 season= Rowland-Smith pitching against the Oakland Athletics. Rowland-Smith began the season exclusively as a reliever, making 32 relief appearances before making two starts prior to the All-Star break. He collected his first save April 8 against the Tampa Bay Rays in Seattle's 6‚Äì5 win, tossing innings and retiring all five batters he faced while protecting one-run lead. His first Major League start came 1 July against the Toronto Blue Jays; Rowland-Smith threw three scoreless innings before getting replaced by Roy Corcoran with two outs in the fourth inning after allowing three runs that inning. The Mariners rallied to win 7‚Äì6. He made three more relief appearances before being optioned to Tacoma on 20 July to be converted to a starting pitcher. He went 2‚Äì0 with a 2.89 ERA in three starts for the Rainiers, holding opponents to a .185 batting average before joining Seattle's rotation on 9 August. From 21 August until the end of the season, he posted a 2.56 ERA. Against the Oakland Athletics on 21 August, he took the loss but held the team to four hits in seven innings, keeping Oakland scoreless except for a solo home run by Emil Brown. He faced Oakland again in his final start of the year on 27 September, allowing three runs in innings this time but picking up the win in a 7‚Äì3 victory. In 47 games (12 starts) with the Mariners in 2008, he had a 5‚Äì3 record, a 3.42 ERA, 77 strikeouts, and 114 hits allowed in innings. =2009 season= In a 2009 spring training game against the Colorado Rockies, Rowland-Smith recorded two singles in two at bats. This was his first time batting against a live pitcher since he was 17 years old. He used teammate Jeff Clement's bat. At the beginning of the season, he started one game before being placed on the disabled list with triceps tendinitis. He was sent to Tacoma for rehab starts, but a dismal outing on 5 June in which he allowed 12 runs in innings prompted the Mariners to option him to Tacoma. In July, he was promoted and added to the starting rotation after going 5‚Äì3 with a 4.31 ERA in 10 starts for Tacoma. He lasted seven innings in his first start back on 24 July, allowing four runs and taking the loss in a 9‚Äì0 defeat to the Cleveland Indians. Five days later, he limited the Toronto Blue Jays to two runs over seven innings and picked up his first win of the year in the Mariners' 3‚Äì2 victory. Three times in 2009, he threw a season-high eight innings, including a game on 16 September when he limited the Chicago White Sox to one run in a 4‚Äì1 victory. Rowland-Smith made his last start of the year for the Mariners on 3 October, holding the Texas Rangers to one run over innings in a 2‚Äì1 victory. Rowland-Smith finished the season with a 5‚Äì4 record, a 3.74 ERA, 52 strikeouts, and 87 hits allowed in innings over 15 games (all starts). =2010 season= Rowland-Smith's game against the White Sox on 16 September 2009, left Christian Caple of MLB.com excited about his chances for next season: In fact, Rowland-Smith started the 2010 season as the third starter in the Mariners' rotation, behind Felix Hernandez and Ian Snell. He struggled to begin the season, posting a 7.62 ERA in his first eight starts while losing all four of his decisions. After the shortest start of his career on 18 May, in which he gave up seven runs in innings, the Mariners moved him to the bullpen. Rowland-Smith returned to the rotation on 5 June, when Doug Fister had to miss a start because of shoulder fatigue. The Mariners lost to the Angels 11‚Äì2, but Rowland-Smith limited Los Angeles to one run in five innings. After that, he continued to be used as a starter. He held the Cincinnati Reds scoreless for six innings on 20 June, earning his first win of the year in a 1‚Äì0 victory. The win, however, would be his only victory of the year. On 27 July, he gave up 11 runs over five innings in an 11‚Äì0 loss to the White Sox. The Mariners left him in the game that long because they wanted to preserve their bullpen. After the game, he was placed on the disabled list with a lower back strain, which Rob Neyer of ESPN speculated was a \\"phantom injury\\" designed to get him off the roster, since the Mariners could not send him to the minor leagues without exposing him to waivers. Sent to rehab in Tacoma, he rejoined the team in September when rosters expanded. Upon his activation from the disabled list, Rowland-Smith was mainly used out of the bullpen except for the last game of the season, 3 October, in which he gave up two runs in five innings and had a no-decision in a 4‚Äì3 loss to the Athletics. 20 of Rowland-Smith's 27 appearances in 2010 were starts (a career-high), but only one of those was a win, as opposed to ten losses. He had a 6.75 ERA and gave up 141 hits in innings. However, Rowland- Smith was the Mariners' nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to the MLB player who \\"best represents the game through extraordinary character, community involvement, philanthropy and positive contributions, both on and off the field.\\" Seattle made him their candidate because of his work in hosting the Mariners Care Cystic Fibrosis Foundation golf tournament. In November 2010, the Sydney Blue Sox named Rowland-Smith as one of the players on their 35-man roster for the inaugural Australian Baseball League season, but he never pitched for them. On 2 December 2010, the Mariners decided not to offer him a new contract, making him a free agent. =2011‚Äì2013 seasons= On 9 December 2010, the Houston Astros signed Rowland-Smith to a one-year contract. He spent most of the season with the PCL's Oklahoma City RedHawks. In 22 games (19 starts), he had a 2‚Äì10 record, a 6.19 ERA, 87 strikeouts, and 131 hits allowed in innings. After the season, he became a free agent. During the offseason, he played winter ball for the Leones de Ponce of the Puerto Rican Winter League, losing three of his five starts. The Chicago Cubs signed Rowland-Smith to a minor league deal on 2 February 2012. He spent the whole season with the Iowa Cubs of the PCL, where he was used more as a reliever (22 games) than a starter (eight games). He had a 3‚Äì6 record, a 3.94 ERA, 62 strikeouts, and 75 hits allowed in innings pitched. After the season, he became a free agent. On 24 February 2013, the Boston Red Sox signed Rowland-Smith to a minor league deal. In 37 games in relief for the Pawtucket Red Sox, their Triple-A team, he had a 7‚Äì0 record and a 1.55 ERA. However, he never got to pitch for Boston because of an illness. =2014 season= Rowland-Smith signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks prior to the 2014 season. He was excited about joining Arizona because they were opening their season with two regular-season games in March against the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia. While he did not pitch in the Australian series, Rowland-Smith was on the Diamondbacks roster at the beginning of the 2014 season, his first time on a major league roster since 2010 with the Mariners. He made what would be his last appearance in the major leagues on 14 April, giving up two runs (one earned) in the final two innings of a 7‚Äì3 loss to the New York Mets. Designated for assignment on 18 April, he cleared waivers and elected to become a free agent on 21 April. In six games with the Diamondbacks, he posted a 4.91 ERA, allowing five runs (four earned) in innings of work. On 25 April, Rowland-Smith signed a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. He pitched for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons of the International League, allowing 8 runs in just 14 innings before drawing his release on 11 June. On 28 June, he signed a minor league deal with the Cincinnati Reds. He made one start for the Louisville Bats of the International League but was mostly used out of the bullpen, posting a 4.20 ERA in 12 games with no wins or losses. On 2 August, the Reds released him. =Last years= For 2015, Rowland-Smith left the United States, signing with the EDA Rhinos of the Chinese Professional Baseball League, located in Taiwan. He appeared in nine games with the team, posting a 1‚Äì4 record and a 4.70 ERA in 46 innings. For winter 2015‚Äì16, Rowland-Smith pitched in one game for Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Winter League. After not pitching in 2016, Rowland-Smith signed with the Brisbane Bandits of the Australian Baseball League in January 2017. In four starts with the team, he won one game but had a 6.35 ERA. However, he was part of a Brisbane club which won its second consecutive ABLchampionship. Rowland- Smith planned to retire after the season once he had finished playing for Australia in the World Baseball Classic. International play Rowland-Smith represented his native Australia in multiple international tournaments throughout his career. He played for Australia in the 2004 Summer Olympic games, making four relief appearances, going 2‚Äì0 with a 1.23 ERA allowing only six hits and five walks while striking out 5. He helped the team to a silver medal. They made it to the championship game before falling to Cuba, 6‚Äì2. Rowland-Smith's teammates on the Inland Empire 66ers paid close attention to the gold medal game, cheering on their teammate. At the start of the 2006 season, Rowland-Smith was added to the Australia national baseball team for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. However, he was unable to pitch in the Classic because of a sore elbow. Rowland-Smith once again represented Australia in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The team was eliminated after losing all three of its games in the first round. Before he retired, Rowland- Smith represented Australia one last time at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. First, he pitched with the team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic ‚Äì Qualifier 1 from 11 to 14 February 2016. In Australia's second game of the qualifier (the first against South Africa), Rowland-Smith pitched three scoreless innings in relief of Warwick Saupold, allowing two hits and striking out three. Australia defeated the Philippines and South Africa twice to advance in the tournament. \\"On paper, as far as rosters go, we have the best roster, we have the most depth,\\" he said of the team during the qualifier. It was Australia's fourth-straight World Baseball Classic qualified for, but they failed to advance past the first round, going 1‚Äì2 with a win over China and losses to Japan and Cuba. Post-playing career Rowland-Smith became a baseball television analyst for Root Sports Northwest, appearing on the pre- and post-game shows for Seattle Mariners broadcasts starting in 2017. He is also a baseball radio analyst for ESPN710 Seattle, appearing on Mariners post- game shows. Rowland-Smith said that baseball and talking were the two things he enjoyed doing the most; thus, being a commentator was the perfect occupation for him. He and fellow Australian ballplayer Trent Oeltjen co- founded NxtGen Baseball, a training camp for young baseball players. Personal life Rowland-Smith's grandfather was a former New South Wales minister for sport and recreation. His older sister, Rhiannon, is a competitive surfer. While surfing is not his profession, Rowland-Smith avidly pursues it as a hobby. Rowland-Smith was married in 2013 to American actress Amanda Aardsma, the sister of his former teammate David Aardsma. He became friends with Griffey, Jr., victim of his first major league strikeout, who attended Rowland-Smith's wedding in 2013. Rowland-Smith is the first player with a hyphenated last name ever to appear in a major league game. During his career, he maintained his own blog to keep up with fans. He was also, in 2009, the only Mariner known to maintain a Twitter account. Rowland-Smith helped the Mariners host a forum on the use of social media in 2009. In June 2019, Rowland-Smith appeared on the television show American Ninja Warrior in the Seattle Qualifying Round. He said of the opportunity, \\"I know the minute I step out to the steps, if I don‚Äôt finish it, I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄòOK, I want another shot at this until I do finish it.‚Äô But at the very least, I want to enjoy it and embrace it. I‚Äôve gotten messages from people in that ninja community and it‚Äôs so awesome. ‚Ä¶ I want to get the most of that experience.\\" References External links , or CPBL, or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League), or Ryan Rowland-Smith's Blog Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:American Ninja Warrior contestants Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players Category:Arizona League Mariners players Category:Australian expatriate baseball players in Taiwan Category:Australian expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Baseball coaches Category:Baseball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Brisbane Bandits players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:EDA Rhinos players Category:Estrellas Orientales players Category:Everett AquaSox players Category:Gigantes del Cibao players Category:Gulf Coast Astros players Category:Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino players Category:Iowa Cubs players Category:Leones de Ponce players Category:Louisville Bats players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Australia Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Oklahoma City RedHawks players Category:Olympic medalists in baseball Category:Olympic baseball players of Australia Category:Olympic silver medalists for Australia Category:Pawtucket Red Sox players Category:Peoria Javelinas players Category:San Antonio Missions players Category:Seattle Mariners broadcasters Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Sportspeople from Sydney Category:Tacoma Rainiers players Category:Wisconsin Timber Rattlers players Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players Category:2013 World Baseball Classic players Category:2017 World Baseball Classic players ","title":"Ryan Rowland-Smith"},{"id":"7958048","text":"Bottom line or the bottom line may refer to: * BLUF (communication), an abbreviation for \\"bottom line up front\\" * Bottom line mentality * Bottom Line Publications, a branch of Boardroom, Inc., publishers of certain newsletters * Double bottom line, a business term used in socially responsible enterprise and investment * ESPN BottomLine, the trademark for a lower-third sports information ticker graphic * In horse breeding, the \\"tail-female\\" line of descent (traced only through females), reflecting that line's position at the bottom of tabulated pedigrees * The Bottom Line (radio programme), a business discussion program on BBC Radio 4 * The Bottom Line (Australian TV series), an Australian leadership discussion television program on Channel Nine * The Bottom Line (Bryant University), a collegiate a cappella group at Bryant University * The Bottom Line (venue), a performance venue in New York City's Greenwich Village from 1974 to 2004 * The Bottom Line (media), a Slovenian online investigative media website *The Bottom Line (US Politics TV programme), US politics discussion program by Al Jazeera English * The bottom line, or net income, the income that a firm has after subtracting costs and expenses from the total revenue * The Bottomline with Boy Abunda, a talk show program in the Philippines on ABS-CBN * The catchphrase of wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin ** WWE Bottom Line, a World Wrestling Entertainment syndicated television show whose name came from the aforementioned catchphrase * Triple bottom line, a business term used in measuring organizational (and societal) success: economic, environmental and social * Bottom Line (album), a 1979 album by John Mayall  Songs  * \\"Bottom Line\\", by Diana Ross from her 1989 album Workin' Overtime * \\"Bottom Line\\", by Martin Solveig from his 2008 album C'est La Vie * \\"Bottom Line\\", by Ratt from their 1988 album Reach for the Sky * \\"Bottom Line\\", by Raven from their 1985 album Stay Hard * \\"Bottom Line\\", by Swollen Members from their 2003 album Heavy * \\"Bottom Line\\", by the 77s from their 1987 album The 77s * \\"Land of the Bottom Line\\", by John Gorka from his 1990 album Land of the Bottom Line * \\"The Bottom Line\\", by Alanis Morissette, a demo for 1995's Jagged Little Pill * \\"The Bottom Line\\" (Big Audio Dynamite song) from their 1985 debut This Is Big Audio Dynamite * \\"The Bottom Line\\", by David Lee Roth from his 1988 album Skyscraper * \\"The Bottom Line\\", by Depeche Mode from their 1997 album Ultra ","title":"Bottom line (disambiguation)"},{"id":"7958056","text":"Dayton High School may refer to: *Dayton High School (Kentucky), Dayton, Kentucky *Dayton High School (Nevada), Dayton, Nevada *Dayton High School (Oregon), Dayton, Oregon *Dayton High School (Texas), Dayton, Texas *Dayton High School (Washington), Dayton, Washington ","title":"Dayton High School"},{"id":"7958057","text":"B√©k√©s county in Hungary Zsad√°ny is a village in B√©k√©s county, in the Southern Great Plain region of south-east Hungary.

Procedure Badla trading involved buying stocks with borrowed money with the stock exchange acting as an intermediary at an interest rate determined by the demand for the underlying stock and a maturity not greater than 70 days. Like a traditional futures contract, badla is a form of leverage; unlike futures, the broker‚Äînot the buyer or seller‚Äîis responsible for the maintenance of the marked-to-market margin.B. Venkatesh. 2001. \\"Badla versus futures.\\" The Hindu Business Line. =Example= The mechanism of badla finance can be explained with the following example: Suppose A wants to buy shares of a company but does not have enough money now. If A values the shares more than their current price, A can do a badla transaction. Suppose there is a badla financier B who has enough money to purchase the shares, so on A's request, B purchases the shares and gives the money to his broker. The broker gives the money to exchange and the shares are transferred to B. But the exchange keeps the shares with itself on behalf of B. Now, say one month later, when A has enough money, he gives this money to B and takes the shares. The money that A gives to B is slightly higher than the total value of the shares. This difference between the two values is the interest as badla finance is treated as a loan from B to A. The rate of interest is decided by the exchange and it changes from time to time.

The area has many prehistoric tumuli, known locally as kunhalom ('Cumanian Barrow'). The largest is G√∂d√©ny-halom with a height of over 12 metres. History After the Hungarian conquest nearly seventy settlements were founded in the region of the K√∂r√∂s rivers. Archaeological research indicates there were a number of smaller settlements in this region which later were depopulated during the Mongol invasion. The first written reference about B√©k√©sszentandr√°s ‚Äì as we now know is from 1297. The name of the village was mentioned for the first time in a controversial issue in 1329. Its autonomy was recognised on 18 April 1330 and became the property of the √özv√°s√°ri family under the name of Zenthandreas. Almost a hundred years later the settlement became the Crown's property again. Around 1436 King Sigismund donated it to his Knight J√°nos Hunyadi. The construction and flourishing of the Szentandr√°si estate began in that period. Around 1460 the estate received market town rights. After the death of J√°nos Hunyadi, his wife Erzs√©bet Szil√°gyi managed the estate. She was followed by J√°nos Corvin and Andr√°s D√°nfy. Under the leadership of the D√°nfy family the estate fell into pieces, lost its integrated management and market town rights. The four parts of the village were shared by Mikl√≥s Nagyfalusi Toldy, Anna D√°nfy, the Paksy and Pat√≥csi family. The number of people living in Szentandr√°s under the Turkish rule often changed. Many of them left the settlement during the fighting at Gyula and just slowly drifted back to their village. Due to the high tax burden many people fled to the free counties. In 1596 Tatars destroyed the village, after that the territory was fallow for a long time. In the mid-1600s the area became populated again under the jurisdiction of Gy√∂rgy R√°k√≥czi who was the Prince of Transylvania. In the 1690s it became deserted once again because of liberation wars and a plague outbreak. In the early 1700s a magistrate, Gy√∂rgy Sz√°raz received the territory for 32,000 Forints. His wife, Katalin Dor√≥czi was a descendant of the Paksy family. The first settlers arrived in 1719 from Kaba, Bihar county and later others came after them. Among them were a number of resettled people. Gy√∂rgy Sz√°raz leased the estate to the county treasurer Istv√°n Tolna, who was very cruel to the residents. They rebelled and this sparked the biggest rebellion of the century on 27 April 1735. Its leaders were P√©r√≥ Szegedin√°cz, and the judge of Szentandr√°s, Mih√°ly V√©rtessi. In the 1740s, the population of the village continued to grow after new groups arrived: Catholics from the upper Tisza and Lutheran Slovaks from Hont and N√≥gr√°d counties. The latter, for the landlord's proposal migrated to Koml√≥s mere. In 1796 a part of the inhabitants moved to Kishegyes mere. The 19th century population of Szentandr√°s increased steadily. In 1827 3,740, in 1852 4,941, in 1890 6,362 inhabitants lived here. The village took part in the 1848-49 Independence War and several people became a victim. The most important event of that century was the river regulation so life became safer. The village was named B√©k√©sszentandr√°s at the end of the 1800s. Both World Wars had many casualties in the village, a Heroes' Statue reminds them which was inaugurated by J√≥zsef Archduke in 1927. One of the important results of the inter-war period is the introduction of carpet making which made B√©k√©sszentandr√°s world-famous. The others are the modernisation of the local administration and the secession of Csabacs√ºd in 1924. Between 1936 and 1942 the country's largest dam of that time was built on the H√°rmas-K√∂r√∂s River. The dam was put into operation by the Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy. In the post-war period collectivisation played a key role in the village. Beside agriculture, carpenters, shoemakers, metalworkers and tailors formed a cooperative, too. In the early 1960s a municipal water network was built up and pavement construction was started in the village so the living conditions improved. From the late 60's agriculture is the main source of income in the area. In 1970 B√©k√©sszentandr√°s got the so-called incorporated town title. Since 1990 the village has been supplied with public utilities like the sewerage-, gas pipeline-, IT network and drainage ditch system. Most of the roads are fitted with solid surface. After the realisation of the future plans there's a realistic chance to establish a small town from the village.

She was one of California's first female pilots and the first woman to fly an airplane from LAX. Hilder was a member of a flying aerial team called The Flying Sylvesters. Biography Born to Swedish parents Andrew G. Youngberg (1853-1935) and Frida A. Flard (1853-1963) on August 10, 1890 as Hilder Florentina Youngberg. She married James Floyd Smith on May 11, 1907. Together they barnstormed thru southern California for five years with the Flying Sylvesters. In the summer of 1912, Hilder and Frank Shaw helped Floyd built his own airplane, Floyd added dual controls to fly with Hilder. They had two sons Sylvester Smith (1908-1919) and Prevost Vedrines Smith (1913‚Äì1991) aka Prevost Floyd Smith. In 1919 at age 11, Sylvester was tragically killed by a car in Chicago. Glenn L. Martin needed a female parachutist to jump into the opening ceremonies of the new Los Angeles Harbor. Hilder had never jumped before but made a deal to jump twice if she could use Martin's airplanes with flight lessons from her husband.In April 1914 she made two parachute jumps using a static line chute. On her second jump climbing from a Glenn Martin piloted airplane correcting for drift on a windy April 1914 day, Hilder, a non-swimmer, was startled by seeing the Los Angeles bay below. Reaching for the cockpit rail, she slipped tumbling from the airplane twisting the parachute lines. Quickly untangling the chute lines, Hilder inflated her chute just in time, landing on the beach. Watching the near disaster, her spouse Floyd Smith vowed to redesign the Broadwick static line parachute to safely operate away from the airplane. Hilder's inspiration spured Floyd to develop and patient the first freefall or modern parachute. On June 10, 1914, with flight instruction from her spouse, Hilder Smith made her first solo flight in Martin's airplane. In 1916, with passenger Adele Mosteri, she became the first female pilot to fly out of Bennett's bean field, which became LAX. Hilder Florentina Smith died on January 11, 1977 in La Mesa, San Diego, California. She is buried at the Portal of Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation in California.

He is chiefly known today for his work to free slaves. On the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, Knibb was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit. He was the first white male to receive the country's highest civil honour. Knibb's elder brother Thomas was a missionary-schoolmaster in Jamaica. When Thomas died at 24,Thomas was born on 11 October 1799. Hinton incorrectly gives 1823 as his death year though later quotes a letter dated 18 April 1825 written by William saying Thomas had preached there exactly a year ago on Sabbath evening. The gravestone confirms 1824. ACJ. William volunteered to replace him. A dedication service was held in Bristol on 7 October 1824, two days after he had married Mary Watkins (or Watkis). The newly-weds sailed to Jamaica on 5 November 1824. William was aged just 21.Kettering Borough Council, 2005: William Knibb, Missionary and Emancipator. Available from KBC. Knibb found six English Baptist missionaries, African-Caribbean Baptist deacons, and thriving congregations already in Jamaica when he arrived. Together they were following the pioneering work of the African preacher George Lisle, a former slave from Virginia who had arrived in 1782 and founded a Baptist church in Kingston. Knibb began work as the schoolmaster of the Baptist mission school in Kingston and worked closely with fellow missionaries Thomas Burchell and James Phillippo, who formed a trio. In 1828 he moved to Savanna-la-Mar. In 1830 he became the minister responsible for the Baptist church at Falmouth, which had regular congregations of 600 when he arrived. He remained there as minister until he died. Portrait and signature of William Knibb, 1845 Attitude to slavery The Baptists in Jamaica were founded by freed slaves, notably George Lisle, who sought support and finance for schools and chapels from nonconformists abroad, particularly from the English Baptist movement, which William Knibb contributed to. Jamaica had become a major sugar exporter, relying on slavery. Knibb sided with the slaves and the cause of emancipation. Knibb made his feelings clear. When Sam Swiney, a black slave, was unjustly accused of a minor offence, Knibb spoke for him in court. In a gross miscarriage of justice, the colonial authorities convicted Swiney and had him flogged. But Knibb refused to let the matter drop, and published details in an island newspaper, for which he was threatened with a prosecution for libel. His account reached the Secretary of State in London, who eventually dismissed from office the two responsible magistrates. Knibb and his Baptist colleagues were instrumental in opposing the repeated attempts by the House of Assembly to enact draconian legislation in Jamaica during the 1820s, the Consolidated Slave Law, and in persuading the British parliament to disallow it. Not surprisingly, Knibb was highly popular with the slaves. Not long afterwards the church in Falmouth needed a minister and Knibb's name was put forward. The missionary who chaired the meeting recorded that when he proposed Knibb should be their new minister and asked for a show of hands, the entire membership stood up, held up both hands, and wept. Violence At this time pressure was growing in Britain for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. The colonial authorities exerted all their political power to halt this movement, while the slaves' excitement and anticipation grew. Eventually this unstable mix resulted in the Great Jamaican Slave Revolt, led by Samuel Sharpe. The colonialists put down the revolt with great violence, treating the missionaries with great suspicion. Knibb himself was placed under armed guard and only obtained bail through the intervention of two prominent colonialists. In the mayhem Bridges, an Anglican clergyman, formed an association of colonialists to oppose the anti-slavery movement by all necessary means. This 'Colonial Church Union' used the cover of martial law to carry out terrorist acts. White settlers burned down a dozen Baptist chapels, including Knibb's at Falmouth. They forced many missionaries to leave Jamaica, but not Knibb. The planters plotted to murder him, but the plot became known and Knibb's family found refuge with one of the leading islanders. After his release, for three successive nights a group of 50 white planters stoned his lodging. Jamaica's advocate In 1832 the Baptist slaves of Jamaica decided to send Knibb back to England to plead their cause. Once home he toured England and Scotland, speaking at public meetings. He told the truth about the good work being done by the nonconformist churches in Jamaica, and about the colonial oppression of the slaves. Knibb himself later recalled his efforts. Knibb was summoned to appear before committees of both Houses of Parliament that had been convened to investigate the state of the West Indian colonies. Abolition At last in May 1833 a Bill for the Abolition of Slavery in the Colonies was introduced. This was enacted later that year. The date for the termination of slavery was 1 August 1834, but slaves had to endure a further six-year 'apprenticeship' before they were granted full freedom. The planters ruthlessly abused this provision. A new law was passed by the Jamaican House of Assembly to thwart the intention behind the Act. This Jamaican legislation prevented emancipation by compelling former slaves to work in an apprenticeship scheme under which the proceeds of their work were to be used to buy out inflated apprenticeship values of ¬£60, ¬£80, or ¬£90 or higher, as set by their former owners. Knibb and others opposed these abuses, so that Parliament brought forward the date for full emancipation from 1840 to 1838. Education and social care With emancipation came great social changes. At a stroke thousands of slave children also became free, for whom there was no education provided. Knibb did what he could, but was hampered by a lack of teachers. Upon emancipation, the adult slaves were released into a world without any education or institutions to support them. The church ministers were often the only people to whom the freed slaves could go for legal advice. Knibb remarked that \\"Often I have had persons come to me for advice who have walked twenty miles to ask for it.\\" Knibb helped to raise money to purchase thousands of acres of land, to enable 19,000 former slaves to own their own property. Religious revival With emancipation also came great religious changes. During 1838-45 came the religious revival known as the Jamaican Awakening. Many thousands of former slaves joined the nonconformist churches. Knibb recalled that \\"in those seven years, through the labour of about twenty [Baptist] missionaries, 22,000 people were baptised upon their profession of faith in Jesus Christ\\". Knibb personally baptised 6,000 converts, and translated the Bible into Creole, the native language of the slaves. In 1839 the Birmingham Anti-Slavery Society became the Birmingham Branch of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. This society was planning a major convention in 1840 with Joseph Sturge taking the lead. Knibb as invited. Thomas Swan, who led Birmingham's Cannon Street Baptist chapel, was able to meet Knibb who he and Joseph Sturge had worked hard to support. Knibb had already encouraged his congregation in Jamaica to take unilateral action and free any of their unpaid staff. Knibb had brought with him to England two deacons from Jamaica named Edward Barrett and Henry Beckford. These two men spoke to 5,000 people at Birmingham Town Hall and Beckford became the central figure in Haydon's painting that commemorated the World Anti-Slavery Convention. By 1845, the Baptists in Jamaica had built 47 new chapels to replace those burned down by the Colonial Church Union. Many of the churches, almost entirely made up of former slaves, were financially independent. Knibb's own church at Falmouth had grown over the previous ten years from 650 to 1,280 members. Over 3,000 adults had been baptised, two thirds of whom had been sent out to form new churches. Six daughter churches were planted by the Falmouth church alone. Knibb was personally associated with the founding of 35 churches, 24 missions, and 16 schools. Death Blue plaque at Knibb's birthplace in Market Street, Kettering, England Knibb died of fever in Jamaica on 15 November 1845, aged 42, and was buried at his Baptist Falmouth Chapel, the service attracting eight thousand African islanders. His funeral sermon by pastor Samuel Oughton was taken from Zechariah, xi, 2 \\"Howl, fir tree, for the mighty cedar is fallen\\". In 1988, the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, Knibb was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit; the first white man to receive the country's highest civil honour.

This defeats spam programs that only connect to the highest priority (lowest numbered) MX and do not follow the standard error-handling of retrying the next priority MX. Drawbacks * The technique relies on spammers using simple software that doesn't retry the next priority MX, and so becomes ineffective if or when spammers begin using more sophisticated software. * Some legitimate SMTP applications are also very simple and only send to the lowest numbered MX record. This might be the case with simple devices such as printers or data loggers, or with older legacy software. Mail from them will also fail unless there is some mechanism to allow a \\"whitelist\\" of IPs access to the mailserver via the lowest numbered MX record. * It is important that the highest priority (lowest numbered) MX should be completely unresponsive on port 25. If it is open and responds with a 4xx error, (i.e. \\"retry later\\"), then email from some MTAs (such as qmail), may be lost if they do not step to the next MX record, but instead wait and continually retry the first one.\\"Other tricks\\", Apache SpamAssassin Similar techniques There are alternate techniques that suggest \\"sandwiching\\" the valid MX records between non-responsive ones. Some variants also suggest configuring the highest-numbered hosts to always return 4xx errors (i.e. \\"retry later\\"). A simple example of MX records that demonstrate the technique: MX 10 dummy1.example.com. MX 20 real-primary-mail-server.example.com. MX 30 dummy2.example.com. Greylisting also relies on the fact that spammers often use custom software which will not persevere to deliver a message in the correct RFC-compliant way.

The species was formerly classified as Salsola sativa. Engraving published 1813 (Adolphus Ypey). Barilla refers to several species of salt-tolerant (halophyte) plants that, until the 19th Century, were the primary source of soda ash and hence of sodium carbonate. The word \\"barilla\\" was also used directly to refer to the soda ash obtained from plant sources. Definitions of \\"barilla\\" in The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1989). Definitions retrieved from the online edition on December 3, 2006. The word is an anglicization of the Spanish word barrilla for saltwort plants (a particular category of halophytes). A very early reference indicating the value placed upon soda ash in Catalonia has been given by Glick, who notes that \\"In 1189 the monastery of Poblet granted to the glassblower Guillem the right to gather glasswort in return for tithe and two hundred pounds of sheet glass paid annually (The site of these glassworks, at Narola, was excavated in 1935.).\\"Glick, Thomas F. (1979). Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages: Comparative Perspectives on Social and Cultural Formation (Princeton University Press, Princeton), ch. 7. Archived at WebCite from this original URL on 2008-03-01. By the 18th Century, Spain's barilla industry was exporting large quantities of soda ash of exceptional purity; the product was refined from the ashes of barilla plants that were specifically cultivated for this purpose. Presumably the word \\"barilla\\" entered English and other languages as a consequence of this export trade. The main Spanish barilla species included (i) Salsola soda (the common English term barilla plant for Salsola soda reflects this usage), (ii) Salsola kali, and (iii) Halogeton sativus (formerly Salsola sativa). \\"Barilla ,\\" definition in The American Heritage Dictionary, Fourth Edition, (2000). Definition retrieved from the online edition on November 16, 2006. P√©rez, Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez (1998). \\"From the barrilla to the Solvay factory in Torrelavega: The Manufacture of Saltwort in Spain,\\" Antilia: The Spanish Journal of History of Natural Sciences and Technology, Vol. IV, Art. 1. . Archived at WebCite from this original URL on 2008-03-01.Pereira, Jonathan (1842). Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira described the main species used to make barilla in different places. Thus \\"Canary barilla is procured from Salsola Kali,\\" \\"Alicant barilla is obtained from Salsola sativa, Chenopodium setigerum, and other species,\\" and \\"Of the French barillas, two only deserve notice; namely, that of Narbonne, obtained from Salicornia herbacea, and which yields 14-15%, ...\\" Online version at books.google.com. Fairly recently, P√©rez has concluded that the most prominent species was likely Halogeton sativus; earlier authors have tended to favor Salsola soda. The word \\"barilla\\" was also used directly to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the saltworts grown in Spain, but also glassworts, mangroves, and seaweed.Bird, Juliet F. (1978). \\"The Nineteenth-Century Soap Industry and its Exploitation of Intertidal Vegetation in Eastern Australia ,\\" The Australian Geographer, Vol. 14, pp. 38-41. These types of plant-derived soda ash are impure alkali substances that contain widely varying amounts of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), some additional potassium carbonate (also an alkali), and a predominance of non-alkali impurities. Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). Chemical Revolution, (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65-90\\\\. . The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is \\"lixiviated\\" (extracted with water) from the ashes of the burned, dried plants. The resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished barilla. A very similar process is used to obtain potash (mainly potassium carbonate) from the ashes of hardwood trees. The best Spanish barilla‚Äîprepared by master barrilleros‚Äîcontained about 30% Na2CO3. In 1877 Kingzett described the importance of the barilla trade to Spain as follows: \\"So highly was the product valued, and the importance of the trade regarded, that by the laws of Spain the exportation of the seed was an offence punishable by death.\\"Kingzett, Charles Thomas (1877). The History, Products, and Processes of the Alkali Trade, Including the Most Recent Improvements (Longmans, Green, & Co., London), p. 69. Online version retrieved July 22, 2007. Some authors indicate that \\"barilla\\" was a specific plant used for soda ash production; this usage is erroneous, but presumably corresponds to the common usage of \\"barilla plant\\" exclusively for Salsola soda. Perhaps this common usage itself reflects an old error in assuming that a single plant species was used by the Spaniards for their industry. In still earlier times, the sources of soda ash and the methods of processing it were secrets that were zealously guarded. Salsola soda is a plant from which barilla was made  References  External links *Photograph of Halogeton sativus in bloom, from Flores de Almeria website.

Super Deluxe was first launched on January 17, 2007 and featured digital shorts by comedians including Bob Odenkirk, Maria Bamford, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim. The website was folded into Adult Swim.com on May 7, 2008. =Revival= Super Deluxe was relaunched as a new entity in late 2015. The \\"new\\" Super Deluxe was a separate entity from its original incarnation, only connected by name. The network features short form videos including comedic shorts, political satire, animation, and music videos. The Super Deluxe production studio focuses on television series and feature films. Among these videos are Donald Trump related videos by Vic Berger, a frequent collaborator for the comedy duo Tim & Eric. Each of these videos remixes various debate appearances with air horns and crowds chanting Trump's name. During both the 2016 Republican National Convention and the 2016 Democratic National Convention, both Vic Berger and Tim Heidecker covered the events on the Super Deluxe channel. Vic Berger also created an \\"Oscar bait\\" version of the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton for Super Deluxe. In 2017, Vicente Fox, the former President of Mexico, appeared in a series of videos on the channel. In these videos, Fox criticized Trump on a variety of issues including his proposal to build a wall between America and Mexico and his Cinco de Mayo taco bowl tweet. In September 2018, it was announced that Super Deluxe, alongside Blink Industries and Conaco, will be producing new episodes of the British web series, Don't Hug Me I'm Scared.

His detainee ID number is 131. Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts reports that Hadi was born on January 15, 1976, in Hadramaut, Yemen. He was transferred to Saudi Arabia on January 5, 2017. The transfer of Hadi, and more than a dozen other men, in the closing days of the Barack Obama Presidency was seen as marking a key disagreement between Obama and President- elect Donald Trump, who favored expanding the camp. Inconsistent identification Salem was named inconsistently on the official lists: * He was named Salem Ahmed Ben Kend on the list of names released on April 20, 2006. list of prisoners (.pdf), US Department of Defense, April 20, 2006 * He was named Salem Ahmed Hadi on the list of names released on May 15, 2006. * He was named Salim Ahmed Haddi Hathramoot on his 2008 Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment. Official status reviews Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, lead by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.\\" * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.\\" * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.\\" * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives whose \\"names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.\\" * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges that the following detainees were captured under circumstances that strongly suggest belligerency.\\" * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives who was a foreign fighter. * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of \\"36 [captives who] openly admit either membership or significant association with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or some other group the government considers militarily hostile to the United States.\\" * Salem Ahmed Ben Kend was listed as one of the captives who had admitted \\"fighting on behalf of Al Qaeda or the Taliban.\\" A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Salem Ahmed Ben Kend's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, on 7 October 2004.

His 9-page Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment was drafted on April 8, 2008. It was signed by camp commandant Rear Admiral Mark H. Buzby. He recommended continued detention. =Joint Review Task Force= On January 20, 2009, newly elected President Barack Obama announced that he would try to empty the Guantanamo Bay Detention camps. He replaced the George W. Bush administration's annual OARDEC reviews, by military officers, reviews by high level officials from several government departments - the Joint Review Task Force, to be followed up by regular reviews by a Periodic Review Board. The Joint Review Task Force's conclusion was that Hadi was too dangerous to release. =Periodic Review Board= A Periodic Review Board concluded, in May 2016, that Hadi could safely be transferred to another country. This was the fifth time his status had been considered by the Board. Transfer to Saudi Arabia Hadi, and three other individuals from Yemen, were transferred to Saudi Arabia on January 5, 2017 - in the closing weeks of Obama's second term. The men were not transferred back to Yemen, their home, because officials judged Yemen too unstable. The Nigerian Vanguard noted that the final push of the Obama Presidency was in conflict with the incoming administration of Donald Trump to retain all the individuals held in Guantanamo, and to fill it up with additional individuals.

Songguk-ri is a settlement and burial site that is important in the study of Korean prehistory. It is registered as Historical Site No. 249. Songguk-ri is a main point of reference in Korean prehistory‚ÄîKorean archaeologists have represented the prehistoric village and the material culture excavated from there as the type-site for Middle Mumun Culture in southern Korea. History of Excavations Artifacts excavated from a stone cist burial at Songguk-ri Excavations began there in 1975 and Songguk-ri was one of the first archaeological sites in South Korea to yield bronze artifacts, large tubular greenstone beads, and pit-houses with rounded plan-shapes. Rounded pit-houses similar with those of Songguk-ri were later found at other archaeological sites along with a suite of other co-occurring artifacts prompting archaeologists to use Songguk-ri as the type site for Middle Mumun culture and label features and artifacts from there and other Middle Mumun sites as 'Songguk-ri Style'. In particular, the term Songguk-ri-style pit-house is the typological name given to Middle Mumun Period dwellings in southern Korea. The site has been excavated a number of times by branches of the National Museum of Korea (Buyeo National Museum 2000; National Museum of Korea 1979, 1986, 1987). The location of Songguk-ri and other Mumun Period settlement sites in the Korean Peninsula that are mentioned in other Wikipedia articles. Layout Groups of pit-houses are found in various spots in an area of almost 100,000 km¬≤. Forty-four pit-houses were excavated at Songguk-ri (O 1997). Pottery that is typically found in the Late Middle Mumun (c. 700‚Äì550 B.C.) was unearthed from the pit-houses, but some pit-houses may date to the Late Mumun. Evidence of an imposing palisade erected around one of the residential precincts at the site has been found, leading archaeologists to hypothesize about conflict and competition in the local Mumun society. A number of smaller settlements from the same time period are found within several kilometres of Songguk-ri. The site also contains a high status stone- cist burial with a Liaoning-style bronze dagger, a number of large tubular- shaped greenstone ornaments, and a finely-made groundstone dagger. A number of jar-burials have been unearthed from the site. Historical significance Songguk-ri was likely part of the central settlement distributed amongst smaller settlements in the Seokseong-cheon River valley that briefly formed a simple chiefdom for approximately one or two generations in the Middle Mumun. Songguk-ri is one of the well-known sites from Korean prehistory that displays some formative examples of characteristics of Protohistoric chiefdoms such as Mahan, Byeonhan, and early states such as Baekje. For example, Songguk-ri contains evidence of several long-term trends in Korean prehistory and protohistory such as the existence of social status distinctions and the use of prestige artifacts such as greenstone and metal (e.g. Liaoning-style bronze dagger) in burials. It is thus that Songguk-ri and other such prehistoric sites of a similar age (e.g. Igeum-dong, Daepyeong, etc.) are referred to when we begin the discussion regarding the origins of social complexity and the formation of states in the Korean peninsula.

It is south-east of the Brisbane CBD. In the Belmont has a population of 4,374 people. Geography While much of the suburb remains as undeveloped blocks of bush mixed with large rural properties, some areas have built-up residential estates. Two of Brisbane's main roads, the Gateway Motorway above and Old Cleveland Road underneath, cross at a large intersection in Belmont. Belmont has become an affluent suburb with large estates sitting on acres of land. Homes can range from around to and over.  History  The local indigenous people hunted and camped within the creeks and hills of Belmont, both before and after white settlement of the area. A corroboree ground existed on banks of Bulimba Creek and mineral springs near Mount Petrie were a popular camping spot for the Aboriginal people. Andrew Petrie had reported that fine timber existed in the area. The Hoop Pine brought timber cutters to the area in the 1850s and by the 1860s and 1870s the cleared land near the creeks and the rich soils from the cleared forests were used to grow sugar cane. As sugar production declined in southern Queensland, farmers moved to growing pineapples, bananas and small crops including tomatoes, potatoes and grapes. Dairies and fodder farms were also located in the area. August Charles Frederick Bernecker gave the name Belmont to his new estate outside of Brisbane and this name spread to the rest of the area. Belmont State School opened on 5 June 1876. The Grassdale Land Company Limited formed on 8 January 1885 to acquire the property known as Grassdale Paddocks, in the parish of Tingalpa, with registered shareholders holding 80 shares of 250 pounds each. This area is spread across the Brisbane suburbs of Belmont, Chandler and Gumdale. The company offered the land for auction in the Grassdale Estate later in 1885. The allotments were situated along Grassdale Road, London Road, Boston Road, Old Cleveland Road, Archer Street and four unnamed roads (later called Belmont Road, Stanborough Road, Tilley Road and New Cleveland Road). Prior to the sale extensive publicity was published in the Brisbane newspapers, calling for \\"the attention of the investor, capitalist, farmer, merchant, artizan [sic], and mechanic, and is only one hour‚Äôs drive from Brisbane, and as it has been decided to run the Cleveland Railway through the Estate, it will be brought within a few minutes‚Äô ride of the heart of the city\\". The results of the public auction on 28 November 1885 were reported in the Telegraph newspaper with \\"forty-two lots were disposed of, comprising an area of 144 acres...\\" The Grassdale Land Company Limited later produced a plan of divisions of unsold land into 45 lots, listing the size and value of the lots at the time. The local government area Belmont Division was split from the Bulimba Division in 1894 and by 1901 this became the Belmont Shire. Belmont Shire was a larger area than Belmont today with parts now included in the suburb of Carindale and other suburbs. From 25 May 1912 the Belmont Shire Council operated the Belmont Tramway, a 3-foot 6 inches (1,067 mm) gauge steam tramway from Norman Park railway station to a terminus near the present State School.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, April 1959 pp49-52 The line closed following the amalgamation of Shire into the City of Greater Brisbane in 1925. In the , Belmont recorded a population of 4,594 people. In the Belmont has a population of 4,374 people. Education The public school for the area is Belmont State School opened in 1876. (). Amenities The Belmont Rifle Range () hosts a number of sport shooting clubs. It was the venue for shooting events for the 1982 Commonwealth Games and will host again the same events in 2018 Commonwealth Games, and site of the 2011 World Long Range Championships. To the south of the rifle range is Mount Petrie. Demographics In the , Belmont recorded a population of 4,594 people, 51.6% female and 48.4% male. The median age of the Belmont population was 37 years of age. 72.7% of people living in Belmont were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 5.3%, England 3.7%, South Africa 1.3%, Italy 0.9%, China 0.8%. 81.9% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 2.5% Greek, 1.4% Italian, 1.3% Hindi, 1.3% Mandarin, 0.9% Cantonese.

Alexander was the only Bar-Kays member not aboard that flight as the plane, a Beechcraft owned by Redding, only held eight occupants (Redding, five of the Bar-Kays, the pilot and Redding's road manager); it was Alexander's turn in the rotation to board a commercial flight to the next destination. Alexander had the task of identifying the bodies of his bandmates, as well as that of Redding. After the crash, Ben Cauley, the sole survivor among those who were aboard the plane, worked with Alexander to reform the band. Subsequent work included the soundtrack recording of the Academy Award-winning theme song from the 1971 feature film Shaft, on which Alexander played bass guitar.

Johnny Clegg, Renaud and Claude Six are listed as the executive producers in the liner notes. The CD and liner notes - with numerous typos - were produced by Marabi Productions. About the tracks \\"Daughter of Eden\\" is, as the liner notes say, a song for the Goddess. Johnny Clegg has stated how he is interested in the various Goddess mythologies in various cultures, and also, men's reactions to women. He maintains that men are slightly awed or puzzled by women, for the following reasons. First, man is born of woman - which implies woman came first. Secondly, men are born twice from women - once physically, and once intellectually, in that man receive their knowledge from women, viz. the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. \\"Jongosi\\" is derived from an Afrikaans phrase, literally meaning 'Young ox', and used to designate a particularly feisty and lively person. This track is a tribute to young sportsmen and women who are able to perform at their highest level under pressure. \\"Makhabeleni\\" is a tribute to all parents, and was born out of Johnny Clegg's impressions from his first visit to Zululand in 1970, to the eponymous village, with his friend Sipho Mchunu. Johnny was struck how Sipho referred to all men and women of his father's and mother's respective generations as 'Father' and 'Mother'. In a particular incident, one man called Sipho over and asked, 'How much money did you give your mother?'. Sipho gave his answer, to which the man replied, 'That's not enough! Give her more!' Johnny Clegg at first thought this was an unwarranted intrusion into his friend's affairs, but later came to understand that ALL parents and adults take an active and benevolent interest in the lives of the young people in the community. \\"Thamela\\" (Warm yourself in the sun), or 'Die Son Trek Water' (The sun draws water) is Johnny Clegg's first track to incorporate Afrikaans lyrics. It deals with migrant workers separated from their lovers for long periods of time, and the quality of their love. If it's like the ocean, it cannot be diminished by evaporation by the sun - or distance, as the case may be. \\"The Revolution Will Eat Its Children\\" is aimed squarely at Robert Mugabe. Johnny Clegg noted how much he - and the international community - respected Nelson Mandela's decision to step down at the end of his term as president. The suggestion in the song is that some other African rulers succumb to their lust for power, and that it would be better if they, too, step down gracefully. Tracks 6 and 16, \\"Utshani Obulele\\" refer to a Zulu proverb meaning 'The dry dead grass is made young and green by fire', and how every dark or painful incident in our lives has a positive aspect. While the theme of both tracks is similar, the lyrics deal with two separate incidents - track 6 seems to concern an adolescent love affair, while track 16 deals with betrayal by a neighbour (someone from the same village). \\"Touch the Sun\\" is a tribute to Johnny Clegg's sister, Diane, who died in 2004 at the age of 38 to cancer. The song is more positive and upbeat than the subject would suggest, and hints at Diane's acceptance and peace of mind near the end.

Compared to its predecessor, the D50, the D40 had several features removed, a few added, and a lower price: US$499.95 ESP as of November 2009 with the 18‚Äì55 mm G-II kit lens, positioning it as an entry-level model compared to the D80. The D40x (released March 6, 2007) has a 10-megapixel maximum resolution, up from 6 megapixels of the D40 and D50. The D40 was the first Nikon DSLR without an in-body focus motor. Autofocus requires the use of a lens with an integrated autofocus-motor. Despite being superseded by newer offerings, the Nikon D40 retained some significant advantages.  Features  Photo taken with a D40 The Nikon D40 was less expensive than the Canon EOS 400D (also known as the Rebel XTi in the United States), the Pentax K110D, and the Olympus E-400, and is competitively priced against high-end bridge cameras (the D40 and D40x do not have live preview, unlike bridge digitals). It was launched accompanied by a new small kit lens, the AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 18‚Äì55 mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II. The D40's small size and low price made it attractive to point-and-shoot photographers moving up to their first SLR, however it does contain features and improvements that would appeal to enthusiasts as well. Despite having a comparatively lower resolution for a DSLR introduced in 2006, the D40 held some benefits over its newer competition such as the Nikon D40x, D60, and Canon Rebels. Because only 6 megapixels are fit onto the standard Nikon DX format sensor, the sensitivity of each pixel is higher. The default sensitivity on the D40 is ISO 200, and the D40 adds an ISO 3200 speed (listed as \\"Hi1\\" in the camera menu) compared to the Nikon D50's maximum ISO 1600. The D40 has a very fast 1/500 flash sync, useful for daytime fill-flash. This compares to the typical 1/200 sync speed of other entry level and even some semi-pro DSLR cameras such as the Canon EOS 40D with its 1/250 sync speed. Due to its hybrid electronic/mechanical shutter, it is in fact possible to flash sync the D40 beyond its published 1/500 maximum sync speed up to its maximum shutter speed of 1/4000. The D40x does not share this ability. The D40 lacks a built-in autofocus motor, which means that only Nikon lenses designated with AF-I, AF-S or compatible focus motors can be used in autofocus mode.  Reception The Nikon D40 was tested by various independent reviewers, receiving generally very favorable comments for its ergonomics and image quality. It received some criticism for some of the compromises its designers made to keep the D40's price and size competitive. For example, Digital Photography Review, among many others, noted the loss of the screw-drive autofocus motor and the top LCD panel.  Nikon D40x  On March 6, 2007, Nikon introduced the D40X, a sister camera to the D40. While identical in external design to the D40, it has a 10.2-megapixel CCD sensor, continuous shooting up to 3 frames per second, and a base sensitivity of ISO 100 (as noted above, each pixel in the 10.2-megapixel sensor receives less light than the pixels in the D40 sensor). It has a flash sync speed of 1/200 seconds compared to the D40's 1/500 seconds. It is otherwise identical. The launch was accompanied by the introduction of a new consumer-level telephoto zoom with vibration reduction. Nikon ceased production of the D40X in December 2007, shortly before they introduced its successor, the Nikon D60.

Early life Grashey was born in 1925 in Port Arthur, Ontario (now known as Thunder Bay). As a teenager Grashey first dabbled as a songwriter, teaming up with singer Jim Amadeo (aka Buddy DeVal). Together they struggled for more than a decade trying to get a foothold in a music industry that was still in its infancy, especially in Canada, so most of their efforts were directed to record companies and publishing houses in the U.S. Producing career In the late 1950s, Grashey met Chuck Williams in Thunder Bay, and the pair moved to Vancouver where with the financial help of Norm Burley, a retired lumber industry executive, and Art Phillips (who would later become Mayor of Vancouver), they formed Zero Records. Don was the company's President, overseeing the A&R; Department and the publishing company Trilite Music. Grashey ran the business as he saw fit, signed the acts he wanted to record and promoted them without interference from any of the other shareholders. He had cheque-signing privileges for the company bank account to prevent any recurrence of a previous fiasco he had with Jury Records. In 1955, Grashey began to broaden his involvement in the music industry with this budding new star under his wing, Grashey wrote the song \\"Are You Mine\\", and had Myrna Lorrie and Buddy DeVal record it as a duet. Their Abbott Records release in 1955 zoomed to the top of the charts in the U.S. The classic song became so popular that two other duet versions were released simultaneously in the U.S. with Ginny Wright & Tom Tall scoring a #2 hit and Red Sovine and Goldie Hill earning a Top 20 hit‚Ä¶all charting and being played on radio at the same time. \\"Are You Mine\\" has since been recorded by George Jones & Margie Singleton, Ernest Tubb & Loretta Lynn, Lucille Starr & Bob Regan, Carroll Baker & Jerry Palmer, George & June Pasher, and others. In 1959, Williams heard Loretta Lynn perform at a backyard jam session held in a converted chicken coop \\"Honky Tonk Make Believe\\", Don Grashy - Co. Joseph Mauro,\\"MY RAMBLING HEART\\" (Washington. D.C., 1995), pp. 47 in Vancouver, British Columbia, just over the border from Custer, Washington where the singer was living with her husband and children. Williams and Grashey returned on a Sunday and Grashey believed she was 'terrific'. Grashey signed Lynn to Zero Records on February 1, 1960.Loretta Lynn's Lost Chapter, honkytonkgirl.ca; accessed January 3, 2018. In her 1976 autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter, Lynn credits the duo, as follows, \\"There was one fellow named Don Grashey who had some business sense, and he ran the record company for Mr. Burley.\\"\\"LORETTA LYNN: COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER\\" (Vintage Books eBook, N.Y., 2010, originally published Henry Regnery Co. Chicago, 1976), Chapter 13, p. 3 Grashey produced Lynn's first recording session which took place in Hollywood in March, 1960 and resulted in the hit single \\"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\\". The session used Western Recorders studio and Don Blake as engineer. The backup musicians were Speedy West as steel guitarist and leader of the band, Harold Hensely (fiddle), Roy Lanham (guitar), Al Williams (bass), and Muddy Berry (drums). Lynn did a second recording session for Zero records in 1960, after Grashey had left the company, and he believed that in later years she may have confused the two sessions, for the description of her Zero Records days that she gives in Coal Miner's Daughter contains inaccuracies.\\"Honky Tonk Make Believe\\", Don Grashy - Co. Joseph Mauro, \\"MY RAMBLING HEART\\" (Washington. D.C., 1995), p. 45 Songwriter, George Petralia - Carroll Baker - Producer Don Grashey Grashey and Williams were the driving forces behind the career of singer Carroll Baker. George Petralia, a songwriter and sculptor, heard Carroll Baker on a live radio show from the Hayloft Jamboree in Markham, Ontario, and he introduced her to Grashey, and sponsored her first recording. Grashey went on to produce her records and managed her career from the beginning until the late nineteen eighties. Petralia, who had written the song \\"Mem'ries of Home\\", asked Baker to record it; the resulting hit stayed on the charts for 26 weeks in 1970. Baker, \\"Canada's Queen of Country Music and Canada's First Lady of Country\\", was nominated for 18 years in a row in the Women's Country of the Year category. Carroll went on to win three Juno Awards. She was named entertainer of the year in 1979 and country artist of the year in 1980. She also received CCMA Awards as female vocalist of the year in 1982 and 1985, and for top-selling album (Hymns of Gold) in 1986, and for best-selling album (Christmas Carroll) in 1990. As a songwriter and music publisher, Grashey was nothing short of prolific. In addition to the mega success of \\"Are You Mine\\", his early career songwriting included recordings of \\"Are You The One\\" by Jim Reeves and \\"I'm Your Man (I'm Your Gal)\\" recorded by Nashville trio The Browns. In Canada, his songs were recorded by Jerry Palmer (who cut some 20 of Grashey's compositions, including the Top 10 hits, \\"Did I Forget To Tell Her\\", \\"Not Living, Not Dying (Just Hanging On)\\" and \\"A Picture‚Äôs Worth A Thousand Words\\". Grashey's 50-plus years were recognized in 1980 when he was presented with the RPM Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame Award; and in 1989 he was among the inaugural inductees into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. His career memorabilia is currently on display in the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame museum in Calgary. Death Grashey died on September 12, 2005 in hospital, a songwriter and producer best known for managing the careers of Canadian Country Music Hall of Famers Myrna Lorrie and Carroll Baker at the age of 79; Baker sang at his memorial. Ironically, Don Grashey's passing occurred on the morning of the presentation of the 2005 Canadian Country Music Awards Show, and came only 10 days after the death of his longtime music business partner and friend, Chuck Williams.Country Music News Obituaries - DON GRASHEY/CHUCK WILLIAMS 2007 Country News References Category:1925 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Canadian country songwriters Category:Canadian record producers Category:Canadian talent agents Category:Musicians from Thunder Bay Category:20th-century Canadian musicians ","title":"Don Grashey"},{"id":"7958612","text":"The Southwest Border Security Consortium (SBSC) is a joint venture of nine U.S. universities in the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas to develop and promote scientific and policy solutions to issues facing the United States-Mexico border region.

Geography Gundale is by road ESE of the Brisbane CBD. The average property size in Gumdale is approximately between making Gumdale consist mostly of acreages. However, access to Brisbane city is only 15 to 20 minutes away by car. Gumdale has several new development sites consisting of less than 5% of housing, the other 95% are acreages. It is Brisbane's nearest acreage suburb to the CBD.  History  Gumdale Hall on New Cleveland Road opened in 1937 The Grassdale Land Company Limited formed on 8 January 1885 to acquire the property known as Grassdale Paddocks, in the parish of Tingalpa, with registered shareholders holding 80 shares of 250 pounds each. This area is spread across the Brisbane suburbs of Gumdale, Belmont and Chandler. The company offered the land for auction in the Grassdale Estate later in 1885. The allotments were situated along Grassdale Road, London Road, Boston Road, Old Cleveland Road, Archer Street and four unnamed roads (later called Belmont Road, Stanborough Road, Tilley Road and New Cleveland Road). Prior to the sale extensive publicity was published in the Brisbane newspapers, calling for \\"the attention of the investor, capitalist, farmer, merchant, artizan [sic], and mechanic, and is only one hour‚Äôs drive from Brisbane, and as it has been decided to run the Cleveland Railway through the Estate, it will be brought within a few minutes‚Äô ride of the heart of the city\\". The results of the public auction on 28 November 1885 were reported in the Telegraph newspaper with \\"forty-two lots were disposed of, comprising an area of 144 acres...\\" The Grassdale Land Company Limited later produced a plan of divisions of unsold land into 45 lots, listing the size and value of the lots at the time.left Grassdale State School opened on 26 August 1935. In July 1942 it was renamed Gumdale State School. The Grassdale Public Hall opened on New Cleveland Road on Saturday 10 September 1937 after 21 months of fundraising. The Grassdale name refers the grass trees (Xanthorrhoeia) that grew in the district. When a post office was to be opened in 1941, it was desired to avoid confusion with Grassdale, South Australia and so it was announced in 1942 that the name was changed to Gumdale. St Francis' Anglican Church was dedicated in 1960. It held its last service on December 2005. It was at 281 Tilley Road (). The land was sold in 2006. As at 2020, the Eastside Village shopping centre is at that site. At the Gumdale had a population of 950 people. In the , Gumdale had a population of 2,118 people.

It is usually experienced by islands and coastal areas 10¬∞ to 20¬∞ north and south of the equator. There are two main seasons in a tropical marine climate: the wet season and the dry season. The annual rainfall is 1000 to over 1500 mm (39 to 59 inches). The temperature ranges from 20 ¬∞C to 35 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞ to 95 ¬∞F). The trade winds blow all year round and are moist, as they pass over warm seas. These climatic conditions are found, for example, across the Caribbean; the eastern coasts of Brazil, Madagascar and Queensland; and many islands in tropical waters.  Seasons  During the dry season there is less rainfall than in the wet season, but there is little variation in temperature between the two seasons. Tropical marine regions are influenced by anticyclones during the dry season and tropical waves during the wet season.  Ecosystem adaptations  The ecosystems of the tropical marine climate have to adapt to the dry season. Plants during the dry season must conserve water/moisture. However the extent of the adaptation depends much on the annual rainfall. Hygrophytic ecosystems occur when there is a short dry period with a few rain showers. The soil in this ecosystem holds adequate water for plant growth. Most of the tropical marine ecosystems are close to true rain forests. = Mesophytic ecosystem = The mesophytic ecosystem is also known as a semi-evergreen forest. It is found where there is a long dry season that has little rainfall. There is less vegetation than in a rainforest. There are only two tree stories; trees shed their leaves or have very small leaves. This provides the plants a way to conserve moisture. There are fewer epiphytes than a rain forest has as the canopy is dry. In the dry season the ground is covered by leaves that will not decay until the soil is moist. The trees often flower during the dry season and start to grow during the wet season. The soil is usually latasol. = Xerophytic ecosystem = The xerophytic ecosystem is also known as dry woodland. It is found in areas of rain shadow in the tropical marine climate. This ecosystem often develops soils that drain quickly. The dry woodland is very different from the rainforest. The biomass is a lot less than a rainforest as there is little rain. The tallest of trees are only 15 to 25 meters high in the dry woodland. Dry woodland trees either have small leaves or shed their leaves. The trees have very thick bark and the trunks are crooked. = Variations = Mangroves grow in coastal wetlands, which are called hydrophytic ecosystems. The vegetation at the coast are usually adapted to sandy soil. The montane forests and elfin woodlands grow on the cool, moist, mountainous regions.

Early life Esack was born into a poor Muslim family in the Wynberg suburb of Cape Town. While still a child, he and his mother were forcibly relocated as \\"non-Whites\\" under the provisions of the Group Areas Act. At age nine, Esack joined the revivalist Tablighi Jamaat movement, and by age 10 he was teaching at a madrasah (religious school). At the age of 15 he received a scholarship to pursue Islamic studies in Pakistan. By the time he left for Pakistan in 1974 he had also become the local chairman of an anti-apartheid group, National Youth Action, and had been detained several times by security police. Esack spent eight years as a student in Karachi, completing the traditional Dars-i-Nizami program of Islamic studies and becoming a mawlana or Muslim cleric. As he noted in the introduction to his book On Being a Muslim, some of his fellow students later joined the Taliban in Afghanistan. Having grown up with Christian neighbors, Esack became critical of discrimination against Christians and other religious minorities in Pakistan. Middle years Returning to South Africa in 1982, Esack became involved with activities of the Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa. He, along with three other members, left the organization in 1984 and helped form the Muslim anti-apartheid group Muslims Against Oppression, which later changed its name to Call of Islam, which became an important affiliate of the United Democratic Front. Esack addressed hundreds of protest meetings, formed ties with inter-faith opponents of apartheid, and became a leading figure within the World Conference of Religions for Peace. Esack founded Call of Islam with Adli Jacobs and his cousin, Ebrahim Rasool, who later became the Premier of the Western Cape and the South African ambassador to the United States. From 1984 to 1989, Esack was the National Coordinator of Call of Islam. This fulfilled his ambition of uniting the two halves of his personality ‚Äì the religious with secular activism. He addressed rallies, conducted political funerals, and participated in inter-faith organisations opposed to apartheid. He became an important leader in the World Conference on Religion and Peace. An interesting image is of him marching, Qur‚Äôan in hand, under the banner of the CPSA flag.http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/muslim_portraits_goolam_vahed_0.pdflink= In 1990 Esack left South Africa to continue his theological studies. He holds a PhD from the University of Birmingham, England, and pursued postdoctoral studies in Biblical hermeneutics at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology, Frankfurt, Germany. Esack has also been involved with the organisation Positive Muslims, which is dedicated to helping HIV-positive Muslims in Africa. Positive Muslims programs include prevention, lobbying, and research activities, but the main focus of the organisation's work is counseling and support for people living with HIV/AIDS. In May 2005 Farid Esack delivered the second Mandela Lecture sponsored by the Netherlands Institute for Southern Africa, Amsterdam. In 2007-2008 Esack was the Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Visiting Professor of Islamic Studies at Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Esack served as a Commissioner for Gender Equality in South African and has taught at the Universities of Western Cape, and Hamburg, the College of William & Mary and Union Theological Seminary (NY) and at Xavier University in Cincinnati. He is currently a professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. He is head of the South-African branch of BDS. He was responsible for the boycott of Ben Gurion University by the University of Johannesburg. In 2013, Esack said that BDS distanced themselves from the singing of \\"shoot the Jew\\" in song during a protest at Wits University's Great Hall. \\"We unequivocally distance ourselves from the singing of this song and its sentiments. Also, to tarnish all Jews with the Zionist brush is racism regardless of who does it. Racism is racism and racism is abominable.\\" Esack also bemoaned the advantage the incident had given the organisation's detractors. \\"It is unfortunate but not unexpected that supporters of Israel will focus on the singing of this song,\\" he said. \\"The purpose and context of the protest were and remain the larger struggle against Israeli apartheid, Israel's illegal occupation and its violation of Palestinian rights.\\" In 2015 in the wake of 132 deaths caused by terror attacks in France, Esack lashed out at Western powers that had waged war on Muslim countries and that supported the invasion of Muslim countries. \\"I am not praying for Paris; I am not condemning anyone. Why the hell should I? I had nothing to do with it,\\" \\"I am sickened by the perpetual expectations to condemn. I walk away from your shitty racist and Islamophobic expectations that whenever your chickens come home to roost then I must feign horror\\". \\"Stop supporting and funding terror outfits, get out of other people's lands and continents, stop outlawing peaceful resistance such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, to occupations, abandon your cultural imperialism, destroy your arms industry that provides the weapons that kill hundreds of thousands of others every year\\". \\"The logic is quite simple: When you eat, it's stupid to expect that no shit will ever come out from your body. Yes, I feel sorry for the victims on whom the shit falls. But, bloody hell, own it; it's yours!\\" In 2018, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa granted Esack the Order of Luthuli (Silver) for \\"his brilliant contribution to academic research and to the fight against race, gender, class and religious oppression. His body of work continues to enlighten generations of fledgling and established academics\\". Books by Farid Esack *The Struggle. (1988) *But Musa went to Fir'aun!

He wrote music for piano, horns, woodwinds and orchestra, composing more than 40 works in a span of less than five years leading up to the time of his death in November 2006. Biography Cornwall was born in Denver, Colorado. Trained as a trombonist, Cornwall performed professionally with the New York City Opera and D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Central City Opera, where he performed in the world premiere of The Ballad of Baby Doe by Douglas Moore. After studying math and physics at Harvard College for one and a half years, he dropped out in 1957. Returning to Denver, he worked a systems engineer for United Airlines while performing for the Denver Philharmonic Orchestra (then known as the Denver Businessmen's Orchestra) and studying under its conductor, Antonia Brico. He was drafted by the US Army in 1961 and contributed to developing large systems for the Pentagon's National Military Command and Control Center, where he was named Chief Programmer for global nuclear war-game exercises. After receiving an honorable discharge from the army, Cornwall returned to the airline industry, where he developed some of the first online systems for flight planning and real-time monitoring. Later in his career he received an MBA in economics from the University of Chicago. Composer career Upon his retirement in 2001, Cornwall returned to music, this time as a composer. Over the next five years, he composed dozens of works at the University of Denver Lamont School of Music. Initially composing in neo-classical and neo-baroque styles, his compositions took a modern turn, reflecting the influences of Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, Witold Lutos≈Çawski and Arnold Schoenberg, among others. Cornwall's orchestral works have been performed by the Lamont Symphony Orchestra, including March of the Bride and Groom (2004), Parade of the Wedding Party (2005), The Grieving Maiden (2005), Triple Concerto for Piano, Violin and Cello: Birth of a Mountain River (2006) and Sonata for Violin and Piano (2006). Death In late September 2006, several weeks after producing a draft of his final composition, Lullaby for Kayleigh, Cornwall developed severe sepsis following intestinal surgery. He died of complications from his illness on November 7, 2006 in Lone Tree, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. As part of his funeral the following week, his Fugue in Four Parts was performed on the pipe organ at the Cathedral of St. John in the Wilderness, Denver.

Plot S.D. Blass (Art Garfunkel) is a beat journalist for the Washington Daily Tribune newspaper in Washington, D.C. His editor-in-chief pressures him to deliver more featured stories, as it's been too long since Blass has had a decent article printed. Blass reaches out to Matthew Harrigan (Harris Yulin), a detective for the Washington Metropolitan Police department, looking for a good story to pursue. He learns about a nurse that was raped and murdered on her way home after working the night shift at Washington Metropolitan Hospital. Unbeknownst to Blass, the detective had fabricated the police report and placed the primary blame on go-go music and its concert goers. Blass take the story and publishes it with the title: \\"Nurse Murdered at Go-Go: Music and Drugs Blamed for Violence.\\" Meanwhile, Max (the owner of \\"Maxx Saxx Entertainment\\") manages three of the city's top go-go bands. After fifteen years of playing at local clubs, he feels the timing is perfect to take go-go music nationally. He arranges a sit-down meeting at the Watergate complex with Gil Colton (an L.A.-based record producer) hoping he'll sign his artists to a recording contract. Colton loves the music and the band's energy when performing live at the local clubs. However, he's worried about all of the bad press and media attention that's associated with the live performances. Because of this, he decides not to sign the artist and heads back to L.A. Little Beats (an up-and-coming conga player for one of Max's go- go bands) has an older brother (\\"Chemist\\") who was once a promising college student majoring in chemistry. However, he started using illegal drugs, primarily PCP (aka \\"Luv Boat\\"), and is now robbing and stealing to finance his drug addiction. He also hangs with Mr. Ain't (Fred Brathwaite) and his street crew as they travel around the city wreaking havoc, including the rape and murder of the nurse. Eventually, this leads to Chemist being falsely accused and charged with the murder and rape. Little Beats is apprehended by Det. Harrigan, with hopes of getting more information of Chemist's whereabouts. Blass, now aware that the detective has been fabricating many of his police reports, has chosen to disassociate himself with Harrigan. He gets in touch with Little Beats, Chemist, and their mother and works to clear Chemist of the allegations, along with exposing the police misconduct of Det. Harrigan. Cast * Art Garfunkel as S.D.

The film premiered on July 31, 1986 at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. before being released nationally on August 1, 1986. Due to poor box office performance, the film was pulled shortly after its nationwide release. The film was repackaged under the title Short Fuse and released on VHS thereafter.

(1992), Microeconomic Analysis, Vol. 3. New York: W.W. Norton. This corresponds to the standard economic view of a consumer reservation price. Some researchers, however, conceptualize WTP as a range. According to the constructive preference view, consumer willingness to pay is a context-sensitive construct; that is, a consumer's WTP for a product depends on the concrete decision context. For example, consumers tend to be willing to pay more for a soft drink in a luxury hotel resort in comparison to a beach bar or a local retail store.  Measurement  Accurately gauging consumers' willingness to pay for a product or service is critical for formulating competitive strategies, conducting value audits, and developing new products.Anderson, James C., Dipak Jain, and Pradeep K. Chintagunta (1993), \\"Understanding Customer Value in Business Markets: Methods of Customer Value Assessment,\\" Journal of Business-to- Business Marketing, 1 (1), 3‚Äì30. It is also important for implementing various pricing tactics, such as nonlinear pricing, one-to-one pricing, and targeted promotions. Not surprisingly, several approaches have been developed for this purpose. Many methods to measure WTP were presented in the literature.Breidert Christoph, Hahsler, Michael, and Reutterer (2006), \\"A Review of Methods for Measuring Willingness-to-Pay\\", Innovative Marketing, 2(4), 8‚Äì32. The approaches to measure consumer WTP can be differentiated whether they measure WTP directly or indirectly and whether they measure consumer hypothetical or actual WTP.Miller, Klaus M., Hofstetter, Reto, Krohmer, Harley, Zhang, John Z. (2011), \\"How Should Consumers' Willingness to Pay be Measured? An Empirical Comparison of State-of-the-Art Approaches\\", Journal of Marketing Research. In practice, some researchers favor the direct approach, asking consumers directly to state their WTP for a specific product through, for example, an open-ended (OE) question format. Others prefer an indirect approach, such as choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis, in which WTP is calculated on the basis of consumers' choices among several product alternatives and a \\"none\\" choice option. However, neither method is foolproof. Many studies have shown that both direct and indirect approaches can generate inaccurate results for various psychological and technical reasons. More fundamentally, both approaches measure consumers' hypothetical, rather than actual, WTP and thus can generate hypothetical bias, which the economics literature defines as the bias induced by the hypothetical nature of a task. A direct approach to elicit actual WTP is a mechanism that Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak (1964) propose (Becker‚ÄìDeGroot‚ÄìMarschak method), in which a participant is obligated to purchase a product if the price drawn from a lottery is less than or equal to his or her stated WTP.Wertenbroch, Klaus and Bernd Skiera (2002), \\"Measuring Consumers' Willingness to Pay at the Point of Purchase,\\" Journal of Marketing Research, 39 (May), 228‚Äì41. An indirect approach for determining actual WTP is the incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint (ICBC) analysis, in which participants are also obligated to make a purchase based on WTP inferred from their revealed preference, using the BDM mechanism. With more realistic economic incentives for survey respondents, these two approaches have generated good results in some applications. However, an actual WTP generated with these methods may not always be accurate, because it may differ from the WTP shown in real consumer purchases.

Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.\\" * Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.\\" * Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... were at Tora Bora.\\" * Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada was listed as one of the captives who was an \\"al Qaeda operative\\". * Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada was listed as one of the \\"82 detainees made no statement to CSRT or ARB tribunals or made statements that do not bear materially on the military‚Äôs allegations against them.\\" A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, on October 13, 2004. A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada's first annual Administrative Review Board, on June 21, 2005. A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Tareq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Baada's second annual Administrative Review Board, on March 22, 2006. =Habeas corpus petition= A habeas corpus was filed on this captive's behalf. In September 2007, the Department of Justice published dossiers of unclassified documents arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives. This habeas was not among those published. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated. The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of \\"enemy combatant\\". On July 16, 2008, Julia Symon filed a \\"UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR EXPEDITED ENTRY OF PROTECTIVE ORDER\\" on behalf of Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed Ba Odah, Tariq Ali Abdullah Ba Odah, Nasser Ali Abdullah Odah in Civil Action No. 06-cv-1668 (HHK). On June 26, 2015, Courthouse News reported that Baada's lawyer, Omar Farah, filed requests for his rapid transfer from Guantanamo because his weight had fallen dangerously low. His weight was so low his lawyers found him barely recognizable. Medical experts tell them his health is now so fragile that he could die from a simple infection. They said that, even if he escaped accidental death, death would be an inevitable consequence of weight so low. His lawyers quoted policy on repatriating those with a \\"chronic disease\\", and argued he met the criteria for repatriation under this policy. =Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment= On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts. A Joint Task Force Guantanamo detainee assessment was drafted on January 13, 2008. It was ten pages long, and was signed by camp commandant Rear Admiral Mark H. Buzby. He recommended continued detention. =Guantanamo Review Task Force= On January 21, 2009, the day he was inaugurated, United States President Barack Obama issued three Executive orders related to the detention of individuals in Guantanamo. He established a task force to re- review the status of all the remaining captives. Where the OARDEC officials reviewing the status of the captives were all \\"field grade\\" officers in the US military (Commanders, naval Captains, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels) the officials seconded to the task force were drawn from not only the Department of Defense, but also from five other agencies, including the Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security. President Obama gave the task force a year, and it recommended the release of Baada and 54 other individuals. 2016-04-16 transfer On Saturday April 16, 2016, Baada and eight other individuals from Yemen were transferred from Guantanamo. Most media sources reported that all nine men were transferred to Saudi Arabia, but the New York Times only reported that the eight other men were transferred to Saudi Arabia. They reported that Baada's host country was unknown. The transfer came a week before President Obama was scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia.

History =Founding= The school was established by West Virginia University in September 1925 as University Demonstration High School. It was not uncommon in the south for colleges to found \\"demonstration schools\\", ostensibly as a place for students to learn educational techniques, but also because many professors were unwilling to send their children to public schools of that era. It was originally located in the Old Tea Room on the corner of Willey and Spruce Streets. The school had 35 students and three teachers, and quickly attracted more. In 1928, strained with over two hundred students, the school was relocated to the third and fourth floors of a building on the corner of Stewart Street and University Avenue. In 1930, construction on University Demonstration High began. The school occupied the old library on the West Virginia University Campus until 1933, when the building was complete, at an estimated cost of $283,837, the school is located at the top of North Price Street. =Public= When, in 1972, West Virginia University no longer had need of the demonstration school, it was turned over to the Monongalia County Public School System. Morgantown High School district was divided and University High School was established as a second regular public high school. The school underwent major renovations and refurbishment, including the addition of a gymnasium and annex. In 2006, construction began on a new campus for University High. This new facility, part of a bond issue passed by the citizens of Monongalia County in 2003, is located north of Morgantown along Bakers Ridge Road. The $35 million project includes a two- story classroom building, a greenhouse, a 2000-seat gymnasium, a 400-seat auxiliary gymnasium and an approximately 700 seat auditorium. In addition to the building, the campus also includes a new 4000 seat stadium for field sports, as well as multiple athletic and physical education fields. The building was designed by the award-winning Charleston WV architectural firm of Williamson Shriver Architects. While the football team played its 2008 home games at the new high school (Mylan Pharmaceuticals Stadium), students did not arrive at the new University High until December 2008. On Wednesday, November 19, 2008 the old school on Price Street welcomed students for the last time, and students started school at the new location on December 3, 2008. Just after a few days, the building experienced minor flooding as a result of a heating issue that activated the sprinkler system. The building that once held University High School now houses Mountaineer Middle School, formerly Cheat Lake Middle School. http://boe.mono.k12.wv.us/uhs/aboutuhs/history/main.html Academic Program University High School offers 24 Advanced Placement courses, one of the largest AP programs in West Virginia.

Origin Shortly after Hulk was banished to the Crossroads (a dimension of infinite time and space containing an infinite number of gateways to any and all worlds and dimensions, where Hulk could hopefully find a world where he would finally know peace) by Doctor Strange for becoming too great a danger to himself and others, Hulk met an entity called the Puffball Collective. The Puffball Collective was composed of a multitude of pale yellow thistle-like puffballs. The Puffball Collective tried help the Hulk, who had lost all of Bruce Banner's intellect and persona and now had the mentality of a feral animal. The Puffball Collective inspired the Hulk to try to think and survive, to try to find food to eat before the Hulk starved to death. The Puffball Collective would sometime psychically probe Hulk's mind just to get a response out of him.The Incredible Hulk #301. Marvel Comics. Though the Puffball Collective could not leave the Crossroads, it and the Hulk defeated the U-Foes, who had accidentally trapped themselves there. Later the Hulk and the Puffball Collective became part of the crew of the space vessel Andromeda, helmed by Xeron the Starslayer and Captain Cybor. With the help of a powerful force field the Puffball Collective was finally able to leave the Crossroads and help the crew of the Andromeda pursue Klaatu the Energy Eater.The Incredible Hulk #304-306. Marvel Comics. After Hulk and the Puffball Collective returned to the Crossroads, the Puffball Collective asked the Hulk to help it return to it homeworld. A world it described as a paradise until it was destroyed by a dark evil that had spread across the land. Though it could now leave the Crossroads, the gateway to its world was barricaded by chains which the Puffball Collective lacked the strength to break but the Hulk could.The Incredible Hulk #307. Marvel Comics. Finding the Puffball Collective's world was now a desolate wasteland, the Hulk finally learned the truth. The Puffball Collective was once part of a greater worldwide Collective. The small faction of the greater Collective which was the Puffball Collective secretly studied arcane magic. Using this magic it summoned a horde of demons. The N'Garai demons quickly started killing the Collective and destroying the planet. When the worldwide Collective discovered that the Puffball Collective was responsible for summoning the N'Garai demons, the worldwide Collective exiled the Puffball Collective to the Crossroads. Betrayed to the N'Garai by the Puffball Collective, the Hulk escaped with the help of three parts of his subconscious who manifested themselves as the entities Glow, Guardian, and Goblin. Once back at the Crossroads the Hulk quickly repaired the chains that had once blocked the gateway to the Puffball Collective's world, leaving the Puffball Collective to be destroyed by the very demons he summoned ages ago.Incredible Hulk #308. Marvel Comics. Physical attributes The Puffball Collective generally appeared as a nondescript pile of pale yellow fluff. Though it could imitate the shape of anything it encountered, it appeared to be limited to roughly its own size which was between 6 and 8 feet tall. It also could not duplicate that object's ability ( I.E. It could not lift any kind great weights like the Hulk.) The Puffball Collective could not be harmed by physical force. It could only be scattered and could simply just reform its shape. It was however vulnerable to heat and fire. The Puffball Collective was also a telepath. It could probe the mind of the Hulk and read it like a book (note that at the time the Hulk had the mind of the Savage Hulk and only a few of Banner's memories). It could also project its thoughts. Though it is never stated, one could surmise that these abilities may come from living as part of a collective of billions of such creatures.

The Administrative Review Boards were not authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they were not authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an \\"enemy combatant\\". They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat‚Äîor whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free. =First annual Administrative Review Board= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Turki Mash Awi Zayid Al Asiri's first annual Administrative Review Board, on 9 September 2005. The memo listed factors for and against his continued detention. The four page memo listed twenty-six \\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\\" and two \\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\\".

The memo listed factors for and against his continued detention. Repatriation On November 25, 2008, the Department of Defense published a list of when captives left Guantanamo. According to that list he was repatriated to Saudi custody on November 9, 2007, with thirteen other men. The records published from the captives' annual Administrative Reviews show his repatriation was not the outcome of the formal internal review procedures. The records show his detention was not reviewed in 2007. At least ten other men in his release group were not repatriated through the formal review procedure. Peter Taylor writing for the BBC News called the Saudis repatriated on November 9, 2007, with Al Assiri, \\"batch 10\\". He wrote that the BBC's research had found this batch to be a problematic cohort, and that four other men from this batch were named on the Saudi most wanted list.

For example, a top-down cascade will occur if predators are effective enough in predation to reduce the abundance, or alter the behavior, of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate trophic level is a herbivore). The trophic cascade is an ecological concept which has stimulated new research in many areas of ecology. For example, it can be important for understanding the knock-on effects of removing top predators from food webs, as humans have done in many places through hunting and fishing. A top-down cascade is a trophic cascade where the top consumer/predator controls the primary consumer population. In turn, the primary producer population thrives. The removal of the top predator can alter the food web dynamics. In this case, the primary consumers would overpopulate and exploit the primary producers. Eventually there would not be enough primary producers to sustain the consumer population. Top-down food web stability depends on competition and predation in the higher trophic levels. Invasive species can also alter this cascade by removing or becoming a top predator. This interaction may not always be negative. Studies have shown that certain invasive species have begun to shift cascades; and as a consequence, ecosystem degradation has been repaired. For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, smaller fish that eat zooplankton, should decrease. The resulting increase in zooplankton should, in turn, cause the biomass of its prey, phytoplankton, to decrease. In a bottom-up cascade, the population of primary producers will always control the increase/decrease of the energy in the higher trophic levels. Primary producers are plants, phytoplankton and zooplankton that require photosynthesis. Although light is important, primary producer populations are altered by the amount of nutrients in the system. This food web relies on the availability and limitation of resources. All populations will experience growth if there is initially a large amount of nutrients. In a subsidy cascade, species populations at one trophic level can be supplemented by external food. For example, native animals can forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat, such a native predators eating livestock. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem and causing an ecological cascade. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living in protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations. This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‚Äòcascading‚Äô effects on forest tree community. Specifically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scrofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegetation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross- boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges. These trophic interactions shape patterns of biodiversity globally. Humans and climate change have affected these cascades drastically. One example can be seen with sea otters (Enhydra lutris) on the Pacific coast of the United States of America. Over time, human interactions caused a removal of sea otters. One of their main prey, the pacific purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) eventually began to overpopulate. The overpopulation caused increased predation of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). As a result, there was extreme deterioration of the kelp forests along the California coast. This is why it is important for countries to regulate marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Predator-induced interactions could heavily influence the flux of atmospheric carbon if managed on a global scale. For example, a study was conducted to determine the cost of potential stored carbon in living kelp biomass in sea otter (Enhydra lutris) enhanced ecosystems. The study valued the potential storage between $205 million and $408 million dollars (US) on the European Carbon Exchange (2012).  Origins and theory  Aldo Leopold is generally credited with first describing the mechanism of a trophic cascade, based on his observations of overgrazing of mountain slopes by deer after human extermination of wolves.Leopold, A. (1949) \\"Thinking like a mountain\\" in \\"Sand county almanac\\" Nelson Hairston, Frederick E. Smith and Lawrence B. Slobodkin are generally credited with introducing the concept into scientific discourse, although they did not use the term either. Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin argued that predators reduce the abundance of herbivores, allowing plants to flourish. This is often referred to as the green world hypothesis. The green world hypothesis is credited with bringing attention to the role of top-down forces (e.g. predation) and indirect effects in shaping ecological communities. The prevailing view of communities prior to Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin was trophodynamics, which attempted to explain the structure of communities using only bottom-up forces (e.g. resource limitation). Smith may have been inspired by the experiments of a Czech ecologist, Hrb√°ƒçek, whom he met on a United States State Department cultural exchange. Hrb√°ƒçek had shown that fish in artificial ponds reduced the abundance of zooplankton, leading to an increase in the abundance of phytoplankton. Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin feuded that the ecological communities acted as food chains with three trophic levels. Subsequent models expanded the argument to food chains with more than or fewer than three trophic levels. Lauri Oksanen argued that the top trophic level in a food chain increases the abundance of producers in food chains with an odd number of trophic levels (such as in Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin's three trophic level model), but decreases the abundance of the producers in food chains with an even number of trophic levels. Additionally, he argued that the number of trophic levels in a food chain increases as the productivity of the ecosystem increases.  Criticisms  Although the existence of trophic cascades is not controversial, ecologists have long debated how ubiquitous they are. Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin argued that terrestrial ecosystems, as a rule, behave as a three trophic level trophic cascade, which provoked immediate controversy. Some of the criticisms, both of Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin's model and of Oksanen's later model, were: *Plants possess numerous defenses against herbivory, and these defenses also contribute to reducing the impact of herbivores on plant populations. *Herbivore populations may be limited by factors other than food or predation, such as nesting sites or available territory. *For trophic cascades to be ubiquitous, communities must generally act as food chains, with discrete trophic levels. Most communities, however, have complex food webs. In real food webs, consumers often feed at multiple trophic levels (omnivory), organisms often change their diet as they grow larger, cannibalism occurs, and consumers are subsidized by inputs of resources from outside the local community, all of which blur the distinctions between trophic levels. Antagonistically, this principle is sometimes called the \\"trophic trickle\\".Eisenberg, Cristina (2011) \\"The Wolf's Tooth: Keystone Predators, Trophic Cascades, and Biodiversity pp. 15. Island Press. .Barbosa P and Castellanos I (Eds) (2005) Ecology of Predator-Prey Interactions pp. 306, Oxford University Press..  Classic examples  Healthy Pacific kelp forests, like this one at San Clemente Island of California's Channel Islands, have been shown to flourish when sea otters are present. When otters are absent, sea urchin populations can irrupt and severely degrade the kelp forest ecosystem. Although Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin formulated their argument in terms of terrestrial food chains, the earliest empirical demonstrations of trophic cascades came from marine and, especially, aquatic ecosystems. Some of the most famous examples are: * In North American lakes, piscivorous fish can dramatically reduce populations of zooplanktivorous fish; zooplanktivorous fish can dramatically alter freshwater zooplankton communities, and zooplankton grazing can in turn have large impacts on phytoplankton communities. Removal of piscivorous fish can change lake water from clear to green by allowing phytoplankton to flourish. * In the Eel River, in Northern California, fish (steelhead and roach) consume fish larvae and predatory insects. These smaller predators prey on midge larvae, which feed on algae. Removal of the larger fish increases the abundance of algae. * In Pacific kelp forests, sea otters feed on sea urchins. In areas where sea otters have been hunted to extinction, sea urchins increase in abundance and kelp populations are reduced. * A classic example of a terrestrial trophic cascade is the reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, which reduced the number, and changed the behavior, of elk (Cervus canadensis). This in turn released several plant species from grazing pressure and subsequently led to the transformation of riparian ecosystems. This example of a trophic cascade is vividly shown and explained in the viral video \\"How Wolves Change Rivers\\".\\"How Wolves Change Rivers\\"  Terrestrial trophic cascades  The fact that the earliest documented trophic cascades all occurred in lakes and streams led a scientist to speculate that fundamental differences between aquatic and terrestrial food webs made trophic cascades primarily an aquatic phenomenon. Trophic cascades were restricted to communities with relatively low species diversity, in which a small number of species could have overwhelming influence and the food web could operate as a linear food chain. Additionally, well documented trophic cascades at that point in time all occurred in food chains with algae as the primary producer. Trophic cascades, Strong argued, may only occur in communities with fast- growing producers which lack defenses against herbivory. Subsequent research has documented trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems, including: * In the coastal prairie of Northern California, yellow bush lupines are fed upon by a particularly destructive herbivore, the root-boring caterpillar of the ghost moth. Entomopathogenic nematodes kill the caterpillars, and can increase the survival and seed production of lupines. * In Costa Rican rain forest, a Clerid beetle specializes in eating ants. The ant Pheidole bicornis has a mutualistic association with Piper plants: the ant lives on the Piper and removes caterpillars and other insect herbivores. The Clerid beetle, by reducing the abundance of ants, increases the leaf area removed from Piper plants by insect herbivores. Critics pointed out that published terrestrial trophic cascades generally involved smaller subsets of the food web (often only a single plant species). This was quite different from aquatic trophic cascades, in which the biomass of producers as a whole were reduced when predators were removed. Additionally, most terrestrial trophic cascades did not demonstrate reduced plant biomass when predators were removed, but only increased plant damage from herbivores. It was unclear if such damage would actually result in reduced plant biomass or abundance. In 2002 a meta-analysis found trophic cascades to be generally weaker in terrestrial ecosystems, meaning that changes in predator biomass resulted in smaller changes in plant biomass. In contrast, a study published in 2009 demonstrated that multiple species of trees with highly varying autecologies are in fact heavily impacted by the loss of an apex predator.Beschta, R.L., and W.J. Ripple. 2009. Large predators and trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems of the western United States Biological Conservation. 142, 2009: 2401-2414. Another study, published in 2011, demonstrated that the loss of large terrestrial predators also significantly degrades the integrity of river and stream systems, impacting their morphology, hydrology, and associated biological communities. The critics' model is challenged by studies accumulating since the reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park. The gray wolf, after being extirpated in the 1920s and absent for 70 years, was reintroduced to the park in 1995 and 1996. Since then a three-tiered trophic cascade has been reestablished involving wolves, elk (Cervus elaphus), and woody browse species such as aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.). Mechanisms likely include actual wolf predation of elk, which reduces their numbers, and the threat of predation, which alters elk behavior and feeding habits, resulting in these plant species being released from intensive browsing pressure. Subsequently, their survival and recruitment rates have significantly increased in some places within Yellowstone's northern range. This effect is particularly noted among the range's riparian plant communities, with upland communities only recently beginning to show similar signs of recovery. Examples of this phenomenon include: * A 2-3 fold increase in deciduous woody vegetation cover, mostly of willow, in the Soda Butte Creek area between 1995 and 1999. * Heights of the tallest willows in the Gallatin River valley increasing from 75 cm to 200 cm between 1998 and 2002. * Heights of the tallest willows in the Blacktail Creek area increased from less than 50 cm to more than 250 cm between 1997 and 2003. Additionally, canopy cover over streams increased significantly, from only 5% to a range of 14-73%. * In the northern range, tall deciduous woody vegetation cover increased by 170% between 1991 and 2006. * In the Lamar and Soda Butte Valleys the number of young cottonwood trees that had been successfully recruited went from 0 to 156 between 2001 and 2010. Trophic cascades also impact the biodiversity of ecosystems, and when examined from that perspective wolves appear to be having multiple, positive cascading impacts on the biodiversity of Yellowstone National Park. These impacts include: This diagram illustrates trophic cascade caused by removal of the top predator. When the top predator is removed the population of deer is able to grow unchecked and this causes over-consumption of the primary producers. * Scavengers, such as ravens (Corvus corax), bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), and even grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis), are likely subsidized by the carcasses of wolf kills. * In the northern range, the relative abundance of six out of seven native songbirds which utilize willow was found to be greater in areas of willow recovery as opposed to those where willows remained suppressed. * Bison (Bison bison) numbers in the northern range have been steadily increasing as elk numbers have declined, presumably due to a decrease in interspecific competition between the two species. * Importantly, the number of beaver (Castor canadensis) colonies in the park has increased from one in 1996 to twelve in 2009. The recovery is likely due to the increase in willow availability, as they have been feeding almost exclusively on it. As keystone species, the resurgence of beaver is a critical event for the region. The presence of beavers has been shown to positively impact streambank erosion, sediment retention, water tables, nutrient cycling, and both the diversity and abundance of plant and animal life among riparian communities. There are a number of other examples of trophic cascades involving large terrestrial mammals, including: * In both Zion National Park and Yosemite National Park, the increase in human visitation during the first half of the 20th century was found to correspond to the decline of native cougar (Puma concolor) populations in at least part of their range. Soon after, native populations of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) erupted, subjecting resident communities of cottonwoods (Populus fremontii) in Zion and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) in Yosemite to intensified browsing. This halted successful recruitment of these species except in refugia inaccessible to the deer. In Zion the suppression of cottonwoods increased stream erosion and decreased the diversity and abundance of amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and wildflowers. In parts of the park where cougars were still common these negative impacts were not expressed and riparian communities were significantly healthier. * In sub-Saharan Africa, the decline of lion (Panthera leo) and leopard (Panthera pardus) populations has led to a rising population of olive baboon (Papio anubis). This case of mesopredator release negatively impacted already declining ungulate populations and is one of the reasons for increased conflict between baboons and humans, as the primates raid crops and spread intestinal parasites. * In the Australian states of New South Wales and South Australia, the presence or absence of dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) was found to be inversely related to the abundance of invasive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). In other words, the foxes were most common where the dingoes were least common. Subsequently, populations of an endangered prey species, the dusky hopping mouse (Notomys fuscus) were also less abundant where dingoes were absent due to the foxes, which consume the mice, no longer being held in check by the top predator. Marine trophic cascades In addition to the classic examples listed above, more recent examples of trophic cascades in marine ecosystems have been identified: * An example of a cascade in a complex, open- ocean ecosystem occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller forage fishes and invertebrates such as the northern snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect. * A similar cascade, also involving the Atlantic cod, occurred in the Baltic Sea at the end of the 1980s. After a decline in Atlantic cod, the abundance of its main prey, the sprat (Sprattus sprattus), increased and the Baltic Sea ecosystem shifted from being dominated by cod into being dominated by sprat. The next level of trophic cascade was a decrease in the abundance of Pseudocalanus acuspes, a copepod which the sprat prey on. * On Caribbean coral reefs, several species of angelfishes and parrotfishes eat species of sponges that lack chemical defenses. Removal of these sponge-eating fish species from reefs by fish- trapping and netting has resulted in a shift in the sponge community toward fast-growing sponge species that lack chemical defenses. These fast-growing sponge species are superior competitors for space, and overgrow and smother reef-building corals to a greater extent on overfished reefs.

It is east of the CBD. History Manly West originally was a part of the suburb of Manly (which takes its name from Manly, New South Wales). It was officially gazetted as a separate suburb in 1975. Moreton Bay Girls' High School opened on 31 January 1901 on Bay Terrace Wynnum with 20 day students and 6 boarding students. It was established by Alice J Alison Greene and her sister Anne. In 1944 the Greene family gave the school to the Methodist Church which transferred it to the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools‚Äô Association. In 1957, the school was renamed Moreton Bay College. In 1975 the PMSA decided to close the school due to a slump in student numbers to 125. Negative reaction from parents and the community resulted in the Uniting Church taking back control of the school and establishing an independent board to pursue a new strategic plan. The boarding school closed in 1980. In 1981 a new site of was purchased in Wondall Road in Manly West. The primary school commenced operations on the new site at the start of 1984 with the secondary school relocating at the start of 1986. The school celebrated its centenary in 2001 with an enrolment of 1,170 students. In April 2003 the Upper Brookfield Uniting church building was relocated to the school for use as a chapel. Manly West State School opened on 28 January 1958. The swimming pool was added in 1977. Wondall Road State School opened on 12 September 1966. In 1967 it was renamed Wondall Heights State School.

The school offers a 10-semester Magister in Catholic Theology and a 6-semester Bachelor in Philosophy. Post- graduate students may earn the degrees of Licentiate (Lic. theol.), Doctorate (Dr. theol., Ph.D.), or Habilitation (Dr. theol. habil.). Additional interdisciplinary programs are offered as well.  Campus and Institutions  The campus, situated within a historic park in the Sachsenhausen district of Frankfurt, contains the classroom building, the office building (Lindenhaus), the academic library, the college restaurant (Mensa), the major seminary, the college church, and the Jesuit community. The campus hosts as well two institutions founded by the German Bishops' Conference: the \\"Institute for Global Church and Mission (IWM)\\" and an Institute for Christian-Muslim relations (\\"Cibedo\\"). Its library, with more than 12,000 volumes, stands out as the largest library for Christian-Muslim dialogue in Germany. The main college library, which incorporated the collections of various Jesuit libraries and holds nearly 500,000 volumes, is known for its rich collection of Jesuit-related literature. In the interdiocesan major seminary, 30 seminarians of several German dioceses, mainly of Limburg, Hamburg, Osnabr√ºck, Hildesheim, are studying for the Roman Catholic priesthood. 20 post-graduate students, mostly priests, from all over the world are living in the same seminary, pursuing doctoral or licentiate programs.  History  The 2005 classroom building and the park behind the college The school was founded in 1926 by the Society of Jesus as an academic seminary for training candidates to the priesthood, initially only for the Diocese of Limburg, but soon for other German dioceses as well. Until 1951 the school was exclusively an (inter-)diocesan seminary, led by Jesuits. From 1951 until 1975, the school included two parallel institutions: the \\"Philosophical-Theological Academy\\" for diocesan candidates and the \\"Theological Faculty S.J.\\" for Jesuit students. In 1976, the school began admitting lay theology students (male and female), and these quickly formed the majority of students. In 1986, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, since 13 March 2013 Pope Francis, spent a few months at the Sankt Georgen PTH to consult with professors on a dissertation project, however he has not further pursued the project. The 1993 college church and the 2005 classroom building are both notable works of modern architecture. In 2009 the Institute for Global Church and Mission (IWM) (German: Institut f√ºr Weltkirche und Mission) was founded. In 2010‚Äì2017, IWM students ran the Student Initiative Rahel, which organised the financing of scholarships for disadvantaged young people in Adigrat, northern Ethiopia.

Christians =Non-denominational= ;Bible beater (also \\"Bible basher\\" in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa): A dysphemism for people who believe in the fundamentalist authority of the Bible, particularly those from a Pentecostal or fundamentalist denomination. It is also a slang term for an evangelising Christian. Commonly used universally against Christians who are perceived to go out of their way to energetically preach their faith to others. ; Bible thumper (mainly US and Canada):Someone perceived as aggressively imposing their Christian beliefs upon others. The term derives from preachers thumping their hands down on the Bible, or thumping the Bible itself, to emphasize a point during a sermon. The term's target domain is broad and can often extend to anyone engaged in a public show of religion, fundamentalist or not. The term is most commonly used in English- speaking countries. ; Cafeteria Christian: used by some Christians, and others, to accuse other Christian individuals or denominations of selecting which Christian doctrines they will follow, and which they will not. \\\\- ; Fundie (US):Shortening of fundamentalist. Usually used to mean a Christian fundamentalist. ; God botherer (Australia, UK, New Zealand): Predominantly tagged to a Christian, usually one who openly declares their faith, especially when unwelcome. ; Rice Christian (primarily from East Asian countries): Someone who has formally declared himself/herself a Christian for material benefits rather than for religious reasons. =Protestants= ; Campbellite: a follower of the Churches of Christ, from American Restoration Movement leaders Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell, the latter being one of two key people considered the founders of the movement.The Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary describes the term as \\"sometimes offensive\\".

Entry on \\"Cambellite.\\" ; Holy Roller (US) :an enthusiastic Protestant prone to rolling on the floor, suffering from fits or \\"speaking in tongues\\" (Pentecostals during worship or prayer). The term holy roller, however, is applied to some Evangelical Protestants, especially charismatics, if they are vocal about their own religious views or critical of individuals who do not meet their moral standards. Similar to Bible thumper.\\"roller, n1\\", definition 17b, The Oxford English Dictionary (account required for online access).

Originated as \\"Shaking Quakers\\", in reference to their similarity to Quakers as well as their charismatic worship practices, which involved dancing, shouting, and speaking in tongues. The term was originally derogatory, but very early on was embraced and used by the Shakers themselves. ; Soup-taker (Ireland) :a person who has sold out their beliefs, referring to the Great Famine of Ireland when some Catholics converted to a Protestant faith in order to gain access to a free meal.Hughes, \\"Ireland\\" p. 78 ; Spike: a very High Church Anglican or Anglo-Catholic.The Chambers Dictionary, Edinburgh 1993, p. 1662 =Catholics= ; Left-Footer (especially Ireland and Scotland) :an informal phrase for a Roman Catholic particularly amongst the armed forces in the UK. ; Fenian :a term used to refer to the Fenian Brotherhood and Irish Republican Brotherhood who supported a united Ireland and now used as a sectarian slur by Protestants especially in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Australia. ; Mackerel Snapper: a Roman Catholic; the term originated in the U.S. in the 1850s and refers to the custom of Friday abstinence.The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English p. 1250 (2005 Taylor & Francis) The Friday abstinence from meat (red meat and poultry) distinguishes Catholics from other Christians, especially in North America. ; Mick (Australia; Canada; UK; US) :a Roman Catholic ‚Äî usually Irish Catholic (a reference to the common \\"Mc'\\" patronymic of Irish surnames, or a hypocorism of Michael) ; Papist (Northern Ireland and Scottish Protestants):a Roman Catholic person ‚Äî usually Irish Catholic.Simpson, \\"papist\\" op. cit.; Share, op. cit. p. 237. ; Redneck (Northern English): a Roman Catholic person, nowadays somewhat dated. ; Roman Catholic:a term brought into use by adherents of the Church of England in regard to Branch Theory as well as distaste to the Catholic Church‚Äôs association with the term Catholic.\\"Roman Catholic\\" at Catholic Encyclopedia online. ; Shaveling (archaic) :Usually disparaging: a tonsured clergyman, priest. ; Taig (Northern Ireland Protestants):a Catholic; from tadhg, Irish for \\"Timothy\\".Simpson, \\"teague\\" = Latter Day Saint movement = ; Mormon: a term for a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which was coined by early opposition and put into use by newspapers in Missouri and Illinois who didn't want to refer to the Latter-day Saints as Christians or Saints, and so used a word from one of their books of scripture, The Book of Mormon. Early leaders spoke out against this use of the term due to revelation given about the Church's name, but because of broad use in the press and by locals who opposed the Church, it remained in colloquial use. To this day, many refer to the Church as the \\"Mormon Church,\\" though leaders have been asking to be referred to by their proper name since 1838. However, the term has been used in the sect‚Äôs television advertising. There has been a new effort starting in 2018 to avoid the use of the epithet. There is some disagreement within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints if the term is offensive, or just less preferred. Mormon remains the appropriate term in most historical (Mormon pioneers, Mormon Battalion, Mormon Trail) and demographic contexts, as Mormons are not exclusively members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are many other sects to which the term is not offensive and may be preferred. (List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement) ; Molly Mormon: a term for the stereotype of a \\"perfect\\" female member of LDS Church.Lori G. Beaman, \\"Molly Mormons, Mormon Feminists and Moderates: Religious Diversity and the Latter Day Saints Church \\" \\"Sociology of Religion\\", Vol. 62, No. 1 (Spring 2001), pp. 65‚Äì86 ; Jack Mormon :a non-faithful LDS person or a non-Mormon altogether. Jack Mormon is usually used by non-Mormons to describe Mormons that do not follow the Word of Wisdom (dietary and health practices that exclude the use of tobacco or alcohol) and by Mormons to describe members that do not sufficiently follow practices. It is also used by Mormons to describe those who were Mormon but remain friendly to the Church. It may be applied to ex-Mormons who have repudiated the Church and its teachings but that is a rare usage.Spears (2001), \\"Jack\\" Jews ; Abbie, Abe, and Abie (North America):a Jewish male.

It was discovered by Maria Hitchcock of Armidale NSW near Nambucca in 1986 during the Banksia Atlas project. An attempt to have it accorded subspecies rank was not successful so she named it 'Superman' to describe the giant inflorescences and leaves and in keeping with the common name for Banksia serrata (Saw Banksia). Its leaves and inflorescences are mostly twice the size of typical plants of its parent species, Banksia serrata. Naturally occurring close to running water or on poorly drained sites between Nambucca Heads and Grassy Head in New South Wales, it grows true to seed. It has not yet been introduced into commercial cultivation but seed has been distributed among members of the Australian Plants Society. Specimens have been growing successfully in the Armidale district for more than 15 years and in Canberra. The variety is frost hardy especially when it achieves some height but it is only moderately drought hardy. It has a short warty trunk and thick branches. The upright and terminal inflorescences which occur on short thickened stems off the branches are grey in bud and up to 25 cm x 12 cm in size. The yellow styles emerge in a spiral at the bottom of the inflorescence and gradually cover the whole inflorescence. Lorikeets and other birds are attracted to the nectar. The fruiting cone is covered with dead brown styles and has prominent follicles which contain one or two large seeds with black papery wings separated by a woody spacer. Cones need to be heated in a fire or oven for the follicles to open. The tree drops leaves continually creating a layer of mulch.

It is used by both pleasure craft and small commercial fishing boats. The Ohlone people inhabited the region into much of the 19th century, and a number of recorded shipwrecks occurred in the immediate area. The modern harbor facilities were constructed between 1959 and 1982. The harbor facilities are managed by the San Mateo County Harbor District. Location The harbor is situated at the north end of the semicircular bay called Half Moon Bay, and is at the extreme north edge of the city of Half Moon Bay, the southwest edge of the town of El Granada and the southern edge of the unincorporated community of Princeton-by-the-Sea. The big wave surfing location in Mavericks is about a half mile (1 km) outside Pillar Point Harbor. History =Early history= Before European contact, and through much of the 19th century, the Ohlone tribe lived in the region, especially in the riparian zone of El Granada Creek.Environmental Impact Report for the Pillar Point East Harbor Master Plan, Earth Metrics Inc., San Mateo County Harbor District, February 1989 The National Register of Historic Places indicates an Ohlone archaeological site, Archeological Site SMA-151, in this immediate area. The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, passed through the area on its way north, camping just south of the harbor on October 28, 1769. In his expedition diary, missionary Juan Crespi described Pillar Point. =19th century= By the early 19th century Russian fur trappers plied this portion of the Northern California coast. By 1859 part of the area was owned by James G. Denniston, a California state assemblyman who represented San Mateo County. He built a deep-water landing at Pillar Point which for many years was a key port for lumber, produce and other material destined for San Francisco. Many shipwrecks and other nautical accidents occurred in this area of the Pacific Ocean coastline. The ship Rydal Hall was wrecked in October 1876 near Pillar Point while carrying coal destined for San Francisco. In 1971 the ship's anchor was recovered and is still on display outside a nearby restaurant. =20th century= Aerial view of Pillar Point Harbor looking east. The 1967 breakwater extension is at the center right. The 1982 inner breakwater is at the upper left. In the twentieth century the harbor was used by small fishing boats, though fierce winter storms sometimes destroyed boats even when in the harbor. From 1959 to 1961, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a riprap breakwater to protect the harbor. At that time a pier, the Harbor Master's office, and other facilities were also built, and a foghorn was installed. However it was soon found that the breakwater did not provide protection from southwesterly storm waves, which surged through the breakwater opening. In 1967 the western arm of the breakwater was extended by in an attempt to block such waves. That solution also proved inadequate, so in 1982 an inner breakwater was built. The outer breakwater diverts storm waves to nearby shores, increasing erosion drastically in some places. A line of nearby bluffs eroded back in the 35 years after the breakwater was built, despite an attempt in the 1960s to shield the bluffs with a riprap barrier. The San Mateo County Harbor District has maintained a Harbor Master's Office and rescue station there since 1970. For almost twenty years (1978-1996) the Harbor Master, Robert McMahon and his various crews, achieved recognition from the Coast Guard for being the first responders and saving hundreds of lives.

Unlike most of his contemporaries, he was not interested in opera and, in 1801, instead of going to Italy, he traveled to Paris, where he started a career as a virtuoso pianist. He moved to London in 1810 and became acquainted with liberal circles in that city. During 1822 he returned to Lisbon, and founded there a Philharmonic Society to promote public concerts of contemporary music. After the Portuguese civil war between liberals and absolutists had resulted in a liberal victory, Bomtempo became a music teacher to the young Queen Maria II of Portugal and first Director of the National Conservatory, created in 1835 to replace the old Patriarchal Seminary, which had been abolished by the new liberal regime. Bomtempo composed a vast number of concertos (many of them newly published by Soundpost.org), sonatas, variations and fantasies for the piano. His two known symphonies are the first to be produced by a Portuguese composer. But his largest work, and probably his masterpiece, is his Requiem in memory of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, which has been released on CD.

This is the standard semantics assigned to quantified noun phrases. For example, the generalized quantifier every boy denotes the set of sets of which every boy is a member. :: \\\\\\\\{X \\\\,\\\\, \\\\\\\\{x \\\\,\\\\, \\\\mbox{x is a boy}\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq X \\\\\\\\} This treatment of quantifiers has been essential in achieving a compositional semantics for sentences containing quantifiers. Montague, Richard: 1974, 'The proper treatment of quantification in English', in R. Montague, Formal Philosophy, ed. by R. Thomason (New Haven). Barwise, Jon and Robin Cooper. 1981. Generalized quantifiers and natural language. Linguistics and Philosophy 4: 159-219. Type theory A version of type theory is often used to make the semantics of different kinds of expressions explicit. The standard construction defines the set of types recursively as follows: #e and t are types. #If a and b are both types, then so is \\\\langle a,b\\\\rangle #Nothing is a type, except what can be constructed on the basis of lines 1 and 2 above. Given this definition, we have the simple types e and t, but also a countable infinity of complex types, some of which include: ::\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle;\\\\qquad \\\\langle t,t\\\\rangle;\\\\qquad \\\\langle\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle, t\\\\rangle; \\\\qquad\\\\langle e,\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle\\\\rangle; \\\\qquad \\\\langle\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle,\\\\langle \\\\langle e, t\\\\rangle, t\\\\rangle\\\\rangle;\\\\qquad \\\\ldots *Expressions of type e denote elements of the universe of discourse, the set of entities the discourse is about. This set is usually written as D_e. Examples of type e expressions include John and he. *Expressions of type t denote a truth value, usually rendered as the set\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}, where 0 stands for \\"false\\" and 1 stands for \\"true\\". Examples of expressions that are sometimes said to be of type t are sentences or propositions. *Expressions of type \\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle denote functions from the set of entities to the set of truth values. This set of functions is rendered as D_t^{D_e}. Such functions are characteristic functions of sets. They map every individual that is an element of the set to \\"true\\", and everything else to \\"false.\\" It is common to say that they denote sets rather than characteristic functions, although, strictly speaking, the latter is more accurate. Examples of expressions of this type are predicates, nouns and some kinds of adjectives. *In general, expressions of complex types \\\\langle a,b\\\\rangle denote functions from the set of entities of type a to the set of entities of type b, a construct we can write as follows: D_b^{D_a}. We can now assign types to the words in our sentence above (Every boy sleeps) as follows. **Type(boy)=\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle **Type(sleeps)=\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle **Type(every)= \\\\langle\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle,\\\\langle \\\\langle e, t\\\\rangle, t\\\\rangle\\\\rangle Thus, every denotes a function from a set to a function from a set to a truth value. Put differently, it denotes a function from a set to a set of sets. It is that function which for any two sets A,B, every(A)(B)= 1 if and only if A\\\\subseteq B. Typed lambda calculus A useful way to write complex functions is the lambda calculus. For example, one can write the meaning of sleeps as the following lambda expression, which is a function from an individual x to the proposition that x sleeps. ::\\\\lambda x. sleep'(x) Such lambda terms are functions whose domain is what precedes the period, and whose range are the type of thing that follows the period. If x is a variable that ranges over elements of D_e, then the following lambda term denotes the identity function on individuals: ::\\\\lambda x.x We can now write the meaning of every with the following lambda term, where X,Y are variables of type \\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle: ::\\\\lambda X.\\\\lambda Y. X\\\\subseteq Y If we abbreviate the meaning of boy and sleeps as \\"B\\" and \\"S\\", respectively, we have that the sentence every boy sleeps now means the following: ::(\\\\lambda X.\\\\lambda Y. X\\\\subseteq Y)(B)(S) ‚Äî Œ≤-reduction ::(\\\\lambda Y. B \\\\subseteq Y)(S) ‚Äî Œ≤-reduction ::B\\\\subseteq S The expression every is a determiner. Combined with a noun, it yields a generalized quantifier of type \\\\langle\\\\langle e,t\\\\rangle,t\\\\rangle. Properties =Monotonicity= Monotone increasing GQs A generalized quantifier GQ is said to be monotone increasing, also called upward entailing, just in case, for any two sets X and Y the following holds: ::if X\\\\subseteq Y, then GQ(X) entails GQ(Y). The GQ every boy is monotone increasing. For example, the set of things that run fast is a subset of the set of things that run. Therefore, the first sentence below entails the second: #Every boy runs fast. #Every boy runs. Monotone decreasing GQs A GQ is said to be monotone decreasing, also called downward entailing just in case, for any two sets X and Y, the following holds: ::If X\\\\subseteq Y, then GQ(Y) entails GQ(X). An example of a monotone decreasing GQ is no boy. For this GQ we have that the first sentence below entails the second. #No boy runs. #No boy runs fast. The lambda term for the determiner no is the following. It says that the two sets have an empty intersection. ::\\\\lambda X.\\\\lambda Y. X\\\\cap Y= \\\\emptyset Monotone decreasing GQs are among the expressions that can license a negative polarity item, such as any. Monotone increasing GQs do not license negative polarity items. #Good: No boy has any money. #Bad: *Every boy has any money. Non-monotone GQs A GQ is said to be non-monotone if it is neither monotone increasing nor monotone decreasing. An example of such a GQ is exactly three boys. Neither of the following two sentences entail the other. #Exactly three students ran. #Exactly three students ran fast. The first sentence doesn't entail the second. The fact that the number of students that ran is exactly three doesn't entail that each of these students ran fast, so the number of students that did that can be smaller than 3. Conversely, the second sentence doesn't entail the first. The sentence exactly three students ran fast can be true, even though the number of students who merely ran (i.e. not so fast) is greater than 3. The lambda term for the (complex) determiner exactly three is the following. It says that the cardinality of the intersection between the two sets equals 3. ::\\\\lambda X.\\\\lambda Y. X\\\\cap Y=3 =Conservativity= A determiner D is said to be conservative if the following equivalence holds: ::D(A)(B)\\\\leftrightarrow D(A)(A\\\\cap B) For example, the following two sentences are equivalent. #Every boy sleeps. #Every boy is a boy who sleeps. It has been proposed that all natural language determiners (i.e. in every language) are conservative (Barwise and Cooper 1981). The expression only is not conservative. The following two sentences are not equivalent. But it is, in fact not common to analyze only as a determiner. Rather, it is standardly treated as a focus-sensitive adverb. #Only boys sleep. #Only boys are boys who sleep.

It is frequently lethal in the neonatal period due to respiratory insufficiency, but the severity of the disease is variable, and some patients survive into adulthood. The name is derived from the Greek roots campo (or campto), meaning bent, and melia, meaning limb. An unusual aspect of the disease is that up to two-thirds of affected 46,XY genotypic males display a range of disorders of sexual development (DSD) and genital ambiguities or may even develop as normal phenotypic females as in complete 46 XY sex reversal. An atypical form of the disease with absence of bowed limbs is called, prosaically, acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (ACD) and is found in about 10% of patients, particularly those surviving the neonatal period.  Signs and symptoms  While the definitive presentation of the disease is a patient having bowed lower limbs and sex reversal in 46,XY males, there are other clinical criteria that can be used, absent these characteristics, to make the diagnosis. Patients may present with underdeveloped shoulder blades, shortened and angulated lower limbs, a vertically oriented and narrow pelvis, an enlarged head, an undersized jaw, cleft palate, flat nasal bridge, low set ears, club feet, dislocated hips, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, or bone abnormalities in the neck and spine. Respiratory distress can be caused by an underdeveloped trachea which collapses on inhalation or by insufficient rib cage development. Genetics  CMD is caused by chromosomal abnormalities, generally spontaneously arising or de novo mutations, in or around the gene SOX9 on the long arm of chromosome 17, specifically at position 17q24. The SOX9 gene codes for a protein transcription factor which, when expressed at the embryonic stage, plays an important role in determining sexual characteristics and greatly influences skeletal development. When the SRY gene of the Y chromosome is expressed in human embryos, a cascade of gene interactions controlled by SOX9 begins and ultimately leads to male gender. Numerous mutations have been identified involving the SOX9 gene that cause some form of CMD. Any mutation within the coding region of SOX9 can cause campomelic dysplasia and 75% of the reported mutations lead to sex reversal. Four major classes of heterozygous SOX9 mutations can cause CMD: amino acid substitutions in the HMG-box, truncations or frameshifts that alter the C-terminal end, mutations at the splice junction, and chromosomal translocations. Additionally, mutations upstream from SOX9 can also cause CMD. Several researchers have reported cis- acting control elements upstream of SOX9. Translocation breakpoints scattered over 1Mb proximal to SOX9 indicate the presence of an extended control region. The lack of correlation between specific genetic mutations and observed phenotype, particularly with regard to sex reversal, give clear evidence of the variable expressivity of the disease. Milder forms of the disease, seen in those who live beyond the neonatal period and those with ACD, may be attributable to somatic mosaicism‚Äîparticularly for those with mutations within the SOX9 coding region. Chromosomal aberrations in the upstream control regions or residual activity of the mutant SOX9 protein could also be responsible for the milder forms of the disease. Long-term survivors of CMD are significantly more likely to have translocation and inversion mutations upstream of SOX9 rather than mutations in the SOX9 coding region itself. Diagnosis In utero sonographic diagnosis is possible when characteristic features such as bilateral bowed femurs and tibia, clubbed feet, prominent curvature of the neck, a bell-shaped chest, pelvic dilation, and/or an undersized jaw are apparent. Radiographic techniques are generally used only postnatally and also rely on prototypical physical characteristics. =Screening= Genetic screening is also typically done postnatally, including PCR typing of microsatellite DNA and STS markers as well as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies using DNA microarrays. In some cases PCR and sequencing of the entire SOX9 gene is used to diagnose CMD. Many different translocation breakpoints and related chromosomal aberrations in patients with CMD have been identified. Prognosis In nearly 95% of the cases, death occurs in the neonatal period due to respiratory distress, generally related to small chest size or insufficient development of the trachea and other upper airway structures. Among survivors of CMD, the skeletal malformations change over time to include worsening scoliosis or kyphosis resulting in decreased trunk size relative to the limb length. Neurological damage is also often seen including mental retardation and deafness. Even among survivors of the prenatal period, CMD patients have shortened life spans due to lifelong respiratory issues. Those patients with ambiguous genitalia or sex reversal at birth, of course, maintain that state, and are either sterile or have reduced fertility. Epidemiology Campomelic dysplasia has a reported incidence of 0.05-0.09 per 10000 live births.

Bach 'Bourree in E minor' (BWV 996) Bourr√©e in E minor is a popular lute piece, the fifth movement from Suite in E minor for Lute, BWV 996 (BC L166) written by Johann Sebastian Bach. The piece is arguably one of the most famous among guitarists. A bourr√©e was a type of dance that originated in France with quick duple meter and an upbeat. Though the bourr√©e was popular as a social dance and shown in theatrical ballets during the reign of Louis XIV of France, the Bourr√©e in E minor was not intended for dancing. Nonetheless, some of the elements of the dance are incorporated in the piece. Bach wrote his lute pieces in a traditional score rather than in lute tablature, and some believe that Bach played his lute pieces on the keyboard. No original script of the Suite in E minor for Lute by Bach is known to exist. However, in the collection of one of Bach's pupils, Johann Ludwig Krebs, there is one piece (\\"Praeludio - con la Suite da Gio: Bast. Bach\\") that has written \\"aufs Lauten Werck\\" (\\"for the lute-harpsichord\\") in unidentified handwriting. Some argue that despite this reference, the piece was meant to be played on the lute as demonstrated by the texture. Others argue that since the piece was written in E minor, it would be incompatible with the baroque lute which was tuned to D minor. Nevertheless, it may be played with other string instruments, such as the guitar, mandola or mandocello, and keyboard instruments, and it is especially well-known among guitarists. The tempo of the piece is fairly quick and smooth. It also demonstrates counterpoint, as the two voices move independently of one another. Furthermore, the Bourr√©e in E minor demonstrates binary form. In classical music Robert Schumann quotes the first 14 notes of this memorable theme (transposed to G minor) in #3 of the Op. 60, 6 Fugues on B‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìH, where he neatly combines it with the B A C B motif. There also appears to be an echo of this reference in the next fugue, #4. Jethro Tull version Jethro Tull used the first part (first eight bars) of the piece in the third track in their August 1969 album Stand Up, \\"Bour√©e\\",Jethro Tull, Scott Allen Nollen, Ian Anderson (McFarland, 2001) Page 47 which was also released as a single that year. Alternative versions of the same track appear on The Jethro Tull Christmas Album, A Little Light Music and the 25th Anniversary Box Set and is a band favorite for live concerts. In April 2011, a portion of this was also played as a duet by Cady Coleman from the ISS and Ian Anderson on tour in Perm, Russia. In popular culture The piece has been used by a number of musicians: *Paul McCartney has said in interviews and on tours that the songs \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Jenny Wren\\" were both inspired by variations and alterations to the bourr√©e. *The London Blues-rock group Bakerloo released their arrangement of the tune, titled \\"Drivin' Bachwards\\", as a single on Harvest Records (HAR 5004) in July 1969.

L. Qioniwailevu and Adi Veniana Draukibei. Ro Waisea was the \\"Vunivalu na Vosaibaleni\\" of the Yavusa Nawainovo from the tokatoka Nauluvatu. Adi Elenoa was the last member of this lineage. Before she died in 1930, she held the title \\"Vunivalu na Vosaibaleni\\", inheriting it from her father. She was also the last person to have been installed to this position. Her village was Kasavu, now located in the province and district of Naitasiri. Formerly, this village consisted of three tribes, including the Yavusa Nawainovo, where the \\"Marama na Vunivalu\\" is from, and which comprises the Mataqali Vunivesi. The other two tribes were the Yavusa Sawa, consisting of the Mataqali Rokoraite, and the Yavusa Burenitu, consisting of the Mataqali Aisokula, Rokotuinakoro, Vunileba, Tabuicovi and Naisogo. However, after the sitting of the Native Lands Commission the three tribes were combined into one known as the Burenitu tribe. Adi Elenoa married the \\"Gone Toga\\" of Rewa, Senitiki Tupou, who was the first Fijian magistrate. They met while the Gone Toga was posted to Naduruloulou, in Kasavu. The Gone Toga was from the Mataqali Vusamatai of the Yavusa Nailarube.He is the son of Ratu Manoa Nagatalevu, the Turaga na Gone Toga and Adi Ana Lelea. He died while serving his judicial duties in Vunidawa and was laid to rest at Namotobau, Seatura, in the District of Rara, Naitasiri. The title of the \\"Marama na Vosaibaleni\\" originated from Ucunivanua in Verata. The title was said to be the twin title of the \\"Ratu mai Verata\\". The Vosaibaleni is name of the twin brother of the Ratu, who, according to Fijian tradition, took the form of a snake upon birth, hence the title Vunivalu na Vosaibaleni. Since her death in 1930, no-one has been installed into the position, even though the \\"Turaga ni Yavusa Burenitu\\" now performs the function of this title. The main reason why the position has been vacant ever since her death was because Adi Elenoa was born into a family of one. She did not have any other siblings and that all her children were registered in the Vola ni Kawabula of Nailarube. The structure of her village changed much after the sitting of the Native Lands Commission.  References  Orr.

The range is based on factors like location (high vs low cost of living locations), experience, or seniority. Pay bands (sometimes also used as a broader term that encompasses several pay levels, ranges or grades) is a part of an organized salary compensation plan, program or system. In an organization that has defined jobs, pay bands are used to distinguish the level of compensation given to certain ranges of jobs to have fewer levels of pay, alternative career tracks other than management, and barriers to hierarchy to motivate unconventional career moves. For example, entry-level positions at a landscaping company might include truck drivers and laborers. Those jobs and those of similar levels of responsibility might all be included in a named or numbered pay band that prescribed a range of pay, (e.g. Band 1 = $10‚Äì$17 per hour). The next level/classification of a group of similar jobs would include increased responsibility, and thus a higher pay band (e.g. Band 2 = $13‚Äì$21 per hour). Organizing pay structures in a pay band manner allows for overall control at the management level of an organization, while still giving some discretion for supervisors to reward good performance, and keeping within a reasonable compensation budget structure.  History  The history of Pay Bands dates back to the beginning of employment and compensation. The amount of compensation for one's work is a question that many have tried to answer but have come short. The Classification Act of 1923 mandated that pay was based on performance not qualifications, a practice that made sense when the workforce was largely clerical. However, by the 1950s managers were complaining that the system was problematic for reasons of no competition, frustration and non responsive. In April 2000, the United States General Accounting Office authorized Section 9509 which authorized the general workforce classification and pay. In detail, the term \\"broad-banded pay system\\" was clearly defined as any system for grouping positions for pay, job evaluation, and other purposes that is different from the system established under chapters 51 and 53 of title 5 as a result of combining grades and related ranges of pay into one or more occupational series. = Other Types of Pay Structures =  Traditional structure  Organizations are looking for a pay system for rewarding with compensation and also working well within that organization. In the traditional structure there is a difference between employee and manager with an example of pay according to their position. To get a high pay, there needs to be movement up the hierarchical ladder. Moving up the ladder to a manager position will change the pay range is a traditional pay structure but, \\"this system fosters competition rather than collaboration.\\"  Pay for Performance  Although the Pay-for-Performance System is \\"widely used\\" for its \\"positive effects\\" on employee production, findings of negative side effects like \\"dysfunctional competition\\" have left employers wondering if this plan should be adopted. Their reasoning in keeping this system in place is related to the need for \\"fair managerial control\\", a battle many managers are striving to win. Broadbanding Structure Broad banding uses the General Schedule that places families of occupations together. For example, Office Services, General Support, Analysis, Law Enforcement, Sciences, Health, etc. Movement to a different level is based on full-performance, expertise, or years of working in this position. This structure is used to classify work requirements rather than positions to get a higher pay. Process of Changing a Pay Band There are two ways an employees pay band can be changed. If the job description correlates with the national profile for said job then their transition will go relatively smoothly. However, for more complex or newer jobs that do not have a national profile, their process becomes increasingly difficult. In some cases employees are required to fill out large amounts of paperwork and go to a formal job evaluation panel to discuss their positions responsibilities. This also means that once an employee goes through the process and gets placed in a new pay band, others in similar positions will likely be grouped together in the same pay band. Occupations Using Pay Ranges =Nurses= When a new type of nurse was introduced in 2005 called a \\"Matron\\" nurse, the Royal College of Nurses, Community Practitioners and Health Visitors' Association (CPHVA) both agreed on what their pay band should be. However, current nurses who were still stuck on an older pay band felt that this was neglecting their right to a raise and left them on the back burner. Despite district nurses concerns, the CPHVA continued with their plans on placing matron nurses on a higher pay band due to their large range of skills and complex responsibilities. Parish says in his portion of the Nursing Journal that \\"We will be looking for something that is a significant inducement to new recruits, one that will ensure qualified staff stay in the professions.\\" Parish goes on to show that many of the nurses coming out of school choose to go into departments that are well compensated. This leaves portions of the nursing departments in hospitals all around the country with a shortage of employees in specialty departments like learning disability. These places that nurses are understaffed are a real problem Parish, one that needs to be fixed to ensure the quality of work in their area of concern. One of the ways to ensure the recruitment of nurses in fields that are understaffed is to raise the compensation of the job to be more competitive with the other subfields of nursing. NHS managers who receive very high salaries may have been manipulating their job evaluations to receive these high wages. NHS was asked by unions to re-evaluate the salaries of many top execs. RCN's Head of employment relations, Josie Owen, acknowledges that a \\"group of staff in the NHS has overplayed certain factors to get higher grades.\\" =Teachers= According to the School Leadership Today article, \\"Freedom in Teacher Performance Pay\\", teachers in America are one of the most underpaid and segregated fields. The editorial suggests that \\"It is vital that teachers can be paid more without having to leave the classroom. This will be particularly important to schools in the most disadvantaged areas as it will empower them to attract and recruit the best teachers.\\" Oftentimes teachers that want to be paid more are pushed into primary and secondary administration, opposed to being chairs of departments like advanced educational opportunities like colleges. This causes teachers to be in rotation and can lead to many shortages of quality teachers actually in the classroom. The academic journal suggests that we should rely on a different pay band policy to keep teachers in the classroom to ensure quality of education while paying via performance of the teachers as well. It is important to note, that paying for performance does not entail: how many students pas the standardized tests, move to the next grade; but rather a secondary tool of employee evaluation. =Bankers= The Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee wants the Financial Services Authority to reveal the salary of bankers in Britain. This move is designed to break the deadlock on city remuneration. Andrew Tyrie is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, demands Sir David Walker's idea of bankers who receive over 1 million euro annually should have their wages reveal to the public. Bankers fear this will affect competitiveness within their industry. Andrew Tyrie assures that his plan can answer any question about competitiveness. Examples of employers using the pay band method of compensation include: *the Commonwealth of Virginia,Salary Structure Effective 11/25/07 *Cornell University in New York,Office of Human Resources: Compensation: Pay Band Minimums *the state of South CarolinaOffice of Human Resources - State of South Carolina Pay Bands and *MIT.HR @ MIT - Compensation Workers View Corporation like Northern Telecom, General Electric, and Data General have adopted pay bands to promote teaming and lateral development to take away from hierarchical movement within the workplace. The issues employees have with pay bands is that it restricts promotions in the organizations leading them to look at opportunities out of their organization to move up to another pay range. Also, since pay bands motivates employees to move laterally, some question the purpose of another position that is still going to be with the same pay band.
