He is the only horse to break the 130 Beyer Speed Figure, accomplishing that milestone in his first two starts of 1987. In the Roseben Handicap at Belmont Racetrack, he earned a 131 rating, which he followed up with a 134 in the True North Handicap. Bred in Texas by Marshall T. Robinson, Groovy was out of the mare Tinnitus and sired by 1976 Canadian Horse of the Year Norcliffe, who was a son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Buckpasser. Groovy was purchased at auction in February 1985 for $81,000 by Edith Libutti, the daughter of agent Ralph Libutti. Two months later, she sold the colt to New Jersey banker Theodore V. Kruckel. Racing at age two Groovy was handled by several trainers during his race conditioning period and his first season of racing. Trainer Jack Adams believed that the horse could not successfully compete at distances of more than seven furlongs, but Groovy's owner dreamed of running in the mile and a quarter Kentucky Derby and replaced Adams. Kimberly Hardy saddled the colt in his racing debut on September 2, 1985, and won the Forever Casting Stakes at Meadowlands Racetrack at a distance of six furlongs. With Adams back as trainer, Groovy raced four more times that year, with his best results coming at Belmont Park, where he ran second in both the Grade I Champagne Stakes (9¬æ lengths behind winner Mogambo) and the Futurity Stakes. In each of these races Groovy took the lead from the start and tired badly. Racing at age three Making his 1986 debut at Florida's Gulfstream Park on January 8, 1986, Groovy won the Spectacular Bid Stakes at six furlongs. Before his next start, Houston, Texas, real estate developer John Ballis paid $1 million for a half-interest in the horse. Groovy was then shipped from Florida to New York. There, under Petro Peters, his sixth trainer, he lost three straight races but ran third in the Wood Memorial Invitational Stakes. Triple Crown Trainer Peters was replaced by Howard Crowell, and Groovy's owners sent him to run in the Kentucky Derby. In that race, the colt immediately took the lead and held it for the first three- quarters of a mile before tiring badly and finishing sixteenth and last, 49 lengths behind winner Ferdinand. However, his owners entered him in the mile and three-sixteenths Preakness Stakes. Once again, the distance was too much and Groovy finished sixth in a seven-horse field. He did not run him in the mile and a half Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series. Eighth and last trainer In June 1986, a month after the Preakness, Groovy's owners turned his race conditioning over to Jose Martin, who had trained Lakeville Miss, the American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly of 1977, as well as Wayward Lass, the 1981 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. Martin accepted the job on the understanding that he would decide which races the colt competed in. Martin entered Groovy in the July 4 Firecracker Stakes, a six-furlong sprint at Belmont Park, which he won by 2¬æ lengths. On July 20, Groovy won the seven-furlong Tom Fool Handicap, a Grade II event at Belmont Park. He followed this up with another Grade II win in the seven-furlong Forego Handicap at Saratoga Race Course. Stretched to one mile (8 furlongs) in the Jerome Handicap, Groovy finished fourth. Now firmly fixed as a sprint horse, he was shipped to California to prepare for the November 1, 1986, Breeders' Cup Sprint. In a tune-up on October 15, he won the six-furlong Ancient Title Handicap at Santa Anita Park in the time of 1:08 1/5. On the same track and at the same distance, Groovy was sent off as the overwhelming favorite to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint but finished fourth, 2¬Ω lengths behind winner Smile. Following another fourth-place finish in the November 15 Sport Page Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack, X-rays revealed that Groovy had a bone chip in the right knee that required surgery. Four-year-old season At the end of Groovy's 1986 racing campaign, John Ballis bought out his partner's half-interest in the horse for $950,000 and raced under the name Lone Star Stable. Recovery from surgery saw Groovy out of racing for nearly seven months. He returned on June 6, 1987, to win the Roseben Handicap at Belmont Park by 4¬æ lengths, receiving a Beyer Speed Figure of 131. In the June 21 True North Handicap at Belmont Park, while carrying high weight, Groovy established a track record of 1:07 4/5 for six furlongs on dirt and earned a Beyer Speed figure of 134 on a muddy track. He then won the July 5 Breeders' Cup Stakes at Farmington, New York's Finger Lakes Race Track, setting another track record for six furlongs on dirt with a time of 1:09 2/5. After he won the July 18 Tom Fool Handicap for the second year in a row and his fourth race in four 1987 starts, John Ballis sold Groovy for $4 million to the Prestonwood Farm of brothers Jack, Art and J.R. Preston. For his new owners, Groovy won his next two starts, including the Grade I Vosburgh Stakes on October 10. Undefeated for the year, Groovy was again the heavy favorite to win November's Breeders' Cup Sprint, hosted in 1987 by Hollywood Park Racetrack. In his last race, for the second straight year Groovy was upset in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, finishing second by four lengths to the filly Very Subtle. Groovy was a leading contender for American Horse of the Year honors, and this loss may have cost him the title. However, he was voted the Eclipse Award as the 1987 American Champion Sprint Horse. As a sire Groovy stood at stud at Prestonwood Farm in Kentucky for eleven seasons and two more for the farm's new owners, who operate as WinStar Farm. He sired more than 220 winners, of which 18 were stakes winners. The top earner among his progeny at $636,664 was Brutally Frank (b. 1994), whose wins included the Grade 1 Carter Handicap. Groovy was pensioned in 2001 due to neurological issues. On January 26, 2006, at age twenty-three, he was humanely euthanized at WinStar Farms due to infirmities of old age.

It is composed of the Grammar School (K-6) and the Upper School (grades 7-12).  Location  New Covenant Christian School is located at 128 Saint Mary‚Äôs Church Road in Abingdon, Maryland. (This is also the address of New Covenant Presbyterian Church, although the school has its own wing of the building.) NCCS is a ministry of New Covenant Presbyterian Church (NCPC).  School Identity  The mascot of the school is the New Covenant Knight. The school colors are burgundy and navy blue. A motto among the teachers and staff is \\"Sharpening minds, shepherding hearts, shaping lives.\\" The mission statement of New Covenant Christian School is: \\"We exist to glorify God by assisting parents in training their children to be Biblically-minded servant-leaders through a Reformed, Christ-centered, classical education.\\"New Covenant Christian School website, About, What We Believe Student Body Although the school is a ministry of New Covenant Presbyterian Church, it includes students from many different churches and faith backgrounds. House System A house system was instated in the Upper School in September 2011. Students are assigned to four houses, all named after influential historical figures: Athanasius House, Augustine House, Calvin House, and Luther House. Each house is led by a student who serves as the House Captain. It is the Captain‚Äôs job to manage house operations along with other house officers. The Captains and Delegates make up the Student Leadership Council (SLC), which works with faculty and administration to plan, organize, and manage many Upper School activities, such as social events, service projects, and competitions.  History  The school was founded in 1999. At the start, only kindergarten and first grade were offered. In the following years, NCCS added one grade level until the school celebrated its first graduating class in 2010. The school follows the classical model of education which is based on the structures of ancient and medieval education systems. Under this model, students progress through the trivium: grammar, logic, and rhetoric stages.  Methodology  In kindergarten through sixth, the students progress through the grammar stage. During these years, a child's brain develops in such a way that he or she is able to easily memorize information. Lessons include instruction in the basics of grammar, phonics, mathematics, land formations, countries and capitals, names and dates of important people and events in history, and English and Latin vocabulary. Grades seven through nine make up the logic phase (or dialectic phase). During these years, students naturally begin to question the world around them. The lessons in the logic years focus on reasoning skills: identifying relationships between facts and ideas, discerning fact from fallacy, etc. Essentially, the learning of facts continues from the grammar years and analytical skills are added to those facts. The rhetoric phase is completed in grades ten through twelve. This phase is all about application. Students make practical use of the knowledge and skills they acquired in the grammar and logic phases. They are taught to creatively, eloquently, and effectively express themselves in writing and speech. There is also significant focus on debate in this phase.

The programme comprises long-form films, investigating and exploring domestic and foreign topics. Episodes are produced both by independent production companies and in-house by ITV Studios. The average budget for a single edition is between ¬£150,000 and ¬£200,000. The series was commissioned by Peter Fincham, ITV's Director of Television, and is a sister show to year-round current affairs strand Tonight. It made its debut on Monday 26 September 2011 ‚Äì airing at 22.40, directly after ITV News at Ten. Since its launch, the programme has usually occupied this near-peak slot, but has also been shown as late as 23.10. On 3 March 2015, it made its only appearance to date in primetime, airing at 21.00. The series was broadcast on Mondays in 2011 and Wednesdays in 2012. The 2013 series was billed as an eight-episode run (the longest to date), with five of the editions airing on consecutive Thursdays in their traditional autumn slots and the remaining three being broadcast as standalone episodes between February and July 2014. In January 2014 it was announced that ITV would no longer air episodes in a series block, instead spreading them throughout the year. Independent producers expressed concern that this would result in fewer editions, but ITV said the changes allowed for a more flexible approach regarding delivery deadlines, which are often complicated by the need for legal clearance before broadcast. The three standalone editions aired in early-mid 2014 as part of series 3 from 2013 effectively meant that there was no 2014 series of the strand. The programme began its first non-series run in January 2015. Promotional trailers for individual editions are rare, but the strand itself featured in a promo for ITV's news and current affairs coverage (along with ITV News, Tonight and The Agenda) in late 2012. Series 1 =Episode 1= *Gaddafi and the IRA (Broadcast 26 September 2011) Colonel Gadaffi gave the IRA enough weapons to turn a militia into an army. Exposure's first film examines his support for the Republicans and investigates the continuing danger of his legacy. Narrated by Paul McGann. In this episode, ITV mistakenly presented footage taken from the game ArmA 2 as footage of a 1988 IRA attack. The broadcaster apologised, blaming human error. A spokesperson for ITV commented on the error and said: > \\"The events featured in Exposure: Gaddafi and the IRA were genuine but it > would appear that during the editing process the correct clip of the 1988 > incident was not selected and other footage was mistakenly included in the > film by producers. This was an unfortunate case of human error for which we > apologise.\\" =Episode 2= *The Factory Focusing on a city in Europe where the pollution is so bad, children struggle to breathe, DNA is damaged, and the vulnerable are forced indoors. This programme investigates the role played by a global multi-national. =Episode 3= *Heart Hospital =Episode 4= *The World's Deadliest Arms Race =Episode 5= *On the Run Mark Williams-Thomas investigates =Episode 6= *Heart Hospital Series 2 =Episode 1= *The British Way of Death (broadcast 26 September 2012) Undercover investigation which reveals disrespectful behaviour by British funeral directors. =Episode 2= *The Other Side of Jimmy Savile (broadcast 3 October 2012) Former police officer Mark Williams-Thomas investigates claims of sexual abuse of underage girls against the charity fundraiser and television presenter Jimmy Savile. Five women (two of whom waived their right to anonymity) all allege that they were assaulted or raped by the entertainer. The programme was born out of an aborted investigation by the BBC's Newsnight in late 2011, on which Williams- Thomas had worked as a consultant, with reporter Liz MacKean and producer Meirion Jones. Williams-Thomas took a leading role in the programme, having pitched a proposal to ITV after the BBC dropped the Newsnight investigation; he has praised MacKean and Jones for allowing him to do so. He says he researched the piece as if he were running a police investigation and admits that he was worried that both he and the programme-makers would be heavily criticised if other alleged victims hadn't come forward in the wake of the broadcast. Producers and ITV News bosses agreed that the edition would be broadcast only if it could have been shown had Savile still been alive. The testimony of those making allegations against Savile was only included if their contact with him could be established by a photograph or other supporting evidence. The piece came within the usual budget for Exposure, costing around ¬£170,000 for the ten-month investigation. It was broadcast in a later-than-usual timeslot of 23.15, but still attracted 2.5 million viewers (including time-shifted viewing) and a 23% audience share. The edition won Royal Television Society awards in 2013 in the Current Affairs (Home) and Scoop of the Year categories. It was also given a Peabody Award in 2012.72nd Annual Peabody Awards, May 2013. The programme gave ITV News a platform for extensive follow-up reports on the subject, which resulted in ITN winning the News Coverage (Home) category in the RTS awards in 2013. Although it would become the highest profile edition of the programme to date, this episode was broadcast at the later-than-usual time of 23.10. =Episode 3= *No bribes please! We're British (broadcast 10 October 2012) =Episode 4= *Driven From Home (broadcast 17 October 2012) Residents forced out of an estate blighted by violence =Episode 5= *Who cares in Britain's care homes?

The programme features footage from a police interview with Banaz, who says she is being followed by members of the Kurdish community from which she originates, having walked out on an abusive forced marriage and pursued a relationship with another man. The programme is a shorter version of the film Banaz: A Love Story, produced by Fuuse Films created in collaboration with Hardcash Productions for Exposure. Banaz won a Peabody Award and International Emmy Award in 2013, but lost out to another Exposure film, The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, at the Royal Television Society Journalism Awards in 2013. In view of the programme's content, a warning about \\"graphic discussion of rape and murder\\" was aired in the continuity announcement at the start of this edition; unusually, this warning was repeated after the first commercial break before the programme continued. =Episode 7= *Exposure Update: The Jimmy Savile Investigation (broadcast 21 November 2012) Mark Williams-Thomas revisits his investigation into the disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile, which dominated the news agenda in the weeks after it was broadcast. Set against a backdrop of the criminal and institutional investigations which had been launched in the intervening seven weeks, this programme hears testimony from more alleged victims and explores how Savile ingratiated himself with politicians and royalty. It also considers the question of how Savile was able to gain widespread access and power within NHS institutions, in spite of being unqualified for any of the roles which he purportedly fulfilled there. The programme considers why charges were not brought against Savile after he was interviewed by Surrey Police in 2009; Williams-Thomas declares \\"for the record\\" during this segment of the programme that he used to work for the force. Series 3 =Episode 1= *Predators Abroad (broadcast 2 October 2013) Mark Williams-Thomas investigates new concerns over British paedophiles in Cambodia. =Episode 2= *Forced to Marry (broadcast 9 October 2013) UK imams agree to perform underage marriages. =Episode 3= *Britain's booming cannabis business (broadcast 16 October 2013) Conor Woodman investigates the shift in the UK cannabis industry from commercial to home-grown production and reveals how this move towards small domestic units can result in growers encountering the kind of violent criminals whom they had tried to avoid by growing their own supply. The programme explores the extent of cannabis cultivation in the UK and shows how major dealers are generating their profits by operating multiple small-scale sites. =Episode 4= *Undercover Colleges (broadcast 23 October 2013) An undercover investigation into the recruiting practices, administration and facilities at the Academy de London and London School of Business and Finance =Episode 5= *Too Late to Save Your Life (broadcast 30 October 2013) An investigation into the effectiveness of the UK's cancer screening programme, exploring how some testing regimes have better early diagnosis and detection rates than others. =Episode 6= *Fashion Factories Undercover (broadcast 6 February 2014) An investigation uncovers pressures, abuse and violence - as well as locked fire doors and lies about health and safety - behind the closed doors of Dhaka's sweatshops. Presented by Laura Kuenssberg, who had provided extensive coverage in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza factory disaster in April 2013 as ITV News Business Editor. This programme was broadcast shortly after Kuenssberg had departed ITN to rejoin the BBC, but she made appearances on ITV News bulletins throughout the day, trailing the edition. It was the first standalone edition in what had been billed as an eight-episode run when the series returned in autumn 2013. This edition was produced by Hardcash Productions. =Episode 7= *Inside the Diplomatic Bag (broadcast 26 April 2014) Mark Williams-Thomas investigates how privileges for foreign diplomats based in the UK are open to abuse. Issues explored include diplomatic immunity and the protected status of the so-called 'diplomatic bag' for moving items into and out of the country. The programme centres around a sting on a member of the Nigerian High Commission, who claims he can smuggle stolen goods out of the UK, but is later revealed not to have diplomatic status. =Episode 8= *Don't Take My Child (broadcast 15 July 2014) Exploring the issue of forced adoption and considering whether the power is being used too readily in the wake of several high-profile child protection scandals. Narrated by ITV News presenter Nina Hossain. Another standalone edition; the last episode in the 2013/14 series. Occasional episodes *Britain's Secret Slaves (broadcast 22 January 2015) ITV News presenter Julie Etchingham fronts an investigation into forced domestic servitude. The programme includes interviews with those who have experienced modern-day slavery after being brought to the UK. It also considers how changes to visa rules, designed to toughen the immigration system, could be responsible for trapping victims in slave-like conditions and features an undercover sting on a recruitment agency which promises non- existent jobs to foreign domestic workers in return for a fee. The culmination of the sting sees a producer on the programme confront the woman who had been secretly filmed. The lack of pictures resulting from the need to obscure identities and provide an appropriate visual accompaniment to disturbing cases studies is addressed with the use of still drawings of the situations under discussion. This edition was produced by Hardcash Productions. *The Kill List (broadcast 11 February 2015) This edition reveals how real-time information from mobile phones was used by coalition forces to target suspected insurgents during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the height of the military action, up to a dozen addresses were raided per night in an effort to capture or kill the individuals concerned. Some senior military figures involved in the operations defend their use and effectiveness, while other analysts suggest they hampered efforts to negotiate an end to the conflicts - perhaps even improving the gene pool of insurgent fighters, making them more difficult to defeat militarily. The programme is narrated by former Parachute Regiment commander Sean Rayment and produced by Brook Lapping Productions. *Charities Behaving Badly (broadcast 18 February 2015) An investigation into charities alleged to be promoting extremist views, including white supremacy, anti- semitism and jihad. ITV News presenter Mark Austin presents and also conducts several interviews, including one in which the Charities Commission admits it does not have the power to close charities for the reasons highlighted by the programme. *When Pregnant Women Drink (broadcast 3 March 2015) This edition explores a condition known as Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, which can affect the offspring of women who consume alcohol during pregnancy. It focuses on the apparently contradictory advice given to pregnant women in the UK about a 'safe level' of alcohol intake. The programme features several sufferers of FASD and follows the progress of one child with severe behavioural and developmental problems whose adoptive parents are seeking a definitive diagnosis. They are given access to advanced facial profiling techniques which aid in confirming the condition. Research is revealed from the United States which claims an analysis of various studies shows alcohol to be a greater risk factor to unborn babies than heroin. Good Morning Britain and ITV News presenter Ranvir Singh presents and takes on an active reporter role, conducting the majority of interviews, including a combative encounter with a consultant obstetrician. This edition aired in peaktime at 21.00, the only occasion to date on which the strand has done so.

During the 1943-1944 term of office, incumbent alderman William MacFarland died suddenly, prompting council to appoint Frederick Slack, the runner-up in the previous year's election, to MacFarland's seat. Slack campaigned heavily on his incumbency and referred to himself as a \\"people's candidate\\" during the campaign.\\"Action-Sincerity- People's Candidate\\" Hamilton Spectator, Saturday, December 2, 1944, pg. 22. Despite his brief tenure in office, Slack was soundly defeated, with electors returning Parker and his fellow alderman Herbert Hannah to office.\\"Electors return most members of 1944 council,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Tuesday, December 5, 1944, pg. 11. One of the area's prominent organizers with the Liberal Party, Henry Arnott Hicks, made his first bid for public office in this election. The 37-year-old Hicks was ultimately unsuccessful, falling over 700 votes behind Hannah. Despite his close ties with the Liberals, Hicks campaigned as an independent. The central theme of his campaign literature, aimed at his CCF opponent, declared that \\"civic affairs should be free of politics.\\"\\"Vote H.

The local CCF candidate, Arthur Cole, did little campaigning in local media and was not considered likely to win the seat from either of the two incumbents. =Ward Three (Durand-Kirkendall-Ainslie Wood)= =Ward Four (Westdale- Strathcona)= Ward Four in the city's north-west, featured a battle between two prominent members of Hamilton's Liberal establishment and three diverse challengers. Aldermen Peter McCulloch, who was first elected in 1935, and two- term alderman Thomas Marshall fended off challenges from independent candidate Arthur Vickers and two distinct labour candidates. Running as an independent labour candidate, Al Campbell campaigned on a platform of replacing the city's slums with affordable housing.\\"Working People Need Labour Representation!\\" Hamilton Spectator, Advertisement, Saturday, December 2, 1944, pg. 22. The CCF candidate, Frank Malloy, campaigned on his trade union credentials and his past service in World War One.\\"CCF Labour - Frank Malloy,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Saturday, December 2, 1944, pg. 22. On election night, McCulloch and Marshall won by considerable margins over their challengers. =Ward Five (Beasley- Jamestowne)= =Ward Six (Landsdale-Gibson)= The race in Ward Six was a contest between two long-term alderman and two candidates who campaigned on their labour credentials. Alderman John Hodgson, a member of the local Progressive Conservative establishment, had served on council since 1934. His ward-mate, Malcolm Heddle, had held the second Ward Six seat on council since 1942. The independent labour candidate, Alfred Stratford, campaigned under the slogan \\"A Labour Man For a Labour Ward!\\" and advocated for job security, slum clearance, and affordable housing for Hamiltonians.\\"Vote to elect Alf Stratford,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Advertisement, Saturday, December 2, 1944, pg. 22. Frank Reeves, the CCF candidate, campaigned on a ticket with Ward Six trustee candidate Bob Tilbury.\\"Vote CCF Labour in Ward Six,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Advertisement, Saturday, December 2, 1944, pg. 22. In their post- election commentary, the Hamilton Spectator noted that Reeves and Stratford \\"were never in the picture.\\" =Ward Seven (Stipley)= One of the most closely watched races of the 1944 election was the aldermanic battle in Ward Seven. One-term incumbent alderman Harry Hunter of the Labor-Progressive Party had announced his intention to seek election to the Board of Control, leaving an open contest for the ward's second seat. The other seat was contested by incumbent Frederick Hayward, who sought reelection on an independent platform. The city's LPP organization determined that best candidate to succeed Hunter on the party's ticket was Helen Anderson who placed second in the previous year's school board trustee race in the ward.\\"Trustees figure in stiff contests,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Tuesday, December 7, 1943, pg. 11. Anderson campaigned as the natural successor to Hunter, even using the phrase \\"For continued labour representation in Ward 7\\" on her election advertisements.\\"For continued labour representation in Ward 7\\" Hamilton Spectator, Saturday, November 25, 1944, pg. 23. Attempting a comeback in the ward was Sam Clarke, who had lost election the year prior by 50 votes. Clarke, believing his affiliation with the CCF-Labour slate was the reason for his defeat, publicly distanced himself from the party. In his election advertisements, Clarke went so far as to label himself a \\"Strictly Independent Candidate\\" to avoid any further associations between himself and the mayor's political slate. Clarke's 1944 campaign called for an increase in old-age pensions to $40 per-person, supports for affordable housing, and abolishing level crossings.\\"Vote to elect ex-Alderman Sam Clarke,\\" Hamilton Spectator, Saturday, November 25, 1944, pg. 23 The CFF candidate was M. T. Montgomery, a local trade unionist. Montgomery's candidacy was not reported on by the Spectator, nor did they mention his name in their summary of the elections. On election night, the ward was the closest, with Anderson and Clarke jockeying for support during the counting process. By the end of the night, Anderson had surpassed Clarke by 23 votes and the latter conceded defeat. =Ward Eight (Homeside- Bartonville)= References Category:1944 elections in Canada 1944 Category:1944 in Ontario ","title":"1944 Hamilton, Ontario municipal election"},{"id":"33222954","text":"Power Spot is an album by American trumpet player and composer Jon Hassell recorded in 1983 and 1984 and released on the ECM label.ECM discography accessed September 27, 2011 The cover art reproduces the Whirling Snakes or Whirling Mountain sandpainting of the Navajo Shooting Chant, one of the most important and most complex of the Navajo healing ceremonies.Whirling Snakes or Whirling Mt.

History and activities The International Federation of Women Lawyers (created in 1944) should not be confused with the International Federation of Female Lawyers and Judges (or F√©d√©ration internationale des femmes magistrats et avocats) founded in 1928 in Paris. According to the organization's history, 60 ann√©es d'histoire de la f√©d√©ration international des femmes des carri√®res juridiques (Melun: FIFCJ, 1989), the federation was created by Vera Poska-Gr√ºnthal (Estonia), Clara Campoamor (Spain), Marcelle Kraemer-Bach (France), Agathe Dyvrande-Th√©venin (France), and Margarete Berent (Germany). (Later sources say that Spanish politician and feminist lawyer Clara Campoamor and three other lawyers founded an earlier organization called the International Federation of Women Lawyers in Paris in 1928.) The Federacion Internacional de Abogadas was established in 1944 in Mexico City. It obtained United Nations Consultative status in 1954. It works with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). FIDA publishes La Abogada Newsletter four times a year in Spanish and English, for members only. Every two years FIDA publishes La Abogada Internacional in English, French and Spanish. In 2011 UNESCO said of the organization: \\"The quality of the work of the IFWL, a professional organization whose geographical extension is fair and representativeness relatively balanced, is undoubted. Admitted to Category C in 1961, it has co-operated with UNESCO since 1953 in the context of the consultative arrangements. It received a financial contribution from UNESCO for organizing the international congress of lawyers (1989). Its co-operation with UNESCO, which is operational in nature, has slackened in the last few years. It might consider drawing closer to NGOs that operate in similar fields.\\" Regional affiliates As of 2011 there were affiliated organizations and individuals in 73 countries: * Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Togo * Argentina, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, United States of America, Venezuela * Bangladesh, Hong Kong/China, India, Indonesia, Iran - Islamic Republic of, Israel, Japan, Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan/China, Thailand * Australia, New Zealand * Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland =Ghana= FIDA Ghana was founded in 1974. The association set up the first legal aid program in Ghana in 1985, mainly targeting indigent women and children. To help people understand the law, FIDA Ghana has developed booklets that present some of the existing laws affecting the status of women and children in simple English, and in translations into the Dagbani, Ewe, Ga, and Akan languages. =Kenya= FIDA Kenya was formed in 1985 after the third United Nations World Conference on Women, which was held in Nairobi. FIDA Kenya was affiliated to the Federation International De Abogadas until 1993. As of 2011 FIDA Kenya had over 600 members. FIDA Kenya prepared a \\"shadow report\\" on the Kenyan Government's 2007 report on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The report questioned the accuracy of the government's report and raised concerns about lack of government commitment to the advancement of women. =Nigeria= FIDA-Nigeria was founded in May 1982 to promote the welfare of women and children and remove harmful laws. It provides free legal services to women and children, provides education and publications to help explain the law, and runs seminars, workshops and conferences. Pamphlets cover subjects such as juvenile delinquency, rights of women, forced and early marriages and the effects of female circumcision.

It also prompted protests from the University of Malawi students, predominantly from the Chancellor College and Polytechnic campuses, who stood in solidarity with Chinsinga and CCASU in support of academic freedom. The protest led to the eventual closing of UNIMA's Chancellor College and Polytechnic. It led to the involvement of the then Minister Education, Peter Mutharika and his brother President Bingu wa Mutharika. President Mutharika ordered the lecturers back to class. As a condition to return to class, the academics asked for an official apology from the police chief, Peter Mukhito and assurances of respect for academic freedom.Malawi College Teacher Boycott Shows No Sign of Ending The police Inspector General Mukhito declared that academic freedom had to be balanced because this was an issue of national security. This statement was supported by Bingu wa Mutharika who encouraged him not to apologize because of a 'mere lecture'. The failure to resolve this matter and a stand off occurred between lecturers and students on one side, and the President of Malawi, Bingu wa Mutharika.

Plot  Nancy Botwin's family lives in Agrestic, a fictional suburb of Los Angeles. Her husband, Judah Botwin, dies of a heart attack while jogging with their younger son, a few weeks previously. Nancy's children, Silas and Shane, both attend Agrestic's public school in the early seasons of the show. During season 1, Silas is fifteen years old and Shane is ten. To support her upper middle class lifestyle, Nancy begins dealing marijuana to her affluent neighbors and friends. Andy Botwin, Judah's younger brother, moves into the house after Judah's death to help Nancy out, though he also seems to be there to freeload, and often disrupts her life. Nancy's supplier is Heylia James, a major distributor in Los Angeles' West Adams district, who she met through Heylia's nephew, Conrad (who is Andy's friend). After losing customers to a medical marijuana store, Nancy begins baking and selling pot- laced brownies. On the advice of her accountant, city councilman Doug Wilson, she opens a retail bakery, stocked with Costco baked goods, as a front for her drug sales. Silas begins dating Megan, an attractive deaf girl at his school. Shane, troubled by his father's death, acts out, such as biting the foot of another child in a martial-arts tournament, earning him the nickname \\"Strange Botwin\\" from his classmates. Nancy's chief antagonist is her neighbor, Celia Hodes, who is manic, image-obsessed, and manipulative. She is president of the Agrestic PTA, and does not get along with her cheating husband Dean, nor with her sexually active 15-year-old daughter, Quinn (Silas' previous girlfriend), who she sends off to boarding school in Mexico. Her younger daughter, 11-year- old Isabelle, is overweight and the target of her mother's passive-aggressive comments, although Isabelle seems mature and confident for her age. Isabelle reveals late in the season that she is a lesbian, to her mother's chagrin. Toward the end of the season, Celia is diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. The brush with her own mortality softens her personality and leads her to treat her own daughter with more courtesy and respect. She quickly returns to form after her recovery. However, before her surgery, she meets Conrad and has sex with him. After Andy is notified to report immediately for his military service (where he will be trained and then sent to Iraq) or be sentenced to a military prison, he announces that he is studying to become a rabbi because he believes it will provide grounds for him to be discharged. Drug dealing turns out to be more difficult than Nancy thought, as she discovers when she expands her customer base to Valley State College and hires Sanjay, a student at the college, to be her on-campus dealer. She is soon threatened by a rival drug dealer ‚Äì Alejandro ‚Äì who considers it his territory. She then has a brief sexual encounter with him. Also at Valley College, her entire stash of product is stolen by a campus security guard during a fake arrest, threatening the survival of her lifestyle. Unbeknownst to her, Conrad and friends pay a visit to the security guard, attacking and severely beating him. The result is that the guard politely returns the marijuana to a puzzled Nancy, apologizes, and offers to help her business in any way he can. Nancy and Peter Scottson, the single father of the kid bitten by Shane in a karate tournament, develop a mutual attraction, and they end up sleeping together. There is also attraction between Nancy and Conrad, much to Heylia's annoyance. The season closes with Conrad convincing Nancy to expand by becoming a grower as well as a dealer. They form a \\"team\\" that includes Doug, Dean, Sanjay and Andy. However, Nancy then encounters a complication: she learns that her new boyfriend Peter is a DEA agent.

Plot  The second season, while comedic, has a darker tone, as Nancy becomes increasingly involved in the more dangerous aspects of the drug world. In season two, Silas is sixteen years old and Shane is eleven. Ignoring Heylia's advice, Nancy and Conrad start their own small-scale growing operation and eventually rent a suburban \\"grow-house\\", where they can grow marijuana indoors using artificial light and hydroponics. She welcomes other people into her business, including her brother-in-law Andy and accountant (and customer) Doug. Peter Scottson tells Nancy that he knows she is a drug dealer, but considers her too small-time to be worth busting, and the two are married as part of a deal to legally protect Nancy from Peter testifying in a court of law. While Nancy's drug activities increase, Celia wins Doug's spot on the town council, due to the incompetence of husband Dean (a lawyer), who forgets to file Doug's paperwork, so leaving him off the ballot. She immediately launches a drug-free campaign across Agrestic, with drug-free zone signs and surveillance cameras. Doug and Celia share a strong desire for revenge on Dean, which inspires a brief sexual liaison. Silas and Megan's relationship threatens to finish once she leaves for college (she, a very serious student, is going to Princeton, while mediocre student Silas is going to a local school). Silas attempts to get her pregnant to prevent this, but instead his success leads to her parents forcing her to have an abortion and to a violent confrontation with Megan's father, ending the relationship. Andy tries to develop a relationship with an attractive, sexually formidable administrator, Yael Hoffman, at his rabbinical school, but this falls apart once he tells her he is planning to drop out, due to an incident at the grow house where a dog bites off two of his toes; he thinks this will invalidate his military obligation. Nancy's children become more aware of her illegal activities, although her sons deal with this in different ways. Shane continues to have problems fitting in at school and his friends begin to ridicule him for his sexual inexperience. To resolve the problem, Andy takes him to a massage parlor to get a \\"happy ending\\" hand job. Gaining confidence, Shane joins the debate team to get closer to Gretchen (a girl he had kicked in the hallway), who later becomes his girlfriend. However, he breaks up with her because of an infatuation with Andy's estranged ex-girlfriend, Kat. Silas takes out his frustrations through vandalism, most notably by stealing Celia's drug-free zone signs and cameras to help his mother. Meanwhile, Nancy has received threats from Armenian dealers who have local grow houses and see her as encroaching on their territory. Nancy tells Peter, and he has them all arrested. Nancy and Conrad's drug business does well as Conrad's strain of plant (which Snoop Dogg dubs \\"MILFweed\\" during a chance meeting at a recording studio) is popular with customers, but their high-profile causes trouble. Nancy and Conrad get intimate. Initially, Nancy's marriage to a DEA agent keeps her on top while her Armenian rivals were busted, but her marriage to Peter deteriorates after she tips off Heylia when the DEA plans to raid her house and Peter pressures her to quit dealing. For Nancy, the final straw is when Peter comes over for dinner and manhandles Silas. Nancy calls Conrad and tells him that she doesn't love Peter but will string him along until the current harvest is done; Peter hears the conversation with wireless surveillance. Meanwhile, Doug and Celia plan to leave their spouses. Celia tells Dean, but Doug refuses to leave his wife, Dana, stating that \\"she's a sweetheart\\" and their affair ends. Dean kicks Celia out of the house and demands a divorce. The season concludes with a complex series of betrayals, as Peter demands from Nancy and Conrad all of the cash from a quick sale of their crop. Heylia hires Armenian mobsters to kill Peter, as she believes Peter is planning to kill Conrad after the deal. Nancy's buyer, U-Turn demands the entire crop at gunpoint. The Armenian mobsters arrive at the same time, kill Peter, and expect the proceeds from the big sale to pay for their hit. When they realize that U-Turn plans to steal the weed, they decide to take the weed instead. Only then does Nancy discover that Silas has stolen the entire batch and will hold it until his mother allows him to join her business. Minutes after hiding the batch in his car trunk, he is approached by Celia and a police officer for the theft of the drug-free zone signs and surveillance cameras, because Celia has footage of Silas stealing the last camera. This leaves Nancy at the grow house, in a Mexican standoff with both the gangsters and the mobsters pointing guns at her in a season-ending cliffhanger.

Internet Security Systems, Inc., 511 F.3d 1186 (Fed. Cir. 2008), was a patent infringement case which determined whether technical documents placed on a company's FTP server could be considered prior art as defined by 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 102(b).. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware had held four of SRI International's patents invalid due to prior art considerations. A three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded the District Court decision. The decision is particularly relevant to patent law because it set the precedent for treatment of electronic information under the Federal Circuit's public accessibility precedents for prior art. The decision is also notable for an impassioned dissent-in-part filed by Judge Kimberly A. Moore. Background The case involved four United States patents filed by SRI International, Inc. (SRI). SRI attempted to license these patents to Symantec and Internet Security Systems (ISS). When these negotiations broke down SRI filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court of the District of Delaware, alleging that the patents were infringed by Symantec's ManHunt product and by ISS's Site Protector and Proventia products. Symantec and ISS moved for summary judgement that their products were non-infringing; the motion was denied. ISS and Symantec then moved for summary judgement that the patents were invalid due to prior art considerations. =Patents= All of the patents stem form a patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office by SRI on November 9, 1998. The patents involved methods for network intrusion detection. Patent Nos. 6,484,203 (the '203' patent) The '203' patent was approved on November 19, 2002.6,484,203, Porras, Philip Andrew & Alfonso Valdes, issued November 19, 2002 It outlined a computer- automated method for network monitoring and analysis where network monitors are deployed at gateways, routers or proxy servers. The network monitors detect suspicious network activities based on analysis of network traffic data from information included in the network packet. The suspicious activity is reported to other networks allowing appropriate counter-measures to be applied. Patent Nos. 6,711,615 (the '615' patent) The '615' patent was approved on March 23, 2004.6,711,615, Porras, Philip Andrew & Alfonso Valdes, issued March 23, 2004 Similar to the '203' patent, it also outlined a computer-automated method for network monitoring and analysis. Patent Nos. 6,321,338 (the '338' patent) The '338' patent was approved on November 20, 2001.6,321,338, Porras, Philip Andrew & Alfonso Valdes, issued November 20, 2001 It described a particular statistical algorithm for detecting suspicious network activity. In this method a long-term and short-term statistical profile was created from information in the network packets. The short-term profile could then be compared to the long-term profile pointing out changes in network activity, an indication of suspicious network activity. Patent Nos. 6,708,212 (the '212' patent) The '212' patent was approved on March 16, 2004.6,708,212, Porras, Philip Andrew & Alfonso Valdes, issued March 16, 2004 It described the combination of the statistical algorithm described in the '338' patent with the network monitoring methods described in the '203' and '615' patents. =Prior art= According to , a patent is invalid if \\"the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States\\". Since the patent application was filed on November 9, 1998, prior art determination focused on the date of November 9, 1997. The opinions of this case concentrated on four prominent cases in the determination of a document as a \\"printed publication\\". In re Bayer, In re Hall, and In re Cronyn were known as \\"thesis/library\\" cases and were used to define the boundaries of public accessibility of a printed document. The boundaries of public accessibility for a presentation were described in In re Klopfenstein, which is referred to as a dissemination case. =Papers= Disputes over patent validity were focused on the existence of two papers on SRI's website. EMERALD 1997 The EMERALD paper was presented to the National Information Systems Security Conference (NISSC) as \\"Event Monitoring Enabling Responses to Anomalous Live Disturbances\\".Phillip A. Porras and Peter G. Neumann, EMERALD: Event Monitoring Enabling Responses to Anomalous Live Disturbances, 20th National Information Systems Security Conference, October 9, 1997 EMERALD was described as a new approach to network surveillance with a streamlined event-analysis system combining signature analysis with statistical profiling. This paper provided part of the description for the '212' patent. This paper was published in October 1997. Live Traffic Paper The Live Traffic paper was presented at the Internet Society's Networks and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium as \\"Live Traffic Analysis of TCP/IP Gateways\\".Phillip A. Porras and Alfonso Valdes, Live Traffic Analysis of TCP/IP Gateways, Internet Society's Networks and Distributed Systems Security Symposium, December 12, 1997 The paper described statistical and signature-based techniques to monitor network traffic. Methods for the '212', '615', '338', and '203' patents were all described in this paper. The paper was published on SRI's website on November 10, 1997. Prior to this publication, the paper had been available on SRI's FTP server starting on August 1, 1997. District court analysis The case was heard by District Judge Sue Lewis Robinson on October 17, 2006. She held that the EMERALD paper enabled the '212' patent and that the Live Traffic paper qualified as prior art before November 9, 1997. The validity of the '212' patent hinged on the description given in the EMERALD paper. SRI argued the EMERALD paper was a \\"statement of intent\\" and could not be accomplished by a person with ordinary skill. SSI and Symantec contended that the details for implementing these methods were within the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill. Robinson concluded that the '212' patent was anticipated by the EMERALD paper over a year in advance of the patent application and was therefore invalid. The prior art qualification for the Live Traffic paper centered on the public accessibility of a document available on a FTP server. SRI argued that the FTP site was not publicly accessible because one would need the complete FTP address to view the paper. Additionally, the posting was not indexed and could only be found by an ordinary skilled user through \\"dumb luck\\". Symantec and SSI countered that on multiple occasions SRI had provided links to the FTP site to multiple members of the intrusion detection community. Furthermore, SRI's FTP site had been referenced by Google Groups and was widely regarded as a repository of information for computer security. Robinson's examination of the case evidence noted that no attempts were made to limit access via password security. Robinson deemed the Live Traffic paper publicly accessible as established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the precedent cases In re Bayer, In re Hall, In re Cronyn, and In re Klopfenstein. As such, Robinson ruled that the Live Traffic paper constituted as prior art and that the patents described in the publication were invalid. SRI subsequently appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Appeals court analysis A three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision on January 8, 2008. Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Randall R. Rader upheld the District Court's decision that the '212' patent was enabled by the EMERALD paper and therefore invalid. However, he concluded that there were issues of material fact about whether the Live Traffic paper constituted prior art. Since a grant of summary judgment requires that there be no remaining issues of material fact between the parties, the majority vacated and remanded the District Court's grant of summary judgment that the Live Traffic paper invalidated the '203', '212', '338', and '615' patents. In the decision, Rader discerned that there were two lines of Federal Circuit precedents which applied to the case. In the \\"library/thesis\\" line of cases, the Federal Circuit had set precedents regarding how the storage of documents affected their accessibility to persons interested and skilled in the field, and thus their status as prior art. In the \\"dissemination\\" line of cases, the Federal Circuit had set precedents regarding how dissemination of the document to persons interested and skilled in the field affected their accessibility and thus their status as prior art. As elements of both storage and dissemination occurred in SRI International, Rader's analysis attempted to determine where the case stood in relation to these precedents. =Library/thesis case analysis= As \\"library/thesis\\" precedents, Rader cited the Federal Circuit case In re Bayer, which had held that a graduate school thesis that had not been cataloged or placed on library shelves, and that was only known to the three faculty members who served on the thesis committee, did not qualify as a printed publication. Rader also cited the Federal Circuit case In re Cronyn, in which a thesis was placed in a library and indexed by the author's last name, and was determined not to qualify as a printed publication. Rader acknowledged that SRI International had elements in common with In Re Bayer. His analysis likened the uncatalogued nature of the thesis in the library to the posting of the Live Traffic paper on an FTP server which did not allow for searching and did not contain an index. According to Rader, the fact that Porras emailed direct links to those accessing the papers showed that a person skilled in the field would not have been able to access the Live Traffic Paper. Moreover, Rader argued that the public accessibility was less compelling for SRI International than it was for In re Bayer, as the document in the former case was in pre-publication review, while the thesis in the latter had already been completed. =Dissemination case analysis= As a \\"dissemination\\" precedent, Rader cited the Federal Circuit case In re Klopfenstein, which held that information presented on posters at professional conferences qualified as prior art, as the sole intent of such a poster is to publicly communicate research results. Rader recognized that, similar to the posters at a conference, the Live Traffic paper was posted in an open forum and might have been available to anyone with knowledge of FTP and the structure of SRI's FTP server. Unlike the posters at a conference, however, existence of the Live Traffic paper was not publicized or put in a location in which it could be viewed by interested people. According to Rader, SRI's posting of the Live Traffic paper on its FTP server was most similar to \\"placing posters at an unpublicized conference with no attendees\\". =Decision= Rader found that the Live Traffic paper was in a situation much more similar to the uncatalogued thesis in In re Bayer than the publicly disseminated posters in In re Klopfenstein. Rader concluded that the pre- publication Live Traffic paper could not be considered catalogued or indexed in a meaningful way and was not intended to be disseminated to the public. Rader concluded that, without additional information about the structure of SRI's FTP server, genuine issues of fact should have prevented the Delaware District Court from rendering summary judgment on the patent invalidity issues. The Federal Circuit thus vacated and remanded the Delaware District Court's determination of invalidity based on the Live Traffic paper. Moore's dissent-in-part Judge Kimberly A. Moore filed a detailed dissent-in-part, agreeing with the majority's decision that the EMERALD paper was enabling, but holding that the Live Traffic paper was publicly accessible and thus a prior art bar to patent validity. According to Moore, SRI failed to show evidence that there were genuine issues of material fact which would prohibit summary judgment, as required by Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules for Civil Procedure .Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) Moore argued that the defendants had met the burden of showing that the Live Traffic paper was publicly accessible, both from the \\"library/thesis\\" standpoint and the \\"dissemination\\" standpoint, while SRI had failed to provide any contrary evidence which would prevent summary judgment. Moore analyzed the case under the same precedents as those cited by the majority. She concluded that whereas the thesis in In re Bayer had not been catalogued, the structure of SRI's FTP server made the Live Traffic paper publicly accessible. According to Moore, the defendants had presented evidence that, given the host address for SRI's FTP server, one only needed to enter two directories to obtain the Live Traffic paper. The paper was stored under a directory titled \\"EMERALD\\", which she argued would have been an obvious searching place for anyone looking for information on the project. Moreover, the Live Traffic paper was stored under the name \\"ndss98.ps\\", the acronym for 1998 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, a well-known conference. This evidence, according to Moore, was sufficient for a determination that the Live Traffic paper was not at all similar to the thesis in In re Bayer. Thus, Moore held that the \\"library/thesis\\" cases could not be applied to deny the defendants their motion for summary judgment of patent invalidity. Moore also analyzed the case under the precedents set by the \\"dissemination\\" cases. In discussing the pertinence of In re Klopfenstein, Moore analyzed each of that case's four requirements for patent invalidity due to public disseminations. According to Moore, the Live Traffic paper was available on the FTP server 24 hours per day for seven days, longer than the three days during which the posters from In re Klopfenstein were displayed. Thus, the Live Traffic paper met the first requirement of being available for longer than a transient period. Moreover, SRI had admitted during oral arguments that the target audience of the paper was members of the Internet security community. The defendants showed that this community included people who knew how to use SRI's FTP server and actually used it to share information. Thus, the FTP server met the second requirement of being accessible to experts in the field. Furthermore, neither Porras nor SRI took any steps to ensure that the paper would not be copied. Porras emailed links to the paper to many people outside of SRI and failed to take protective measures such as non-disclosure agreements or even disclaimers. Thus, the Live Traffic paper met the third requirement of failing to create a reasonable expectation that the work would not be copied. Finally, the very nature of the Live Traffic paper as an electronic document forced it to meet the fourth requirement that the document be easy to copy. Thus, Moore held that the \\"dissemination\\" cases clearly showed that the Live Traffic paper was publicly accessible. Critical analysis SRI International is discussed at length in patent attorney Eric Guttag's treatise Applying the Printed Publication Bar in the Internet Age.. Guttag argues that SRI International has contributed to a growing confusion about whether electronic documents should be considered printed publications due to the Federal Circuit's conflation between the \\"dissemination\\" of a document and whether the document is publicly accessible, as in the \\"library/thesis\\" cases. Guttag is highly critical of the majority opinion's decision to simply cite In Re Bayer and In Re Klopfenstein without any real analysis and agrees that Judge Moore's much more careful analysis of the factors enunciated in In Re Klopfenstein are hard to overcome. Guttag concludes, however, that the simple fact that there is a disagreement between Moore and the majority is sufficient to support the majority's assertion that there are issues of material fact in the case and that summary judgment of invalidity is inappropriate.

Ordered in 1939 under the 4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme, she was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 April 1941 as I-80. Launched on 7 February 1942, she was renumbered I-180 on 20 May 1942, and completed on 15 January 1943. Service history At the end of March 1943, with her sister ships I-177 and I-178, I-180 departed from Truk to patrol off the east coast of Australia. There she torpedoed and sank the Australian merchant ship on 29 April 1943, the Norwegian merchant ship on 5 May 1943, and damaged the Australian merchant vessels Ormiston and Caradale on 12 May 1943. In mid-July 1943 I-180 was diverted from her patrol to Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands, arriving in the aftermath of the battle and rescuing 21 survivors from the light cruiser . On 12 October 1943, the Allies launched an air offensive against Rabaul, with 349 aircraft attacking the port and airfields. During the attack I-180 sustained a direct hit which wrecked her superstructure and prevented her from diving. She sailed on the surface back to Sasebo for repairs and was operational again early the next year. In late March 1944 she sailed from Ominato to patrol off the Aleutian Islands. On 19 April she sank the liberty ship SS John Straub, and almost certainly also sank the Soviet cargo ship Pavlin Vinogradov on 22 April. (Translated by Alexey Barmin & Dmitriy Tegin) Late on 25 April, she was detected while surfaced by the destroyer escort south-west of Chirikof Island.

He was judge of the Supreme Court, member of the judicial club of Corfu, lawyer, a member of the Ionian Academy and politician of the Ionian Islands in key positions in the offices of Senator, legislator, mayor of Corfu and Governor of Lefkada. During Vlassopoulos's tenure in Lefkada, Ali Pasha sent him an ultimatum to give him the armatolous, who were persecuted by Ali. They fled to Lefkada with their families. Vlasopoulos deliberately raised various obstructions, so Ali ordered cannon and troops to Arta, Preveza and Vonitsa and on land across from the island in order to invade it. Vlasopoulos succeeded through his diplomatic skills to save the Greek people of Lefkada from slaughter. In his later years, he served as advisor to the government of the Ionian Islands. In Corfu, he worked as a judge and a lawyer while he devoted himself to writing. He published works in Italian using the pseudonym Biagio Colonna (who according to at least one author, Michael Pratt, was Vlassopoulos himself), including La Difesa della Chiesa Greca (The Defense of the Greek Church), written in 1800 and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1803. For one period, he was editor of Corfiot publications Mercurio Litterario (1805‚Äì1808) and Gazetta Urbana (1802‚Äì1803).

It is seen as a novelty item. Description Umbrella hats have a typical umbrella canopy, with ribs supporting a fabric or plastic covering. This canopy is connected to a headband via four short shafts on every other rib to keep the canopy over the head. The canopy is generally collapsible, with the ribs and fabric collapsing around the headband shafts, much like a typical umbrella.1987 U.S. Patent Patent number: 4760610, Patent by Bing T. Wu for Umbrella Hat. Umbrella hats can come in a wide array of colors, and sizes, including national flags like the American Flag, the country where it was invented. History One of the earliest promoters of umbrella hats, Robert W. Patten, known as the Umbrella Man in Seattle, Washington, and San Jose, California. In December 1880, there was a patent taken out on the umbrella hat, patent 250,803. Robert W. Patten claimed that he invented the umbrella hat while he was prospecting in Mexico. His original hat also included a mosquito net attached to the canopy. Patten moved to Seattle in the 1890s and was dubbed the Umbrella Man. He then became a repairman for umbrellas, and inspired a cartoon from John Hager, depicting Robert Patten with his umbrella hat.History Link. Patten, Robert W. (1832-1913), Seattle's famed Umbrella Man. HistoryLink.org Essay 3149 Patten was seen as eccentric, and Hager's cartoons of him were comic. American baseball Hall of Famer Lou Brock was an aficionado and promoted and sold a version called the \\"brockabrella,\\" giving the device a bit of popularity in St. Louis in the mid 20th century. Today, the umbrella hat has advanced considerably. It is often associated as a cheap and comical novelty item, but it can be used to shield a person against rain or sunshine hands-free. Umbrella Hats are particularly useful to wheelchair users who need the use of both hands in the rain. It is also useful for gardeners, cyclists, walkers, shoppers, hunters, fishers, political canvassers and general manual laborers.

Music Sleep It Off was produced by Don Was. The songs were written by Cristina (all lyrics, except for the covers) collaborating with Was and her backing musicians, Barry Reynolds and Ben Brierly (from Marianne Faithfull's band), and Doug Fieger (from The Knack). The music is beat-laden, sophisticated synth-pop, setting Was's detailed production against Cristina's expressive but sometimes less-than-perfect, cynical No Wave vocal style. At times the music is reminiscent of Blondie, or Madonna, and it does not forget the decadent disco of Cristina's eponymous debut. [(opinion)] Chris Connelly describes a record that is a \\"grimly hilarious gavotte through the upscale decadence of the titled apocalypso\\" with an effect \\"somewhere between Marianne Faithfull and the Flying Lizards [but with] music more enjoyable than either\\". The three cover songs on the record span a wide range: the R&B; of Van Morrison's \\"Blue Money\\", Brecht and Weill's \\"Ballad of Immoral Earnings\\" from the Threepenny Opera, and John Conlee's country hit \\"She Can't Say that Anymore\\". (The bonus tracks on the CD release also include covers of Prince and Was (Not Was).) Sleeve The sleeve design is by Jean-Paul Goude, who later used a similar idea for Grace Jones's Slave to the Rhythm. Themes and reception Although featuring shorter, more hook-laden songs than her previous album, Cristina, Sleep It Off is a dark album. Cristina describes it as an album about \\"coping with sex and money and power plays in the 1980's\\", :In the sixties people survived on political idealism. In the seventies there was this obsession with 'lifestyle' - women's lib or a new religion, sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll, or a macrobiotic diet. Something was always THE ANSWER. In the eighties people are into power and money and narcissism because they don't know what else to believe in. I don't think the album has a cynical take on this. I guess I just believe that whatever's going on, trying to exist is a pretty trying business. Life knocks you down, all you can do is get back up, brush yourself off, cry a little, laugh a little and keep going. The album has been consistently lauded by critics. On its release in 1984, Rolling Stone said that :Sleep It Off is not for the MTV crowd, but so what? 'My life is in a turmoil/My thighs are black and blue/My sheets are stained, so is my brain/What's a girl to do?' Buy this record, I'd advise. Class is in session. The Face placed Sleep It Off in its Top 20 records of 1984. When the album was re-issued on CD in 2004, Pitchfork awarded it a grade of 8.5, remarking that Cristina's music gives :a glimpse of how complex and fun popular culture could've been if Harvard girl Cristina's intelligent kitsch had lodged itself in the popular conscious instead of the new-age pabulum of a desperately seeking diva with a goddess complex. Pitchfork also particularly praises the bonus tracks on the re- release. Ladytron included \\"What's a Girl To Do\\" on their Softcore Jukebox. Unfortunately, the record was a commercial flop and Cristina consequently retired. Track listing =Original Release (1984)= The original album release of Sleep It Off featured ten tracks.

The rebellion brought several cantons of the Swiss Confederation into conflict with each other and threatened a civil war in the Confederation. While Bern was initially successful, they were eventually forced to surrender most of their gains. Background At the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th Centuries, the Baron of Raron rapidly rose to the highest ecclesiastical and secular offices in the Valais. After the death of Bishop William I of Raron in 1402 and his father Peter of Raron in 1413, a rebellious party formed in the Upper Valais. They were opposed to the new Prince-Bishop Wilhelm II of Raron and the claims of his uncle Witschard of Raron. Emperor Sigismund had granted Witschard sovereignty over the Valais in 1414 as a reward for his military service in Lombardy. The rights over the Valais had been granted to the office of the Bishop of Sion in 999. The 1414 Imperial grant was supposed to transfer these rights from the office of the Bishop to the Raron family. The Zenden from Sierre to Goms were not willing to have gained independence from Savoy to then lose it to a local noble. Additionally, the baron had supported a Savoy invasion of the Ossola south of Valais, further fueling fears that the Baron of Raron would continue to support Savoy. Fearing that the Rarons planned to restrict their new freedoms, in 1415 the Zenden of the Upper Valais rebelled under the leadership of the Society of the Dog (so called because of the dog on their banner). The war The rebels besieged Witschard and his entourage at Seta Castle near Savi√®se and forced his resignation as episcopal bailiff along with the right to elect their own representatives in the government. Witschard was forced to leave Valais and appealed to Bern for help, but was unable to gain support. He then approached Amadeus VIII of Savoy, who allied with Witschard and sent troops into Valais. Around the same time, the three Zenden of the Upper Valais entered into a treaty with Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden. Supported by Savoy, the Rarons reoccupied their castles, but the rebellion continued in the valley. By 1417 Valais troops had destroyed Beauregard, Tourbillon and Montorge castles, all centers of the Raron power. Since the family held Bernese citizenship, they again appealed to the city for help in regaining their lands. When Bern took the Raron side against Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden it threaten to split the Swiss Confederation. The neutral cantons, Schwyz, Glarus, Zurich and Zug attempted to intervene and restore peace. However, this was unsuccessful and in September 1417 Witschard and his family had to flee the country permanently.von Wattenwyl, pg. 527 Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden were reluctant to directly oppose Bern, instead, they chose to invade the Ossola valley. They quickly drove Savoy troops out of the region and weakened the power of the Rarons in nearby Valais. In 1417 the Confederates met in Lucerne to negotiate a compromise within the Confederation. They were successful in reaching a temporary compromise, but after Valais troops attacked and besieged Raron castles, Bern invaded over the Sanetsch Pass and plundered Sion in 1418. On 25 April 1419 both sides met in Zurich to attempt to reach an agreement. By 15 May of the same year when negotiations were going against the rebels, the Valaisan forces chose to leave the negotiating table and plundered a number of Bernese sheep on the way. In response Bern attempted another invasion across the Grimsel Pass with about 13,000 men. Bern was joined in the invasion by Fribourg, Solothurn, Neuch√¢tel and a few troops from Schwyz. Both Uri and Unterwalden refused to send troops to either side of the conflict. The Bernese army marched through the canton burning villages as they came. Lacking support from their allies and outgunned, the Valais troops generally retreated. However, at the Second Battle of Ulrichen in September 1419 a force of 400 to 600 under the leadership of Thomas Brantschen ambushed and fought the Bernese army to a stand still. Fearing that winter storms would soon close the mountain passes the Bernese forces withdrew back over the mountains, followed by a force of 500 Valaisans. The Valais rebels were now isolated and had lost many of their homes while Bern had suffered heavy losses from a small force at Ulrichen. Both sides were now ready to negotiate. Aftermath Both sides met together at Zug late in 1419 with the Duke of Savoy as their mediator. On 25 January 1420 a final treaty was issued. Valais was to return the Baron of Raron's castles and lands and pay him 10,000 florins for his losses. They were to also pay Bern 10,000 florins, the Bishop of Sion 4,000 and the Duke of Savoy 1,000. Valais accepted the terms but continued to resist the Baron at every opportunity and continued to self-govern. With his authority damaged, his castles burned and a sullen population, the Baron abandoned Valais and died in Rome in 1431. The compromise reached in 1419 at Zurich reinforced the supremacy of the Confederation over the alliances of the individual members.

Metacritic gives the season a score of 82.  Plot  The season begins with the fallout from the botched drug deal of the season two finale. Celia finds and destroys the entire harvest; U-Turn pays the mobsters to leave Nancy and him alone; Silas is arrested and sentenced to community service; Sanjay comes out of the closet, but U-Turn forces him to have sex with a woman who becomes pregnant with his child. During season three, Silas and Shane remain the same age, however, as the season proceeds Shane turns twelve. During the first half of the season, Nancy works to pay off her debt to U-Turn, owed because U-Turn saved her life, and because Celia destroyed an entire harvest. Nancy also gets a legitimate job working for Sullivan Groff, a crooked developer from the neighboring community of Majestic, and soon becomes his lover. Celia, who has also been intimate with Groff, resents Nancy for this. Silas begins selling pot for his mother using the alias Judah, and meets Tara, an evangelical Christian who enjoys smoking pot and helps him to sell it. Shane and Isabelle become outcasts at the heavily-religious Majestic summer school and form a friendship. As familial stress increases, Shane begins having conversations with his dead father and insists Judah is really there. Nancy gets called in by the DEA and is terrified that her arrest is imminent. It turns out that her marriage to Peter Scottson has been discovered, and a hefty life insurance payment awaits. At U-Turn's behest, Conrad and Heylia start a grow business. U-Turn sees talent in Nancy and trains her to be his lieutenant, while simultaneously starting a war with rival Mexican dealers. When U-Turn has a heart attack while jogging, Marvin suffocates him and becomes the new boss. Marvin then botches an attempted truce with the Mexicans, allowing Nancy to clear all debts for her and Conrad and end the gang war. Debt-free, but feeling lonely, Nancy attempts to befriend Peter's ex-wife, Valerie. The two bond over their troubled lives. Their friendship turns sour when Valerie demands Peter's life-insurance money. Valerie feels it is rightfully hers, due to her longer marriage to Peter and the child they had together. Nancy promises to give it to Valerie, but has to first use most of it to replace the money Doug \\"borrowed\\" from the Agrestic treasury to help Nancy get back in business, pay his divorce lawyer, and get laser eye surgery. Despite receiving several payments, Valerie believes that Nancy will never give her the full amount, and also believes Nancy knows the location of Peter's hypothetical secret stash of cash. She hires a private investigator to trail Nancy. The investigator discovers Nancy is a drug dealer and blackmails her for most of the remaining life-insurance money, in exchange for not telling Valerie or the DEA. Nancy pays him, then ensures the investigator won't come after her again by blackmailing him for blackmailing her. Nancy confronts Valerie, telling her that she would have got the money, despite Nancy having no obligation to give it to her, but that now Nancy no longer has any money, thanks to the investigator Valerie hired. Meanwhile, the nearby community of Majestic has been attempting a hostile takeover of Agrestic, with Doug leading due to the large amount of money it would bring in. But Groff's gift‚Äîa new house in Majestic‚Äîto Celia leads to jealousy, and Doug begins sabotaging the Majestic city infrastructure, although it is already too late, as Celia puts it to a public referendum. To get back at Groff, Doug steals the giant cross from Majestic's megachurch, eventually putting it inside the grow house. Meanwhile, Dean has a motorcycle accident, which forces Celia to take care of him against her will. Heylia and Conrad are forced to move the grow operation and Nancy negotiates the use of Celia's off- the-books house in Majestic. Andy has a brief excursion into the pornographic film industry, at the same house, and later befriends a group of bikers while trying to score with one of its female members; they want him to start selling their weed. Nancy and Conrad become lovers while hanging out at the grow house, but Conrad realizes he has no future with her. Nancy turns to Guillermo‚Äîthe leader of the Mexican dealers‚Äîto get protection when the bikers threaten her family after she refuses to sell their low-quality \\"ditch weed\\". Guillermo decides to burn down the bikers' marijuana field, causing a huge fire which spreads to the Agrestic area. At that time, thermal cameras spot the stolen cross and the DEA moves in. Nancy takes advantage of the fire and pours gasoline throughout her house and lights it with a match, ensuring that she and her family will be leaving and moving on, and there will be no evidence of their drug activities.

It started on Monday, June 16, 2008 and concluded on Monday, September 15, 2008. The season opener \\"Mother Thinks the Birds are After Her\\" was the last episode with \\"Little Boxes\\" as the theme song until Season Eight. The opening credits of subsequent episodes, after a recap of previous episodes, begin with a video title card unique to each episode. For the second episode of the season, for example, a highway sign reads \\"Weeds ‚Äì Created by Jenji Kohan\\" ‚Äî the embedded text used for all title cards since the show's inception. Each title card also has a prop or part of the setting that refers to a plot element in the episode. Some part of the title card morphs into a cannabis leaf. In the highway sign example, a downward arrow designating a lane becomes a slightly larger leaf. Silas and Shane are aged 17 and 13 respectively. However, Silas turns 18 at the end of the season.  Plot  Having lost both her Agrestic grow house and her residence in fires, Nancy relocates her family to the fictional California town of Ren Mar, near the Tijuana-San Diego border. They move in with Andy and Judah's grandmother in Ren Mar. Guillermo hires Nancy to bring illegal drugs from Mexico. She finds out after delivery that her smuggling abilities were being tested ‚Äî she was transporting legal asthma inhalers. Celia is in jail due to being the official lessee of Nancy's grow house. She bargains to spy on Nancy for the DEA in exchange for her release. Guillermo's men catch Celia spying but Nancy convinces them to spare Celia's life by claiming she was her partner. Andy enters a coyote partnership with Doug, who has recently moved to Ren Mar to evade questions about Agrestic's finances. Isabelle is unenthusiastic about moving from Ren Mar to her father in Detroit and pesters her mother Celia until she lets her daughter stay with her. Silas sets up a grow room in the rear of a gourmet cheese shop owned by a neighbor (Julie Bowen), an attractive woman in her thirties. Despite knowing that Silas is under 18, she becomes intimate with him. She reveals to Silas that her interests in him are just financial and physical, causing a heartbroken Silas to spurn her advances and to end their business relationship after her ex-husband catches them in the act. Meanwhile, Shane attacks the most popular boy at school without provocation, in order to acquire a fearsome reputation. He also attracts the admiring attention of Simone and Harmony, with whom he loses his virginity in a threesome. Guillermo's boss, whose identity is unknown to Nancy, has her open a maternity store. She believes it is solely for money laundering until she finds a tunnel entrance in the back room. She is told it is for transporting marijuana from Tijuana. Nancy later learns that the tunnel helps transport other controlled substances, as well as guns and women. Shocked, Nancy informs DEA Captain Roy Till, even though she has begun a sexual relationship with Guillermo's crime boss, revealed as Esteban Reyes (Demi√°n Bichir), Mayor of Tijuana. The resulting DEA raid and shootout ends with most of the Mexican drug runners arrested. While working at Nancy's store, Celia begins abusing the readily-available drugs. Isabelle and Dean stage an intervention, which spurs Celia to enter rehab and make amends to her family. Dean rejects her attempts, insisting that Celia instead locate and make amends with their oldest daughter, Quinn, who departed during the show's inaugural episode for a Mexican boarding school named Casa Reforma. Newly graduated, Quinn and her boyfriend, a self-styled Mexican revolutionary, drug Celia and hold her hostage in order to extract a $200,000 ransom. Esteban captures and intends to have Nancy killed after discovering she had alerted the DEA to his tunnel. After Nancy discloses that she is carrying his child, possibly a boy (he has only daughters), he spares her. At home, Shane steals Silas' weed, and Simone and Harmony help him to sell it at school. Doug falls for an undocumented woman he names \\"Mermex\\" after witnessing her unsuccessful attempt to enter the United States via the ocean. After much searching, Doug locates Mermex and uses his coyote enterprise to get her into California. Though he expects her to be grateful, Mermex is instead repelled by Doug's unapologetic nature and genital warts. She has fallen in love (and slept with) Andy, now a folk hero known as \\"El Andy.\\" Scorned, Doug turns Mermex in to immigration. Realizing that poverty effectively prevents him from having to pay any judgments, Doug writes to his estranged wife, daring her to take him to court. In a scene paying homage to The Shawshank Redemption, he then appears to prepare to hang himself, but actually masturbates using auto-erotic asphyxiation. Andy wonders if he is in love with Nancy and questions why he has stayed with the family for so long.

The season finale episode premiered on Monday, August 31, 2009, averaging 1.3 million viewers, up versus season 4's finale that averaged 1 million.  Plot  After Nancy informs Esteban that she's pregnant, Esteban allows her to live but has bodyguards assigned to her, and Nancy is forced to undergo a test to be sure the baby is both a boy and his. Anxious for Shane's safety, Nancy has Andy take him to her sister, Jill Price-Grey (Jennifer Jason Leigh). However, Jill returns with Shane and Andy after Shane takes pictures of Andy and Jill having sex. Meanwhile, Silas draws up a new plan to start a legal medical marijuana business with Doug, which Nancy funds. After Nancy's initial bodyguard goes missing, Ignacio serves as her new bodyguard; Shane witnesses violence at the hands of Ignacio, who helps Shane and Isabelle steal from a teacher who stole Shane's pot. Quinn's attempt to extort money for Celia's return to her friends and family fails miserably, since none of them are willing to pay any ransom. After Rodolfo angrily breaks up with Quinn, Celia tries to get Rodolfo to let her stay with him, but he drugs her and puts her on a bus to Texas. Celia ends up squatting in Nancy's garage, where she finds the body of the missing bodyguard. Ignacio catches DEA agent Captain Roy Till; Nancy calls Esteban, who orders Till's murder. Andy wants Nancy to have an abortion and flee with him, suggesting that she will never be free if she has a baby with Esteban. However, Nancy instead leaves a note for Andy, saying she and Shane have moved in with Esteban. Six months later, Esteban proposes to Nancy and she accepts, but Pilar (Kate del Castillo), a powerful woman in Mexican politics, forces Esteban to break off the engagement. Cesar, Esteban's chief aide, arranges a birthing room in the house, so there will be no record of the baby's birth. Escaping Esteban's house with Andy's aid, Nancy appeals to her obstetrician, Dr. Audra Kitson (Alanis Morissette), who takes her to the hospital and delivers the baby. Andy later begins a relationship with Dr. Audra. To protect his political career, Esteban doesn't sign the birth certificate. Nancy moves back in with Andy, who agrees to sign the birth certificate, hoping she'll free herself from Esteban. He also convinces Nancy to give the baby a Bris, much to Esteban's dismay. Esteban wants to see his son and comes to Nancy's door, again asking her to marry him. Simultaneously, an assassin trying to shoot Nancy misses and hits Shane in the left shoulder. When confronted by Nancy, Cesar admits to being an informant for Pilar (who ordered the hit on Nancy), but the execution was not completed because Cesar could not bring himself to do it. Nancy keeps the betrayal from Esteban in exchange for getting to shoot Cesar in the arm to avenge Shane's injury. Esteban finds himself replaced as a candidate for governor, but with encouragement from Nancy, he runs as an independent. Meanwhile, Silas' and Doug's shop is having problems: Doug keeps eating their products, is stoned all the time, and does not keep up his work responsibilities. Moreover, the policeman in their pay begins demanding more money. After being raided by the police in an Internal Affairs sting against the cop, the two lose all of their pot, and they turn to Dean to help them get it back. Celia gets a job as a home sales representative for a cosmetics company, but unable to sell the makeup, Celia manipulates Dean into giving her the pot and starts selling it packaged with the cosmetics. At the end of the season, Celia begins a team with Doug, Dean, Sanjay, Ignacio, and Isabelle to sell marijuana, in a deliberate echo of Nancy in season one. The family moves into Esteban's house, and Nancy and Esteban get married. Nancy visits Guillermo in prison to arrange for the assassination of Pilar, in exchange for Guillermo's extradition to Mexico. Esteban becomes the front- runner for governor despite Pilar's rejection, but is arrested for suspicion of conspiracy, racketeering and tax evasion. When Nancy and Cesar attempt to retrieve Esteban from jail, they learn via national television that Esteban has been already released and is again running for governor - but on Pilar's platform. Pilar has arranged for his arrest, and is blackmailing Esteban into becoming her political puppet. Pilar confronts Nancy and tells her that she and Esteban must do everything Pilar dictates. During a fundraising party, Pilar corners Nancy by a pool on the outside deck. Pilar reveals to Nancy that she has been aware of her actions, and suggests that the apparent accidental deaths of Shane and Silas would generate a sympathy vote for Esteban. Nancy threatens to kill Pilar if she endangers Nancy's children. At that moment, Pilar is whacked in the head by an unseen third party and ends up floating face down in the pool, bleeding profusely from the head. Shane appears next to Nancy, holding a croquet mallet.

The song developed from a riff created by guitarist the Edge, and is played in a time signature.http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Acrobat Lyrically, the song expresses themes of hypocrisy, alienation, and moral confusion. Although \\"Acrobat\\" was rehearsed prior to the third leg of the Zoo TV Tour, it had not been performed live until its debut on the Experience + Innocence Tour on 2 May 2018. Inspiration, writing, and recording Lead singer Bono was influenced by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of \\"Acrobat\\", to whom the song is dedicated. The title of his first book, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, is quoted in the final verse. Bono noted the book \\"was on my mind when I was writing the words... It's hard to wrap the book up in a few lines, but Delmore Schwartz is kind of a formalist... I'm the opposite. I'm in the mud as a writer, so I could do with a bit of [Schwartz], and that's why I enjoy him.\\" The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland, New Zealand, on the Lovetown Tour in 1989.Flanagan (1996), p. 444 He noted that the beat is unusual for a U2 song, saying it \\"was the jumping off point, to try and do something with an unusual beat.\\" Producer Daniel Lanois became disoriented with the direction U2 took \\"Acrobat\\" during its recording. Bono noted \\"Daniel had such a hard time on that... he was trying to get us to play to our strengths and I didn't want to. I wanted to play to our weaknesses. I wanted to experiment.\\" Bono noted that the end product \\"doesn't quite get off the ground the way I'd hoped it would.\\" An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. The mix, titled \\"'Baby' Acrobat\\", contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective (\\"You know I'd hit out if I only knew who to hit\\" instead of the final \\"I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit\\") or scrapped entirely (\\"If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will you dig me out when I'm face down in the mud\\"). Composition and theme \\"Acrobat\\" is played in a time signature. The Edge noted \\"it's a very Irish time signature, it's used in a lot of traditional Irish music, but in rock and roll you don't really hear it that much.\\" In the time leading up to the start of the Achtung Baby sessions, U2 listened to records which had a \\"hard-edged industrial kind of sound\\", including works by KMFDM and Sonic Youth, as well as artists such as Roy Orbison and Jacques Brel. These influences led the band to seek the creation of songs which were harder musically than their previous work, while remaining personal lyrically. \\"Acrobat\\" is one of the most personal songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained \\"a bit of venom\\", likening it to \\"the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical.\\" Bono stated \\"as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [goes] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution\\".Assayas (2005), p. 106 In 2006, he noted it was \\"a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally\\", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric \\"I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that\\". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" with \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". Speaking of its theme he said \\"at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position.\\" Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the \\"aggressive and venomous\\" song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying \\"Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past.\\" U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's habit of keeping his lyrics \\"in flux until the last minute\\" with providing a narrative coherence to the album.Flanagan (1996), p. 20 Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home.Flanagan (1996), p. 187 For Flanagan, the final three songs on Achtung Baby‚Äî\\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\", \\"Acrobat\\", and \\"Love Is Blindness\\"‚Äîare about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other. Hot Press writer Joe Jackson felt that the song was dominated by a theme of moral confusion. Author John Luerssen believed the song was about \\"the fight to persevere\\". He added it \\"was long on piss and vinegar, as evidenced by its snarling, cynical approach.\\" Craig Delancey, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York, cited the conclusion of \\"Acrobat\\" as an example of how rock music can be \\"profoundly successful at evoking the mixture of anger and contempt that can keep you going in the face of seemingly overwhelming opposition.\\" He noted that \\"the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Babys 'Acrobat' can help us feel motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless.\\"Delancey (2006), pp. 130-131 Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted \\"here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance.\\"Cleveland (2006), p. 182 Robyn Brothers felt the line \\"I'd break bread and wine / If there was a church I could receive in\\" referenced feelings of spiritual alienation.Brothers (1999), p. 257 She compared the song to \\"Zooropa\\", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation.Brothers (1999), pp. 251, 257 Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric \\"What are we going to do now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read\\" was an examination of the band's longevity, stating \\"Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness.\\" He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to \\"The Fly\\", noting that both songs were \\"delivered in an amoral voice\\" and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line \\"Don't let the bastards grind you down\\" was a retaliation to the criticism of the press.Stokes (2005), p. 108 Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually \\"unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us.\\"Wurtzel (2003), p. 97 Reception \\"Acrobat\\" received mixed reception from critics. The Kitchener Record felt that the song added to the band's \\"tremendous presence\\", saying that it showed the band's commitment to each individual song and that it \\"indicates a very clear evolution in Bono's lyricism and the band's clear artistic focus.\\" Bono named it one of his favourite U2 songs, a sentiment that The Edge agreed with.McCormick (2006), p. 228 Stokes said \\"For most writers, 'Acrobat' would have been a slow song... it was a brave attempt by a rock 'n' roll band to find a distinctive, hard edge, for what was essentially another love song.\\" Martin rated the track 4 stars, describing it as \\"deliciously dark\\". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe felt it was one of the album's \\"exceptional love songs\\". Greg Potter of The Vancouver Sun believed it \\"sums up Bono's lyrical direction and mindset better than any song on the album... alluding to the theory that true contentment must begin from within.\\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times had a more negative opinion of the song, calling the lyrics \\"pompous\\". Bill Wyman of Entertainment Weekly was similarly dissenting, stating \\"'Acrobat' ‚Äì formless and overwrought ‚Äì is just a mess.\\" The theme of moral confusion cited by Jackson was later used in U2's song \\"Zooropa\\", from the 1993 album of the same name. The coda in \\"Zooropa\\" features the lyric \\"dream out loud\\", which Bono included as a reference to \\"Acrobat\\".Stokes (2005), pp. 111‚Äì112 The phrase \\"dream out loud\\" was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989,de la Parra (2003), p. 136 and has appeared several times in U2's work since then, including the song \\"Always\\" ‚Äî a B-side to the \\"Beautiful Day\\" single released in 2000 ‚Äî and being spoken by Bono in the PopMart: Live from Mexico City concert release. Live performances \\"Acrobat\\" was rehearsed extensively in an acoustic form prior to the third leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1992.de la Parra (2003), p. 151 The end of the song segued into the beginning of \\"Zoo Station\\", leading concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra to speculate that it was being considered to open the set. However, the band did not end up performing it during the tour. In 2006, the Edge said \\"it never became a live favourite... I don't think that is what people come to U2 for.\\" In 2012, Willie Williams, U2's lighting designer and concert director, described the rehearsed version as \\"extremely dramatic\\", saying \\"in a stadium situation it could be argued that it might have the same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling the audience to fuck off.\\" \\"Acrobat\\" had not been performed live in more than 26 years,Luerssen (2010), p. 262 until the band finally gave the song its debut performance during the Experience + Innocence Tour on 2 May 2018. Prior to performances of the song on tour, Bono adopted the stage character \\"MacPhisto\\", a representation of the devil that he previously portrayed on 1993 legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The character was depicted through an augmented reality video filter applied to Bono's face on the video displayed on the screens. As MacPhisto, he commented on recent events in the US such as the 2017 Charlottesville rally by riffing on the lyrics from the Rolling Stones' song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". MacPhisto punctuated this monologue by saying, \\"when you don't believe that I exist, that's when I do my best work\\". This segued into performances of \\"Acrobat\\". Bassist Adam Clayton confirmed that part of the reason for finally playing the song was because devoted U2 fans had been requesting it. Critics noted the relevance of the song's opening lines \\"Don't believe what you hear/Don't believe what you see\\" in the post-truth world of the time. Covers The song was covered by the Dutch band Kane on their 2000 live album With or Without You. Glasvegas reworked the song for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. \\"Doing this, I was fantasising I was Bono, shades and all,\\" remarked singer James Allan. \\"I was singing the line, 'Don't let the bastards drag you down,' feeling determined rather than angry. Before we started, Rab [Allan, guitarist] said, 'What are you thinking about this U2 cover?' I said, 'Ach, it'll be easy: just make it sound bigger than U2'.\\" Personnel U2 *Bono ‚Äì vocals *The Edge ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals *Adam Clayton ‚Äì bass guitar *Larry Mullen, Jr. ‚Äì drums, percussion Technical *Production ‚Äì Daniel Lanois *Engineering ‚Äì Flood *Mixing ‚Äì Flood and Lanois *Engineering and mixing assistance ‚Äì Shannon Strong See also *List of covers of U2 songs - Acrobat References Footnotes Bibliography    * External links *Lyrics at U2.com * Category:1991 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Daniel Lanois Category:Songs written by Adam Clayton Category:Songs written by Bono Category:Songs written by Larry Mullen Jr. Category:Songs written by the Edge Category:U2 songs it:Achtung Baby#Acrobat ","title":"Acrobat (song)"},{"id":"33223878","text":"Colin Webster-Watson (6 May 1926, Palmerston North, New Zealand ‚Äì 25 September 2007, Eastbourne) was a New Zealand sculptor and poet.

Plot  After Shane kills Pilar, the Botwin family flees north. Andy joins them after Audra breaks off their relationship. Unable to enter Canada without the baby's birth certificate, Nancy, Andy, Silas, Shane, and Stevie assume new identities as \\"The Newmans\\" (as Nathalie, Randy, Mike, Shawn, and Avi, respectively) and settle in Seattle, Washington. Silas and Shane remain the same age this season while Stevie is three months old. Nancy, Andy, and Silas take menial jobs as scab labor at a local hotel, where Nancy discovers the resident drug dealer is also on strike. Sensing an opportunity, Nancy seeks out a local distributor (Linda Hamilton) and, lacking enough money to buy much marijuana, instead buys the seller's trimmings and produces hashish using the hotel's laundry equipment. While the rest of the family works, Shane babysits Stevie. Back in southern California, Esteban tasks Cesar and Ignacio with finding Nancy and bringing back his son. While looking for clues at the Ren Mar house, they encounter Doug and coerce him into helping find the Botwins. As Nancy and Andy leave the weed dealer's house, they are confronted by two police officers and questioned about unpaid parking tickets linked to the (stolen) license plates on Andy's minivan. The family flees again. Cesar and Ignacio receive a phone call from Doug about the location of the van (which blew a tire when Andy tried to remove a police boot with a blowtorch). Cesar, Ignacio, and Doug travel to Seattle and search for clues in the van. Nancy convinces Silas to steal his girlfriend's car. She spots Doug tied up in the back of Cesar's car at the motel, while Cesar argues with the manager. Nancy panics and attempts to gather the family, a series of events transpires, culminating with Shane calling his mother to tell her he has been kidnapped by Cesar and Ignacio. Cesar negotiates a trade with Nancy: Shane for Stevie. Despite agreeing, Nancy meets Cesar with Gayle's crossbow hidden in a bassinet, then shoots Cesar in the leg. She receives a phone call from Ignacio, who unintentionally tells her about his run in with her three sons, Andy, and Doug at the local diner. When Nancy arrives there, she joins the group at the table and attempts to negotiate with Ignacio by holding a gun under the table. Ignacio calls her bluff ‚Äì Shane then takes the gun. Ignacio reluctantly folds to Shane. Now the Botwin family and Doug continue what Andy refers to as off-the-grid living. During their flight, they stop at a carnival, despite Andy's disapproval. They end up winning an RV, but are unable to claim it without proper identification. Liking the idea of RV travel, they purchase an older used RV and travel to an out-of-the-way trailer park. Andy and Doug pose as a preacher and assistant, taking appropriate donations. A frustrated Nancy goes to a bar and has sex with the bartender. The next day she finds out the bartender has a wife who is also her neighbor and they are subsequently chased out of town. As the Botwins continue their nomadic lifestyle on the lam in their RV, they stop in Colorado. They continue to bargain for the trimmings of other dealers' weed. In Aspen, Colorado, Nancy and Andy drop off Silas and Shane to sell hash at a concert. When Stevie's feces are an abnormal color, Nancy decides he needs a pediatrician. Shane discovers Silas wants to apply for college, and Silas in turn learns Shane doesn't have any of his own back up plans. At the pediatrician's office, Nancy sees herself on TV listed as a missing person. The doctor says Stevie is fine, but suggests the baby may not be bonding with her, and that the baby's lifestyle could be a factor, making her rethink their way of life. Andy suggests moving to Denmark. Nancy agrees. The group travels to Nancy's hometown, Dearborn, Michigan, where they stay with Nancy's former high school teacher Mr. Schiff (Richard Dreyfuss), with whom she had a sexual relationship from the age of 14. Silas discovers that Judah is not his biological father; in fact, his father is Nancy's former boyfriend Lars. The Botwins are found by an investigative journalist named Vaughn, who is writing an article about Nancy. She gives him the information he needs to write the story in exchange for cash to buy passports. Doug returns to Agrestic, retitled Regrestic after the fire, where he tries to win back his wife. Mr. Schiff steals money from a post office for plane tickets to Copenhagen for the family, himself included. Silas says goodbye to Nancy, intending to stay behind with Lars. Nancy goes to meet Vaughn a final time before leaving, only to find his room has been ransacked, and Esteban and Guillermo are waiting for her. Esteban and Guillermo take Nancy to the airport to find Stevie. Nancy manages to contact Andy, telling him to use \\"Plan C\\". Esteban threatens Silas and takes Stevie; Nancy agrees to leave the airport with them, and they tell her they are going to kill her. Andy, Silas, Shane and Mr. Schiff board the plane to Copenhagen (via Paris), but Mr. Schiff is arrested for robbing the post office. As Nancy leaves the airport, the FBI confront her outside. As part of \\"Plan C\\", she confesses to the murder of Pilar, simultaneously saving her own life, ensuring the safety of her family, and covering for Shane.

Occupiers first marched in Los Angeles on September 24, 2011. They next protested a fundraiser being held in Hollywood at the House of Blues for President Obama. Participants met at Pershing Square every subsequent night to plan out the logistics of an occupation set to begin on October 1, 2011. After debating potential locations around Los Angeles, people decided on the lawns around City Hall. Tents first manifested on October 1, 2011 on the grounds of Los Angeles City Hall. The camp experienced a relatively uncontentious relationship with the city through its duration. On November 17, Occupy Los Angeles joined with a permitted organized labor march through downtown Los Angeles. The parade was generally orderly, though a circle of about twenty protesters surrounded three tents in the middle of a street in deliberate disobedient behavior and were arrested. Later in the day, an unpermitted march went to a plaza at the base of the Bank of America tower, when police brought the march to a halt. More protesters were arrested for trespassing, 73 total for the day. Overview =Supporters= The movement had several celebrity appearances including NOFX, Amanda Palmer, Jesse Jackson, Bill Maher, Shepard Fairey, Tom Morello (from Rage Against the Machine) Jeff Ross. and Danny Glover Some of these visitors were interviewed by InsightOut News, a grassroots journalism website that emerged from Occupy LA. These interviews were sometimes critical, raising the issue of whether wealthy celebrities could really be aligned with the working class. =City Hall eviction= Antonio Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles, announced an eviction order deadline of Monday morning, November 28, at 12:01 a.m., giving the reason that \\"It is time to close the park and repair the grounds so that we can restore public access to the park.\\" Early Monday morning protesters and the encampment remained after the city ordered an end their protest. Four people were arrested for unlawful assembly. On Tuesday, November 29, 1,350 police raided Occupy Los Angeles. Five hundred police officers quickly entered the park out of City Hall doors. At 12:30 a.m. LAPD declared the Occupy L.A. site an unlawful assembly, and told demonstrators they had 10 minutes to clear the area or be arrested. A total of 292 people were arrested. After the encampment was empty, 30 tons of trash was removed. Report of Patrick Meighan Patrick Meighan, writer for the Fox animated sitcom Family Guy, was one of the 292 arrests made on November 29. He posted an account of his arrest. He also participated in an eight-part YouTube interview chronicling, in more detail, his experience the night of the raid. May Day On May 1, 2012, Occupy Los Angeles resurfaced publicly joining general May Day protests all around Los Angeles. The Occupy supporters organized as \\"four winds\\" coming in to downtown Los Angeles from the four directions, starting in Van Nuys in the north, Santa Monica in the west, Cal State Dominguez Hills in the south and East Los Angeles College in the east. A General Assembly was conducted in Pershing Square. Occupy San Fernando Valley, Occupy Rose Parade and Occupy the Hood were all represented. Numerous other protesting groups joined.

As the season picks up, Nancy has spent three years in prison and now lives in a strictly monitored halfway house in New York City, where the family meet after the other Botwins have spent three years in Denmark.  Plot  Andy, Doug, Silas, and Shane have been living in Copenhagen for the last three years. Silas is 24 years old and Shane is 18 years old. Shane was a puppeteer with his now ex- girlfriend, Silas found work as a model for \\"some flower water\\", and Andy and Doug gave tours of Copenhagen under the name \\"Wonderful Wonderful Tours\\" (recalling the premiere of season five, Wonderful Wonderful). Nancy's sister Jill, who has been raising Stevie to believe Nancy is his aunt, tells them Nancy has been released and is in a halfway house in New York City. They return to New York City to find Nancy, who flees in shame upon seeing them. Silas tries to start up his modeling career under the name Silas Guinard, the last name of his biological father Lars Guinard. Doug meets an old college buddy, who gets him hired at a venture capital firm. Andy and Shane finally meet Nancy when she comes back to the halfway house from a job interview. Jill informs Nancy she wants custody of Stevie. Nancy and Silas fly to California to attend a custody hearing, only to find it has been postponed by Jill's lawyer. Nancy drives to Jill's house to visit Stevie, but is refused. Nancy strikes a deal with Scott, Jill's husband, to allow her to use a webcam to see Stevie in secret. Meanwhile, Silas attempts to negotiate with the judge handling the custody case to have the hearing resumed. The judge agrees to meet with Nancy in his chambers and advises her to \\"return to those who helped you succeed... Be the Nancy that raised Silas.\\" While in California, Nancy attempts to obtain pot from her original supplier, Heylia James, only to be greeted by a shotgun. Dean stops the ensuing shootout; he has moved in with Heylia in return for his legal help regarding marijuana laws. Heylia is cultivating a massive field of Silas' and Conrad's MILF weed. Nancy and Heylia tentatively rekindle their old friendship. Back in New York, Shane wins the favor of an aggressive guest detective speaking in one of his criminal justice classes. Andy pitches his motorized \\"Copenhagen Wheel\\" to Doug's business associates, only to be met with ridicule. Silas confronts Nancy about having kept him in the dark for so much of his life as to his true father's identity. Even after their initial hostility, Heylia ultimately agrees to provide Nancy with a shipment of MILF weed in New York, in exchange for Silas's labor in harvesting the current crop, and Silas agrees. Nancy manages to see Stevie briefly at a planetarium, but he seems to have only a mild attachment to his biological mother. She whispers something into his ear before leaving. Shane also decides to provide Andy with the financial backing to open his \\"Copenhagen Wheel\\" business, hoping it will be a successful business in its own right, as well as a cover for Nancy's prospective weed business. Silas returns to New York in Heylia's van. Shane starts taking criminal justice classes, where he impresses, befriends, then apprentices under a working NYPD detective. Nancy gets involved with the SEC in hopes of obtaining an early release from the halfway house. Pouncy House, Silas' main competition, threatens him. Nancy makes a trip to Zoya's brother's apartment to pick up some marijuana, and finds Zoya has been released early. Nancy is forced to make love to her old cell mate. They are watched. Nancy then makes love to her ex-cell mate's brother (Demetri). She is not allowed to leave with the drugs she came to pick up. Following the SEC investigator's instructions, Nancy allows herself to be wired and goes on a date with the CEO of Doug's company. She takes him home. Silas is there with Zoya's brother, who has delivered the weed. Zoya shows up and ostentatiously kisses Nancy. Nancy, not wanting the SEC agents to hear the details of her drug business, tries to muffle the mic with a pillow and loud music, then makes a fast retreat back to the CEO's home and sleeps with him. Nancy informs the CEO that she was wearing a wire for the SEC. The CEO flees and Nancy promptly sets fire to his home, knowing Zoya's history of arson and prior threats to the CEO will make her the prime suspect. The SEC agents meet with Nancy, threatening to throw her back in jail. Doug saves the day when he demands that the agents let everything slide, because their pension funds are tied to the CEO's company. The chief agent buys weed from Nancy. Zoya, fearing new criminal charges, flees to Vermont to realize her dream of starting a pet boarding facility. With Zoya out of the way, Nancy again sets to selling drugs, using Doug's corporate position to give herself leverage against their main competition, Pouncy House Party Rentals. Under the pretext of updating a computer, Shane prints out a police report on Pouncy House. He shows the files to Nancy who, preoccupied with her personal drama, leaves the file on the counter. Silas meets Emma, who claims she is a disgruntled Pouncy House employee, for lunch. Silas, enamored, offers her a job on their team, and sleeps with her after showing her the entire operations of their weed-dealing business. He wakes to find Emma gone, and discovers she is the boss of Pouncy House, and has stolen their computer, client lists, dealing routes, and other valuable information. At Doug's office, an SEC worker is tasked with evaluating the SEC's pension funds in order to see if they are being mismanaged, and overhears Doug and a fellow worker discussing a large sum of money being taken. The police call to say that Shane has been arrested, and Nancy goes to the police department to speak with a detective. She returns to Andy's bike shop to find that Andy has kidnapped Emma at nail- gun point and is threatening to shoot her. Nancy sends Andy away, gives Emma a stern talking to, but leaves Silas and Emma to work it out. Returning to the police station, Nancy informs the detective that Shane was only looking out for his brother, who has started dating a girl involved with Pouncy House. The detective offers to help Nancy by making a drug bust on Pouncy House in order to scare Shane straight, and to help Nancy keep her boys out of trouble. Nancy tells Demetri she has solved their ongoing weed sales problem. Silas and Emma resolve to partner up. Silas gathers everyone (his delivery men, supplier Demetri, and the Pouncy House crew) to begin working out details. He calls Nancy to let her know that he also \\"has solved the problem.\\" The detective raids Pouncy House. Emma and others from Pouncy House are arrested and Shane is brought along to experience the bust. When the detective calls Shane by his last name in front of Emma, she discovers the Botwin family's involvement in the bust. Silas, furious with Nancy, accuses her of being a control freak and breaks his partnership with her to form his own business. Nancy steals Silas' front man and his modeling connections, while Silas convinces Andy to briefly side with him and attempts to negotiate with Demetri behind Nancy's back, but Nancy overhears Silas' plans. When Silas tells Emma that he was not involved in the drug bust, she believes him, reforms their partnership, and agrees to let him move in with her. But she tells the NYPD that Silas was never involved with Pouncy House and that Nancy only reported them to eliminate her competition. The detective confronts Shane after learning the truth and tells him that he will make Shane's life a living hell because the Botwins used the NYPD as their drug muscle. After learning that Nancy and Silas are on opposing sides, Demetri convinces a gang of his \\"bored\\" military friends to intercept Silas' next MILF delivery from Heylia, without telling Nancy of his plan. Heylia and Dean make the delivery and are robbed at gunpoint by Demetri's men. Nancy learns of the robbery and realizes that the rivalry has gone too far. She tells Demetri to give back the shipment and attempts to call Silas and reconcile. After learning of the robbery from Heylia and Dean, Silas is infuriated and realizes that Nancy only cares about herself, her weed, and in a moment of clarity, realizes that she also cares about Stevie. Silas sees Stevie as Nancy's weakness and calls Jill, summoning her to New York to collect evidence about Nancy's drug business to use against her in court. As Jill arrives in New York, Nancy receives a call from the judge informing her that she will most likely get custody of Stevie. Nancy returns home to find Jill at her computer downloading her customer database. Jill tells Nancy that she knows about the drug business and threatens to report her and have her sent back to prison if she doesn't sign over custody of Stevie. Nancy refuses and Jill accompanies her to Demetri's apartment to get the stolen MILF and deliver it to Silas. When they arrive, they find Demetri's crew of robbers in his apartment. The crew is \\"baked\\" and tells Nancy that Demetri was busted in an unrelated crime and sent to prison. Nancy takes the shipment from the apartment concealed in a giant stuffed gorilla wearing an Army T-shirt. After a conversation with Andy, Silas regrets calling Jill and realizes that he has taken the rivalry between him and Nancy too far. Jill is still insistent that Nancy sign over custody, but Andy intervenes and resolves the issue by getting everyone to agree to live together in Connecticut. Several months later, the new \\"Botwin, Price-Gray\\" estate (with a little financial help from Doug) is launched in Connecticut with a family dinner. Shane returns home from police academy training, hides his police academy hat, and lies to Nancy about why he was late for dinner, saying his art history class ran late. As the season finale closes, the family sits at the table eating. The camera changes to a view through a rifle scope. The cross hairs pan around the table, finally settling on Nancy's head. The screen goes black as a shot is fired.

Prelude In October, 1849, James White, a merchant who plied his trade between Independence, Missouri, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, was traveling west with a wagon train led by a well- known wagon master, Fran√ßois Xavier Aubry. After the wagon train passed what was considered the dangerous part of the trip, it encamped. White, \\"a veteran of the trail\\", along with his wife Ann and baby daughter and \\"negro servant\\",Duffus, R.L.

After a few days of traveling by themselves, they paused at a well- known landmark called the Point of Rocks,Tiller, Veronica E.

Massacre On October 27, the group was approached by a band of Jicarillas and Utes, who according to the natives' later account, asked for presents. They were driven away from the camp, but returned again to ask, and their request received the same response. The third time they returned, they attacked the settlers. All except Ann White, her child, and her servant were killed. Some of the attackers left with their prisoners, while the others hid around what was left of the wagons. Shortly after a group of Mexicans came upon the scene. As they began to pick through what was left of the wagon train, the Apaches and Utes attacked them, killing or driving them away, but leaving a wounded Mexican boy. He was eventually discovered by a group of Americans, who first raised the alarm about the massacre.Davis, W.W.W., \\"El Gringo:Or New Mexico and Her People, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1857, pp. 44-46 Soldiers arrived at the site and buried the dead, who had, in an unusual turn, not been scalped.

From there, Captain William Grier and the 1st Cavalry were dispatched to try to rescue Mrs. White and to \\"chastise\\" the natives. They were accompanied by two experienced guides, Antoine Leroux and Robert Fisher. Along the way, they stopped at Reyado where Kit Carson joined them, eventually leading them to the spot where the attack had occurred. From there, the party pursued the natives \\"for ten or twelve days, the most difficult trail I ever followed.\\"Carson, Kit, edited by Milo Milton Quaife, University of Nebraska Press, 1966 reprint of 1935 edition, p. 132 Finally, the trackers came upon the unsuspecting natives on the banks of the Canadian River near Tucumcari Butte. Catching them unaware, Carson, who was in the lead, moved towards the camp, motioning the others to follow. In his autobiography, Carson describes what followed: \\"I was in advance, starting for their camp, calling for the men to follow. The [commanding] officer called a halt, none of them would follow me. I was informed that Leroux, the principle guide, told the officer in command, to halt, that the Indians wanted to have a parley. The Jicarillas started packing their goods for flight and a shot was fired that struck Captain Grier, causing no serious injury. (Due to the fact that Grier had a pair of heavy gauntlets tucked in his jacket) The captain ordered a charge, but the delay allowed all but one of the Indians to escape. In about 200 yards, pursuing the Indians, the body of Mrs. White was found, perfectly warm, had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow.... I am certain that if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved.\\"Carson, Kit, edited by Milo Milton Quaife, University of Nebraska Press, 1966 reprint of 1935 edition pp. 132-133 Ann White's daughter and servant were never found. In February 1850, the superintendent of Indian affairs in New Mexico, James S. Calhoun, sent Auguste Lacome, a noted scout, trader, and mountaineer, and Encarnacion Garcia, also a trader, to inquire into their location and whether they could be ransomed. Lacome met with Utes affiliated with the Jicarilla Apache and confirmed that the child had been killed shortly after the attack on the camp and her body thrown in a river. The servant was killed a short time later, being unable to keep up with the band.Calhoun, James S., collected and edited by Annie Heloise Abel, \\"The Official Correspondence of James S Calhoun While Indian Agent at Santa F√© and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico\\", 1915 Washington Government Printing Office, pp. 168-170 References Category:Apache Wars Category:New Mexico Territory Category:Massacres by Native Americans Category:Conflicts in 1849 Category:1849 in New Mexico Territory Category:1849 in the United States Category:Battles involving the Apache Category:Battles involving the United States Category:American frontier Category:October 1849 events Category:1840s murders in the United States Category:Mass murder in 1849 ","title":"White massacre"},{"id":"33224032","text":"Graffiti under the bridge Young Street Bridge is a bridge in North Aberdeen, Washington.

He taught at La Trobe University from 1968 until his retirement in 2006, edited Historical StudiesAustralia's leading historical journalfrom 1977 to 1980, and also served on the boards of Film Australia and the National Museum of Australia. He has been described as an \\"historian, public intellectual, and active citizen\\". He wrote widely on Australian history and society, publishing two well-received books about colonial New South Wales. Hirst also frequently published opinion pieces in the media. Biography Born in Adelaide, Hirst attended Unley High School and undertook his undergraduate and postgraduate study at the University of Adelaide. Abandoning an early desire to become a Methodist minister, in 1968 he was appointed a lecturer at Melbourne's new La Trobe University, where he remained until the end of his career. His wife and fellow-student Christine accompanied him to Melbourne. They had two children, Catherine and David. Hirst was subsequently head of department and Reader in History at La Trobe. He retired in 2006, and was an Emeritus Scholar at La Trobe until his death. Hirst was seconded to the University of Melbourne to edit Historical Studies, Australia's leading historical journal, from 1977 to 1980. In retirement, he travelled regularly to Sydney to instruct, without remuneration, groups of post-graduate students in thesis writing. Hirst died on 3 February 2016 at the age of 73. Academic contribution Hirst's career included \\"teaching, supervision and research. He developed new subjects and methodologies to teach them.\\" He produced a large number of articles, chapters and books on Australian history. His academic interests were wide-ranging, including social, cultural and political history. Jeremy Sammut has described him as \\"an elegant and outstanding stylist, as adept at clarifying complex issues by reducing them to their essentials as he was at crafting the pithy line that eliminated all doubt his interpretation was true and correct\\". In his historical work, Hirst's colleague at La Trobe University, Alan Frost, has noted that Hirst \\"challenged orthodoxies and produced many new insights\\". Hirst wrote two seminal books on colonial New South Wales which Frank Bongiorno has described as displaying \\"a raw intellectual power\\": Convict Society and its Enemies (1983) and The Strange Birth of Colonial Democracy (1988) (both reprinted as Freedom on the Fatal Shore in 2008). Convict Society and its Enemies was particularly influential, arguing that rather than being a brutal slave society, early New South Wales was a place where rights and freedoms were well-established from the beginning. Hirst's study of Federation, The Sentimental Nation, was also a ground-breaking work, arguing that national sentiment was more important than economics in uniting the nation. Alan Frost has described Hirst's shorter analyses as notable: \\"Distance in Australia: Was It a Tyrant?\\" (1975), his response to Geoffrey Blainey's most famous concept, \\"deserves much more attention than it now receives\\"; \\"Egalitarianism\\" (1986) challenges \\"received wisdom about colonial life\\". Many of his best shorter pieces were collected in Sense and Nonsense in Australian History (2009). A major achievement of Hirst's was a project to index the Melbourne Argus newspaper (1860‚Äì1909). In addition to those concerning Australian history, there was his pioneering course designed to inform students about Australia's European cultural heritage. This was published as The Shortest History of Europe and has been translated into twelve languages (Italianhttps://www.bompiani.it/catalogo/breve-storia- delleuropa-9788845293559 Breve Storia dell'Europa, edito nel 2017 da Bompiani nella collana Storia Paperback, traduzione di Rino Serv√π, pp. 247, Finnish, Swedish, Greek, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Korean). His last work was a similar encapsulation of Australian history in one short volume, Australian History in Seven Questions. Public intellectual Historian Frank Bongiorno described Hirst as a \\"creative historian capable of engaging a wide audience, as well as a public intellectual who delighted, infuriated and provoked\\". He contributed many opinion pieces and commentaries to Australian newspapers and journals. Jeremy Sammut has noted that Hirst was motivated by an independent mind and a distaste for unthinking conformity. He \\"defied simplistic categorisation as a partisan because his politics were idiosyncratic\\". Sammut wrote Hirst was committed \\"the rigorous pursuit of historical truth that drove him to explore the deeper patterns and meanings of the past, and the contemporary implications, that others had missed or misled us about\\". Hirst described himself as an old-fashioned social democrat. Public appointments Hirst held a number of appointments during his career. He was a member of the Prime Minister's Republic Advisory Committee, the chair of the Commonwealth Civics Education Group, a member of the Film Australia Board, a council member of the National Museum of Australia, and a member of the board of Old Parliament House in Canberra. He wrote the official history of Australia for new citizens and took a prominent part in the history summit convened by Prime Minister John Howard in 2006. Hirst advised the Victorian Government on the school history curriculum and was history adviser to the National Curriculum Authority. He was elected to the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 1986. A committed republican, Hirst was the Convenor of the Republican Movement in Victoria.

Tickera is also known as \\"The Crab Capital of the Spencer Gulf\\". It is known as the crab capital because many fishermen fish for crabs in Tickera. While fishing for crabs it is common for small sharks to follow fishermen in order to steal the crabs from the net. The shores are very shallow. It was surveyed in 1882, but experienced neither significant growth nor stability until the early 1970s. At this time, people started considering Tickera for holiday home purchases and retirement prospects.SA Memory > Tickera State Library of South Australia. Accessed 2014-04-02. History The Tickera school opened in 1887, but the first teacher resigned on 30 September 1887 and the new teacher was not appointed until May 1892. There was another school at the locality of Brucefield half- way from the town of Tickera to Alford. The Inspector-General considered that Tickera and Brucefield schools were too close to both be supported by the Education Department. The school at Brucefield opened as \\"Tickera West\\" in 1883 and changed name to \\"Brucefield\\" in 1885. It closed in 1886. As there were only nine students at Brucefield at the time, the Minister for Education did not feel justified to appoint a replacement teacher. There was community discussion about which school should be kept. The Tickera school closed in 1933. A Methodist church was built in 1889. The Tickera Hotel opened in September 1884, but was closed in October 1905 when it was purchased by the temperance movement.

(retrieved 26 September 2011) a time known as the Late Woodland Period. Archaeologists defined the culture based on the Toltec Mounds siteOdell 185 and named it for a local waterway. Relationship to other cultures The Baytown culture (300 to 650 CE) preceded the Plum Bayou culture, and was then followed by early Mississippian cultures, which flourished from 900‚Äî1600 CE, until diseases brought by Europeans decimated their populations. The Plum Bayou culture had contact with the Coles Creek culture, located along the Mississippi River, and early Caddoan cultures, located in river valleys of the Red, Ouachita, and Arkansas Rivers in Arkansas and into Oklahoma. Exotic materials found at Plum Bayou sites reveal trade with the Ozark Plateau, West Gulf Coastal Plain, and the Ouachita Mountains. Major Plum Bayou sites with single or multiple mounds include: *Baytown Site *Chandler Landing Site, Prairie County *Coy Site *Dogtown Site *Hayes Site *Maberry Site, Woodruff County *Roland Site *Toltec Mounds Settlements Toltec Mounds Site Plum Bayou culture was one of the earliest groups to build ceremonial community centers with platform mounds and rectangular plazas. They primarily lived in small villages in the uplands and floodplains of the White and Arkansas Rivers. Archaeologists divide Plum Bayou settlements into \\"single household, multiple household, multiple household with mound, and multiple mound sites.\\" Subsistence Farmers grew crops such as amaranth, chenopodium, bottle gourd, knotweed, little barley, maygrass, squash, sunflower, and sumpweed. In some later Plum Bayou sites, maize was cultivated in small amounts. Supplementing their farming, Plum Bayou peoples also hunted game and gathered wild plants, such as cherries, grapes, plums, persimmons, and nuts. Material culture This culture is defined in part by its ceramics. Much of Plum Bayou ceramics was plainware, tempered with shells. Named types of ceramics found at Plum Bayou sites include Coles Creek incised var. Keyo, Larto Red, Officer Punctated, and French Fork incised.\\"Notice of Inventory Completion: Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism, Arkansas State Parks.\\" National Park Service: Federal Register. Vol. 68, No. 228: 66,481‚Äî66,482. 26 November 2003 (retrieved 26 September 2011) Red slip, or clay paint, was also used to decorate some ceramic vessels. Decline While neighboring cultures adopted maize cultivation and increasingly complex religions and political organization, the Plum Bayou people did not. People continued to occupy the region, but they abandoned their ceremonial sites. The exact descendants of the Plum Bayou culture are not known; however, Quapaw people today are responsible for Plum Bayou human remains and artifacts through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

There is some reactive fibrosis (at right) but no consistent capsule. Colloid nodules, also known as adenomatous nodules or colloid nodular goiter are benign, noncancerous enlargement of thyroid tissue. Although they may grow large, and there may be more than one, they are not malignant and they will not spread beyond the thyroid gland. Colloid nodules are the most common kind of thyroid nodule. Presentation Colloid nodules are usually small enough to be undetectable without an ultrasound or other imaging techniques. They usually produce no symptoms, so patients are unlikely to notice them until their size makes them easier to detect. Like other thyroid nodules, they are usually first noticed in a routine physical examination. Diagnosis Colloid nodules may be initially identified as an unspecified kind of thyroid nodule. Follow-up examinations typically include an ultrasound if it's unclear whether or not there really is a nodule present. Once the presence of a nodule has been confirmed, the determination of the kind of thyroid nodule is done by fine needle aspiration biopsy. Colloid nodules are distinguished by an apparently gelatinous mass of colloid both surrounding and contained within follicular cells.

Williams Station was a combination saloon, general store and stagecoach station located along the Carson River at the modern-day Lahontan Reservoir. On May 6, 1860, Williams Station was raided by Paiutes while its owner was away. There are conflicting versions as to why an Indian war party killed all the white men and burned Williams Station. Upset at the encroachment of whites, the Utes decided to ally with a large Shoshone band and massacre all the whites.Daily National Democrat (Marysville, California) 15 May 1860, Page 2. When James O. Williams returned he found his two brothers' bodies mutilated and tortured, as well as all the patrons of the saloon murdered. After killing the men and burning the station, the Indian War party marked their trail with blood. Williams discovered that the two homes across the river of settler families (13 people) were likewise murdered. Further during the last fight at Pyramid Lake bodies of several parties of unarmed prospectors were also found to have been murdered. Likewise the Pony Express Station at Cold Creek was raided by Indians at this time, killing the innkeeper and running off all the stock. The deaths of the white settlers led to great panic with nearby Virginia City, Nevada. A local militia force was quickly assembled under the leadership of William Ormsby. Ormsby was defeated at the first Battle of Pyramid Lake which in turn led to a second, more sizeable, force led by John C. Hays to be assembled. Hays' force returned to the site of Williams Station and won a small victory there before being united with U.S. Regular Army forces under Joseph Stewart. The site of the Williams Station massacre has been submerged beneath Lahontan Reservoir since 1905.

Bordered on the north by Springdale, the lake was created as a water supply for the City of Fayetteville, but now serves as recreational lake surrounded by residential neighborhoods and as a focal point along the Razorback Regional Greenway for cyclists and trail users throughout Northwest Arkansas. History Lake Fayetteville was used as a water supply for Fayetteville until the creation of Beaver Water District, a regional provider whose source is Beaver Lake. The Clear Creek watershed contains rapidly developing areas of both cities; as a result, stormwater washes sediment and dissolved nutrients into Lake Fayetteville, including nitrogen and phosphorus. The lake has undergone eutrophication, and occasionally has toxic algal blooms. Amenities Lake Fayetteville has a marina operated by the City of Fayetteville and fishing piers. The lake contains bass, crappie, carp, bluegill, and catfish. Trail along the dam The lake has long had a nature trail around the lake, including passing through the Botanical Garden of the Ozarks. The Lake Fayetteville Nature Trail is a dirt path with tree markers passing through the oak-hickory forest typical of the Ozark Mountains. The first segment of paved trail connecting to the Razorback Regional Greenway was completed in 2007, with a full paved trail around the lake completed in 2013. The nature trail was rehabilitated and expanded into a mountain biking trail beginning in 2010.

After Riley's father was initially accused and then cleared by DNA evidence, paroled convict Scott Eby confessed to the crime and was convicted. Disappearance On June 6, 2004, the night of the disappearance, Riley's father Kevin Fox had picked up his children from their grandmother's house around 1 am. Too tired to carry his children up to bed, he laid Riley on the couch and Riley's older brother Tyler on the living room chair. He then went to his room, watched TV and went to sleep around 2:30. The next morning he was awakened by Tyler, who told him that Riley was gone. After searching and checking with neighbors, he called police. Discovery of body Later that day Riley was found dead in Forsythe Woods County Forest Preserve, a public park a few miles from Wilmington. She was found face down in a creek, having been bound, gagged, and sexually assaulted before being drowned. Investigation The girl's father, Kevin Fox, was initially charged based on a coerced confession. He spent eight months in jail before being cleared by DNA evidence showing that someone else had committed the crime. Fox's attorney Kathleen Zellner was responsible for discovering that DNA evidence existed and getting it tested. Police had found a pair of mud-covered shoes at the scene with the name Eby written inside, but did nothing with this evidence. They ignored other important clues as well, such as on the night Riley disappeared, a nearby house was burglarized. The Fox family later won a $15.5 million jury verdict (later reduced to $8.5 million) in a federal civil rights lawsuit against Will County Sheriff's Office and the detectives who had coerced Kevin Fox's confession. Scott Eby was later charged on five counts of first-degree murder and one count of predatory sexual assault after DNA evidence linked him to Riley. At the time he was charged, Eby was serving two consecutive seven-year sentences. Eby confessed that he burglarized a nearby home, then cut through a screen door of Riley's home. He found Riley on the couch, put her into his car, and drove her to the park where he assaulted her in a restroom. Then he drowned her in a nearby creek. He received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. He had been on parole and living about a mile from the Fox's home at the time of the crime.

She was one of the few witnesses of the killing of four Nationalists committed by local police officers in Puerto Rico during a confrontation with the supporters of the Nationalist Party that occurred in October 24, 1935, and which is known as the R√≠o Piedras massacre. Rond√≥n joined the political movement and became the Treasurer of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party which staged various uprisings in Puerto Rico against the colonial Government of the United States in 1950. Early years Rond√≥n was born in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico and was raised by her upon her father's death. Her mother was a housekeeper and at times Rond√≥n helped. after Rond√≥n began her primary education in her hometown and after completing her eighth grade she attended a secretarial school.Isolina Rond√≥n She went on to study at the University of Puerto Rico where she worked in the office of the Dean of Social Sciences.Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico-FBI files Her cousin was a member of the faction of the Puerto Rican Union Party which believed in Puerto Rican independence. On September 17, 1922, three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Her cousin followed Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠, a former member of the Puerto Rican Union Party, and the founder of the nationalist Party. In 1924 Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president. El Nuevo Dia Rond√≥n was influenced by her cousins political ideals. Nationalist Rond√≥n attended the local Nationalist Party meetings with her cousin at the house of Albizu Campos in R√≠o Piedras. Together with other devotees she made daily visits to the house. Eventually Rondon was asked by Albizu Campos to take notes at the meetings and it wasn't long before Rond√≥n became his personal secretary. =R√≠o Piedras massacre= On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university began a signature collection campaign with the intention of declaring Albizu Campos \\"Student Enemy Number One\\". A protest against the group by the pro-nationalist faction of students in turn denounced Chard√≥n and the Liberal Party as instigators and agents of the United States.\\"Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcel√≥, 1868-1938\\"; by: Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia; Page 306; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); A student assembly was held at the university on Oct. 24, where Albizu Campos was declared \\"Persona non- grata\\". Chard√≥n requested that the governor provide and place armed police officers on the grounds of the university in case the situation turned violent. A couple of police officers spotted what they believed to be a suspicious looking automobile and asked the driver Ram√≥n S. Pag√°n, secretary of the Nationalist Party, who was accompanied by his friend Pedro Qui√±ones, for his license. A fight between the men in the car and the police soon followed which resulted in the death of Pag√°n and Qui√±ones. According to the local newspaper \\"El Mundo\\" of Oct. 25th, an explosion, followed by gunfire, was heard resulting in the additional deaths of Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Vega and Jos√© Santiago Barea. Rond√≥n watched from her front door on Calle Brumbaugh, near the University of Puerto Rico, as the police shot into the car carrying the four Nationalists. Rond√≥n, testified how she saw the police officers shooting at the victims and how she heard one police officer screaming \\"do not to let them escape alive\\". However, her testimony, as to the incident which became known as the R√≠o Piedras massacre, was ignored and there were no charges raised against the officers. They were instead given a promotion. That same year, Albizu Campos was arrested and sent to Atlanta Penitentiary. =Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s= On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a On October 30, 1950, on the orders of Albizu Campos, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party staged various uprisings, in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, in various towns, among them Pe√±uelas, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo and Ponce, of which the most notable occurrences being in Utuado uprising, where the insurgents were massacred, Jayuya uprising, the town where the \\"Free Republic of Puerto Rico\\" was declared, and which was heavily damaged by the military in response to the insurrection, and in San Juan where the Nationalists made an attempt against then-Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n at his residence \\"La Fortaleza\\". The uprisings failed and hundreds of Nationalists were rounded up and arrested. On April 15, 1952, she was interviewed by the FBI in her Rio Piedras apartment in regard to the uprisings. She stated that she had been treasurer of the Nationalist Party from 1936 to 1946. Rond√≥n also stated that any actions taken by the party were a result of the inspiration of Albizu Campos. On May 20, she was asked if Albizu Campos used any of the Party's funds for himself and she stated no, she also insisted that any questions in regard to the Nationalist Party should be directed at Albizu Campos, since he is the spokesperson of the party's ideals. She was then asked if Albizu Campos gave the order that resulted in the Nationalist Uprisings of October 30, 1950 and she responded that Albizu Campos was unaware of many of the actions which involved the Nationalists. She stated that to the best of her knowledge Albizu Campos had nothing to do with the uprisings. Later years Isolina Rond√≥n continued to be active in Puerto Rico's Independent movement. She acted as the Secretary of the Nationalist Party. She died on October 2, 1990 in New York City.Social Security Records There is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

It was conducted between 1986 and 1989 and included over 1700 patients in 27 centres. The study found that the tested drugs increased mortality instead of lowering it as was expected. The publication of these results in 1991/92, in combination with large follow-up studies for drugs that had not been tested in CAST, led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of MI patients. Class I and III antiarrhythmics are now only used with extreme caution after MI, or they are contraindicated completely. Heart Rhythm Society Distinguished Scientist D. George Wyse was a member of the CAST trial's steering and executive committees. Background The study was prompted by the fact that patients who suffer from myocardial infarctions (MIs) have a high risk of sudden death, presumably due to arrhythmia. Around the time of the study onset (1986), an estimated 8 to 15% of patients would die in the subsequent year following an MI, with about half of those deaths resulting from arrhythmia. This warranted the investigation as to whether PVC suppression could improve outcomes in post-MI patients. The trial was conducted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Study design CAST was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized to drug therapy or placebo if they met these criteria: They had a myocardial infarction occurring six days to two years prior to the onset of the study, and they had asymptomatic ventricular premature beats, detected by Holter monitor, which could be suppressed by either encainide, flecainide, or moracizine in an open- label design. A total of 1727 subjects who responded were randomized, 1455 to encainide, flecainide, or placebo, and 272 to moracizine or placebo. The primary endpoint was sudden cardiac death, and the secondary endpoint was all- cause mortality. The second Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST II) modified the enrollment criteria to include patients at higher risk for serious arrhythmia. This included 1) patients enrolled within 4 to 90 days of a previous MI, 2) a left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 40%, 3) prior to enrollment, suppression of PVCs had occurred with the drugs (vs. placebo) using a double-blinded design, and 4) patients having more serious arrhythmias would also be included. Results The drugs used (encainide, flecainide, and moracizine) successfully reduced the amount of PVCs, but led to more arrhythmia-related deaths. Total mortality was significantly higher with both encainide and flecainide at a mean follow-up period of 10 months. Within about two years after enrollment, encainide and flecainide were discontinued because of increased mortality and sudden cardiac death. CAST II compared moracizine to placebo, but was also stopped because of early (within two weeks) cardiac death in the moracizine group, and long-term survival seemed highly unlikely. The excess mortality was attributed to proarrhythmic effects of the agents. Class I antiarrhythmics are proarrhythmic during heart ischemia in animals.

While no timetable has been announced for its construction, it has the provisional name .  Overview  Of the nine planned subway lines in Osaka subway, this is the only one that has not yet started any construction. If it is constructed as planned, it would be the only other subway line apart from the Imazatosuji Line to pass completely outside the Osaka Loop Line. Line 9's planned route is in the southern part of Osaka city (specifically, Suminoe-ku, Sumiyoshi-ku, Higashisumiyoshi-ku, and Hirano-ku). Despite the high volume of road traffic, it has relatively inconvenient east-west mass transit compared to other parts of Osaka: most buses divert from the route at Sentai or Nagai, requiring several transfers to go any significant distance. As a result, the construction of this line has long been the hope of area residents. Apart from its planned route (under Nagaik≈çen-d≈çri) and connecting stations already existing (or planned) on other lines, relatively little is set in stone. An automated guideway transit system (effectively an extension of the Nank≈ç Port Town Line) was initially suggested, but space considerations mean that the line, if built, will likely be a more traditional underground railway utilizing narrow cross-section, linear motor-powered trains like those on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line and Imazatosuji Line.  Construction prospects  In the 10th report of the Transport Policy Committee in 1989, it was listed as a , but it was not included in the list of in the October 2004 report of the Kinki Regional Transport Committee. With both Osaka and its Municipal Transportation Bureau being in the middle of a very tight financial situation, the planned southern extension of the Imazatosuji Line has been postponed indefinitely; under these conditions, it seems unlikely that another line passing completely outside the city center, without any major passenger draw along its route, and with little foreseeable demand outside of morning and evening rush hour, will stand much chance of completion in the near-term. Even in the planning stages, it was not anticipated to become profitable. Because of these factors, it has only been planned in broad strokes, and debate about its finer details has yet to occur. Furthermore, as the Municipal Transportation Bureau was privatized in 2017, it is possible that its ultimate fate will be decided by Osaka Rapid Electric Tramway, K.K. (known as Osaka Metro).

Maria Angela Biasiotti, Jeanne Pia Mifsud Bonnici, Joe Cannataci, Fabrizio Turchi (editors) as does the website, http://www.evidenceproject.eu/categorization Electronic evidence Electronic evidence can be abbreviated as e-evidence, and this shorter term is gaining in acceptance in Continental Europe. This page covers mainly activity there and on the international level.  Access to electronic evidence  Access is the area where much of the current activity on the international level is taking place. A network called the Internet & Jurisdiction Policy Network holds global conferences on the topic at various locations.especially its Data and Jurisdiction Work Plan on pp. 6 ff. of its 2018 Ottawa Roadmap Here are three key regional developments in Geneva, Strasbourg and Brussels. = International Organization for Standardization (ISO) = There is an international forensic standard issued by ISO with the International Electrical Commission ISO/IEC 27037. = United Nations= Late in 2019 Russia and China initiated a move to consider drafting a global cybercrime convention. Western democracies are conspicuously absent from the sponsoring parties. Many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have issued a protest letter claiming the Russian initiative would potentially infringe upon human rights. = Council of Europe = The Convention on Cybercrime (‚ÄúBudapest Convention‚Äù) is \\"the first international treaty on crimes committed via the Internet\\". The CoE is currently drafting an update in the form of a second additional protocol to the Convention. An international group of national data protection authorities with a secretariat in Germany called the International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications is monitoring the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention holding 60-some meetings on the access problem, most recently to address events in Brazil, Belgium and China in addition to the Microsoft Ireland case. The draft protocol has proven quite controversial. A joint civil society statement has been submitted. \\"The Cybercrime Convention Committee has extended the negotiations of the protocol to December 2020.\\" Meanwhile there are the guidelines from 2019. = European Union = The European Parliament has been developing the so-called ‚Äúe-evidence package‚Äù, which is summarized as \\"stops\\" in this legislative \\"train schedule\\". The process is complex with both the Commission and Council producing parallel text drafts. In early 2020 there will be a vote in LIBE committee, probably combined with a mandate to begin trilogues. More specifically, the LIBE Committee's report will be submitted to the Plenary of the Parliament for adoption. It is only after this step that the trilogues between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission could start in order to agree on a common text. The rapporteur Birgit Sippel MEP has released her report proposing changes to the versions of the Commission and the Council. The report has given rise to both a summary and a more detailed commentary analysing its provisions for their efficiency and protection of human rights. In February 2019, the European Commission recommended \\"engaging in two international negotiations on cross-border rules to obtain electronic evidence,\\" one involving the USA and one on the CoE. Indeed, the USA/EU axis and the CoE are the scenes of work on these issues, as described and compared in a 2019 paper advocating a revamping of the Mutual legal assistance treaty, page 17. The reason for the above development was given as due to the fact that \\"[i]n the offline world, authorities can request and obtain documents necessary to investigate a crime within their own country, but electronic evidence is stored online by service providers often based in a different country than [sic] the investigator, even if the crime is only in one country.\\" The Commission then gave data supporting this decision. Indeed, this is the reason for treating electronic evidence differently from the ways that other evidence is treated. Moreover, it may expedite convergence or some form of reconciliation between the world's two main legal systems, i.e. common law and civil law, at least as regards this use case. Negotiations are set to begin. Working documents are documents relating to the drafting of reports and opinions. These describe the proposed core instruments to handle cross-border requests: a European Production Order (EPOC) and a European Preservation Order (EPOC-PR). The framework for those instruments is the European evidence warrant. Separately from the above, a dedicated convention has been drafted by a British barrister. =United Kingdom= The UK government announced that the new \\"UK-US Bilateral Data Access Agreement will dramatically speed up investigations and prosecutions by enabling law enforcement, with appropriate authorisation, to go directly to the tech companies to access data, rather than through governments, which can take years.\\" \\"It gives effect to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019, which received Royal Assent in February this year and was facilitated by the CLOUD Act in America, passed last year.\\" \\"The Agreement does not change anything about the way companies can use encryption and does not stop companies from encrypting data.\\" On encryption, the US, UK and Australia are contacting Facebook directly The agreement means that UK officials can now apply to the US via the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019.The Act is here, and Explanatory Notes to the Act are available from a tab. =United States= The basis for obtaining cross- border access is the Stored Communications Act as amended by the CLOUD Act. A new agreement with the UK was negotiated and it \\"will enter into force following a six-month Congressional review period mandated by the CLOUD Act, and the related review by UK‚Äôs Parliament.\\"  Controversy One of the most controversial cases brought yet to a court has been the 2013 Microsoft Corp. v. United States case. Potential conflicts between the EU regime and the US CLOUD Act have led legal scholars Jennifer Daskal and Peter Swire to propose a US/EU agreement. Those authors have also assembled a set of FAQ seeking to address questions specifically that have arisen from the European Union in connection with the CLOUD Act. Highlighting differences from the status quo, the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs commissioned a study and held a hearing; the study is available. Europeans discussing ‚ÄòCo-operating in the Digital Age‚Äô in the Internet Governance Forum have been critical of the EU's proposals, fearing that \\"companies and businesses [might] implement stronger filtering and blocking mechanisms in order to avoid sanctions or reputational damages.\\" Later in November at the Internet Governance Forum 2019 in Berlin panelists described new initiatives in Brazil and Russia respectively. Some problems quite different from those in the Microsoft case alluded to above have been found and described in an article in the German weekly ZEIT dated 19 December 2018 with 167 comments on the proposed direct access tracks described above under \\"European Union\\"; the journalist Martin Klingst entitled it \\"Nackt per Gesetz\\" (Naked by Law, meaning exposed to foreign observation by domestic law). Klingst is appalled at the thought that an EU member state like Hungary might demand his data. Apparently Katharina Barley, German Federal Minister of Justice, agrees. Germany has protections against infringements on one's \\"informational self-determination\\" that are the strongest of any EU member state. The European Arrest Warrant is another example of the national limits placed on EU rights in some conditions. Besides, Klingst sees a contradiction between having Internet companies be the guardians of right and wrong, whereas in a new draft German law they might be punished themselves. Would other MSs respect Germany's interpretation of who maintains confidentiality? he asks rhetorically. E-evidence could become the first case, Klingst predicts, testing whether Germany's top judges have reserved enough room for the most basic protections. Much evidence is plain text; but some evidence is encrypted. In 2015 and 2016, another chapter was added to the long-standing encryption controversy with the FBI-Apple encryption dispute. That controversy continues in 2019 with multiple nation-states pressuring Facebook to put a backdoor in its messenger service.

It has a thin, fleshy brown flowering stem and up to twenty five drooping, brownish, self-pollinating flowers that are white inside. Growing in a wide range of habitats, it is native to Australia and New Zealand. Description Gastrodia sesamoides is a leafless, terrestrial saprophyte with an underground rhizome up to long and in diameter. The thin, fleshy brown flowering stem is tall with between three and six bracts long and between three and twenty five flowers. The flowers are cinnamon brown to greyish brown and often rough on the outside, white inside with the sepals and petals joined to form a bell- shaped tube long. Each flower has a pedicel or \\"stalk\\" long and a cone-shaped ovary with the narrower end towards the base. The flowers often produce an appealing cinnamon-like scent. Flowering occurs from September to January in Australia and from August to May in New Zealand, but the flowers are self- pollinating. Flowering is enhanced by fire the previous summer. Taxonomy and naming Gastrodia sesamoides was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in his book Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet (sesamoides) refers to a supposed similarity to the sesame plant, the ending -oides being a Latin suffix meaning \\"like\\", \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\".  Distribution and habitat Cinnamon bells is widespread and common, occurring south from the Darling Downs through the eastern half of New South Wales and the southern half of Victoria to Tasmania. It used to be found in the Sydney region but is now considered rare or extinct in that area. It is only found in the far southeast of South Australia, including on Kangaroo Island. It occurs on both the North and South Islands of New Zealand although only in the Marlborough and Nelson areas of the South Island. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, including forest and coastal scrub from lowland areas to subalpine habitats as long as there is adequate rainfall or soil moisture. In New Zealand it is often found in forestry plantations and in gardens where pine bark mulch is used. Ecology Because the potato orchid doesn‚Äôt produce chlorophyll it is unable to make its own food via photosynthesis. Alternatively, it has a complex relationship with a fungus. The orchid receives its nutrients from the fungus, and the fungus obtains its habitat from the orchid and minerals and sugars from the roots of other forest trees. Gastrodia sesamoides has been introduced to and is naturalised in South Africa. Conservation This orchid is common and widespread throughout most of its range but is classed as \\"rare\\" in South Australia. Uses =Use as food= Indigenous Australians ate the roasted tubers of this orchid and it may have been one of the principal plants used by Tasmanian Aborigines. An early Victorian settler reported that Aboriginal peoples located the plants in habitat by observing where bandicoots had scratched in search of the tubers after detecting the plants underground by scent. The flavour of the tuber is said to resemble that of the beetroot, though insipid and watery. =Use in horticulture= Cultivation of all species of Gastrodia is impossible.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services defines welfare dependency as the proportion of all individuals in families which receive more than 50 percent of their total annual income from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, and/or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence Typically viewed as a social problem, it has been the subject of major welfare reform efforts since the mid-20th century, primarily focused on trying to make recipients self- sufficient through paid work. While the term \\"welfare dependency\\" can be used pejoratively, for the purposes of this article it shall be used to indicate a particular situation of persistent poverty. Discourses of dependency and the history of a social problem =Terminology= The term \\"welfare dependency\\" is itself controversial, often carrying derogatory connotations or insinuations that the recipient is unwilling to work. Historian Michael B. Katz discussed the discourses surrounding poverty in his 1989 book The Undeserving Poor, where he elaborated upon the distinctions Americans make between so-called ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù recipients of aid, such as widows, and ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù ones, like single-parent mothers, with the distinction being that the former have fallen upon hard times through no fault of their own whereas the latter are seen as having chosen to live on the public purse.Katz, M. (1989) The Undeserving Poor: From the War on Poverty to the War of Welfare. New York: Pantheon Books. Drawing this dichotomy diverts attention from the structural factors that cause and entrench poverty, such as economic change. Instead of focusing on how to tackle the root causes of poverty, people focus on attacking the supposed poor character of the recipient. It is important to note that while the term ‚Äúwelfare dependence‚Äù in and of itself is politically neutral and merely describes a state of drawing benefits, in conventional usage it has taken on a very negative meaning that blames welfare recipients for social ills and insinuates they are morally deficient. In his 1995 book The War Against the Poor, Columbia University sociology professor Herbert Gans asserted that the label ‚Äúwelfare recipient,‚Äù when used to malign a poor person, transforms the individual‚Äôs experience of being in poverty into a personal failing while ignoring positive aspects of their character. For example, Gans writes, ‚ÄúThat a welfare recipient may be a fine mother becomes irrelevant; the label assumes that she, like all others in her family, is a bad mother, and she is given no chance to prove otherwise.‚Äù Gans (1995), p. 12 In this way, structural factors that cause a person to be reliant on benefit payments for the majority of his or her income are in essence ignored because the problem is seen as situated within the person, not society. To describe a person as welfare dependent can therefore be interpreted as \\"blaming the victim,\\" depending on context. The term \\"welfare-reliant,\\" as used by Edin and Lein (1996), can describe the same concept with potentially fewer negative connotations. =Welfare, long-term reliance, and policy= There is a great deal of overlap between discourses of welfare dependency and the stereotype of the welfare queen, in that long-term welfare recipients are often seen as draining public resources they have done nothing to earn, as well as stereotyped as doing nothing to improve their situation, choosing to draw benefits when there are alternatives available. This contributes to stigmatization of welfare recipients. While the stereotype of a long-term welfare recipient involves not wanting to work, in reality a large proportion of welfare recipients are engaged in some form of paid work but still cannot make ends meet. Attention was drawn to the issue of long-term reliance on welfare in the Moynihan Report. Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued that in the wake of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, urban Black Americans would still suffer disadvantage and remain entrenched in poverty due to the decay of the family structure.Office of Policy Planning and Research, United States Department of Labor (1965). The Negro Family: The Case for National Action. Moynihan wrote, ‚ÄúThe steady expansion of welfare programs can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the Negro family structure over the past generation in the United States.‚Äù The relatively high proportion of Black families headed by single-parent mothers, along with the high proportion of children born out of wedlock, was seen as a pernicious social problem ‚Äì one leading to long-term poverty and consequently reliance on welfare benefits for income, as there would be no male breadwinner working while the mother took care of her children. From 1960 to 1975, both the percentage of families headed by single-parent mothers and reliance on welfare payments increased. At the same time, research began indicating that the majority of people living below the poverty line experienced only short spells of poverty, casting doubt on the notion of an entrenched underclass. For example, a worker who lost his job might be categorized as poor for a few months prior to re-entering full-time employment, and he or she would be much less likely to end up in a situation of long-term poverty than a single-parent mother with little formal education, even if both were considered ‚Äúpoor‚Äù for statistical purposes. In 1983, researchers Mary Jo Bane and David T. Ellwood used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine the duration of spells of poverty (defined as continuous periods spent with income under the poverty line), looking specifically at entry and exit. They found that while three in five people who were just beginning a spell of poverty came out of it within three years, only one-quarter of people who had already been poor for three years were able to exit poverty within the next two. The probability that a person will be able to exit poverty declines as the spell lengthens. A small but significant group of recipients remained on welfare for much longer, forming the bulk of poverty at any one point in time and requiring the most in government resources. At any one time, if a cross-sectional sample of poor people in the United States was taken, about 60% would be in a spell of poverty that would last at least eight years. Interest thus arose in studying the determinants of long-term receipt of welfare. Bane & Ellwood found that only 37% of poor people in their sample became poor as a result of the head of household‚Äôs wages decreasing, and their average spell of poverty lasted less than four years. On the other hand, entry into poverty that was the result of a woman becoming head of household lasted on average for more than five years. Children born into poverty were particularly likely to remain poor. =Reform: the rise of workfare= In the popular imagination, welfare became seen as something that the poor had made into a lifestyle rather than a safety net. The federal government had been urging single-parent mothers with children to take on paid work in an effort to reduce welfare rolls since the introduction of the WIN Program in 1967, but in the 1980s this emphasis became central to welfare policy. Emphasis turned toward personal responsibility and the attainment of self-sufficiency through work. Conservative views of welfare dependency, coming from the perspective of classical economics, argued that individual behaviors and the policies that reward them lead to the entrenchment of poverty. Lawrence M. Mead's 1986 book Beyond Entitlement: The Social Obligations of Citizenship argued that American welfare was too permissive, giving out benefit payments without demanding anything from poor people in return, particularly not requiring the recipient to work. Mead viewed this as directly linked to the higher incidence of social problems among poor Americans, more as a cause than an effect of poverty: :\\"[F]ederal programs have special difficulties in setting standards for their recipients. They seem to shield their clients from the threats and rewards that stem from private society ‚Äì particularly the marketplace ‚Äì while providing few sanctions of their own. The recipients seldom have to work or otherwise function to earn whatever income, service, or benefit a program gives; meager though it may be, they receive it essentially as an entitlement. Their place in American society is defined by their need and weakness, not their competence. This lack of accountability is among the reasons why nonwork, crime, family breakup, and other problems are much commoner among recipients than Americans generally.\\"Mead, L.M. (1986). Beyond Entitlement: The Social Obligations of Citizenship. New York: Free Press. Charles Murray argued that American social policy ignored people's inherent tendency to avoid hard work and be amoral, and that from the War on Poverty onward the government had given welfare recipients disincentives to work, marry, or have children in wedlock. His 1984 book Losing Ground was also highly influential in the welfare reforms of the 1990s. In 1983, Bane & Ellwood found that one-third of single-parent mothers exited poverty through work, indicating that it was possible for employment to form a route out of reliance on welfare even for this particular group. Overall, four in five exits from poverty could be explained by an increase in earnings, according to their data. The idea of combining welfare reform with work programs in order to reduce long-term dependency received bipartisan support during the 1980s, culminating in the signing of the Family Support Act in 1988. This Act aimed to reduce the number of AFDC recipients, enforce child support payments, and establish a welfare-to-work program. One major component was the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program, which provided remedial education and was specifically targeted to teenage mothers and recipients who had been on welfare for six years or more ‚Äì those populations considered most likely to be welfare dependent. JOBS was to be administered by the states, with federal government matching up to a capped level of funding. A lack of resources, particularly in relation to financing and case management, stymied JOBS. However, in 1990, expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), first enacted in 1975, offered working poor families with children an incentive to remain in work. Also in that year, federal legislation aimed at providing child care to families who would otherwise be dependent on welfare aided single-parent mothers in particular. Welfare reform during the Clinton presidency placed time limits on benefit receipt, replacing Aid for Families with Dependent Children and the JOBS program with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and requiring that recipients begin to work after two years of receiving these payments. Such measures were intended to decrease welfare dependence: The House Ways and Means Committee stated that the goal of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act was to \\"reduce the length of welfare spells by attacking dependency while simultaneously preserving the function of welfare as a safety net for families experiencing temporary financial problems.\\"The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act and Associated Legislation This was a direct continuation of the line of thinking that had been prevalent in the 1980s, where personal responsibility was emphasized. TANF was administered by individual states, with funding coming from federal block grants. However, resources were not adjusted for inflation, caseload changes, or state spending changes.National Poverty Center: Brief Number 7. Unlike its predecessor AFDC, TANF had as its explicit goal the formation and maintenance of two-parent families and the prevention of out-of-wedlock births, reflecting the discourses that had come to surround long-term welfare receipt.ACF Office of Public Affairs http://www.acf.hhs.gov/opa/fact_sheets/tanf_factsheet.html One shortcoming of workfare-based reform was that it did not take into account the fact that, due to welfare benefits often not paying enough to meet basic needs, a significant proportion of mothers on welfare already worked \\"off the books\\" to generate extra income without losing their welfare entitlements. Neither welfare nor work alone could provide enough money for daily expenses; only by combining the two could the recipients provide for themselves and their children. Even though working could make a woman eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, the amount was not enough to make up for the rest of her withdrawn welfare benefits. Work also brought with it related costs, such as transportation and child care. Without fundamental changes in the skill profile of the average single-parent mother on welfare to address structural changes in the economy, or a significant increase in pay for low-skilled work, withdrawing welfare benefits and leaving women with only work income meant that many faced a decline in overall income. Sociologists Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein interviewed mothers on welfare in Chicago, Charleston, Boston, and San Antonio, and found that while working mothers generally had more income left over after paying rent and food than welfare mothers did, the former were still worse-off financially because of the costs associated with work. Despite strong support for the idea that work will provide the income and opportunity to help people become self-sufficient, this approach has not alleviated the need for welfare payments in the first place: In 2005, approximately 52% of TANF recipients lived in a family with at least one working adult.2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence: Executive Summary =Measuring dependency= The United States Department of Health and Human Services defines ten indicators of welfare dependency: * Indicator 1: Degree of Dependence, which can be measured by the percentage of total income from means-tested benefits. If greater than 50%, the recipient of welfare is considered to be dependent on it for the purposes of official statistics. * Indicator 2: Receipt of Means- Tested Assistance and Labor Force Attachment, or what percentage of recipients are in families with different degrees of labor force participation. * Indicator 3: Rates of Receipt of Means-Tested Assistance, or the percentage of the population receiving TANF, food stamps, and SSI. * Indicator 4: Rates of Participation in Means-Tested Assistance Programs, or the percentage of people eligible for welfare benefits who are actually claiming them. * Indicator 5: Multiple Program Receipt, or the percentage of recipients who are receiving at least two of TANF, food stamps, or SSI. * Indicator 6: Dependence Transitions, which breaks down recipients by demographic characteristics and the level of income that welfare benefits represented for them in previous years. * Indicator 7: Program Spell Duration, or for how long recipients draw the three means-tested benefits. * Indicator 8: Welfare Spell Duration with No Labor Force Attachment, which measures how long recipients with no one working in their family remain on welfare. * Indicator 9: Long Term Receipt, which breaks down spells on TANF by how long a person has been in receipt. * Indicator 10: Events Associated with the Beginning and Ending of Program Spells, such as an increase in personal or household income, marriage, children no longer being eligible for a benefit, and/or transfer onto other benefits. In 2005, the Department estimated that 3.8% of the American population could be considered dependent on welfare, calculated as having more than half of their family‚Äôs income coming from TANF, food stamps, and/or SSDI payments, down from 5.2% in 1996. As 15.3% of the population was in receipt of welfare benefits in 2005, it follows that approximately one-quarter of welfare recipients are considered dependent as per the official measures. In general, measures of welfare dependence are assessed alongside the statistics for poverty in general. Government measures of welfare dependence include welfare benefits associated with work. If such benefits were excluded from calculations, the dependency rate would be lower. 730x730px Risk factors =Demographic= Welfare dependence in the United States is typically associated with female-headed households with children.https://litigation- essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid;=1&srctype;=smi&srcid;=3B15&doctype;=cite&docid;=19+Harv.+Women's+L.J.+201&key;=e89aade25815b1960f86bfb91d565a5c Raphael, Jody (1996) \\"Domestic Violence and Welfare Receipt: Toward a New Feminist Theory of Welfare Dependency.\\" Harvard Women's Law Journal. Mothers who have never been married are more likely to stay on welfare for long periods of time than their counterparts who have ever been married, including women who became separated or divorced from their partners. In her study using data from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation, Patricia Ruggles found that 40% of never-married mothers remained on welfare for more than two years, and that while the median time spent on welfare for ever- married women was only 8 months, for never-married women it was between 17 and 18 months. Statistics from 2005 show that while only 1% of people living in married-couple families could be classified as welfare-dependent as per the government definition, 14% of people in single-parent family mothers were dependent.2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence Teenage mothers in particular are susceptible to having to rely on welfare for long periods of time because their interruption in schooling combined with the responsibilities of childrearing prevent them from gaining employment; there is no significant difference between single-parent and married teenage mothers because their partners are likely to be poor as well. While many young and/or single-parent mothers do seek work, their relatively low skill levels along with the burdens of finding appropriate childcare hurt their chances of remaining employed. Black women are more likely than their White counterparts to be lone parents, which partially explains their higher rate of welfare dependency. At the time of the Moynihan Report, approximately one-quarter of Black households were headed by women, compared to about one in ten White households. Ruggles‚Äô data analysis found that, in 1984, the median time on welfare for nonwhite recipients was just under 16 months, while for White recipients it was approximately 8 months. One year earlier, Bane & Ellwood found that the average duration of a new spell of poverty for a Black American was approximately seven years, compared to four years for Whites. In 2005, official statistics stated that 10.2% of Black Americans were welfare dependent, compared to 5.7% of Hispanics and 2.2% of non-Hispanic Whites. William Julius Wilson, in The Truly Disadvantaged, explained that a shrinking pool of ‚Äúmarriageable‚Äù Black men, thanks to increasing unemployment brought about by structural changes in the economy, leads to more Black women remaining unmarried.Wilson, W. J. (1987). The Truly Disadvantaged However, there is no evidence that welfare payments themselves provide an incentive for teenage girls to have children or for Black women to remain unmarried. There is an association between a parent's welfare dependency and that of her children; a mother's welfare participation increases the likelihood that her daughter, when grown, will also be dependent on welfare. The mechanisms through which this happens may include the child's lessened feelings of stigma related to being on welfare, lack of job opportunities because he or she did not observe a parent's participation in the labor market, and detailed knowledge of how the welfare system works imprinted from a young age. In some cases, the unemployment trap may function as a perverse incentive to remain dependent on welfare payments, as returning to work would not significantly increase household earnings as welfare benefits are withdrawn, and the associated costs and stressors would outweigh any benefits. This trap can be eliminated through the addition of work subsidies.Acs, Gregory & Toder, Eric (2006). \\"Should we subsidize work? Welfare reform, the earned income tax credit and optimal transfers.\\" International Tax and Public Finance, 14:3, 327‚Äì343. Other factors which entrench welfare dependency, particularly for women, include lack of affordable childcare, low education and skill levels, and unavailability of suitable jobs. Research has found that women who have been incarcerated also have high rates of social welfare receipt, especially if they were incarcerated in state prison rather than in county jail.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Female Offenders Use of Social Welfare Programs Before and After Jail and Prison: Does Prison Cause Welfare Dependency?, November 2006 =Structural economic factors= Kasarda and Ting (1996) argue that poor people become trapped in dependency on welfare due to a lack of skills along with spatial mismatch.Kasarda, J.D. and Ting, K. (1996). Joblessness and Poverty in America's Central Cities: Causes and Policy Prescriptions Post-WWII, American cities have produced a surplus of high- skilled jobs which are beyond the reach of most urban welfare recipients, who do not have the appropriate skills. This is in large part due to fundamental inequalities in the quality of public education, which are themselves traceable to class disparities because school funding is heavily reliant on local property taxes. Meanwhile, low-skilled jobs have decreased within the city, moving out toward more economically advantageous suburban locations. Under the spatial mismatch hypothesis, reductions in urban welfare dependence, particularly among Blacks, would rely on giving potential workers access to suitable jobs in affluent suburbs. This would require changes in policies related not only to welfare, but to housing and transportation, to break down barriers to employment. Without appropriate jobs, it can be argued using rational choice theory that welfare recipients would make the decision to do what is economically advantageous to them, which often means not taking low- paid work that would require expensive childcare and lengthy commutes. This would explain dependence on welfare over work. However, a large proportion of welfare recipients are also in some form of work, which casts doubt on this viewpoint. =The persistence of racism= One perspective argues that structural problems, particularly persistent racism, have concentrated disadvantage among urban Black residents and thus caused their need to rely on long-term welfare payments.Bay Area Social Services Consortium, Understanding Poverty from Multiple Social Science Perspectives Housing policies segregated Black Americans into impoverished neighborhoods and formally blocked avenues to quality education and high-paying employment. Economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s did not alleviate poverty, largely because wages remained stagnant while the availability of low-skilled but decent-paying jobs disappeared from American urban centers. Poverty could be alleviated by better-targeted economic policies as well as concerted efforts to penalize racial discrimination. However, William Julius Wilson, in The Truly Disadvantaged, urges caution in initiating race-based programs as there is evidence they may not benefit the poorest Black people, which would include people who have been on welfare for long periods of time. =Cultural= Oscar Lewis introduced a theory of a culture of poverty in the late 1950s, initially in the context of anthropological studies in Mexico. However, the idea gained currency and influenced the Moynihan Report. This perspective argues that poverty is perpetuated by a value system different from that of mainstream society, influenced by the material deprivation of one's surroundings and the experiences of family and friends. There are both liberal and conservative interpretations of the culture of poverty: the former argues that lack of work and opportunities for mobility have concentrated disadvantage and left people feeling as if they have no way out of their situation; the latter believe that welfare payments and government intervention normalize and incentivize relying on welfare, not working, and having children out of wedlock, and consequently transmit social norms supporting dependency to future generations. Reducing poverty or reducing dependence? Reducing poverty and reducing dependence are not equivalent terms. Cutting the number of individuals receiving welfare payments does not mean that poverty itself has been proportionally reduced, because many people with incomes below the official poverty line may not be receiving the transfer payments they may have been entitled to in previous years. For example, in the early 1980s there was a particularly large discrepancy between the official poverty rate and the number of AFDC recipients due to major government cuts in AFDC provision. As a result, many people who previously would have been entitled to welfare benefits no longer received them ‚Äì an example of increasing official measures of poverty but decreasing dependence. While official welfare rolls were halved between 1996 and 2000, many working poor families were still reliant on government aid in the form of unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and assistance with food and childcare.The Urban Institute, \\"Welfare Reform: Ten Years Later.\\" Changes in the practices surrounding the administration of welfare may obscure continuing problems with poverty and failures to change the discourse in the face of new evidence. Whereas in the 1980s and much of the 1990s discussions of problems with welfare centered on dependency, the focus in more recent years has come to rest on working poverty.O'Connor, A. (2000). \\"Poverty Research and Policy for the Post-Welfare Era.\\" Annual Review of Sociology, 26: 547-562. The behavior of this particular group of poor people has changed, but their poverty has not been eliminated. Poverty rates in the United States have risen since the implementation of welfare reform.U.S. Census Bureau: Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States. States that maintain more generous welfare benefits tend to have fewer people living below the poverty line, even if only pre-transfer income is considered.Politics that Work, \\"States that Are More Generous With Cash Welfare Have Less Poverty.\\" In the United Kingdom The Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government that took office in May 2010 set out to reduce welfare dependency, primarily relying on workfare and initiatives targeted to specific groups, such as disabled people, who are more likely to spend long periods of time receiving welfare payments. The Department of Work and Pensions has released a report claiming that Disability Living Allowance, the main payment given to people who are severely disabled, \\"can act as a barrier to work\\" and causes some recipients to become dependent on it as a source of income rather than looking for a suitable job.Disability Living Allowance and work: Exploratory research and evidence review, 2010, DWP Research Report No. 648 (RR No. 648) Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary for Work and Pensions, has argued that the United Kingdom has a culture of welfare dependency and a \\"broken\\" welfare system where a person would be financially better off living on state benefits than taking a job paying less than ¬£15,000 annually.\\"Iain Duncan Smith Vows to Tackle 'Absurd' Welfare Dependency\\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/27/iain-duncan-smith-welfare- dependency Critics argue that this is the government‚Äôs excuse to execute large-scale cuts in services, and that it perpetuates the stereotype that people on Incapacity Benefit or Disability Living Allowance are unwilling to work, faking their condition, or otherwise being \\"scroungers\\". The previous Labour government introduced active labour market policies intended to reduce welfare dependency, an example of the Third Way philosophy favored by prime minister Tony Blair. The New Deal programs, targeted towards different groups of long-term unemployed people such as lone parents, young people, disabled people, and musicians, gave the government the ability to stop the benefit payments of people who did not accept reasonable offers of employment.

Through the years, the celebration has drawn crowds of up to 150,000 people during the opening weekend.https://www.aquatennialambassadors.com/vdigs History The first Oktoberfest, USA, was held on October 13, 14, and 15, 1961. In early 1960, civic leaders had agreed that La Crosse needed a community wide activity of some sort.https://www.oktoberfestusa.com/about/traditions/ The Electric Auto-Lite Co. Had closed in 1959 and the Allis Chalmers plant had suffered a decline in earnings. The city had been without such an event since 1921. Because that earlier celebration had been a winter carnival, many of the leaders were in favor of renewing this idea as a La Crosse tradition. During the fall of 1960, several officials of the La Crosse-based G. Heileman Brewing Company were also discussing an annual promotion. News of these discussions spread through the firm, eventually reaching the malt house, where two of the employees of German origin suggested an autumn festival similar to the Oktoberfest held annually in Munich. The idea was quickly accepted. In 1961, brewery officials contacted the La Crosse Chamber of Commerce and proposed the idea to chamber members. It was accepted, and both agreed that the chamber would act as the sponsoring organization. In 1962, the name \\"Oktoberfest\\" was registered with the State of Wisconsin. In 1963, \\"Oktoberfest, USA\\" was registered and listed as a trademark with the federal government. In 1965, the newly formed La Crosse Festivals, Inc., purchased the assets of Oktoberfest from the Chamber of Commerce and became the sponsoring organization. Civic leaders Joseph Becker, Carl Mertens, Bruce Hines, D.J. Petruccelli, Robert Mehren, Ross Hunt, Art Dugan, Harold Lee, Gerald Heberlein, D.D. Dickson and Robert McCann, brainstormed ideas for the festival and came up with five objectives: * Promote city pride * Obtain national publicity * Promote tourism * Involve a lot of people * Make the fest a financial success = The First Oktoberfest = The first La Crosse Oktoberfest festival was held in a location between the post office and Mary E. Sawyer auditorium. A carnival area was also set up in the First Federal Savings & Loan parking lot at 6th & State St. Among the festivities were farm fair events including cow chip throwing and greased pig contests. Antique steam engines demonstrated the area‚Äôs early lumber industry. Other activities included soccer matches, scenic boat and bus trips, a youth tent, as well as square dances, German music, and a ‚ÄúQueen Pageant.‚Äù The winner of that first pageant was Marlene Schultz, an 18-year-old from Winona, MN. In 1964 the Miss La Crosse pageant merged with the Miss Oktoberfest pageant to become Miss La Crosse/Oktoberfest. Nancy Zinn is crowned the first Miss La Crosse/Oktoberfest that year. In addition to the above events, a parade was held. The 4-mile, three and a half-hour parade drew an estimated 30,000-50,000 spectators in 1961. 1962, the parade would be given the name ‚ÄúMaple Leaf Parade‚Äù at the suggestion of Terry Witzke, a teacher at Emerson Elementary school, in appreciation for La Crosse‚Äôs landscape. That year, the parade drew 70,000 spectators from around the Midwest. In 1963, the parade drew 200,000. A second parade, named the Torchlight parade, was added in 1965 to showcase the north side of La Crosse. The parade marks the opening of the four-day celebration. In subsequent years, additional festivities have been added including the traditional ‚ÄúTapping of the Keg‚Äù ceremony followed by the Edelweiss Parade that accompanies the golden key to the fest grounds. There is also an annual Oktoberfest auto race held at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway (1969), a Medallion Hunt, (1971), Ladies Day Luncheon, Lederhosen Luncheon, Kartenspiele (card games), Dachshund Dash, Viener Vogue, and Craft Beer Night. In 1976, the festival added the Maple Leaf Marathon, which is now known as the YMCA Maple Leaf Walk-Run Half Marathon, held on Saturday during the fest. = Oktoberfest Today = The Oktoberfest celebration in La Crosse, Wisconsin is an annual German festival that made its way to La Crosse in 1961. What started as a simple community event has turned into decades of tradition and good, old fashioned fun.https://www.oktoberfestusa.com/about/ Oktoberfest serves as much more than an excuse to drink beer: Oktoberfest conserves German heritage, sustains German cultural practices and beliefs, and ensures the existence of German culture in the context of the future. This festival effectively evokes the area‚Äôs German heritage through authentic Bavarian music, German foods such as bratwursts and sauerkraut, pints of German brews, and people wearing traditional Bavarian clothing, dirndls and lederhosen. The importance and uniqueness of Oktoberfest to Wisconsinites‚Äô heritage is prevalent as La Crosse‚Äôs celebration of Oktoberfest is one of the largest celebrations in the world and is the longest-running Oktoberfest in the midwestern area of the United States. The La Crosse Oktoberfest schedule of events for 2019 included: * Special Fester Ball * Miss La Crosse/Oktoberfest USA Scholarship Pageant * Parade Marshal Announcement * Mrs. Oktoberfest Reception * Festmaster's Ball New La Crosse Oktoberfest events in 2019 included: * Torchlight After Glow Bash * Ed's Carnival Rides * Maple Leaf Parade Family Zone * Barks and Brews * Brats for Seniors * Kartenspiele Signature Oktoberfest USA Events include: * Oktoberfest USA Medallion Hunt * Torchlight Parade * Tapping of the Golden Keg * Craft Beer Night There are also 24 musical acts, German food, beer and tradition. https://www.news8000.com/news/oktoberfest-usa-2019-schedule-of- events/1118005689 = Oktoberfest Royal Family = In 1962, the position of Festmaster was created. This person was to be chosen based on his contributions to the community, as well as being a good family man with a reputation for honesty and integrity, successful in his chosen profession, along with other characteristics. The first Festmaster in 1962 was Don Rice, President of Exchange State Bank. The Festmaster is the head of the Oktoberfest Royal Family. In 1968, the title of Mrs. Oktoberfest was created, and the first winner was Joyce Lindseth. In 1971 the Festmaster‚Äôs Grenadier Corps was created to appear at Oktoberfest events along with the royal family. = Beer Tents = As beer is an important part of the original Oktoberfest celebration in Germany, the La Crosse Oktoberfest has always had a beer tent as part of the festivities. G. Heileman Brewing Company was the official supplier of beer during the fest‚Äôs early years. While this beer tent worked in the early years of the fest, by 1966, the beer tent was marked by ‚Äúrowdiness and excessive drinking‚Äù which caused chaos in the aftermath as swarms of teenagers mobbed the bars in downtown La Crosse after the tent closed down. In response, the festival organizers in 1967 closed the beer tent and changed the focus to dairy products. This decision left the festival in a financial deficit. In 1968, the festival organization, Oktoberfest U.S.A., decided to promote the festival as a family event while bringing back the beer tent. They raised the drinking age inside the tent to 21 years old to cut down on the excessive drinking. Through 70s, 80s, and 90s, the South Side beer tent had its share of issues, especially the problem of beer throwing among the younger beer tent crowd. In response, the festival increased security and added local police to quell this habit. = Timeline = 1965: the North Side Fest Grounds were created at the intersection of Rose and Clinton Streets (in Copeland Park) to coincide with the Torchlight parade. The North Side grounds were developed as the family grounds featuring carnival rides and games as well a small beer tent. 1971: the original fest grounds, now known as the South Side Fest Grounds moved from its original location to a new location at 2nd and La Crosse Streets (1 Oktoberfest Stra√üe) where a $20,000 permanent structure known as ‚ÄúThe Bier Hall‚Äù was constructed. 1978: the inaugural Burgermeister Dinner is held, which evolved into what became the Burgermeister Breakfast. The breakfast honored the mayor and other city and council leaders. 1984: a permanent shelter to was constructed at Copeland Park to be used for protection during Oktoberfest and in winter as an ice rink with an accompanying warming house. 1989: the first ‚ÄúSpecial Fester‚Äù, an area child with special needs, was named. The Special Fester participates in many Royal Family activities and oversees Special Fester Day, a weekday of free carnival rides and activities for area children with special needs. Miranda Roberts of Onalaska was the first honoree. 2000: the festival was expanded from its original 4 days to 9 days and was named in a USA Today article as ‚Äúone of the best Old-World folk festivals in the U.S.‚Äù 2007: the first Wienerfest was held. This annual event held in spring, helps to fund Oktoberfest activities. 2014: the festival was shortened back down to its original 4 days due to the festival losing money three of the previous four years. 2018: La Crosse Oktoberfest changed the method of entry. Originally, festgoers were able to enter the fest ground after purchasing an official Oktoberfest USA button. In order to better keep track of the number of people entering the grounds, they developed a printed pass with a bar code that is scanned prior to entry. 2020: Oktoberfest USA was scrapped for the first time after 59 years. COVID-19 pandemic caused officials to cancel it and defer to 2021.

It aired on September 26, 2011. Plot Marshall has acquired a blue tie with a yellow-duck pattern, which Barney despises because he finds the design unstylish. Now that Lily is pregnant, her breasts have gotten bigger, so Barney wants to see them; both Lily and Marshall refuse. The group decide to go to \\"Shinjitsu\\", a teppanyaki restaurant, for dinner, where Barney insults the cooking style, claiming he can do with ease all the techniques the chef can do. Marshall becomes angry and challenges Barney to do every technique, with permission to touch Lily's breasts if he succeeds. If Barney fails, he must wear the ducky tie for one year. Barney unnerves Marshall and Lily throughout dinner with suggestions that he is as adept at cooking as he claims and has gone to the effort to take the Shinjitsu training course. Lily begins to suspect that Barney has been preparing for this the entire time when she sees him and the chef looking at each other, and Marshall realizes that Barney has been conditioning Marshall to associate Barney's sneezing with the desire to go to \\"Shinjitsu\\" as part of a future scheme to use Marshall if Barney ever wanted something from him. When Barney offers to call off the bet if he is allowed to see Lily's breasts for 30 seconds in the alley, they accept until Robin points out that touching her breasts is all he has ever wanted. Lily and Marshall are confident they have won the bet until after dinner, when Barney easily executes all but one of the cooking techniques. In desperation, Lily pulls up her shirt and flashes her breasts at Barney, which distracts and prevents him from succeeding at the final cooking technique. When the group returns to MacLaren's, Barney reluctantly begins wearing the ducky tie. Meanwhile, during dinner, Ted relays the story of what happened when he ran into Victoria again at the Architect's Ball in \\"The Naked Truth\\". Ted makes a long-awaited apology for cheating on her, which Victoria accepts, saying she is no longer angry. However, she is surprised to learn that Ted does not find it strange that he, Robin and Barney hang out every night, despite the fact that both men dated and broke up with Robin. When Ted offers to help Victoria wash the dishes at her bakery, he learns that she is going to be engaged to Klaus, a classmate from Germany. He becomes upset when he further learns that she got together with him a day and a half after she and Ted broke up, meaning that he spent years feeling guilty for kissing Robin when Victoria was planning on leaving him for Klaus anyway. They end up arguing, but begin reminiscing about their time together after Ted reveals he deeply regretted cheating on her and they had loved one another; they end up sharing a kiss. Despite the kiss, Victoria realizes that she wants to be with Klaus and leaves to meet him for a trip in the Hamptons. Though he concludes the story there with his friends, Future Ted reveals that he had asked Victoria what she imagined their lives would be like had they stayed together. Victoria had responded that Ted's relationships over the past six years have failed because of Robin, telling him that she is a bigger part of his life than he realizes and warns him that the current friendship that he shares with Robin and Barney does not work. Though Ted had not believed Victoria at the time, Future Ted reveals that she had been right. Reception Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode an A‚àí.

In the European context it came to prominence as a consequence of the religious divisions in the early modern period that followed the Protestant Reformation. Resistance theories could justify disobedience on religious grounds to monarchs, and were significant in European national politics and international relations in the century leading up to the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. They can also underpin and justify the concept of revolution as now understood. The resistance theory of the early modern period can be considered to predate the formulations of natural and legal rights of citizens, and to co-exist with considerations of natural law. Any \\"right to resist\\" is a theory about the limitations on civil obedience. Resistance theory is an aspect of political theory; the right of self-defence is usually taken to be a part of legal theory, and was no novelty in the early modern period. Arguments about the two concepts do overlap, and the distinction is not so clear in debates. The language of magistracy Resistance theory has been formulated as \\"resistance to the magistrate\\", where magistrate stands for authority in the legal form. In effect \\"magistrate\\" here may stand for head of state, but the modern concept of state grew up alongside the early modern resistance theories, rather than preceding them. Reference was made, for example by Althusius to classical history: to the ephors of the Spartan Constitution, as \\"lesser magistrates\\", or to the optimates of the late Roman Republic.Arthur P.

A little before that development come statements of John Ponet, Christopher Goodman and John Knox (The Monstruous Regiment of Women).Burns, p. 194; Google Books. The annotations of the Geneva Bible pointed to exemplars of resistance theory (and were not unique in that).Patrick Collinson, Elizabethans (2003), p. 45; Google Books. The literature includes but is not limited to the Huguenot resistance theory of the French Wars of Religion. Theodore Beza produced the 1574 work Right of Magistrates; it was followed by the anonymous Vindiciae contra tyrannos (1579). Resistance theory also became important for the justification of the Dutch Revolt. In the Politica (1603) of Johannes Althusius, one of the occasions justifying resistance to a supreme magistrate by inferior magistrates (roughly, members of the \\"ruling class\\"), in the case of tyranny, is for a prince or group of rulers of provinces, extended to the provincial \\"authorities\\", this matching the situation of the Revolt. Althusius was closer to Zwingli than Calvin in his approach, in fact, and clarified his views on church and state in successive editions. Hugo Grotius, expelled from the Dutch Reformed Church because of his Remonstrant views, altered the question of resistance theory in two ways. In De jure belli ac pacis he argued against the distinction from the right of self-defence and accountable government. But he also modified the question, influentially, to include the removal of private warfare from political society (an issue of pacification).Deborah Baumgold, Contract Theory in Historical Context: essays on Grotius, Hobbes, and Locke (2010), p. 29‚Äì30; Google Books. =Catholic resistance theory= In the French context, Catholic resistance theory grew on the ultramontanism of the time, and developed through controversy and political alignment. This situation came about because the opposite \\"cismontane\\" tendency, Gallicanism, came to be allied with the politiques, and the royalist view tending to divine right.Burns, p. 233; Google Books. Therefore, the opponents of the monarchs Henry III and Henry IV in France, in the Catholic League, came to reason in favour of the limitations on royal power that their opponents denied. The position after the Council of Trent left the Jesuits opposed to the \\"liberties\\" claimed by the Gallican Church, and defenders of ultramontanism.Burns, p. 231; Google Books. The tradition of the papal deposing power was defended, in indirect form, by Robert Bellarmine in 1586, which amounted to validating some resistance by subjects; in reply Louis Servin in 1591 wrote a vindication in extreme form of Gallican liberties.Burns, p. 232; Google Books. =Resistance theory and the Church of England= The Church of England after the Elizabethan Settlement was a church open to Calvinist ideas, rather than a Calvinist church: Reformed theology was accepted on a piecemeal basis. The 1568 Bishops' Bible contained annotations with political content similar to those in the Geneva Bible.Edward Vallance, Revolutionary England and the National Covenant: state oaths, Protestantism, and the political nation, 1553-1682 (2005), p. 12; Google Books. Thomas Bilson published in 1585 The True Difference betweene Christian Subiection and Unchristian Rebellion, in the context of the Treaty of Nonsuch between England and the United Provinces. It was reprinted in 1643, at the outbreak of the First English Civil War.Robert Oresko, G. C. Gibbs, Hamish M. Scott, Royal and Republican Sovereignty in Early Modern Europe: essays in memory of Ragnhild Hatton (1997), p. 141; Google Books. Bilson argued against religion alone as a basis for resistance, so discounting the resistance theories of Christopher Goodman, John Knox and Huldrich Zwingli as politically based.Anthony Milton, Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600-1640 (2002), p. 517; Google Books. In The True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), James VI of Scotland set out his views on the relationship of king and subjects, against the current contractarian theories and especially the resistance theory of George Buchanan, who had been his tutor. Besides theoretical reasons for denying what Buchanan had written in De juri regni apud Scotos (1579), and dedicated to James, he felt that Buchanan had used Scottish history to support his claims only by misprision; and those views led to disorder. These opinions he did not vary on becoming king in England five years later; as for religious strife he was a conciliarist of an older tradition, in harmony with the views of Richard Hooker.W. B. Patterson, King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom (2000), pp. 23‚Äì4 and pp. 67‚Äì8. Hooker's actual views on resistance theory were careful; he criticised aspects of the Vindiciae contra tyrannos, but avoided commenting in particular on legitimate resistance.Lisa Ferraro Parmelee, Good Newes from Fraunce: French anti-league propaganda in late Elizabethan England (1996), pp. 88‚Äì9; Google Books. Churchmen who would later be seen as poles apart on theology, Thomas Morton and David Owen, wrote in the period 1605‚Äì10 on resistance theory in a way equating it with a Catholic tradition; Owen commented that the analogy general council is to papacy as peers to monarchy is false.Francis Oakley, Politics and Eternity: studies in the history of medieval and early- modern political thought (1999), p. 166; Google Books. By the time of the reign of Charles I, other considerations had come to matter more. Arminianism in the Church of England had become a source of great tension. But in theological terms Arminianism was compatible with divine right, as it was with resistance theory. The argument on resistance was going on elsewhere.Glenn Burgess, The Politics of the Ancient Constitution (1992), p. 181, p. 95, and p. 171. Resistance theory and the English Civil war A context for resistance theory in England was in the theoretical discussions of common law about how to incorporate monarchy into the \\"ancient constitution\\". Political conflicts that were stoked up by the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War took place in the 1620s with a shared consensus assumption against the legitimacy of resistance. It has been argued that the theorising from the late sixteenth century on the English ancient constitution was an \\"antidote\\" to resistance theory.p. 89; Google Books. Conrad Russell's biography of John Pym in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography comments that, while Pym almost certainly was familiar with resistance theory in its Protestant form, around the time in early 1642 when the First English Civil War was breaking out, he was too good a politician to show that he knew it. Russell has also argued that the Parliamentarians were almost completely successful in avoiding formulating a resistance theory.Conrad Russell, The Causes of the English Civil War (1990), p. 23. Whig resistance theory The Whig faction was founded at the time of the Exclusion Crisis around 1680 in British politics, and its initial purpose was to resist the legitimate succession to the throne of James, Duke of York. \\"Whig resistance theory\\" had numerous strands, in particular when compared with the opposing legitimists (Jacobites) and the other major political faction, the Tories who advocated passive obedience as dissent, and as a definite limitation on resistance theories supported only passive resistance, indeed preferring nonresistance.Nicholas T. Phillipson, Quentin Skinner, Political Discourse in Early Modern Britain (1993), p. 250; Google Books. John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, written at the time of the Exclusion Crisis but published after the Glorious Revolution, went back to the Calvinist resistance theory as in George Buchanan. Algernon Sidney like Locke replied to the Patriarcha of Robert Filmer, and provided a thorough animadversion.R. O. Bucholz, Newton Key, Early Modern England 1485-1714: a narrative history (2009), p. 298; Google Books. The trial in 1710 of Henry Sacheverell, a High Church and High Tory cleric, brought Whig resistance theories into prominence and focus, by generating a controversial literature. These developments broke apart any semblance of unity in Anglican resistance theory. Constantine Phipps defended Sacheverell, and Benjamin Hoadley who was an extreme Whig in his The Original and Institution of Civil Government Discuss'd (1710), made opposite and incompatible claims about the treatment of resistance in Richard Hooker, who by now was an iconic figure in Anglican theology.Michael Brydon, The Evolving Reputation of Richard Hooker: An Examination of Responses, 1600‚Äì1714 (2006), pp. 188‚Äì90.

What is known about Tonga before European contact comes from myths, stories, songs, poems, (as there was no writing system) as well as from archaeological excavations. Many ancient sites, kitchens and refuse heaps, have been found in Tongatapu and Ha ªapai, and a few in Vava ªu and the Niuas that provide insights into old Tongan settlement patterns, diet, economy, and culture. The Old Tonga The Ha ªapai of three thousand years ago was a bit different from the Ha ªapai of today. Large flightless birds called megapodes bounded through the tropical rain forest while giant iguanas and various other lizards rested on tree limbs.Shutler, Burley, Dickinson, Nelson, & Carlson, Oceana Publications, Early Lapita Sites, the colonisation of Tonga and recent data from northern Ha'apai The skies hosted three different species of fruit bats, three different species of pigeon, and more than two dozen other types of birds. There were no pigs, horses, dogs, cows, or rats. There were no Tongans. The South Pacific, meanwhile, was almost completely uninhabited. Any present humans existed on the western fringes of the Solomon Islands. Then, around that time, these islanders were suddenly replaced by a new branch of humanity that originated from the Bismarck Archipelago off Papua New Guinea.Patrick Vinton Kirch, The Lapita Peoples: Ancestors of the Oceanic World They intrepidly stormed through the region, rapidly colonizing and pushing east. They brought with them new plant and animal species, as well as a distinct pottery design. Today these people are named the Lapita, after the location in New Caledonia where they were first noticed in archaeology. The Lapita Period Around 2850 BP, the Lapita people reached Tonga, and carbon dating places their landfall first in Tongatapu and then in Ha ªapai soon after.Burley, Dickinson, Barton, & Shutler Jr., Lapita on the Periphery: New data on old problems in the Kingdom of Tonga The newcomers were already well adapted to the resource-scarce island life and settled in small communities of a few households on beaches just above high tide line that faced open lagoons or reefs. Through continued interaction with Lapita relatives of the west, the Ha ªapaians obtained domesticated animals and cultivatable plants, but it seems that both of these possible food sources contributed minimally towards their diet for at least the first two hundred years. Instead, they feasted mainly on life in the sea: parrotfish, wrasses, turtles, surgeonfish, jacks, eels, emperors, bottom-dwellers, shellfish, and the occasional deep water tuna. Just as their Polynesian descendants do today. Sea food was inexhaustible, so reefs then were not much different from reefs today, except for the marked decline in sea turtle populations. Fauna didn't fare as well, however, and soon the giant iguanas, the megapodes, twenty four bird species, almost all pigeons, and all but one species of fruit bat were all extinct. They hunted and cooked these animals with the most basic of technologies. When shell pieces were too brittle for tools, they utilized volcanic soils for ‚Äúandesite/basalt used for adze manufacture and other artifacts such as oils as hammerstones, weaving weights, cooking stones, and decorative pebbles for grave decoration.‚ÄùDavid V. Burley, Journal of World Prehistory, Vol.12, No.3, 1998, Tongan Archaeology and the Tongan Past, 2850-150 B.P. If they were lucky, they obtained harder obsidian shards from the far northern fringe volcano of Tafahi in the Niuas. Another useful technology was their eponymous pottery with ‚Äúdentate‚Äù impressions and simple designs that were characteristic of all Lapita settlements in the South Pacific. Tongan Lapita designs were simpler than western Lapita designs, evolving from ornate curvilinear and rectilinear patterns into simple rectilinear forms. The pottery was ‚Äúslab-built earthenware of andesitic-tephra clay mixed with calcareous or mineral sand tempers and fired at a low temperature.‚Äù Decades of archaeological excavations of ancient Lapita kitchens and middens (refuse piles) both in Tongatapu and Ha ªapai have taught us much about early Tongan settlement. We know what they ate, what tools they used, where they settled (one colony each on ‚ÄòUiha, Kauvai, and Foa, and two on Lifuka), and how large the settlements were. Despite a wealth of archaeological evidence, however, the Lapita people still stifle us with two main mysteries: How did they spread through the South Pacific so quickly, and why did the Lapita settlers in Tonga quickly abandon their ornate pottery tradition? The Lapitan diaspora began from Papua New Guinea in 1500 B.C. By 2850 BP(900BCE) they were already in Tonga, meaning they virtually sprinted east for three hundred years. They travelled in small wooden boats over open ocean to invisible destinations faster than the Europeans colonizers walked across their continent. Archaeologists wonder what would compel people to embark on statistically suicidal missions. It doesn't appear that population pressure was a problem, because most Lapitan islands were sparsely inhabited and could have supported much higher populations, especially if they had turned more towards available root crops. A hypothesis from Kirch is that Lapitan culture encouraged emigration by younger sons. Not just in Tonga, but throughout the South Pacific is a tradition of passing down land to eldest sons. To obtain their own land, younger sons needed to explore. Tangaloa, the chief Tongan god before the arrival of Christianity, was a younger sibling who created Tonga while searching for land from a canoe. His fish hook accidentally caught on a rock on the ocean floor and he was able to pull Tonga to the surface. If the hypothesis is correct, then there must have been some strong sibling rivalry to entice someone to fall upon places as far away as New Zealand, Hawai ªi, and Easter Island. The other great mystery is why the ornate pottery tradition disappeared, and with such speed. Only two hundred years after arriving, the Lapitan settlers ceased to decorate their earthenware pots at all, and the only thing the leading contemporary Tongan archaeologist can say about the disappearance is that, ‚ÄúUnfortunately most explanations are based on inferential speculation, and they are difficult to validate with any degree of certainty. What we can say with confidence is that, for whatever reason pottery decoration ceased in Tonga, it did so rather suddenly.‚Äù The Polynesian Plain ware Period: 2650‚Äì1550 BP (700 BCE ‚Äì 400 AD) Life began to change drastically for Ha ªapaians at the same time that ornate pottery was replaced by a strictly utilitarian plain ware kit, and it is at this time that the people may be called Polynesian. Of all the linguistically and traditionally similar people who came to inhabit the triangle created by New Zealand, Hawai‚Äôi, and Easter Island, they can all trace ancestry to a few original settlers in Tonga. These original Polynesians in Tonga shifted somewhat away from maritime subsistence towards an increased reliance on agriculture and animal husbandry. Taro, yam, breadfruit, and banana became principal carbohydrate sources, and domesticated animals came to represent much more of the diet. At original Lapita sites, 24% of bird bones came from chickens, which increased after the Polynesian transformation into 81%, marking probably the demise of other bird species as well as an increased reliance on domesticated species. More energy supportive food sources allowed a population explosion. A 25x40 m Lapitan ‚Äúhamlet‚Äù grew into a village over one kilometer in length. Settlement grew around most of the lagoon in Tongatapu and villages finally reached the interior of the main island. Similar expansions have been identified in the Niuas and in Vava‚Äôu. To archaeologists, these early Polynesians provide a mystery just as perplexing as the Lapitans. By 1550BP (400 BCE), they ceased to produce any pottery at all. They seem to have turned towards more natural materials instead, and therefore the archaeological record enters into a ‚Äúdark age‚Äù of relatively little information until the emergence of chiefly states hundreds of years later. Speculations as to disappearance of the pottery tradition ranges from the use of coconut cups and bowls that are easier to use, a shift away from steaming shellfish in large bowls to baking in underground ovens, and the unsuitability of Tongan clays for pottery. Nothing can be said with certainty except that the same disappearance also occurred in Fiji and Samoa. The Formative Dark Age: 1550 ‚Äì 750 BP (400 BCE ‚Äì 1200 AD) Little is known about the period because of the absence of much archaeological evidence. What is clear is that population continued to increase, reaching between 17,000 and 25,000 on Tongatapu, and that chiefdoms arose to protect against the increased competition for resources. Tongatapu may have been politically consolidated by a single individual of the future Tu ªi Tonga familial line, as oral tradition traces the king's lineage back through 39 individuals that could have started as early as 1000 bp (950 AD). The maritime empire made famous by oral tradition, however did not begin until after 750 BP (1200 AD).

Early life Carlos Vierra was born and raised in Moss Landing, California near Monterey by his father, Portuguese sailor, Cato Vierra and his mother, Maria de Fratas. Vierra went to school in Monterey, California and had a hard time deciding between a life at sea and art. He studied art at the Mark Hopkins Institute (now the San Francisco Art Institute) under Gottardo Piazzoni in the 1890s, until he was twenty-five. Wanting to further his studies, Vierra took a six-month trip around Cape Horn to New York City. Once there, he worked hard to become an illustrator, a growing artistic field. In time, his art began to comfortably sustain him, though only for a short time. In 1904, at age twenty-eight, Vierra contracted tuberculosis and, at the advice of his doctor, relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Vierra decided to live in a remote, small cabin along the Pecos River. When his health was not improved, he was forced to get help from the Sanitarium. New Mexico Vierra was Santa Fe's first resident artist and was one of the first three \\"members\\" of the Santa Fe Art Colony. He was a strong advocate for preserving landmark buildings and for making sure that new buildings were in the style that is so unique to Santa Fe. That style is now known as the Pueblo Revival Style architecture. It was at the Sunmount Sanatarium, a restorative institution for tubercular consumption, where Vierra met architect John Gaw Meem and others who influenced each other and made sure the Pueblo Revival style of Santa Fe was preserved. The first houses in 1925 and 1926 that John Gaw Meem designed show a clear debt to his mentor, Carlos Vierra. In 1909, the School of American Archaeology's director, Edgar Lee Hewett appointed Vierra to manage the building of the New Mexico Museum of Art (formerly the Museum of Fine Arts). Hewett also allowed him to have an influential role in restoring the Palace of the Governors, the oldest capitol building in the United States. Additionally, he painted three murals in the St. Francis Auditorium. In 1914, Frank Springer commissioned Vierra to paint each of the pueblo mission churches. These and other paintings would show both Spanish and Pueblo traditional New Mexico architecture. In 1918, after he wrote, \\"'See Santa Fe First.' There is a reason [to do so] in our rare climate, in our wonderful surroundings and in what is left of historic Santa Fe. Are we going to destroy what is left‚Ä¶or are we going to build in keeping with it?\\" Vierra began construction on a pueblo style home for his family on Old Santa Fe Trail. It is considered the first residence built in the Spanish Pueblo Revival Style architecture. The home was funded by Frank Springer, who was a patron of the arts. Other achievements Vierra was commissioned and executed Six murals of Mayan cities for the 1915 Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition in San Diego. The 35mm reproductions of his murals can be seen on an interior wall of the Museum of Man, Balboa Park, San Diego. In addition to his illustrating and painting, Vierra opened his own photography studio on the west side of the Santa Fe Plaza, which he purchased for $280 from J.B. Aylsworth on November 27, 1905. In the 1920s he became involved in aerial photography and documented archeological sites from the sky. Vierra was also a captain in the New Mexico National Guard.

Created by Dr. Bosconovitch, Alisa is a gynoid with detachable body parts. She and Lars Alexandersson are the main protagonists of the console versions of that game's Scenario Campaign mode. Her surname is commonly misspelled as \\"Boskonovitch\\", because her creator's surname is spelled that way. Alisa has received a generally positive reception from fans of the series, proving to be one of the more popular characters introduced in Tekken 6. She has been both praised and criticised for her character design. Character design Unlike other new Tekken 6 characters who were based on fan input, both Alisa and Lars were created using a different approach, focusing on their importance to the game's story. In an interview, Tekken project director and chief producer Katsuhiro Harada said, \\"Alisa's quite popular overseas as well. Personally, I didn't think we would get much of a following. We usually do research for new characters, but Alisa was something we created based on internal staff feedback. We really wanted a character with chainsaws on her arms.\\" Scriptwriter Dai Sat≈ç then asked, \\"Influenced by Ash by any chance?\\" Harada replied, \\"Exactly. (laugh) I'm a huge fan of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead. I just didn't think Alisa would catch on, considering her vast differences from the other characters.\\"As quoted in The Art of Tekken Hybrid (Namco Bandai Games Inc., 2011), 26. Sat≈ç said in 2011 that he had chosen her as one of the two lead characters because he felt Alisa is \\"the face of the franchise's future\\". Katsuhiro Harada, described her as \\"a robot created in the image of Dr. Bosconovitch's daughter.\\" = Gameplay = Alisa is entirely bionic and amplifies many of her attacks with collapsible jet pack like wings from her back and rockets from her feet she can also extend chainsaws from her lower arms. Her body parts are detachable, they instantly grow back in what appears to be nanoparticle-assisted regeneration. All of her body parts appear to be non-critical, some of her attacking moves involves removing her own head to use as a weapon or even a makeshift explosive device with no ill effects, and arms can be torn off by the opponent or even used as improvised missiles. Alisa uses attacks such as rockets, an explosive head and attacks from her chainsaw appendages. Her fighting style has been listed as simply \\"Unique\\". In the Korean version, Alisa's chainsaws are changed into energy beams reminiscent of lightsabers, and body parts can not be removed. However, all of her moves remain intact such as Alisa's head explosion replace with a small ball. Appearances =In video games= Alisa Bosconovich was created to protect Jin Kazama and serves him through her travels. Alisa is placed in a starring role in the console-only Scenario Campaign mode in Tekken 6. After being activated following a botched raid on a Mishima Zaibatsu lab, she joins Lars Alexandersson in his pursuit of his lost memories (which occur as a result of the events at the lab). She is controlled by the CPU in this mode (unless the player chooses to play as Alisa herself, at which point CPU control is given to Lars). Alisa helps Lars (or whoever the player has chosen to use in Scenario Campaign) battle the waves of enemies and has an AI system that grows as she participates in battle. She keeps a journal which she constantly updates with entries regarding the events of her journey with Lars, as well as her own personal opinion about them. It is later revealed that she is actually an android in the employ of Jin, to which she has been serving as a way for Jin to observe what has been happening in the world at large. She is commanded by Jin to disable safe mode (including her personality and behavior inhibition programming) and attack Lars. After a stalemate battle with Lars, she leaves for the desert to join Jin. When Lars arrives, she attacks him again where this time she is ultimately defeated and shuts down. Lars rescues her body and takes her to a robotics corporation (run by Lee Chaolan) where she can be revived. Although the scenario campaign was removed from PlayStation Portable's port, the developers added background information for the character. In Tekken 7, Alisa has been revived, though suffers memory loss and attacks Lee in self defence upon rebooting. Upon losing, Alisa remembers who Lee is, though questions why she is at Violet systems. Lee then uses his machinery to restore Alisa's memory, which then gives her the desire to find Lars. Before Lee can take her to Lars though, Violet Systems is attacked by the Tekken Force. Lee and Alisa fight them off and flee to another of Lee's facilities, where Lars had been waiting. Alisa happily jumps on Lars in excitement, though the Tekken Force attack again, searching for Jin's body. Alisa assists Lars and Lee in fighting off the Tekken force but Alisa is stopped by Nina Williams who stalls Alisa long enough for a Tekken Force helicopter to capture Jin. Lee proceeds to blow up his facility, killing countless members of the Tekken force, whilst Alisa flies away happily holding Lars. in Tekken 8, Alisa has been New Ultimate Form Her eyes are Become Pink. Other than the main games of the series, Alisa also appears in the portable game Tekken 3D: Prime Edition as well as the non-canon Tekken Tag Tournament 2, in which her ending (as well as other character's) reinforces her friendship with Ling Xiaoyu first shown in the animated CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance. Outside of the Tekken series, she is a playable character in Street Fighter X Tekken as downloadable content, alongside her official tag partner, Lars. She appears as an assist unit in Project X Zone, alongside fellow Tekken characters Jin, Xiaoyu, and a younger Heihachi Mishima. She appears as an unlockable character in the free-to-play game, Tekken Revolution. =Other appearances= Michelle Ballee as Alisa at E3 2012, alongside Ling Xiaoyu Alisa appears as one of the main characters in the 2011 CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance. She is a student in the Kyoto International School and befriends Ling Xiaoyu but hides the fact that she is a robot. She acts upon the orders of Jin to find Shin Kamiya along with Xiaoyu under the forced orders of Anna Williams. After Xiaoyu saves her from an ambush attack from Anna, she joins Xiaoyu in finding the truth about the M-cell experiments done on Shin. Throughout the film, she starts to develop a sense of humanity in which she would often hesitate even under her normal protocol commands and her fondness with her friendship with Xiaoyu. During the final battle between Heihachi Mishima and Devil Jin, a severely damaged Alisa sacrifices herself by distracting Heihachi with a blast allowing Jin to defeat him. In the end Jin reverses her standby mode and end credits show her fully restored and discussing how she and Xiaoyu should enter the Tekken tournament. Alisa appears in the Tekken Tag Tournament 2 live-action short film portrayed by Amandine Desprez. Alisa appears in Tekken Comic, a manga based on Tekken 6. A live-action Alisa, portrayed by Michelle Ballee, also appears in the Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Girl Power Trailer, shown at Comic-Con in 2012. In 2012, Kotobukiya released an Alisa Bosconovitch action figure as part of their Tekken Tag Tournament 2 toyline. Reception Randolph Ramsay of GameSpot praised Alisa for her move list the fact that she uses her head as an explosive and attacks from her chainsaw appendages, after stating \\"Alisa is just sheer fun to play as given her frankly bizarre move list\\". GameSpot opined that Alisa is the most fun to play as out of all the new characters in Tekken 6, stating \\"She has a charge-up attack that results in her firing her forearms in a devastating rocket attack. As with all such moves in Tekken, it's generally easy enough to dodge but can be pulled off with some aplomb when you really want to ram home your superiority against a showboating or incompetent opponent--or just someone who elects to play as Eddy or Christie.\\" Ryan Clements of IGN also commented on her move list, calling it \\"ridiculous\\", but in a good way, since he enjoyed using her. GameSpy commented that \\"Alisa's style is wild,\\" but called her getup \\"completely absurd.\\" 1UP.com commented that Alisa is sexy, cute and has a bubbly personality and stated that she's \\"the coolest new Tekken character to emerge in years,\\" praising her chainsaws and head bomb. GameZone said she is a good character and commented that her attacks are devastating, stating that \\"You‚Äôll catch on to her secret whenever her robotic parts creep out and pummel an opponent.\\" Team Xbox declared the move where Alisa removes her head as \\"one of the most hilarious moves in the franchise's history.\\" Alisa has also been given comments on her looks. VideoGamer.com called her a \\"sexed-up cyborg\\" and thought her rocket projectile attack was coming out of her breasts. They also opined that she seems overpowered at first \\"but upon closer inspection lacks the essential Tekken tools to ensure long-term usefulness\\". NZGamer said that she is \\"as cute as a button\\" and comments that she has a mismatched wardrobe. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb commented that for a robot, Alisa is pretty. In a list of \\"12 match-ups we want to see in Street Fighter X Tekken\\" article by GamesRadar, they listed a match-up between Alisa and Juri, stating \\"What do nerds love even more than robots? Hot girls that are robots. Alisa and Juri both fit the bill perfectly\\". In GamesRadar article for Street Fighter X Tekken, they stated \\"Though new, the mechanically winged android has become one of the lead stars of the franchise.\\" In 2012, she was listed as one of the most \\"ridiculous\\" Tekken characters by Game Informer, who said \\"Why is a stupid robot fairy in a fighting game? I don't think even Namco Bandai knows the answer to that\\". In 2013, Complex listed Alisa as the tenth \\"most badass Russian character in video games\\", where they observe \\"Alisa is known to be a real sweetheart once you get to know her.\\" In a 2012 official fan poll held by Bandai Namco, Alisa was the sixth-most requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter, receiving 10,650 (12.09%) of 88,280 votes.

Life Alfred Vogel was born in 1902 in Aesch, Basel, Switzerland.Griggs, Barbara; Van der Zee, Barbara. New Green Pharmacy: The Story of Western Herbal Medicine. Vermilion. p. 316 At the age of 21, he moved to Basel to manage a health store.Pioneer in Natural Health - since 1923. avogel.com. Retrieved 18 April 2020. In 1927, he married Sophie Sommer; together they had two daughters. In 1929, he started publishing a monthly magazine, Das Neue Leben (\\"the new life\\"). From 1941 this became A. Vogel Gesundheits-Nachrichten (\\"health news\\"). In the 1930s, Vogel relocated to Teufen in Appenzell. Vogel was an avid traveller and enjoyed visiting new countries and meeting new cultures. He was especially interested in meeting indigenous peoples in a close relationship with nature. From the 1950s onward, he travelled extensively through Africa, North America, Oceania, and South America. On one of his travels he met and stayed with the Sioux in the United States. The story goes that he befriended Ben Black Elk, son of medicine man Nicholas Black Elk, who Vogel says, taught him about the Native American herbal tradition.Jacqueline Young, Complementary Medicine for Dummies, John Wiley and Sons, 2007, p. 201 However, Ben Black Elk was known to be merely earning his bread as an actor by having taken pictures of him with tourists near Mount Rushmore for money, also starring in the 1962 film How the West Was Won. Upon Vogel‚Äôs departure, Ben Black Elk allegedly gave him a farewell present: a handful of seeds of Echinacea purpurea (purple coneflower). Back in Switzerland, Vogel began cultivating and researching the plant, eventually creating Echinaforce, that would become his flagship product. In 1963, Vogel established Bioforce AG in Roggwil in Thurgau, Switzerland. He died in 1996 in Feusisberg at the age of 93.  Criticism  For years, Alfred Vogel was known as doctor A. Vogel or dr. Vogel. Vogel allegedly received an honorary doctorate in botanical studies in 1952 from the California University of Liberal Physicians in Los Angeles, allowing him to style himself \\"dr.h.c. A. Vogel\\". That institute was dissolved long ago, and the legitimacy of its diplomas is disputed; nowadays, some blank CULP diplomas are on display at the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices, originally in the American Medical Association's quackery museum. Because he was not a physician, but did sell 'natural medicines', the title dr. Vogel implied an invalid association. After a complaint in 1981 at the Dutch Advertising Standards Authority (Dutch: '), he and his products were gradually no longer called dr. Vogel. On 14 October 1982, Dutch teacher, presenter and comedian published an article in the science section of NRC Handelsblad on this matter, in which he branded Vogel a quack. Alfred Vogel was a member of Jehovah's Witnesses. Vogel propagated some doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses in his book Der kleine Doktor (\\"The Nature Doctor\\"). In older editions, for example, one can read that God prohibited blood transfusion, and that applying this medical treatment could lead to a change in character. During a November 2014 episode of the satirical television show Zondag met Lubach, Vogel's \\"invention\\" of Echinaforce was criticised and mocked.

Craig Watkins is an American professor at the University of Texas at Austin and a media professional involved primarily with interactions between youth culture and the digital age. His research explores connections between race, culture, and education, as well as how certain aspects of media are affecting young adults. He has spoken at many American universities, and has been a guest on National Public Radio as well as a speaker at media conferences across the country. Background S. Craig Watkins is a prominent figure in the media world. Watkins focuses primarily on researching youth culture and how young adults are being affected by technology and the digital age. He has explored many aspects of the digital age in his work, including the effects of Hip Hop in African American communities, how gaming is connected with race, culture, and education, and the evolution of social media platforms. Watkins received his PhD from the University of Michigan, and currently teaches at the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of Radio, Television and Film, as well as African American Studies and Sociology. At the University, he serves as a Faculty Fellow for the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement. Watkins is also a Global Fellow for the IC¬≤, a group of individuals from around the world that work collaboratively on creative, academic, and innovative ideas. He is one of 160 members, including 18 faculty members from the University of Texas, Austin, in the Program. Fellows in this program include experts in technology, commercialization, innovative management, chaos theory, entrepreneurship, alliance building, and regional economic activity. Watkins has been invited to be a Research Fellow at Stanford‚Äôs Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. The Center seeks to integrate innovative thinkers in order to advance society‚Äôs understanding of social, cultural, historical, psychological, and scientific issues. Fellows at Stanford‚Äôs Center for Advanced Study are focusing on preventing future economic and social issues on a global scale. Literature and publishing S. Craig Watkins has been exploring the trends and behavior of young individuals use of digital media. Watkins founded ‚ÄúThe Young and the Digital‚Äù website after a decade of research, observation and interviews with hundreds of young adults. He believes that media includes both technology and a social context. Depending on gender, age and race directs how social media is used and in what platforms. Watkins' understanding of the digital youth and new social platforms is unique. Watkins most recent book The Young and the Digital: What the Migration to Social Network Sites, Games, and Anytime, Anywhere Media Means for our Future analyzes the relationship between students and social media. In one interview he explains what the ‚Äúnew age of social networking and media‚Äù means for future teachers and employers. Students now have access to so much technology through their phones, laptops and wifi that technology platforms have changed the game of learning. Watkins sees the traditional style of teaching and of accessing information as outdated. Lecturing may not be the most effective form of presenting information to students. As Watkins puts it, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre active learners, as opposed to passive learners. The one-way flow of content- I don‚Äôt know how effective that is anymore‚Äù. In \\"The Young and the Digital,\\" Watkins compares the automobile and the telephone ‚Äì and the criticism both developments incurred when they first began to transform society (fostering ‚Äúfar flung relationships‚Äù and ‚Äúinauthentic intimacy‚Äù) ‚Äì to the skepticism felt by older generations toward rampant internet, social media and game usage of contemporary teenage and youth generations. A key point that they miss when considering youth technology culture, he mentions, is that teenagers and young adults are using technology to communicate with people they already know: consuming, sharing and producing media for the friends and classmates they interact with in off-line life already. In this way, youth technology usage is much more about fostering relationships that already exist than creating new ones with strangers (i.e.: through dating profiles, chat rooms, etc.). The modern teenager and young adult has learned to braid off- line and online lives together, socially, academically (with the influx of teachers employing web-based learning tools in their curriculums) and personally. Watkins' earlier writing focuses on topics that explore race, media and youth culture. His book Hip Hop Matters: Politics, Pop Culture and the Struggle for the Soul of a Movement gave him an almost iconic status within the hip-hop community. Watkins explains that this book reaches further than just hip-hop music. He wanted to examine how the culture of hip-hop has progressed through stages of social change. Specifically he looks at the relationship between African American youth, media platform, economics and politics. Community involvement and appearances Watkins is in demand as a speaker and educator. In addition to his primary teaching position at the University of Texas at Austin, he has been a valuable guest lecturer at various universities and conferences nationwide. In February 2010, Watkins gave the opening keynote address at the first annual Digital Media and Learning Conference in La Jolla, California. His speech, titled ‚ÄúHow Black and Latino Youth are remaking the Participation Gap‚Äù, focused on how minorities, particularly black and Latino youth, are changing how technology is used and how accessible it is. Other high profile conferences he contributed to include the Hechinger Institute on Education and the Media, SXSW Interactive Festival, the 2011 Literary Festival, International Festival on Weblogs and Social Media, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Watkins has also been a guest speaker on the campuses of the University of Wisconsin, Northwestern University, Foothill College, Georgetown Law School, Columbia University, George Mason University, Florida State University, Rice University and Ohio State University. The majority of the speeches and lectures given at these conferences and universities have focused on his research involving technology, media, youth, race, and society. In addition to his public appearances, he has been a guest on National Public Radio, Internet Evolution Radio, and Progressive Radio. In the future, Watkins plans to continue to speak on the national stage on social media in the digital age and how it affects society, and will begin to speak on new research involving education and digital media as it is completed. His writing can be found in his three books, The Young and the Digital, Hip Hop Matters, and Representing, and also on his blogs for the Huffington Post and DML Central.

The station was located at Homan Avenue and Lake Street in the East Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago. Homan was situated east of Pulaski and west of Kedzie. Homan opened in March 1894 and closed on January 9, 1994, when the entire Green Line closed for a renovation and rehabilitation project. The station did not reopen with the rest of the Green Line on May 12, 1996. Preservation and relocation In 1997, the CTA began working with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency on a plan to preserve the historic station house by moving it two blocks west to Central Park Drive near the Garfield Park Conservatory for a new stop called Conservatory-Central Park Drive. The new station would create equal spacing between the stations at Kedzie and Pulaski but would no longer have a direct bus connection to the #82 Kimball-Homan bus route. This created some controversy in the East Garfield Park community because residents said that they would have to walk through a high crime area to get to the bus from the new station. This was also around the time when the CTA had also eliminated the #16 Lake Street bus which ran underneath the Green Line tracks. The bus route was eliminated on October 5, 1997, due to budget cuts. The neighborhood also felt that the community leaders and the Mayor favored tourists who would use the new station to visit the Garfield Park Conservatory over local residents who needed the station to be located near a bus route. On September 15, 1999, the CTA finished planning and released a project schedule to move the historic station house and use it to create a new station. The old Homan station was completely demolished by the spring of 2000, and put into storage to be later reconstructed at Central Park. Relocation of the former station house began in March 2001 and the project was finished on June 30, 2001, when the new station opened at Conservatory.

Ansel Franklin Hall was a naturalist for the National Park Service. It's said of him that \\"probably contributed more than any other individual to the formation and early growth of the interpretive work of the National Park Service (NPS).\\" He was a mentor to photographer Ansel Adams, formed the non-for-profit concessions organization Mesa Verde Company and in 1933 funded an expedition of Monument Valley to research and record information about the area.Press Release: Bill Winkler to Present Lecture on Ansel Hall‚Äôs Rainbow Bridge‚ÄìMonument Valley Expedition.

History =Early people= Evidence from the Mesa Verde area indicates that there were Paleo- Indians and people of the Archaic period in southwestern Colorado.Gibbon, Guy E.; Ames, Kenneth M. (1998) Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. p. 377. . During the transitional period from a traditional hunter-gatherer society to pueblo people, there were several distinct cultural changes:Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980]. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Park, Colorado: Mesa Verde Museum Association. p. 27-38. . Early hunters Hunter-gatherers from 10,000 years Before Present hunted and lived in a difficult terrain, traversed deep canyons and areas of few animals and limited vegetation, and managed limited access to water - which made life difficult and limited the size of their hunt groups. They were adaptive to find sufficient food, supplementing their diet with nuts, seeds and fruit from wild plants.Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980]. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Park, Colorado: Mesa Verde Museum Association. p. 27. . Artifacts were found firstly of Paleo- Indians who camped and hunted along the nearby Cajon Mesa of Hovenweep as early as 8,000 years ago and secondly from 20 sites with evidence of the Archaic people from about 6,000 BC.Hovenweep Visitor Guide, National Park Service. Retrieved 9-20-2011. Basketmakers AD 1 to 550 The people living in the Four Corners region were introduced to maize and basketry through Mesoamerican trading about 2,000 years Before Present Able to have greater control of their diet through cultivation, the hunter-gatherers lifestyle became more sedentary as small disperse groups began cultivating maize and squash. They also continued to hunt and gather wild plants.History & Culture. National Park Service. Retrieved 9-20-2011.Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980]. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Park, Colorado: Mesa Verde Museum Association. pp. 27-30. . They were named \\"Basketmakers\\" for their skill in making baskets for storing food, covering with pitch to heat water, and using to toast seeds and nuts. They wove bags, sandals, belts out of yucca plants and leaves - and strung beads. They occasionally lived in dry caves where they dug pits and lined with stones to store food. These people were ancestors of the pueblo people of the Hovenweep pueblo settlement and Mesa Verde.Rohn, Arthur H.; Ferguson, William M. (2006) Puebloan ruins of the Southwest. University of New Mexico Press. p. 148. . Modified Basketmakers AD 550 to 750 The next era, Modified Basketmakers, resulted in the introduction of pottery which reduced the number of baskets that they made and eliminated the creation of woven bags. The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet. Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing. Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes. On the rim of Mesa Verde, small groups built pit houses which were built several feet below the surface with elements suggestive of the introduction of celebration rituals.Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980]. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Park, Colorado: Mesa Verde Museum Association. 33-37. . Pueblo I - AD 750 to 900 From pueblos at Mesa Verde we learn of some advancements during this period which are reflected in the Hovenweep structures built in the next cultural period. Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes. The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look-outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams also emerged during this period.Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980]. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Park, Colorado: Mesa Verde Museum Association. pp. 39-45. . Midway through this period, about AD 900, the number of Hovenweep residential sites increased. =Pueblo II - AD 900-1150= Map of Ancient Pueblo People (Anasazi) regions, including the northern Mesa Verde region and the southern Chaco Canyon region.

Chaco cultural influence At the beginning of the Pueblo II period, there were few people living in the Mesa Verde region, many people having departed the area at the end of Pueblo I. As conditions for farming improved, people returned to the Mesa Verde region and farmed.Pueblo II - Overview. Crow Canyon Architecture Center. 2011. Retrieved 9-27-2011. Between 1080 and 1130, the Mesa Verde region was heavily influenced by the culture of the Chacoan people from New Mexico. * Chaco was the center of a large trade network, reaching as far south as Mexico. This dramatically increased access to unique goods, such as Chacoan style pottery, copper bells, macaw remains, sea shells and raw materials used to create artifacts. In addition to the integration of new goods into their culture, the extensive trade routes also brought new ideas and people to the region. * The Chaco culture had a unique architecture, \\"great houses\\" which were large, multi-storied and multi-room complexes, with great kivas located inside the structure. More than 225 great houses have been found in the northern Anasazi regions, including the Mesa Verde region. Great houses built outside of Chaco Canyon were called \\"outliers,\\" connected back to Chaco Canyon through a network of roads. Until this time, most of the people lived in disperse communities of small farmsteads, clustered around community centers which included large buildings for meetings and ceremonies and great kivas. There also appeared to have been storage areas for harvested crops. The Chacoan cultural influence was reflected in \\"great houses\\" that began appearing in Mesa Verde region communities starting about 1080, and lasting until 1140 after which point great houses were no longer built in Mesa Verde region settlements. A 50-year drought lasted from 1130 to 1180. Greenlee site, near Dove Creek Greenlee Ruins on Squaw Point, about 8 miles west of the town of Cahone was built at least by the early Pueblo II period, and possibly as early as Pueblo I. Prior to the construction of the Ansel Hall pueblo, the Greenlee site was abandoned about 1050, when Ansel Hall and Brewer Mesa pueblos were in their early stages.Dove, Donald E.

The nature of artifacts found indicate that the Ansel Hall residents had connections with the Chaco Canyon center, traded with other native people and had a similar lifestyle with their neighbors: * Tools and flakes made of Obsidian glass, possibly from an area east of Pagosa Springs in the southern San Juan Mountains or New Mexico, were found in Cahone, Yellow Jacket, James A.

Through its subsidiaries it operates mainly in the area of information technology. Shares of Formula Systems are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In 2010 Polish software maker Asseco acquired a 50.2% stake in the company.  History  Formula Systems was founded in 1985 by Dan Goldstein and his brother Gad. Dan Goldstein, who had an undergraduate degree in math and computer science and a master's in business management, had been a doctoral student at Tel Aviv University when, in 1981, he decided to leave the academic world and direct his efforts toward the private sector instead. He established a software company, which he called Formula Software Solutions, serving such clients as Egged and Mekorot, and recruited brother Gad Goldstein to work alongside him. Soon the two co-founded Formula Systems, as well as many other technology companies. Until 1998, the company established its position as a technology oriented holding company. As such, it created, developed and invested in a number of the early companies, floated and traded on Nasdaq such as BluePhoenix, Wiztech, Matrix, Sapiens International Corporation and many others. In 1998 Formula Systems acquired control of the Mashov Group, including assets such as Magic Software Enterprises, Walla!, Paradigm Geophysical, Babylon (software) and others. In 2005, Dan Goldstein separated Formula Systems into two separate entities, by spinning off all the young start-up companies under Mashov Computers, which he renamed Formula Vision. Goldstein sold his share in Formula Systems to the Emblaze Group, and dedicated himself to the cultivation of several struggling yet promising start-ups. In 2006, 33.6% of Formula was owned by Emblaze Group. In late 2010, Polish software maker Asseco, a subsidiary of Asseco Group, acquired a 50.2% stake in Formula Systems.  Subsidiaries  Formula Systems' portfolio has changed over the years, but always with an emphasis on software engineering. At various times it included Magic Software Enterprises, Crystal Systems, Liraz, Sivan, Matrix IT, Sapiens International Corporation, New Applicom, Sintec, nextSource, and BluePhoenix Solutions.

Construction and career Completed in 2010, she is a sister vessel of , and . Le Boreal entered service on 6 May 2010. Between 25 February and 6 March 2018, video journalist and podcaster Brady Haran conducted an expedition to Antarctica aboard this vessel. = 2015 engine room fire = On 18 November 2015 Le Boreal suffered a major engine room fire which caused the loss of all power and left her drifting. The captain ordered the ship, with 347 passengers and crew, to be abandoned early in the morning. A distress call was issued just after 2 a.m. while it was near Cape Dolphin, the northerly point of East Falkland, Falkland Islands. The news agency reported that 90 of the ship's 347 passengers and crew were air-lifted to safety from life rafts. The sister ship L'Austral responded to the distress call and took on some passengers. Working closely with the Falkland Islands Government, British forces enacted a major search and rescue plan. Two Sea King Royal Air Force Search and Rescue helicopters were scrambled, along with two other support helicopters, a C-130 Hercules and a Voyager aircraft for command and control. The Royal Navy patrol vessel was dispatched to the scene, as were two Dutch tugs which support British forces in the Falkland Islands. Subsequently, all passengers and crew from Le Boreal were accounted for and being looked after on the Falkland Islands. The vessel was later reported in a stable condition and the tugs were assisting to bring her alongside in the Falkland Islands for a detailed assessment of her condition. In March 2016, Ponant confirmed that Le Boreal would resume service in May. The investigators' report was released in July 2016, and attributed the fire to a ship's officer's misidentification of a clogged fuel filter; the report noted that the officer did not have a mechanic's rating, and Ponant subsequently changed several work rules in response to the report.  In popular culture  Le Boreal was featured in episode three of the fifth season of the TV series Mighty Ships. The ship was shown taking tourists to South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula.

The novel was released on June 12, 2012 by Doubleday. The book is also the third installment in the Jeremy Logan series. Plot Shortly after the events of Terminal Freeze, Dr. Jeremy Logan is contacted by an old colleague named Dr. Ethan Rush, who invites him on an expedition into the Sudd in southern Egypt. The expedition, led by famed archaeologist Dr. Porter Stone, seeks to finally locate and excavate the long-lost tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Narmer, located at the bottom of the swamp. Other members of the expedition include the head of security Frank Valentino, technician Cory Landau, archaeologist Tina Romero, and mechanic Frank Kowinsky. Also accompanying the expedition is Rush's wife Jennifer, who has been maintaining a special connection to \\"the other side\\" after a near-death experience where she technically died in a car crash, but was revived by her husband. Rush uses his special method of hypnosis to put Jennifer into a lucid state through which they can communicate with the spirits within the tomb below them, which they believe to be that of Narmer himself. The base of operations is a massive group of canvas-covered outposts floating in the middle of the Sudd, simply referred to as \\"The Station.\\" Once they finally manage to create a passageway down to the tomb entrance‚Äînicknamed the Umbilical Cord‚Äîthey slowly begin excavation through the first two chambers, known as the Gates, with the Third Gate containing the tomb of Narmer himself, while the first two Gates contain rooms full of treasure. However, when Romero studies the mummified remains within the Third Gate, she realizes that the remains are of a female body. Logan similarly draws a conclusion based on the mannerisms Jennifer displayed whenever possessed by the spirit, and deduces that it has to be a female spirit inhabiting her during the sessions, not that of a man. Thus, they realize that Narmer's queen, Niethotep, must have killed Narmer by poisoning him and taking his place in the tomb. Shortly after this discovery, Jennifer is fully possessed by the spirit of Niethotep once more, which then sabotages the ventilation system on the base and starts a fire in the engine room. She then takes two cylinders of nitroglycerin and uses one to damage the Umbilical Cord, killing Kowinsky, while holding the second one in her hand to keep everyone at bay. Valentino orders an evacuation of the Station, with most personnel taking as much treasure with them as possible, and escapes in one of the rafts along with Stone, Romero, and Landau. Logan and Rush stay behind to try to bring back Jennifer Rush and cast out the evil spirit of Niethotep, but they are unsuccessful in doing so; Niethotep throws the final canister of nitroglycerin down between her and Rush, creating an explosion that kills both of them while narrowly sparing Logan. Logan grabs a handful of treasure and escapes on one of the final rafts before the base explodes and sinks into the Sudd. Reception ‚ÄîReview by Examiner.com References to other literary works *Near the beginning, when Logan first arrives at the base, Dr. Stone mentions that it is simply called \\"The Station,\\" after the location of the same name in Heart of Darkness. *Near the climax, shortly before Landau barely survives his encounter with the possessed Jennifer Rush, he finishes reading The House on the Borderland.

Education and early career Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara's interest in marine life grew out of a lifelong love of the sea. His ancestors were mariners and his father was a founder of the Centro Velico Caprera, which honed Giuseppe's interest in Italy's marine environs and focused his childhood fascination with animals towards protecting marine life. Notarbartolo di Sciara was born in 1948 in Venice and belongs to the ancient Sicilian family Notarbartolo. He obtained laurea degrees in biological sciences (1974) and in natural sciences (1976) at the University of Parma, Italy. Opportunities for research on marine mammals in Italy were non-existent in the 1970s, however, so when he finished his studies at University of Parma, working on gobies and diving rats, he traveled to the U.S. where he resided until the 1985. At Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute in San Diego, California, he worked on beluga whales and whale sharks, as well as doing research with humpback whales in Hawaii and Bryde's whales in Venezuela. He later enrolled as a student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, where he obtained a Ph.D. (1985) in marine biology with a thesis on manta ray taxonomy and ecologyNotarbartolo di Sciara G. 1987. A revisionary study of the genus Mobula Rafinesque, 1810 (Chondrichthyes, Mobulidae), with the description of a new species. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 91:1-91.Notarbartolo di Sciara G. 1988. Natural history of the rays of the genus Mobula in the Gulf of California. Fishery Bulletin 86(1(:45-66. in the Gulf of California. There he discovered and described a new manta ray species, Mobula munkiana, which he named after his mentor, the esteemed oceanographer Walter Munk. In 1985 Notarbartolo di Sciara moved back to his home country where he started working on Mediterranean and Red Sea conservations issues. In Italy he married Flavia Pizzi. They have two children, Marco and Bianca. Research Notarbartolo di Sciara has been concerned for over 40 years with the advancement of knowledge of the natural history, ecology, behaviour, taxonomy and conservation of aquatic vertebrates, with an emphasis on whales, dolphins, seals, sharks and manta rays, and has described his research in about 230 scientific works and books, and many reports and conference presentations. While investigating manta ray taxonomy and ecology in the Gulf of California (Mexico), the research vessel on which he was living and navigating caught fire and sunk, however he continued his work after basing himself on land. Back in Milano, Italy, Notarbartolo di Sciara continued influencing marine research through his involvement with the Tethys Research Institute, a private non-profit organisation specialising in the study and conservation of Mediterranean large marine vertebrates. Under his guidance the Tethys Research Institute was steered towards a suite of research activities to provide knowledge on Mediterranean marine mammals ecology essential for the implementation of conservation measures. Conservation policy, science and management In 1986 Notarbartolo di Sciara recognised the need for an institution targeting Mediterranean marine species at risk, and founded in response the Tethys Research Institute, specialising in the study and conservation of Mediterranean marine mammals. Today Tethys is a widely respected research NGO, producing numerous scientific publications each year and supporting the work of many dozens of graduate students in marine biology. A decade later, Notarbartolo di Sciara was nominated by the President of Italy to lead the Central Institute for Applied Marine Research (ICRAM, later merged into ISPRA). His 7-year term as President of ICRAM guided that institution in a more strategic direction and allowed the creation and flourishing of many important conservation and planning initiatives, including the strengthening of marine protected area design, coordinated research within MPA sites, and applied science for conservation problem-solving. Notarbartolo di Sciara has also exhibited conservation leadership by serving as the President of the European Cetacean Societyhttp://www.europeancetaceansociety.eu/ (1993-1997). Today Notarbartolo di Sciara is well known throughout Europe as a conservation leader and television personality. He was a regular guest of \\"L‚ÄôArca di No√®\\", a series on wildlife of the world, and of Geo & Geo, a live show televised daily throughout Italy. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) While at Tethys, Notarbartolo di Sciara proposed in 1991 the creation of a large protected area for cetaceans in the north-western Mediterranean, which later became the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals, established by treaty between France, Italy and Monaco.Notarbartolo di Sciara G., Agardy T., Hyrenbach D., Scovazzi T., Van Klaveren P. 2008.

His return to Italy from the U.S. allowed fateful encounters with many of the other champions for marine conservation who would become so instrumental in making the international Pelagos Sanctuary a reality, including Prince Ranier III of Monaco. Key was his membership in and subsequent coordination role in the marine mammal working group of CIESM (the International Commission for the Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea).http://www.ciesm.org Also critically important was his leadership and support of Tethys, since the Mediterranean cetaceans that are the focus of the NGO also provided the impetus for the establishment of the Pelagos Sanctuary. His involvement with Pelagos Sanctuary continues to this day. As president of ICRAM he spearheaded the promotion of Italy's marine protected area system, based on solid science and monitoring practice. In particular, his efforts were instrumental in the launching of project \\"Afrodite\\", whereby the core zones of 15 Italian MPAs were monitored on the basis of standard protocols (e.g.,Guidetti P., Milazzo M., Bussotti S., Molinari A., Morenu M., Pais A., Span√≤ N., Balzano R., Agardy T., Boero F., Carrada G., Cattaneo-Vietti R., Cau A., Chemello R., Greco S., Manganaro A., Notarbartolo di Sciara G., Russo G.F., Tunesi L. 2008. Italian marine protected area effectiveness: does enforcement matter? Biological Conservation 141:699-709. ). Notarbartolo di Sciara has also often worked as a consultant to organisations involved in the conservation and management of the Mediterranean, including the Regional Activity Centre for Specially Protected Areas (RAC/SPA) of UNEP's Mediterranean Action Plan,Barcelona Convention and MedPAN.http://www.medpan.org. Notarbartolo di Sciara has also been heavily involved with the conservation of the Red Sea. In particular, he has been a science advisor to HEPCA, the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Associationhttp://www.hepca.com ‚Äì the main marine conservation NGO in Egypt. He was also instrumental in creating the highly touted management plan for Samadai MPA,Notarbartolo di Sciara G., Hanafy M.H., Fouda M.M., Afifi A., Costa M. 2009.

Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 89(1):211-216. which allowed tourism to co-exist with conservation of spinner dolphins and coral reefs. In 2017 with several colleagues he published a detailed review of cetaceans found in the Red Sea Notarbartolo di Sciara G., Kerem D., Smeenk C., Rudolph P., Cesario A., Costa M., Elasar M., Feingold D., Fumagalli M., Goffman O., Hadar N., Mebrathu Y.T., Scheinin A. 2017. Cetaceans of the Red Sea. CMS Technical Series 33. 86 p.. In 2013, with Erich Hoyt, he founded the IUCN Joint SSC/WCPA Task Force on Marine Mammal Protected Areas. The Task Force launched in 2016 a programme to identify Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMAs) in the world's oceans, seas and inland waters, to support marine mammal and biodiversity conservation. Protected species While the president of ICRAM, Notarbartolo di Sciara served for several years as Commissioner for Italy at the International Whaling Commission, and contributed to the establishment of a national policy on whaling issues and on the promotion of a conservation agenda within the IWC, in cooperation with other like-minded nations. In 2002 the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area ACCOBAMS came into force, and Notarbartolo di Sciara served as the chair of the Agreement's Scientific Committee from the beginning until 2010.http://www.accobams.org Notarbartolo di Sciara has served as Deputy Chair of the Cetacean Specialist GroupNotarbartolo di Sciara G., Birkun A., Jr. 2010. Conserving whales, dolphins and porpoises in the Mediterranean and Black Seas: an ACCOBAMS status report, 2010. ACCOBAMS, Monaco. 212 p. of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since 1991, and as member of the Shark Specialist Group since 1993. Notarbartolo di Sciara has been engaged in monk seal conservation science since 1986, first conducting a feasibility study for a monk seal captive-breeding a rehabilitation facility in Italy on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. In 2009 he was contracted by the Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Mediterranean Monk Seal (MOm) to draft the national conservation strategy for monk seals in Greece, and has drafted two successive editions (in 2014 and 2019) of the Regional Strategy for the Conservation of Monk Seals in the Mediterranean, both adopted by the Parties to the Barcelona Convention. Notarbartolo di Sciara serves today in the Scientific Council of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals as the Councillor for aquatic mammals. He was appointed in such capacity in 2014 by the Conference of the Parties. Teaching From 2007 to 2016 Notarbartolo di Sciara taught a course on the science and policy of conserving marine biodiversity at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, Italy. From 1985 to 1990 he held the position of contract professor at the University of Parma, teaching courses in \\"Natural history of large marine vertebrates\\", \\"Behavioural ecology of cetaceans\\", and \\"Ethology of large marine vertebrates\\". He has been guest lecturer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Yale University in the U.S., and at many other academic institutions in Europe and Latin America. Views On marine conservation: good science is essential to conserve the oceans; however conservation is a political endeavour. Without political will, conservation doesn't happen. Bridging science and policy is difficult but doable, and occasionally done; bridging policy and implementation is the real problem, because it is still the exception rather than the rule. Conservation policy is a vital link between science and politics, and maintaining a healthy relationship between scientific objectivity and political advocacy without damaging conservation science‚Äôs credibility is becoming an accepted practice. Through the science- mediated interpretation of empirical observations made in marine habitats, many scientists feel that they are entrusted with this information. It therefore becomes an imperative that carries a moral obligation to do everything possible to ensure that marine spaces are not only identified and studied, but respected and preserved. On the position of humans in the natural world: until about 400,000 years ago, Homo sapiens was just one of the many mammals eking a living in the African savannah, busy finding something to eat while trying to avoid being eaten. In a relatively short time, and in ways now reasonably well understood by anthropologists, we have become technologically savvy to the point that we are now capable of dominating, and likely destroying, the whole planet. Unfortunately humans have been unable to develop, in parallel to their technological prowess, the moral stature necessary to control their brutal strength. This has made of them, essentially, a race of brutes. Having grown increasingly disconnected from nature generation after generation, humans have lost the sense of where they really belong, and most people today think of nature as an optional, to be kept outside of their cosy existence. Sheltered inside the protective cocoon of an imaginary reality, humans see nature mostly as something of a nuisance to be protected against. Alas, the physical world in which we live is still the master, whether we like it or not, so this attitude of natural denial is likely to bring about mankind‚Äôs demise. Furthermore, it is also the cause of the most pernicious indifference and lack of interest for the natural world, and most damningly, of indifference for the damage we increasingly inflict on such world. The ethical consequences of this dystopian approach are staggering. Take for instance human attitude towards non-human animals. The very concept of dualism of humans vs. animals is misleading, as there is no such dualism, and humans are nothing but animals. However, quite conveniently we have convinced ourselves that such dualism is real, so that in our mind we can divide the world between us and all the others. Only we, the humans, are created in the image of God, only we have a soul, only we have an immortal destiny, etc. Everything else is inferior, created by that same God to be at our disposal, and has no rights. Even now that science is telling us what insightful people knew all along, that non-human animals have personalities just like us, are capable of feeling joy and despair, love and fear, can make plans and play politics ‚Äì in a word, are persons in no way different from human persons ‚Äì the dualism persists unabated, as if it were a hard-wired feature of our brains. No matter what, on the one side it is us, with full rights, and on the other it is them, nothing more than some sort of animated things.

He was the Democratic nominee for US Congress in California's 25th district in 2012, and lost in California's top-two primary in June 2014. Rogers is also known as a film producer. Biography =Early life and education= Rogers was born in Elgin, Illinois to George Robert and Madelynn Jean Rogers and moved to Gallatin, Missouri at a young age. He attended primary and secondary school in Gallatin. He was awarded the Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange scholarship and spent his senior year in Uetersen, Germany. Rogers attended Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri from 1996‚Äì2000. He graduated with a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) from Des Moines University College of Podiatric Medicine in 2004 where he was president of the student body. He completed a residency in podiatric medicine and surgery at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in New York, NY and then later a fellowship in limb salvage and research with David G. Armstrong at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in North Chicago, IL. =Des Moines, Iowa= Following his fellowship, Rogers founded and directed the Amputation Prevention Center at Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa. While in Iowa, Rogers described the 6 steps to preventing amputations and published a reduction in major amputations by 72%. Rogers won first place for outstanding research from the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) in 2007 for mesenchymal stem cell research on wounds and 2009 for hi- tech wound measurement techniques. He proposed simple measures to reduce costs of amputations in the healthcare system. =Los Angeles, California= Rogers was recruited to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles in 2009 to co- create the Amputation Prevention Center. In December 2013, Rogers became the executive medical director of the Amputation Prevention Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital. He created a unique inpatient and outpatient facility which greatly improved upon existing limb salvage and wound healing rates by using a team approach with the most modern tools and techniques. In 2014, a medical director of Valley Presbyterian Hospital claimed that Rogers was fired as medical director, which Rogers disputed and he later sued the hospital for breach of contract which led to an undisclosed monetary settlement to Rogers. He founded the Amputation Prevention Centers of America, while medical director of Paradigm Medical Management, a trademark now owned by RestorixHealth, Inc, where he currently serves as medical director. Rogers served as co-director of the Global Diabetic Foot Conference (DFCon) from 2010 to 2013. = Academic work and recognition = Rogers is an Assistant Professor of Podiatric Medicine and Surgery at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, California. has authored more than 150 published articles, books, or book chapters on the lower extremity complications of diabetes, their costs, and health policy. He has delivered more than 500 speeches and his work has brought him to all 50 states and more than 30 countries. In 2009, he became Chair of the Foot Care Council of the American Diabetes Association and his most noted accomplishment was the creation of consensus guidelines for the treatment of Charcot foot which took place at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in Paris, France. The guidelines were jointly published in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association and Diabetes Care and is the most frequently referenced paper on the syndrome. He received the Rising Star Award from the APMA in 2011 for outstanding national accomplishments. In 2013, he received the Master's Award from the American Professional Wound Care Association. Rogers was named by Podiatry Management Magazine as One of America's Most Influential Podiatrists in 2017. He was one of fewer than 20 American podiatrists ever selected as a Fellow of the Faculty of Podiatric Medicine in the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2017. After serving several years on the exam committee, Rogers was elected as a board member of the American Board of Podiatric Medicine, where he founded the Certificate of Added Qualification in Amputation Prevention and Wound Care. The exam was first offered by the Board in 2017. Rogers founded the American Board of Podiatric Medicine - International in 2019, which is the first board exam offered to podiatrists outside the United States. Rogers has been instrumental in defining the role of podiatrists on the healthcare team and within health systems. He co-authored the Toe-Flow Team Guidelines and the Global Vascular Guidelines published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery. He also authored privileging guidelines for podiatrists working in hospitals, supervising hyperbaric oxygen treatment, and the ABPM's position statement on hospital and surgical privileges for podiatrists. Rogers or his work has been quoted in the Wall Street Journal, U.S. News & World Report, the Washington Post, CBS News, and many medical specialty magazines. =Political endeavors= Rogers, a Democrat, ran for US Congress in California‚Äôs 25th district. He lost after giving incumbent Congressman Buck McKeon a strong challenge. After speculation that Congressman Buck McKeon will retire in 2014, Rogers announced his candidacy for the seat again and was endorsed by the Los Angeles Times. Two Republicans edged out Rogers in California's new top two primary for the run off in the June 2014 election. Rogers endorsed Republican Steve Knight over Republican Tony Strickland which drew criticism from the Democratic Party, but Rogers stated, \\"I didn‚Äôt create the rules and I care too much about our district to let it fall to a dishonest carpetbagger who is interested only in himself, like Tony Strickland.\\" He later withdrew his endorsement of Knight over his refusal to ban the sale of the Confederate Flag in the California Capital. He has been highly critical of the American healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry for their focus on profits over patient care. = Filmography = In 2015, Rogers became a producer of films after one of his patients, Stephen Furst, introduced him to the industry.

History The accident involved a school bus carrying students of the Millat Grammar School (located in Millat Town, Faisalabad) who were returning to the city after a school excursion and picnic at Islamabad and Murre via Kallar Kahar and the Khewra Salt Mines (also part of the school trip). While travelling along the M2 motorway, the bus skidded due to mechanical brake failure and fell into a ravine. As many as 37 people died in the disaster and at least 70 were critically injured. According to media sources, the dead civilians included thirty schoolchildren, the bus driver, six school teachers and the vice-principal of the school. The students were in grades six, seven, eight, nine and ten. Those who were injured in the incident were immediately escorted to the district headquarters hospital in Chakwal. The deadly incident immediately received national media coverage in the wake of the high casualties resulting from it. Most of the city remained closed after the district administration and authorities of Faisalabad District announced a day off for all schools, institutions and government jobs following the accident. It has been reported that although the bus had a capacity for only 70 passengers34 killed as school bus overturns in Pakistan, The Hindu it was carrying at least 110 people. Reports suggest the overloaded capacity of the bus may have caused the driver to lose full control of the vehicle and subsequently experience a brake failure. The driver apparently informed the teachers first when the brakes began to fail. The information spread panic and one teacher jumped and landed out of the bus. The vice- principal advised passengers on the bus to remain calm and be prepared to jump out. However, the bus overturned before the passengers could move. According to one student who survived the accident, most of the children were looking towards the teacher who was lying on the road when the bus overturned. The children who were standing while the bus crashed experienced the heaviest casualties. News correspondents reported that the bus was travelling on one of the steepest parts of the motorway.Pakistan bus crash kills children in Punjab province, BBC Pakistan has one of the worst records in traffic accidents and conduct, blamed on poor road infrastructure and faulty vehicles. A police spokesman for National Highways and Motorways disclosed that the bus was an old model, driven by an inexperienced driver who had never reportedly previously travelled on highways. He also acknowledged that there may have been a failure on part of the motorway authorities in properly checking the overloaded bus and remarked that an investigation was being conducted. The 1981 model bus was reconditioned in 2002 and had been given a road-worthiness certificate by the vehicle examination authorities until late December 2011. Concerns and questions were raised as to how an old and unfit bus was still allowed to be operational on the road and how the bus was allowed to be illegally overloaded in excess to its maximum passenger capacity. A large number of families and relatives of the affected victims soon gathered outside the school after listening to the news. Some angry and infuriated people threw stones at district government officials and local parliamentarians who visited the school. It has been reported that the bus had no permit for the Islamabad route on which it was travelling; a transport spokesman said it was mandatory for vehicles to have a permit for the motorway route.Students buried, violation of rules led to fatal bus crash, Dawn Sources said the motorway police had not bothered to take notice of the overloaded bus or check its documents and that the bus had entered from a small interchange where there was no staff deployment and vehicles were not checked. One motorway photographer had reportedly stopped the bus at Kallar Kahar, but allowed it to proceed after the insistence of schoolchildren present in the bus. The official was later suspended. The federal Minister of Communications Arbab Alamgir Khan called up a three-member committee to determine and investigate the causes of the bus accident. The Chief Minister of Punjab Shahbaz Sharif also ordered an inquiry to be conducted.

Life and works  Rossi was born in Rome to a well-to-do family and lived his entire life in the city of his birth. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Collegio Romano distinguishing himself by his extraordinary command of Latin. At the age of 19 he received his laurea in jurisprudence at La Sapienza and in 1603 became a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi. The subsequent misfortunes of his family forced him to enter the legal profession. He remained in a precarious financial position until he received an appointment as secretary to Cardinal Andrea Baroni Peretti Montalto in 1610. After the cardinal's death in 1628 Rossi retired to a small house on the Gianicolo in Rome which became the centre for a circle of his fellow intellectuals including Alessandro Tassoni, Giovanni Ciampoli, Leone Allacci, Gabriel Naud√©, and Fabio Chigi (the future Pope Alexander VII, whom Rossi called \\"Tyrrhenus). The image of Rossi that emerges from writings about him and from his own works is that of a cultured man, a meticulous philologist, and a tolerant thinker. His principal work, Pinacotheca Imaginum Illustrium containing three hundred short biographies of his contemporaries, both men and women, was one of the earliest examples of an Italian literary history, a genre which was to be developed in the 18th century by Ludovico Muratori and Girolamo Tiraboschi.

A meeting with Giacomo Favretto had a marked impact on his early work, which moved towards pleasant genre painting set in Verona. It was in 1880 that his naturalistic output was influenced by a new interest in photography, which was to develop further through contact with the painter Francesco Paolo Michetti during a stay in Rome in 1882. He began to present works at the major national and European exhibitions, enjoying great success with the public and critics alike, in 1883. Participation in the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900 coincided with a renewal of artistic vocabulary through the adoption of elements drawn from Divisionism and Symbolism and a broad awareness of developments on the European scenes. The first urban views, characterised by bright colours and bold contrasts, appeared in this connection. His career reached its peak in 1912 with a solo show of some 80 works within the framework of the Venice Biennale.

A schematics of intracellular calcium signaling and its equivalent from a calcium encoding perspective. Calcium encoding (also referred to as Ca2+ encoding or calcium information processing) is an intracellular signaling pathway used by many cells to transfer, process and encode external information detected by the cell. In cell physiology, external information is often converted into intracellular calcium dynamics. The concept of calcium encoding explains how Ca2+ ions act as intracellular messengers, relaying information within cells to regulate their activity. Given the ubiquity of Ca2+ ions in cell physiology, Ca2+ encoding has also been suggested as a potential tool to characterize cell physiology in health and disease. The mathematical bases of Ca2+ encoding have been pioneered by work of Joel Keizer and Hans G. Othmer on calcium modeling in the 1990s and more recently they have been revisited by Eshel Ben-Jacob, Herbert Levine and co-workers. AM, FM and AFM calcium encoding Elementary modes of calcium encoding. AM, FM and AFM encoding Ca2+ oscillations correspond to analogous modulations in electronic communications. Although elevations of Ca2+ are necessary for it to act as a signal, prolonged increases of the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm can be lethal for the cell. Thus cells avoid death usually delivering Ca2+ signals as brief transients - i.e. Ca2+ elevations followed by a rapid decay - or in the form of oscillations. In analogy with Information Theory, either the amplitude or the frequency or both features of these Ca2+ oscillations define the Ca2+ encoding mode. Therefore, three classes of Ca2+ signals can be distinguished on the basis of their encoding mode: ** AM encoding Ca2+ signals: when the strength of the stimuli is encoded by amplitude modulations of Ca2+ oscillations. In other words, stimuli of the same nature but of different strength are associated with different amplitudes of Ca2+ oscillations but the frequencies of these oscillations are similar; ** FM encoding Ca2+ signals: when the strength of the stimuli is encoded by frequency modulations of Ca2+ oscillations. In other words, stimuli of the same nature but of different strength are associated with different frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations but the amplitudes of these oscillations are similar; ** AFM encoding Ca2+ signals: when both AM and FM encoding modes coexist. Experiments and biophysical modeling, show that the mode of calcium encoding varies from cell to cell, and that a given cell could even show different types of calcium encoding for different patho-physiological conditions. This could ultimately provide a crucial tool in medical diagnostics, to characterize, recognize and prevent diseases. Mathematical aspects of calcium encoding Calcium encoding can be mathematically characterized by biophysical models of calcium signaling. Phase plane and bifurcation analysis of these models, can reveal in fact how frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillations vary as a function of any parameter of the model. Occurrence of AM-, FM- or AFM-encoding can be assessed on the extension of the min-max range of amplitude and frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and the bifurcation structure of the system under study. Stimulus integration. Only if the stimulus allows accumulation (i.e. integration) of IP3 up to a certain threshold then a FM-encoding Ca2+ oscillation occurs. A critical aspect of Ca2+ encoding revealed by modeling, is how it depends on the dynamics of the complex network of reactions of underlying Ca2+-mobilizing signals. This aspect can be addressed considering Ca2+ models that include both Ca2+ dynamics and the dynamics of Ca2+-mobilizing signals. One simple and biophysically realistic model of this kind is the ChI model, originally developed by Eshel Ben-Jacob and co-workers, for GPCR-mediated inositol 1,4,5 trisphospate (IP3)-triggered Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. The main conclusion of this study was that the dynamics of the Ca2+-mobilizing IP3 signal is essentially AFM encoding with respect to the stimulus whereas Ca2+ oscillations can be either FM or AFM but not solely AM. It was argued that the AFM nature of the Ca2+-mobilizing IP3 signal could represent the ideal solution to optimally translate pulsed or discontinuous extracellular signals into intracellular continuous-like Ca2+ oscillations. Computational aspects Calcium encoding can be confined within a single cell or involve cell ensembles and deploy essential computational tasks, such as stimulus integration or regulated activation of gene transcription. Moreover, cells are often organized in networks, allowing intercellular propagation of calcium signaling. With this regard, the same mode of calcium encoding could be shared by different cells, providing synchronization or the functional basis to implement more complex computational tasks. Michael Forrest has shown that intracellular calcium dynamics may permit a Purkinje neuron to perform toggle and gain computations upon its inputs. So, showing how an ion concentration can be used as a computational variable - in particular, as a memory element: recording a history of firing and inputs, to dictate how the neuron responds to future inputs. Thus, this work hypothesizes that the membrane potential (V) is not the Purkinje cell's only coding variable but works alongside a calcium memory system. These two interact, with the calcium memory being encoded and decoded by the membrane potential. The toggle and gain computations are likely to be salient to network computations in the cerebellum, in the brain. Thus, ion computations can be important more globally than a single cell. Forrest terms this hypothesis: \\"ion to network computation\\".

History left left Valle Cavanata was historically a fish farming area created in the 1920s, in the eastern part of the lagoon of Grado, that was embanked and provided with adjustable floodgates and thus transformed into a brackish area for fish farming. The water level in Valle Cavanata can be modified by the sluice gates; they allow the water to flood the area at high tide or let it out at low tide. The 'lavoriere' was used for fishing‚Äîa metallic grid where the fishes were trapped. An extensive type of fish rearing has always been practised in Valle Cavanata. The fish farming activities were maintained until 1995; after which, the management of the water levels in the Valle Cavanata has been oriented to favor the bird fauna especially. The Valle Cavanata Regional Nature Reserve is under the management of the Authority for Parks and Regional Forests of the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The presence of several environments between the sea and the mainland (lagoon, beach, wood, meadow, fishing valley, pond) makes it an ideal place for the permanent habitat of several species of birds, while others spend only the winter here. 260 bird species have been identified. Valle Cavanata Reserve has been declared a wetland of international value by the Ramsar Convention, it is a Site of Community Importance (SCI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA).

The South 24 Parganas district is divided into two distinct physiographic zones: the marine-riverine delta in the north and the marine delta zone in the south. As the sea receded southwards, in the sub-recent geological period, a large low lying plain got exposed. Both tidal inflows and the rivers have been depositing sediments in this plain. The periodical collapse of both the natural levees and man-made embankments speed up the process of filling up of the depressions containing brackish water wetlands. The marine delta in the south is formed of interlacing tidal channels. As non-saline water for irrigation is scarce, agriculture is monsoon dominated. Some parts of the wetlands are still preserved for raising fish. The Thakurpukur Mahestala CD block has an area of 63.08 km2.

In the 15th to 17th centuries the Astrakhan Tatars inhabited the Astrakhan Khanate (1459‚Äì1556), which was also inhabited by the Nogai Horde, and the Astrakhan Tatars experienced a profound effect on Nogais. Since the 17th century there has been an increased interaction and ethnic mixing of the Astrakhan Tatars with Kazan Tatars. Compare: Population The Astrakhan Tatars (around 80,000) are a group of Tatars, descendants of the Astrakhan Khanate's population, who live mostly in Astrakhan Oblast. For the Russian Census in 2010, most Astrakhan Tatars declared themselves simply as Tatars and few declared themselves as Astrakhan Tatars. A large number of Volga Tatars live in Astrakhan Oblast and differences between them have been disappearing. Text from Britannica 1911: :The Astrakhan Tatars number about 10,000 and are, with the Kalmyks, all that now remains of the once so powerful Astrakhan empire. They also are agriculturists and gardeners. While Astrakhan (√Ñsterxan) Tatar is a mixed dialect, around 43,000 have assimilated to the Middle (i.e., Kazan) dialect. Their ancestors are Kipchaks, Khazars and some Volga Bulgars. (Volga Bulgars had trade colonies in modern Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts of Russia.)

In 1614 he took up also the study of Arabic at the University of Leyden where he made the acquaintance of Thomas Erpenius. In 1616 he became professor of literature and oriental languages at Franeker. Subsequently, however, he was suspected of Arianism, and underwent an investigation by Sibrandus Lubbertus and Johannes Bogerman (1576-1637). Bogerman was a Calvinist theologian who was the Ecclesiastical President of the Synod of Dort (1618-1619). When Erpenius died in 1625, Amama was called to take his place, however the Estates of Friesland refused permission for him to leave, but did increase his remuneration. He died in Franeker.

Available as a kit or complete aircraft, it has been in production since 1994 by Humbert Aviation of Ramonchamp. Design and development The T√©tras was first seen in public in 1992 at the RSA Rally at Moulins and marketing began in 1994. It is a conventionally laid out single engine, tractor configuration light aircraft with a high wing, side-by-side seating for two and a fixed undercarriage. Its straight non tapered wing is a composite structure, with an aluminium frame, Styrofoam filling and fabric covering. The ailerons and three-position flaps are made of aluminium. The wings are braced on each side with a single lift strut to a lower fuselage longeron. The tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage height, is also strut braced. The fuselage of the T√©tras is a steel structure covered with Dacron. Variants with both tricycle and conventional undercarriages, all fixed, have been built. The former arrangement has spring cantilever main legs, the latter has the mainwheels mounted on faired V-strut legs and bungee sprung half axles fixed to a compression frame. Both undercarriage variants have hydraulic brakes. Skis may also be fitted. The T√©tras has been fitted with a variety of engines; originally the 54 kW (72 hp) Humbert-Volkswagen HW 2000 was used.

The soundtrack of the film was arranged by Shailendra Swapnil.http://telugu.16reels.com/movies/Madhyanam+Hatya- Movie_Details_Synopsis_Cast_Crew.aspx The film was remade in Hindi as My Wife's Murder.  Plot  A Police Inspector (Bhanuchander) is assigned to investigate the case of the dead woman whose body is recovered from a lake. The cop checks if this matter can be linked with a missing persons' report filed by a film editor Ravi Kumar (J. D. Chakravarthy) and his father-in-law. The dead woman is identified as Lakshmi (Aamani), Ravi's nagging and abusive wife, whom Ravi kills and packs the dead body in a carton box and dumps the box into a river in the city's outskirts. According to Ravi, Lakshmi had left their home to go to visit her parents. When she had not arrived at their house 24 hours later, he himself had gone to their house, and on not being able to locate her, had accompanied his father-in-law to the nearest police station and filed a report as she is missing. The cop concludes that Lakshmi was waylaid on her way to her parents' house by person(s) unknown, beaten, and her body was left in the pond. But this case puzzles him, as there was no apparent motive for unknown person(s) to waylay her, as no money was taken, and her body does not shown any signs of sexual molestation. Taking these facts into consideration, The cop starts to suspect Ravi. Ravi's assistant (Priyanka Kothari) tries to help Ravi. However, her involvement makes the matter worse.

Ranking behind only Austin Robertson, Jr., Tyson is the second-greatest goalkicker in the various incarnations of what is now the WAFL, having kicked 1,197 goals in his 228-game career. Tyson came from a leading Western Australian footballing family; his uncle Charlie Tyson played for Collingwood and North Melbourne Football Clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL), while his grandfather, father and four other uncles also played football to a high standard.Atkinson, Brian; West Perth Football Club 1885-1985; p. 130. He debuted for the Cardinals in 1930 and kicked over fifty goals despite the club winning only six and drawing one of its eighteen games. The following year, Tyson established a permanent position at full forward and kicked eighty-one goals, which at the time was the fifth-highest total in league history.Atkinson; p. 47. Published 1985 by Acton Press 1932 saw Tyson move further with ninety-six goals, equalling Sol Lawn's record from three seasons beforehand. To cap it off, Tyson produced an outstanding display with eight goals in the Grand Final, a record for a WANFL Grand Final not beaten until Eric Gorman in 1963. The following season, Tyson made four appearances for Western Australia in interstate football, all at the 1933 Sydney Carnival, where he kicked thirteen goals.Devaney, John; Full Points Footy‚Äôs WA Football Companion; p. 312. However, the emergence of ‚Äôs George Doig put paid to Tyson's ambitions for regular interstate representation. Doig's 152 goals in 1934 saw him take over the full-forward position for the state team until the pair were forced into virtual retirement by World War II. Between 1933 and 1937, although Tyson kicked over 100 goals four times, Doig invariably beat him for the league's leading goal-kicker award and the full forward position in the State's team. Nonetheless, Tyson played in two further Cardinal premiership teams in 1934 and 1935, and in 1938 managed to head the WANFL goalkicking with 126 goals, a figure made more remarkable because the once-powerful Cardinals had fallen to clear last on the ladder with only three wins. In the last match of that season Tyson kicked 17.5 of a team total of 18.7 against Swan Districts, which is the most goals for a losing side in senior Australian Rules football.Atkinson, Graeme and Hanlon, Michael; 3AW Book of Footy Records: All the Great Players, Matches, Goals, Kicks, Brawls and Sensations from More Than 100 Years of Aussie Rules in Australia; p. 138. The 1939 season was even worse for the Cardinals, who had lost twenty-seven successive matches before their only win late in the season, in which Tyson kicked his thousandth goal during the final quarter.‚ÄúLEAGUE FOOTBALL: East Fremantle‚Äôs Pace.

He formed a superb combination with Bill Baker in that match, and after the under-age competition of 1942 to 1944 ended, made another brief comeback during 1945.

Gough devised and constructed a wooden housing for a loudspeaker unit which importantly also acted as an acoustic chamber, rather in the way that the body of a violin serves as a sound box for the strings. Challenging the dominant acoustic theories of his day and opposed by some major loudspeaker manufacturers,The Observer, 27 November 1960. Gough decided to publish and sell his own plans for the construction of the enclosure, which proved very popular in this do-it-yourself era and many thousands of copies were purchased by hi-fi enthusiasts worldwide.Western Mail, 20 October 1960 The Jabez Gough Enclosure was first demonstrated publicly on 19 October 1960, in Tongwynlais, South Wales. The event quickly attracted national publicity. In a front-page article for The Observer on 27 November, Peter Schirmer declared that a Gough enclosure, fitted with a single 12-inch loudspeaker unit, \\"could fill St Pauls Cathedral with almost perfect high fidelity sound.\\" Gough subsequently took a pair of his enclosures to demonstrate in London's famous Covent Garden Opera House. Powered by a single 15 watt valve (tube) amplifier, and fitted with two eight-inch loudspeaker units, the Jabez Gough Enclosures managed to fill the opera house with sound.Quoted in the Gough Speaker Archive, www.gough-speakers.co.uk Jabez Gough patented his invention in August 1961,UK Patent No: 912430 but no large-scale manufacture of the units ever took place, largely because Gough himself was not interested in commercial development of the idea. Nevertheless, word of the invention spread far and wide around the world; and by November 1961, the Popular Science magazine in America published a feature article on the phenomenon.Popular Science, November 1961, p167 Meanwhile, in the UK, Gough's invention was the focus for a popular BBC television programme in the 'How to Make it' series, in July 1961. By 1973 some 35,000 copies of the construction plans for the enclosure had been sold around the world.When Hi-Fi Hit the Headlines, Doug Church, Audio Magazine, December 1973. One specialist commentator wrote at this time that the Gough Enclosure, and its revolutionary design, was \\"one of the biggest controversies the hi-fi world has known.\\" Measuring almost six feet square, the Jabez Gough Enclosure inevitably lost popularity as portability and miniaturisation of audio systems took hold in the eighties and nineties. Now in the modern digital era, the Gough loudspeaker is all but extinct. However, Gough's legacy is still not quite forgotten as fifty years later his work is still the subject of public controversy, as is witnessed in a recent feature in Hi-Fi News.Golly Gough!

The owner-managed company has its headquarters in Herne. The company now operates in more than 50 countries and has 20 subsidiary companies, 51 representative offices and six manufacturing facilities worldwide. History 1889 VULKAN's history began following the foundation of Maschinenfabrik Louis Schwarz in Dortmund. The company initially functioned as a supplier of brewing equipment, tanks and low pressure compressors for the already well-established Dortmund breweries. 1898 The world's first clutch, which was capable of being activated under load, was produced for use in lifting machinery, hoists and reversing gearboxes. It was manufactured by Luis Schwarz and it marked the beginning of VULKAN couplings. 1918 The merger of Maschinenfabrik Luis Schwarz and the company Heinrich Behrend resulted in the establishment of Dortmunder VULKAN AG. 1930 The flourishing construction of couplings and transmission units for ships was separated from ‚ÄúDortmunder VULKAN AG‚Äù and made autonomous under the name ‚ÄúVULKAN Kupplungs- und Getriebebau GmbH‚Äù. 1941 Maschinenfabrik HACKFORTH & Co. took over the production from VULKAN Kupplungs- und Getriebebau GmbH. This resulted in the foundation stone for the co-operation between ‚ÄùVULKAN‚Äù and ‚ÄúHACKFORTH‚Äù being laid. 1945 All commercial and technical installations of VULKAN (in Dortmund) and HACKFORTH (in Herne) were destroyed during a World War II air-raid. The reconstruction of Maschinenfabrik HACKFORTH & Co. in Wanne-Eickel commenced immediately after the war. 1967 VULKAN was entrusted with the construction of the largest highly flexible couplings that had ever been built - the EZ 560 - with a nominal torque of 981 kNm. 1978 Foundation of VULKAN LOKRING Rohrverbindungen GmbH & Co. KG, the headquarters of which were and remain located in Herne. The company is engaged in the development, production and marketing of solder free tube connections for air conditioning and refrigeration. 1982 VULKAN Kupplungs- und Getriebebau developed a coupling with an extremely high torsional flexibility, which bore the name RATO. Following this, the manufacturing of the patent-registered RATO S coupling began. 2005 VULKAN Kupplungs- und Getriebebau established an in-house vulcanisation ensuring the control, knowhow and reproducible quality of a core process. From natural rubber elastomer the vulcanization produces components with volumes from 0.4 to 140 litres for all highly flexible couplings. 2008 To harmonise the global range of products and to optimise the marketing strategy, the business of the VULKAN group was divided into the following four business divisions: VULKAN Couplings, VULKAN Drive Tech, VULKAN Lokring. 2010 VULKAN Couplings established the ACOTEC (Advanced Couplings Technology) strategy. ACOTEC is an integrated approach bringing together all competences in-house, ensuring that the best possible products and services can be provided. The divisions The Hackforth Holding GmbH & Co. KG is the management company of the VULKAN Group, it consists of the VULKAN subsidiaries, VULKAN Kupplungs- und Getriebebau B. Hackforth GmbH & Ko. kg and VULKAN Lokring Rohrverbindungen GmbH & Ko. kg. The head office of the group is located in Herne, Germany. Production and sales activities within the VULKAN Group are organized by division because of the diversified business portfolio. The three divisions - VULKAN Couplings, VULKAN Drive Tech, VULKAN Lokring - each have their own product range and independent control of their market activities. Nevertheless, the individual divisions work together in one market sector to produce synergies which make it possible to provide integrated solutions. *VULKAN Couplings: highly flexible couplings, damper, mounts, shafts for maritime applications and stationary energy generation *VULKAN Drive Tech: couplings, dampers, mounts, brakes for industrial applications *VULKAN Lokring: tube connections in the field of cooling/air conditioning technology External links * Official website *MV Ross Revenge Vulkan Coupling * Company Profile at NIRO * VULKAN Couplings best√ºckt erste marine Anwendung des MAN -TCS PTG * VULKAN ‚Äì High tech from Herne for the worldwide market  Category:Engineering companies of Germany ","title":"Vulkan Group"},{"id":"33227040","text":"Felipe Zetter Zetter (3 July 1923 ‚Äì 15 March 2013) was a Mexican football defender who played for Mexico national team in the 1950 FIFA World Cup.1950 FIFA World Cup Brazil Career Zetter played as a defender for Club Atlas, captaining the side to its only Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n championship in 1951.

Its north border was Yewtree Lane. Its southeast border was a little northwest of Altrincham Road (Styal). * Local roads relevant to this account, on the map below: ** Yewtree Lane: the lane from the junction by Firtree Farm west to The Grange (east of the crossroads marked \\"Ringway\\"), and continuing northwest past Manor Farm to the next junction. ** Altrincham Road (Styal): the lane from Oversleyford running northeast then east into the Styal area. In World War II, it was the location of RAF Ringway, and was important in the production and repair of military aircraft and training parachutists. After World War II, it gradually expanded to its present size, including massive expansion of aprons, runways and car parking areas. Among the first expansions was car parking and service buildings north of Yewtree Lane. From 1958 to late 1962, Terminal 1 was built: this was the first of Ringway's modern large terminals and the first major public building north of Yewtree Lane. In 1997, the second runway was planned and construction on it started, with protests about it intruding on woodland in the Styal area. Local airfield history Manchester, England, has been served since 1911 by the following airfields: * Trafford Park Aerodrome, in operation 1911‚Äì18, owned by a company. Now built-over. * Alexandra Park Aerodrome, in operation 1918‚Äì24, built on land owned by the Egerton Estate between Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Now playing fields and built-over. * Woodford Aerodrome, owned by A.V.Roe in NE Cheshire, from 1924. * Wythenshawe Aerodrome, the first municipally-owned airport at Manchester, 1929‚Äì1930.

The site for the planned airport was at the time in the Cheshire parish of Ringway (as it was south of the River Mersey). Its north border was Yewtree Lane. Its southeast border was a little northwest of Altrincham Road (Styal). * 28 November 1935: Construction was ceremonially started by the Lord Mayor. * 17 May 1937: The first aeroplane landed at Ringway, which was partly built and all grass: a de Havilland Hornet Moth G-ADND, flown by Duncan Menzies, a Fairey Aviation test pilot, was over where Wythenshawe is now and intended to land at Barton Aerodrome, but could not find Sale and the Manchester Ship Canal (landmarks on the way to Barton) because of fog, so he landed at another airfield (Ringway, then incomplete) which he saw.BBC TV channel 1 news 6.30 to 7.00 pm 17 May 2012; ; ; * 8 June 1937: The first (westerly) part of the airfield, with an assembly hangar, was officially opened for use by Fairey Aviation.Scholefield, 1998, p. 35 * Early summer 1938: The airport was completed for civil aviation use. * 25 June 1938 : The airport and its terminal building were officially opened with a public air display that included civil and RAF aircraft and on 27 JuneScholefield, 1998, p. 10 handled its first scheduled flight, a KLM operated Douglas DC-2 to Amsterdam. The airport at this time was called Ringway, after the parish it was within. Pre-war, KLM was the only international operator out of Ringway and offered a request stop at Doncaster. The terminal building was the westernmost of the large buildings and incorporated the control tower, administration, restaurant, and hangar: it was later numbered Hangar 1. *1938: 4,000 passengers used the airport. * January‚ÄìAugust 1939: 4000 passengers used the airport, before declaration of war brought an end to civil operations.

Image taken from a little south of west. (After World War II they were renumbered 2,3,4.) * Link to image of passenger terminal, 1938, just opened World War II * 1939: Construction of the Royal Air Force station RAF Ringway began on the north east edge of the airfield. It was used for operational flying and training. The main user was No.1 Parachute Training School RAF which trained over 60,000 paratroopers between June 1940 and March 1946. The trainees parachuted over Tatton Park, after receiving permission from the land owner, Lord Egerton. A complex of hangars and assembly sheds on the northwest side of the airfield was used by Fairey Aviation to build, modify and test over 4,000 aircraft. From spring 1939, Avro used the 1938-built main hangar (former passenger terminal) for assembly and testing the prototype Avro Manchester, Avro Lancaster and Avro Lincoln bombers. * 1939: No. 613 (City of Manchester Squadron) had its home base at RAF Ringway. * Late 1939: Fairey built two temporary south-side hangars (numbered 6 and 7) along Altrincham Road (Styal) to store completed Fairey Battle aircraft. * 1939-1940: Two hangars were built in the northwest corner of the airfield for use by Fairey Aviation. They still exist, one used for aircraft maintenance and the other for ground operations. * Winter 1940-1941: The advent of heavier aircraft types resulted in the all-grass landing area being badly damaged in wet weather. The ruts froze during cold weather, damaging the undercarriages of taxiing aircraft. * June‚ÄìDecember 1941: Two asphalt runways of length were therefore hastily laid down. The runways were designated 06/24 and 10/28. * 1941 or earlier: The hangars were given their first numbering system. * Late 1942: The temporary south-side hangars 6 and 7 were removed. * 1942/1943: Three large permanent southside hangars (numbered 521, 522, 523) were built to Ministry of Aircraft Production designs and used for the assembly of Avro York military transport aircraft along the northwest side of Altrincham Road (Styal). (After the war they were used for various purposes including overhaul of Canadair Sabres by Airwork Ltd, by private pilot owners and a flying school. In the mid-1990s Runway 2 obliterated them.) * January 1943: By then Runway 06/24 was lengthened to to accommodate the four-engined aircraft using RAF Ringway and the Runway 02/20 was constructed. Runways 02/20 and 10/28 ceased to be used by airliners by the mid-1950s, but 10/28 was used by light aircraft for another 30 years. Both are permanently out of use. * 1943: Another north-side hangar (later number 5) was built for the Parachute Training School for ground training. Some time after this, the hangars were renumbered. In World War II, aircraft dispersal and work areas with hard standings were built outside the old airfield area: north of Yewtree Lane by Fairey's area, and southeast of Altrincham Road (Styal) by the three southeast hangars. These were linked to by \\"level crossings\\" across those two roads, which were closed to the public except to those with a local resident's pass from early 1940 to mid 1945. After the war these hard standings were removed and the land was returned to farming, and the two roads became public again. Airfield buildings as at end of World War II At the end of the war the airfield had these buildings (In the pairs of hangar numbers, the first number is the hangar's original number and the second is its later renumbering.): * Northside: along the south side of the east part of Yewtree Lane and of the west end of Ringway Road, from west to east: ** big, with white walls: Hangar 1/2, built in 1938; \\"MANCHESTER RINGWAY\\" on its flat roof: until WWII, and after the RAF left it until 1949, was the terminal building; the RAF held onto it for some time after WWII ended. ** big, black: Hangar 2/3: a Bellman hangar, built in mid 1939: in World War II used by Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). *** north of #2/3: a roadside square of about 6 old buildings (Firtree Farm: see :File:Aa oldwythenshawe 00.jpg), reused as airfield buildings); sheds ** big, black: Hangar 3/4: a Bellman hangar, built early in World War II: in World War II used by Parachute Training School for ground training. *** north of #3/4: sheds. **- - - All the above were swept away before Terminal 1 opened, to enable a new apron to be created and to enable its passenger piers be built. ** Hangar -/5: a Bellman hangar, built early WW2 but after the first numbering, removed in 1954 to allow for a domestic apron extension. ** big, black: Hangar 4/6, erected in 1939-40 and used by No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF for ground training. ** big, black: Hangar 5/7, built in 1939-40 and used by No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF for aircraft maintenance. * At northwest: ** Fairey Aviation's buildings. ** A hangar whose later number was 1. * At southeast: 3 hangars (numbered 521, 522, 523) as described above. :See also RAF Ringway. After World War II: back to civilian use Pier B of the 1962 Terminal (now Terminal 1) in summer 1964 showing the angled parking then used and a Dan-Air Douglas Dakota, KLM Vickers Viscount and Dan-Air Airspeed Ambassador. The public viewing terrace on the pier is visible After World War II the airport grew massively. * 1946-1957: No. 613 Squadron RAF (City of Manchester Squadron) had its home base at RAF Ringway using Hangar No.7, and flew Supermarine Spitfires and De Havilland Vampire jet fighters in its fighter role as a unit within the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. * The buildings at the western end of the complex, including the control tower, were returned to civilian use. Externally they were rendered and painted in art-deco style, to give a modern appearance. Internally a passenger terminal was fitted out, including a glass-walled observation restaurant facing the apron. As a public relations exercise, space was allocated within the lower tower as a club room for the Ringway Spotters Club. This branch of the Ian Allan-inspired hobby of aircraft spotting later changed its name to Society of Northern Aeronautical Enthusiasts, rapidly becoming known by its initials, SNAE. Members sported an enamel badge similar to the BOAC Bluebird but in red in place of blue. These spotters and the general public were catered for by a large viewing enclosure, adjacent to the western end of the building. They were provided with a more modest cafe, in the form of a large single-storey prefabricated building. Near this cafe, a small gate in the chain link fence, which kept the public off the apron, gave access to those wanting to take a pleasure flight. These were provided by Airviews Ltd. who operated an Auster monoplane, and two De Havilland biplanes (a Dragon Rapide and a Fox Moth. Five shillings (now 25p) bought you a flight around Wythenshawe. * 28 October 1953: The first trans-Atlantic schedule commenced using Douglas DC-6Bs began, operated by Sabena Belgian World Airlines to New York's Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport). * 1 April 1952: 24-hour operation was introduced. * 1954: The airport handled its millionth passenger since the Second World War. The hangar whose later number was 5, was removed, to allow a westerly extension of the main apron for domestic airline traffic. * March 1957: 613 Squadron (and all other Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadrons) were disbanded. RAF Ringway was closed and its hangars and other buildings were handed over for civil airline operations including cargo and maintenance. *The passenger terminal, at the western end, was closed down and a new temporary terminal was converted from the old RAF buildings, in preparation for the start of the rebuild. Check-in was in a converted hangar and adopted the now familiar layout. The main difference from today was that not just the luggage was weighed. All passengers too, were required to stand on the big Avery scales, and were charged accordingly. The departure lounge, known as the Traffic Hall, was converted from one of the big brick \\"H\\" blocks. Along with comfortable seating, the lounge contained a long bar, backed by a full length, brightly coloured, three-dimensional collage. On a table, in the centre of the hall, was a large display case containing an architect's model of how the new airport would look. The modernity was even taken into the toilets, which had the first warm-air hand driers. Outside, the remainder of the ex RAF buildings became the Freight Village. A new but smaller viewing enclosure was allocated adjacent to the west end of the new terminal. No cafe, no toilets, just a bare rectangle of concrete. The chain link fence was usually lined with bicycles, which were regularly blown over when the BEA and Dan-Air DC3 Dakotas opened up both engines before turning right and taxiing out. No push-back then. No steerable nose wheels either. Just full power and hard right rudder. Start of the modern terminals * 1958: Start of building the current Terminal 1, adjacent to the north side of Yewtree Lane, north of Hangars 1/2 to 3/4. The east part of Yewtree Lane was closed to the public and enclosed in the airport, and became an airport internal road, with vehicle passages under the north ends of Terminal 1's piers. Its east end became an airport entry. (Before this, an airport car park developed north of Yewtree Lane, as more passengers came without a chauffeur and so had to leave their cars at the airport while they were away; also airport auxiliary buildings.) * 1958: By then the airport was handling 500,000 passengers annually.Scholefield, 1998, p. 156 * 23 April 1958: Another main runway extension (from to 7,000 ft) was opened on permitting regular non-stop scheduled flights to North America. For about 6 to 12 months after this, the A538 road ran across the runway with gates or traffic lights like a level crossing and was shut whenever an aeroplane crossed it, while a new route for the A538 was built. *1958 to 1962: Several north-side buildings of the old airfield along the south side of Yewtree Lane were removed, as they would have interfered with functioning of the new Terminal 1. Firtree Farm, which had survived used as airfield buildings, was where the north end of Terminal 1's east pier is. * Late 1962: Terminal 1, the airport's first purpose-built post- war terminal, was opened; Manchester was then the only airport in Europe to have aircraft piers. **Google Earth view showing at centre what may be a remnant of a former route of the A538 (Altrincham to Wilmslow) road left stranded by runway lengthenings The widebody era and further expansion This BOAC Boeing 747 was the first widebody airliner to arrive at the airport on 17 August 1970 * 1968: Construction started on the M56 motorway, and it opened to Manchester Airport in 1972. (Conditions where it crossed Hasty Lane were unsuitable for a vehicle bridge, so the underbridge there is for pedestrians and bicycles only, and a cart track called Runger Lane from Yewtree Lane near its northwest end to the A538 road was made into a road to restore the connection. Some time after this, the part of Outwood Lane west of the M56 junction was renamed as part of Thorley Lane.) * 1970: The first widebody airliner arrived at the airport on 17 August when BOAC brought their Boeing 747 to test Ringway's facilities for the typeScholefield, 1998, p.93 * 1974: A Local Government Review placed the airport entirely within the city of Manchester boundaries in the new metropolitan Greater Manchester area. However, due to constant expansion of the airport it had expanded back into Cheshire by the early 1980s. The airport has since expanded farther into Cheshire, mainly because the second runway is almost entirely in Cheshire. * 1975: The airport decided to drop the name \\"Ringway\\" and renamed the airport \\"Manchester International Airport\\" severing links with the RAF past and the village after which the airport was named, a title retained until 1 April 1986 when it reverted to Manchester Airport, it having been patently obvious that the airport was international.Scholefield, 1998, p. 94 * 17 August 1982: Opening of main runway extension to its current length of to attract long- haul flights from worldwide destinations. The A538 road from Altrincham to Wilmslow had to be diverted further south to a tunnel under the runway; the cut ends of its old course became airport back gates. This extension work (and building Runway Two later) needed heavy earthworks in the Bollin river valley, as the flat area around the original Ringway is much smaller than the flat area around Heathrow near London. This road diversion ran south of the locally well-known Oversleyford Brickworks, which was south of the original course of the A538 road. (The brickworks later closed and was demolished and its site fell down to wild vegetation and became an unofficial motorcycle scrambling ground. Land to the north of it to the west of Altrincham Road (Styal) became an unofficial planespotting area.) * 1980s: The airport was designated an \\"international gateway\\". * 1980s: The northwest side of Altrincham Road (Styal) was lined with a high embankment with dense trees planted on, to prevent aircraft spotting, due to a fear of use by terrorists' lookout men. (The remaining part of Altrincham Road (Styal) runs west from Hollin Lane (B5166 road) into the Styal area.) 3 terminals * 1986: The World Freight Terminal (Manchester Airport goods area) opened. Building it expanded the airport westwards, taking up land around The Grange lane-junction and obliterating most of the west remnant of Yewtree Lane and the north part of Pinfold Lane. * 1988: The airport celebrated its Golden Jubilee and by this time was handling 9.5 million passengers annually. Due to increasing passenger numbers a second terminal was soon needed. * May 1989: Terminal 1A Domestic (later renamed Terminal 3) was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales. * Early 1990s: The western longterm car parking area was made or greatly enlarged, and aircraft standing area was enlarged, obliterating Etrop Green Farm (which was demolished in 1989) and its road-junction and trees and pond, and Fields Farm. Runger Lane was extended northwards to bypass this car park area and join Thorley Lane, which was rerouted to the north. A brick barn of Etrop Green Farm survived for a time fenced off among the car parking. The east end of this car parking area obliterated Woodhouse Farm. * Early 1990s: Car parking was much expanded eastwards across Shadow Moss, and obliterated Heyhead (a group of old houses and a shop and a chapel) despite a protest group. Two old cottages were left on the north side of the west end of the old Ringway Road due to preservation orders, but they have now disappeared. * May 1992: An official Aviation Viewing Park was created just off the A538 road on the south-western side of the airfield. This replaced the unofficial Oversleyford plane-spotting area. * 1993: Terminal 2 opened. Railway station * 1993: Manchester Airport railway station opened, connecting the airport to the national rail network. It is the terminus of a spur line west from the railway line from Manchester through Styal to Wilmslow and Crewe. Second runway * 1997: Planning permission was granted on 15 January for Manchester's \\"Runway Two\\", now Runway 23L/05R (the fourth runway to be constructed on the airport site) and work started the same year.Scholefield, 1998, p. 133 The resulting intrusion onto woodland in the Styal area caused public reaction and protest camps. The new runway had to be embanked over the A538 road, which now runs through tunnels under both runways; this needed heavy earthworks, and a temporary railway was built into the southern edge of the airport to carry trains with limestone aggregates from Derbyshire. It obliterated the Oversleyford Brickworks site, which had become a wildlife area. It cut Altrincham Road (Styal) and obliterated farms in the Oversleyford area, and as a result traffic that used that road now must go a long way round through the centre of Wilmslow; the lost section has been replaced by a path along the Bollin river valley passable by pedal cycle or horse but not with a powered vehicle. The cut ends of this road are now airport back gates. The river Bollin goes through a culvert under the new runway. *:During this construction there were important prehistoric finds at Oversley Farm (which is now under Runway Two): see Oversleyford#Oversley Farm. * June 1998, British Airways opened their new ¬£75 million terminal facility designed by Grimshaw Architects, a major extension to Terminal 3; they and their partner airlines were the primary users of Terminal 3 Aircraft stands at Terminal 3 * 5 February 2001: Runway Two opened at a cost of ¬£172 million and was the first full-length commercial runway to open in the UK for over 20 years.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1377921/Manchesters-second- runway-ready-for-take-off.html 21st century * 2004: Another milestone was achieved: the airport reached 20 million passengers a year. * 2004: The new ¬£60 million integrated public transport interchange was opened (called \\"The Station\\"), bringing bus, coach and rail passengers under one roof. Manchester Airport was to be adapted to accept Airbus A380 aircraft, as part of the larger expansion at the airport and would be certified as a diversion aerodrome for A380 flights. * Evening of 6 June 2007: The signs on taxiways and entrances to the runway were changed to follow the direction reassignments. The runway designators changed at the same time. * 7 June 2007: at 00:00 UTC (01:00 BST), Manchester Airport's runway assignments were changed in relation to the magnetic compass bearings. The previous headings for the runways were 056¬∞ and 236¬∞ with assignments 06L/24R and 06R/24L respectively. The new headings for the runways are 054¬∞ and 234¬∞ with new assignments of 05L/23R and 05R/23L respectively. * January 2009: By now the only surviving building from RAF Ringway was the Officers Mess (Building 217) in Ringway Road and until recently used as the Airport Archive. * Late 2009: After a terrorism scare, the layout of Departures at Terminal 1 was changed: the only part accessible without going through security is a passage across the front where the airlines' ticket offices are. The former big hall has been divided into lounges and passages at two levels. The well-known big chandeliers from that hall are now in a museum in Manchester. This alteration caused loss of the indoors not-security-cleared through route between Terminal 1 and the domestic terminal. * March 2010: Emirates announced that they would start daily A380 flights on one of their two daily flights from Manchester to Dubai, the service began on 1 September 2010. * 2011: The airport took over Cloughbank Farm (between the aviation viewing area and the Ringway chapel crossroads) and began using it as a work yard to repair and upgrade Runway 1 and its runway lighting. * 2011: Start on work on building an airport terminus for the Manchester Metrolink within the station. * 17 May 2012: de Havilland Hornet Moth G-ADND landed again at Manchester Airport, 75 years after it first landed there, piloted by its current owner David Weston, from Bristol. Peter Menzies, son of its 17 May 1937 Fairey Aviation pilot Duncan Menzies, rode as passenger. * In June 2013 a new, 60 metres tall, air traffic control tower, costing ¬£20 million, was opened. * In 2019, PremiAir VIP terminal (adjacent to the Runway Visitor Park) began construction expected to open later in the year.

He was an equivocal supporter of the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Lowe was the second surviving son of Richard Lowe, a barrister of Shrewsbury and Calne and his second wife Mary Wootton, daughter of Charles Wotton, merchant, of Salisbury, Wiltshire and widow of John Vennard of Salisbury. His father was MP for Calne in 1614 and his uncle George Lowe, a London merchant, represented the town from 1625 to 1629. He came into his mother's property at Calne in 1640. History of Parliament Online - George Lowe In November 1640, Lowe was elected Member of Parliament for Calne in the Long Parliament. During the Civil War he supported the Royalist cause and sat at the parliament in Oxford. He later claimed that he acted under duress, and that he was not party to the vote declaring the Parliamentarian members at Westminster to be traitors. He was disabled from sitting at Westminster on 5 February 1644, but as a result of his voluntary and early surrender to Edward Massey, he was treated leniently by the committee for compounding and was fined at a tenth instead of a third of his estate. On release in 1646 he became a J.P. for Oxfordshire until 1653. He was commissioner for assessment for Oxfordshire from 1649 to 1652. After the Restoration, Lowe became J.P. for Wiltshire from July 1660 and commissioner for assessment for Wiltshire from August 1660, holding both roles until 1663.

Ashwini Dutt under the Vyjayanthi Movies banner and directed by Ram Gopal Varma. It stars Akkineni Nagarjuna, Sridevi in lead roles and music composed by Raj-Koti. Upon release, the film earned mixed reviews and became an average grosser. Plot Somewhere in time between Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga, sage Bhrigu (Gummadi) after performing Lok Kalyana Yaga, visits Vaikuntha and Lord Vishnu (Arun Govil) was reposing on Adisesha with Sri Mahalakshmi in service at his feet. Finding that Lord Vishnu did not notice him, the sage was infuriated and kicked the Lord on His chest, the place where Mahalakshmi (Yamuna) resides. Vishnu, in an attempt to pacify the sage, got hold of the legs of the sage and started to press them gently in a way that was comforting to the sage. During this act, he squeezed the extra eye that was present in the sole of Bhrigu's foot. The extra eye is believed to represent the sage's egotism. The sage then realized his grave mistake and apologized to Vishnu. Thereupon, the sage concluded that Lord Vishnu was supreme of the Trimurti and told the rishis the same. Sri Mahalakshmi was angered by the action of Her Lord in apologizing to Bhrigu, who committed an offense. Out of anger and anguish, She left Vaikuntha. After the departure of Mahalakshmi, a forlorn Lord Vishnu left Vaikunta, came down to Earth, and took abode in an ant-hill under a tamarind tree, beside a Pushkarini on the Venkata hill, meditating for the return of Lakshmi, without food or sleep. Disturbed with this phenomenon, angels and Devtas, appeal to Lord Vishnu to bring back goddess Lakshmi to help sustain the Universe, hence In Kali Yuga, Lord Vishnu takes the form of Venkateswara and incarnates on the Earth. In present-day Bangkok, a Tantric Stavroj (Dhir) believes that by donating a virgin woman's head to Lord Venkateswara's crown, he aims to attain supernatural powers through Telekinesis, which would bring down the universe to his feet. The Tantric wizard plans for execution of the theft of the Deity's Crown at the Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala, India for one million dollars in association with Bombay's notorious underworld mafia don Paresh, (Paresh Rawal), an experienced burglar known for grave robbery, and smuggling rare metals on the black market.

In India, on her vacation to Tirumala, she gets in touch with a Taxi driver Seenu(Akkineni Nagarjuna), and establishes a relationship with him. Seenu's father is the guard of Venkateshwara Temple. One fine day, Seenu helped Naveena from a group of Thiefs who are trying to cheat her. From that time, they both have good understanding and started liking each other. A small boy, whose parents left him at the streets of Venkateshwara Temple, was adopted by the main priest J.V. Somayajulu. The boy is a good friend to Seenu. Naveena took photos of that temple and met the Main priest and seenu's father. Upon their request, she visited their home. Seenu starts liking her but thinks of her status and didn't proposed her. He also saved her life from a Bear, which tried to kill her. Naveena returned to Bangkok, giving him her address. One day, Seenu's father is ill and cannot go to the Temple. Then, Paresh, along with this gang, robbed the crown and went to Bangkok unknowing that the small boy has seen them.

The third man to hold the post of conductor of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra, he is known from a number of recordings made by the old USSR state recording company Melodiya, but biographical information about him has been hard to find. Career A brief article in The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia says he was born in 1907 in the town of Yefremov or Efremov (Russian: –ï—Ñ—Ä–µÃÅ–º–æ–≤) in the Tula Oblast. At the age of 13, he was adopted by a regiment of the Red Army. He became a trumpeter in army orchestras. He attended the Moscow Conservatory where he studied conducting with the conductor L. M. Ginzburg. Ivanov graduated in 1937, and the following year won the third prize at the first edition of the All-Union Conductors Competition. Engagements with the Bolshoi Theatre and the All-Union Radio Symphony Orchestra followed in 1941. In 1945, Ivanov succeeded Nathan Rakhlin as Principal Conductor of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra. Under Ivanov's direction, the orchestra began an extensive program of touring. Initially this was to the republics of the Soviet Union, but in 1956 it performed in the Soviet allied states of Poland and Romania. As the Cold War thawed, Ivanov and the orchestra travelled outside the Communist bloc. In 1958 they made an appearance at an international exposition in Brussels where they performed for Queen Elizabeth of Belgium. In the same year they also visited China. In 1960, the orchestra visited the United States, then in 1961 appeared at the Vienna Festival. Konstantin Ivanov was succeeded as Principal Conductor of the USSR Symphony Orchestra in 1965 by Yevgeny Svetlanov. His reputation in later years, at least in the west, was somewhat eclipsed by the rise of a younger generation of Soviet conductors such as Svetlanov, Rozhdestvensky and Kondrashin, all of whom became much better known, and who travelled abroad more frequently. He died in 1984. Recordings Some of Ivanov's recordings became available in the west through the association of Britain's EMI Group with the Soviet state label Melodiya. These included his account of Glazunov‚Äôs 5th Symphony. The Dutch Melodia disc (562.265) of this performance was backed with four works by Anatoly Lyadov. EMI-Melodiya used these as fillers on LPs of Tchaikovsky‚Äôs First and Third Symphonies, conducted by Ivanov's successor Yevgeny Svetlanov. Ivanov also conducted Rimsky-Korsakov‚Äôs Antar Symphony with the USSR Radio and TV Symphony Orchestra on a 3-disc set of Rimsky's orchestral music. In 1973 Melodiya issued an LP of Rimsky-Korsakov's suites from Le Coq d'Or and Tsar Sultan. This also appeared on EMI-Melodiya. At various times, Ivanov recordings of Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony have been in circulation, as have symphonies by Eshpai and Arensky, along with Shostakovich‚Äôs cantata The Sun Shines Over the Motherland. The recordings considered here were heard in the following incarnations: ARENSKY: Suite No. 1 World Record Club (Australia) R 09475.

He is commonly known in his native language as B√†rd Loch F√¨ne (the \\"Poet of Loch Fyne\\"). Later he became known as \\"the Gaelic Bard of Canada\\".  Early life  Evan MacColl was born at Kenmore on the banks of Loch Fyne, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, on 21 September 1808 when the area was thoroughly Gaelic speaking. His father was Dugald MacColl who was possessed of \\"the richest store of Celtic song of any man living in his part of the country.\\"Alexander Mackenzie, 'Evan MacColl ‚Äì the Bard of Loch Fyne', in The Celtic Magazine, Inverness: A & W Mackenzie, 1881, Volume VI, p.54. This is a three part biography: (1) No. LXII, December 1880, pp,. 54‚Äì58; (2) No. LXIII, January 1881, pp. 95‚Äì103; (3) No. LXIV, February 1881, pp. 139‚Äì145 (an extract from MacColl's diary for 1838‚Äì39 of a tour of the Highlands). His mother, Mary Cameron, \\"was noted for her storehouse of traditional tales, legendary and fairy tales.\\" She was also said to be something of an 'improvisatrice' or maker-up of tales. Though MacColl was fully employed farming and fishing, and later with road repairs, he nevertheless received a fair education. His father was fond of literature and procured books for his children when he could. The local village school offered a very limited education in English, and his father employed a tutor who taught his son English and instilled in him a love of Burns and of English literature in general. His poetic efforts began in boyhood, founded on a rich vein of the native Gaelic literary tradition surrounding him in youth and inherited from his family, although also inflected by the growing influence of Lowland Scots and anglophone literature.  Later life  MacColl's family emigrated to Canada in 1831, but he could not make up his mind to leave Scotland. He continued his employment in road repairs while composing many of his best-regarded Gaelic lyrics. He published his first book of poems at his own expense in Glasgow in 1836. This was The Mountain Minstrel; or, Cl√†rsach nam Beann, and it sold enough to give the author a small profit. In 1837, he began contributing to the Gaelic Magazine then published in Glasgow. From October 1838 to January 1839, MacColl made a tour of northeast Scotland which was recorded in a diary published by Alexander Mackenzie in his biography of MacColl. Later in 1839 he became a clerk with the Customs House in Liverpool. He remained in Liverpool until 1850, when, because of declining health, he obtained six months' leave of absence and visited friends and relatives in Canada. While staying on his brother's farm on the Trent River, he was introduced to the Hon. Malcolm Cameron, then a Minister of the Crown and was offered a position in the Canadian Customs at Kingston, Ontario, which he accepted. MacColl remained in this post for thirty years and was superannuated about the year 1880.Evan MacColl ‚Äì Poemhunter.com Retrieved 5 November 2011 His first wife was Frances Lewthwaite whom he married in Toxteth, Liverpool on 6 May 1847.Marriage information available at He later married Isabella MacArthur in Kingston. He had nine children from one or both marriages. He died on 24 July 1898 in Toronto and was buried in Kingston.  Poetic achievements  Dr. Norman McLeod, editor of Good Words, wrote as follows: MacColl wrote numerous poems while in Canada, including one in Gaelic in praise of a Scottish organization in Toronto in 1858. MacColl was literate in Gaelic and was a well respected authority on the literature of the Highlands, sought out in Canada by those who took an interest in the subject. One of MacColl‚Äôs English poems is \\"Robin\\", written for the occasion of the Burns Centennial celebration in Kingston. The poem's easy and melodious expression is in excellent imitation of Burns' own style. He had been for many years the bard of the St. Andrew's Society of Kingston, and his anniversary poems are greatly appreciated by all Scotsmen. His poetic gifts were inherited by his daughter, Miss Mary J. MacColl,See her work listed here: http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n82-158355 who published a meritorious little volume of poems entitled \\"Bide a wee,\\" highly commended for their sweetness and delicacy.

It has many applications in the water, sewage and food industries.http://www.bristol.ac.uk/eng-systems- centre/idc/projects/danmcbryde.html The University of Bristol has held many laboratory trials to investigate various key factors and refine the process. Ice pigging was invented and patented by Professor Joe Quarini of the University of Bristol.  Effectiveness  The ice pigging method occupies a ‚Äòmiddle ground‚Äô between two of the traditional methods of cleaning pipes;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeNgFv5nIi4, 18/02/2013 that of ‚Äòflushing‚Äô, which involves pumping high velocity water through pipes in order to carry away residue, and pigging, forcing a solid object through the pipe to push away any loose material. Ice pigging utilises the main principles behind these two methods.http://www.wioa.org.au/conference_papers/2011_qld/documents/Graeme_Berriman.pdf An ice-water slurry, typically between 50 and 90% ice fraction is introduced to and removed from pipes with little complication, provided the presence of suitable hydrants and valves. The high ice fraction lends several attributes which are particularly appealing for application in pigging; It is able to hold itself together under continuous shear. If the ice becomes stuck then given enough time it will just melt and be carried away. It is fairly inexpensive to make. It leaves the pipe walls themselves undamaged, and only removes waste residue. Because ice pigging is a relatively quick process (when compared to alternative methods), it can be used for a number of applications including: underground pipes for fresh water and sewage, food manufacturing pipe work and many others.http://www.undergroundconstructionmagazine.com/ice- pigging-new-water-sewer-pigging-method-offers-unique-benefits, January 2013  Environmental impacts  Ice pigging uses less water and requires less cleanup than traditional flushing or underground pipe pigging techniques.http://info.ncsafewater.org/Shared%20Documents/Web%20Site%20Documents/Spring%20Conference/SC13_Abstracts/Water/TuesWater6-IcePigging- Abstract_RMoore-IcePigging.pdf However, the process requires more energy since the ice slurries must be chilled and constantly agitated up until the point they are inserted into the pipes.  Research and development  The University of Bristol have produced a paper entitled \\"Investigation and development of an innovative pigging technique for the water supply industry.\\" in which they have detailed the research that they have carried out. It looks particularly at how the properties of the ice pig behave with different ice fractions and varied levels of particulate loading as well as looking into the effects of shear strength, viscosity and heat transfer characteristics.  Process  * The ice pig is inserted into the pipe in a semi liquid form and can adapt to the topography of the pipes as well as large changes in diameter. * Ice pigging doesn't require expensive excavation or preliminary treatment because it can be inserted into a pipe through existing access points whatever their diameter and then expand to the size required. Likewise the ice will exit the pipe with ease through any fire hydrant. * Ice pigging uses less water than traditional pipe cleaning methods. The Pig is pushed through the pipe using just one pipe volume of water and then the pipe is flushed for a short period returning the water quality to its usual limits typically using 1/4 to 1/2 of the pipe volume,http://www.aqualogyuk.com/Water-Networks/Ice- Pigging/Advantages-of-Ice-Pigging , 10/10/2011 Total water usage is therefore typically 1.5 times the volume of the pipe to be cleaned. * The ice pigging process can be used in pipes of any material and will not damage the internal structure of the pipe. * The ice pigging process takes less time than traditional pigging methods for underground pipes and can be operated by fewer people reducing labour costs.http://www.bris.ac.uk/research/impact- stories/2012/ice-pigging.html, 12/03/2012 * Ice pigging is a low risk technique and minimal enabling works are required to insert the ice and remove it.http://www.theengineer.co.uk/process-and-production-breaking-the-ice-for- cleaner-pipes/1000291.article * Ice pigging in manufacturing can reduce effluent costs and provide product recovery benefits, when compared to water flushing.

It is a comprehensive university with an excellence in teacher training and professional development. Having merged with Hangzhou Education College and Hangzhou Medical Junior College, HNU comprises nine campuses with a combined area of 513,590 m¬≤. HNU has nearly 12,000 full-time students, 9,000 of whom are undergraduates. Of over 1,000 teachers, over 100 have a doctorate degree or are Ph.D. candidates, and 283 have a master's degree. There are nearly 490 professors (researchers) and associate professors (associate researchers). History In 1905, the governor of Zhejiang Province founded a teaching school, aimed at training teachers for high schools and primary schools for the province. In 1908, the school was named Zhejiang Official Secondary Normal School (ÊµôÊ±üÂÆòÁ´ã‰∏§Á∫ßÂ∏àËåÉÂ≠¶Â†Ç) and was in the original address of Zhejiang Gongyuan (ÊµôÊ±üË¥°Èô¢). Shen Junru was appointed as supervisor in 1909. In 1912, under the guidance of the Education Department of the Republic of China, the school became one of the six well-known higher teacher education schools at that time. It issued its own publications, such as Baiyang (ÁôΩÈò≥) and Zhejiang Trendy (ÊµôÊ±üÊñ∞ÊΩÆ). It set up clubs, such as Music Rock Club (‰πêÁü≥Á§æ), Lakeside Poetry Club (ÊπñÁïîËØóÁ§æ), and Mingyuan Club (ÊòéËøúÂ≠¶Á§æ). Educationist Jing Hengyi (Áªè‰∫®È¢ê) was the principal; famous masters such as Li Shutongand Lu Xun taught there; Feng Zikai, Qian Xuesen, and Pan Tianshou studied at the school. When the Japanese invaded Hangzhou during World War II, the school was relocated in to places such as Jiande and Lishui; it was moved back to Hangzhou after the war. The school has been under direct jurisdiction of the Hangzhou Municipal Government since 1954. In 1978, the State Council approved to found Hangzhou Normal College (Êù≠Â∑ûÂ∏àËåÉÂ≠¶Èô¢), which was approved by Ministry of Education (China) to change its name to Hangzhou Normal University in March 2007. In 2010, a proposal was jointly submitted by Sun Zhonghuan, Zhao Guangyu, Yu Jialing, Zhu Zude and Chen Xiaoping, three municipal officials of Hangzhou. They suggested changing Hangzhou Normal University to be Hangzhou University, because this university had reached the level of old University of Hangzhou. However, many provincial and municipal officials and dignitaries obviously rejected it. This was a widespread but unsuccessful proposal in the end. General information As the key municipal university, Hangzhou Normal University has five campuses ‚Äî Xiasha Campus (‰∏ãÊ≤ôÊ†°Âå∫), Wenyilu Campus (Êñá‰∏ÄÊ†°Âå∫), Yuhuangshan Campus (ÁéâÁöáÂ±±Ê†°Âå∫), Gudangwan Campus (Âè§Ëç°ÊπæÊ†°Âå∫), and Xianghu Campus (ÊπòÊπñÊ†°Âå∫) ‚Äî covering a total area of around 1400 mu (approx. 93.38 hectares). Having acquired a land of about 558 mu (approx 37.22 hectares), the university is building another called Cangqian Campus. Consisting of 18 schools providing 49 undergraduate majors and 39 postgraduate disciplines, the university has three majors with features at the state level; 11 key majors and six key disciplines at the provincial level; one course of fine quality at the state level; and 18 courses of fine quality at the provincial level. The school accommodates 18,597 undergraduates and 1,341 postgraduates and employs over 2,100 staff and faculty members. Among 1,388 full-time teaching faculty, 700 are either professors or associate professors. In addition, four honorable co-engaged academicians are engaged to make valuable contributions to the cause of education. Hangzhou Normal University is undergoing several major projects. In 2009, joint venture was made between Hangzhou Normal University and Alibaba group to form Alibaba Business School. Jack Ma, who is the founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, is the chairman of Alibaba Business School. Alibaba Business School is determined to change the traditional business education, to establish an entrepreneurial college for internet entrepreneurs. Alibaba Business School offers full-time bachelor's and master's degree programs in China, which include E-commerce, International Business, Marketing (Digital Marketing) and Logistics.

Life He was born at Rouen, son of the advocate Henri Basnage de Franquesnay and brother of Jacques Basnage. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, he made some attempts to stay in France, but left for Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 1687. He died in The Hague. Works He wrote Tol√©rance des religions, published by Henri de Gr√¶ff at Rotterdam in 1684; it was a plea to French Catholics for religious tolerance. His Histoire des Ouvrages des Savans was a periodical appearing from 1687 to 1709; it was a sequel to the Nouvelles de la R√©publique des Lettres of Pierre Bayle, who had sheltered him and his brother Jacques. The change of title was in fact cosmetic, to avoid trouble with the publisher of the Nouvelles. Basnage himself did almost all the editorial, and the reviews of John Locke's works, in particular, did much to spread his ideas. He worked over the Dictionnaire universel of Antoine Fureti√®re, producing an expanded edition; it went through numerous editions, before being taken up by Jean Brutel de la Rivi√®re (1727, The Hague). Basnage's version was considered \\"Protestant\\"; the Jesuits of the M√©moires de Tr√©voux found heresy in articles where they considered he had introduced a Protestant view. Basnage defended himself in the Journal des s√ßavans, but the Jesuits went ahead with an expurgated edition, a model for the Dictionnaire de Tr√©voux. Basnage's lexicographical approach was in fact more descriptive than normative. Under the pseudonym Le F√®vre, Basnage also wrote the Lettre sur les differends de M. Jurieu & de M. Bayle. His publications were: * Tol√©rance des religions; edited by Elisabeth Labrousse, New York; London, Johnson Reprint Corp., 1970 * Histoire des Ouvrages des Savans. Volumes 1-24.

Three years later he was appointed Sales Director of Agusta's Aircraft Division with responsibility for worldwide market development, strategy and negotiation. In June 1989 he was elected President and Chief Executive Officer of Agusta Aerospace Corporation Giuseppe Orsi Chief Executive Officer and President, Finmeccanica SpA - Bloomberg Businessweek (AgustaWestland's North American production plant in Philadelphia) and in January 1994 he joined the reorganised Agusta International Sales Department as Senior Vice President, Government Sales and Programs. In 1997, as Deputy General Manager of Agusta, he managed the company's presence in the international market and negotiated a joint venture with Bell Helicopters involving Tiltrotor and AB139 helicopters, saying that \\"Consolidating ownership of the AB139 will provide a single face to the customer, leading to increased sales and greater customer satisfaction related to follow-on support services.\\" Bell Helicopter Sells Interest in AB139 Joint Venture - Aero news Network In 2001, as Managing Director of marketing and sales, he was part of the Agusta and Westland (AgustaWestland) merger and he subsequently joined the 'Management Committee'. A year later he was appointed Managing Director of Agusta and COO of AgustaWestland's Italian operations. In 2001, as Managing Director of marketing and sales, he was part of the merger of Agusta and Westland into AgustaWestland and subsequently joined the firm's Management Committee. A year later he was appointed Managing Director of Agusta SpA and COO of AgustaWestland's Italian operations. In 2004, he was appointed CEO of AgustaWestland, a post he held until 2011. During this period, AgustaWestland experienced significant growth in terms of sales, profit, EBIT, and cash flow. In 2011 he was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Finmeccanica SpA. He was made CEO and Chairman at a time when Finmeccanica had \\"endured years of scandal related to allegations of kickbacks, management impropriety and other problems connected to Orsi‚Äôs predecessor as CEO, Pierfrancesco Guarguaglini, and the political leadership of Italy‚Äôs former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.\\" Although these scandals pre-dated Orsi, he had \\"not yet escaped taint,\\" according to analysts. When Orsi took control of the firm, he sought to restructure it by selling off its \\"noncore divisions, including energy-engineering-services provider Ansaldo Energia, transportation-technology company Ansaldo STS and train and tram maker AnsaldoBreda.\\" Orsi's restructuring plan for Finmeccanica reportedly \\"harmed his support within the firm. In October 2011, Orsi forced the resignation of Lorenzo Borgogni, Finmeccanica's longtime head of external relations, after the latter admitted to interrogators that he had taken millions of euros in bribes from companies that had received Finmeccanica contracts. Investigation of Indian helicopter sale Prosecutors in Naples began investigating Orsi in the spring of 2011, shortly after he was promoted from CEO of AgustaWestland to CEO of Finmeccanica. Prosecutors were looking into whether AgustaWestland paid bribes to secure the ‚Ç¨560 million sale of 12 helicopters to the Indian government and, if so, what role Orsi had in this scheme. The probe was triggered by accusations made by Borgogni, who supplied prosecutors with details of kickbacks supposedly paid by AgustaWestland to guarantee purchase of the helicopters. The payments were allegedly made by two Swiss businessmen Guido Ralph Haschke and Christian Michael, who acted as middlemen in a scheme also purportedly involving Orsi, Haschke's business partner Carlo Gerosa, AgustaWestland CEO Bruno Spagnolini. Borgogni charged that at least 10 million of a 51 million euro slush fund had been \\"funnelled back to Italy and paid to the Lega Nord party in return for its support to Orsi's bid to become president of Finmeccanica.\\" An April 2012 report by the Financial Times stated that the Naples probe was focusing on Orsi and that Finmeccanica considered Borgogni's charges to be trumped-up and motivated by a desire to bring down Orsi to avenge his dismissal from the firm. Another April 2012 report indicated that Naples prosecutors were gathering evidence in Switzerland about Finmeccanina's bank accounts purporedly opened in that country for the purpose of channeling kickback funds. On 15 October 2012, Orsi‚Äôs lawyer said at a news conference that Orsi would resign if the Italian government wished him to do so, but that \\"his personal intention is to stay on, defend himself and demonstrate that accusations against him are groundless.\\" In a front-page editorial about Orsi and Finmeccanica on 24 October, Corriere della Sera commented: \\"If the government does not want to, or does not know how to, give guidelines to management, then it should take the responsibility to sell it.\\" On 27 October, a report stated that Orsi and Finmecannica were \\"under increasing public pressure as corruption probes into the firms' foreign sales continue to expand,\\" with investigators now looking into possible irregularities in connection with contracts in Brazil and Panama, in addition to India. An Italian analyst said that the investigations were \\"negative for Finmeccanica‚Äôs reputation, and it is not clear if Orsi will survive.\\" According to a February 2013, report, Finmeccanica's credit ratings had recently dropped, with Standard & Poor lowering it to BB+/B, from BBB-/A-3, which took its debt \\"below the investment grade level.\\" It was noted that a year earlier, shortly after his appointment as CEO, Orsi had \\"presented Finmeccanica‚Äôs 2011 results and solemnly promised never again to have to discuss such dreadful numbers. As he details the 2012 financials on 12 March he can be sure the number crunchers will be pressing him for hard timing details of Finmeccanica‚Äôs disposal plans, not to mention a good explanation for why so little headway was made during 2012.\\" Arrest On 12 February 2013, Italian police arrested Orsi, and Public Prosecutor Eugenio Fusco ordered him held in jail in Busto Arsizio, near Milan. Orsi's lawyer, Ennio Amodio, said in an interview that the arrests of Orsi and of Bruno Spagnoligni, his successor as head of AgustaWestland, \\"decapitate the heads of two companies that are important for the Italian economy.\\" In a written statement, Finmeccanica expressed support for Orsi. A report stated that Orsi's arrest, coming shortly before a national election, was \\"particularly politically sensitive because the Italian state owns slightly more than 30% of the defense company, making it the single largest shareholder.\\" Orsi said he would step down from his position if asked to by the government. A few hours after Orsi's arrest, Shashikant Sharma, Defense Secretary of India, said his government had ordered an investigation of helicopter deal. On 13 February, Spagnolini was also placed under arrest and the Finmeccanica board appointed group COO and CFO Alessandro Pansa to serve in Orsi's place. Two days later, the firm announced that Orsi had officially resigned as chairman and as a board member. Orsi said he had resigned in order to \\"help calm the atmosphere.\\" The Wall Street Journal noted that Orsi's arrest came at a time when prosecutors in various Italian cities were \\"investigating the company on suspicion that it engaged in corrupt activities to win various types of contracts in Latin America, Asia and at home,\\" probes that had led to other arrests. Massimo Vecchio, an aerospace analyst for Mediobanca, said that Orsi's arrest risked damaging the international reputation and competitiveness of Finmeccanica. Orsi was held for some 80 days in pre-trial detention. On 4 May 2013, he was freed from jail pending trial. Prosecutors alleged that the kickbacks allegedly paid with Orsi's knowledge were standard practice at Finmeccanica. Trial Orsi and Spagnolini went on trial in Milan on 5 June 2013, on charges of fraud and corruption. According to the Wall Street Journal, the case had \\"convulsed\\" Finmeccanica because it \\"risked worsening its relationship\\" with a major client, the Indian government. In January 2014, the Indian government canceled its helicopter deal with AgustaWestland. In July 2014, prosecutors asked that Orsi be sentenced to six years in prison for paying bribes. According to a September 2014 report in The Hindu, an investigation by Indian authorities had determined that around ‚Ç¨60 million had been paid by AgustaWestland to clinch the Indian sale, with Christian Michel receiving ‚Ç¨30 million, Orsi ‚Ç¨12 million, and the rest going to Haschke and Gerosa to pass on to persons in India. Indian investigators had also reportedly determined that Orsi and Spagnolini later \\"entered into engineering contracts with two companies IDS Infotech and IDS Tunisia as a 'subterfuge' to pay kickbacks to middlemen and public servants in India.\\" On 30 September, in his final summation, Orsi's defense lawyer Ennio Amodio said that Orsi was innocent of all charges. Amodio said, \\"Orsi believed his role was to clean up old corruption and to do this he got rid of 40 people,\\" including Borgogni, and insisted that Borgogni had only leveled accusations against Orsi \\"because he had been ousted by Orsi.\\" On 9 October 2014, Orsi and Spagnolini were both sentenced to two years in prison for false bookkeeping and acquitted of international corruption in the helicopter case. Awards In 2010 Orsi was appointed as a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire(CBE) Giuseppe Orsi, CEO of AgustaWestland, receives the Honour of Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire - British Embassy Rome and in the same year he was also named a 'Freeman of the City of London' by the Mayor of London. He is also a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS).

Close by is the Gro√üer B√§renstein which, together with the Kleiner B√§renstein, forms the massif of the B√§rensteine.  Location and area  The Kleiner B√§renstein is located within a loop of the River Elbe at Rathen. The B√§rensteine peaks form part of the parish boundary of Wei√üig. At the foot of the B√§renstein are the woodlands of the farms of Fleck from Wei√üig. Also nearby are the villages of Th√ºrmsdorf and Naundorf. On the Kleiner B√§renstein there are several climbing rocks, the most important being the Th√ºrmsdorfer Stein.  History  The Kleiner B√§renstein was first recorded in 1548 as \\"im Behrenstein\\". Earlier descriptions also talked of the \\"Th√ºrmsdorfer B√§renstein\\". In the 19th century the district forester (Revierf√∂rster), Wilhelm Mahn, made the B√§renstein accessible to hikers. From 1851 until 1943 there was a small day-trippers pub on the Kleiner B√§renstein.Peter R√∂lke: Stiegen-Wanderf√ºhrer S√§chsische Schweiz, Berg- & Naturverlag R√∂lke, 2012, , pp.54-60 As a result of the Second World War it was not possible to renovate and maintain it, so the restaurant fell into decay. Its foundations are still visible today. In 2004 the woods around the B√§rensteine were bought by private individuals.  Diebskeller  At the southwestern foot of the Kleiner B√§renstein there is a small collapse cave, caused by a rockfall and erosion, that is known locally as the Thieves' Cellar (Diebskeller). Wilhelm Leberecht G√∂tzinger, who grew up in nearby Struppen, was apparently inspired to research the nature of Saxon Switzerland when walking to the Kleiner B√§renstein as a child. G√∂tzinger later published the first comprehensive descriptions of Saxon Switzerland. In 1886 the Saxon Switzerland Alpine Club erected a memorial tablet in the Diebskeller in honour of G√∂tzinger.

Vikram Varma achieved his prominence in representing highly publicized cases by the news media, mostly involving foreigners, such as the sensational Scarlett Keeling case which captured the imagination of the Indian public. The Keeling case started when some local authorities tried to cover up the death of a 15-year-old British girl as a drowning accident. The case was debated in the Local Parliament and even mentioned in the national Parliament in Delhi. It was widely covered by media including BBC, The Guardian, The Times, CNN-IBN, Times of India and other national media. It has been transformed into a documentary by Channel 4 and a Bollywood movie.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48999773 Advocate Varma played a pivotal role in the Scarlett Keeling case with the Guardian newspaper describing him as a \\"dogged local lawyer who helped dismantle the official account. Amid allegations of cover-up and corruption, Scarlett's Mother and Vikram Varma managed to get the case reopened\\". The Russian Consulate has appointed Vikram Varma as their advocate in Goa. For the last six years, as Advocate for Russia in Goa he looks after all the legal requirements of the 100 thousand Russian Tourists who visit Goa every year. Some of the highly publicized cases in Goa are: * Ingo Grill (deported) & his Saturday Night Market vs. Government * Scarlett Keeling case * Tourism Minister Micky Pacheco's involvement in the death of his mistress Nadia Torado * Sexual assault on Russian minor. In July 2009, in an attempt to embarrass Scarlett Keeling's mother, Fiona MacKeown, and her legal Team, email correspondence of Vikram Varma and his clients were leaked to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks published an independent report headlined: 'In Goa we trust: the Rape and Murder of British School Girl Scarlett Keeling'. A subsequent report was titled 'The murder- coverup of British School Girl Scarlett Keeling'. In its report Wikileaks wrote 'These autopsies showed that Scarlett had sandy water in her lungs and around 50 bruises and abrasions, suggesting that she had drowned in shallow water after a struggle. She had also ingested a cocktail of drugs including LSD and Cocaine. The Central Bureau of Investigation took over the case. Two men were detained and a police officer suspended. The case is ongoing. The emails also show correspondence with various journalists from the UK, India and elsewhere who can be contacted for independent verification. Included in these is a 15,000 pound contract between the British TV company Channel 4 and Fiona MacKeown for a series of exclusive interviews. Sky TV and others also paid for exclusives'. This independent Wikileaks report headline, reinforcing what MacKeown and Varma had been asserting from Day 1, further galvanised media coverage of the case. On 16 December 2009, women Parliamentarians cutting across party lines, joined hands to defend one of Vikram Varma's clients in the national Parliament in Delhi, India. According to a Times of India report CPM's Brinda Karat, Najma Heptullah, Maya Singh and Jaya Bachchan insisted they would not allow any Member of the Parliament to use the House to abuse women. BJP Spokesperson Ravishankar Prasad also objected to the speech attacking Mr. Varma's client. Congress spokesperson Renuka Chowdhury supported the BJP Spokesperson's views on this subject. Fiona MacKeown claimed there was a conspiracy to cover-up the rape and murder of her daughter. She accused Roy Naik the son of Indian Minister Ravi Naik to be involved in the affair. Vikram Varma is currently residing and holds his office in Porvorim. BBC and Forbes have interviewed Vikram because of his expertise on the Complex Land Laws in Goa. CNN-IBN's Editor in Chief, in his news program, has done a joint interview with the then Goa Chief Minister Mr. Kamat and Mr. Varma on the ground realities for tourists in Goa. Mid-Day in an article on millionaire NRIs using Rehab facilities in Mumbai sought Vikram Varma's views on the topic. On 4 December 2011, the Russian Government used one of Vikram Varma's premises as a polling booth for its national elections. As this was the first time that voting facilities were provided to Russians in India outside of its Embassy, it was widely reported by the Indian media such as Times of India and DNA.

History Emblem of Tunisia before 1956 related to the Husainid dynasty. Muhammad VIII al-Amin and French PM Mendes France in 1954. An independence movement lasting many decades eventually prevailed, leading to the end of the French protectorate (commenced in 1881). In 1954 the Tunisian struggle and consequent civil disturbances resulted in the start of negotiations for autonomy between France and the Neo Destour political party (essentially under Habib Bourguiba) supported by the Tunisian labor unions and by the Arab League. The agreed Convention of April, 1955, stated that France would retain control of the army and foreign affairs while granting autonomy, which was to begin the following year. Bourguiba was released from prison by the French to a tumultuous welcome. This compromise, however, split the Neo Destour; eventually it led to suppression of its left wing, and expulsion of its radical, pan-Arab leader Salah ben Youssef, who later fled to Egypt. This resolution of intra-party strife signalled that Neo Destour would pursue a moderate path. The French then terminated their protectorate over Morocco, in order to concentrate their forces in Algeria. In reaction, and following the strong public opinion voiced by Tunisians, Bourguiba pressed for independence. The French, overcoming the heated objections of the French settlers, eventually acceded and protocols were drafted. On 20 March 1956, Tunisia achieved its full sovereignty. In July Tunisia's application for membership in the United Nations was accepted. Independence Ben Ammar and Bourguiba. The French conceived an independent Tunisia as a constitutional monarchy ruled by the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad VIII al-Amin. The Bey was an institution that dated back to the early Ottoman era. The prior Bey Muhammad VII al-Munsif had been a popular nationalist, but Amin Bey was both considered by some to be compromised by the French, by others to be a youssefist. Already scheduled elections were held on 25 March 1956; due to secret arrangements negotiated by Bourguiba with the Bey the voters choose only party lists, not candidates. This arrangement made it easier for the Neo Destour party to keep out any youssefist or other dissidents, and to maintain party discipline.Cf., Geyer, Tunisia (London: Stacy 2003) at 41. Geyer notes the \\"pyramidal structure\\" of the Neo Destour, nonetheless she praises Bourguiba's \\"flexibility and moderation\\". The elections were then swept by the Neo Destour party, whose leader Habib Bourguiba became prime minister. Subdivisions Royal Palace of Carthage. The king receiving Roger Seydoux, first ambassador of France. The governorate system was set up by the decree of June 21, 1956 by the Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia Habib Bourguiba. The latter organized the regional administration, henceforth carried out by governors, general secretaries and delegates. The framework law, adopted accordingly, removes the charges for: * 38 ca√Øds in office including Sheikh El Medina of Tunis; * 49 kahias in office and five in excess; * 77 active khalifas and 18 in excess. The body of governors which takes over from the Caidal authorities is chosen from among the Neo-Destour executives. The Makhzen, made up of families who controlled the regional administration, is dismantled. Justifying the decision, Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba declared, before the National Council of Neo-Destour, on June 23, 1956: \\"We felt it necessary to purify these frameworks to ensure cooperation based on reciprocal respect between the State personified in its representatives and the people who must respect in them, no longer the agents of colonization, but the servants of the public interest. For the vast majority of executives affected by the cleansing, the blow was hard. Some suffer terribly from it. But we were in an inescapable necessity.\\" Fourteen governorates emerged with independence which are: * B√©ja Governorate * Bizerte Governorate * Gab√®s Governorate * Gafsa Governorate * Jendouba Governorate * Kairouan Governorate * Kasserine Governorate * Le Kef Governorate * M√©denine Governorate * Nabeul Governorate * Sfax Governorate * Sousse Governorate * Tozeur Governorate * Tunis Governorate Reforms of the kingdom Photo of the government with King Mohammed VIII al-Amin. Richard Nixon, his wife and Faisal of Saudi Arabia hosted by the king and Bourguiba in March 1957 during the celebration of the 1st anniversary of independence. Prime Minister Bourguiba, since the first months of independence, carried out radical reforms in Tunisian society. On 13 August 1956, he issued the Code of Personal Status in Tunisia that banned polygamy and mandated the courts to consider divorce requests while endowments were dissolved and the judiciary unified. On the administrative level, in June 1956, the \\"al-Kiyadat\\" (Ca√Øds) was abolished and replaced by 14 governorates consisting of delegations. In the same month, the National Army was dispatched and, before that, in April 1956, security came under Tunisian leadership. The government also made relentless efforts to rest the state structures. He also issued an order on 31 May 1956, which stipulated the suspension of the financial privileges that were spent on members of the royal family. On 21 June of the same year, an order was issued to alter the emblem of the Kingdom of Tunisia, according to which all references to the Husainid dynasty were deleted. On 3 August 1956, another order was issued transferring the executive powers from the king to his prime minister. The Royal Guard was also replaced by a unit of the newly formed Tunisian army. So confirmation of this, he worked to gradually reduce the influence of the king, who in the end had nothing left but to sit on the throne and exercise ceremonial functions and a small part of the legislative authority, such as putting his stamp on and signing the orders, decisions and decrees presented to him by his prime minister every Thursday, which led to the establishment of a parliamentary monarchy similar to the British monarchy. Declaration of the republic King Muhammad VIII and PM Bourguiba at the Royal Palace of Carthage. Since his return from France and the conclusion of the internal independence agreements in 1955, Habib Bourguiba sought to reassure members of the royal family and ambassadors of great powers accredited to Tunisia that a constitutional monarchy would be adopted. On the other hand, he was alluding to these with some counter-references, similar to what was stated in his inaugural speech at the Constituent Assembly on 8 April 1956, in which he praised Muhammad VII, acknowledging that he was a strong Republican. On 15 July 1957, security forces imposed a guard on the royal palace, preventing entry and exit from it. The police also imposed surveillance on all roads leading to the royal palace. On 18 July, Bourguiba launched an attack on the royal family, focusing on their disdain for the law. The next day, the police arrested the youngest son of the king, Prince Slah Eddine (32 years old), and he was imprisoned in the civilian prison of Tunis. Then the Prime Minister Bourguiba and the Minister of Foreign Affairs met on 23 July with the Tunisian ambassadors in Paris, Washington, Cairo, Rome, London, Madrid and Rabat, asking about the expected reactions from these countries if the king will be deposed. It appears that these diplomats advised Bourguiba to seek moderation. The Tunisian ambassador to Rabat informed the attendees that such an act would be viewed with suspicion in Morocco and might be met with disapproval due to the friendship between the Tunisian and Moroccan royal families. Proclamation of the republic in the constituent assembly. On the evening of 23 July, the Political office of the Neo Destour Party decided to call the Constituent Assembly to convene on 25 July to consider the form of the state and entrusted it, implicitly, with the task of declaring the republic. On the day of the session, Tunisian and foreign media, including radio and written press, were invited to attend the events, in addition to an invitation to the diplomatic corps. At half past nine in the morning, the Constituent Assembly opened its works. From the start, the speaker defined the topic of the session by saying that the agenda in it is to consider the form of the state. After calling the deputies, the interventions focused on the need to define the form of the state, highlight the faults of the monarchy, and call for the republic as a new system for the state. At six o'clock in the evening the deputies voted unanimously to establish the republic. So, the monarchy was abolished by the decision of the elected Constituent Assembly, the royal office terminated, and Tunisia proclaimed a Republic. The assembly then made Bourguiba the first president of the republic.Kenneth J.

In the name of God the Merciful We, the representatives of the Tunisian nation, members of the National Constituent Assembly, by virtue of the full influence we have derived from the people, in support of the pillars of the independence of the state and the sovereignty of the people, and on the path of the democratic system, which is the assembly‚Äôs point of drawing the constitution, we take the following decision in force immediately: First: We completely abolish the monarchy. Second: We declare that Tunisia is a republic Third: We assign the Prime Minister, Mr. Habib Bourguiba, with the duties of the presidency of the republic in its present state, pending the entry into force of the constitution, and we call it the title of President of the Republic of Tunisia. Fourth: We instruct the government to implement this decision and to take the necessary measures to maintain the republican system. We also instruct the Speaker of the Assembly, the Secretary General of the Assembly‚Äôs office and the government to report this decision to the private and public. We issued it in the Palace of Bardo on Thursday at six in the evening on the 26th of Dhu al-Hijjah 1376 and on the 25th of July 1957 Signature: Jallouli Fares Aftermath Tunisian newspaper announced the next day the establishment of the republic (in Arabic). Bourguiba was preoccupied with the reservations of Libya, Morocco and Saudi Arabia, as well as some western circles, about declaring the republic in Tunisia. In confirmation of this, the ambassador of the Kingdom of Libya left the headquarters of the Constituent Assembly in protest against the declaration of the republic by virtue of the treaty that had bound the two countries during the state visit of the Libyan Prime Minister, Mustafa Ben Halim to Tunisia in the beginning of 1957, and the signing of Bourguiba and Mustafa bin Halim of the Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness between Tunisia and Libya in 6 January 1957. On 21 February of the same year, King Saud bin Abdulaziz visited Tunisia and met the King. This prompted Bourguiba to assign the foreign minister to contact the ambassadors of the two countries in Tunisia and to reassure them of the fate of their relations with them. On the same day of the proclamation of the Republic, a delegation of several personalities was assigned to inform the ousted king of the requirements of the Constituent Assembly‚Äôs decision and to invite him to comply with it. The delegation included Ali Belhouane, (General Secretary of the National Constituent Assembly), Ta√Øeb Mhiri (Minister of Interior), Ahmed Mestiri (Minister of Justice), Driss Guiga (Director of National Security), Abdelmajid Chaker (member of the political bureau of the party), Ahmed Zaouche (Mayor of Tunis), Tijani Ktari (commander of the National Guard). > 'We went into the throne room right away, and without being announced, as we > were already expected.

In October 1958, the Bey and his wife were transferred to a house in the suburb of Soukra, and he was only released in 1960, to move to live freely in an apartment in Lafayette, with his son, prince Salah Eddine, until his death on 30 September 1962.

The Omsk State Regional Research Library, named after Alexander Pushkin, is the oldest public library in Omsk and is the main research library in the region. History In 1899 the Omsk Municipal Duma made a decision to open a municipal public library in honor of Pushkin‚Äôs centenary. The library was opened in January 1907. It was located in the extension to the Municipal Duma that was constructed against the special project of architect G.S. Bartkovsky. Two adjoining rooms were set aside for the reading hall and the premises where the books could be rented. The library numbered 4 160 books and magazines, 370 readers in the first year of serving the Omsk residents. In 1920 they opened a room for studies and a museum with following departments: bibliography of Russian, foreign literature and modern editions, children‚Äôs department with a club and a bindery. During the time of nationalization within 2‚Äì3 years the library archive fund expanded to 300 thousand items, which made the Omsk library to be one of the biggest book depositories in Siberia. From 1922 to 1924 the library was located in the building of central post office (former store of tradeswoman Shanina, currently it‚Äôs a trade house ‚ÄúLyubinsky‚Äù). However, in 1924 the library moved to its original place ‚Äì at that time it occupied almost the whole building. In 1930s Omsk became a regional centre and the library achieved the status of being regional. Since 1940 the library started to get compulsory copies of all books published in the country. During the Great Patriotic War all the activity of the Pushkin library was subordinated to the war time needs. The employees had to answer the inquiries of specialists from industrial enterprises, theatres and organizations that were evacuated to Omsk from the European part of the country, they also patronized hospitals. In 1960 the departments of technical, agricultural and musical literature were opened; the information service for culture and art was created. The general fund exceeded one million items in 1967. In the 1970s by the amount of work the Omsk Regional Research Library named after A.S. Pushkin got into the best ten out of seventy three analogues libraries in the country. On April 28, 1995 the library moved to a new building. The architectural and sculptural design of the library‚Äôs new building(eight sculptures and the surface of the side facade) was created by Vasily Trokhimchuk. The library achieved the status of the ‚ÄúCentral State Library of the Omsk Region.‚Äù The architectural and sculptural design Vasily Trokhimchuk began to work on the architectural and sculptural design of the new building in 1982. Eight sculptures with the height of 3,5 meters made of hammered blued copper are installed in the niches along the principal front. Those are the statues of the outstanding figures of Russia that personify a thousand-year history of the nation: the founder of Russian statehood Yaroslav the Wise, the leader spiritual renewal of Rus Sergius of Radonezh, the symbol of Old Russian art Andrei Rublev; outstanding representatives of Russian science, art, technological advances ‚Äì N.M. Karamzin, M.V. Lomonosov, M.N. Glinka, K.E. Tsiolkovsky. The image of A.S. Pushkin, whose name the library bears, has become the central figure of this sculptural pantheon. The statues of Alexander Pushkin and Andrei Rublev were created by the project author V.A. Trokhimchuk. Leningrad sculptors M.M. Ershov, L.Y. Kalibaba, V.I. Eremin made the other six. The statues were cast in mould in Leningrad at the art-production factory named after M.M. Torez. Their production was conducted by the cutting out sheet copper on the solid plaster model. The blessing and the installment of the sculptures on the pediment of the building took place in spring of 1993. The side fa√ßade of the library building is decorated with the relief. It doesn‚Äôt depict real historical events; it looks more like a philosophical account of mankind's history. The centre of the composition is the image of the Earth mother. At the right and at the left the figures of Icarus and Atlas stand out for their size. These figures are made in the largest scale which emphasizes the special place these mythological heroes take in the human history. Proportions of the rest figures (for about a hundred) depend on the importance of this or that character. The relief (its length is 30 meters) was made of clay (the Leningrad sculptor V.A. Eremin has taken part in the modeling). The knock down relief (11 parts) was delivered to Omsk by the railway and later it was installed at the site under the direction of the author.

In 1989, the series was adapted for more mainstream audiences on BBC1, and Screen One was born to follow the lead taken by Channel 4, whose many television films had later been released in Cinemas. Screen One attracted many names familiar to television and film audiences, including the likes of Alfred Molina, Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Ray Winstone, Alan Bates, Judi Dench, James Fox, Keith Allen, Bob Peck, Alun Armstrong, Marina Sirtis, David Jason, Brenda Blethyn, James Bolam, Adrian Edmondson, Alison Steadman, Timothy West, Clive Russell and Janet McTeer. Several actors also made their on-screen debuts during the series, including Keira Knightley in the fifth series episode Royal Celebration. By 1993, the prevailing mood within the BBC was to move away from single dramas and concentrate production on series and serials, and as such, a reduced six-episode series, broadcast in 1994, was to be the last full-length series of Screen One, although a further eight one-off specials followed, with the final episode being broadcast on 15 February 1998.

History  The ancient name of Bozdaƒü was Tmolos. It was a border town of Lydian Kingdom in the 6th century BC. After it was plundered by Achaemenid Empire of Persia it lost its importance. Ibn Battuta visited the Sultan Muhammad, son of Aydin, at his summer retreat located here, spending 14 days. While there Ibn Battuta examined a \\"stone that fell from the sky\\". According to unclaimed reports, During Ottoman era, it was a summer residence of Mehmet II while he was still a prince () governing in Manisa.Mayor's page In 1963 it was declared a township.  Economy  Fruits and vegetables are produced. At high altitude, the town is cooler than the surrounding and some houses are used as yayla, resortyayla (summer resort houses) for ƒ∞zmir or √ñdemi≈ü citizens. Winter tourism also seems to be promising.  Outdoor Sports Activities  Bozdaƒü is a beautiful area with Mount Bozdaƒü which attracts climbers, trackers and skiers. The Bozdaƒü Mountain is a perfect place for outdoor activities at a suitable altitude. The Mountain Bozdaƒü has an elevation of 2156 meters with different routes to hike, climb and ski from. Since it is located in a country with high temperatures, weather changes are common around the mountain and there can be unexpected changes which interferes with the plans of hikers, skiers and climbers. Therefore the ski season does not last a long time. The skiing resort on Mount Bozdaƒü is located 8 km away from the Bozdaƒü village. It has a cablelift which goes all the way up to the summit but it does not have long skiing pistes. The mountain is fit for trackers mainly during summer since there are no snow. The tracking routes require more skill, technical equipment and climbing knowledge to be able to complete successfully and safely.  History of Climbings  Mount Bozdaƒü has attracted climbers since 1980, mainly climbers from Izmir. The mountain has different routes which can be used by climbers. They come in different difficulty levels and the north face of the mountain has areas with risks of avalanches. There has been 2 deaths during the last 30 years on Mount Bozdaƒü. One of them due to falling on ice(January 1987), the other due to an avalanche(February 2013). The first climbings were accomplished by IDA (Izmir Daƒücƒ±lƒ±k Ajanlƒ±ƒüƒ±-Izmir Mountaineering Agency). The climbers followed a route which started and followed the west ridge of the mountain (this route is now known as \\"The Classic\\"). In February 1986, Mount Bozdaƒü was climbed successfully from the North Face and North Ridge of the Mountain for the first time by Mustafa Arif Demir and Mehmet Akif Demir. The most difficult and technical route of the mountain, Dik Deresi (Steep River) is a mix of rock, ice and snow. The first his route was climbed was in January 1995 by Mustafa Arif Demir and Muammer Yal√ßƒ±n. Ever since, the number of climbers has increased and there now is a winter celebration organized by IDADIK to climb Mount Bozdaƒü through different routes. One of the oldest climbing clubs in Turkey, IDADIK (Izmir Moutaineering and Nature Sports Speciality Club) encourages young climbers and people to climb and learn about the mountains in Turkey.

He lived and worked in both Britain and the United States. Life and career He was born in Vienna to Jewish parents, and aspired to be a composer from an early age. At the time of the German invasion of Austria in 1938, he escaped through Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands to England. His parents both died at Auschwitz. He initially worked in London cutting felt for hats, but began working as a songwriter with lyricist Peter Mulroney. He was then deported as an alien to Australia but, after being allowed to return to the UK, joined the British Army in which he served as an interpreter attached to a Canadian tank corps regiment in France and Germany. David Taylor, Label Profile: President Records, The Independent, 9 June 2008 He married in 1944, and with his wife Eileen set up his own music publishing company, the Edward Kassner Music Co. Ltd. He wrote songs under the name Eddie Cassen, and had his first success in 1946 as co-writer of Vera Lynn's hit recording of \\"How Lucky You Are\\". By the early 1950s, he had acquired rights to songs recorded by many leading singers of the day including Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Nat King Cole, and The Inkspots, and opened an office in New York City in 1951. He expanded the business by acquiring several other publishing companies, including Broadway Music Corp. which held the rights to a number of pop standards including \\"You Made Me Love You\\", \\"I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time\\" and \\"Take Me Out To The Ball Game\\". He also bought, for $250, the rights to the song \\"Rock Around The Clock\\", which became one of the most recorded songs of all time and reportedly sold over 170 million copies. In 1955, he and his business partners formed President Records in New York, but it had little success and was amalgamated into a larger company by 1961. He then formed another company, Seville Records, which had hits with \\"Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)\\" by Ernie Maresca and \\"Bobby's Girl\\" by Marcie Blane, but failed to capitalise on its early successes. He decided to reactivate the President label, partly inspired by the memory of John F. Kennedy after his assassination. Soon afterwards, in 1964, his London office acquired a management and publishing deal with a new group, The Kinks, who had a string of successful releases in both the UK and US starting with \\"You Really Got Me\\". With the British Invasion, Kassner decided to prioritise his activities in the UK, and launched the President label in Britain in 1966. The label's early successes were \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" and \\"The Best Part of Breaking Up\\" by The Symbols, a London band, and \\"I Feel Love Comin' On\\" by Felice Taylor. In 1968 the company had greater success with \\"Baby, Come Back\\" by The Equals, a UK no. 1 which also made the US chart and was followed up by a string of hits for the group in the UK. The company also set up a subsidiary label, Jay Boy, for releasing US singles on the TK and other labels in the UK, and had a series of hits in the 1970s with recordings by George McCrae and KC and the Sunshine Band. From the 1980s onwards, Kassner's company had particular success through its association with Rick Wakeman. In 1987 Edward Kassner signed up a young English band leader, Graham Dalby and his band The Grahamophones. Four albums followed plus a Children in Need single on the President label. One of the published songs by Dalby was used as the title of a BBC 2 documentary I'd Sooner Be A Crooner in 1988. Edward Kassner continued as head of his companies until his death in London in 1996 at the age of 76.

Plot Samantha Gray (Lynne Frederick), a famous figure skater, is engaged to London businessman Alan Falconer (John Leyton). On the day of Alan and Samantha's wedding, ex-convict William Haskin (Jack Watson) begins stalking Samantha. Over the next few days, Haskin terrifies Samantha by leaving bloody knives in various locations, including her home. Samantha tells her psychiatrist friend, Leonard Hawthorne (John Fraser), that Haskin was her mother's lover until he brutally stabbed her to death during an argument. Now that Haskin has been released from prison, Samantha thinks that he is trying to kill her. That night, Leonard is found murdered in his car, his throat slashed. Samantha's housekeeper, Mrs Wallace (Queenie Watts), takes Samantha to see her daughter Joy (Trisha Mortimer), a medium who channels Leonard's spirit and warns Samantha that the killer is close by. While making her way home, Joy is bludgeoned with a hammer and thrown under a moving bus. At Samantha's house, Samantha finds Mrs Wallace dead in the cellar, stabbed through the head. Samantha confronts Haskin at Alan's factory. Haskin tells Samantha that he is not a murderer and was wrongfully convicted: Samantha has a split personality, part of which is murderous, and killed her own mother. He explains that the bloody knives were intended as clues to force her to remember and confess. A physical struggle ensues, which ends with Haskin being fatally impaled on one of the factory machines. Some time later, Alan and Samantha depart for their honeymoon.

Lynne Frederick had known director Pete Walker since she was 14 years old (her mother was a friend and co-worker of Walker). However, Schizo is the only film that they worked on together. Frederick started work on the film just days after wrapping on Voyage of the Damned (1976). When Frederick was cast, Walker was under the impression that she still had the long ombr√© feathered hair fringe that she had in the film El vicio y la virtud (1975). However, unknown to Walker, Frederick had cut her hair short and dyed to her natural brunette for her role in Voyage of the Damned. At first shocked, Walker ultimately felt that Frederick's new shorter and darker hairstyle made her look more sophisticated and was better suited for her character in the film. Due to the film's low budget, many of Frederick's clothes came from her own personal wardrobe. Frederick had worn many of these outfits the previous year in A Long Return (1975). Release The release of Schizo (1976) was rushed to coincide with the anticipated success of Frederick‚Äôs highly acclaimed performance in Voyage of the Dammed (1976). It was hoped that the success of that film would garner a following for Frederick and bring in extra earnings for this film. Ultimately this plan backfired and the film was released in the UK on 11 November 1976, nearly a month before Voyage of the Dammed, and did not generate the desired buzz. The film received a release in the US on 7 December 1977. Critical reception Time Out wrote: \\"Walker and writer David McGillivray's most ambitious project to date attempts to shake off the low-budget horror/exploitation tag with a move into more up-market psychological suspense. If the formula is threadworn - a trail of victimisation, sexual paranoia, and murder in the wake of the heroine's wedding - at least some effort is made to locate it (rich middle class London). But things collapse disastrously in the second half. Caught between sending itself up and taking itself seriously, the film ends closer to the silliness of Francis Durbridge than to the menace of Alfred Hitchcock.\\" Legacy Although the film was not a success during its initial release, it became a cult classic in the horror movie community. The underground success of the film was in part due to Lynne Frederick‚Äôs new found cult fanbase. This film, along with Vampire Circus (1971), helped establish Frederick as a scream queen icon of the 1970s.

The book was described as a \\"zombie romance\\" by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and makes allusions to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The author, based in Seattle, originally wrote a short story titled \\"I Am a Zombie Filled with Love\\". Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, acquired the publishing rights to the full novel in early 2010. Plot In a post-apocalyptic future, a male zombie still in the early stages of decay lives in a community of the dead in an abandoned airport near the city. He cannot remember his name, and refers to himself as \\"R\\". After the collapse of human civilization, zombies hunt for the living, seeking to eat their brains; doing so allows them to relive the memories, feelings, and thoughts of their prey. Zombies whose flesh has completely decayed away are known as \\"Boneys\\", which act as \\"pack leaders\\" of sorts to the others, who are known as \\"Fleshies\\" and still retain traces and behaviors from their previous lives as humans, though R explains that most of the behaviors are done out of force of habit rather than an attempt to \\"live\\". R, a Fleshy, is unusual as he shows distaste for eating human flesh, and can form several coherent syllables in one breath, and collects various objects from the outside world that he hoards in his \\"house\\", a Boeing 747 airliner parked at the airport. In a hunt, R feeds on the brain of a young man named Perry. After experiencing his memories, R sees Perry's girlfriend Julie, and in a moment of mercy, saves her from the others. He disguises her scent with zombie blood, and takes her home where he hides her in the 747 airplane. He slowly gains Julie's trust, and convinces her to stay for a while until the others forget about her. R feeds her food from the airport's restaurant, entertains her with his treasures, including a record player, and Julie tries to teach him to drive a car which R has managed to get started. She also tells him a little bit about her life. In time, R begins feeling guilty over killing Perry, but continues to eat the remains of his brain, seeing it as a rare treasure, and experiences many of Perry's memories. Julie is attacked by several zombies, and R helps her fend them off. His fellow zombie M is confused and angered by his behavior, but relents his attack. However, several Boneys, attracted by the noise, arrive, and one of them shows R some old photos of the dead and living fighting each other, telling him that they need to maintain the status quo. They leave along with the rest, and R takes Julie back to the airplane. In the morning, Julie convinces R to take her home, and they leave while the dead watch them. The Boneys attack and try to kill Julie, but with M's help, they get away in R's car. On the way to the city, they camp out in a suburban house, and Julie allows R to share a bed with her. The next morning, Julie calls her father, and sends R out for fuel. When he returns, Julie is gone. R begins walking back to the airport in a heavy rainstorm, and feels cold for the first time since he \\"died\\". On the road, R runs into M and some other zombies who have been chased out by the Boneys. M explains that, ever since the confrontation with the Boneys in the airport, the zombies have been changing like R, and experiencing things such as dreams and old memories. R decides to go after Julie, and follows her scent to an abandoned stadium converted into a large community for human survivors, led by Julie's father Grigio. After disguising himself as a human, R locates Julie's house and sees her on her balcony, and they reunite. R has further visions of Perry's memory; some form of Perry's soul is living inside R, and has intertwined with R's own. He also realizes that Perry and Julie had started to become distant from each other shortly before Perry's death, largely due to Perry beginning to lose his will to live. During a party in the community, R becomes intoxicated, and, no longer able to control his zombie instincts, attacks a guard, infecting him and causing a small outbreak in the stadium. Grigio discovers R, and, deducing what he is, attacks him despite Julie's protests, but is stopped by Julie's friend Nora, allowing Julie and R to escape. Outside, the crowd of zombies has grown. What Julie and R have between them has infected many others, causing them to change and seek to regain their humanity. However, as they deliberate on what to do next, the Boneys attack both the Living and Fleshies alike. The couple meets up with Nora, and they flee to a roof where they see the battle between the Boneys and the Living. As they watch, Julie has an epiphany: the plague started because the human race crushed itself beneath the weight of its negative emotions, until it released a dark force that changed the humans so that everyone could see their evil. In the midst of the chaos and bloodshed, R and Julie kiss; the strength of their love cures R of the plague completely and both their eyes turn gold. Grigio, not believing that a cure for the plague exists and thinking that R has infected Julie, attempts to kill them both, but is stopped by one of his own soldiers and attacked by a Boney. As Julie shoots the Boney, both it and Grigio fall off the roof of the stadium shriveling into dust and bones. The action apparently causes the rest of the Boneys to flee, and the battle ends with the Living and Dead establishing peace. The epilogue reveals that in the aftermath of the battle, the word about the origins of the plague was spread among the other surviving communities, allowing for a true chance at a cure, and R looks forward to what the future now brings, for the Living and the Dead both. Reviews Paste Magazine said, \\"Marion explores the meaning of humanity through R's journey towards personhood, a tale that gets grander in scale as his empathy builds and the book's true villains‚Äîcynicism, apathy and status quo‚Äîare revealed.\\" Related books =Prequel= On January 28, 2013, Zola Books published Isaac Marion's novella e-book prequel to Warm Bodies, titled The New Hunger.

Cinema Blend gave a mostly positive review, remarking that it \\"feels more like an add-on to Warm Bodies than a self-contained story\\" but stating that fans of Warm Bodies would enjoy the novella. =Sequel= On October 15, 2012, Marion announced via his blog that he was writing a sequel. Three years later, he announced that the project had grown into two books, making the series four books in total. The first of these, titled The Burning World, was released on February 7, 2017, and Marion launched an elaborate campaign to encourage preordering through his own web store, creating original story materials as rewards. Marion self-published a limited run of the final book in the series, The Living, on November 13, 2018. Adaptations =Film= Actor Nicholas Hoult starred as the zombie R in a feature film adaptation written and directed by Jonathan Levine and released in February 2013. The film also starred Teresa Palmer as Julie Grigio, Rob Corddry as M, and John Malkovich as General Grigio. Other principal cast members included Dave Franco, Analeigh Tipton, and Cory Hardrict. In the film, Julie's father is not killed and though a stadium is used for certain scenes, a city barred with walls replaces it as the humans' primary residence. The official movie poster in which R was giving Julie a bunch of flowers is not included in the movie but happened in the novel. There were also cut-scenes that were not included in the officially released movie that changed the flow of the story. =Television= In May 2019, a Warm Bodies television series adaptation was announced to be in development, produced by Lionsgate.https://www.slashfilm.com/warm-bodies-tv- series/ References External links * Author's site * Author's blog * \\"Boarded Window (Warm Bodies 0.6 prelude) by Isaac Marion Category:2010 American novels Category:American zombie novels Category:American romance novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Fiction narrated by a dead person Category:Human-zombie romance in fiction Category:Works based on Romeo and Juliet Category:Novels based on plays Category:2010 debut novels ","title":"Warm Bodies"},{"id":"33227750","text":"Yenika≈ü is a village in Aydƒ±ncƒ±k district of Mersin Province, Turkey.

It is made from a recipe invented in the 18th century. Registered in 1850, it's one of the oldest snus brands in existence.  Origins  Petter Swartz (1726‚Äì1789) grew up in the Bergslagen mining region up north. When arriving to the town of Norrk√∂ping, he first introduced the Italian double-entry bookkeeping, then he started his own snus factory in 1753. Together with his brother, Olof Swartz, they transformed the small business by implementing an efficient manufacturing process. Among other things, they constructed a horse-propelled grinder with a giant cog- wheel. Later they would use water for powering their factory complex. When production was at its peak, the Norrk√∂ping tobacco fields covered an area of almost 395000 square meters. Harvested tobacco was air cured in three large wooden barns. Seven different recipes were the backbone of the Swartz empire. The most famous and also most successful was R√∂da Lacket (The Red Seal) which was soon sold in Stockholm and later all over the country. The company The company, along with the snus recipes, was passed on from father to son through six generations. The family became very wealthy and started to contribute to the development of the town of Norrk√∂ping; most notably through financing the public library and the town's arts museum. In 1772, Petter Swartz founded a private school where students were taught both double-entry bookkeeping and carpentry ‚Äì skills that were needed in the snus business. After the monopolization in 1915, the Swedish snus manufacturing was centralized. The success of R√∂da Lacket, however, delayed the closing of the tobacco harvesting in Norrk√∂ping by several years. Products R√∂da Lacket has a mild, fruity taste, with tones of licorice. It's a fine-grain type of snus, which has earned it a reputation among Swedish snusers for being the easiest snus to hand mold. Today it is sold in two qualities: * R√∂da Lacket Vit Portion (discontinued) ‚Äì a white portion snus in cans of 24 portions of 0,9 gram * R√∂da Lacket L√∂ssnus ‚Äì loose snus; 42 grams per can References Category:Snus Category:Tobacco brands Category:Swedish brands ","title":"R√∂da Lacket"},{"id":"33227795","text":"Alfredo del √Åguila Estrella (3 January 1935 - 26 July 2018) was a Mexican football forward who played for Mexico in the 1962 FIFA World Cup.1962 FIFA World Cup Chile He also played for Deportivo Toluca and Club de Futbol America.

The mountain range is located between the provinces of Batangas, Laguna and Quezon. It is popular among mountaineers, and has three interconnected destinations: Mt. Malepunyo, the highest; Bagwis Peak (also known as Mt. Susong-Cambing); and Mount Dalaga (also known as Manabu Peak). History Bagwis Cliff, also known as Susong-Cambing or Susong-Dalaga The Malepunyo Range is an inactive volcano to which its caldera is facing south along the vicinity between Lipa City and San Antonio, Quezon. By the 1990s the Malepunyo Mountain Range has been erroneously tagged as Malarayat Mountain Range due to the famous country club located at its western slope named after the Malarayat Hill. Mount Malepunyo is its highest peak located at Barangay Talisay, Lipa City standing at above mean sea level by the ridge of its caldera. The second highest peak of the range is Mt. Dalaga standing at above mean sea level situated at the boundary of Santo Tomas, Batangas and Alaminos, Laguna. During the 1990s, the name was changed by the locals of Santo Tomas to Manabu as a shortened Tagalog phrase Mataas na Bundok which means \\"High Mountain\\". At the center of the mountain range is a cliff known as Bagwis Cliff by the locals, yet due to its shape that resembles a goat's breast, it is also called as Susong-Kambing (en:Goat's Breast). In time, mountaineers have also mistakenly named this cliff as Susong Dalaga (en. maiden's breast) which is actually the oldest name of Manabu Peak. A discontinued highway project connecting San Pablo City and Lipa City that traverses the central part of the mountain range made way for the creation of what the mountaineers call as Biak na Bundok (en. Sliced Mountain). Physical Characteristics Malepunyo Range Relief Map on 1 arc second/30-meter resolution The Malepunyo mountain range has four notable peaks: :*Mount Malepunyo (Malipunyo) above mean sea level :*Mount Dalaga (Manabu Peak / Susung Dalaga) above mean sea level :*Bagwis Peak (Susung Dalaga / Susung Cambing) above mean sea level :*Malarayat Hill above mean sea level Product The mountain range is a famous source of Alamid Coffee due to civet cats that chew on coffee beans and ferments the seeds inside its digestive system. The fermented coffee beans are then excreted along the trails and is cleaned and pulverized for coffee preparation. Hiking The jurisdiction of the Malepunyo Range is separated into two. The Manabu peak is under the jurisdiction of Santo Tomas, Batangas to which its jump-off is at Sitio Sulok. It resembles an easy trail to which a cross has been erected on its summit while a plateau beside it is used as a saddle camp. The southern half is under the jurisdiction of Lipa City, Batangas and the jump-off is located at Sitio Talisay. To which the trail leads to the summit of Mount Malepunyo.(2007-10-25).\\"Mt.

She was a contemporary artist of embroidery and the master of Changzhou needlework embroidery. Changzhou needlework embroidery is the combination of the traditional Chinese embroidery and the Western oil painting. Manufacturing processes Doing Changzhou needlework embroidery requires some oil painting skills because the first step is to draw a draft. And then the embroidery can be done. The production of Changzhou needlework embroidery requires piercing three layers of cloth. The first layerÔºåaccording to the painted draft and the color lumps, is to make the background colored, cursorily. The thread should be thicker and longer. The second layer needs careful dealing and should pay attention to the production orders. The larger and back area needs to be done first and the following is the smaller and front part. In addition, the most important part has to do some further dealing. The third layer is to process meticulously and pay more attention to the changes of lines, lights and colors. Characteristics One characteristic of the Changzhou needlework embroidery is ‚Äòdisorder‚Äô. However, the \\"disorder\\" doesn't mean \\"being unsystematic\\". It has its own rules. Another is paying more attention to the color effects. Changzhou needlework embroidery has more layers than other embroidery so as to have different color effects.

Formed in 2008, the Group consists of Bar Sanitovsky (vocals, guitar), Yarden Mor-Avi (guitar), Boris Skolyar (bass), Tomshi Shein (keyboards) and Erez Nadler (drums). The band is considered to be extreme heavy metal. Since the band‚Äôs formation, they have released one studio album, and two demos.  History  = Early years (2008‚Äì2010) = While vocalist and guitarist Bar Sanitovsky started his interest in music as a classical pianist at age 6, Bar‚Äôs family immigrated to Israel from Germany after World War II, bassist Boris Skolyar‚Äôs family immigrated from Ukraine and guitarist Yarden Mor-Avi immigrated from The United States at childhood, the members met at school and at local Heavy Metal shows and slowly gathered, found and identified with one another due to shared interest in Metal music and the Metal scene. Shortly after, the members decided to form a band and as it is told, they looked for a suitable name and eventually settled on the name Ekho, after the voiceless Mountain nymph Echo from Greek mythology. \\"We heard the name and thought its awesome because we feel that kids today many times dont have their own voice and that people should stop giving a fuck about what other people think and just do what they want.\\"(Magic Fire Music Interview). After the band put out several demos, they released their debut album Spitefull on August 1, 2011. = Nymph (2009) = Ekho was founded in 2008 by vocalist and guitarist Bar Sanitovsky and guitarist Yarden Mor-Avi. In early 2009, Ekho recorded its first demo, a four track release entitled ‚ÄòNymph‚Äô, which was a live-recorded demo tape done in their rehearsal room. The musical direction of the band at this early state is usually described as a form of melodic death metal with thrash metal influences. = Among The Shadows of Erebus (2009) = In mid-2009, after the release of Nymph, Bar and Yarden began writing material with a new more melodic approach for Ekho‚Äôs next release, a demo, which was released later that year titled ‚ÄòAmong The Shadows of Erebus‚Äô. In this demo, keyboards, which were used regularly throughout the new songs, were added to Ekho‚Äôs music and the band‚Äôs new sound let the keyboards function as an accompaniment for the new focus on guitar melodies and technically intricate solos. = Spitefull (2011) = A year and a half later, after Among the Shadows of Erebus, the band finished writing and recording new material for its first full-length album, Spitefull, which was released on August 1, 2011. With an integration of demo tracks with new tracks, the band recorded and co-produced the album with Meir Gur at Black Horizon Studios (Natanya, Israel) and mixed it with Ahti Kortelainen at Tico-Tico studio (Kemi, Finland). The album contains seven tracks and features illustrations by the Polish artist Jaroslaw Marcineck in collaboration with tattoo artist Leon Levakov. A music video for \\"Departure\\" was released on September 27, 2011. The video was directed and produced by Karin Azulay and Yuval Shuchenacky.  Musical characteristics and lyrical themes  Ekho's music consists of elements from a range of heavy metal genres ‚Äì melodic death metal, symphonic black metal, power metal, heavy metal, neo- classical metal and progressive metal. Their style has been compared to the earlier work of the Finnish extreme metal band, Children of Bodom, and their music has described as \\"a blend of Scandinavian influenced fast paced melodic metal with neo-classical metal and heavy metal.\\" During the band's demo period, Ekho wrote about scenarios and emotions from their lives mainly through mythological, epic and atmospheric metaphors. More recently, the band writes its lyrics through a clear, more accessible attitude and tends to use less of an indirect \\"artistic\\" tone and more straightforward portrayal. In a song that was featured on their latest album entitled 'Frail Lie', is about the band dealing with the frustration and anger in a relationship where one of the sides acts with dishonesty and hypocrisy. A similar topic is featured in 'The Sprite' - the band's lead vocalist and guitarist, Bar Sanitovsky, explains that \\"The song pretty much deals with the struggles of the typical 'boy wants girl that he can't have' kind of thing, which probably everyone knows.\\"  Band members  = Current members = * Bar Sanitovsky ‚Äì vocals, guitars (2008‚Äìpresent) * Yarden Mor-Avi ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (2008‚Äìpresent) * Boris Skolyar ‚Äì bass (2008‚Äìpresent) * Tomshi Shein ‚Äì keyboards (2008‚Äìpresent) * Erez Nadler ‚Äì drums, percussion (2008‚Äìpresent)  Discography  = Studio albums = * Spitefull 2011 = Demos = * Nymph (album) (2009) *#\\"Refined Macabre\\" *#\\"Obliterate\\" *#\\"Eye For An Eye\\" *#\\"Nymph\\" * Among The Shadows of Erebus (2009) *#\\"Among The Shadows of Erebus\\" *#\\"Waters of Abyss\\" *#\\"Silent Mourning\\" *#\\"Across\\"  References   External links  *Ekho on Facebook *Ekho on Encyclopedia Metallum Category:Israeli heavy metal musical groups ","title":"Ekho (band)"},{"id":"33228052","text":"Ramiro Navarro de Anda (born 25 May 1943) is a Mexican football forward who played for Mexico in the 1966 FIFA World Cup.1966 FIFA World Cup England Career Born in Tepatitl√°n, Jalisco, Navarro began playing football with Club Deportivo Tener√≠a.

A ' (in Spanish), ' (in Catalan), roughly meaning 'bull with balls', is a festive activity, typical of many towns in Spain (mainly in the Valencian community and Southern Catalonia), in which a bull that has balls of flammable material attached to its horns, which are set on fire, is set free in the streets at night, and participants dodge the bull when it comes close. It can be considered a variant of an ( in Catalan). This activity is held in a number of Spanish towns during their local festivals. In recent years, animal welfare activists have attempted to stop this practice due to the cruelty to the animal. The animal is usually tied to a post and then teams of people prevent it from moving while a wooden frame with two spikes with balls of flammable material is attached to its horns. These are then set alight and the rope is cut. Sometimes fireworks are attached too, which then go off shortly afterwards. There is usually a barricade separating the bull from the spectators. A somewhat similar activity is the , in which the live bull is replaced by a bull-shaped metal frame (held by a runner) which is set alight.

History  =Utrecht= The family was already noble from earliest times (\\"Uradel\\"). The first known ancestor is the knight Steven van Zulen, who early in the 13th century settled in Utrecht. His descendants married into leading families and built the castle called Zuylen. They later joined Nievelt to their family name, being the name of an estate and castle ' (\\"new field\\") they had acquired. Their main fortune was a result of their activities in impoldering morasses. From the 19th century to the present, the name of the family was written as Van Zuylen van Nievelt. Members received recognition of nobility in 1814 and the title of baron was confirmed in 1822. Several members of the family lived in Barneveld where they built a castle named Schaffelaar. The Dutch branch of the family became extinct in 1947. A family Van Zuylen van Nijevelt, originating from Rotterdam, must not be confused with this family. =Belgium= In the 17th century, Pieter-Frederic van Zuylen (1604‚Äì1691) was the first of the family to settle in the catholic southern parts of the Netherlands, nowadays Belgium..

This was granted as follows: * 1816: Jean-Jacques van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar (he had inherited the estate of de Haar, from a childless member of the Dutch van Zuylens). * 1827: Jean- Baptiste van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1755‚Äì1837) * 1827: Marie-Dominique van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1769‚Äì1846) * 1828: the sons of Joseph van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1761‚Äì1824): Jean-Joseph (1802‚Äì1883), Guy (1809‚Äì1852), the godfather of Guido Gezelle and Frederic (1814‚Äì1881). * 1855: the sons of Andr√©-Patrice van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1772‚Äì1849): Jean-Jacques (1801‚Äì1875) and Andr√© (1805‚Äì1882). Of the eight sons of Jean-Bernard van Zuylen, only Jean-Jacques (who had thirteen children) has male descendants up to this day. The eldest branch inherited the De Haar estate near Utrecht. They are the branch known as van Zuylen van Nijevelt van de Haar. The last male heir died in 2011. One of the sons of Jean-Bernard, Fran√ßois van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1764‚Äì1835) was accepted within the Bavarian nobility. This branch became extinct for the males in 1906 with the death of Fran√ßois-Ghislain van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1836‚Äì1906) and in 1953 the last female member of the family died, Linda van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1874‚Äì1953). =Notable members of the Belgian family Van Zuylen van Nyevelt= * Jean-Jacques van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar (1752‚Äì1846), MP, mayor of Bruges. **Gustave van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar (1818‚Äì1890), diplomat, married Julie Visart de Bocarm√© (1823‚Äì1862) and baroness Leontine van Lockhorst (1830‚Äì1906) ***Etienne van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar (1860‚Äì1934), was able to restore thoroughly the De Haar estate, with the financial support of his wife H√©l√®ne de Rothschild (1863‚Äì1947).

Petrus Bertius, 1787 engraving by Reinier Vinkeles. Early life He was born in Beveren (Alveringem), the son of a Flemish preacher Pieter Michielszoon Bardt, who left Flanders for religious exile in London around 1568, with his family. In 1577 Petrus Bertius returned to the Netherlands, to study at the University of Leiden. He supported himself by tutoring younger students and continued travelling in Europe. In 1593 he was appointed to subregent of the Leiden Statencollege, marrying in the same year Maritgen, daughter of Johannes Kuchlinus, the first regent of the Statencollege, whom he would succeeded after his death in 1606 as a regent. He was also connected by marriage to Jodocus Hondius and Pieter van den Keere, his brothers-in-law and both cartographers, and this would influence his later life.Walter A. Goffart, Historical atlases: the first three hundred years, 1570-1870 (2003), p. 70. Philosophy & Theology Bertius wrote an introduction to Boethius's Consolations of Philosophy, which was published in Giovanni Antonio Volpi's edition of the text in 1721. Bertius was a friend of Jacobus Arminius, and spoke at his funeral in 1609. A controversy arose with Francis Gomarus, the chief opponent of Arminianism, on the basis of the published version of the funeral oration. Bertius held views on essential doctrines that were unwelcome even to his friends. He held views close to Semipelagianism. In 1612 Bertius published Hymenaeus desertor, a Latin work that went further than Arminius in theology, against the advice of fellow Remonstrants. The Hymenaeus desertor was widely circulated, but was unpopular: William Louis, Count of Nassau- Dillenburg disliked it, and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt with other politicians felt that Bertius had gone against them. Bertius persisted, however, in 1613 with a Dutch translation, which he reprinted in 1615 in Leiden. Eventually Bertius lost his teaching position, and was also forbidden to give private lessons. Later life In 1618 Bertius was given an appointment as a cosmographer to the court of Louis XIII. His career in cartography had started in 1598, with the publication of a Latin edition of a miniature atlas Caert Thresoor by Barent Langenes,Carl Moreland and David Bannister, Antique Maps (1986), p. 105. which he translated as Tabulae contractae (1600). His Theatrum geographiae veteris had commended him to King Louis. When his academic prospects in the Netherlands were cut down, he went to France. He became in 1620 a convert to the Roman Catholic Church, and also whereupon professor of rhetoric at the Coll√®ge de Boncourt, a part of the University of Paris. In 1622 Louis XIII set up a new personal chair in mathematical sciences in the royal college for Bertius, and granted him the title of royal historian. He died in Paris.

It is 360.5 km (580 miles) long and drains an area of 17,600 km2 (6,795 sq. mi.) with a heavy sediment load. The Xin River Basin is bounded by the Huaiyu Mountains to the north and east and by the Wuyi Shan to the south and east. Huanggang Shan is 2,158 m tall, the highest mountain in Jiangxi Province, on the southern edge of the basin. The mountain passes of Fenshui Guan and Fengling Guan are on the southeastern edge of the Xin River Basin. Shan (Â±±) and guan (ÂÖ≥) mean mountain and pass in Chinese, respectively. The Xin River can be divided into upstream, midstream and downstream sections. The upper reaches of river are in mountainous, undulating terrain. The middle reaches of the river basin gradually reduce in slope as the river flows west. In the Poyang Lake area downstream the river enters a flat open alluvial plain. Likewise, 40% of the Xin River basin, in the east end, is mountainous and the rest of the area is hills (35%) and plains (25%). Climate The Xin River Basin has a sub-tropical monsoon climate. Rainfall generally begins in April and gradually increases with some areas receiving up to 2000 mm or more annually. In July to September the weather is often controlled by a subtropical high, with local thunderstorms and rain, and eventually rain becomes scarce. The basin's average annual temperature in 18¬∞C; annual average rainfall is 1845 mm with less in the eastern mountains than in the west. Economy The area of Poyang Lake is a major rice growing area while wheat and tea are grown in the upper reaches of the Xin River. The Xin River basin has a human population of more than 4 million. About 83% of the arable land in the basin is used for paddy fields. Cities along the river From its headwaters the Xin River flows south from the vicinity of the city of Yushan, east through or near towns of Shangrao, Yanshan, Yiyang, Guixi, and Yingtan, Yujiang, Yugan, and then northeast into Poyang Lake east of the city of Nanchang. Dams The Xin River has three large reservoirs, the Jiepai Navigation and Hydropower Plant at Yingtan City and on its tributaries the Jin Shaxi Yushan Qiyi Reservoir, the largest of the Xin River Basin reservoirs, and the Luxi River Shangrao Da'ao Reservoir. A river diversion project has a flow of 19 cubic meters per second use to irrigate rice fields. Environmental protection Local governments are working together to address significant environmental problems. The Xin River Basin has had industrial pollution including from the Kanayama Guixi Yongping Copper Mine as the largest source of pollution. In recent years, with the economic development of the basin, addressing the pollution of the river channel has become increasingly important. In 2005, Zhejiang Province ordered heavy polluters to clean up and worked with local officials providing incentives to resolve pollution issues. The enterprises of the watershed included mostly papermaking, metallurgy, chemical, and pharmaceutical companies, with the most serious hazardous chemicals being fluoride and fluorine. Many companies do not have sewage treatment facilities, so that sewage is discarded into the river without any treatment. In 2012, water pollution, low water levels, and human activities had been negatively impacting scaly-sided merganser, and endangered species which uses the river, although closure of a sand mine had had positive effects.Shao, Mingqin; Zeng, Binbin; Tim, Hounsome; Chen, Lixin; You, Chaying; Wang, Hongbin; Dai, Nianhua. 2012.

Matisoff (2009) considers Puroik to be a Tibeto-Burman language that has undergone sound changes such as: *Proto-Tibeto-Burman nasals > voiced stops *Proto-Tibeto- Burman *-a > -i Lieberherr (2015) also considers Puroik to be a Tibeto-Burman language, although he notes that it has likely borrowed from non-Tibetan- Burman languages. However, Roger Blench (2011) considers Puroik to be a language isolate.Blench, Roger. 2011. (De)classifying Arunachal languages: Reconsidering the evidence Grammar The Sulung grammar notes here have been adapted primarily from Tayeng (1990).Tayeng, Aduk. 1990. Sulung language guide. Shillong: The Director of Information and Public Relations, Arunachal Pradesh =Number= Number is not considered a grammatical feature in Sulung. Plurality is expressed, when required to be stated clearly by the huangda meaning all, many, etc. =Gender= There is no grammatical gender in Sulung. However the two sexes are distinguished when necessary. To indicate other relatives and persons the suffix -aphu is added for the male and -amua for the female. Demonstrative, and Interrogative. =Case= Seven cases may be distinguished: Subject (Nominative), Object (Accusative), Instrumental, Dative (Purposive), Ablative, Possessive (Genitive), and Locative. =Pronoun= The Personal Pronoun distinguished three persons (the first person, second person, and third person) and two numbers (singular and plural). The same form is used for both genders. =Adjective= There are four types of adjectives: adjective of quality, adjective of quantity, demonstrative adjective, interrogative adjective. =Verb= Sulung verbs do not indicate number and person. =Tense= The three principal tenses (present, past, and future), including the indefinite and the continuous are indicated by means of particles used as suffixes. =Moods= There are four moods: Imperative, potential, conditional, and subjunctive. Imperative uses the suffix -bo, -da, and -ge for commands. Potential uses the suffix -pa to express the ability to perform. Conditional uses -re/-hangra to express obligation. =Adverb= Adverbs may be distinguished into four classes: Time, place, manner, and interrogative. Vocabulary The following list of 181 words in three Puroik dialects, in addition to Proto-Puroik (the reconstructed proto-language of the Puroik lects), is from Lieberherr (2015: 280‚Äì286).

The act repealed the laws allowing for the death penalty and amended various other laws referring to death sentences or capital offences. It also established a procedure by which existing death sentences could be converted to prison sentences, and fixed minimum sentences for certain serious crimes. The act came into force on 13 November 1998, except for the minimum sentencing provisions, which came into force on 1 May 1998. Background The Interim Constitution of South Africa, which came into force on 27 April 1994, created for the first time in South Africa a justiciable bill of rights; section nine of that bill of rights stated that, \\"Every person shall have the right to life.\\" The Constitutional Court was also created by the Interim Constitution; the first case on which it heard argument was S v Makwanyane and Another, a test case to determine the constitutionality of the death penalty. On 6 June 1995 the court handed down its judgment, ruling that the death penalty violated the right to life, the right to dignity, and the protection against cruel and inhuman punishment. The judgment invalidated the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act that allowed for capital punishment, and any similar provision in any other law in force. The court also ruled that prisoners already sentenced to death could not be executed, and that they should remain in prison until their sentences were set aside and replaced according to law. Provisions =Replacement of sentences= Section 1 of the act established the procedure for replacing death sentences. For people sentenced to death and whose appeals were exhausted, the Minister of Justice was required to refer each case back to the court which had imposed the death sentence, to be heard by the judge who had imposed the sentence, if possible, or by another judge of that court. The judge would then receive written argument from the prosecuting authority and from the convict, and determine an appropriate sentence. The President would then exercise the power of commutation to set aside the death sentence and replace it by the sentence determined by the court. In cases where an appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal was pending, and that appeal was against the sentence only, the case was to be referred back to the original court for a new sentence to be imposed. In cases where an appeal against the conviction was pending, the Supreme Court of Appeal was required to impose a new sentence when it ruled on the appeal. =Repeal of laws= The act repealed sections 276(1)(a), 277, 278 and 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA), which made the death sentence a valid sentence for certain offences and established the procedure for carrying it out. It also amended other sections of the CPA and various other acts which referred to the death sentence or to capital offences. It made similar amendments to the Defence Act to abolish capital punishment in the military justice system. A schedule to the act contained similar amendments to laws of the formerly independent bantustans, which remained in force for their territories. =Minimum sentences= Sections 51 to 53 of the act provided for certain minimum sentences to be required for certain serious crimes. These mandatory sentencing provisions were initially to have effect only for two years, subject to extension by Presidential proclamation. Such extensions were repeatedly made to keep the provisions in force until 2007, when the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Amendment Act, 2007 made them permanent. The act prescribes life imprisonment for certain convictions of murder or rape; subsequent amendments added certain terrorism-related crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and human trafficking. Various lesser minimum sentences are prescribed for other crimes, including 15 years for a first conviction of murder, 20 years for a second conviction, and 25 years for any third or subsequent conviction.

History The village of Santo Andre de Almo√ßageme The settlement was constructed between the 3rd and 5th centuries. In the 17th century a funerary inscription, unrelated to the physical structures was discovered, implying a more intricate history. In 1905, a polychromatic mosaic was discovered, in addition to artefacts linked to its Roman history. The first official archaeological excavations began between 1980 and 1990: these excavations exposed a large area of the main house (pars urbana) that included several rooms with mosaic pavements to the north (that included peristyle). In the excavated pars rustica a brick oven was discovered, used for producing ceramics. Later, the structures became derelict and in the adjoining spaces a grave was discovered, where two newborn children were buried. Architecture Inscriptions along the perimeter of the triangular plan is delimited by metallic fence, defining the structures of the town. The settlement includes walls composed of an irregular masonry in height. Its plan is essentially comprises various rectangular spaces, many corresponding to halls and paved with mosaics (in the north and west). In the excavated areas, there are two rectangular, plaster tanks: one situated at the end of the wall and the other irregular, located near a bunk of tiles. Also located near the excavated zone is a brick oven and child's burial grave, both near to each other.

History The existence of a Roman sanctuary dates to the 2nd to 3rd century A.D., when the lands overlooking the coast were dedicated to Sun, Moon and Imperial cult. At that time a circular temenos, an open air religious space, was used by holders of high imperial positions in the territory. Little is known about the intervening years, although a Moorish settlement occupied the lands sometime in the 12th century. The group eventually disappeared, and the area was abandoned. Much of the stonework was used by locals to build their own residences or used in public construction. The re-discovery of these ruins date back to Valentim Fernandes in 1505; and Francisco d'Ollanda, around 1541, with the latter including designs and observations of the structures, which he observed were a Roman sanctuary. The identification of these ruins, corresponded to the first archeological discovery in Portugal. Its importance was largely recognized by the number of local, national and international visitors during the Renaissance. Among the illustrious visitors were members of the Portuguese Royal Family, namely King D. Manuel, and later, the Infante D. Lu√≠s, brother of King D. John III. These descriptions suggest that the site was visitable during the 16th century, at a time when the structures were largely submerged in the sand. Yet, local memory helped the stories to continue, and the existence of a Roman sanctuary along the Sintrense beach remained in the minds of locals, even as its specific location could not be identified. Various studies and scientific work finally identified its presence on a small hilltop escarpment overlooking the Praia das Ma√ß√£s, known locally as the Alto da Vigia and Alconchel. A team from the Archaeological Museum of S√£o Miguel de Odrinhas began excavations in 2008, alongside a tower structure, unearthing a monumental Roman sanctuary. Architecture The site is situated above cliffs overlooking the beach of Praia das Ma√ß√£s, on barren lands. The complex includes a Roman sanctuary and a tower dating from the 16th century. In addition, there were also identified vestiges from the Islamic epoch, totally unknown until their discovery, although the toponymy Alconchel (al-concilium) may have alluded to its presence. Architectural artefacts from the Moorish period correspond to a ribat (or convent) that included various halls, with a mirhab oriented towards the southwest (in the direction of Mecca). The remaining materials associated with the Moors are residual, and include ceramics from the 12th century (likely associated the final phase of occupation), as well as shells and fires (suggesting a link between the coastal activities and food for these locals. In addition to the buildings, an area of graves were identified without any artefacts linked to the Islamic presence. The structures of the ribat also reused many of the architectural elements of the Roman epoch, that identifiable by the inscriptions, already identified by Fernandes and d'Ollanda during their excavations in the 16th century. The importance of the sanctuary during the Roman period is reflected in the votive inscriptions, expressing health to the Emperor and long life to the Empire. These wishes are not normally associated with particular devotees, nor by local or provincial elites, but suggest that they were contracted by members of the Imperial class, namely governors of Lusitania or Imperial legates, by way of the Senate of Olissipo. The inscriptions were dedicated by Sextus Tigidius Perennis, governor of Lusitania, to the Soli et Lunae in 185 AD; between 200 and 209 by Junius Celanius, a governor, to the Soli aeterno Lunae and by Caius Julius Celsus, procurator province Lusitaniae in the late 2nd century. During excavations an inscription was recovered that attests to the importance of the local, since it was dedicated to the Sun and the Ocean, by a procurator of Agustus Cesear, and his family. In addition to the altar and funerary inscription, there were other Roman architectural elements discovered on the site, including a framed pots, fragments of columns and altars and large blocks for construction.

Sarrell was organized as a non-profit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization in 2005, and currently operates 17 dental clinics, 4 clinics include vision care and a mobile dental bus. Beginnings In 2004, retired cardiologist, Dr. Warren Sarrell, conducted a health assessment survey in Calhoun County, Alabama. The results of this survey showed an overwhelming need for more access to dental care, particularly among lower-income families eligible for Medicaid and ALLKids. To address this need, Dr. Sarrell worked with the Calhoun County Community Foundation to organize a dental clinic in Anniston, Alabama.Meehan, William A. \\"Town and Gown\\", The Jacksonville News. May 6, 2005. In 2005, Dr. Sarrell contacted Jeffrey A. Parker, the Executive in Residence at Jacksonville State University, and asked him to help the struggling clinic. Upon Mr. Parker's arrival, the clinic became independent of the foundation and changed its name to The Sarrell Regional Dental Center for Public Health. Growth and expansion Sarrell quickly began to experience growth, and by the end of 2005, Sarrell had opened additional offices in Heflin and Talladega.Ruple, Wayne. \\"Grand Opening of Dental Center Sept. 7\\" The Cleburne News. September 1, 2005. In December 2006, the Heflin office began offering optometry services in addition to dental care. Sarrell then partnered with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to open the UAB Sarrell Dental Center in Bessemer, Alabama. In early 2007, Sarrell converted a bus into a fully operational mobile dental clinic. New fixed clinics have since opened in Alexander City, Athens, Attalla, Boaz, Clanton, Dothan, Enterprise, Foley, Leesburg, Montgomery, Pinson, Selma, Toney and Tuscaloosa. Organizational Statistics In September 2013, Sarrell Dental became a member of the DentaQuest Healthcare Delivery Group. As of August 2015, the organization operated 17 fixed clinics, a mobile dental bus, and 4 eye offices in Alabama. Sarrell projects to see over 175,000 patient visits in 2015. Partnership with The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) In October 2007, Sarrell formed a partnership with The University of Alabama at Birmingham's School of Dentistry (UABSOD). The agreement called for the Dental School to send students to the Sarrell clinics for training and clinical practice in a 'teaching-hospital' situation, according to Dr. John Thornton, UAB's Associate Dean for Community Affairs.Edwards, Bill. \\"Cooperative Care\\", The Anniston Star. October 9, 2007. The clinic and dental school operated together for the next two and a half years, until late March 2010. It was then, Sarrell Chairman Jeff Parker told the Anniston Star, that he learned UAB would be ending the relationship due to \\"intense pressure from UAB alumni who have threatened to withdraw funding\\" from the dental school. According to the Star, \\"In an e-mail to a Star reporter Monday, Dale Turnbough, the associate vice president of public relations at UAB, wrote, \\"We believe Sarrell has a laudable mission and is doing a great job, and we are grateful for the partnership we have had to date. But our primary consideration has to be how to best prepare our students, and what is the best learning environment for them.\\" Fleming, John. \\"UAB School of Dentistry ends contract with local dental clinic\\", The Anniston Star. April 5, 2010. Jeff Parker, Chairman of Sarrell, and Brandi Parris, President of Sarrell, called it a culmination of an effort by some for-profit dentists to curtail Sarrell's operations statewide. Conflict and lawsuits with the Alabama Dental Association (ALDA) In March 2010, Sarrell Dental filed a slander lawsuit against Steve Mitchell, DMD, Director of UABSOD's Pediatric Dentistry. The claim was based on a transcript of an ALDA meeting in January where participants allegedly discussed ways to curb the success of Sarrell and other non-profits. Meeting participants, including Dr. Mitchell, complained about perceived \\"unfair\\" advantages for non-profits and discussed possible legislation to restrict their growth. In April, after UABSOD withdrew its students from the Sarrell clinics, Sarrell filed an additional lawsuit against ALDA for its \\"illegal conspiracy\\" to drive Sarrell out of business. Subsequently, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into whether ALDA had engaged in unfair competition or deceptive acts against Sarrell. In June 2011, after passage of House Bill 451 in the 2011 Alabama legislative session, Sarrell dropped all lawsuits as a goodwill gesture. PBS Frontline In the June 26, 2012 episode of PBS's Frontline series titled \\"Dollars and Dentists,\\" Frontline correspondent Miles O'Brien examined different models of dental services that were attempting to address the access to care issue faced by the majority of Medicaid recipients in America. Jeffrey Parker was interviewed to discuss how Sarrell Dental had become one of the few working models nationwide to see growing success. Parker offered the Sarrell Dental model as a replicable system that could offer a critical component to national oral healthcare reform, while also inviting other dentists to learn from their success: \\"Who can be against a model that is eliminating decay? ... they need to come see it, they need to adopt it, it works.\\" Awards and honors Sarrell has received several honors and awards, including: *NFL Alumni - Atlanta Chapter - Selected as an outstanding organization 2006‚Äìpresent *Alabama Head Start Association - Recipient of 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014 Alabama Head Start Corporate Award *National Children's Oral Health Foundation - Selected as a National Affiliate of the Year in 2010 *Best of Calhoun County - Recognized for 2011 Best Place to Work, Best Dentist and Best Eye Care * Web Marketing Association - Recipient of 2011 WebAward for Outstanding Achievement * Kentucky Dental Association - Sarrell CEO authors cover story in July/August 2012 newsletterParker, Jeffrey A., Thompson, John A. , KDA Today Newsletter. 2012. *HOLA Latino - Recipient of the 2013 Social Services Award *Robert Wood Johnson Foundation - Featured in a systematic report that assessed the Sarrell Dental model for innovative health care improvements in 2013 report\\"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Releases Systematic Report on Sarrell Dental\\".

Formed shortly after the Federation of Australia, the 5th Military District covered all of Western Australia except the Kimberley Region, with its headquarters in Perth. Following the First World War, the area's designation was changed to the 5th District Base. In October 1939, it was re-designated as Western Command when the Army moved towards a geographic command structure. In April 1942, the Army was reorganised and Western Command became III Corps in April 1942. Western Command was re-formed in June 1944 when the need for a corps-level headquarters passed. Then-Captain William Henderson, later promoted to Major General, served on the command's staff soon after the Second World War ended. The 13th Infantry Brigade was re-raised in 1948, once again headquartered in Western Australia, and assigned to Western Command. Upon formation, it consisted of two infantry battalions: the 11th/44th and the 16th/28th. In 1960, when the CMF was reorganised following the adoption of the Pentropic divisional establishment, the brigade was disbanded. The geographical command structure was retained until the 1970s.

Chaos terrain generally consists of irregular groups of large blocks, some tens of kilometers across and a hundred or more meters high. The tilted and flat topped blocks form depressions hundreds of metres deep. A chaotic region can be recognized by a rat's nest of mesas, buttes, and hills, chopped through with valleys which in places look almost patterned.Carr, M. 2006. The Surface of Mars. Cambridge University Press. Forget, F., et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing, Chichester, UK. Some parts of this chaotic area have not collapsed completely‚Äîthey are still formed into large mesas, so they may still contain water ice.http://themis.asu.edu/features/aramchaos Chaos regions formed long ago. By counting craters (more craters in any given area means an older surface) and by studying the valleys' relations with other geological features, scientists have concluded the channels formed 2.0 to 3.8 billion years ago.http://themis.asu.edu/feature/51 Locations The greatest concentrations of chaotic terrain are in the same locations as giant, ancient river valleys. Because so many large channels seem to originate from chaotic terrain, it is widely believed that chaos terrain is caused by water coming out the ground in the form of massive floods.Carr, M. 1978. Formation of martian flood features by release of water from confined aquifers. NASA Technical Memorandum 79729. 260-262. Most of the chaotic terrain exists in the highlands of Mars, south of Chryse Planitia, in the Oxia Palus quadrangle, and along the Martian dichotomy. But some chaos regions can be found in Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle, Phaethontis quadrangle, and Lunae Palus quadrangle. Mapbeer.jpgMap showing location of Arsinoes Chaos (far left), Iani Chaos, Aureum Chaos, Margaritifer Chaos, and other nearby features Theories for formation Many different theories have been advanced for how floods of water came to be released with the formation of chaotic terrain. Evidence for the involvement of water has been found‚Äîminerals associated with water, such as grey, crystalline hematite and phyllosilicates, are present in chaos regions. Many explanations for the creation of chaos involve the sudden melting of giant reservoirs of ground ice. Some researchers have suggested that a frozen layer, called a cryosphere, developed over a long time period and then something triggered it to rupture and melt suddenly. The rupturing event may have been impacts, magma movements,Head, J. and L. Wilson. 2002. Mars: A review and synthesis of general environments and geological settings of Magma-H2O interactions. In: SmeilieJ. And M. Chapman. (EDS.). Volcanic-ice Interactions on Earth and Mars. Geological Society. London seismic activity, volcanic tectonic strains, increased pore pressure, or the dissociation of clathrates.Komatsu, G. et al. 2000. A chaotic terrain formation hypothesis: Explosive outgas and outflow by dissociation of clathrate on Mars. Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXI. 1434. A clathrate composed of carbon dioxide and methane could have explosively dissociated, thereby liquefying water-saturated sediments. A variation of this idea of a cryosphere is that an aquifer was created along with the cryosphere. As more and more ice was added resulting in a thicker cryosphere, the water in the aquifer became pressurized. When something like an impact or movement of magma broke or melted the cryosphere, floods of water under great pressure were released. However, further calculations showed that the great channels could not have been produced with just a single discharge. Later proposals advanced the notion that the geological shapes present in chaos regions could have been made by a series of over 100 flooding events. =Melting of buried ice= More recently, researchers have suggested ways for the formation of chaos without the need for a special triggering event. Tanja Zegers and others calculated that the simple burial of ice-rich sediments could result in the release of huge amounts of water leading to the formation of the large river basins that are associated with most chaos terrains. The group studied Aram Chaos, a large region of chaos that probably began as a large impact crater. In their model, ice-rich material accumulated in the crater and then became covered with sediment, which prevented the ice from disappearing into the thin atmosphere. Eventually, the heat from the deep subsurface together with the insulating qualities of the covering layer produced a thick water layer. Since dense materials tend to sink into water, the overlying rock broke under the strain. The dense, rocky cap fractured into various sized, tilted blocks. The melt water went to the top and made a channel which eroded more and more as water rushed outward. Along with water from other chaotic regions, there would have been enough erosive force to carve the large river valleys we now observe. There is ample evidence for buried deposits of ice in the form of glaciers, preserved under a thin covering of rock and dirt.

On Earth the ridge would be called the terminal moraine of an alpine glacier. Picture taken with HiRISE under the HiWish program. Image from Ismenius Lacus quadrangle. It also seems that Mars has had many ice ages in which ice was deposited, then later buried. These ice ages are caused by the frequent large changes in the tilt of the planet. The tilt of the spin axis of Mars is highly variable due to the lack of a large moon.Madeleine, J. et al. 2007. Mars: A proposed climatic scenario for northern mid-latitude glaciation. Lunar Planet. Sci. 38. Abstract 1778. Observations of many craters have shown that many craters are mostly full of sediments‚Äîice could be one of the sediments. Many craters appear to be very shallow, but observations of younger craters have demonstrated that impact craters start out as sort of bowl shaped; hence a crater that today looks shallow has probably been filled with sediments. Research, published by Rodriguez and others in 2005, suggested that the subsurface of Mars contains an accumulation of old craters that may be filled with water or ice. Image:Exhumed crater in Noachis.JPGCrater that was buried in another age and is now being exposed by erosion, as seen by the Mars Global Surveyor. This is evidence that there may be many buried craters in the subsurface of Mars. Image:Hollows as seen by hirise under hiwish program.jpgWell-developed hollows, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program. Hollows are on floor of a crater with concentric crater fill. The hollows develop because of movements of ice-rich sediment. There may be hundreds of metres of ice covered by a thin layer of sediments. Location is Casius quadrangle. =Sublimation of an ice-rich layer= Some regions of chaos may have been produced by another means. Galaxias Chaos is different from many other chaotic regions. It does not have associated outflow channels, and it does not display a great elevation difference between it and the surrounding land area, as most of the other chaos regions. Research by Pedersen and Head, published in 2010, suggests that Galaxias Chaos is the site of a volcanic flow that buried an ice-rich layer, called the Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF).Pedersen, G., J. Head. 2010. Chaos formation by sublimation of volatile-rich substrate: Evidence from Galaxias Chaos, Mars. Icarus: 211, 316‚Äì329. It is generally believed that the VBF is a residue from water-rich materials deposited by large floods. The VBF may have been of varied thickness and may have contained varied amounts of ice. In the thin atmosphere of Mars, this layer would have slowly disappeared by sublimation (changing from a solid directly to a gas). Since some areas would have sublimated more than others, the upper lava cap would not be supported evenly and would crack. Cracks/troughs may have begun from sublimation and shrinkage along the edges of the lava cap. Stress from the undermining of the cap edge would have made cracks in the cap. Places with cracks would undergo more sublimation, then the cracks would widen and form the blocky terrain characteristic of regions of chaos. The sublimation process may have been aided by heat (geothermal flux) from magma movements. There are volcanoes, namely Elysium Montes and Hecates Tholus, nearby which most likely are surrounded by dikes, which would have heated the ground. Also, a warmer period in the past would have increased the amount of water sublimating from the ground. Image:Galaxiascomplete2.jpgThis series of drawings show another model for the formation of Martian chaos, as proposed by Pedersen and Head 2011 Amount of sublimation is exaggerated to improve understanding.

Image:Galaxiaschaoshirist.jpgGalaxias Chaos as seen by HiRISE. Importance Chaos terrain seems to be strong evidence for large amounts of water flowing on Mars in the past. Some of the terrain is not totally broken up, so perhaps more water exists frozen inside some of the blocks.

It started on March 10, 1982 at an office in Yogyakarta. Primagama gives extra education for students from elementary and high school to gain academic success. Primagama has 766 branches, 400 business partners and more than 20000 staff. Awards include ISO certificate 1998, Superbrand, Marketing Award, Franchise Award, and Top Brand for Kid. History Primagama was preceded by Purdi E. Chandra‚Äôs boredom of campus life. He had studied in four Majors - Psychology, Electrical, English Literature and Pharmacy in Gadjah Mada University and IKIP Yogya. He decided to end his university days and start Primagama test tutoring, which later turned into Primagama learning tutor institution. The place which was first used was a rented room. Only two students attended the first class. The institution has 766 branches throughout Indonesia. Almost every year, approximately 300,000 students join Primagama. Primagama is confirmed as Indonesia‚Äô largest tutoring organisation by MURI (the Indonesian Record Museum). Primagama is also a holding company which has 20 subsidiaries in formal education, non-formal education, telecommunications, travel agents, restaurants, supermarkets, insurance, and golf courses. Through the franchising concept, they have hundreds of branches in Indonesia. Primagama uses a learning method named SMART Solution. SMART solution is a collection of tricks and formulas developed by Primagama to solve questions. With SMART, students can answer questions that relate to numbers and formula. These questions usually are the most difficult questions that students deal with. Another Primagama concept is REC (Remedial Enrichment and Consulting). Remedial means Primagama will give their students additional lessons to enhance the students comprehension. Enrichment means that Primagama will give enrichments questions like daily exams or national exams. Consulting means that teachers in Primagama will listens student‚Äôs problems. Students are able to study in their home with selftutoring program software and building games through PrimagamaPlus, which is an extension of their program. DMI Test is a fingerprint test that some believe allows the tester to identify the tested person‚Äôs talent, characteristics and other things. Teguh Sunaryo, Director of DMI Primagama Indonesia, said ‚ÄúThis developed method by Primagama is not a forecast. This is an attempt to discover someone‚Äôs self-potential map. The method can be applied in various backgrounds, ranging from preschool students, such as playgroup and kindergarten, elementary school, junior high and high school to students, teachers, professors, politicians and publics‚Äù. All Primagama services can't be found in all Primagama branches. Due to the franchising system, branches vary in their capabilities. Plus, having complete facilities means a lot of funding and not every branches can afford this. In countryside areas, sometimes only class tutoring is available. Channels The two channels to Primsagama are their website, and their offices which spread across the nation. To get complete information, students are advised to go to their office, so they can ask about the fee and the installment, because such information is not shown in their website. Key activities and key partners Other than class teaching and private teaching, to expand its market franchising is an option Primagama also uses. For advertising, Primagama is partnering with companies from different sectors in Indonesia for a co-branding program. Revenue streams and cost structure The revenue stream is obtained from subscription fees. Every student pays some amount before the class starts but now Primagama allow students to pay the fees in installments. Primagama have held some free learning events for schools, and a collaboration program between Primagama and Microsoft, with a website that provides a free try out for national examinations.

They also established Supercanal Holding AS, now valued at more than $800 million. Grupo Uno acquired the Buenos Aires-based TV channel Am√©rica 2, in partnership with the politician and businessman Francisco de Narvaez.

The operation was carried out with Mercuria, the holding company owner of El Tr√©bol.

He created Grupo Vitivin√≠cola de Tupungato, which operates Los Algarrobos estate in San Juan, and vineyards and a winery in Tupungato, Mendoza.Jos√© Luis Manzano se qued√≥ con una finca de Suter en MendozaBodega Altus The winery owns 1,533 hectares of fields which are located around 1,200‚Äì1,500 meters above sea level. Thirty hectares are taken up by vineyards, which produce raw materials for the wines that are sold in domestic and foreign markets. The winery has an output capacity of 1 million liters of wine per year. In the same building as the winery is a restaurant known as La Tupi√±a in Gualtallary, owned by the Viticulture Group of Tupungato.La Tupi√±a en Gualtallary Political activities Manzano was active in Argentinian politics during the 1980s and 90s. He was a founder and an active member of the Peronist (\\"La Renovaci√≥n Peronista\\") political party. When democracy returned to Argentina, the party was defeated at the ballot box, after which Manzano helped consolidate and strengthen the party. One source describes him as \\"the symbol of the late-80s renewal of Peronism.\\" In 1983 he was the Argentine national deputy. As a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the nation, he participated in the approval of the legislative bill on the modification of the civil marriage regime, being one of the main speakers of the discussion sessions prior to the final sanction of Law 23,515 (Divorce Law) in 1987.C√°mara de Diputados de la Naci√≥n. 27 Reuni√≥n- Continuaci√≥n de la 7 Sesi√≥n Ordinaria (especial), p. 3770 y 3771. His defense of the possibility of marrying after separation and of individual liberties was documented in a speech he gave on August 19, 1986, where he affirmed his belief in the importance of responsible liberty: > \\"We want adult liberty, responsible freedom for the Argentines, and that > those who want to re-bet on love and family, instead of having the > comfortable situation of separation without assuming responsibilities, to > assume together with Argentine society these two issues, that we do not > understand separated because in the justicialismo we learned to live them > together: freedom and responsibility (...) When we speak of liberation, we > are referring to the fact that as a nation and as a people each of us has to > opt for more things every day, that every day he must make the renunciation > that he must make to his individual freedom in order to build together > collective freedom. He also referred to the importance of consensus for the > country. \\"When they say that it is not possible, we will say that it can. > And that day, when we finish learning the lesson that the motor is the > consensus, what better is to close the ears to the lobbyists and open them > to the clearest voices of Argentine society ‚Äì those who come from the > people, the only legitimate source ‚Äì we can together rediscover many things > (...) And then we can rediscover together that dreaming is not crazy and > that dreams are possible.\\" In 1991, as Minister of the Interior and leader of the federal security forces, he played a key role in investigating the abduction of the businessman Mauricio Macri.https://www.clarin.com/politica/manzano-robo-corona-empresario- kirchnerismo_0_SJjf5PxhPXg.html Manzano: del ‚ÄúRobo para la corona‚Äù a empresario aliado del kirchnerismohttps://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/encerrado-ataud-macri- cambio-siempre_0_HykTvSb_.html Encerrado en un ata√∫d, la vida cambi√≥ para siempre In 2008 Manzano was honored in Argentina's parliament (the National Congress of Argentina) along with other former members for helping to reconstruct Argentina's returning democracy.https://www.clarin.com/ediciones- anteriores/haran-homenaje-camara-diputados-1983_0_SkIXW2oCaKg.html Har√°n un homenaje a la C√°mara de Diputados de 1983 =United States= From 1993 to 1995 Manzano lived in California where he began to develop his career in the private sector acting as an international consultant. He lived in Washington, D.C in 1994 where he joined the Republican Party. In 1995, he studied English and American domestic policy at the University of San Diego, and created a consulting firm called Integra Investments S.A., where he serves as the company's president. Integra Investments has offices in Washington, Miami, Buenos Aires and Mendoza. In late 1995, after spending two years away from Argentina, he returned home with plans of pursuing a business career. Allegations The Vila-Manzano media group, and its principals, have been repeatedly accused of alleged fraud, censorship of TV programmes, money laundering, unfair dismissal, wire tapping, and tax evasion. There is no evidence that those accusations have been corroborated, proven, or have moved forward in any meaningful way. In 2000, for example, Orlando Vignatti, a holding member of La Capital Multimedios, sued Manzano and Vila, alleging that they committed fraud and conspiracy in a deal involving shares of several radio stations and the newspaper La Capital de Rosario. Vila said that Vignatti was not happy with his 25 percent interest ownership in the company that Vila and Manzano had given him through a contract, but Vila said that \\"we showed him that it was fair, he even asked to be general manager and we granted it\\" (translated from Spanish). After Vignatti filed the lawsuit, another meeting between the parties was agreed to, but Vignatti did not attend \\"for personal reasons,\\" according to the Argentinian newspaper P√°gina/12. Among the documentation presented as evidence, Vignatti submitted a fax that Vila allegedly sent him from the newspaper La Capital. \\"I never sent a fax like that!\\" Vila responded when asked by a reporter. The next year, Carlos Mar√≠a Lagos, the former owner of the newspaper, filed a complaint in which he alleged that Manzano and Vila \\"depleted\\" the company's funds. Santa Fe Justice investigated a \\"possible emptying of the firm\\" (translated from Spanish), according to the Los Andes Argentinian news website. In response, Vila told Los Andes that \\"everyone who has a commercial claim, uses [the] criminal justice [system] extortively and then [runs] a smear campaign through the media . . . such as Clar√≠n, La Naci√≥n and The Andes.\\" According to Los Andes, the dispute between Lagos and Vila-Manzano is centered around how shares of the company were distributed and disputes about company expenses. (In 1997, Lagos sold 75 percent of the shares of La Capital newspaper to Vila and Manzano's Grupo Uno media company, making Vila and Manzano the majority shareholders and controlling owners). Both Vignatti and Lagos had their own issues with the justice system, when Vignatti's properties were attached in 2016http://viarosario.viapais.com.ar/sociedad/embargaron-al-empresario- rosarino-orlando-vignatti-el-ciudadano-la-capital?rc=1&qt- notas;_tabs_multimedia=0 Embargaron al empresario rosarino Orlando Vignatti and when Lagos was investigated for his management of La Capital.http://archivo.lacapital.com.ar/2001/06/10/articulo_21.html Investigar√°n a Carlos Mar√≠a Lagos por su gesti√≥n al frente de La Capital In 2001, Bernardo Mart√≠n Rutti, a former associate of Manzano and Vila, reported the two men to the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (AFIP). Rutti alleged that they laundered more than $400 million that Manzano, Rutti alleged, had \\"illegally obtained\\" during his time in public service. Rutti attempted to attribute what he called ‚Äúthe prodigious growth of the Vila- Manzano group‚Äù to his own unproven allegations of wrongdoing regarding the \\"true ownership\\" of, and source of the funds for, some of the Vila-Manzano companies. Rutti's main argument was the subjective unsubstantiated claim that the Vila-Manzano group \\"had a rapid and unjustified economic growth\\" by buying large amount of cables in the interior of the country, with an investment of the order of 300 million provided by Manzano.\\" (Rutti used to work for Vila and Manzano but his employment had been terminated.) =Links to Kirchners and others= An opinion article published in August 2012 in La Naci√≥n described Manzano, according to the viewpoint of the opinion article author Joseph Crettaz, as an \\"old political friend of current officials, legislators and judges\\" who, despite his \\"low public profile,\\" is very actively involved with the powers that be. For instance, the relationship of Grupo Uno with the banker Ra√∫l Moneta was mentioned in an opinion article with no byline. The opinion article (published in March 2001 in La Naci√≥n) about the ‚Äúscandals‚Äù surrounding Moneta's ‚Äúdubious‚Äù banking group noted Moneta's business relationship to Manzano, while adding that it is ‚Äúdifficult to determine‚Äù precisely what the nature of that relationship is. An article in Perfil, an Argentine tabloid newspaper, said that Horacio Verbitsky (an Argentine left- wing investigative journalist for P√°gina/12 and author with a past history as a leftist guerrilla), in one of his articles in P√°gina/12, mentioned Manzano's \\"very close connections to the Casa Rosada\\" during the administrations of the late Argentine president N√©stor Kirchner and the former president, Cristina F√©rnandez Kirchner. The La Naci√≥n newspaper, which was in a strong dispute with the former government, identified as Manzano's ‚Äúconcrete achievements‚Äù under both presidencies his ability to secure cable television licenses beyond the legal limits, the government's pardoning of his tax debts, his obtaining of government advertising on the media he owns, and a privileged position in regard to obtaining a mobile-phone concession. =Cablevision raid and aftermath= In 2004 in Argentina, the largest media companies were Cablevisi√≥n (owned by Grupo Clar√≠n), Multicanal (owned by Grupo Vila-Manzano), and Supercanal, which was jointly owned by Vila-Manzano (80%) and Clar√≠n (20%). Vila-Manzano later sold Multicanal to a joint-venture between Clar√≠n and Fintech, a U.S. investment fund. During the Nestor Kirchner administration, Multicanal and Cablevisi√≥n merged under the ownership of Grupo Clar√≠n. In 2011, Grupo Vila-Manzano filed a complaint with a court in Mendoza Province that alleged \\"anticompetitive\\" practices by Cablevisi√≥n, which was owned by Grupo Clar√≠n, a media conglomerate. In response to the complaint, Mendoza judge Walter Bento ordered the breakup of Cablevisi√≥n and Multicanal and appointed a judicial co-administrator to oversee the division of the two companies. On December 23, 2011, Cablevisi√≥n pressed charges against Bento with the Judiciary Council, calling for his impeachment. In 2012, the Federal Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Federal Capital (La C√°mara Civil y Comercial Federal de la Capital Federal) ruled against Judge Bento's order, thus terminating the intervention into Cablevisi√≥n that began in 2011. Some Argentinian media published news articles opposing Vila-Manzano's position and supporting Grupo Clar√≠n's position in the dispute. For example: * A Clarin article wrote that a Manzano security escort and a \\"computer spy\\" were allegedly among the officials who entered Cablevisi√≥n after Judge Bento's ruling. * Another Clarin article alleged that Vila-Manzano tried to \\"exert pressure\\" and contacted former President Kirchner to press their case. * The website \\"1seprin.com\\" alleged that Judge Bento worked for a Vila-Manzano foundation.http://1seprin.com/2012/08/15/el-juez-que-allano-cablevision-fue- empleado-de-vila-y-manzano-hasta-el-2008/ * Another Clarin article alleged that a Kirchner friend had helped persuade Bento to issue his order.  Social responsibility  Jos√© Luis Manzano contributes to social, cultural and educational causes. He works with the Vendimia Solidaria program,http://noticias.perfil.com/2016/03/05/vila-pamela-david-y-manzano- celebran-la-vendimia-en-mendoza/ Vila Pamela David y Manzano celebran la vendimia en Mendoza which works toward the development of children and adolescents in the Province of Mendozahttp://vendimiasolidaria.org.ar/mision_objetivos/ Vendimia solidaria by providing financial assistance and promoting actions for the benefit of hospitals, neighborhood sports clubs and schools.

In 2010, the Kazakhstanis also took part in the FIBA Asia Champions Cup, having participated in 2007 whilst turning down the invitation in 2008. They reached the quarterfinals, winning their final two games to finish a team record 5th. Their winning streak in the Championship was ended during the 2010‚Äì11 season as they lost in the semifinals to perennial runners- up Tobol Kostanay.

The primary lines of business include retail banking, deposit-taking and lending. Established in 1982, by June 2020, the credit union had over 31,300 members and 3,600 junior members.  History  The Credit Union was originally established for a London-based local authority staff in 1982, (known as Southwark Council Employees Credit Union) by a small group of volunteers. It was formed to address the economic hardship among low paid manual workers and the local Caribbean community. Like other British credit unions at the time, it was a small savings and loans co-operative which offered its members a limited range of financial products and services. Despite being the first credit union in the UK to operate a payroll deduction scheme, Southwark Council Employees Credit Union only recruited between 200 and 300 members from a workforce of over 12,000 in the first nine years of its existence. From 1991 onwards, Southwark Council Employees Credit Union implemented a range of reforms, including the introduction of improved IT systems and staff development. In 1997, it opened membership to employees of King's College Hospital, under the name Southwark and Kings Employees Credit Union and, in 1999, as Southwark Credit Union, to anyone living or working in the borough. Southwark Credit Union was among the first British credit unions to adopt the PEARLS financial monitoring system, which increased financial discipline, maximised savings and which lead to the introduction of risk based lending. As part of a drive to develop products and services to meet people's needs, in 2006, the credit union was the first in the UK to offer current accounts, alongside benefit direct accounts, flexible savings accounts, instant and accessible loans. In 2006, Southwark Credit Union became the first credit union to deliver Financial Inclusion Growth Fund loans through a contract with the Department for Work and Pensions. = Mergers = Throughout its early years, the credit union absorbed a number of smaller credit unions in Southwark. The first of these, in 1997, was Camberwell Health Authority Credit Union (established in 1991), followed, in 2001, by the Camberwell Credit Union (established 1980). In 2010, members of Lambeth Savings and Credit Union (established 2006) voted to transfer engagements to Southwark Credit Union, which adopted the present name, extending its common bond to take in the London Borough of Lambeth. In 2012, LMCU absorbed the Pimlico Credit Union (established 1980), enlarging its south London base to the City of Westminster. Most recently, in 2013, it absorbed Camden Plus Credit Union (established 2006), expanding its area of operation to include London Borough of Camden  Products  In 2012, London Mutual Credit Union became the first British credit union to offer payday loans. The initial 12 months trial for short-term payday loans was completed in 2013. The scheme was funded by the Friends Provident Foundation and the Barclays Community Finance Fund, with project support from the Financial Inclusion Centre. The pilot payday loan received 6,087 applications for an average loan of ¬£238. In the 12-month pilot, 2,923 short-term loans with a value of ¬£687,757 were provided to 1,219 different borrowers. Under the scheme, borrowers could take out a payday loan or spread out repayment over a longer period. 29% of applicants repaid their loan in one month, while 59% of applicants opted to repay their loan over three months. However, in a survey, 66% of applicants said their main reason for taking out a loan with London Mutual was the low cost of borrowing compared to other payday lenders. Only 10% said that the option to repay over a longer period of time was their main reason for choosing the credit union. According to LMCU, the payday loan pilot saved 1,219 borrowers collectively saved ¬£145,000, or ¬£119 each, compared to borrowing from a high-cost payday lender. The credit union developed its payday and short-term loan products in response to increased use of payday lenders in the London boroughs it serves. Following the completion of the pilot London Mutual Credit Union made its payday loan facility available to anyone living or working in the London boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, City of Westminster and Camden. Like high-cost payday lenders the credit union allows borrowers to take out a CUOK payday loan online. = Regulation = Registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, London Mutual Credit Union is a member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited.Credit unions in membership of ABCUL Association of British Credit Unions (retrieved 1 November 2014) As a financial institution, it is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and PRA, who also regulate banks, building societies and insurance companies.

He also held cabinet-level posts three times.  Biography  Ino was born in Nihonbashi-ku, a former administration division of Tokyo that is now part of Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo, and was educated at the Kaisei Academy, following which he graduated from Tokyo Imperial University. He was hired as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, eventually hiring to become director of the sericulture bureau. With the establishment of the Kikakuin in 1937, Ino became vice-chairman in charge of irrigation. In June 1941, he joined the cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry under the 2nd Konoe administration. He concurrently held the portfolio of Minister of Colonial Affairs, until that post was abolished under the T≈çj≈ç administration in 1942. In the 1942 General Election, Ino was elected to the Lower House as a representative from Mie Prefecture, with the backing of the Taisei Yokusankai political party. However, Ino was later chairman of the Gokoku D≈çshikai, a political group founded in March 1945 with the aim of toppling T≈çj≈ç and one-party rule, and opening negotiations for an end to World War II. After the surrender of Japan, as with all other former government ministers, Ino was purged from public office and arrested by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers to stand trial for Class-A war crimes. He shared a cell in Sugamo Prison with Okinori Kaya, but his case never came to trial and he was released on parole. Following the end of occupation of Japan, Ino ran for public office again in the 1953 General Election with the support of the Liberal Party and was elected to a seat in the House of Councillors of the post-war Diet of Japan, from Mie Prefecture. He was subsequently re- elected twice from the same district under the Liberal-Democratic Party ticket. Ino was a member of the faction led by Nobusuke Kishi. In 1959, after Kishi became Prime Minister of Japan he was to accept the position of Minister of Justice in his second cabinet. In 1965, Ino was awarded the 1st class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures and in 1973 he was awarded the 1st class of the Order of the Rising Sun. Ino published his memoirs in 1978. Ino died in 1980.

The old Waterford jail had been built in 1727 alongside the military barracks in the city. The building was rebuilt in 1861 and continued to be used as a prison until 1939 at the beginning of the Emergency as World War II was officially known in neutral Ireland. The following year the building was taken over by the Irish army and used as a meeting place and storage depot for the Local Defence Forces, a wartime reserve force.http://www.waterfordtreasures.com/news/bite-size-culture-talks- ballybricken-jail-and-the-jail-wall-disaster# On the night of the wall collapse, there had been heavy rain and a weak wall filled with water became porous at its foundations from disuse. At approximately 12:45am on the morning of March 4th, the sixty-foot high wall gave way and collapsed onto the adjacent houses of King's Terrace and part of Barker Street killing and injuring some of the occupants as they slept. A section of more than a hundred feet of wall fell in total demolishing four houses and damaging a further three. The storage of turf by the army had contributed to the problem of dampness that caused the walls to become porous. It is further believed that additional pressure had been placed on the old jail wall by rain-sodden turf which was being stored in the premises by the army for heating purposes due to the shortage of imported coal. Crowds assisted local emergency services in removing the heavy rubble, but there was nothing they could do, and nine bodies were pulled from the jail ruins, including a number of children, the youngest being two years old. Those who lost their lives in the Jail Wall tragedy were: James Roche (age 60 years), Thomas Roche (age 55 years), Maureen Roche (age 20 years), James (Seamus) Roche (age 6 years), James Barrett (age 11 years), Kitty Barrett (age 9 years), Joseph Upton (age 60 years), Patrick Upton (age 15 years), and Betty Steward (age 2 years). Seventeen people were injured.http://www.munster-express.ie/local-news/st-johns-parish/ The subsequent funerals were among the largest ever seen in Waterford City. Many hundreds attended the funerals over the following days as the city descended into a period of mourning with shops closing and blinds being drawn. Huge crowds of mourners lined the street as bands played the Dead March in Saul by Handel. The jail was eventually demolished in 1949.http://www.waterfordtreasures.com/news/bite-size-culture-talks- ballybricken-jail-and-the-jail-wall-disaster# Over sixty years later, a special memorial has been unveiled by Waterford City Council.

It has been organised by the Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) of the European Commission since 2007, with a key aim to promote language learning in schools and give young people a taste of what it is like to be a translator. Each year over 3000 students take part in the contest. The contest has inspired and encouraged some of the participants to pursue language courses at university level and to become professional translators. Throughout the years, interest from schools has grown, confirming the success of this initiative to promote language learning at secondary education level. Multilingualism, and therefore translation, have been an integral part and richness of the EU since its beginnings.  Objectives  Juvenes Translatores contest aims at: * promoting language learning at school * promoting multilingualism * promoting the understanding of and openness towards other cultures * promoting the translation career * promoting the value and benefits of translation in business  Basic rules  All 17-year old students from secondary schools based in the European Union and recognized by their public authorities can take part in the Juvenes Translatores contest. A participating school should ensure suitable facilities and IT equipment, provide staff as well as ensure fair and impartial conditions throughout the whole process of the contest. As there are more schools willing to take part in the contest than can be accommodated each round, a random selection of participating schools takes place. The number of selected schools per country is equal to the number of seats that each country has in the European Parliament. When selected schools are announced on the official website, they can register between 2 and 5 students to participate in the contest. The contest is held simultaneously in all selected schools across the EU in late November. On contest day, participants have 2 hours to translate a one-page text online. They can choose to translate from any of 24 EU official languages, and into any of the 24 EU official languages, which offers a possible choice of 552 language pairs! Students should decide on their preferred language pair prior to the contest day. The use of online dictionaries, spell checker, computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools, as well as machine translation are not allowed. Only paper dictionaries can be used as a support. The organisers and DGT translators, assess all translations which are anonymously submitted via the online platform on which the contest takes place. The main criteria to select the winning translation for each EU country are: accuracy, grammar, punctuation, creativity and fluency. The contest culminates in the Award ceremony in Brussels.

There are several witnesses, the main one being Mrs. Salmon, who glimpsed Mr. Adams' face after seeing him on the steps of Mrs. Parker's house hiding a hammer. At the trial, Mrs. Salmon presents her account firmly and honestly, and is confident that the heavy man in the dock is Mr. Adams. However, she becomes flustered when the man's counsel presents to her an identical-looking man at the back of the courtroom, who is revealed to be his twin brother. None of the other witnesses can swear that the Adams twin in the dock is the Adams they had seen on the night of the murder, and both twins have alibis, that each was with his wife at the time. The twin in the dock is thus acquitted for lack of evidence. Then, as the twins are leaving the courtroom, a freak accident sees one of them pushed in front of a bus and killed, thus deepening the mystery of the \\"Peckham Murder\\".

The Forum for New European Photography  Each year at the last weekend of January, Plat(t)form, the Forum for New European Photography, takes place in the Fotomuseum Winterthur. This is an extraordinary opportunity for forty-two \\"emerging artists‚Äù each year to introduce themselves to the public and to a team of experts. Young, new, complex visual worlds are presented and publicly discussed. The standard of the young photographers is exceptionally high thanks to a double jury process (nomination and selection). For the photographers and experts, but also for curators, publishers, collectors, gallerists, and the public, this weekend is an exciting visual experience with engaging discussions and intensive networking. The Plat(t)form Databank is a unique online opportunity to learn more about recent European photography.

He was also on the field during an October 6, 1923 game between Iowa State and University of Minnesota. It was during that game that Trice received several injuries that led to his death two days later. Roberts also played in a one professional game, under an alias, while still a student at Iowa State. Following the end of the Cyclones 1924 season, he and two other players were asked to play a post-season game for which they would be paid. During the game, the Iowa State players realized that some of their opponents were from the University of Iowa. Roberts later stated that he still had one year of eligibility on the men's basketball team and was fearful of being caught. Roberts played four years at Iowa State, but did not graduate.

WorldCat item record He is also the author of fourteen articles and chapters, primarily on educational administration and his philosophical interests, which include ethics, cognitive science, and metaphysics. Educational issues Following conflict in 2005-2006 that took place between the Alfred State College campus president Uma Gupta and the employees that attracted national coverage in the New York Times, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and other venues, Barwick identified the event as the first time that social media criticism had contributed substantially to the reassignment of a public college president, publishing positively reviewed analyses in national and international publications.http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1074-8121&volume;=15&issue;=1&articleid;=1593256&show;=pdf Barwick is a proponent of the view that a negative link between large class size, generically understood, and reduced learning outcomes has not been proven to exist in higher education, and has argued that additional funding for research is needed. An early advocate for the Mooc, he has argued that although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes, there is not sufficient experimentation with different instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always correlated with poorer outcomes. In 2013, Independence Community College became the first public college in Kansas to allow the concealed carry of handguns.http://www.gctelegram.com/b0a59959-531d-5fd4-bad0-4905b5682e1c.html As more states require public colleges to allow concealed carry, Barwick now speaks widely on the data gathered during the lengthy period since the rule was enacted, the process used to construct his campus' policy, and the insurance options for schools who choose to allow concealed carry. In 2016, Barwick was one of eight presidents who threatened to leave the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference over concerns regarding football roster limitations. Barwick and the seven other presidents argued that the roster limitations were originally based on racial discrimination, and continued to have a discriminatory effect. The conference subsequently voted unanimously to eliminate the restrictions.http://www.kansas.com/sports/article109538887.html  References  Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from New York (state) Category:People from Independence, Kansas Category:People from Utica, New York Category:State University of New York at Geneseo alumni Category:State University of New York faculty Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:University of Iowa alumni ","title":"Daniel Barwick"},{"id":"33229771","text":"Ben Aronson (born October 4, 1958) is an American painter living in Massachusetts. His work is represented by Tibor de Nagy GalleryTibor de Nagy Gallery in New York, Jenkins Johnson GalleryJenkins Johnson Gallery in San Francisco, and Alpha GalleryAlpha Gallery in Boston. One of the strongest urban scene painters working today, Aronson's painterly urban landscapes combine precise realism with gestural immediacy and Abstract Expressionist energy. His work has become influential among, and emulated by many contemporary cityscape painters. His paintings are included in the permanent collections of more than fifty museums throughout the U.S. and abroad, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, MI, and the Suzhou Museum, Jiangsu Province, China, as well as numerous private and institutional collections. \\"Aronson's luscious impastos depict Manhattan's skyscrapers and concrete canyons, Paris's stately buildings, and San Francisco's skyline with great dexterity\\", winning acclaim as \\"...the real deal: the rich physicality of oil paint married to the mutable physics of perception\\". In recent years his cityscapes have evolved to include contemporary social realist themes \\"...in which Aronson moves the human figure from its lesser role within the larger urban landscape, into a full subject of its own. Echoing his dramatically lighted single object still lifes, the solitary figures have now taken their place on stage with equal poignancy.\\" (Images/Nighthawks Series) Exhibits at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, NYC (\\"Risk and Reward\\", 2010) and the Ogunquit Museum of American Art, Maine (\\"Aronson to Aronson\\", 2011) revealed a new emphasis on social realism in a series of paintings with Wall Street themes exploring the contemporary world of big business. His \\"... scenes of the New York Stock Exchange floor in particular reveal one of the most energized and sophisticated brushes in the country. His high-contrast tones, boldly thick paint and slashing marks perfectly mirror the fast-moving, high-powered and high-tech world.\\" Donald Kuspit, professor of art history and philosophy (Stony Brook University, Cornell) observes: \\"whatever social narrative is conveyed by Aronson's pictures, they are all exquisitely painted and emotionally haunting. Aronson is a social realist, like Edward Hopper‚Äîbut he's dealing with a different [our current] social reality\\".  Biography  Ben Aronson was born in Boston and grew up in Sudbury, Massachusetts. From early childhood he was immersed in the creative environment of his parents and their friends among professional artists, art dealers, writers, musicians, composers, and actors. He interned at a Boston architectural firm while in high school and considered pursuing architecture at Princeton and Yale. Ultimately deciding on fine art as his path of choice, he enrolled at the School of Fine Arts at Boston University where he earned his BFA and MFA in painting (1976‚Äì1982) studying under Philip Guston, James Weeks, David Aronson, Reed Kay, and John Wilson. Traveled to Europe in 1978 to study collections in Greece, Paris, the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy. Taught fine art at Beaver Country Day School, a private high school in Chestnut Hill, MA from 1983 to 1990. In 1990, he left teaching for work as an architectural illustrator which won him a prestigious international award from the American Society of Architectural Perspectivists in 1991. From 1995 to 2007 he was invited yearly to lecture and teach in a Drawing Seminar for architecture students at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. In the years since 1990 his work began to appear frequently in group and solo exhibitions at galleries in California, New York City, Chicago and New England. He has presented over 20 solo exhibitions at respected galleries across the U.S., including Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York (2005, 2008, 2010), Jenkins Johnson Gallery, San Francisco (2004, 2007, 2008, 2011), Alpha Gallery, Boston (2000, 2002, 2006, 2009). He was elected into the National Academy of Design in New York City in 2004. Aronson shares a family tradition in the arts. His father, David Aronson, is one of a major group of Boston painters known as the Boston Expressionists which includes Jack Levine, Hyman Bloom, and Karl Zerbe. David Aronson also founded the visual arts department at Boston University in 1955. His paintings and sculptures are represented in numerous major museum collections. His mother, Georgianna Nyman Aronson, is a respected American portrait painter who has produced official portraits of seven of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Ben Aronson‚Äôs two sons, Jesse (b. 1984) and Alex (b. 1987) are both pursuing successful careers in the visual arts. He lives with his wife, Eileen, at their home and studio in Massachusetts.

In these cityscapes, he contrasts blurry, impressionistic foregrounds with near-photorealistic distant views. The artist's figurative works are equally deft. In The Recollection (2008), the precise detailing of the fine restaurant in the background opposes the gauziness of the young blond woman whose blue eyes seem lost in reverie.\\"Images /Figure  Notes   References  *Feinstein, Lea, ARTnews/Summer 2007 *Grant, Daniel, American Artist, June 2006 *Kuspit, Donald, artnet Magazine, October 2010  External links  * http://www.artnet.com/artists/ben%2Daronson/ * http://www.benaronson.net (Personal Website) * https://web.archive.org/web/20111001024937/http://www.benaronson.net/painting- gallery/ (Images) Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:20th- century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st- century American painters Category:Figurative art Category:Artists from Boston Category:Painters from Massachusetts Category:Boston University College of Fine Arts alumni ","title":"Ben Aronson"},{"id":"33229776","text":"Lazarus () was Archbishop of Milan from 438 to 449 AD.

From 2014 he is a professor at the Poltava National Technical Yuriy Kondratyuk University., from 2017 he is a professor at the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute.  Scientific research and publishing  Biletskyy was the science editor of the Mining Encyclopedia (1998‚Äì2013), which contributed to creating a nationally unified mining terminological system in Ukraine. He has freely donated the contents of this multiple-volume set to Wikipedia, and has incorporated it into thousands of articles covering mining and technology subjects in Ukrainian Wikipedia. He has published over 450 academic papers, including more than 30 books (monographs, course books, dictionaries and encyclopedias). He is also the author of over 200 articles in popular science and science magazines. He is a founder and editor-in-chief of the national scientific and informational- analytical magazine Skhid (since 1995 an academic periodical on philosophy, history and economics); the founder and co-editor of the Donetsk Herald of Shevchenko Scientific Society. A regular contributor to the Ukrainian Wikipedia by 2015 Biletskyy had created more than 17,000 articles and more than 94,000 edits on Wikipedia. Biletskyy is the owner of 60 patents regarding various processing and transporting technologies in Ukraine and Russia.  Public activities  Originally a member of the Communist Party of Ukraine (1975‚Äì1990), Biletskyy later became one of the co-founders of the People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) in Donbas.–ö–æ–≤—Ç—É–Ω –í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä. –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –†—É—Ö—É –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏. ‚Äî –ö., 1995. ‚Äî 382 —Å.

The term was coined by Morin et al in 2008. It has been found that isomiR expression profiles can also exhibit race, population, and gender dependencies. There are four main variation types: *5' trimming‚Äîthe 5' dicing site is upstream or downstream from the reference miRNA sequence *3' trimming‚Äîthe 3' dicing site is upstream or downstream from the reference miRNA sequence *3' nucleotide addition‚Äînucleotides added to the 3' end of the reference miRNA *nucleotide substitution‚Äînucleotides changes from the miRNA precursor. It is thought that may be similar process than post-transcriptional modifications.  Discovery  miRBase is considered to be the gold-standard miRNA database‚Äîit stores miRNA sequences detected by thousand of experiments. In this database each miRNA is associated with a miRNA precursor and with one or two mature miRNA (-5p and -3p). In the past it had always been said that the same miRNA precursor generates the same miRNA sequences. However, the advent of deep sequencing has now allowed researchers to detect a huge variability in miRNA biogenesis, meaning that from the same miRNA precursor many different sequences can be generated potentially have different targets, or even lead to opposite changes in mRNA expression. Biogenesis The advent of sequencing has permitted scientists to elucidate a huge landscape of new miRNAs, to increase our knowledge of the biogenesis involved and to discover putative post-transcriptional editing processes in miRNAs ignored until now. These processes mostly generate variations of the current miRNAs that are annotated in miRBase in the 3' and 5' terminus and in minor frequencies, nucleotide substitution along the miRNA length,. The variations are mainly generated by a shift of Drosha and Dicer in the cleavage site, but also by nucleotide additions at the 3'-end, resulting new sequences different from the annotated miRNA. These were named \\"isomiRs\\" by Morin et al., 2008. IsomiRs have been well established along different species in metazoa and deeply described for the first time in human stem cells and human brain samples. Moreover, it has been proven that isomiRs are not caused by RNA degradation during sample preparation for next generation sequencing. Some studies have tried to explain the miRNA diversity by structural bases of precursors but without clear results. The functionality of adenylation or uridynilation at the 3'end (3'addition isomiRs) has been related to alterations in the miRNA-3'-UTR stability. Furthermore, isomiRs have been detected deregulated in D. melanogaster development and differential expressed during Hippoglossus hippoglossus L. early development, suggesting a biologically relevant function. *Trimming variants: these are possible due to slight variations by Drosha and/or Dicer *Nucleotide addition: Wyman et al. have described the process of nucleotide transferases adding individual nucleotides to miRNA sequences *Nucleotide substitution: there is a huge range of possible changes in such an event, some of them can be explained by current Adenosine_deaminase like A to G or C to U, in a similar way to what happens in post- transcriptional RNA editing events involving mRNA.
