Phantograms use perspectival anamorphosis to produce a 2D image that is distorted in a particular way so as to appear, to a viewer at a particular vantage point, three-dimensional, standing above or recessed into a flat surface. The illusion of depth and perspective is heightened by stereoscopy techniques; a combination of two images, most typically but not necessarily an anaglyph (color filtered stereo image). With common (red‚Äìcyan) 3D glasses, the viewer's vision is segregated so that each eye sees a different image. Phantograms can be created using drawn images, photographs, or computer- generated images. Phantograms are usually placed horizontally and are intended to be viewed standing back from the image, though they can also be placed vertically and viewed at an angle from above or below. Principle The pair of images used to create a phantogram are anamorphic projections of a solid object onto a flat surface (using photographs of a real object, or drawings/computer-generated images). Phantograms work by presenting the viewer with a pair of flat images precisely distorted to mimic the anticipated perspective of a three-dimensional object viewed from the phantogram's intended vantage point. As with other forms of stereoscopy, the illusion reproduces many of the visual cues associated with binocular depth perception, fooling the viewer's vision into perceiving the two-dimensional images as having actual depth. The illusion is limited, however; phantograms lack some cues for depth perception such as convincing parallax, so the viewer must be stationary at the illusion's \\"sweet spot\\", a specific point at which the phantogram is designed to be most convincing. The anamorphic distortion of the source image crucial to the illusion can be understood by likening the images to projections of a 3D object onto a plane (e.g. a sheet of paper) originating from the location of the viewer's eyes. The base of the object meets the plane where the object stands, while the tip of the object is \\"projected\\" to a more distant point on the plane. Two projections, one for each eye, are made to produce a pair of images suitable for any dual-image form of stereoscopy (usually anaglyph imaging viewed through colored filter glasses). When the viewer is presented with flat images distorted in this way, the position of points on the image plane matches the points the actual object occupied, producing the illusion. History Phantograms are related to anamorphic trompe-l'≈ìil paintings that first appeared during the Renaissance, a famous example of which is Andrea Pozzo's fresco in Sant'Ignazio, featuring a flat area that appears to be a domed ceiling when viewed from the correct vantage point. Contemporary artists such as Kurt Wenner and Julian Beever use similar techniques to create chalk pavement art that appears to be three-dimensional. Similar effects are often seen on televised sporting events, where sponsor logos are painted onto the playing field or track, distorted so as to appear \\"upright\\" from the viewpoint of a particular TV camera. However, these examples do not employ any of the stereoscopy techniques that characterize phantograms. A patent for a technique that uses anaglyph and stereoscopic images was filed in 1926 by inventor Alfred John Macy (). This described rotation of an image with respect to a second, as required to present the illusion of depth from a particular vantage point, and presented different images, but with no anamorphic process to correct proportions, to the viewer's left and right eyes using color filters. Early phantograms were hand-drawn, and examples can be found in mathematical and technical drawing texts from the early 20th century onwards. A book dedicated to the subject of hand-drawn phantograms, Constructing Anaglyph Images on Phantogram Perspective Charts, written by draftsman Raymond Nicyper, was published in 1979. More recently, phantograms created from photographs and computer-generated images have appeared, with photo manipulation computer software making the process of creating them easier and quicker. Numerous patents similar to Macy's 1926 application have been filed, refining the process and detailing different techniques and devices for creating phantograms (; ; ). Western and Aubrey registered trademarks for the images resulting from their processes; \\"Phantaglyph\\" and \\"Op-Up\\" respectively.

It crosses a major river, the Maumee, east of Napoleon. Most of the route is a rural two-lane highway and passes through both farmland and residential properties. The highway was first signed in 1930 on much the same alignment as today. SR 109 replaced the SR 65 designation, between SR 110 and the Michigan state line, that dates back to 1923. Some of the highway was paved in 1930, with the rest of the route being paved in 1939. Route description New Cleveland. SR 109 heads north concurrent with SR 15 and SR 65, in downtown Ottawa. The route heads through the north side of downtown Ottawa as a two-lane highway with a center turn lane, passing through a mix of residential and commercial properties. The concurrency curves northeast and has a traffic signal at the northern end of the SR 15 concurrency, SR 15 heads northwest and the other two routes continues northeast. The concurrency end when SR 109 turns due north and SR 65 continues northeast. The highway passes through residential and commercial as a two-lane highway, before leaving Ottawa. The route passes through farmland, with some houses, and curves northeast. The road curves back towards the north, before curving northwest, and having an intersection at SR 613\\\\. After the intersection with SR 613 the road crosses a Norfolk Southern Railroad track and makes a sharp turn due east. The highway heads east, before another sharp curve due north. The road enters Hamler from the south, passing through residential properties and has an at-grade crossing with CSX Railroad tracks. North of the tracks the road has an intersection with SR 18, this intersection is the southern end of the SR 18 concurrency. The concurrency leaves Hamler heading north through farmland, until SR 18 turns due west and SR 109 continues due north. SR 109 has an intersection with US 6, east of Napoleon. The highway crosses US 6 and continues north, until a T-intersection at SR 110\\\\. Both SR 109 and SR 110 head east parallel to the Maumee River. The concurrency passes under a railroad track owned by the Indiana and Ohio Railway. SR 109 leaves SR 110, heading north and crosses over the Maumee River. On the northside of the river the road enters woodland, before an intersection with Old US 24\\\\. SR 109 turns due west onto Old US 24, before turning due north again. The route passes farmland, with some woodland, and has an interchange with US 24. After the interchange at US 24, SR 109 enters Liberty Center and turns due east. After turning the east the route curves northwest and passes the central business distract area of the village. North of the business distract the highway crosses a railroad track and curves back due north. The highway leaves Liberty Center and enters rural Henry and Fulton Counties, passing through farmland. The route enters Delta and passes under a set of railroad tracks. The road continues north, passing residential properties, to the center of the town. In the center of town SR 109 turns west concurrent with US 20A and SR 2. The roadway pass through the west side of the town and leaves Delta. West of Delta the road passes under a railroad track and the concurrency ends with SR 109 turning due north. SR 109 heads north through rural farmland, passing over the Ohio Turnpike. After passing over the turnpike the highway as an intersection with the access road the turnpike. The road has an intersection with US 20\\\\. North of US 20 the route has an intersection at SR 120\\\\. SR 109 end at the Michigan state line and continues north as M-52. SR 109 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of routes important to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). ODOT's 2011 annual average daily traffic (AADT) calculations showed that the lowest traffic levels were present on the section between US 6 and SR 110, where only 680 vehicles used the highway daily; the peak traffic volume was 7480 vehicles AADT along a section that is concurrent with US 20A and SR 2. History The route that SR 109 takes north of SR 110 was commissioned in 1923 as SR 65, south of SR 110 was not maintained by the state. SR 109 was signed on its alignment from Ottawa to the Michigan state line in 1930. In that year the route north of SR 110 was paved and a section of road from Delta to northwest of Delta was reroute onto it current alignment. The southern section of the route was paved by 1939. No significant changes have taken place to this state route since 1939.

They allow slower travel for large vehicles, such as large trucks or semi-trailer trucks, ascending a steep grade. Since climbing uphill is difficult for these vehicles, they can travel in the climbing lane without slowing traffic. Description Climbing lanes are a roadway lane design, typically used on major routes such as motorways and interstate highways. In the UK, the climbing lane is also referred to as a crawler lane. They allow slower travel for large vehicles, such as large trucks or semi-trailer trucks, ascending a steep grade. Since climbing uphill is difficult for these vehicles, they can travel in the climbing lane without slowing traffic. Variants A variation that has become common with newer roads and more recent widening schemes is to add an additional \\"fast\\" (passing) lane for the stretch which otherwise would have had a crawler lane. This allows underpowered vehicles to remain in the existing \\"slow\\" lane without having to purposely pull left into the \\"slow\\" lane which drivers may not want to do because they then have to try to merge back into faster traffic (possibly still at low speed) when it ends. Instead, the more normal requirement to purposely pull out to pass slower vehicles, and back in after doing so or when the lane ends, generally with a smaller speed differential (as they will be rejoining what is already a passing lane), is placed on faster drivers. Safety Climbing lane in J√§ms√§, Finland.On normally 2-lane roads without a divider, the climbing lane effectively creates a bi- directional central passing lane of the original uphill running lane. Its subsequent risk of head-on collisions, they are sometimes referred to as \\"suicide lanes\\". In some cases to reduce the risk, the road will be signed to prohibit overtaking when going downhill. Variations on this theme include altered road markings to highlight the climbing lane as being a temporary addition to the normal two (shorter dashed lines similar to those on merge/diverge lanes), or more clearly demarcating the two higher speed lanes (e.g. with markings that prevent uphill fast traffic using the downhill lane to pass slightly slower uphill vehicles themselves passing \\"crawlers\\", but still allowing downhill vehicles to overtake using the faster uphill lane if necessary, which has the effect of creating a false \\"center\\" line between the two regular lanes). In the UK the additional climbing lane and the single downhill lane are generally separated by double white solid lines. It is an offence to position any part of your vehicle to the right of a double white line punishable by 3 penalty points, therefore this marking in itself prohibits any use of the climbing lane for overtaking by vehicles travelling downhill. As trucks and recreational vehicles must use low gear to descend slowly, an additional lane may also be built on the downhill side. This prevents the vehicles from overusing their brakes, which may overheat and cause a runaway vehicle.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Koodal Azhagar and his consort Lakshmi as Mathuravalli. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is originally believed to be built by the Pandyas, with later additions by the Vijayanagar and Madurai Nayak kings who commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. Koodal Azhagar is believed to have appeared to slay the demon Somuka who abducted the four Vedas. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the fourteen-day annual Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Stucco image of presiding deity As per Hindu legend, a ruler named Vallabhadeva went incognito everyday to know about the lives of people under him. During one of his visits, a scholar told him that the ultimate goal in life is to \\"collect provisions in summer and save for winter\\", which also meant that one should work during his younger days and save for his old age. Vallabadeva was not convinced and he set this as a competition among scholars to make him realize the true value of life. Vishnucitta, who would later go on to become Periazhwar, one of the twelve most revered saints of Vaishnava sect, came to Madurai from Srivilliputhur. He was believed to have been directed by the heavenly words of Vishnu and he expouned the sacred verses. He explained the concepts of Hitham and Purushartham from Vedas and proclaimed that attained the feet of Narayana could lead to salvation. Vallabhadeva was pleased with the explanation and he awarded a bag of gold to Visnucitta. It is believed that the current gopuram of Srivilliputhur Temple, was built by Periazhwar with the gold won. History The inscriptions in the temple refer the presiding deity as Koodal Azhagiya Perumal. There are inscriptions in the temple indicating generous gifts and endowments in the form of land, houses and gold to maintain and administer the temple. An inscription from the 8th century indicates the donation of granite stones for the construction of Ardha Mandapa. The temple was expanded during the rule of Madurai Nayaks in the 16th century. The Dwajasthambam mandap (flag staff) and mandap before the Hema Pushkarani were constructed by the Nayaks. The Mathuravalli Thayar Shrine (Thayar) was constructed and The temple was renovated by Muthu KR.V.Alagappa Chettiar of Devakottai in 1923. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Image of gateway tower Koodal Azhagar temple covers an area of about and has a five-tiered gopuram (gateway tower) raising to a height of . The temple is enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with huge granite walls. The central shrine has an elevated structure and houses the images of the presiding deity, Koodal Azhagar, in three forms, namely sitting, standing and reclining postures. The image made of granite is sported in sitting posture and tall. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are present in either sides of Koodal Azhagar. The festival deity is named Vyuga Sundararajar and the image is tall made of panchaloha. The vimana, the shrine over the sanctum is Ashtanga in architecture, which has eight parts, namely, Adhistana (base), three Padas (struct), Prashthana (limb), Griva (leading struct), Shikara (cylindrical holder) and Stupi (top portion). The outer parts of the vimana has stucco images of sages, Dasavatara, Bhuvaraha, Lakshmi Narasimha, Lakshmi Narayana and Narayanamoorthy. The vimana is believed to be the work of Vishwakarma, the divine architect. The shadow of the vimana does not fall on the ground. The Ashtanga Vimana is found in Mannar Koil Ambasamudram Uthiramerur, Thirukoshtiyur and Cheranmadevi temples. The inner walls of the sanctum has paintings of Ashtadikpalagas. The shrine of the consort of Koodal Azhagar, Mathuravalli, is located to the south of the main shrine. There are smaller shrines of Lakshmi Narasimha, Rama, Lakshmi Narayana and Krishna located close to the sanctum. The shrines of Andal, Narasimha and Manavala Mamunigal are found in separate shrines around the first precinct. The shrine of Andal has painting depicting puranic stories and inscriptions detailing devotional literature. The shrines of Garuda, Anjaneya, Ramanuja, Vedanta Desika and Azhwars are found in the second precinct. The pillars in the halls leading to the sanctum have small sculptures. The temple has Navagrahas, the nine planetary deities, in the second precinct. The second floor has a shrine dedicated to Suryanarayana standing along with Devis. The Teppakulam, the temple tank, is located outside the temple premises. It has a centre hall made of granite. Religious significance Periazhwar obtained the name as he is believed to be an ardent worshipper of Vishnu. While coming out of Madurai, he was taken out in procession to Srivilliputhur and he got the divine vision of Vishnu at the instance. He started reciting his composition, Periya Thirumozhi, which was compiled in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam by Manavala Mamunigal. Manavala decreed that the verses of Perizhwar starting with Tirupallandu should be the first and last verse while reciting Pradandam in any sacred occasion in Vishnu temples. Ramanuja, a proponent during the 10th century, believes that Tirupallandu originated at Madurai. Thus Koodal Azhagar temple finds an indomitable position in Vaishnavite belief. During Mahapralaya, the great disaster, the devotees sought the abode of Vishnu in Madurai. It is believed that Vishnu stood as a bulwark against the impending disaster, giving him the name of the city as Naanmadakoodal or Koodal Nagar ('Koodal' in Tamil is bulwark). The place is mentioned to be significant during four ages namely, Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. The temple has Navagrahas, the nine planetary deities, which are otherwise found only in Shiva temples. It indicates the co-existence of Shaivite and Vaishnavite cultures during the medieval period. Literary mention Image of the temple tower Historians are of the opinion that Koodal Azhagar temple finds mention in Sangam literature (3 century BCE - 3 century AD) in works like Madurai Kanchi by Mangudi Marudan, ParipƒÅ·π≠al, Kaliththokai and Silappatikaram. Madurai Kanchi details the Thiruvonam festival celebrated in the temple. Koodal Azhagar temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar, Thirumalisai Alvar and Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar and Koodal Sthala Purana. Koodal Purana details the origin of Vaigai river flowing through Madurai. It is believed that Vishnu stood up as Trivikrama, with one of his foot rising to the skies and the foot reached Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahma. Brahma was pleased to perform ablution to the raised foot and the water is believed to have emerged as a rivulet called Krithimala. A large number of banana trees sprang up in the place and it came to be known as Kadhalivana, a forest of banana trees. Satyavrata, a ruler of Madurai was a staunch devotee of Vishnu. It is believed that once Vishnu came out of the river Krithimala as a fish (Matsya avatar, one of the avatars of Vishnu) to teach Vedas to the ruler. From then on, the Pandyas started having fish as the symbol of the kingdom. Religious practises and festival Legend of Periazhwar The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Vaikasana aagama. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Aravanai Pooja at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Koodal Azhagar and Mathuravalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The fourteen day annual Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) is the most prominent festival of the temple. The festive images of the temple are brought in chariot round the streets of the temple in various mounts during all the fourteen days.

The beautiful fruit dove is distributed in rainforests of New Guinea and the islands of Batanta, Waigeo, Salawati and Misool in West Papua, Indonesia. The female usually lays a single white egg. Its diet consists mainly of various fruits from trees, palms and vines. In the Port Moresby area, birds were found to eat a mixed diet in May. Large Tristiropsis canarioides fruit were taken when available, but the species gets displaced from fruiting trees by larger pigeons such as the collared imperial pigeon (Ducula mullerii). Small Endiandra sp. fruit were very often eaten, but made up only a small quantity of food volume. Other food were Gymnacranthera paniculata and small quantities of Polyalthia sp., Livistona palm fruit, and occasionally pepper (Piper) berries.

She was William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge from 1993 to 2008, and Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge from 1998 to 2009. Early life Marilyn Strathern was born to Eric Evans and Joyce Evans in North Wales on 6 March 1941.University of Cambridge , Marilyn Strathern. Her first formal education experience was at Crofton Lane Primary School, followed by her attendance at Bromley High School. Strathern excelled academically, in part thanks to support and guidance from her mother, a teacher by trade. Following school, she enrolled in Girton College to study Archaeology and Anthropology. She then became a research student there and went on to obtain her PhD in 1968. She married fellow anthropologist Andrew Strathern in 1964 and they had three children together before ending their marriage. Career Strathern has held numerous positions over her career, all of which involved her work with the people of Papua New Guinea and her expertise in feminist anthropology. Her career began in 1970, when she was a Researcher for the New Guinea Research Unit of the Australian National University, followed by a stint from 1976 to 1983 where she was a lecturer at Girton College and then Trinity College from 1984-1985, occasionally making guest lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States, Europe and Australia.American Anthropological Association, 2011.

Fieldwork in Papua New Guinea From her doctoral thesis published in 1972 titled \\"Women in Between\\" to her more recent publications, Strathern is constantly challenging the definitions and social constructs of gender \\"norms\\". In her piece \\"Self-Interest and the Social Good: Some Implications of Hagen Gender Imagery\\" (1981), Strathern notes that \\"[g]ender imagery is‚Ä¶ a symbolic mechanism whereby \\"collective\\" and \\"personal\\" interests are made to seem to be of different orders\\".Marilyn Strathern. 1981 \\"Self-Interest and the Social Good: Some Implications of Hagen Gender Imagery.\\" Pp. 370-391 in Readings for a History of Anthropological Theory,edited by Paul A.

As editor of a collection of articles in \\"Dealing with Inequality: Analysing gender relations in Melanesia and beyond\\", she also brings to the surface the issue of gender \\"equality\\" and what it really means, asking if the definitions of the Western world are in fact correct, or if there is still a sense of patriarchal dominance.Marilyn Strathern. 1987 \\"Dealing with inequality: analyzing gender relations in Melanesia and beyond.\\" Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Taking this approach when studying in such fields as societies in Papua New Guinea has allowed Strathern to push the boundaries of thought on such topics as reproductive technology, intellectual property, and gender in both Melanesia and the United Kingdom. Strathern has spent much time among the Hagen of Papua New Guinea. From here she has developed one of the main themes occurring across her work, that the world is ontologically multiple.Mikala Hansbol, \\"Marilyn Strathern, ontological multiplicity and partial connections.\\" Mikalas Klumme: A Researchers Blog.Marilyn Strathern 2005. Kinship, Law and the Unexpected: relatives are always a surprise. New York: Cambridge University Press. The world is made up of identifiable parts; however, these parts are not separate from one another. She does not address society specifically, but rather looks at socially-constructed multiple realities which exist interdependently with one another. Reproductive Technologies Strathern's work in the 1990s became the basis for a new subdiscipline in anthropology concerned with new reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization. In her two 1992 publications, After Nature: English Kinship in the Late 20th Century and Reproducing the Future: Essays on Anthropology, Kinship and the New Reproductive Technologies, Strathern argued that existing models of nature and culture were transformed by the explicit use of technology to achieve reproduction. In the co-authored study Technologies of Procreation: Kinship in the Age of Assisted Conception she and her colleagues proposed that new definitions of kinship and descent would emerge as a result of the expansion of new reproductive technologies. These studies paved the way for what has since come to be known as the new kinship studies. Selected publications Strathern is the author of numerous publications, including 44 single-authored journal articles, 57 book chapters, and over 15 books written alone or with another author. Her topics vary from Melanesian culture to the culture of the United Kingdom. Strathern's publications on the Melanesian culture focus on gender relations, legal anthropology and feminist scholarship, while her publications on the culture of the United Kingdom lean towards kinship, audit culture, reproductive and genetic technologies. The book she enjoyed writing the most, according to an interview with the American Anthropological Association in 2011, was Partial Connections, written in 1991. Her most famous book, however, is The Gender of Gift published in 1988. In The Gender of Gift, she uses a feminist approach in a new way to argue that Papuan women are not being exploited, but rather the definition is different. Gender, she notes, is defined differently there than it is in the United Kingdom.Mary Douglas 1989, \\"A Gentle Deconstruction.\\" The London Review of Books. London: London Review of Books 11(9): 17-18. Strathern also brings to the surface the fact that theories are dominating themselves and while she knows as an anthropologist, she cannot separate herself from them, she does state that she offers a \\"narrative\\" over an analysis of the situation. =Other publications= * Self-Decoration in Mount Hagen (1971) * Women in Between (1972) * No Money on Our Skins: Hagen Migrants in Port Moresby (1975) * (ed. with C.

He became a prot√©g√© of Bishop Hugh MacDonald, vicar apostolic of the Highland District of Scotland, and, when his family Prince Edward Island in 1772, 13-year-old Angus stayed behind to study for the priesthood in the secret Highland Catholic college at Buorblach near Morar Station. His seminary training was received in Spain since education was then denied Catholics in England, Ireland and Scotland, and professional training, in particular, training for the priesthood, had been expressly forbidden under pain of death by the penal laws against Catholics. MacEachern arrived on Prince Edward Island, then a British colony in North America known as St. John's Island, in 1790 as a young missionary, joining his emigrant family. MacEachern, who would later be recognized as firmly placing Catholic roots in the colony as well as throughout the Maritimes, travelled endlessly in the area as a priest. He was fluent in English, French, and Gaelic, therefore permitting him to minister to a variety of different cultures in the region. In 1816, while serving as priest in Charlottetown, MacEachern was advised by a visiting Bishop from Quebec to build a church in the city and dedicate it to St. Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The church was the first of several that would occupy the lot where the present cathedral stands today. In 1819, MacEachern became Vicar General for most of the Maritimes as well as becoming a Bishop, and by the 1820s he was convinced that the only way to renew the area's religious beliefs was independence from the neglectful Archdiocese of Quebec. MacEachern finally got his wish when the Diocese of Charlottetown, comprising Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and the Magdalen Islands was created in 1829, with MacEachern appointed as its first Bishop. On 30 November 1831, MacEachern founded St. Andrew's College. Located in his large home in St. Andrew's, PEI, the first Catholic College in the Atlantic provinces offered preliminary training for seminarians. Much loved by his people, Bishop MacEachern died in 1835 in Canavoy, Prince Edward Island. His funeral took place in St. Andrew's Church, with burial in the church basement. His remains now lie in the crypt of a nearby chapel.

It is an assumption that something is true.  Explanation  In logic, an argument requires a set of (at least) two declarative sentences (or \\"propositions\\") known as the \\"premises\\" (or \\"premisses\\"), along with another declarative sentence (or \\"proposition\\"), known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure. More complex arguments can use a sequence of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic. Aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to two premises and a conclusion. Premises are sometimes left unstated, in which case, they are called missing premises, for example: Socrates is mortal because all men are mortal. It is evident that a tacitly understood claim is that Socrates is a man. The fully expressed reasoning is thus: Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal. In this example, the independent clauses preceding the comma (namely, \\"all men are mortal\\" and \\"Socrates is a man\\") are the premises, while \\"Socrates is mortal\\" is the conclusion. The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument. Also, additional information is required over and above the meaning of the premise to determine if the full meaning of the conclusion coincides with what is. For Euclid, premises constitute two of the three propositions in a syllogism, with the other being the conclusion. These categorical propositions contain three terms: subject and predicate of the conclusion, and the middle term. The subject of the conclusion is called the minor term while the predicate is the major term. The premise that contains the middle term and major term is called the major premise while the premise that contains the middle term and minor term is called the minor premise. A premise can also be an indicator word if statements have been combined into a logical argument and such word functions to mark the role of one or more of the statements. It indicates that the statement it is attached to is a premise.

The coin was submitted directly to Charles II, King of England as Simon's personal 'petition' that only his coin should be considered as the new format for all future British coinage. Charles II, recently returned to England in 1660 after his exile abroad, commissioned a trial from the then-official engravers to the Royal Mint for this prestigious project. Eager to take the opportunity Simon submitted his silver prototype. It carried his name beneath the King's head, and his petition engraved in 200 letters in two lines around the coin's rim (which is only 3.5mm in depth) reading: :THOMAS SIMON MOST HVMBLY PRAYS YOVR MAJESTY TO COMPARE THIS HIS TRYALL PIECE WITH THE DVTCH AND IF MORE TRVLY DRAWN & EMBOSS'D MORE GRACE; FVLLY ORDER'D AND MORE ACCURATELY ENGRAVEN TO RELIEVE HIM. The marking of the edges of coins as a guard against clipping was only now being adopted in England. Although the coin came too late for King Charles to alter his plans, due to Simon's being in France, Simon produced an extraordinary specimen which today is in the Geoffrey Cope Collection. Another example was on exhibition at the American Numismatic Association museum in Colorado Springs, USA. It is believed that twelve original issues of the Petition Crown are extant today, with nine in museums. The Art of Coins - Petition Crown Simon's coin shows the bust of King Charles II draped in his flowing hair and laurel leaves, with his celebrated lovelock over his right shoulder. The portrait even shows the shadows of the King's veins on his neck. The inscription reads CAROLVS II. DEI. GRA and on the reverse are crowned shields of England, Scotland, Ireland and France, arranged in the form of a cross, with garter and a picture of St. George in the center. There are two C's interlinked in each angle. The reverse of the coin is slightly convex and the obverse concave to show the King as a stronger feature of the coin. A sale of this coin was recorded for ¬£12 in 1775, since then this coin's rarity has seen it become one of the most valuable British coins. In 2007 a sale of the coin for ¬£207,100 set a new record for a British silver coin at auction. CoinLink News However, on 27 March 2014 a similar crown known as the \\"Reddite\\" Crown, also produced by Thomas Simon, sold at Spinks in London for ¬£396,000 including commission becoming the new world record for a British silver coin at auction. The Reddite and Petition Crowns are both struck from the same pair of dies with the only difference between them being the edge inscription. The resulting 'Petition' and 'Reddite' Crowns have long been admired as masterpieces of the engravers' art and are among the most desirable coins of the entire English milled silver series. Though the Roettier brothers continued to produce the dies for the crowns, the influence of these patterns by Thomas Simon can clearly be seen, particularly in the revised portrait that appeared in 1664 which is strongly reminiscent of Simon's ground-breaking portrait.

Lifton's research for the book began in 1953 with a series of interviews with American servicemen who had been held captive during the Korean War. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans, Lifton also interviewed 15 Chinese who had fled their homeland after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. From these interviews, which in some cases occurred regularly for over a year, Lifton identified the tactics used by Chinese communists to cause drastic shifts in one's opinions and personality and \\"brainwash\\" American soldiers into making demonstrably false assertions. The book was first published in 1961 by Norton in New York. The 1989 reprint edition was published by University of North Carolina Press. Lifton is a Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York. Main points In the book, Lifton outlines the \\"Eight Criteria for Thought Reform\\": #Milieu Control. This involves the control of information and communication both within the environment and, ultimately, within the individual, resulting in a significant degree of isolation from society at large. #Mystical Manipulation. The manipulation of experiences that appears spontaneous but is, in fact, planned and orchestrated by the group or its leaders in order to demonstrate divine authority, spiritual advancement, or some exceptional talent or insight that sets the leader and/or group apart from humanity, and that allows reinterpretation of historical events, scripture, and other experiences. Coincidences and happenstance oddities are interpreted as omens or prophecies. #Demand for Purity. The world is viewed as black and white and the members are constantly exhorted to conform to the ideology of the group and strive for perfection. The induction of guilt and/or shame is a powerful control device used here. #Confession. Sins, as defined by the group, are to be confessed either to a personal monitor or publicly to the group. There is no confidentiality; members' \\"sins,\\" \\"attitudes,\\" and \\"faults\\" are discussed and exploited by the leaders. #Sacred Science. The group's doctrine or ideology is considered to be the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or dispute. Truth is not to be found outside the group. The leader, as the spokesperson for God or for all humanity, is likewise above criticism. #Loading the Language. The group interprets or uses words and phrases in new ways so that often the outside world does not understand. This jargon consists of thought-terminating clich√©s, which serve to alter members' thought processes to conform to the group's way of thinking. #Doctrine over person. Members' personal experiences are subordinated to the sacred science and any contrary experiences must be denied or reinterpreted to fit the ideology of the group. #Dispensing of existence. The group has the prerogative to decide who has the right to exist and who does not. This is usually not literal but means that those in the outside world are not saved, unenlightened, unconscious and they must be converted to the group's ideology. If they do not join the group or are critical of the group, then they must be rejected by the members. Thus, the outside world loses all credibility. In conjunction, should any member leave the group, he or she must be rejected also.Dr. Robert J. Lifton's Eight Criteria for Thought Reform, Lifton, 1989 edition. Thought-terminating clich√© Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism popularized the term \\"thought-terminating clich√©\\". This refers to a clich√© that is a commonly used phrase, or folk wisdom, sometimes used to quell cognitive dissonance. Though the clich√©d phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying fallacious logic is what makes it thought-terminating. Examples include ‚ÄúEverything happens for a reason‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy? Because I said so‚Äù (Bare assertion fallacy), ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the parent, that‚Äôs why‚Äù (Appeal to authority), ‚ÄúTo each his own‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt's a matter of opinion!‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou only live once‚Äù (YOLO), and ‚ÄúWe will have to agree to disagree‚Äù. Lifton said: > The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought- > terminating clich√©. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are > compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily > memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any > ideological analysis. In George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the fictional constructed language Newspeak is designed to entirely eliminate the ability to express unorthodox thoughts. Aldous Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World society uses thought- terminating clich√©s in a more conventional manner, most notably in regard to the drug soma as well as modified versions of real-life platitudes, such as \\"A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away\\". In her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem, Hannah Arendt described Adolf Eichmann as a pseudo-intellectual who used clich√©s and platitudes to justify his actions and the role he played in the Jewish genocide of World War II. For her, these phrases are symptomatic of an absence of thought. She wrote \\"When confronted with situations for which such routine procedures did not exist, he [Eichmann] was helpless, and his clich√©- ridden language produced on the stand, as it had evidently done in his official life, a kind of macabre comedy. Clich√©s, stock phrases, adherence to conventional, standardized codes of expression and conduct have the socially recognized function of protecting us against reality, that is, against the claim on our thinking attention that all events and facts make by virtue of their existence.\\" See also * Buzzword * Cult * Indoctrination * Loaded language * Mind control * Platitude * Propaganda References External links *Lifton's Thought Reform, describes Lifton's eight methods *Thought reform and the psychology of totalism; a study of \\"brainwashing\\" in China Category:Books about mind control Category:1961 non-fiction books Category:W.

ABUS operates the final two product segments via its subsidiary companies: * Security-Center (alarm and video surveillance systems), founded in June 1999 and bought by ABUS in June 2001. * Schlie√üanlagen GmbH Pfaffenhain (locking systems), bought in January 2003. * SECCOR high security GmbH (electronic locking systems and switching devices) was bought in September 2010. In October 2003 the product area of escutcheon plates was taken over from the door hinge manufacturer Dr. Hahn in M√∂nchengladbach. Due to the close relationships with the parent company ABUS, the names of the subsidiaries were changed to ABUS Security- Center GmbH & Co.

The family belongs to the evangelical exclusive wing of the Plymouth Brethren (Br√ºdergemeinde), a church movement that originated in the 19th century. The family's religious orientation also affects the company. The company's self- portrayal refers to the fact that the company's mission statement is shaped by Christian principles. The equal participation of female family members in the company is rejected. There is therefore no woman among the KG shareholders. In order to exclude the succession of daughters, so-called inheritance waiver agreements have been concluded in the past.

It is the largest annual event in the San Joaquin Valley, attracting more than 600,000 people each October during its two-week run featuring exhibits, a livestock show, live horse racing, musical entertainment, educational programs and more. The Fair provides a link between urban and rural California, serving as a tool to educate visitors on the region's rich agricultural industry. The mission of The Big Fresno Fair is to \\"Educate, Celebrate and Have Fun.\\" In addition to being the site of the annual Fair, the Fresno Fairgrounds serves as a year-round rental facility that spans 165 acres held under a 50-year lease with the County of Fresno. The Fresno Fairgrounds hosts more than 250 annual events such as conventions, trade shows and banquets located in Fresno, California. More than 1.5 million people visit the Fresno Fairgrounds annually. The district is self-funded through business operations and generous community contributions; it does not receive any funding from the State for operations. The district's budget is managed by CEO John Alkire, administrative management and staff, and is overseen by a nine- member Board appointed by the Governor's office. The district derives its annual income from three main sources: the annual Big Fresno Fair, weekly satellite wagering and interim events. According to an independent report from 2002, The Big Fresno Fair contributes more than $68.6 million in economic impact to Fresno County annually. A virtual fair is planned in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled all live events & rides. There were cancellations in 1917‚Äì18 & 1942‚Äì44.

Pursuant to Executive Order 9066, thirteen makeshift detention facilities were constructed at various California racetracks, fairgrounds, and labor camps. These facilities were intended to confine Japanese Americans until more permanent internment camps could be built in isolated areas of the country, such as Manzanar and Tule Lake in California. Beginning on March 30, 1942, all native-born Americans and long-time legal residents of Japanese ancestry living in California were ordered to surrender themselves for detention. 5,344 Japanese Americans from Fresno and the surrounding area passed through the Fresno Assembly Center before being transferred to the Jerome War Relocation Center in Arkansas and Gila River, Arizona.Fresno\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 17 Jun 2014) California Historical Landmark #934 is a memorial dedicated to the more than 5,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were confined at the fairgrounds from May to October 1942. The marker is part of an expanded Fresno Assembly Center Memorial that lists in bronze the names of all who were incarcerated there with photos and personal commentaries by former Valley internees and their families. Banners highlighting photos from the era also educate visitors about the historical significance of the site.

No segment of this state highway is included within the National Highway System, a network of routes determined to be the most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History When it debuted in 1937, SR 576's routing occupied the portion of its existing alignment between its present southern terminus at SR 2 southwest of Bryan and its eastern junction with SR 107 in Montpelier. At that time, the current stretch of SR 576 between the western SR 107 junction and the eastern US 20 intersection was included as a portion of US 20A, while the stretch between US 20 and the Michigan state line was designated as SR 571. By 1957, SR 576 took on the shape that it has today, when it was extended northerly out of Montpelier concurrent with US 20A to US 20, then west along US 20 a short distance, and north over the former SR 571 to its present northern terminus at the Michigan state line. The US 20A concurrency between Montpelier and US 20 was removed from SR 576 by 1964 when the alternate route to US 20 was re-routed to mainline US 20 via SR 15 to the east.

The North Sydney Dance Festival is also staged from the theatre. History The need for the Forest Community Centre, incorporating a theatre, grew out of the 1970s population growth in the Forest District, and was championed by The Forest Community Association and Warringah C Ward Councillor and later mayor, Julie Sutton. These efforts culminated in the 1976 approval by Warringah Shire Council of a two-stage concept for the centre designed by architects Sawdy and Black. Stage 1, opened and leased in 1979, consisted of the Forest Squash Centre and Stage 2, comprising the Glen Street Theatre, was officially opened by Shire President Darren Jones in 1985. Warringah Shire, which contributed $1,830,000 towards its construction, became the majority owner/shareholder. Originally a for-hire amateur production theatre, the first professional Glen Street Theatre subscription season was launched in 1994. On 27 February 2013 Warringah Mayor Michael Regan commissioned, with council approval, a $7 million two-stage masterplan for the theatre and community centre precinct, noting: \\"Glen Street is the grande dame of Sydney‚Äôs suburban theatres but, after 27 years, she‚Äôs in need of an overhaul\\". Stage 1 entailed Glen Street Theatre Foyer upgrade and landscaping ($1.8 million), which were completed in early 2015. Stage 2, which entails moving Belrose Branch Library (opened 1979) to the Glen Street frontage, a new caf√© and offices ($5.5 million), was completed in mid-2017.

Throughout his tenure as Bishop of Charlottetown, McDonald resided in Rustico, where he had also lived as a missionary. A church dedicated to St. Augustine was built there in 1838 under McDonald's supervision and served its purpose for many years. There is still a St. Augustine's Church in Rustico today. In 1843, the second basilica for St. Dunstan's was built out of wood while McDonald was Bishop. Realizing that the welfare of his priests in the Diocese was important, Bishop McDonald founded the St. Bernard's Society, which would provide for the care of the priests who became inactive due to old age, illness, or other reasons. This society was active until the 1960s. Although the Bishop closed St. Andrew's College in 1844, he supervised the construction of St. Dunstan's College in Charlottetown (now part of the UPEI campus) in 1848, which attended to the educational needs of boys and girls. In 1856 he spoke out against compulsory bible reading in the public schools.Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Springer Science & Business Media; 1966. . p. 625‚Äì.

It lives in the mesopelagic to abyssal Pacific ocean, near the ocean floor. It is a jawless fish and has a body plan that resembles early paleozoic fish. They are able to excrete prodigious amounts of slime in self-defense. Description The Pacific hagfish has a long, eel-like body, but is not closely related to eels. Maximum body lengths of have been reported; typical length at maturity is around . It is dark brown, gray or brownish red, often tinted with blue or purple. The belly is lighter and sometimes has larger white patches. It has no true fins, but there is a dorsal fin-fold. The head, as in all agnathans, does not have jaws, and the sucker-like mouth is always open. Hagfish have loosely fitting, slimy skins, and are notorious for their slime-production capability. When disturbed, they ooze proteins from slime glands in the skin that respond to water by becoming a slimy outer coating, expanding into a huge mass of slime. This makes the fish very unsavory to predators, and can even be used to clog the gills of predatory fish. Pacific hagfish can create large amounts of slime in just minutes. The slime is notoriously difficult to remove from fishing gear and equipment, and has led to Pacific fishermen bestowing the nickname of 'slime eel' on the species. Hagfish also possess the unique ability to tie their bodies into knots. This adaptation becomes useful when the fish needs to remove the suffocating nature of its own slime by pulling itself through a knot. The knots also provide aid in the process of ripping apart meat. Distribution and habitat The Pacific hagfish occurs in the Eastern North Pacific from Canada to Mexico. It inhabits fine silt and clay bottoms on the continental shelves and upper slopes at depths from . The species appears to be abundant within its range. Diet 144x144px While Pacific hagfish likely take polychaete worms and other invertebrates from the sea floor, they are also known to enter dead, dying or inhibited large fish through the mouth or the anus, and feed on their viscera. The Pacific hagfish's skin can absorb nutrients, which has been demonstrated in the laboratory by showing the passage of amino acids through hagfish skin. The diet of other hagfish species includes shrimps, hermit crabs, cephalopods, brittlestars, bony fishes, sharks, birds and whale flesh, but specific information about the Pacific hagfish is lacking. Reproduction Hagfish fertilise their eggs externally after the female has laid them. On average females lay about 28 eggs, about in diameter, which are carried around after they have been fertilised. Females will however try to stay in their burrows during this period to ensure the protection of their eggs. Use by humans There is a well-developed hagfish fishery on the US West Coast that mostly supplies the Asian leather-market. Hagfish-skin clothing, belts, or other accessories are advertised and sold as \\"yuppie leather\\" or \\"eel-skin\\".

Description The chestnut lamprey has a maximum length of around , in Canada, with dark grey to olive skin color, blue-black after spawning, and with five to eight bicuspid laterals around its mouth. The chestnut lamprey is closely related to the nonparasitic southern brook lamprey, and the two have been termed a paired species. Distribution and habitat The range of the chestnut lamprey extends from Lake Winnipeg and the Hudson Bay down the Mississippi River to the Central and Eastern United States; this includes any large lakes or reservoirs where large host fish are present. In Canada, the chestnut lamprey has been found in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. Ecology Adults are parasitic and feed on larger species of fish to support their body. It was widely presumed that this fish did not feed during the winter, but recent research in Wisconsin has revealed some lampreys remain attached to their host during the winter months; one fisherman caught a sturgeon with a chestnut lamprey still attached. Observation of this species has revealed that they are primarily a nocturnal animal and they seek out shade during daylight. These lampreys may be beneficial to the rivers and lakes, due to their natural control of local fish populations. Human populations can pose threats to these animals through pollution, siltation, and dredging. Larval lamprey must filter feed for numerous years and are vulnerable to changes in their environment during this time. For instance, larval lampreys will starve if large particulate matter regularly block their mouths. Life history During the egg stage of the lamprey's life, it is vulnerable to predators that prefer to eat fish eggs. Predation by other fish helps keep the lamprey numbers under control. When the lamprey has hatched from its egg into the larvae stage, it is limited to pools or backwater areas with a sand or sandy mud bottom. The young lampreys filter feed for food for around five to seven years until they are large enough to attach themselves to a host species. Spawning of this species of lamprey occurs from June to July when the animals are around seven to nine years old and migrate to tributaries to protect the young from predators, though most spawning activity has been observed in mid-June. During the mating process, one female would begin moving rocks from a suitable area for eggs; afterward she attaches herself to a rock while hopeful males attach to her and stroke her tail attempting to mate. The eggs are then covered with a rock, presumably to shade the young lampreys at birth and to keep any predators from devouring the young. As with most lampreys, the chestnut lamprey only mates once during its entire life and dies shortly after.

It is open daily except Christmas; an admission fee is charged.St. George Village Botanical Garden American Public Gardens Association  History  The garden is set in and around the restored buildings and ruins of a 19th-century Danish sugarcane plantation. It contains over 1500 native and exotic species and varieties, including bromeliads, cactus and succulents, a conservation garden, a dry palmetum, heritage gardens, orchids, ornamental ferns, native arboretum (about 50 species), naturalized forest, rainforest (irrigated), and sansevieria collection.St. George Village Botanical Garden It also contains a herbarium (5000 specimens) and a library of 500 volumes, housed in a post-emancipation workers' cottage restored in the early 1980s.  Collections  Agave eggersiana endemic and endangered species of St. Croix. The 16 acres gardens house the most complete collection of plants in the Virgin Islands. The garden mission is to conserve the native plant species of St. Croix, as well as threatened species from other Caribbean islands that adapt to local environmental conditions. In addition, the garden preserves the ethno-botanical history of St. Croix, through living exhibits, graphics, and structural displays. Through its gardens and collections, it is an educational center for a better understanding, not only of the island botanical heritage, but also of the potential horticultural for contemporary gardening in the Virgin Islands. There are more than 1,500 variety is of plants in the garden, which are grouped in different collections: Collections * Bromeliads, contains both the epiphytes and the terrestrial species, and is found within the stabilized ruins of the plantation's sugar factory. The collection shows the diversity of this group of plants, from the rosette shapes that trap water and nutrients in their central \\"cups\\" or the tillandsias with their elongated leaves containing small hairs, which trap and absorb water of moisture in the air. * Cactus and Succulents, growing within the ruins of a 19th century sugar factory, contain both native and exotic species, as well as some rare endangered species. It focuses on the species of Cuba and Trinidad and Tobago, with an emphasis on Central America and the Greater Antilles. * Conservation Garden, is one of the most recent collections of the botanical garden and contains rare and endangered species from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The signage and labeling throughout the area represents the need for conservation of these species, as well as the reasons for their possible extinction. \\"St. George Village\\" is an affiliate member of the Center for Plant Conservation, the only national organization dedicated exclusively to preventing the extinction of threatened flora in America. The garden reflects this concern in its mission statement, exposing plants to visitors and monitoring their cultivation. Among these species is the Agave eggersiana species endemic from the island of St. Croix. * Palmetum of dry climates species, because St. Croix is a tropical island in a dry place, the Botanical Garden Palmetum, with more than 65 species, specializes in the cultivation of palms that grow dry in the Caribbean and adjacent regions of Central and South America. * Jungle Exotic, because St. Croix is a tropical island in a dry place, this area contains plants that are not seen locally in natural associations. The jungle is the only area of the garden that is watered daily. Here we find anthurium, heliconias, bromeliads, gingers, orchids, Araceae, and Hedychium coronarium . * Heritage Gardens, these natural heritage gardens are collections of plants that have been used historically in the Caribbean to meet basic human needs. Here there are several sections such as; The garden of medicinal herbs; The garden of the dyes; The Garden of the Antilles; Traditional fruit trees in orchards in the West Indies; The garden of spices; Trees of historical importance; The garden of the straw and the weaving; A typical Antillean garden of mixed flowers; The sugar cane garden. * Native Arboretum, although much of St. Croix is now covered in trees that were introduced and have become naturalized, this area of the garden, containing approximately 50 species, is dedicated to trees that are considered \\"native\\" according to the oldest botanical records. Thus Ceiba pentandra, Tecoma stans, Hura crepitans. It contains many examples of trees that have had commercial or economic value and have been harvested to near extinction on the island. The ultimate goal of the Arboretum is to provide propagation material for the reintroduction of these native species into the wild. * Orchids, the St. George orchid collection includes 60 species and hundreds of orchids hybrids. Visitors can enjoy a year-round display of flowering specimens at the \\"Marmaduke Orchid House\\". Also many of them can be found thriving on trees through gardens, including examples of native species.

He was a prominent lecturer at Cambridge University, and was William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology from 1973 to 1984. Among his main publications were Death, property and the ancestors (1962), Technology, Tradition, and the State in Africa (1971), The myth of the Bagre (1972) and The domestication of the savage mind (1977). Early life and education Born 27 July 1919, Goody grew up in Welwyn Garden City and St Albans, where he attended St Albans School. He went up to St John's College, Cambridge to study English Literature in 1938, where he met leftist intellectuals like Eric Hobsbawm. Military service Goody left university to fight in World War II. Following officer training, he was commissioned into the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), British Army, on 23 March 1940 as a second lieutenant. Fighting in North Africa, he was captured by the Germans and spent three years in prisoner-of-war camps. At the end of the war he held the rank of lieutenant. Following his release, he returned to Cambridge to continue his studies. He officially relinquished his commission on 19 January 1952. Academic career Inspired by James George Frazer's Golden Bough and the archaeologist V. Gordon Childe, he transferred to Archaeology and Anthropology when he resumed university study in 1946. Meyer Fortes was his first mentor in Social Anthropology. After fieldwork with the LoWiili and LoDagaa peoples in northern Ghana, Goody increasingly turned to comparative study of Europe, Africa and Asia. Between 1954 and 1984, he taught social anthropology at Cambridge University, serving as the William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology from 1973 until 1984.Venn database of Cambridge University offices and officers He gave the Luce Lectures at Yale University‚ÄîFall 1987. Goody has pioneered the comparative anthropology of literacy, attempting to gauge the preconditions and effects of writing as a technology. He also published about the history of the family and the anthropology of inheritance. More recently, he has written on the anthropology of flowers and food. Later life Goody died on 16 July 2015, aged 95. His funeral was held on 29 July at the West Chapel, Cambridge City Crematorium. Honours In 1976, Goody was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). He was an associate of the US National Academy of Sciences. In the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor \\"for services to Social Anthropology\\", and therefore granted the use of the title sir. In 2006, he was appointed Commandeur dans l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Republic. Works Jack Goody explained social structure and social change primarily in terms of three major factors. The first was the development of intensive forms of agriculture that allowed the accumulation of surplus ‚Äì surplus explained many aspects of cultural practice from marriage to funerals as well as the great divide between African and Eurasian societies. Second, he explained social change in terms of urbanisation and growth of bureaucratic institutions that modified or overrode traditional forms of social organisation, such as family or tribe, identifying civilisation as \\"the culture of cities\\". And third, he attached great weight to the technologies of communication as instruments of psychological and social change. He associated the beginnings of writing with the task of managing surplus and, in a paper with Ian Watt (Goody and Watt 1963), he advanced the argument that the rise of science and philosophy in classical Greece depended on the invention of the alphabet. As these factors could be applied to any contemporary social system or to systematic changes over time, his work is equally relevant to many disciplines. =Books= * 1956 The Social Organisation of the LoWiili (London, H.M.S.O.), 2nd ed. 1976, London, published for the International African Institute by the Oxford University Press * 1962 Death, Property and the Ancestors: A Study of the Mortuary Customs of the LoDagaa of West Africa, Stanford, Stanford University Press * 1968 ed., Literacy in Traditional Societies (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press); translated into German and Spanish. * 1971 Technology, Tradition, and the State in Africa, Oxford, Oxford University Press * 1971 The Developmental Cycle in Domestic Groups, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1972 The Myth of the Bagre, Oxford, Oxford University Press * 1973 ed., The Character of Kinship, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1974 with Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, Bridewealth and Dowry, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1976 Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1977 The Domestication of the Savage Mind, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; translated into Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Turkish. * 1982 Cooking, Cuisine and Class: A Study in Comparative Sociology, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; translated into Spanish, French and Portuguese. * 1983 The Development of the Family and Marriage in Europe, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; translated into Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese. * 1986 The Logic of Writing and the Organisation of Society, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; translated into Spanish, German, French, Italian, Polish, Portuguese. * 1987 The Interface Between the Written and the Oral, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1990 The Oriental, the Ancient and the Primitive: Systems of Marriage and the Family in the Pre-Industrial Societies of Eurasia (Studies in Literacy, the Family, Culture and the State), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1993 The Culture of Flowers, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; translated into French and Italian. * 1995 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918‚Äì1970, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 1996 The East in the West, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; translated into French and Italian. * 1997 Representations and Contradictions: Ambivalence Towards Images, Theatre, Fictions, Relics and Sexuality, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers; translated into Spanish and French (Paris, La D√©couverte). * 1998 Food and Love: A Cultural History of East and West, London, Verso * 2000 The European Family: An Historico-Anthropological Essay (Making of Europe), Oxford, Blackwell Publishers * 2000 The Power of the Written Tradition, Washington and London, Smithsonian Institution Press , Washington and London, Smithsonian Institution Press * 2004 Islam in Europe, Cambridge, Polity Press * 2004 Capitalism and Modernity: The Great Debate, Cambridge, Polity Press ; translated into French, Turkish. * 2004 Comparative Studies In Kinship, London and New York, Routledge * 2006 The Theft of History, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press ; translated into French, Italian, Spanish, Turkish. * 2008 Family and Inheritance: Rural Society in Western Europe, 1200-1800, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 2010 Myth, Ritual and the Oral, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press ; translated into French and Turkish * 2010 Renaissances: The One or the Many?, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press ; translated into Chinese, French, Italian, Polish, Turkish * 2012 Metals, Culture and Capitalism: An Essay on the Origins of the Modern World, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press * 2018 Changing Social Structure in Ghana: Essays in the Comparative Sociology of a New State and an Old Tradition, London and New York, Routledge =Selected articles= *1956 Jack Goody A Comparative Approach to Incest and Adultery, British Journal of Sociology, Vol. 7, No. 4 (Dec. 1956), pp. 286‚Äì305 *1957 Fields of Social Control Among the LoDagaba The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 87, No. 1 (Jan. ‚Äì Jun. 1957), pp. 75‚Äì104 *GOODY, J. 1959.

Biography Robinson was born near Greenwood, Mississippi. He left home at the age of 18 and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he recorded his first single \\"Tennessee Woman\\" in 1957. In 1959, he made his first recording of \\"As the Years Go Passing By\\", later recorded by several other blues artists. He settled in Chicago in 1962. He recorded his signature song, \\"Somebody Loan Me a Dime\\", in 1967 for the Palos label, the nationwide distribution of which was aborted by a freak snowstorm that hit Chicago. A cover version was recorded by Boz Scaggs in 1969, but the song was misattributed, and legal battles ensued. It has since become a blues standard, being \\"part of the repertoire of one out of every two blues artists\\", according to the Encyclopedia of Blues (1997). Robinson re- recorded the song for the critically acclaimed album Somebody Loan Me a Dime in 1974, the first of three he recorded for Alligator Records. Robinson was nominated for a Grammy Award for the second, 1977's I Hear Some Blues Downstairs, which contained a rerecording of \\"As the Years Go Passing By\\". Robinson's third album for Alligator, Nightflight, was released in 1984. Robinson played guitar on Larry Davis's original recording of \\"Texas Flood\\". Davis later became a guitar player, but for \\"Texas Flood\\" Robinson provided the distinctive guitar parts, with Davis on vocals and bass, flamboyant keyboardist James Booker on piano, David Dean on tenor saxophone, Booker Crutchfield on baritone saxophone and an unknown drummer. In the 1970s Robinson was arrested and imprisoned for involuntary manslaughter in connection with a car accident. Paroled after nine months, he continued playing in Chicago clubs and later taught guitar. Robinson died of complications from brain cancer, in Rockford, Illinois. His signature song, \\"Somebody Loan Me a Dime\\", was used in the film The Blues Brothers; the song is playing on the radio when Jake (John Belushi) is being transported and paroled.

The highway runs through farm land along Lime Creek outside of the two communities, providing access to the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area. The trunkline dates back to the early 1930s, and has been unchanged since a realignment in 1980. Route description SR 108 crosses into Michigan on the southern edge of Morenci where it becomes M-156. From there the road continues northward on East Street through residential neighborhoods for about to Main Street near downtown where it turns west. The trunkline follows Main Street for three few blocks before turning north on North Street. The highway exits town near the Oak Grove Cemetery. M-156 follows Lime Creek Highway, which runs parallel to the stream of the same name, through farm land. Near the intersection with Morenci Highway, M-156 crosses a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway in the community of Seneca.

It was directed by Nunnally Johnson and produced by Goffredo Lombardo, from a screenplay by Johnson based on the 1953 novel The Fair Bride by Bruce Marshall. Giorgio Prosperi wrote the dialogue for the Italian version. The music score for the American version was by Bronislau Kaper and by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino for the Italian version. The cinematography was by Giuseppe Rotunno. Plot Young Catholic priest Arturo Carrera (Bogarde) sympathizes with the poor in the Spanish Civil War, but finds that his fellow priests have little concern for the poor, because they support the Nationalist rebels. He then resigns from the priesthood. Hours later, the city is bombarded and he takes shelter with a mysterious beautiful woman named Soledad (Gardner). They part. As night falls, Loyalist speakers induce a mob to torch the church, whose ranking cleric moves to hide the Blood of St John relic by giving his deputy the task of taking it to Franco's Nationalists. Both the deputy and Arturo become hunted men. Arturo seeks shelter in a local cabaret, where he again meets the mystery woman, who turns out to be a prostitute. Soledad discovers that Arturo was a priest, but because she likes him, she tries unsuccessfully to hide him from the militiamen. Hawthorne, a habitu√© of the bar and a New York war correspondent (Joseph Cotten) with a platonic relationship with her, does his best to free Arturo. Arturo tells the Loyalist intelligence chief he can make himself useful by comforting Catholic Loyalists who are wavering because of the treatment of the Church. Out of jail, but under surveillance, Arturo meets Soledad and the priest who has hidden the holy relic. The absence of the relic is causing unrest in the town and unsettling the local Loyalist militia, now suffering massive desertions because of the missing relic, which is fabled to provide victory to those who possess it. This makes it essential for the local Loyalists to secure it. But because of a well-meaning, disastrous attempt to feed the old priest in hiding, Soledad leads Loyalist security men to his hideout. Despite torture, the old priest refuses to give up the relic's location, and is to be shot at dawn. The security chief then has Arturo hear the condemned priest's confession. Learning of the relic's whereabouts, Arturo takes it, but claims not to know where it is. But he is then arrested and taken to see the torturing of Soledad, for whom he has declared his love. Soledad is spared by the arrival of the commanding general, an old man who disapproves of torture and dirty tricks. He orders all 250 prisoners to be marched out to the battle lines. There they will be given arms to slow the Nationalist advance on the city and cover the Loyalists' retreat. On the march, Arturo gives Soledad the relic so she can try to take it to safety. However, in a surprise nighttime rebel attack, she is seriously wounded. The prisoners change hands, but the Nationalist commander decides he cannot trust them or leave them behind; he orders that they be executed. Arturo pleads with the officer assigned the task, but the man does not believe Arturo's story. Before more than a few unfortunates have been shot, however, Soledad and the relic are found. She dies, but the prisoners are set free.

It is an extinct subspecies of the Tasman starling (Aplonis fusca), the only other subspecies being the Norfolk starling which is also extinct. It was endemic to Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, part of New South Wales, Australia. Description 5: egg The Lord Howe starling was 18 cm long. The head, the neck, the mantle and the throat were glossy metallic green. The back was slaty grey with a dull greenish gloss. The rump and the underparts were grey. The tail was grey with brownish tips to the feathers. The wings were rich brown. The iris was orange red. Ecology The starlings were called \\"red-eyes\\" from their eye colour, or \\"cudgimeruk\\" from their distinctive calls, by the islanders. They were forest dwellers which lived and foraged in pairs. During the nesting period a clutch of four to five bluish red-blotched eggs were laid in a nest in a hollow in a dead tree or tree fern. Extinction The fate of the Lord Howe starling was sealed in June 1918 when the SS Makambo grounded at Ned's Beach, thus allowing black rats to leave the vessel and overrun the island. Within two years 40% of Lord Howe's endemic bird species were extinct, including the Lord Howe fantail, Lord Howe gerygone, and robust white-eye. The Lord Howe starling vanished by 1919.

During the rule of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, Kniƒáanin's political career began as a commissioner of the Jasenica municipality in 1835, and in 1839 as a commissioner of the Smederevo district, but he eventually joined the opposition as a Constitutionalist and supporter of the rival Prince Aleksandar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. Since he supported \\"ustavobranitelji\\" (the defenders of the constitution), he was expelled from the Principality of Serbia in 1840‚Äì1841.

During the 1848 Revolution, the Hungarians demanded national rights and autonomy within the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognize the national rights of other nationalities which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time. As part of the Revolutions of 1848, the Serbs under Austria-Hungary demanded what they had in the previous century; recognition of Serbian as official language, equality of the Orthodox church as with Catholics, and annual church assembly gatherings.Jelavich, p. 316 They met at Sremski Karlovci and Novi Sad. Several thousand Serbs met at the May Assembly in Sremski Karlovci on 1 May 1848. The delegates chose prominent Austrian-Serb general Stevan ≈†upljikac as voivode, the civil and military commander (Duke). Josif Rajaƒçiƒá was elected the patriarch of the Serbs. The Serbs demanded a national unit consisting of Banat, Baƒçka, Baranja and part of Srem, known collectively as Vojvodina. This was completely against the Hungarian authorities visions. From May 1848 onward, Serbs of Vojvodina directly sought aid from the Serbian Principality, and on 10 May, general Stratimiroviƒá, head of the main committee, appealed to Prince Aleksandar for assistance and urged Kniƒáanin to intercede.David MacKenzie, Ilija Gara≈°anin, Balkan Bismarck, 1985, p. 97, , Knicanin was elected military commander.Charles Jelavich, South Slav nationalisms, p. 192, , He had no prior experience in war, nor went to military school. In June and July a large wave of volunteers from the Principality entered Vojvodina. Kniƒáanin arrived on 25 July. Among others who arrived were: the brother and nephew of Hajduk Veljko, council member Milutin Petroviƒá, major Stanojlo Petroviƒá, captain Sava Petroviƒá and voivode prota Nenadoviƒá.

Discs are written in the \\"Yellow Book\\" standard data format (used for CD-ROMs and DVD- ROMs), as opposed to the Red Book standard audio format (used for CD-DA audio CDs). Description Compressed audio files are supported by many modern CD players as well as DVD players. Disc players are capable of playing compressed formats, such as MP3, the most commonly used format, as well as Ogg Vorbis, the proprietary Windows Media Audio and ATRAC. Because of audio data compression, optical discs do not have to spin all of the time, potentially saving battery power; however, decompressing the audio takes more processor time. The audio is buffered in random-access memory, which also provides protection against skipping. The number of files that a disc can hold depends on how the audio files are encoded and the length of the audio. A standard audio CD (74 minutes) can hold about 18 audio programs, a 650-MB data CD (equivalent to 74-minute audio CD) containing mid-quality (160-kb/s) audio files can hold approximately 9.5 hours of audio or about 138 audio tracks. ID3 tags stored in compressed audio files can be displayed by some players, and some players can search for audio files within directories on a compressed audio optical disc. There is no official standard for how audio files on a compressed audio optical CD are stored on discs. As such, the format expected by different players varies. This sometimes leads to incompatibilities and difficulty in playing discs, often because of filename length limits, sub- directory limits, number of files limits, and special character bugs. Sometimes, pressed CDs containing MP3s can be used, since some CD-ROM video games can act as an \\"MP3 CD\\" for some users. Some older classic CD-ROM games tend to use WAV files since WAV files were the biggest audio format throughout the 90s, in which WAV files on optical discs are also compatible with CD players which have Yellow Book CD-ROM support. Use in audiobooks This technology is most commonly used in audiobooks new on CD since 2000 or so. Especially since unabridged audiobooks can run into many hours length. CEA/APA has published the following standards on audiobooks. *CEA-2003-C - Digital Audiobook File Format and Player Requirements *CEA-2004, Audiobook Media and Player Compatibility.http://www.ce.org/Standards/Product-Marks/Audiobook- Marks,-CEA-2003-C.aspx Advantages compared to Red Book audio CDs *longer runtime as per file compression **6 red book audio discs for the price of one Yellow Book (CD-ROM), depending on file compression rates *Longer battery life from fewer disc spins *Discs marketed without \\"music\\" endorsement aren't rejected since Yellow Book mode (CD-ROM) is being used instead of Red Book audio mode. Disadvantages compared to other means to play compressed digital audio Most disadvantages with compressed audio optical discs are present with CDs, and DVDs in general. =Re-write (RW) limits and compatibility compared to write-once (R)= Compared to solid-state flash memory which can be rewritten a finite amount of about 100,000 times and hard drives which can be rewritten a near-infinite number of times, optical discs with compressed audio on them are either non-rewritable (CD-R/DVD-R), or can only be rewritten about 1000 times, which includes having to erase the entire volume before re- writing (CD-RW/DVD-RW). In some cases 1000 write/erase cycles (including entire volume erasure per re-write) on RW optical discs vs. 100,000+ write/erase cycles on flash memory (while retaining old data) can be somewhat of a moot point with applications that have less demand for usage. Another issue re-writable optical discs suffer from, is that the re-writable discs have less compatibility with older disc players, though most CD and DVD players that support MP3s and other compressed audio will support RW discs easily. =Longevity of service life= The dependency of moving parts for the associated equipment guarantees less runtime than solid-state Portable media players for battery life reasons, as well as the overall service life. When being looped, an optical disc player can fail in less than one month when spinning uninterrupted, and solid-state portable media players can run for as long as 6 months uninterrupted without failure. =Shelf space= Yellow Book optical disc ROMs with compressed audio may free up as many as five Red Book audio CDs, but they still demand much shelf space, compared to external hard drives and solid-state flash memory. =Material degradation= Unlike mechanical disks with permanent housing such as hard drives, and solid-state devices like flash memory which generally has inexpensive but tough housing, optical discs typically have a reflective surface that can get damaged at relatively low thresholds of surface damage, in which if damage is just accidental, it could mean rendering it unusable. Also, the repeated handling of discs between jewel case and disc drive exposes the disc to dust, and also makes the disc liable to be damaged permanently. Also note that some CD and DVD discs also have defective aluminum layers that can flake, and damage the disc naturally. If an archival-grade disc is used, such as gold CD or M-DISC, the disc can last far longer than hard drives or flash memory. =File/volume size limits and access to files= Repeated insertion and removal of optical discs can occur when somebody has to deal with multi-gigabyte collections which can span across as many as 10 CD-Rs (or 5 DVD-Rs) or even more when lots more gigabytes were to be used. Sometimes when somebody is looking for a specific MP3 or similar; it can result in insertion and removal if more discs were used to increase the size of a library of files, in which copying the files to a hard drive, and archiving them there can be a workaround to ensure faster access to files. Recordable Blu-ray Discs can somewhat solve this problem, but they too suffer from most other disadvantages. The high cost of stand-alone Blu-ray burners, as well as the higher cost of equipment with BD- ROM drives can negate buying sold-state flash memory instead, of which the re- writability of flash memory also negates Blu-ray's apparent advantages.

It was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1850 and is the oldest existing school in central Auckland. History St Mary‚Äôs College is the oldest existing secondary school for girls in Auckland and one of the oldest existing schools in New Zealand. It was established in 1850 on the site of the present St Patrick's Cathedral, in Wyndham Street by the Sisters of Mercy, who were founded in Ireland by Catherine McAuley in 1831. The Sisters of Mercy were the first religious sisters to come to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland from Ireland on 9 April 1850. A large new convent was built in Ponsonby, on a splendid site overlooking the Waitemata Harbour and the central business district of Auckland City and the school was shifted there in 1861. St Mary‚Äôs College has always had an excellent academic record and high achievement in Music and Sport. Its musical tradition goes back to the 1860s. During the 20th Century, under the outstanding direction of the late Dame Sister Mary Leo, the school produced many singers of international fame, notably Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Mina Foley. The school is known for its music with a compulsory music programme running from year 7-9. At St Mary's the school believes that music enhances the mind. They have a number of bands which play at festivals all around the world. In 2005 the Sinfonia was invited to play at the Beijing Arts Festival in China. In 2006 the school's band went to Palm Springs, CA for a music festival. The Mercy character continues to be a dominant focus of the school's ethos. The college is still owned by the Sisters of Mercy who have established a Board of Directors which works in conjunction with the Board of Trustees to ensure that the Catholic character of the school is not only maintained but enhanced and promoted.

An aid station is a temporary facility (often a tent, table, or general rest area) established to provide supplies to endurance event participants or medical first aid and provisions during major events, disaster response situations, or military operations.Special Events Medical Services by Clay Richmond & Doug Poore (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2012) Aid stations may be divided into sections where the station serves both medical and non-medical functions. Sporting events An aid station at the 2007 Soochow 24-hour ultramarathon. At endurance races like marathons or bicycle racing events, aid stations are established along the race route to provide supplies (food, water, and repair equipment) to participants. During modern cycle races, aid station functions may be performed by a mobile SAG Wagon (\\"Supplies And Gear\\") or support vehicle that travels with participants at the rear of the peloton. Typically sports drinks and energy gels are provided as well as water. Depending on the length of the race, food may be available. Often, medical supplies will also be available.The Chicago Marathon by Andrew G. Suozzo (University of Illinois Press, 2006) The aid station may also serve as a checkpoint to track competitors. During events where the distance between aid stations is predetermined and known by competitors, some trainers advise using aid stations as course markers for pace-setting.Triathlon Revolution: Training, Technique, and Inspiration by Terri Schneider (The Mountaineers Books, 2008) At some major annual marathon events, particular aid stations and their operators have become local institutions. The Chicago Marathon, for example, has annual prizes for aid stations and aid station volunteers and some volunteers have managed the same station each year for many years. The event includes very large stations, some with more than 300 volunteers, and event organisers publish an Aid Station Instruction Book. Military operations Wounded American soldiers receive treatment at an aid station in Korea. During combat or training operations, military units may establish aid stations behind front lines to provide medical support to troops in the field. In United States military operations, these are most commonly referred to as Battalion Aid Stations; in Commonwealth countries, Regimental Aid Posts. The term \\"Main Aid Station\\" is also used depending on size and operational context. Aid stations are the smallest units, passing cases on to Field Ambulances and thence to Casualty clearing stations. During the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815), the French established a tiered system of medical support services. Basic aid stations operated by one field medic were established as close to front lines as possible, sometimes within a few hundred meters to allow for the treatment of wounded troops as soon as possible. The more seriously injured were transported further back behind front lines to field hospitals in churches or nearby chateaus. Those who required more extensive treatment were transported again to much larger permanent \\"receiving\\" military hospitals in France.Military medicine by Jack E. McCallum (ABC-CLIO, 2008) Aid stations may also be established during training operations where the deployment of a \\"full hospital\\" is not required and the injuries treated are not as severe as those experienced during combat operations.Aid station supports 4,000 soldiers during exercise by Sgt. Anderson J. Grant (DVIDS, 14 April 2013) In such situations, aid station medics provide \\"level one\\" care and treatment of non-life-threatening injuries or illness. There is generally no provision for treating \\"serious or life-threatening\\" problems beyond stabilization for transportation to a larger medical facility. Disaster response A temporary Federal Emergency Management Agency aid station. Inside a Disaster Medical Assistance Team aid station. In disaster areas, aid stations may be established to provide triage for injured persons or longer term support for those in need of food or shelter. Aid stations may be established in response to both a natural and man-made disaster events and may remain in place for the duration of the disaster recovery effort or may be replaced by larger or more permanent facilities such as field or mobile hospitals. William L. Waugh gives the example of an aid station established during the aftermath of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse and later replaced with more substantive triage facilities.Handbook of Emergency Management: Programs and Policies Dealing With Major Hazards and Disasters by William L. Waugh, Jr. & Ronald John Hy (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1990) In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA and the Red Cross established a number of emergency aid stations throughout New Orleans and near evacuation centers.

They now compete in the NCAA Division III, mostly as members of the University Athletic Association. The University of Chicago helped found the Big Ten Conference in 1895, although it dropped football in 1939 (as inconsistent with its academic vision), its other teams remained members until 1946. Football returned as a club sport in 1963, as a varsity sport in 1969, and began competing independently in Division III in 1973. The school was part of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference from 1976 to 1987, and its football team joined the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference's successor, the Midwest Conference (MWC), in 2017.

Her program, which aired on Lackawanna Cable TV in Buffalo. This was followed by Maine Cable Television, Bangor. Then came Valley Cablevison Ansonia, Seymour, Derby, CT and Shelton. The last one was Colonial Cablevison near Glens Falls, NY. These cable companies hired Glendora as their public access TV packager. She owned the video equipment, did the videotaping and then returned to the \\"head-end\\", ran a coaxial cable from her video equipment to the public access TV modual, and cable-casted on to the cable TV viewer. The show focused on ordinary people from the local community who were doing extraordinary things. On this program, she interviewed local heroes and heroines, as well as people going above and beyond to perform community service (Smith D1). She also commuted to Buffalo, where her husband, journalist Franklyn Buell, lived. They had married on December 25, 1954, when he was a reporter and later assistant city editor for the Springfield Union (a job he had held since 1948). In 1958, he was reporting for the Buffalo Evening News. Glendora remained on cable and public access television throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1987, she appeared as a guest on Late Night with David Letterman. By the 1990s, she was living in White Plains NY, according to the New York Times, which noted that she was the host of a weekly talk show on local public access there (\\"L.I. Cable\\" 44). According to her website, she is known for telling lawyer jokes, dressing in a white straw hat and wearing white gloves, humming along with the Christian hymns which provide her background music, and for her ethical vegetarianism. She is also known for using the legal system to preserve her right to be on TV. In 1994, she sued and won when a Long Island NY cable system removed her program in a way she felt violated Federal, State and municipal law that no cable operator can exercise editorial control over Public Access TV. The court ruled \\"plaintiff has a statutory right to be on TV and must be returned to TV\\".(\\"L.I. Cable\\" 44). =Author= Glendora is the author of the Glendora Happy Book. In 2010, she was the subject of a documentary about her long career on television. An excerpt can be found here: =Legacy= Glendora's husband Franklyn Buell died October 19, 2003 in Chatham, NY. He left a collection of books about sports, including the baseball encyclopedia, \\"Who's Who in Baseball\\" back to the 1940s and other rare books. He also kept a scrapbook of the baseball games he attended, the box scores of each and the article on each from the newspaper. He saw Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig play in the same game in 1933 in Philadelphia. He has a baseball autographed by Yogi Berra, Lou Penella, Don Mattingly and the others on that year's team. Glendora preserved his work and established a museum about it. All of the articles that Franklyn wrote as a reporter for 37 years are preserved in the Glendora-Franklyn museum. Glendora lived in Kinderhook, NY from 2004 until 2012 and continued her work with her program. She currently resides in the Village of Nassau, NY, where she continues to produce episodes of \\"A Chat With Glendora\\". She claims she is the longest- running TV performer, with broadcast TV and cable TV, and still going. She has applied for the same to the Guinness Book of World Records. As of September 14, 2018 the number of vegan commercials total 121. Those that are on channel 6 CBS Albany can be seen all over the world by computer simply by Google channel 6 Albany NY. The total spent on airtime from May to Dec was $8800. On October 13, 2018 Glendora was inducted into the Hall of Fame American International College Springfield Massachusetts. Glendora Vegetarian Club Six years ago the Glendora Vegetarian Club was initiated at the Nassau Free Library with 27 attendees bringing delectable potluck. 73 meetings later circa 500 people have attended; 1711 hours of time were invested; 826 pages of record have been kept; $30195 were donated to animal helping organizations, feeding wildlife and purchasing vegan food. Articles about the clubs activities have appeared weekly in the local Advertiser newspaper. A video of every meeting was placed on Youtube, facebook, Twitter and the 72 affiliates of the Glendora Public Access Television network. $1000 cash was handed-over personally to charities that support the homeless both in Albany NY and Pittsfield, MA. =Vegan Commercials on broadcast TV 6:00pm News= From May 2018 to Dec 2018 Glendora has done 291 commercials on broadcast TV on channel 6 CBS and channel 10 ABC, Albany NY. Spending $10,000 in airtime urging those to go vegan. She has negotiated with channel 6 CBS Albany New York for the following: Monday through Friday the first week of each month of 2019 equals 60 spots on the 6:30pm news and another $9900 for the same in 2020 The TV channel streams, so that her messages can be seen and heard worldwide wherever there is a computer.

During World War II Bartlett worked in the European Broadcasting division of the BBC, and at night was a Commandant of the Red Cross. She converted to Roman Catholicism in 1941, becoming a Servite tertiary. She opened a residential home for the elderly homeless, having been inspired by hearing Violet Markham speak at Caxton Hall about the plight of many elderly people who had been bombed out during The Blitz. Having already been accepted as a candidate to the Servite Religious Sisters, she was persuaded to delay her entry for this work by her spiritual director, a Servite friar. The Servite Order lent Bartlett ¬£8000 and the Air Raid Distress Fund of London another ¬£3600 to help this project. With this money and other contributions from individual donors, most notably, Albert Oppenheimer (CBE) she purchased a property in The Boltons. It was registered as the Hearth and Home Housing Association, soon known as Servite Housing, and began to operate in 1946. They have since severed their connections with the institute she founded. The following year the Holy See approved the formation of secular institutes under Church law. This was a new form of consecrated life which would be lived by single people following independent lives in general society. Bartlett felt drawn to live in this way rather than in the religious congregation she had planned to join. She immediately began to live as a consecrated person and began to draw up Constitutions for the proposed institute. The first gathering of other women drawn to this took place in 1952. Gradually the group established itself. In the 1960s connections were made with women in Germany and Italy who had a similar orientation in Servite spirituality. The institute received official approval in 1964 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster and they were formally incorporated into the Servite Order. The institute continued to grow, being spread to other countries and received papal recognition in March 1979, at which time she was made a Dame in the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II. The Constitutions of the Institute received final papal approval in February 1994. Members are now found in Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Spain and the United States of America, as well as in the United Kingdom. Independent Catholic News described her as follows: > Joan was a woman of vision, always ahead of her times, and as housing needs > changed she went on to any number of imaginative housing projects. Bartlett remained involved in Servite Housing until her death, having devoted the years since her retirement as Director to fund-raising.

Developed in 1931/1932, it received its patent in August 1937. A previous attempt, the Stromberg company‚Äòs transducer-based \\"Stromberg Electro\\", was introduced in 1928. It used a \\"vibration-transfer rod\\" from the instrument's sounding board attached to magnets inside the guitar, and was not successful. George Beauchamp created the \\"Fry-Pan\\" in 1931, and it was subsequently manufactured by Rickenbacker Electro. The instrument gained its nickname because its circular body and long neck make it resemble a frying pan. It was designed to capitalize on the popularity of Hawaiian music in the 1930s. The instrument was made of cast aluminum, and featured a pickup that incorporated a pair of horseshoe magnets that arched over the strings. Beauchamp and machinist Adolph Rickenbacker began selling the guitar in 1932, but Beauchamp was not awarded a patent\\"ELECTRICAL STRINGED MUSICAL G. D. BEAUCHAMP et al\\" Google Patents, accessed June 14, 2011. for his idea until 1937, which allowed other guitar companies to produce electric guitars in the same period.  Development  In the 1930s, Hawaiian music enjoyed widespread popularity in the United States. However, Hawaiian music featured the guitar as the main melodic instrument, and the volume of acoustic guitars was insufficient for large audiences. Beauchamp, an enthusiast and player of Hawaiian music, mounted a magnetic pickup on his acoustic steel guitar to produce an electrical signal that was electronically amplified to drive a loudspeaker, producing a much louder sound. After discovering that his system produced copious amounts of unwanted feedback from sympathetic vibration of the guitar's body, Beauchamp reasoned that acoustic properties were actually undesirable in an electric instrument. Beauchamp had helped develop the Dobro resonator guitar, and co-founded the National String Instrument Corporation. Through these businesses, he was acquainted with Rickenbacker, who owned the machine company that manufactured the aluminum resonators and brass bodies for the instruments. With Rickenbacker's help, Beauchamp designed a lap steel guitar with a solid aluminum body and neck. Rickenbacker produced the instruments from 1932 to 1939.

In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada advised consumers to avoid intranasal versions of Zicam Cold Remedy because of a risk of damage to the sense of smell, leading the manufacturer to withdraw these versions from the U.S. market. However, in recent years, they have returned to market with both nasal swabs and also dissolving/chewable tablets and nasal spray and oral mist forms, some with zinc, some without.  Ingredients and use  Because this product is a \\"homeopathic\\" over-the-counter drug, it is exempt from a number of the requirements ordinarily applicable to OTC drug products, provided it conforms to the standards of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS) and is labeled as a homeopathic product. The only biologically active ingredients present in Zicam Cold Remedy are zinc acetate (2X = 1/100 dilution) and zinc gluconate (1X = 1/10 dilution). Other sources list the ionic zinc content as \\"33 mmol/L of zincum gluconium\\". Zicam is marketed as a homeopathic product which the maker unscientifically claims can shorten the duration of a cold and may reduce the severity of common cold symptoms.

Safety concerns  = Litigation = In 2006, Matrixx Initiatives paid $12 million to settle 340 lawsuits from Zicam users who said that the product destroyed their sense of smell (medically termed anosmia), although the company did not admit fault. As of 2009, \\"hundreds more such suits have since been filed.\\" In 2005, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers pension fund sued Matrixx Initiatives for misrepresenting the stock by not reporting the risks of Zicam.See Siracusano v. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., 585 F.3d 1167, 1169 (2009). In Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.

The advertiser‚Äôs voluntary discontinuance of the language ‚Äúconcentrated formula‚Äù from its Zicam ULTRA advertising and product packaging was noted and appreciated. It was found that Zicam provided a reasonable basis for the use of ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù for Zicam products that contain more of the active ingredient per dosage unit than their original counterparts and require consumers to take fewer doses per day. = FDA warning and product recall = On June 16, 2009, the FDA advised consumers to discontinue use of three nasally administered versions of Zicam Cold Remedy‚ÄîZicam Cold Remedy Nasal Gel, Zicam Cold Remedy Nasal Swabs, and Zicam Cold Remedy Swabs, Kids Size (a discontinued product)‚Äîbecause the FDA had associated a serious risk of anosmia with them. The advisory did not implicate other Zicam products. The FDA indicated that it had received reports of a loss of smell from approximately 130 Zicam Cold Remedy users since 1999. The FDA voiced concern that the loss of smell may be long-lasting or permanent, while the condition for which these Zicam products are marketed‚Äîthe common cold‚Äîtypically resolves on its own without lasting problems. The manufacturer stated that it had received an additional 800 reports of a loss of smell, but did not turn those over to the FDA as they did not feel they were required to do so.Matrixx Said It Didn‚Äôt Give 800 Zicam Reports to FDA (Update1)Des Moines Register, June 20, 2009, page 16A. The FDA disagreed, and requested copies of any reports that had associated anosmia with intranasal Zicam Cold Remedy. The FDA also issued a Warning Letter to Matrixx, stating that the products cannot be marketed without FDA approval. The company initially refused to recall the productsF.D.A.

The company maintained that most cases of anosmia are due to the common cold itself, and that complaints of anosmia among Zicam Cold Remedy users are unlikely to be more numerous than those expected among the general population. In contrast, the FDA had reported that cases of anosmia associated with intranasal Zicam Cold Remedy products were in excess of those seen with other nasal remedies for the common cold, and that cases associated with intranasal zinc presented more rapidly, and with different symptoms, than did unrelated cases. In addition, the FDA's warning letter prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the company. Through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) filings, Matrixx has requested the FDA to provide the research and evidence that led them to request the withdrawal of Zicam swabs. The company said that \\"fundamental fairness\\" required a clear explanation of the FDA's methodology and analysis.Matrixx again asks FDA to rescind Zicam warning, Matrixx Initiatives, in The Arizona Republic, November 19, 2009 On June 19, 2009, Health Canada, in a foreign product alert, also issued a similar warning based on the U.S. FDA information.Zicam Cold Remedy Nasal Gel, Zicam Cold Remedy Swabs, and Zicam Cold Remedy Swabs, Kids Size ‚Äì Foreign Product Alert  References   External links  * Zicam Website * Matrixx Initiatives Category:Homeopathic remedies Category:Withdrawn drugs ","title":"Zicam"},{"id":"7994188","text":"Mini-UHF connectors are miniaturized versions of UHF connectors, designed primarily for use in bag-type mobile phones and similar applications where size is an important consideration.

He was an expert on mammalian dentition, and a leading contributor to theories of evolution. In addition he was active in presenting his ideas to students and the general public through books and museum exhibits. Early life He was born in Greenwich Village, New York, on May 19, 1876 to George Gregory and Jane King Gregory. He attended Trinity School and then moved onto Columbia University in 1895, initially at the School of Mines but then transferring to Columbia College. He majored in zoology and vertebrate paleontology under Henry Fairfield Osborn. While still an undergraduate he became Osborn's research assistant and soon after married Laura Grace Foote. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia in 1900, followed by a masters in 1905, and a doctorate in 1910. Academic career He developed an early interest in both fishes and the land vertebrates, publishing papers on both groups, including two in Science in 1903. By 1911 he had expanded his interests to encompass amphibians with a paper on the limb structure of the Permian Eryops. Despite his heavy workload he served as editor of the American Museum Journal (which would later become Natural History). He was formally appointed to the scientific staff at the American Museum of Natural History in 1911 and became part of the teaching faculty at Columbia in 1916, eventually rising to the post of Da Costa Professor in the Department of Zoology. His notable students included Alfred Romer, James Chapin, C. L. Camp, and G. K. Noble. He was similarly successful at the museum, becoming full curator of three departments and serving as Chairman of two. Although his work was wide-ranging the overriding focus was on comparative anatomy. His studies often had particular significance in the field of evolution; he believed the anatomical structures of fossil and extant species should exhibit relationships. His work charted the evolution from the early fishes through the various branches to birds and mammals, with numerous papers and two major works: Our Face from Fish to Man in 1929 and Evolution Emerging in 1951. He developed the principle of habitus and heritage ‚Äì theorizing that animals evolved with two sets of characteristics: the heritage features which derived from a long evolutionary history and the habitus characteristics which were adaptations to the environment in which the species existed. He later expanded this to his palimpsest theory which proposed that the habitus features often overlaid and obscured the heritage features. A similar theory, mosaic evolution, has appeared since King Gregory's death. He studied lemurs and the insectivorous primates, as always concerning himself with evolutionary origins. From the 1920s he became involved in the study of marsupials, in 1947 developing his palimpsest theory by showing a connection between the monotremes and early reptiles. Around the early 1920s he also became interested in recent human evolution particularly after the discovery of the early African hominids. His specialist knowledge of mammalian dentition led him to pursue the same path with regard to human evolution and he came to be regarded as the world's leading expert on the evolution of human dentition, a reputation secured by the 1922 publication of The Evolution of the Human Dentition. However, he did initially think the hoax, Piltdown Man, likely to be genuine. Later life He retired from the American Museum of Natural History in 1944 and from Columbia in 1945, and moved permanently to his house in Woodstock, New York, with his second wife Angela, whom he had married soon after Laura's death in 1937. In 1949 he was awarded the Viking Fund Medal in 1949 for his contributions to physical anthropology. He died in the Woodstock house on December 29, 1970. He had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1927 and on his death was one of the oldest members.

Background Alannah Hill was born in Franklin, Tasmania, but spent much of her childhood in the coastal town of Penguin. At the age of 16 she moved to Melbourne, Victoria where she hoped to establish an acting career. She did have one small acting role in the 1986 film Dogs in Space starring Michael Hutchence. Career Whilst waitressing in a cafe, she was offered a job at Indigo Boutique in Chapel Street, South Yarra, where she worked for fifteen years. It was here she created her first designs under the label Alannah Hill. She opened her first boutique in 1997, and with the financial backing of Melbourne-based business Factory X, eventually established 42 Alannah Hill stores in Australia as well as being stocked in David Jones stores. Her collections were stocked in international department stores including Browns and Sefridges of London, and Henri Blendel and Bergdorf Goodmans in New York. In her memoir, Butterfly on a Pin she shares that the names of her designs were often inspired by phrases uttered by her mother.

The length of the glacier is currently decreasing by about 10 m (33 ft) each year. Its volume has diminished by half since the first measurements in 1851. Geography Pasterze and Grossglockner massif, 1900 postcard The glacier reaches from its head, the Johannisberg peak at , to above sea level (m AA). The Pasterze forms the source region of the M√∂ll river, a left tributary of the Drava. Its waters also feed the Margaritze reservoir, used to generate electricity at the Kaprun hydropower plant north of the Alpine crest. The name Pasterze is possibly derived from , \\"pasture\\". Indeed the detection of wood, peat and pollen in the area of the retreating glacier indicate vegetation and also the use as pastureland during the last interglacial period until about 1,500 BC. The surrounding area was purchased by the German and Austrian Alpine Club in 1918; today the glacier is part of the High Tauern National Park. The Pasterze is a major tourist destination, accessible via the scenic Grossglockner High Alpine Road and a funicular railway that leads down to its margin.

During his hospital and teaching career he specialised in obstetrics and gynecology. After retirement in 1991 he devoted his time to researching and publishing papers on Barlow's disease (scurvy in infants), hypothesizing this to be a cause of shaken baby syndrome. Biography Clemetson was born in Canterbury, England, attending Wootton Court preparatory school, Wootton, Kent (1930‚Äì1935) and The King's School, Canterbury (1935‚Äì1942). After preclinical studies at Magdalen College, University of Oxford, he completed his training at Radcliffe Infirmary, graduating from Oxford University in 1948 with Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery (B.M., B.Ch) degrees. He married Helen Cowan Forster, a physiotherapist, on 29 March 1947. They had four children. After graduation, he became a Royal Air Force medical officer for two years, and then returned to Oxford University in 1950 for a MA degree. In 1950, as a research assistant in Obstetrics, he started to pursue research into preeclamptic toxaemia and started to publish medical papers in 1953. In 1952, he was named a Nichols Research Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. From 1952 through 1956, he served at various hospitals in England as the House Surgeon of either Obstetrics or Gynecology and, in 1956, became a lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology at London University. Clemetson immigrated to Saskatoon, Canada (1958‚Äì1961), becoming an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Saskatoon. During this period, he began to be interested in vitamin C while on an expedition to Rankin Inlet, Nunavut on Hudson Bay. Clemetson was impressed by the good capillary strength of the local Inuit and surmised this to be due to raw fish in their diet. Then, in 1961, he moved to California and assumed a position as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, and a lecturer in the Department of Maternal and Child Health at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1967, he assumed a teaching position (1967‚Äì1972) as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology with the State University of New York, Brooklyn. He also became the Director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department (1967‚Äì1981) at the Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn, New York. In addition (1972‚Äì1981), he served as a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York, Brooklyn, New York. Clemetson moved to New Orleans, Louisiana in 1981, and became a professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tulane University School of Medicine, and the Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Huey P. Long Medical Center, Pineville, Louisiana. He also became a consultant in Gynecology for the Department of Surgery, Veterans Administration Hospital, Pineville, Louisiana. Upon his retirement in 1991 as a Professor Emeritus, Tulane University School of Medicine, Clemetson devoted his remaining years to writing and publishing medical papers concerning shaken baby syndrome. Near the end of his life, he narrowly escaped the New Orleans disaster from Hurricane Katrina, having been warned by his caregiver's meteorologist brother-in-law. He escaped with the latter over the Lake Pontchartrain bridge the day before it was destroyed. He lived in Houston, Texas for nearly a year while his family restored his house, but died of heart failure a few weeks after this was completed. Achievements Clemetson had a long and distinguished academic career as a medical doctor, scientist and researcher. During his forty-year professional career, he implemented numerous scientific studies and was instrumental in furthering scientific knowledge. The following achievements are highlights of his life's work that are contained in his extensive Curriculum Vitae.Curriculum Vitae Clemetson's most notable medico-legal achievement was as the father of the \\"Motherhood Bill\\", which requires that all medical insurance carriers in the State of New York include coverage for pregnancy and complications of pregnancy. This so-called Donovan Bill rapidly spread to all 50 states. ;University College Hospital ‚Äì London ‚Äì 1950‚Äì1952 / 1956‚Äì1958 *Demonstrated the effects of cord around the neck and of pre-eclampsia on the oxygen saturation of newborn infants. *Published the first study of \\"small-for-dates\\" infants in his studies of \\"the difference in birth weight of human twins.\\" *Demonstrated impaired active transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus in pre-eclampsia. *Demonstrated aortic hypoplasia in some patients following severe early pre-eclampsia. *Performed and published successful open cardiac massage outside of hospital. ;University of California Medical Center ‚Äì San Francisco ‚Äì 1961‚Äì1967 *Bioflavonoids and catechins ‚Äì Solved the old \\"Vitamin P\\" problem, by showing that bioflavonoids with certain structural characteristics act as indirect antioxidants for Vitamin C.

Mallikarjuneswara and Moshfeghi, he was able to measure the electrical charge on fertilized rat ova, and this was the first time that anyone had ever measured the electrical charge on any mammalian ovum. *He showed conclusively that women on the pill need more Vitamin C than usual, and, as a result of this, a special vitamin formula called \\"Feminins\\" was developed and marketed for women on the pill. *His research on the uterine luminal fluid in the rat showed that estrogen causes secretion and progesterone causes reabsorption of uterine luminal fluid. *In collaboration with J.K. Kim and others, he showed that the luteal phase of the human menstrual cycle is the reabsorptive phase, and not the secretory phase. *In recent research, he has shown that people with low vitamin C levels have very high blood histamine levels. *He was able to relate the above observation to abruptio placentae, as women with low ascorbate (Vitamin C) and high histamine levels are prone to develop premature separation of the placenta. ;Tulane University School of Medicine 1981‚Äì1990 *Wrote three-volume monograph, Vitamin C. Medical hypotheses In 1964, Clemetson conducted and published the first studies concerning ascorbic acid (vitamin C) metabolism and depletion in pre- eclampsia. After Clemetson's retirement from teaching in 1991, his work focused on developing the hypothesis that the hemorrhages seen in infants with shaken baby syndrome are caused not by inflicted trauma, but by capillary damage due to Barlow's disease (subclinical scurvy) ‚Äì a condition called by proponents Clemetson/Kalokerinos syndrome. The mechanism he argued to be high histamine levels associated with low serum vitamin C, the latter deficiency arising before birth due to factors such as the pregnant mother's malnutrition, and in the infant by recurrent infections and recent multiple vaccinations. His four main papers on this topic, published in the controversial and non-peer reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses, are: \\"The key role of histamine in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease\\", \\"Barlow's disease\\", \\"Capillary fragility as a cause of subdural hemorrhage in infants\\" and \\"Elevated blood histamine caused by vaccinations and vitamin c deficiency may mimic the shaken baby syndrome\\".

This is commonly found in China, Myanmar and India. Mechanism Bamboos usually have a lifecycle around 40 to 80 years, varying among species. Normally, new bamboos grow up from bamboo shoots at the roots. At infrequent intervals for most species, they will start to blossom. After blossom, flowers produce fruit (called \\"bamboo rice\\" in parts of India and China). Following this, the bamboo forest dies out. Since a bamboo forest usually grows from a single bamboo, the death of bamboos occurs in a large area. Close-up of bamboo flowers Phyllostachys glauca 'Yunzhu' flowers Many bamboo species flower at extremely long intervals such as 65 or even 120 years. These taxa exhibit mass flowering (or gregarious flowering), with all plants in a particular cohort flowering over a several-year period. Any plant derived through clonal propagation from this cohort will also flower regardless of whether it has been planted in a different location. The longest mass flowering interval known is 130 years, for the species Phyllostachys bambusoides (Sieb. & Zucc.). In this species, all plants of the same stock flower at the same time, regardless of differences in geographic locations or climatic conditions, and then die. The lack of environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of some sort of \\"alarm clock\\" in each cell of the plant which signals the cessation of vegetative growth and the diversion of all energy to flower production. This mechanism, as well as the evolutionary cause behind it, is still largely a mystery. One hypothesis to explain the evolution of this semelparous mass flowering phenomenon is the predator satiation hypothesis, which argues that by fruiting at the same time, a population increases the survival rate of their seeds by flooding the area with fruit. Therefore, even if predators eat their fill, seeds will still be left over. By having a flowering cycle longer than the lifespan of the rodent predators, bamboos can regulate animal populations by causing starvation during the period between flowering events. Thus, the death of the adult clone is due to resource exhaustion, as it would be more effective for parent plants to devote all resources to creating a large seed crop than to hold back energy for their own regeneration. Another hypothesis, called the fire cycle hypothesis, argues that periodic flowering followed by death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in the habitat, thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow. This argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load, and also a large target for lightning strikes, increasing the likelihood of wildfire. Because bamboos can be aggressive as early successional plants, the seedlings would be able to outstrip other plants and take over the space left by their parents. However, both have been disputed for different reasons. The predator satiation hypothesis does not explain why the flowering cycle is 10 times longer than the lifespan of the local rodents, something not predicted. The bamboo fire cycle hypothesis is considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable; they argue that fires only result from humans and no natural fires occur in India. This notion is considered wrong based on distribution of lightning strike data during the dry season throughout India. However, another argument against this is the lack of precedent for any living organism to harness something as unpredictable as lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part of natural evolutionary progress. Impact The mass fruiting also has direct economic and ecological consequences, however. For example, devastating consequences occur when the Melocanna bambusoides population flowers and fruits once every 30‚Äì35 years around the Bay of Bengal. The death of the bamboo plants following their fruiting means the local people lose their building material, and the large increase in bamboo fruit leads to a rapid increase in rodent populations. As the number of rodents increases, they consume all available food, including grain fields and stored food, sometimes leading to famine. These rats can also carry dangerous diseases, such as typhus, typhoid, and bubonic plague, which can reach epidemic proportions as the rodents increase in number. The relationship between rat populations and bamboo flowering was examined in a 2009 Nova documentary Rat Attack. The sudden death of large areas of bamboo puts pressure on animals that depend on bamboo as a food source, such as the endangered giant panda. Flowering produces large quantities of seeds, typically suspended from the ends of the branches. These seeds give rise to a new generation of plants that may be identical in appearance to those that preceded the flowering, or they may produce new cultivars with different characteristics, such as the presence or absence of striping or other changes in coloration of the culms. Several bamboo species are never known to set seed even when sporadically flowering has been reported. Bambusa vulgaris, Bambusa balcooa, and Dendrocalamus stocksii are common examples of such bamboo.

Page was born in Blackpool. He began his career with Nottinghamshire and Lancashire, for whom he played briefly for the Second XI, though it was with Derbyshire that he was to decide to play first-class cricket. He signed a professional contract in 1964. Page's Derbyshire debut, in June 1964, was a steady one, as he scored 25 and aided team-mate Edwin Smith in a seventh-wicket partnership of 57 against Worcestershire. In August of the same year he scored 112 against Leicestershire at Chesterfield, the first of nine centuries which included a career-best of 162 against LeicestershireLeicestershire v Derbyshire 1969 in 1969. Page also helped the Derbyshire team to the runners-up spot in the Gillette Cup competition of 1969. He remained a first-team choice for Derbyshire until his final match for the first team in August 1975. 1975 was one of six seasons in which he scored more than 1000 runs.Mike Page batting by season Page was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler.

NY 12B is a north‚Äìsouth highway connecting Oneida County in the north to Chenango County in the south, passing through Madison County in between. The southern terminus of NY 12B is at NY 12 in the village of Sherburne. The northern terminus is at NY 5 in the town of New Hartford. In Madison County, NY 12B directly abuts the campus of Colgate University in the village of Hamilton.  Route description  = Sherburne to Madison = Southern terminus of NY 12B in the village of Sherburne, as seen from NY 12 north NY 12B begins at an intersection with NY 12 (North Main Street / Utica Road) in the village of Sherburne. From NY 12, NY 12B proceeds north on North Main Street, while NY 12 proceeds northeast on Utica Road. A mix of residences and businesses parallel NY 12B, which leaves the village for the town of Sherburne to the northwest. NY 12B parallels a railroad line to the north, passing Baldwin Station, where the railroad crosses. The route becomes rural, bending to the north through Sherburne and paralleling the Springfield River. The two-lane rural roadway continues north, crosses the county line into Madison County and entering the village of Earlville. In Earlville, NY 12B doubles as North Main Street, a two-lane residential street that crosses through. After Earlville, NY 12B continues northward into the town of Hamilton, where it becomes a two-lane rural highway once again. After crossing into the town of Lebanon, County Route 77 (CR 77; Middleport Road) intersects in the hamlet of Middleport. Middleport consists of a stretch of residences before NY 12B bends to the northeast and out. Crossing back into Hamilton, NY 12B crosses through the campus of Colgate University and Taylor Lake, before entering the village of Hamilton. In Hamilton, NY 12B gains the name of Broad Street, intersecting with CR 70 (Hamilton Street) before entering downtown as a two-lane commercial street. At the junction with CR 83 (Madison Street) and CR 75 (Lebanon Street), NY 12B turns northward and leaves the village on Utica Street. NY 12B and NY 26 north in Madison from US 20 Re- entering the town of Hamilton, NY 12B proceeds to the northwest alongside Hamilton Municipal Airport. After the airport, NY 12B enters the town of Eaton, where it passes Woodman Pond and enters the hamlet of Pecksport. In Pecksport, NY 12B intersects with the southern terminus of NY 46, where NY 12B bends to the northeast, paralleling CR 81 (Canal Road) and an abandoned canal. The two roads begin to fork in different directions as NY 12B intersects US 20 and NY 26 now in the town of Madison. The three routes become concurrent, turning northeast past Madison Lake. The routes soon enter the hamlet of Madison Center, intersecting with CR 41 (North Street) and CR 83 (South Street). The two-lane residential/commercial street lines Madison Center, leaving before NY 12B and NY 26 fork to the north at a junction in the town of Madison. = Madison to Utica = Continuing north from US 20, NY 12B and NY 26 cross through the town of Madison, paralleling CR 43 (Valley Road) before both cross the county line into Oneida County. Immediately after crossing the county line, NY 12B and NY 26 enter the village of Oriskany Falls and gain the moniker of Madison Street. Passing west of Karl Spooner Memorial Field, NY 12B and NY 26 intersect with CR 3 (Broad Street) just before NY 26 turns west onto Main Street. NY 12B turns to the northeast onto the renamed North Main Street when CR 46 (College Street) continues north on the former right-of-way. Leaving Oriskany Falls, NY 12B loses the North Main moniker and becomes a two- lane rural road through a quarry in the town of Marshall. In Marshall, NY 12B bends to the northeast and away from the quarry, remaining a two-lane road of fields and residences. After a mobile home, NY 12B begins to straighten to the north, entering the hamlet of Marshall, where it becomes a two-lane commercial roadway. In downtown Marshall, NY 12B intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 11 (West Hill Road) and soon the northern terminus of NY 315\\\\. NY 12B becomes residential and leaves the hamlet of Marshall, re-entering the town. Near the intersection with Bougusville Road, the route crosses the town line into Kirkland. NY 12B becomes a two-lane rural highway, bending to the east near an intersection with NY 233 and into the hamlet of Farmers Mill. In Farmers Mill, NY 12B intersects with Dugway Road, where it intersects with CR 16 (Post Street) and into the hamlet of Franklin Springs. NY 12B southbound at the junction with NY 412 west in the village of Clinton After an intersection with Dwight Avenue, NY 12B bends northeast out of the town of Kirkland and into the village of Clinton and gaining the name of Franklin Avenue. In Clinton, NY 12B becomes a two-lane commercial street before intersecting with the eastern terminus of NY 412 (College Street). NY 12B turns east onto College Street, crossing through downtown Clinton until the intersection with CR 17 (Fountain Street). At this junction, NY 12B turns northward on East Park Row, before leaving downtown Clinton to the northeast via Utica Street. The route remains a two-lane residential street, crossing Clinton Village Park before an intersection with CR 15 (Brimfield Street) before re-entering the town of Kirkland. After re-entering Kirkland, NY 12B continues northeast as Utica Street, a two-lane residential street. The route soon bends to the east, intersecting with NY 5B (Limberlost Road), where the two routes become concurrent. A short distance after crossing into the town of New Hartford, NY 5B turns northward onto Middle Settlement Road. NY 12B continues eastward along now-Clinton Road, a two-lane commercial street until the junction with Merritt Place, where the street becomes residential, and bends to the northeast. A short distance after, NY 12B intersects with NY 5 (Seneca Turnpike) near the Yahnundasis Golf Club, which doubles as the former's northern terminus. NY 5 continues east into New Hartford and towards Utica. History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 8, an unsigned legislative route extending from the city of Binghamton to Kirkland. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of Route 8 between Chenango Forks and Clinton became part of NY 12, which continued northeast through Clinton to Utica. The portion of NY 12 between Sherburne and Utica was realigned in 1928 to follow a new, more direct alignment to the east. The former routing of NY 12 between the two locations was redesignated as NY 12A. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 12A was renumbered to NY 12B. The section of NY 12B between Earlville and Hamilton has historically been susceptible to accidents. According to a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), 93 accidents occurred along this portion of NY 12B from November 2006 to October 2009. Of those, 50 were the result of striking an animal while 15 others were cases where a motorist crashed into a fixed object. Area residents and officials had asked NYSDOT to lower the speed limit on the highway from to ; however, this request was denied in July 2010. Instead, NYSDOT will look into improving specific areas along the highway where accidents are more common.

Early life and playing career Beinfest was born in Encino, California, and raised in Chatsworth, California. Playing baseball at Chatsworth High School, Beinfest made the varsity as a sophomore, the only one on rookie Coach Bob Lofrano's squad. By the end of the season, Beinfest was Lofrano's starting shortstop. The next year, as captain, Beinfest led Chatsworth to its first league title since 1972, its first of nine in a row. Beinfest batted .364, was exceptional in the field, an All-Los Angeles selection as a shortstop, and shared West Valley League MVP honors in 1982 with two-time MLB Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen.Los Angeles Times, \\"Where Are They Now?: Larry Beinfest\\" The turning point of Beinfest's athletic career came in the seventh inning of the 1981 City Section quarterfinals at West Los Angeles College, when a Grant High baserunner roll-blocked Beinfest's leg, breaking it in two places. Beinfest writhed in pain as rescue crews delayed in reaching him, argued with one another, and eventually took him to the wrong hospital. After nine days in the hospital and three months of lugging a bulky full-leg cast around, Beinfest ended up with a permanently shorter left leg. Before his injury, Beinfest had numerous recruiting letters from baseball powers like Stanford, UCLA and Arizona State. After his injury, interest waned, even as Beinfest came back strong in 1982, batting .349, leading Chatsworth to another league title and another trip to the City semifinals, and sharing the league MVP award with Saberhagen. Beinfest accepted the only Division I scholarship offered to him, a free ride to Nevada-Reno. He tore up the Northern California Baseball Association his freshman year, batting .375 and earning rookie of the year and all-conference honors. But in 1984, shuttling between shortstop and third base, his average dropped, and he relinquished his dreams of playing professional baseball. After his sophomore season, he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he failed to make the baseball team. Beinfest graduated from Berkeley in 1986 with a degree in international business and finance. He spent a year working for an area radio station selling air time and then set off for Syracuse University where he would earn a Master's degree in Public Communications, envisioning a career in sports broadcasting. Those plans changed a few months after graduation when the Seattle Mariners offered him a job in their front office. Early front office career In 1989, Beinfest began his career in Major League Baseball as a Player Development and Scouting Assistant in the minor league operations of the Seattle Mariners. He helped coordinate the Mariners' farm system, organized spring training, and dealt with equipment problems, medical arrangements, and scouting schedules. The Mariners promoted Beinfest to Assistant Director of Player Development in 1994. Starting in 1996, Beinfest climbed his way up through the Mariners' front office receiving promotions in three straight years. He became the Mariners' Minor League Director in 1996, Director of Player Development in 1997, and then Assistant to the Vice President of Baseball Operations in 1998. In 2000, Beinfest joined the Montreal Expos as its Assistant General Manager. He held that position for two years and served as the Interim General Manager of the Expos from October 2001 to February 2002.Baseball America, Executive Database General manager of Marlins Following an ownership change, the then-Florida Marlins, led by new owner Jeffrey Loria, hired Beinfest as its general manager and senior vice president on February 12, 2002.Baseball America, Executive Database Through a number of trades and free agent acquisitions, Beinfest built upon the Marlins' existing foundation of young talent and improved the roster into an eventual World Series champion in 2003. In 2002, Beinfest traded for Dontrelle Willis, who would become the 2003 NL Rookie of the Year. Prior to the 2003 season, Beinfest acquired Juan Pierre, who would later be named the team's most valuable player that year, and also signed catcher Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, who would lead the Marlins in RBI in the 2003 Playoffs. On May 11, 2003, Beinfest replaced manager Jeff Torborg with Jack McKeon. The Marlins went 75-49 under McKeon's leadership, finished with a final record of 91-71, and made the playoffs by clinching the NL Wild Card. Before the 2003 trade deadline, Beinfest made two key trades that strengthened the Marlins for its championship run. He traded for then-American League saves leader and closer Ugueth Urbina, who recorded saves in Games 1 and 5 of the 2003 World Series. And after third baseman Mike Lowell broke his left hand on August 30, Beinfest acquired Jeff Conine just before the midnight deadline on August 31, 2003. The Marlins defeated the San Francisco Giants, 3-1 in four games in the 2003 NLDS, and the Chicago Cubs, 4-3 in seven games in the 2003 NLCS, to win the 2003 NL Pennant. In the 2003 World Series, the Marlins became the champion of Major League Baseball by defeating the AL Pennant winning New York Yankees 4-2 in six games. Following their championship season, Baseball America named the Marlins Organization of the Year and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum recognized Beinfest as the 2003 winner of the Rube Foster Legacy Award for NL Executive of the Year. Prior to the 2006 season, Beinfest re-tooled the Marlins' roster by acquiring numerous talented young players via trades, the Rule 5 draft, and free agency. He traded for Hanley Ram√≠rez, An√≠bal S√°nchez, Ricky Nolasco and others. Ramirez went on to become the 2006 NL Rookie of the Year, the second NL Rookie of the Year Beinfest has acquired via trade during his tenure (also Willis in 2003). Sanchez tossed the fourth no-hitter in Marlins' history on September 6, 2006 blanking the Arizona Diamondbacks at then Dolphin Stadium. Sanchez was also one of four rookie pitchers on the Marlins to win 10+ games in 2006, along with Nolasco, Josh Johnson, and Scott Olsen, making the Marlins the first team ever to have four rookie pitchers record 10 wins in a season. Beinfest selected Dan Uggla in the December 2005 Rule 5 draft. In 2006, Uggla established the Major League record for home runs by a rookie second baseman and became the first player in Major League history to be selected to the MLB All Star Game the season after he was taken in the Rule 5 draft. Uggla was honored as the NL's Most Outstanding Rookie by Major League Baseball's players. During Beinfest's tenure, the Marlins have posted all but one of their top single-season win totals (91 in 2003, 2nd; 87 in 2009, 3rd; 84 in 2008, 4th; and 83 in 2004 and 2005, tied for 5th). President, Baseball Operations On September 29, 2007, the Marlins promoted Beinfest to President, Baseball Operations.USA Today, \\"Marlins promote Beinfest to president, Hill to GM\\" During the 2008 season, Beinfest signed Hanley Ram√≠rez to a six-year $70 million contract extension that runs through 2014 and was the richest contract in Marlins' franchise history until the Jose Reyes signing on December 7, 2011.ESPN, \\"Source: Ramirez agrees to six-year, $70 million contract with Marlins\\" Following the 2009 season, Chris Coghlan, whom Beinfest drafted in the first round of the 2006 First-Year Player Draft, won the 2009 NL Rookie of the Year award and became the third player acquired by Beinfest to win the award.Miami Herald, \\"Florida Marlins' Chris Coghlan wins NL Rookie of the Year\\" On January 14, 2010, Beinfest and the Marlins reached an agreement with Josh Johnson on a four-year $39 million contract that is the most lucrative contract for a pitcher in Marlins' history and the first multi-year contract for a Marlins pitcher since Loria became owner in 2002.ESPN, \\"Johnson agrees to deal with Marlins\\" Reputation Beinfest is widely regarded as one of the best executives in Major League Baseball because he consistently works with one of the league's lowest player payrolls and fields a competitive team, having a World Series title and five winning seasons in the past seven.ESPN, Peter Gammons, \\"It's not all doom and gloom in South Florida\\"The Baseball Analysts, \\"MLB Payroll Efficiency 2006-2008\\"Washington Post, \\"Marlins Getting Most Bang for Their Buck: Financially Challenged Team Consistently Does More With Less to Remain Competitive\\"ESPN, Peter Gammons, \\"Marlins aren't your typical small-market team\\"Bleacher Report, \\"Here's a Thought: Marlins GM Larry Beinfest is a Genius\\" Beinfest is credited for his strong ability to identify the players he wants and work with executives from their organizations to complete a deal.

The upper diagram shows a pull-fuze screwed into a secondary fuze well in the side of the mine. Additionally, an M5 anti-lift device has been screwed into another fuze well, hidden under the mine. An inexperienced deminer might detect and render safe the pull-fuze, but then be killed when he lifted the mine, triggering the M5 pressure-release firing device underneath. The lower diagram shows two anti-tank landmines connected by a cord attached to the upper mine's carrying handle. The cord is attached to a pull fuze installed in a secondary fuze well in the bottom mine. An anti-handling device is an attachment to or an integral part of a landmine or other munition such as some fuze types found in general-purpose air-dropped bombs, cluster bombs and sea mines. It is designed to prevent tampering or disabling, or to target bomb disposal personnel. When the protected device is disturbed, it detonates, killing or injuring anyone within the blast area. There is a strong functional overlap of booby traps and anti-handling devices.  Purpose  Anti-handling devices prevent the capture and reuse of the munition by enemy forces. They also hinder bomb disposal or demining operations, both directly and by deterrence, thereby creating a much more effective hazard or barrier. Anti-handling devices greatly increase the danger of munitions to civilian populations in the areas in which they are used because their mechanisms are so easily triggered. An anti-tank mine with an anti-handling device fitted is almost guaranteed to detonate if it is lifted/overturned, because it is specifically designed to do so. Munitions fitted with anti-handling devices increase the difficulty and cost of post-conflict clearing operations, due to the inherent dangers of attempting to render them safe. Not all munitions will have an anti-handling device. Perhaps one in ten antitank mines in a large defensive minefield will have boobytrap firing devices screwed into their secondary fuze wells. Even so, deminers and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel are forced to assume that all items they encounter may have been boobytrapped, and must therefore take extra precautions. This has the effect of significantly slowing down the clearance process.  History  M4 anti- tank mine dating from circa 1945, showing two additional fuze wells designed for use with booby-trap firing devices. Either or both fuze wells may have firing devices screwed into them if required A stack of five M15 mines dating from the 1960s. The top two mines show additional fuze wells M19 anti- tank mine, dating from the 1970s showing an additional fuze well on the side of the mine (sealing cap has been removed) designed for use with booby-trap firing devices. There is another empty fuze well (not visible) located underneath the mine Anti-handling mechanisms have been used in fuzes since at least 1940, in, for example, Luftwaffe's ZUS-40 anti-removal fuze which was used during the London Blitz and elsewhere. ZUS-40s were designed to fit underneath most Luftwaffe bomb fuzes. When a delayed-action bomb containing a ZUS-40 was dropped on a target, the impact when it hit the ground freed a ball-bearing inside the ZUS-40, thereby arming a spring-loaded firing pin. However, so long as the main bomb fuze remained inside its fuze well, the cocked firing pin in the ZUS-40 was prevented from springing forward. ZUS-40s were often fitted underneath a type 17 clockwork long delay fuze, which gave between 2 and 72 hours delayed detonation. Rendering safe a type 17 fuze was normally a simple and straightforward process i.e. unscrew the fuze locking ring, remove the fuze from its pocket in the side of the bomb and unscrew the gaine. However, fitting a ZUS-40 underneath a type 17 fuze made the render- safe process much more complicated and dangerous. Removing the main time-delay fuze more than 15 millimetres from its fuze pocket (without neutralising the anti-handling device underneath) automatically released the cocked firing pin inside the ZUS-40, which sprang forward to strike a large percussion cap, thereby causing detonation of the bomb and the death of anyone nearby. Because the ZUS-40 was designed to be concealed underneath a conventional bomb fuze, it was very difficult to know whether a particular bomb was fitted with an anti-handling device or not. In any case, many electrically fired German bomb fuzes already had a pendulum-based \\"trembler\\" switch which triggered detonation if the bomb was subjected to rough handling. Some German anti- handling fuzes were even more dangerous to EOD personnel, such as the type 50 and 50BY fuzes. These were normally fitted to 250/500 kg bombs and contained two mercury tilt switches which detected vertical or horizontal movement. The fuzes fully armed themselves approximately 30 seconds after hitting the ground. Subsequently, if the bomb was moved in any way, the mercury switch triggered detonation. To complicate matters still further, German bombs could have two separate fuze pockets fitted, with different fuze types screwed into each one. As a result, one bomb could incorporate two separate anti-handling devices working independently of each other e.g. a type 17 clockwork fuze with a ZUS-40 hidden underneath it screwed into one fuze pocket, and a type 50BY in the other. Even comparatively small air-dropped munitions could incorporate an anti-handling feature e.g. the type 70 fuze fitted to Butterfly bombs. However, fuzes with an integral anti-handling feature were not only found in air-dropped bombs. For example, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze (dating from 1943) fitted to Teller mines automatically triggered detonation if (in an attempt to render the mine safe) the pressure plate was unscrewed. Although the designs of these anti-handling fuzes varied, all were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel who had the task of rendering them safe. Allied forces developed their own designs of anti-handling devices during World War II. For example, the American M123A1, M124A1, M125 and M131 series of chemical long delay tail-fuzes which were used in air-dropped bombs, starting around late 1942 and remaining in service until the 1960s. Frequently fitted to M64 (500 lb), M65 (1000 lb) and M66 (2000 lb) general-purpose bombs, these fuzes were primarily designed to operate as chemical long-delay fuzes, with settings ranging between 15 minutes and 144 hours. The time delay mechanism was simple but effective: after being dropped from the aircraft a small propellor at the rear of the bomb revolved, gradually screwing a metal rod into the fuze, crushing an ampoule of acetone solvent contained within it. When this happened the fuze was fully armed and the timer countdown had started. The acetone soaked into an absorbent pad next to a celluloid disk which held back a spring-loaded firing pin from a percussion cap connected to an adjacent detonator. Acetone slowly dissolved the celluloid disk, gradually weakening it until the cocked firing pin was released and the bomb detonated. The time delay of the fuze varied according to the acetone concentration and the thickness of the celluloid disk. Removing a chemical long delay fuze from a bomb after it had been dropped would have been a straightforward process had it not been for the fact that there was an integral anti-withdrawal mechanism designed to kill anyone who tried to render the bomb safe. Fuzes such as the M123 (and its derivatives) contained two small ball-bearings at the lower end which slid out of recesses when the fuze was screwed into the bomb by aircraft armorers. The ball-bearings jammed into the screw-threads inside the fuze well, preventing the fuze from being removed. Because the lower end of the fuze was locked in place deep inside the bomb (where it was hard to get at) this posed major problems for enemy EOD personnel. Attempting to unscrew a fully armed chemical long-delay fuze caused it to split into two separate fuze assemblies. This action automatically triggered detonation by releasing the cocked firing pin in the lower fuze assembly, with lethal results for anyone nearby. Unexploded bombs dating from World War II with chemical long-delay fuzes fitted remain extremely hazardous to EOD personnel. Corrosion makes the fuze mechanism more sensitive to disturbance. There is a high risk that any movement will either reactivate the timer mechanism or immediately release the firing pin. Typically, this happens when the bomb is first discovered on a construction site (e.g. accidentally scraping against the bomb with a backhoe), or whilst it is being examined by EOD personnel e.g. gently rotating the bomb casing to gain better access to the rear end. One of these scenarios occurred in June 2010, when an unexploded 500 kilogram allied bomb fitted with a chemical long-delay fuze killed three German EOD personnel and wounded six others in G√∂ttingen, whilst they were preparing to render it safe. Another allied bomb fitted with a chemical long-delay fuze was discovered in Munich during August 2012, and had to be detonated in situ (shattering windows over a wide area and causing major damage to surrounding buildings) because it was considered too dangerous to disarm. The British \\"Number 37 Long Delay Pistol\\" (used by RAF Bomber Command during World War II) was another chemical long delay fuze which used a very similar type of anti-removal mechanism. A later design of British nose fuze called the number 845 Mk 2 operated purely in anti-disturbance mode. It contained a mercury switch which triggered detonation if the bomb was moved after a 20-second arming delay, which started when the bomb hit the ground. Since then, many nations have produced a wide variety of munitions with fuzes which incorporate some form of anti-handling function, including very small weapons such as cluster bombs. Alternatively, they have produced munitions with features which make it very easy to add an anti-tamper function e.g. extra (but empty) threaded fuze wells on anti-tank landmines, into which the detonators on booby-trap firing devices (plus booster attachments) can be screwed.  Classes  US Army field manual FM 20‚Äì32 classifies four classes of anti-handling devices: * Anti-lifting devices. A device which initiates an explosion when a protected mine is lifted or pulled out of its hole. * Anti-disturbance device. A device which initiates an explosion when a protected mine is lifted, tilted or disturbed in any way e.g. a notable variant of the VS-50 mine featuring an integral mercury switch. * Anti-defuzing device. A device which initiates an explosion when an attempt is made to remove a fuze from a protected mine. * Anti-disarming device. A device which initiates an explosion when an attempt is made to set the arming mechanism of a mine to safe.  Types of anti-handling fuzes  The different classes of anti-handling devices are normally created using a variety of fuzes. This is a list of the types of fuzes used as anti-handling devices: * Pull fuzes ‚Äî these are typically installed in secondary fuze wells located on the side or bottom of landmines. The fuze is normally connected to a thin wire attached to the ground, so the wire is automatically pulled if the mine is lifted, shifted or disturbed in any way. Simple pull-fuzes release a spring- loaded striker. More sophisticated versions are electronic i.e. feature a break-wire sensor which detects a drop in voltage. Either way, pulling on the hidden wire triggers detonation. * Anti-lifting fuzes ‚Äî these are frequently screwed into an auxiliary fuze pocket located underneath anti-tank landmines. The act of lifting or shifting the mine releases a cocked striker, triggering detonation. The M5 universal firing device is a classic example of an anti- lift fuze. Its standard gauge screw thread allows it to be fitted to various munition types, ranging from an M26 hand grenade up to an M15 antitank landmine. * Tilt/vibration switches ‚Äî this is a fuze installed inside the device which triggers detonation if the sensor is tilted beyond a certain angle or is subject to any vibration. Typically, some form of pendulum arrangement, spring-loaded \\"trembler\\" or mercury switch is used to detect this. * Anti-mine detector fuzes ‚Äî developed during the Second World War to detect the magnetic field of mine detectors. * Electronic fuzes ‚Äî modern electronic fuzes may incorporate anti-handling features. Typically, these fuzes incorporate one or more of the following sensors: seismic, magnetic, light sensitive, thermal or acoustic sensitive. Potentially, such fuzes can discriminate between various types of mine clearance operations i.e. resist activation by devices such as mine flails, plows, or explosives, whilst still detonating when handled by demining personnel. Additionally, electronic fuzes may have an inbuilt self-destruct capability i.e. some form of timer countdown designed to trigger detonation hours, days or even months after deployment, possibly whilst people are attempting to render the device safe. Although fuzes with a self-destruct capability are not anti-handling devices per se, they do add an extra complicating factor to the EOD process.

He was employed as a clerk until 1826 when he engaged in mercantile pursuits. He assisted in establishing the Bank of Albion in 1839 and served as cashier. He was Treasurer of Orleans County in 1840 and was Assignee in bankruptcy for Orleans County in 1841. He was Supervisor of the Town of Barre in 1845, and was elected as a Whig to the 31st and 32nd United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1849 to March 4, 1853. In August 1852, he declined to be appointed United States Postmaster General by President Millard Fillmore. Instead, Fillmore (a fellow New York Whig) chose Connecticut Whig Samuel Dickinson Hubbard. He was eighteenth New York State Comptroller from 1856 to 1857, elected on the American Party ticket in 1855. He won 33.98% of the vote over the Republican, and the two Democrats.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=574687 He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York on the American Party ticket in 1858. Unlike three years previously, where he won with slightly over a third of the vote, he only narrowly got over ten percent this election while both the reunited Democratic Party and the recently established Republican Party both won over forty percent.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=107100 He was director of the Niagara Falls International Bridge Co. He was chosen as a regent of New York University in 1858 and appointed one of the commissioners of Mount Albion Cemetery in 1862, serving in both of these capacities until his death in 1885. He was buried at Mount Albion. His uncle Daniel Burrows was a United States Representative from Connecticut. His brother Latham A. Burrows was a New York State Senator. Both served in Congress or in the state legislature in the 1820s.

Its methods correspond to the alchemy familiar in the Mediterranean and Western European worlds. Rasashastra is a pharmaceutical branch of Indian system of medicine which mainly deals with the metals, minerals, animal origin product, toxic herbs and their use in therapeutics.  History of development of Rasa ≈öƒÅstra  The credit of developing Rasa Shastara as a stream of classical Ayurveda, especially in fulfilling its healthcare-related goals, goes to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna (5the Century CE).  Classical textbooks on rasa shastra  = Rasendra Mangala = It was composed by NƒÅgƒÅrjuna Siddha in the Sanskrit language. P. C. R√¢y considered this work (which he erroneously called RasaratnƒÅkara) to be amongst the earliest surviving alchemical works, perhaps from as early as the 7th or 8th century. Rasendramangala originally comprised eight chapters, only four of which are found in the manuscripts available today. Manuscripts of the work are found at Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar, at Rajasthan Prachya Vidya Pratishthan, Govt. office Bikaner and elsewhere. An edition and translation was published in 2003. = Rasa Hridaya Tantra = It was created by Shrimad Govind Bhagvatapad, guru of Shankaracharya, around the 7th century. It contains elaborate description of dhatuvada ( metallurgical processes to transform mercury into higher metals as gold or silver). A Sanskrit commentary on this text was contributed by Shri Chaturbhuj Mishra under the name of Mugdhavabodhini. = Rasarnava = Edited and published in 1908‚Äì1910. = Rasa Prakasha Sudhakara = Acharya Yadavji Trikam on a 2019 stamp of India It is a 13th-century text by Acharya Yashodhar Bhatt. It was first published by Acharya Yadavji Trikam in 1910. Its second edition was published in 1912 under guidance of Shri Jivaram Kalidas Vyas. It contains 13 chapters describing both Lauhavad (use of metallurgical processes to convert lower metals to higher metals), and Chikitsavad ( use of metals and minerals for therapeutic use). It also describes the origin of mercury,its properties, 18 samskaras (processing techniques) of mercury as well as the tools and techniques involved in them. = Rasendra Chudamani = It was created by Aacharya Somadeva approximately in 12th‚Äì13th century. It contains 13 chapters which give elaborate description of mercury and its processing for medicinal use; definition and description of equipments and Puta (temperature requirements and regulation during processing). It can be inferred that at the time of its creation the Gurukula system of education was prevalent as it contains description about Shishyopnayana samskara ( ritual performed at the time of admission ). Specific contribution of this text include high degree of organization followed during compilation and description of 64 divya-aushadis (drugs with miraculous effect) for the very first time. = Rasa Ratna Samuccaya = It was created by VƒÅgbha·π≠a, son of Vaidyapati Si·πÉhagupta, around the end of the 13th century or beginning of the 14th century. It contains around 30 chapters. It is considered one of the best treatises written in the field of Rasa Shastra. It contains vivid description of Yantras (tools, equipments), Puta (temperature related processing details), classification of metals and minerals into Rasa, Uprasa, Lauha, Dhatu, Updhatu etc. as well as their processing details. It also describes clinical aspects of Rasa aushadhis. However, it is not considered as an original text. Rather it is considered as a compilation of works of other Acharyas. Though it may contain some original work of Vagbhatta, but it is difficult to differentiate. It derives much of its contributions from Rasendrachudamani of Somadeva. Rasaprabha and Vijnanbodhini are two of the Hindi commentaries available. Saralarthprakashini is one of the Sanskrit commentary available by Sriyut Shastri Khare. Methods The methods of rasa shastra are contained in a number of Ayurvedic texts, including the Charaka Samhita and Susruta Samhita. An important feature is the use of metals, including several that are considered to be toxic in evidence-based medicine. In addition to mercury, gold, silver, iron, copper, tin, lead, zinc and bell metal are used. In addition to these metals, salts and other substances such as coral, seashells, and feathers are also used.Mishra, p. 86 The usual means used to administer these substances is by preparations called bhasma, Sanskrit for \\"ash\\". Calcination, which is described in the literature of the art as shodhana, \\"purification\\", is the process used to prepare these bhasma for administration. Sublimation and the preparation of a mercury sulfide are also in use in the preparation of its materia medica. A variety of methods are used to achieve this. One involves the heating of thin sheets of metal and then immersing them in oil (taila), extract (takra), cow urine (gomutra) and other substances.Mishra, pp. 86‚Äì88 Others are calcined in crucibles heated with fires of cow dung (puttam).Mishra, pp. 87‚Äì88 Ayurvedic practitioners believe that this process of purification removes undesirable qualities and enhances their therapeutic power.Mishra, pp. 88 Toxicity Modern medicine finds that mercury is inherently toxic, and that its toxicity is not due to the presence of impurities. While mercury does have anti-microbial properties, and used to be widely used in Western medicine, its toxicity does not warrant the risk of using it as a health product in most circumstances.Toxicological Profile for Mercury. U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. March 1999 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also reported a number of cases of lead poisoning associated with Ayurvedic medicine. Other incidents of heavy metal poisoning have been attributed to the use of rasa shastra compounds in the United States, and arsenic has also been found in some of the preparations, which have been marketed in the United States under trade names such as \\"AyurRelief\\", \\"GlucoRite\\", \\"Acnenil\\", \\"Energize\\", \\"Cold Aid\\", and \\"Lean Plus\\".Hammett-Stabler, Catherine A. (2011) Herbal Supplements: Efficacy, Toxicity, Interactions with Western Drugs, and Effects on Clinical Laboratory Tests. John Wiley and Sons. pp. 202‚Äì205. Ayurvedic practitioners claim that these reports of toxicity are due to failure to follow traditional practices in the mass production of these preparations for sale,Hammett-Stabler, Catherine A. (2011) Herbal Supplements: Efficacy, Toxicity, Interactions with Western Drugs, and Effects on Clinical Laboratory Tests. John Wiley and Sons. pp. 205‚Äì206. but modern science finds that not only mercury, but also lead is inherently toxic. The government of India has ordered that Ayurvedic products must specify their metallic content directly on the labels of the product; however, M. S. Valiathan noted that \\"the absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities [in India] make the quality control of Ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult at this time.

Thompson was born in Ireland and emigrated to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. During the French and Indian War, Thompson served as a captain in the Kittanning Expedition under John Armstrong. After news of the Battle of Bunker Hill reached Pennsylvania in 1775, Thompson was appointed colonel of a rifle battalion and was sent to Massachusetts to help in the defense of Boston. His unit was known as Thompson's Pennsylvania Rifle Battalion, or the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment. After Thompson's company of Pennsylvania sharpshooters drove back a British landing-party on November 9, 1775, he was made a brigadier-general, to the displeasure of George Washington, who had reservations about Thompson's abilities. Sent to reinforce American troops in Canada, Thompson was captured during an attack on the enemy at Trois-Rivi√®res in Quebec on June 8, 1776. He was paroled, but not exchanged for four years, and so he could not reenter military service. Thompson blamed Congressman Thomas McKean for hindering his exchange; his criticism became so harsh that he was censured by Congress. McKean successfully sued Thompson for libel. Thompson married Catherine Ross, sister of George Ross, signer of the Declaration of Independence for Pennsylvania. While on parole in Philadelphia on December 17, 1778 he became an early Member of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick History of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and of the Hibernian Society for the Relief of Emigrants from Ireland: March 17, 1771-March 17, 1892..

It has rough, flaky or fibrous bark on part or all of the trunk, smooth greyish to yellowish bark above. The adult leaves are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the flower buds are arranged in groups of seven and the fruit is more or less hemispherical. Description Eucalyptus melliodora is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is variable ranging from smooth with an irregular, short stocking, to covering most of the trunk, fibrous, dense or loosely held, grey, yellow or red-brown, occasionally very coarse, thick, dark brown to black. The smooth bark above is shed from the upper limbs to leave a smooth, white or yellowish surface. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped to elliptic leaves that are long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same dull light green or slate grey on both surfaces, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The vein on the leaf margin of both adult and juvenile leaves is markedly distant from the leaf margin.Brooker & Kleinig, Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Reed Books, Melbourne, 1996 The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped, oval or diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical to shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the fruit near or below rim level. Taxonomy Eucalyptus melliodora was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham and the description was published in Walper's bookRepertorium Botanices Systematicae. Distribution and habitat Yellow box is widely distributed on the eastern plains and tablelands from western Victoria, New South Wales and up from the capital territory to south-central Queensland. Ecology It is associated with inland grey box, fuzzy box (E. conica), white box (E. albens), pilliga grey box (E. pilligaensis), red ironbark (E. sideroxylon), narrow- leaved ironbark (E. crebra), Blakely's red gum (E. blakelyi), apple species (Angophora), black cypress (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress (Callitris glaucophylla), kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus) and wattles (Acacia) species. Uses Eucalyptus melliodora is considered to be the best native tree for honey production. The honey produced has a delightful golden colour and an excellent taste. The timber is pale brown, dense and heavy (about 1100 kg/m3), resistant to decay and has been used for sleepers, posts, poles and bridges. It is not known as a furniture timber.

HC08's are fully code-compatible with their predecessors, the Motorola 68HC05. Like all Motorola processors that share lineage from the 6800, they use the von Neumann architecture as well as memory-mapped I/O. This family has five CPU registers that are not part of the memory. One 8-bit accumulator A, a 16-bit index register H:X, a 16-bit stack pointer SP, a 16-bit program counter PC, and an 8-bit condition code register CCR. Some instructions refer to the different bytes in the H:X index register independently. Among the HC08's there are dozens of processor families, each targeted to different embedded applications. Features and capabilities vary widely, from 8 to 64-pin processors, from LIN connectivity to USB 1.1. A typical and general purpose device from the HC08 family of units is the microcontroller M68HC908GP32. The Freescale RS08 core is a simplified, \\"reduced-resource\\" version of the HC08.

The protests were organized in opposition to government plans to partially infill the bay and build a new power plant. It resulted in the shooting deaths of several villagers in the night of 6 December 2005 by People's Armed Police. The death toll is unknown, with different sources mentioning anywhere from three to several dozen deaths. The protests resumed in November 2006. Incident The protests were held because local farmers were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation for land expropriated for the construction of the plant. They are also reportedly concerned with the potential for harmful pollution affecting their crops, while fishermen felt their livelihood would be adversely affected by the modifications to the bay. According to Xinhua, the Information Office of the government of Shanwei described the incident as \\"serious violation of law\\", in which Huang Xijun, Lin Hanru and Huang Xirang led protesters in attacking police with knives, petrol bombs, and other explosive devices. Xinhua reported that the police fired warning shots but, in the confusion after nightfall, people were hit by mistake. Local villagers denied these accounts, reported that the protesters may have used ordinary fireworks as part of their protest. Villagers also alleged that the authorities had \\"enlisted thugs from local organized crime groups to help put down the demonstration\\" in addition to regular security forces. The village was sealed off by government forces who are searching for suspects involved in the violence and preventing people from leaving the village. Casualties The official New China News Agency stated that three people had been killed and eight others injured, but there are other reports that quoted villagers saying as many as 20 people had been killed. There were reports that local authorities refused to return bodies to families, in some cases offering money to villagers instead so that they would stop asking for the bodies. It was also reported that on 9 December, many villagers held incense sticks and knelt in front of police barricades in the village, asking for the bodies of their loved ones for proper burial. These requests were refused. The South China Morning Post quoted some residents who said that the officials were attempting to hide the death toll. Aftermath On 11 December 2005, the Chinese government announced that a police commander was detained for mishandling the protest and causing deaths and injuries. Ta Kung Pao reported on 13 December that, according to the Shanwei TV Station via Agence France Presse, Wu Sheng, the vice director of the Shanwei Police Department, was placed in criminal detention by procurator bureau for mishandling the event. According to local television via The Washington Post, nine residents were also arrested. So far, the news has been followed closely by Hong Kong, Taiwan, dissident Chinese, and overseas media, but has received lesser coverage in mainland China media. In June 2006, The New York Times reported that 19 villagers had been prosecuted for the unrest, 7 being given long sentences for disturbing public order and using explosives against the Police. This was taken to be evidence of the Chinese government covering up the true nature of the shootings. The trial was not widely reported on and locals said that they were constantly being pressured not to talk about what happened in 2005. Construction work resumed on the plant after the protests ended, with no compensation being handed out. No public investigation of the shootings has been carried out either. In November 2006, the BBC reported that tension was again mounting in Dongzhou. The report stated that residents had taken eight local officials hostage after a villager was detained. Two days later, Radio Free Asia reported that the officials had been released following a dawn raid by police, but more villagers had been detained. Shortly after, a similar event took place at another village in Guangdong, where villagers attempted to detain officials in a dispute over compensation for loss of farm land. Clearly the events in Dongzhou are not an isolated case but part of an ongoing wave of protests against land grabs in China, which Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has acknowledged is an \\"historic error\\".

They came to international attention in 2007 with the release of Are We Not Horses, a critically acclaimed science fiction concept album about six-legged robotic horses in the midst of an existential crisis. They have been on hiatus since 2010. History Novelist Chris Eaton began performing and recording under the moniker Rock Plaza Central in the late 1990s. In 1997 he released a debut album, Quantum Butterass, backed by members of Toronto band People From Earth. For the next six years, Eaton performed with a series of mostly improvised bands, often inviting other musicians to join him onstage at the last minute. In August 2003 at a show at Sneaky Dee's in Toronto, Eaton invited old friend Don Murray to join him on mandolin and trumpet, as well as drummer Blake Howard (Guh, Slow Loris, Quadruped), accordionist and trumpeter John Whytock (Arrogant Worms), bassist Scott Maynard and multi-instrumentalist Rob Carson (both from The Quiet Revolution, but previously with By Divine Right and with Selina Martin). The line-up had such good chemistry that Eaton invited them to join the band permanently. At only their third meeting, they travelled to the House of Miracles to record The World Was Hell to Us with Andy Magoffin, with songs that were entirely unrehearsed and mostly recorded live from the floor as first takes. The following year the band invited violinist Fiona Stewart from Reflectiostack to join them. Persisting in their strategy of never rehearsing, they played a monthly residency at the Tranzac Club, where Eaton gradually introduced into the band's repertoire a series of new songs about six-legged robotic horses struggling with their identities in the aftermath of a war between humans and angels. These songs would eventually become Are We Not Horses, their breakthrough album recorded with Dale Morningstar at the Gas Station in 2006. Critical reception for the record was extremely positive, with accolades coming from Pitchfork, americanaUK, and Magnet, who called it ‚Äú2007‚Äôs finest folk/rock find.‚Äù In early 2007, the group also received considerable attention for their cover of the Justin Timberlake song ‚ÄúSexyBack‚Äù. They soon signed to Yep Roc and to Outside Music. From 2007 through 2009, the band toured extensively, performing alongside acts such as The Apples in Stereo, Calexico, Stephen Malkmus, The Mountain Goats, Sloan, and The Weakerthans. During this time, Carson, Whytock, and Howard all had to step away from the band to varying degrees, with drummer Andrew Innanen often joining the four remaining members on tour. In 2009, the band released another well received album, ‚Ä¶At the Moment of Our Most Needing. Since going on hiatus in 2010, the band‚Äôs music was used extensively in the indie zombie film The Battery. Frontman Chris Eaton is also the author of three novels, The Inactivist (2003), The Grammar Architect (2005), and Chris Eaton, a biography that have been studied on several university courses across North America. He published a fourth novel Symphony No. 3 in 2019. Letters To Thomas Pynchon is a short fiction collection published as an eBook with Joyland: A hub for short fiction.

It has rough, stringy or fibrous bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth greyish bark on the thinnest branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven to fifteen or more, white flowers and cup-shaped or barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus obliqua is a tree that typically grows to a height of or sometimes a mallee and forms a lignotuber. The trunk is up to in diameter and has thick, rough, stringy or fibrous bark. Branches more than in diameter have stringy bark and thinner branches have smooth greenish or greyish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green, broadly egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and fifteen or more on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. The tallest known specimen in Tasmania is tall. Trees up to tall have been recorded.Carder, A. 2005: Giant Trees of Western America and The World. Harbour Publishing, Madeira Park, Canada. Taxonomy Eucalyptus obliqua was collected in 1777 by David Nelson and William Anderson during Cook's third expedition. The collections were made at Adventure Bay on Bruny Island in what is now Tasmania. The specimens were sent to the British Museum in London, where they were examined by Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle. L'H√©ritier recognised the specimens as belonging to a new genus which he called Eucalyptus and gave the name Eucalyptus obliqua to the species. The type species is therefore E. obliqua. L'H√©ritier published the first formal description in 1789 in his book Sertum Anglicum. The specific epithet (obliqua) is from the Latin obliquus (\\"oblique\\"), in reference to the leaf bases of unequal length. Distribution and habitat E. obliqua is widespread in cooler areas of south eastern Australia. It occurs from Kangaroo Island, through southeast South Australia, throughout Victoria and Tasmania, mainly east of the tablelands in New South Wales, with a few populations extending into southern Queensland. Thus the overall range of latitude is 28‚Äì43¬Ω¬∞S. It occurs from sea level up to elevations of 1475 metres in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The climate is humid or subhumid, with temperatures ranging from cool to warm, and annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 2400 millimetres. Severe winter frosts are common, severe drought extremely uncommon. It occurs on a wide range of soils in hilly or mountainous areas. In cool mountainous areas it forms tall open-forest with other Eucalyptus species such as E. fastigata (brown barrel), E. nitens (shining gum), E. cypellocarpa (mountain grey gum), E. viminalis (manna gum) and E. delegatensis (alpine ash). Uses One of the most important Australian hardwoods, E. obliqua is often sold with E. regnans (Mountain Ash) as \\"Vic Ash\\" or \\"Tasmanian oak\\". It is slightly denser than E. regnans - estimates of density range from 720 kg/m3 to 830 kg/m3 \\\\- and harder too. The sapwood is pale brown, the heartwood light brown. It has an even texture, with straight grains sometimes interlocked, and well-defined rings. Gum veins are common. The timber has moderate hardness and strength, but low durability. It splits easily, and is easily worked, glued and stained; it is also suitable for steam bending. It is mostly used for pulp production and for construction and manufacture, especially in house building, joinery, flooring, and furniture. =Gallery= Image:Starr_031214-0056_Eucalyptus_obliqua.jpgEucalyptus obliqua in Hospers Grove Maui) Image:Eucalyptus obliqua 1.jpgBark on E. obliqua near Blackburn Lake, Box Hill, Melbourne Image:Eucalyptus obliqua in Wellington Botanical Garden 03.jpgCultivated specimen in Wellington Botanic Garden, New Zealand See also * List of Eucalyptus species * List of superlative trees References Category:Trees of Australia Category:Trees of Mediterranean climate obliqua Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Taxa named by Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle Category:Plants described in 1789 ","title":"Eucalyptus obliqua"},{"id":"7994755","text":"Yerong Creek is a town in the Riverina area of southern New South Wales, Australia.

It has rough, flaky bark near the base of the trunk, smooth bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, nine or eleven, white flowers and cylindrical to conical or cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus saligna is a tree with a straight trunk that typically grows to a height of , rarely to , a dbh of , and forms a lignotuber. The trunk has smooth pale grey or white bark with of rough brownish bark at the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong leaves that are paler on the lower surface, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, oval or diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from December to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cylindrical, conical or cup- shaped capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus saligna was first formally described in 1797 by English naturalist James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, and still bears its original name. The species name saligna refers to some likeness to a willow, though what attribute this is, is unclear. Retrieved 12-24-2011. It has been classified in the subgenus Symphyomyrtus, Section Latoangulatae, Series Transversae (eastern blue gums) by Ian Brooker and David Kleinig. Its two closest relatives are the flooded gum (E. grandis) and the mountain blue gum (E. deanei). Distribution and habitat Sydney blue gum is generally found within of the coastline in its range from Sydney to Maryborough in central Queensland. To the northwest, it is found in disjunct populations in central Queensland, including in Eungella National Park, Kroombit Tops, Consuelo Tableland, Blackdown Tableland and Carnarvon Gorge. It grows in tall forests in more sheltered areas, on clay or loam soils, and alluvial sands. It is a component of the endangered blue gum high forest ecological community in the Sydney region. Populations found south of Sydney are now not considered to be E. saligna. Associated trees include blackbutt (E. pilularis), grey ironbark (E. paniculata), mountain blue gum (E. deanei), flooded gum (E. grandis), tallowwood (E. microcorys), thin-leaved stringybark (E. eugenioides), manna gum (E. viminalis), river peppermint (E. elata), grey gums (E. punctata and E. propinqua ), rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), spotted gum (Corymbia maculata), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa). South of Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River, pure stands of E. saligna give way to hybrid populations with bangalay (E. botryoides). Ecology Eucalyptus saligna regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds on the trunk and lower branches after bushfire. Trees live for over two hundred years. The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) eats the flowers, the koala (Phascalarctos cinereus) eats the leaves, and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) eats the seed. The longhorn beetle species Paroplites australis, Retrieved 12-24-2011. Agrianome spinicollis and Tessaromma undatum have been recorded from the Sydney blue gum. The presence of the territorial and aggressive bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) and psyllid insects (Glycaspis) is correlated with dieback of the canopy of E. saligna, a syndrome which has been termed bell-miner-associated dieback (BMAD), though the exact mechanism remains unclear. Retrieved 12-24-2011. After colonization by Glycaspis, E. salinga may then be infested by the ambrosia beetle Amasa truncata. Uses The wood of this species is heavy (about 850 kg/m3), fairly hard, coarse, even textured and reasonably easy to work. It is used for general building construction, panelling, and boat-building, and is highly prized for flooring and furniture because of its rich dark honey colour.Bootle KR. (1983). Wood in Australia.

Tetrahydrosarcinapterin (THSPT, ) is a modified form of THMPT, wherein a glutamyl group linked to the 2-hydroxyglutaric acid terminus.  THMPT is the main platform for C1 transformations  N-Formylmethanofuran donates the C1 group to the N5 site of the pterin to give the formyl- THMPT. The formyl group subsequently condenses intramolecularly to give methenyl- , which is then reduced to methylene- THMPT. Methylene- MPT is subsequently converted, using coenzyme F420 as the electron source, to methyl- THMPT, catalyzed by F420-dependent methylene- THMPT reductase. Methyl- THMPT is the methyl donor to coenzyme M, a conversion mediated by methyl- THMPT:coenzyme M methyl-transferase.  Comparison with tetrahydrofolic acid  THMPT is related to the better known tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA, ). The most important difference between THMPT and THFA is that THFA has an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group on the phenyl ring. As a consequence, methenyl- THMPT is more difficult to reduce than methenyl- THFA. Reduction is effected by a so-called iron-sulfur cluster free hydrogenase. The cumbersome name distinguishes this hydrogenase from the so-called Fe-only hydrogenases that do contain Fe-S cluster.

The first major work outlining the framework is James Pustejovsky's 1991 article \\"The Generative Lexicon\\". Subsequent important developments are presented in Pustejovsky and Boguraev (1993), Bouillon (1997), and Busa (1996). The first unified treatment of GL was given in Pustejovsky (1995). Unlike purely verb- based approaches to compositionality, generative lexicon attempts to spread the semantic load across all constituents of the utterance. Central to the philosophical perspective of GL are two major lines of inquiry: (1) How is it that we are able to deploy a finite number of words in our language in an unbounded number of contexts? (2) Is lexical information and the representations used in composing meanings separable from our commonsense knowledge? Motivation GL was initially developed as a theoretical framework for encoding selectional knowledge in natural language. This in turn required making some changes in the formal rules of representation and composition. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of GL has been the manner in which lexically encoded knowledge is exploited in the construction of interpretations for linguistic utterances. The computational resources available to a lexical item within this theory consist of the following four levels: #Lexical typing structure: giving an explicit type for a word positioned within a type system for the language; #Argument structure: specifying the number and nature of the arguments to a predicate; #Event structure: defining the event type of the expression and any subeventual structure it may have; with subevents; #Qualia structure: a structural differentiation of the predicative force for a lexical item. Qualia structure The qualia structure, inspired by Moravcsik's (1975) interpretation of the aitia of Aristotle, are defined by Pustejovsky as the modes of explanation associated with a word or phrase in the language, and are defined as follows: #Formal: the basic category of which distinguishes the meaning of a word within a larger domain; #Constitutive: the relation between an object and its constituent parts; #Telic: the purpose or function of the object, if there is one; #Agentive: the factors involved in the object's origins or coming into being.

Scientific accomplishments Working at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, first in Washington, DC and later in Princeton, New Jersey, Manabe worked with director Joseph Smagorinsky to develop three-dimensional models of the atmosphere. As the first step, Manabe and Wetherald (1967) developed one- dimensional, single-column model of the atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium with positive feedback effect of water vapor. Using the model, they found that, in response to the change in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, temperature increases at the Earth's surface and in the troposphere, whereas it decreases in the stratosphere. The development of the radiative-convective model was a critically important step towards the development of comprehensive general circulation model of the atmosphere (Manabe et al. 1965). They used the model to simulate for the first time the three-dimensional response of temperature and the hydrologic cycle to increased carbon dioxide(Manabe and Wetherald, 1975). In 1969 Manabe and Bryan published the first simulations of the climate by a coupled ocean-atmosphere models, in which the general circulation model of the atmosphere is combined with that of ocean. Throughout the 1990s early 2000s, Manabe's research group published seminal papers using the coupled atmosphere ocean models to investigate the time-dependent response of climate to changing greenhouse gas concentrations of the atmosphere (Stouffer et al.,1989; Manabe et al., 1991 & 1992). They also applied the model to the study of past climate change, including the role of freshwater input to the North Atlantic Ocean as a potential cause of the so-called, abrupt climate change evident in the paleoclimatic record (Manabe and Stouffer,1995 & 2000). See the book (Manabe and Broccoli, 2020) for further details. Refer to Selected Publications for inline citations. Career Born in 1931, Manabe received a Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo in 1958 and came to the United States to work at the General Circulation Research Section of the U.S. Weather Bureau, now the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of NOAA, continuing until 1997.[1][2][3] From 1997 to 2001, he worked at the Frontier Research System for Global Change in Japan serving as Director of the Global Warming Research Division. In 2002 he returned to the United States as a visiting research collaborator at the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, Princeton University. He currently serves as senior meteorologist at the university. Awards and honors Manabe is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, and a foreign member of Japan Academy, Academia Europaea and the Royal Society of Canada. In 1992, Manabe was the first recipient of the Blue Planet Prize of the Asahi Glass Foundation. In 1995, he received the Asahi Prize from Asahi News- Cultural Foundation. In 1997 Manabe was awarded the Volvo Environmental Prize from the Volvo Foundation. In 2015 Manabe was awarded Benjamin Franklin Medal of Franklin Institute. Manabe is a co-winner of BBVA Foundation Frontier of Knowledge Award for the achievement described below. Manabe has also been honored with the American Meteorological Society‚Äôs Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal, the Second Half Century Award, and Meisinger Award. In addition, he is honored with the American Geophysical Union‚Äôs William Bowie Medal and Revelle Medal, and in 1998 received the Milutin Milankovic Medal from the European Geophysical Society. Manabe and Bryan's work in the development of the first global climate models has been selected as one of the Top Ten Breakthroughs to have occurred in NOAA's first 200 years. In honor of his retirement from NOAA / GFDL, a three-day scientific meeting was held in Princeton, New Jersey in March 1998. It was titled \\"Understanding Climate Change: A Symposium in honor of Syukuro Manabe\\". The 2005 annual meeting of American Meteorological Society included a special Suki Manabe Symposium. Manabe is co-winner with climatologist James Hansen of the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Climate Change category in this ninth edition (2016) of the awards. The two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior. Decades ago, they correctly predicted how much Earth‚Äôs temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric CO2. The scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by Manabe and Hansen. Manabe received the Crafoord Prize 2018 in Geosciences jointly with Susan Solomon \\"for fundamental contributions to understanding the role of atmospheric trace gases in Earth‚Äôs climate system\\".

Occupation Grave of Miron Bia≈Çoszewski at PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw. Miron Bia≈Çoszewski (; born June 30, 1922, Warsaw ‚Äì died June 17, 1983, Warsaw), was a Polish poet, novelist, playwright and actor. Biography Bia≈Çoszewski studied linguistics at the clandestine courses of the University of Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Following the end of the Warsaw Uprising, he was sent to a labour camp in the Third Reich, and returned to Warsaw at the end of World War II. First, he worked at the central post office, and then as a journalist for a number of popular magazines, some of them for children. In 1955 Bia≈Çoszewski took part in the foundation of a small theatre called Teatr na Tarczy≈Ñskiej, where he premiered his plays Wiwisekcja and Osmƒôdeusze, and acted in them with Ludmi≈Ça Murawska. In the same year Bia≈Çoszewski debuted in ≈ªycie literackie along with another renowned Polish poet and his contemporary, Zbigniew Herbert. Bia≈Çoszewski was gay and for many years, he shared an apartment at Pl. DƒÖbrowskiego 7 with his live-in partner, the painter Leszek Soli≈Ñski. According to Joanna Nizynska from University of California in Los Angeles: His highly acclaimed memoir, Pamiƒôtnik z powstania warszawskiego (\\"Memoir of the Warsaw Uprising\\") was published in 1970 (and translated into English in 1977). In it, Bia≈Çoszewski gave a philosophical account of his wartime experiences 27 years after the fact. In 1982, he was awarded the Jurzykowski Prize by the New York-based Alfred Jurzykowski Foundation. He died of a heart attack on June 17, 1983. There is a large body of literature devoted to the critical analysis of Bia≈Çoszewski's works - most notably by such writers and academics as Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, Maria Janion, Stanis≈Çaw Bara≈Ñczak, Jan B≈Ço≈Ñski, Kazimierz Wyka and Artur Sandauer.

The host of the show was Tom Jolls, who had joined WKBW as a weatherman earlier in 1965. When the show launched, it consisted of interstitial segments with Jolls shown around episodes of the Adventures of Superman, a TV series that ran from 1952 till 1958. Dustmop the puppet (a dog) was introduced in 1967. An alligator puppet, Matty the Mod followed, along with the first female puppet Cecily Fripple, modeled after the American comedian Phyllis Diller. A similar appearing puppet was Cecily's evil sister Cecile. In the early 1970s, Superman (whose rights had moved to the networks) would be replaced with other family and children's programming including re- runs of The Three Stooges, The Flintstones, Batman, Little Rascals, The Munsters, and The Addams Family. Many short animated cartoons also were shown: Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes were staples for many years, including some of the earliest Porky Pig and Bugs Bunny shorts from the 1930s. Hanna-Barbera cartoons such as Touch√© Turtle and Peter Potamus replaced Bugs and his friends after a time. A number of MGM cartoons from the 1930s were shown as well. Near the end of its run, the show was renamed Commander Tom's World and relegated to weekends. In later years, it played such shows as Davey and Goliath, Rainbow Brite, and The Getalong Gang. After the show was cancelled in 1991, the \\"Commander Tom\\" character was merged into another show, a revival of Rocketship 7 in 1992. That, too, came to an end in 1993, and the character of \\"Commander Tom\\" had gone for good. Tom would often travel from school to school to speak to young children.

The original Main Building featured a high cupola with a clock and the \\"captain's walk\\" used by the local Weather Observatory. Between the building's completion and 1919, the cupola progressively shrank in size; after 1919, the roof took on a \\"gabled appearance\\" that characterized the structure until the fire in 2001. During the administration of President Henry Barker (1911‚Äì1917), there was a plan to reconstruct the front of the Main Building to include stone pillars, but this was abandoned soon after it was initiated. In 1918, a campus post office and bookstore were located in the basement; both were relocated in 1925. In 1919, a cafeteria was added, but this was removed in 1929. The building originally housed the campus offices for the State College, along with several classrooms. It also contained the college armory, classrooms used by the Commandant of Cadets, a shop, the President's office, a natural history museum, two laboratories, and housed the Normal, French, German, English, Mathematics, Classical and Preparatory departments. There was also room available for a small chapel that could house the entire student population, faculty, and staff, and for the Kentucky Geological Survey. It was renamed the Administration Building in 1948. On April 4, 2000, the Administration Building became a focal point for students protesting the university's contract with Nike, a company they accused of using sweatshop labor.

The company commands approximately 1% of the Japanese beer market. However, it controls 60% of the beer market on Okinawa. Orion uses water that \\"comes from springs\\" out of the mountain \\"just behind the brewery\\". Like many breweries, Orion likes to give some credit for the quality of its beer to the source of its water. Orion also has its own ingredients and techniques. Founded in 1957 in Nago, Okinawa during the American occupation of Okinawa, Orion began making beer in 1959. Orion struggled to compete with the other major Japanese breweries, but after changing from a German-style beer to an American-style beer, it gained the top share in the Okinawan market. Orion became the most widely consumed beer in Okinawa, and \\"the company's popularity took off as the brew became a more American-style beer\\", but until 2002, it had a market that was limited to mostly Okinawa. Since 2002, Orion has worked together with Asahi Breweries to manufacture Asahi beers in Okinawa, in return for Asahi's assistance in selling Orion beer outside of Okinawa. Orion made an agreement with Asahi Breweries to increase its market, and it is now distributed much more widely in Japan but had yet to capture a lot of attention in international market. \\"While Orion Breweries maintains its independence in Okinawa, it is now distributed outside of Okinawa through the Asahi company\\". Orion beer has been featured in professional wrestling, as Okinawan wrestler Menso-re Oyaji regularly carries an Orion beer can with him to the ring during his matches. Akihito Yagi, 8th Dan in Meibukan Goju Ryu Karate-do, which his late grandfather (Meitoku Yagi) created, and who is the current chairman of the International Meibukan Goju Ryu Karate Association (IMGKA), is a spokesman for Orion beer. On May 14, 2019, Orion entered the ch≈´hai market to appeal to those that cannot drink beer or find it unappealing to them to allow them to indulge in ch≈´hais instead. Their initial release of the WATTA ch≈´hai brand, using traditional Okinawan flavors, was Relax (4% ABV), STRONG (9% ABV) and STRONG DRY (9% ABV).

The name is from the 'Are'are language meaning the Rule of \\"relationship of siblings together\\" and is often corrupted to \\"Marching Rule\\", \\"Marxist Rule\\", or \\"Rule of Brotherhood\\". Foundation and influences The movement was created after Nori, Aliki Nono'oohimae, Jonathan Fiifii'i, and a host of others from Malaita who worked together in the Solomon Islands Labour Corps during World War II. One of the influences is said to have been the African-American soldiers whose humane treatment of the fellow workers was markedly different from the plantation owners. They spread a message of independence amongst the Malaitan soldiers who began a campaign of non- compliance and civil disobedience. They were also influenced by other revolutionary or anti-government movements, progressive missionaries such as Rev. Richard Fallowes and apocalyptic movements such as that of the priest Noto'i. During 1939 in Uogwari and Atobala he had been a prophet of the ancestor La'aka and channelled that Tulagi would be destroyed and the government would be thrown into the sea. His followers were arrested by the government but in 1946, the capital moved from Tulagi to Honiara. Noto'i joined the Maasina Ruru movement as did people from all over the islands. Operation DeLouse and Operation Jericho In 1947, the British government launched Operation De-Louse to arrest the leaders of the movement. The nine main chiefs or Alaha were also arrested and charged under the Sedition Act for organising secret meetings. This despite the fact that Maasina Ruru meetings were mass meetings of thousands of people at a time. They were mostly sentenced, including Fifi'i, Nonoohimae and Aliki, to six and a half years hard labour. While the leaders were in jail the campaign of civil disobedience continued with villages refusing to pay taxes en masse. While many villages were also barricaded against the British, the government launched Operation Jericho. Two thousand arrests were made in Malaita alone and yet the resistance continued. In 1951 the British government held meetings with the imprisoned leadership and brokered a deal for self-government in the form of the Malaitan Congress. The prisoners were released and demands were met towards the end of 1951. Sources *Fifi'i, Jonathan; From pig-theft to parliament: My life between two worlds, translated and edited by Roger Keesing.

(–ó–∞ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å! in both Russian and Belarusian) was a campaign slogan used in Belarus starting in 2004 to push for constitutional alterations inside the country, which consisted of (1) enabling a citizen to become the country's president for more than two times (as had been the case until 2004) and (2) to allow the current president Alexander Lukashenko to run for a third term. The campaign was usually announced and spread by using television airtime, public concerts or billboards erected in the country. The campaign was used again in the 2006 presidential elections, with the addition of a song played on Belarusian Television on the day of the elections. The campaign was also used by the BRSM to support the government's discourse on patriotism (in contrast to that of the political opposition: e.g. the Belarusian Popular Front, which uses another slogan: \\"–ñ—ã–≤–µ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å!\\"). Use The characteristics of the campaign include the use of the phrase occasionally with the addition of names or organizations, such as workers or the military, and attributes such as \\"stable\\", \\"flourishing\\", \\"strong\\" Belarus. The letters \\"–óA\\" (\\"for\\") are always capitalized and colored red and green, invoking the national flag. In this layout, the word \\"–óA\\" has national connotations and is visually prominent, suggesting that it is the most important word in the slogan. Thus, it was suggested to the electorate that they should vote \\"for\\", that is, for the constitutional reforms that enabled president Lukashenko to run for his third term (2004) and to vote for him in the 2006 presidential elections, because it correlates with voting \\"for Belarus\\". Belarusian state- owned media depict the political opposition as a subversive group that intends to disorganise the country and \\"sell\\" it to the \\"West\\". From this point of view, the slogan may easily be interpreted as an identification of the current president or government with Belarus. To vote for someone else would then mean to vote against the interests of the country and its people.

Recording Career Collins was discovered by Carroll Levis, whose promotion landed her a contract with Decca Records.Larkin C 'Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) p120 She released three singles through Decca which failed to chart and was dropped by the label. Her manager father then recorded some demos with her and introduced her to independent record producer Joe Meek, who took her on. Meek featured house bands The Tornados and also The Outlaws featuring the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore on some of her tracks. She released a total of eight singles with Meek, released through the HMV Pop and Pye labels, none of which appeared in the UK Singles Chart. After Meek's suicide in 1967 she recorded sporadically, but his death had effectively put paid to her career; and she retired at the end of the 1960s after a few years on the cabaret circuit. Collins came out of retirement briefly in 1999 to record a cover version of \\"Avenues and Alleyways\\" (The Protectors theme) with record producer Russell C. Brennan (aka Russell C. Writer), which featured on the compilation album, Cult Themes from the 70's, Vol. 2, on Future Legend Records. Her agents were keen to organise a tour. A 2006 compilation titled This Little Girl's Gone Rockin' contained her complete surviving recorded output. In 2019, Collins made a second comeback and teamed up again with Brennan once more, as she liked working with him and considered him Meek's successor, to do a new cover of another theme for the last album in the Future Legend Records cult themes series. It was called Cult Themes Forever. This time she recorded \\"Nobody's Fool\\" (the theme from Budgie) written by Ray Davies. A full track listing for this 15 track album is available online. In 2020, Collins did a special recording with Brennan again. This was a unique release as it was co produced by Joe Meek. Utilising a backing track recorded in the 1960s by Meek, Brennan wrote a female slant on the song, \\"The Long Drop\\" originally meant for Tony Kaye (aka Tony Grinham). It is released online to coincide with the anniversary of Meek's death on 3 February 2020.

Written by Nancy Mitford and first published in 1957, the book also explores the French Enlightenment. In March 1729 Voltaire was allowed to go back to France. In spite of his love for England, he had become homesick; like many a Frenchman, he could not stand the austerity. In well-to-do houses, according to him, there was no silver on the table; tallow candles were burnt by all but the very rich; the food everywhere was uneatable. The arts of society, the art of pleasing were hardly cultivated and social life very dull compared with that in France. Furthermore, the weather did not suit his \\"unhappy machine\\".

It is Europe's largest national park (ahead of Vatnaj√∂kull National Park in Iceland) and it was Russia's largest national park until the creation of Beringia National Park in 2013.  History  The park was created by the Russian Government on April 23, 1994, with the goals of protection and recreational use of the taiga forests of the Northern Urals. In 1995, the forest area including the Yugyd Va National Park and the nearby Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve were recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, Virgin Komi Forests.  Geography  Manaraga River near Mount Manaraga. The Yugyd Va National Park is located on the western slopes of the Polar Ural and Northern Ural, on the border of Europe and Asia. The rivers flowing from the western slope of the Ural Mountains supply water to Pechora River, one of the largest rivers in Europe flowing into the Barents Sea. The natural boundary of the park in the east is the main ridge of the Ural mountains, in the north - the Kozhim River, in the west - the rivers Synja, Vangir and Kosya, in the south - the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve. The territory of the park is part of the Prepolar-Ural physical-geographical area and is located in three zones - mountain, foothill and lowland, which were formed more than 200 million years ago. It is here in the central part of the Yugid Va National Park that the highest peaks of the Ural Mountains are: the Mount Narodnaya (1894.5 m), as well as the Mount Karpinsky (1878 m), Bell Tower (1724 m), Manaraga (1662 m), Nioroika (1645 m).  Wildlife  More than half of the park is covered with the taiga boreal forest; the rest is mostly tundra, found at higher elevations. There are also some 20 km2 of meadows, both alpine ones and those in the river valleys. Some 180 bird species live in the park, some of them quite rare. Twenty fish species are known to inhabit the park's rivers and lakes. There are also five amphibian species and one reptile species in the park. Among the mammals common in the park are the mountain hare, flying squirrel, reindeer, ermine, otter, Alces alces (known as the moose in North American English and elk in British English), wolf, fox, wolverine, bear, pine marten, weasel, Arctic fox.  Tourism  Recreational uses of the park include rafting, boating, and hiking in the summer, Nordic skiing in winter. Limited hunting is allowed too, but permits have to be applied for several months in advance. Due to the remote location of the park, the amount of tourism there is still quite low. According to the park's management, it is currently visited by some 4,000 tourists every year, which is much less than the park's potential recreational capacity. The management was concerned with the fact that the user fees (some 2.4 million roubles (US$100,000) a year) did not cover park expenses (some 5 million roubles (US$200,000) a year). \\"Clear future for the 'Clear Water', or how Yugyd Va National Park is to develop\\" Krasnoye Znamya (a local newspaper), 15 March 2006, No. 40.

The interchange consists of Interstate 90, the Mass Pike Extension, and the Interstate 93 concurrency with US 1 and MA 3 south of the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel. The interchange dominates the South Bay parcel, a 10-acre (40,000 m¬≤) site between Chinatown and the Leather District. It is roughly bounded by Kneeland Street, Hudson Street, the Massachusetts Turnpike mainline, and the Interstate 93 mainline. Currently owned by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA), the area is taken up by a major highway interchange between 90, 93, and local streets. There were originally plans to re-develop the area with a 600-foot tall office tower, but no such project has taken place. History of the site The South Bay parcel, as well as the adjacent Chinatown and Leather District neighborhoods, sit on filled land. Once part of South Cove, a portion of Boston's South Bay, it was filled in 1833 by the South Cove Corporation, who built an intermodal train/sea station as part of the Boston and Worcester Railroad. This development included residential and commercial area, and what was considered at the time to be the largest hotel in the United States. Throughout most of the 19th Century and the early half of the 20th Century, the district was made up of rail yards serving railroads entering Boston from the south and west. The rail yards and terminus attracted leather and garment businesses, which constructed the commercial buildings in the adjacent Leather District. Similarly, the railroad served as an immigrant gateway, a role which it played beginning in the late 19th century for many Asian newcomers, particularly Chinese. In the 1950s, the Massachusetts Highway Department displaced much of the rail yards to build the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway (the Central Artery). Later the South Bay interchange connected the Central Artery to the Massachusetts Turnpike. The intersection has since been reconstructed by the Big Dig, with tunnels to South Boston and Logan Airport. Interchange construction The interchange was constructed beginning in the late 1990s as a major feature of the Big Dig project. By using a variety of methods including soil freezing and tunnel jacking to maintain adjacent subway, freight and commuter rail operations, engineers were able avoid major interruption of existing traffic flows. The name South Bay originates from the state of the area prior to nineteenth century land reclamation efforts which filled an area of marshes and brackish water that was an estuary of Boston Harbor with dirt from nearby high ground.

In the water cycle, when precipitation falls on the earth's land, some of the water flows on the surface forming streams and rivers. The remaining water, through infiltration, penetrates the soil traveling underground, hydrating the vadose zone soil, recharging aquifers, with the excess flowing in subsurface runoff. In hydrogeology it is measured by the Groundwater flow equation. Runoff Water flows from areas where the water table is higher to areas where it is lower. This flow can be either surface runoff in rivers and streams, or subsurface runoff infiltrating rocks and soil. The amount of runoff reaching surface and groundwater can vary significantly, depending on rainfall, soil moisture, permeability, groundwater storage, evaporation, upstream use, and whether or not the ground is frozen. The movement of subsurface water is determined largely by the water gradient, type of substrate, and any barriers to flow. Surface return Subsurface water may return to the surface in groundwater flow, such as from a spring, seep, or a water well, or subsurface return to streams, rivers, and oceans. Water returns to the land surface at a lower elevation than where infiltration occurred, under the force of gravity or gravity induced pressures. Groundwater tends to move slowly, and is replenished slowly, so it can remain in aquifers for thousands of years. Mainly, water flows through the ground which leads to the ocean where the cycle begins again. Subsurface flow Flow within the soil body may take place under unsaturated conditions, but faster subsurface flow is associated with localized soil saturation.* See also *Artesian aquifer *Ecohydrology *Groundwater *Groundwater energy balance *Groundwater flow *Groundwater recharge *Vadose zone *Water cycle References *enchartedlearning.com *tutor.com/ *Huggett, J.

Since the 1930s, the ferry has been operated by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The ferry is located on SR 1500 south of Windsor, North Carolina. It is one of three cable ferries that are still operating in North Carolina. The others are the Parker's Ferry and Elwell Ferry. History The Sans Souci Ferry has operated in some form or fashion since at least the 1800s. It was not until the 1930s that the state Department of Transportation took over operations of the ferry and has operated it ever since. The ferry is not considered part of the state ferry system, which operates larger ferries along the immediate NC coast. The NC cable ferries are considered inland ferries. They are operated by regional DOT divisional offices instead of the NC DOT Ferry Division. Operations The ferry is literally driven, or one could say guided, by a steel cable that stretches across the river. The cable is secured on each side of the river by steel posts. As the ferry crosses the river, the force of the boat, with the help of rollers on the side of the boat, pulls the normally submerged cable out of the water. The cable is permanently secured to the ferry and prevents the boat from straying off course in normal river currents. The ferry carries a maximum of two cars and does not operate in high water conditions or storms, as there is too much risk of the cable snapping in such treacherous conditions. Persons wanting to ride the ferry that happen to be on the opposite side of the river than the ferry must blow their vehicle horn to summon the ferry. The trip by ferry across the river takes roughly 5 minutes and saves a drive of about 20 miles. The ferry is free of charge. The ferry operates almost every day except for days of high water and bad weather. Vessel The ferry has a steel, barge-like platform that cars drive onto. The \\"engine room\\" is located on one side of the ferry. Here the operator sits and controls the boat's engine, which is located outside and beside the room. The ferry is powered by a John Deere diesel engine. The operator must know when to let off the throttle, since the ferry has no brakes or on-board steering device. Replacement Many have worried over the years that the ferry might be replaced by a bridge. NCDOT officials have said that the ferry will likely never be replaced with a bridge because of the high cost. The ferry serves a secondary road that carries mainly local traffic; the volume is not sufficient to justify construction costs of a bridge.

It was originally known as Rogers No. 3, but 1869 Rogers named it after a prominent Native American chief from early Massachusetts history, Ousamequin, who used the title Massasoit. Massasoit is female, and thus requires a second grape variety as a pollen source for full fruit set. However unlike many female-flowered grapes, if left unpollinated the variety will often set a number of small, seedless grapes, so consistently that the variety circulated for many years under the name Williams Seedless. Fruit is a dark brown-red, and ripens earlier than any of the other Rogers' Hybrids, though considered by many to be inferior to that of the others. Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick, in Grapes of New York, stated that the fruit is at its best before it fully ripens, acquiring an unpleasant degree of foxiness if allowed to hang on the vine too long.

Snowden Jr. (July 17, 1911February 18, 2007), was an American historian and classicist, best known for his study of black people in classical antiquity. He was a Distinguished Professor emeritus of classics at Howard University. Career Snowden was born in rural York County, Virginia, on July 17, 1911, but raised in Boston. He graduated from Boston Latin School and earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees from Harvard University, completing his doctoral degree in 1944. After a brief period teaching at Virginia State College and at Spelman College, he moved to Howard University, where he remained the rest of his career. At Howard, he served as chair of the classics department for many years, and was dean of the College of Liberal Arts from 1956 to 1968. Snowden retired in 1976. In retirement, he taught at Howard as professor emeritus; he also taught at Vassar College, and Mary Washington College. He was dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Howard University, and was the first honoree in the Howard University Libraries' \\"Excellence at Howard\\" program. Snowden's books include Blacks in Antiquity: Ethiopians in the Greco-Roman Experience (1970), which received the Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit of the American Philological Association, and Before Color Prejudice: The Ancient View of Blacks (1983). He was also a contributor to The Image of the Black in Western Art I: From the Pharaohs to the Fall of the Roman Empire (1976). Snowden served as a member of the American delegation to UNESCO in Paris, France. He also served as a cultural attach√© to the United States Embassy in Rome, Italy in the Eisenhower administration, and as a specialist lecturer for the U.S. State Department. Work Snowden was largely known for his studies of black people in the ancient world. He documented that in ancient Rome and Greece racial prejudice was not an issue. Much of this, according to Snowden, is because most of the Africans encountered in Rome were not slaves. Most of the Africans documented in Rome and Greece met were warriors, statesmen, and mercenaries. Therefore, Africans were not subjected to the racism of modern civilization. He studied ancient art and literature, and he found mass evidence Africans were able to co-exist with the Greeks and Romans of the time. Later life and death In 2003, Snowden was honored at the White House as a recipient of the National Humanities Medal. He died of congestive heart failure in Washington, D.C., on February 18, 2007. Personal life Snowden lived in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Elaine Hill Snowden, whom he was married to from 1935, until her death in 2005.

He received his early education from St. Andrew's College on P.E.I., before being sent to study at the College of St. Hyacinthe, followed later by a theological course at the Seminary of Quebec. Ordained a priest in 1843, McIntyre served in a number of parishes, including in Quebec and his native Prince Edward Island. On the island, he was assigned to Tignish, where he is recognized as having built one of the finest churches in Canada. He served seventeen years in Tignish before he was appointed as Bishop of Charlottetown on May 8, 1860 and was consecrated August 15 of the same year at St. Dunstan's Basilica. = Bishop of Charlottetown = As bishop, his first trouble was anti-Catholic sentiment, that had been expressed in several Island newspapers. However, the problem seemed to eventually pass, and peace was restored. Bishop McIntyre would also become the first diocesan bishop to take up lodgings in Charlottetown, where the \\"palace\\" was built in 1875. The house continues to act as a home for the basilica and other clergy. In the field of education, McIntyre established many churches and schools in the diocese, including a convent in the Magdalen Islands. He was also responsible for erecting St. Patrick's School for Boys next to St. Dunstan's Basilica, and followed in the footsteps of his predecessor Bernard Donald McDonald by bringing Sisters of Notre Dame to teach on Prince Edward Island. In 1869, McIntyre was one of many who attended the First Vatican Council in Rome. Later, he toured parts of Europe and Asia. In 1878, the bishop was a key figure in the establishment of the Charlottetown Hospital, the first hospital in the city which was open to people of any religious background. McIntyre was also instrumental in establishing the Catholic Total Abstinence Union which spread through the diocese during the 1870s to help prevent the danger of alcohol consumption. Bishop Peter McIntyre died in 1891 at the bishop's house in Antigonish after serving as head of the Diocese of Charlottetown for thirty-one years. His funeral was held at St. Dunstan's Basilica and his remains were taken by train to his native parish of St. Peter's Bay to be interred in the basement beneath the church altar.

Isaar has the same zip code as the City of Seymour and its schools are part of the Seymour Community School District. Isaar was founded in 1867 by immigrants from Bavaria who settled there as part of the Homestead Act. The town was named by the new settlers after the Isar River in their homeland. Isaar became known for its St. Sebastian Catholic Church, although in September 2007 the last resident priest left Isaar. The community is home to a number of clubs, such as the snowmobile club, called the Isaar Trail Riders, and the Isaar Booster Club. The downtown area of Isaar is located at the intersection of County Hwy VV and Isaar Road. Isaar has always been known as a small farming community and continues this tradition today. Today the community has a tavern/restaurant, a construction company, a food processing plant, and a nursery, as well as few other businesses within its business district. Transportation County Highway VV, running east‚Äìwest, is the main road that connects Isaar to other larger state highways. There are also snowmobile trails that run through the community. Geography Isaar is located at (44.57167, -88.28444), at an elevation of . The land around Isaar is flat and very fertile, which is excellent for the cabbage and corn grown in the area. There are multiple creeks that run through the area, often man-made creeks to prevent flooding and to keep the run-off from damaging the fields. History of Isaar Isaar is located in the northeastern corner of the Town of Seymour. Named after the Isar River, in Germany, the community was founded in the late 1860s by Bavarian immigrants. The town's founding families included Kroner, Hackl, Ebert, Liebhabers, Krause, Wirth, Schmidt, Brugger, Hartl, and Noll. In 1893, the Isaar community's request for a church was granted by the Roman Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Green Bay, Sebastian Gebhard Messmer. St. Sebastian Church, named in honor of Bishop Messmer's patron saint, was a wooden building constructed by Isaar citizens on John Kroner's land, which is believed to have been donated. This church was completed in 1893 at a cost of $100. A cemetery was established north of the church two years later. The rectory was constructed in 1916 and the Isaar church was no longer a mission. In late December, 1929, a fire destroyed the original church. The brick church that stands today was built shortly after the wooden church burned down. It was built by the Eisenreich Construction Company of Isaar. Ebert's Store, which was the general store, grocery store, saloon and dance hall, was constructed in 1900 and is today the Isaar Inn. South of Ebert's store was the blacksmith shop, built in the 1890s. Isaar's First School was built one mile north of Isaar in 1898, now known as Seymour School District No.7. In 1902 a tavern was opened by John Kroner to the north of the church cemetery. A sawmill was opened, by John Schmidt and Henry Wirth, 200 feet east of Kroner's Tavern in 1908. The first cheese factory was built in 1890 by Jacob Noll just a mile north of Isaar. In 1918 a cooperative cheese factory was begun by Isaar farmers. This factory, which is just north of the Isaar Inn, was operational until 1993.Charles Ebert and Seymour Community Museum & Historical Society History of Church and Community Events St. Sebastian church had at one time an annual church picnic where all parish members could spend the day playing baseball and other games. St. Sebastian was also known for its locally famous \\"Annual Porky and Pancake Supper\\". This event was run by community volunteers and brought in revenue for the church youth organization. It was known for its potato pancakes, a favorite meal of the Isaar community. In 2002 St. Sebastian Church hosted the 50th anniversary of this event, which was the last Porky and Pancake Supper Isaar hosted. Low volunteer turnout has been attributed to the collapse of this event.

As a military commander in that year and the following, he was known for the battles against Pyrrhus of Epirus that led to the expression \\"Pyrrhic victory\\". He was the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, and possibly the first teacher of Roman law to offer public instruction. Biography Coruncanius, of plebeian descent, is believed to have hailed from Tusculum. He was first elected consul in 280 BC with Publius Valerius Laevinus, and led an expedition into Etruria against the Etruscan cities. When Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Italia, and defeated the Roman legions of Laevinus at the Battle of Heraclea, Tiberius' legions were recalled to Rome to bolster the defense of Roman territory. In 254 BC or 253 BC, he was the first plebeian elected Pontifex Maximus, or chief priest of the Roman Republic, which position had been previously monopolized by patricians. He died in 241 BC and was succeeded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus, another plebeian. Impact He was the first who publicly professed law (publice professus est), known to be both eloquent and full of knowledge.George Long article, p. 655 of A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities by William Smith. John Murray, London 1875. Like Socrates, he left no writings. His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (jurisprudentes), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.Unknown. \\"legal education.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved 4 March 2007 . It is possible that as the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students of the law of Ancient Rome to attend his consultations tasked with giving legal advice to citizens. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested. As such, he became the first teacher of Roman law (how students of law learned their material earlier is unknown).

Highway marker sign Elwell Ferry Road & NC Hwy 53 Along with Parker's Ferry and Sans Souci Ferry, the Elwell Ferry is one of three remaining cable ferries operating in North Carolina. History In the absence of nearby river crossings, brothers Walter Hayes Russ and John Roland Russ approached Bladen County officials and were granted authority to operate a crossing ferry. Service began in 1905 with Walter Russ and later his son, Lee Roy Russ, operating the ferry.Elwell Ferry, Kelly, North Carolina. Centennial edition. Ed. J. A. McKoy and C. A. Carter. (Kelly Historical Society, 2005). The service was named for a local family. Initially constructed of wood, the 33-foot ferryboat was poled upstream and rowed back by hand and could carry a wagon and two mules. The county subsidized the ferry's operation for toll-free service six days a week, with a quarter on Sundays and a fifty cent toll for night crossings. In the 1930s, the North Carolina Department of Transportation incorporated its inland ferries into the state highway system, installing the first cable at Elwell and providing larger boats that could be guided with a pull stick. Walter Russ oversaw the modernization as well as the addition of a gasoline-powered engine on the boat in the late 1930s. Until 1952, the Ferry was the only river crossing between Wilmington and Elizabethtown. Operations The ferry travels a distance of 110 yards, shore to shore, with a travel time of five minutes, has a maximum capacity of two cars or four tons by weight, operates without a toll, and operates daily, providing service from 6AM to 6PM, Spring and Summer, and from sunrise to sunset in the Winter and Fall. There is no ferry service on Christmas Day or on days of high water or storm conditions. Vehicles arriving on the opposite shore from the ferry, summon the ferry by blowing their horn. Ferry traffic averages 60 to 80 vehicles daily. Elwell Ferry Status - east side Cape Fear river The inland cable ferries located in North Carolina are operated by regional DOT divisional offices rather than the North Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division, with the Elwell Ferry operated by private contract with DOT Division 6. There are no plans to replace the Elwell Ferry with a bridge, which would likely cost more than the service for the secondary road would justify. Current design Originally constructed of wood and since 1967 constructed of steel, the barge-like vessel features the controllman's room to one side, with the diesel engine sitting aside the control room. As a powered cable ferry, the vessel is guided by a steel cable drawn across the river, secured on each shore by steel anchors. The cable is lowered into the river when the ferry is not operational and is stretched across the river during hours of operation. There is sufficient clearance for small boats to pass under the cable, but it is lowered when barges pass, though barge traffic on the Cape Fear river in this section ceased in the 1990s. The ferry is powered by a diesel engine and a propeller. Stopping is controlled by the operator's throttle. As the ferry cannot turn around, each end includes a ramp, and alignment of the ferry at each end is automatic. Fatalities, accidents and closings Walter Russ, originator of the service, was the ferry's first fatality, killed in a March 1942 explosion caused when poorly ventilated fumes ignited in the bilge. A year later the ferry had been rebuilt and resumed service with safety improvements. In 1967 two men committed suicide by jumping off the ferry and in 1994 two men were killed trying to push an oversize vehicle onto the ferry. Prior to the use of wheel chocks, several vehicles had fallen overboard. For two months in the summer of 2009, the ferry service remained closed, while pavement erosion from the Cape Fear River at the north and southern ferry landings was repaired. Service resumed in August, 2009.

In June 2006, Tarari announced that its next generation chips that will support the AMD Torrenza initiative - and it will incorporate HyperTransport interfaces. HyperTransport based- systems offer a dramatically reduced latency and increased throughput. This is because a HyperTransport connected system allows a co-processor to have direct access to the system's HyperTransport bus, and thus as much access to system resources as other conventional CPUs. PCI-Express and HyperTransport buses both allow systems to communicate at 20-25 Gbit/s versus 4-8 Gbit/s for Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI/PCI-X based systems. Just as the latest desktop machines are using PCI-Express for their high-performance graphic cards now servers will be able to use these high speed interconnects to add other hardware-based co-processors. PCI-Express and HyperTransport buses both operate serially using multiple lanes - PCI-Express supports 1, 2, 4 or 8 lane connectivity at 2.5 Gbit/s per lane. Whereas PCI/PCI-X works using parallel transfers and is most efficient in the 2k - 4k byte per transfer range, PCI- Express and HyperTransport are very efficient at transfers as small as just 64 bytes. Therefore, applications such as in intrusion-prevention system (IPS) and VOIP security applications which have to examine a large volume of small packets will benefit from such high-speed and highly efficient transfer capabilities.

From 1786 to 1797 he was the leader of a royal botanical expedition to the Philippines. Early life According to his biographer Mar√≠a Bel√©n Ba√±as Llanos, Juan de Cu√©llar was born in Aranjuez into a family employed in the care of plants in the royal gardens. His parents also ran a pharmacy. His father died when he was young, and his mother remarried, to a man the king had named regent of the pharmacy. When his mother also died (in 1760), he sold the olive groves that constituted his inheritance and moved to Madrid. In December 1760 he bought a pharmacy on Atocha Street in Madrid, and entered the Royal College of Pharmacists. After completing the course, he continued his association with the College in various important capacities - first secretary, general solicitor, fiscal, and second secretary, at different times. Around 1781 he was forced to give up his pharmacy for financial reasons. In 1783 and 1784 he attended classes at the Real Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Madrid, in a program to impart scientific knowledge to pharmacists. In a letter dated December 17, 1784, Cu√©llar wrote to Crist√≥bal Nieto de Pi√±a, vice president of the Royal Medical Society of Seville, that he was compiling a herbarium based on the system of Carl Linnaeus and asking for Nieto's recommendation to fill the vacant position of botanist in Seville. The Royal Medical Society of Seville gave him the appointment on May 2, 1785, but he was unable to accept immediately because he had also been named royal commissioner in C√°diz. Work on Ruiz and Pav√≥n specimens The El Peruano had arrived in C√°diz on February 21, 1785, carrying part of the scientific material sent back from Peru and Chile by the royal expedition under Hip√≥lito Ruiz and Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n. Also arriving on the El Peruano was Joseph Dombey, a Frenchman who had served as second botanist on the Ruiz and Pav√≥n expedition. Cu√©llar was to catalogue and sort the material and prepare it for transfer to the Casa de Contrataci√≥n. Dombey, however, wanted to transship the specimens to France rather than opening the boxes in Spain. This conflict was resolved, however, and on August 17, 1785 the specimens were delivered to the Casa de Contrataci√≥n. It may be because of this work that Ruiz and Pav√≥n named the genus Cuellaria for him. On March 10, 1785, King Charles III signed a royal order establishing the Real Compa√±√≠a de Filipinas (Royal Philippine Company). This was a political-mercantile society intended to turn the Philippines into a hub of trade between Asia and America. (That would have meant the end of the monopoly of the Manila galleon, and was opposed by many Spaniards in the Philippines.) The Company was also intended to investigate and exploit the natural resources of the Philippines themselves. The Company asked the minister of the Indies, Jos√© de G√°lvez to name a botanist to investigate the flora of the islands. G√°lvez turned over the task to Casimiro G√≥mez Ortega, head of the Real Jard√≠n Bot√°nico de Madrid. G√≥mez named Cu√©llar. Expedition to the Philippines Cu√©llar left the botanist position in Seville to take up the position in the Philippines. This was a scientific expedition at the same level as that of Ruiz and Pav√≥n, and Cu√©llar asked the king to give him the title of bot√°nico real (royal botanist). This the king did, without an actual salary, naming him bot√°nico real sin sueldo (royal botanist without pay). At the beginning of January 1786 Cu√©llar sailed on the √Åguila Imperial for Manila by way of the Cape of Good Hope. He was accompanied by his second wife, Mar√≠a Borb√≥n. On August 9, 1786, after seven months at sea, the ship arrived at Cavite, in the Philippines. On-going conflicts forced him to limit his initial explorations to the area around Manila. At first he concentrated on the cultivars in which the Compa√±√≠a took special interest: indigo, black pepper, cotton, mulberries, coffee and cacao. In March and April he went a little farther afield, to Bataan. From his arrival, Cu√©llar began collecting scientific materials to send back to Spain. The first specimens sent back were natural products of the Philippines, including seashells, seeds, resins, woods, drawings, minerals, and some living plants. These date from the beginning of 1787. Cu√©llar assiduously continued the shipments until 1797, overcoming some difficulties to do so. A royal order dated in January 1788 directed him to promote the cultivation of cinnamon and nutmeg, in a last attempt to break the Dutch commercial monopoly on these spices. However the varieties he was able to study were not suitable. On March 24, 1792, the corvettes Descubierta and Atrevida of the scientific expedition of Alejandro Malaspina arrived in Cavite. Cu√©llar met with the expedition, and showed its botanist, Antonio Pineda some of the plantations around Manila. The expedition sailed from Manila on November 15, 1792. Other expeditions The four expeditions authorized by King Carlos III to the Spanish colonies were those of Hip√≥lito Ruiz L√≥pez and Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n to Peru and Chile (1777‚Äì88); Jos√© Celestino Mutis to New Granada (1783-1808); Cu√©llar to the Philippines (1786‚Äì97); and Mart√≠n Sess√© y Lacasta to New Spain (1787-1803).Cuellar had done a great part for many people.

It is the first movie of Pasolini's Trilogy of life, the others being The Canterbury Tales and Arabian Nights. The tales contain abundant nudity, sex, slapstick and scatological humor. The film was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize. Plot The film, shot in Neapolitan dialect at the behest of the director, offers a variety of episodes from the stories in Giovanni Boccaccio's book, and are linked through a pupil of the painter Giotto (played by Pasolini himself) who arrives in Naples to paint a mural. In the first episode, Andreuccio of Perugia is cheated by a Neapolitan and dropped in a trough of excrement. The young man escapes and meets two thieves who are attempting a robbery at a nearby church to steal the jewels from the tomb of a bishop who died a few days earlier. Andreuccio is persuaded to participate and, with a brilliant ruse, manages to steal for himself the most beautiful ring of the deceased. In the second episode, a young man, Masetto da Lamporecchio, is encouraged by some nuns in a convent to have sex with them. In fact, the young man had already had this idea, and pretended to be deaf and dumb. The sisters prove insatiable, and the young man finally breaks his silence to protest that he cannot keep up with their demands. The mother prioress declares his sudden ability to speak a miracle from God, but this is merely an excuse to keep the young man at the convent. In the third episode, the commoner Peronella makes a cuckold of her dimwitted husband. While she is having sex with her lover, her husband unexpectedly comes home. The other man hides in a large pot while the husband reveals that he has a buyer for the pot with him. Peronella quickly says that she already has a buyer and that he is inspecting the pot. The husband accepts this and goes to the pot room where the stranger says the inside of the pot is dirty. The wife tells the husband to clean it before selling it, and while he is inside the pot, his wife and her lover loudly and passionately copulate next to it. The husband remains oblivious. In the fourth episode, set in France, Ser Ciappelletto, a merchant, is sent to make a deal. For most of his life, he had devoted his soul to sin, seduction and profit, disregarding all moral and ethical values. God punishes him with a serious illness that forces him to his death bed. But Ciappelletto wants to confess and calls a monk to tell him several lies that make him seem very pure, while pretending to cringe over venial sins. Because of these lies, the people consider him a holy man and after his death, Ciappelletto is revered as a saint. In the fifth episode, a young woman stays with her lover overnight on a terrace to make love without her parents' knowledge. The next morning the parents of the girl find the two lovers naked. However, they recognise the boy as a good match, as his marriage would earn a significant amount of money through dowry, and allow their daughter to marry him. In the sixth episode, set in Sicily, a girl, Elizabeth, attractive and possessing great wealth, falls in love with Lorenzo, a young employee of her brothers. However, her brothers discover their love and murder Lorenzo in order to save their family's honour. They bury Lorenzo's body far from home, but Elizabeth is led to the corpse of her beloved through a dream. When she finds the body Elizabeth cuts off Lorenzo's head, brings it back to her bedroom and hides it inside a pot of basil, which she tends to every day. In the seventh episode, the commoner Gemmata is deceived by a doctor into believing she can be turned into horse and then back into a human, so she can be used to sow the fields of her husband's farm. The spell is a ruse: the doctor has imagined a ritual to enable him to have sex with the woman, in full view of her husband. The eighth episode involves two characters from Naples who agree to tell each other about Paradise or Hell when they die. After a time, one of the two dies. The other is terrified of ending up in Hell because he had too many sexual relations. One night he has a dream in which his friend tells him that he is in Limbo, and that sex is not a mortal sin as they had believed. The final episode returns to the pupil of the painter Giotto, who has completed his fresco, which illustrates episodes of the film.

It is actually consisted of two families of vehicles with official designations in the People's Liberation Army as Type 90 and Type 92. Roughly 900 WZ-551s are in service with the PLA, where they are used by light mechanized infantry units. WZ-551s have been exported to Algeria, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan and Senegal.  Design  Produced by Norinco, the WZ-551 first appeared in 1984, but the Chinese military were not satisfied with its performance, and the design had to be modified. Modification is mostly concentrated on improving the chassis. The improved WZ-551A entered service in 1995 as the Type 92 IFV and Type 92A APC. It has a crew of three men, and is fully amphibious, being driven in the water by shrouded propellers. Constructed of welded steel plates, the interior is divided into three compartments. The driver and commander sit in the front, the engine is in the middle, and the passengers, equipment or turret basket is located in the rear. The automotive platform is a modified Chinese-made Tiema XC2030 6X6 truck, which is based on the conventional Mercedes-Benz 2026 truck. The IFV version is equipped with a ZPT-90 25 mm caliber cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun in a closed turret and it can carry 9 passengers. The 25x183mmB ZPT-90 is based on the Type 87 anti-aircraft cannon, which is a bored-out version of the Type 85 anti-aircraft cannon, itself is a direct copy of the Soviet 23x152mmB ZU-23-2. Some vehicle are even armed with the Type 87 instead of the ZPT-90. The cannon has a full 360¬∞ traverse with an elevation of -8¬∞ ~ 55¬∞. Ammunition load for the cannon is 400 rounds, with 200 rounds carried inside the ammunition cartridges, and an additional 200 (120 high-explosive rounds and 80 armour-piercing rounds) carried in the turret. The gun can fire single, 3-round burst, 5-round burst, or fully automatic. The maximum cyclic rate of fire is 200 rounds/min. Secondary weapon is a coaxial 7.62mm Type 86 machine gun with 1,000 rounds. The APC version has only a 12.7 mm machine gun but can carry 11 passengers. Additional versions include anti-tank missile, command, self-propelled artillery, air defense and armored recovery vehicles. Development =Prototype= Basic version of WZ-551 called Type 90 first appeared on the National Day of the People's Republic of China parade in 1984. During its service, it was discovered that the vehicle was underpowered and the cross country capability at high altitude terrain was not enough to meet the requirement. As a result, the planned 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 variants were canceled, and resources were concentrate on the improvement effort. However, the planned export version designated as ZSL-90 (also the industrial designation) was continued, and the vehicle was used as chassis for a variety weaponry platforms, such as command vehicle, ATGW carrier, self-propelled AAA, and ambulance. The most distinct visual difference between Type 90 and its successor Type 92 is that for Type 90, the distance between the first pair and the second pair of wheels is greater than the distance between the second pair and the third pair of wheels, while for Type 92, the distance is the same for all. Despite being used as a common chassis for many different platforms, the total number of vehicles of all types entering Chinese service is small due to its inherent problem, and with the exception of the basic APC version, no other versions of ZSL-90 is known to be exported due to the same reason. Years later, NGV-1 is the successor of Type 90. It was discovered that the cross country mobility was not the only thing that needed to be improved for WZ-551, firepower was also in need for improvement. The original Chinese manually operated 25-mm gun initially mounted on WZ-551 proved to be incapable of penetrating the armor plate of most of Soviet armored vehicles, and a more powerful small caliber gun that was able to defeat Soviet armor was needed, and China turned to west for help because its own technologies and industrial capabilities back in the 1980s could not fill the need in the required time. A deal was made with French firm GIAT to incorporate a GIAT 25-mm autocannon as the primary weapon for W-Z551 and the work on the redesign of WZ-551 begun in China even before the French gun was delivered. Due to the urgent need to meet the schedule, the GIAT 25-mm autocannon was airlifted to China, as opposed to delivery via cargo ships, the usual practice at the time. The development was completed and received state certification in October 1988, and the new vehicle was named as NGV-1, with N for Norinco, G for GIAT and V for vehicle. The remotely operated 25-mm autocannon was eventually reverse engineered in China after France withdrew from the program after 1989, and used to upgrade Type 92, another development of WZ-551. =Type 92= The redesigned ZSL-92 or Type 92 solved the problems of its predecessor Type 90 and was first revealed to the public in 1986, and entered Chinese service on larger scale than its predecessor. Just like Type 90, Type 92 is also used as a common chassis for many different weaponry platforms, such as command vehicle, ATGW carrier, self-propelled AAA, and ambulance. Additionally, the canceled 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 versions were realized in Type 92 program as WZ550 and WZ552. The industrial designation VN2A is also used for the export version of Type 92, following earlier practice. The chassis of Type 92 comes in three variations: * the 4X4 APC looks like the VAB, used mostly by the Chinese police, but also used as self-propelled SAM chassis. * the 6X6 APC or MICV. This was the baseline and also the first of the series. * the 8x8 variant =Yitian Upgrade= In 2005, another mobile land based air defense variant of TY-90 was revealed to the Chinese public, named as YT ADS, short for Yi-Tian (ÂÄöÂ§©, meaning leaning on the sky) Air Defense System. YT ADS is a development of earlier LS ADS designed to specifically address the shortcomings of the latter, namely, the insufficient armor protection, lack of amphibious capability and radar. Like its predecessor LS ADS, the system is also developed by Norinco. Weaponry of YT ADS is similar to that of earlier LS ADS, with the missile configuration remains the same as that of LS ADS, but additionally, there is an extra 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and 3 smoke grenade dischargers as secondary armament for added protection. WZ-551 is utilized as the chassis of the YT ADS, giving the system amphibious capability and added protection. Additionally, a light solid state 3-D passive phased array radar is added to the fire control system, just above the original electro-optical fire control system, providing the ADS with greater surveillance range. The radar can be fold down for traveling and transportation. Specifications: * Maximum target altitude: 4 km * Minimum target altitude: 15 meter * Maximum target range: 6 km * Minimum target range: 300 meter * Maximum target speed: > 400 meter / second * Maximum radar searching range: >20 km * Maximum radar tracking range: 10 ‚Äì 12 km * System reaction time: 6 ‚Äì 8 seconds Variants =Domestic= A Chinese HJ-9 anti- tank missile system mounted on a WZ550 4x4 vehicle.

On their way south, Tomaszewski's mother Anna, pregnant with Irena, and her two sisters Wanda and Halina, were separated from the children's father, Felix. In 1949, after six years in an East Africa refugee camp, the family were reunited in England, and subsequently emigrated to Canada. Career Tomaszewski was a founding president of the Canadian Foundation for Polish Studies. She co-authored, with Tecia Werbowski, Codename ≈ªegota: Rescuing Jews in Occupied Poland, 1942-1945, on a clandestine organization that helped Jews in Poland. Tomaszewski wrote the screenplay for the 1999 film based on the book, titled ≈ªegota: The Council for Aid to Jews in Occupied Poland, 1942-45. She translated the text and acted as editor for Inside a Gestapo Prison: The Letters of Krystyna Wituska, 1942-1944, published by Wayne State University Press in 2006. The Tomaszewski translation was published earlier in 1997 under the title, I Am First a Human Being: The Prison Letters of Krystyna Wituska. Books in Canada reviewed the work, noting that Tomaszewski first came across the letters while working on a documentary on Poland for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The translation draws on the earlier Polish language book by Dr. Wanda Kiedrzynska and from others who knew or were related to Wituska. The book also contains an explanatory list of people mentioned in the correspondence. She is the editor of the Cosmopolitan Review, the quarterly, English-language magazine on Polish affairs. In 1999, Tomaszewski was invited to give the ninth Milewski Polish Studies Lecture at Central Connecticut State University on the topic of: \\"The Holocaust: Remembrance and Education\\". Professor Stanislaus Blejwas, in his introduction to the published address, called Tomaszewski one of the thoughtful voices in the discussion between Jews and Poles about the Holocaust. In 2014, Tomaszewski was the keynote speaker at the opening of Toronto's presentation of an exhibit about Jan Karski, \\"The World Knew ‚Äì Jan Karski‚Äôs Mission for Humanity\\". Along with Polish writer, Ma≈Çgorzata Dzieduszycka-Ziemilska, she was instrumental in encouraging contact and dialogue between Jewish students and Polish students during the annual March of the Living program.

In his youth he joined Center for Cultural Action (CACF) in Funchal and connected with older artists. Rigo arrived in San Francisco in 1985, using the name Rigo 85. He earned a BFA degree from San Francisco Art Institute in 1991, and an MFA degree from Stanford University in 1997.\\"Walls with Tongues: Muralist RIGO 02 Speaks\\" by Siobhan Fleming, Comet Magazine 3, 2002.

Career = San Francisco murals = Rigo is one of the founding members of Clarion Alley Mural Project collective in 1992 and is still an active member, as of 2017. He is considered by some art critics and curators to be part of the first generation of the San Francisco Mission School art movement.\\"The Mission school\\" by Glen Helfand, San Francisco Bay Guardian, October 28, 2002.Reader responses to \\"Marketing the Mission\\", Stretcher.org, January 17, 2005. Many of Rigo's 20+ murals are located in the South of Market (SOMA) neighborhood in San Francisco. The first of a series of San Francisco murals, the forty foot tall shield-shaped street sign mural \\"Innercity Home\\" (1995) is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood and can be seen from a distance when entering the city on the freeway. The San Francisco pop art mural \\"One Tree\\" (1995) was one of his more iconic works, it was located near a freeway ramp at 10th and Bryant streets and featuring a mural of a street sign pointing to a single tree which grew nearby. In 2012, additional trees were planted near the mural which had previously featured only a single tree, and by 2017, the mural was deconstructed, cut and moved to point the pointing sign to the freeway ramp. = Political art = Rigo's artwork has highlighted world politics and political prisoners, from the Black Panthers and the Angola Three to Mumia Abu-Jamal, whose conviction for the murder of a policeman is contested, and the American Indian Movement's Leonard Peltier. Rigo create a controversial statue of Peltier that was removed from the grounds of the American University in January 2017. In 2005, he created a statue based on the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute titled Victory Salute, a twenty-two foot tall monument of two men: Tommie Smith and John Carlos. In the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, these men each raised a black-gloved fist for human rights. Their simple gesture of the hand is considered as one of the most controversial statements of political and social activism in Olympic history. Victory Salute is a monument of that moment which was specifically built on the San Jose State University campus because Smith and Carlos were both student-athletes at the college. = Other work = Rigo is an occasional professor at the San Francisco Art Institute.\\"Clarion Alley Mural Project\\" by Megan Wilson, MeganWilson.com, 2006.

The ferry is operated by a contractor for the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Parker's Ferry on the Meherrin River near Winton, NC Parker's Ferry connects Maney's Neck, formed by the confluence of the Meherrin and Chowan Rivers, with the southern part of Hertford County. The ferry is reached (on the south bank) by Parkers Ferry Road, which crosses the Meherrin River just above its confluence with the Chowan River and just below the confluence of Potecasi Creek and (on the north bank) by Parkers Fishery Road (Hertford SR 1306). It is one of three remaining cable ferries left in operation in North Carolina. The others are the Sans Souci Ferry and Elwell Ferry. The ferry is not considered part of the state ferry system which operates ferries along the immediate NC coast. The NC cable ferries are considered inland ferries and are operated by regional DOT divisional offices instead of the NC DOT Ferry Division. Operations The ferry is powered by a diesel engine and propeller and guided by a steel cable that is stretched loosely across the river. The cable is secured on each side of the river by steel posts and as the ferry crosses the river, the force of the boat, with the help of rollers on the side of the boat, pulls the normally submerged cable out of the water. The cable is permanently secured to the ferry and allows for the boat to not stray off course in normal river currents. The ferry only carries two cars at its maximum and does not operate in high water conditions or storms for the threat of the cable snapping in treacherous conditions is too great. Persons wanting to ride the ferry that happen to be on the opposite side of the river than the ferry must blow their horn to summon the ferry. The ferry is free of charge. The ferry operates almost every day except for days of high water and bad weather. The Ferry is on land that was part of the Meherrin Indian Reservation. The Meherrin now live about 10 miles away in the Winton area. Vessel description The ferry consists of a steel barge that cars drive onto. Off to one side of the boat is an \\"engine room\\" where the operator sits and controls the boat's engine, which actually sits outside beside the room. The ferry is powered by a diesel engine. The operator must know when to let off the throttle, since the ferry has no brakes or on board steering device. In the early days the ferry was made of wood.

(officially written and stylized as ultraelectromagneticpop!) is the debut studio album of the Filipino alternative rock band Eraserheads, released by BMG Records (Pilipinas), Inc. in 1993. Ultraelectromagneticpop! spawned hit songs such as \\"Ligaya\\", \\"Toyang\\", and \\"Pare Ko\\". The album brought the underground Philippine college rock scene into public awareness and the emergence of \\"Eraserheadsmania\\" because of successive hit singles and sold-out concerts. Background Though Ultraelectromagneticpop! was their debut album, most of the songs were recycled from original compositions that were written since their college days in 1989. Hoping to have their songs published, the band recorded a demo tape in 1991 and shopped around record labels and radio stations, only to be rejected at every turn. A friend-professor, Robin Rivera, from their school, UP Diliman, helped them record an improved version of the demo tape which was named Pop U!, a play on the invective \\"fuck you,\\" in response to the people who turned them down. After a year of being passed around the underground music scene, the demo tape made its way to the hands of BMG Records (Philippines), who signed a three-year contract with the band. The title of the album is a pun on ultraelectromagnetic tops, a fictional weapon from the anime serial Voltes V, which was immensely popular in the Philippines. Recording The recording of Ultraelectromagneticpop started on July 1992 to April 1993 with crazy working titles like \\"Lutong Bahay\\", \\"Pekaloid\\", \\"The Klasik Kapums Konsert Kookout\\", and \\"Eraserheads Greatest Hits Vol. 5\\". at Ad & Ad Recording Studio and JR Recording Studio. Based on their production notes, they somewhat had a hard time during their recording sessions. It was stated that there are two things on their recording sessions : Heaven and Hell. Hell: Ac and Ad.

The album was originally issued on both compact disc and cassette tape formats with the respective catalog numbers: MRCD-032 and MRMC-032. Original issue cassettes featured full-color sticker labels on both sides. In 2008, the album was re- released together with the band's other albums. =25th anniversary remastered version= Coinciding with the album's 25th anniversary, a remastered edition of Ultraelectromagneticpop is set to be released on November 21, 2018 under Sony Music Philippines and Offshore Music. Ely Buendia made the first announcement on his Instagram and Facebook accounts. The album was remastered by Grammy award-winning American audio engineer Bernie Grundman. In January 2019, Buendia revealed through his independent record label, Offshore Music, along with Sony Music, that the master tapes of the Eraserheads' first album, Ultraelectromagneticpop!, are currently being archived by the University of the Philippines Center for Ethnomusicology for the album's cultural significance.

The character is loosely based on the real life polygamist leader Warren Jeffs. Overview The character of Alby Grant was first introduced in the show's pilot episode. He is a hard-line member of the fictional polygamist group United Effort Brotherhood (UEB) and is one of the many sons of Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton), the \\"Prophet\\" of the organization. His mother is Roman's sixth wife, Adaleen (Mary Kay Place), and Nicki (Chlo√´ Sevigny), Bill Henrickson's second wife, is his sister. Tall and slender, Alby has a pale, smooth-featured face, sleek brown hair, and cold brown eyes. Alby, who usually accompanies his aging father on rounds, sees himself as being groomed for the sect's number one position. Both Roman and Alby dislike protagonist Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton), whom they view as morally wayward, anti-compound, and disloyal, among other things. Bill is a successful business entrepreneur, owning the popular home improvement warehouse Henrickson's Home Plus. After Bill refuses to give Roman a percentage of his income on his second store, Roman dispatches Alby to help him take care of the situation. Alby engages in many schemes to intimidate Bill, including scaring his kids. After failing numerous times to persuade Bill to submit to his father's payment demands, Alby loses his father's favor, which results in him taking a sabbatical. During his sabbatical he has an encounter with a street hustler (Kevin Alejandro) at a market, leading the man to believe he was being hired for sex. The man then makes a sexual advance on him, which Alby reluctantly, and dramatically, rejects by shrieking loudly and banging his head against a hotel wall. In the second season, Alby's closeted homosexuality is alluded to again by him checking out the bodies of other men and comments made by his sister Nicki. During the final episode of the first season his father asks him to find new methods to punish both Bill and his ally brother Joey (Shawn Doyle), who lives on the compound with his wife Wanda (Melora Walters) and their baby. Bill and Joey's interest in a UEB Priesthood seat arouses caution in Roman, who believes Bill is setting up a plot against his interests. Alby begins his investigation by spooking Wanda by materializing inside her home, looking for Bill and her husband. Wanda tells him that Joey is not home. An impatient Alby snoops around her house and then approaches her newborn child, insinuating that he will do whatever is necessary to persuade her to cooperate. Wanda responds by making a fake phone call to Joey, urging him to come home. She then offers Alby lemonade, which is spiked with anti-freeze; it sends him into a coma and nearly kills him. The second season shows a fully recovered Alby set for implacable vengeance on those who wronged him, particularly Bill. Although Alby knows that Wanda is responsible for his poisoning, he does little to punish her for reason that he is aware of her mental instability and therefore believes someone must have put her up to the task. Also, Alby sees the attempt on his life as a political opportunity to rid Juniper Creek of people he dislikes or sees as a threat to him. Although uncertain as to whether Bill played a role in the attempt on his life, he does, however, believe fully that he is trying to cover up the situation. Eventually the blame goes to Joey, who takes the blame in order to keep his unstable wife from going to jail- however, it is uncovered that the murder attempt was fully Wanda's doing. Alby, however, is unsatisfied and wants Bill punished. Once again, Alby resorts to terror tactics against Bill's family by spooking his daughter Sarah (Amanda Seyfried). Bill learns of the incident and has a violent confrontation with Alby, bruising him badly. After his father's assassination attempt, Alby made a power move, and to Bill's horror, successfully maneuvers himself to the sect's number one position. With his bullet-ridden father in the hospital, Alby became the series' primary villain. During the third season Alby is shown to run the UEB with an iron fist, crushing all dissent with exile and excommunication. One of the main plot lines of the third season revolves around a Mormon document that implies that the LDS Church faked their renouncement of polygamy in order to get Utah formally recognized as a state. Bill acquires the document, hoping that it will set the LDS church straight. This leads to problems in the Henrickson household, culminating in Barbara Henrickson (Jeanne Tripplehorn) being excommunicated from the LDS Church. Hollis Greene (Luke Askew) (the \\"Prophet\\" of a rival polygamous group) also wants the document and resorts to kidnapping the adopted daughter of Ted Price (Patrick Fabian) (Bill's brother-in-law; a respected member of the LDS church) to force Bill to give it up. However, upon being given the document, they reveal that it is a forgery and that Alby faked the document in order to con money out of the church. The situation of Alby's family betrayal and power move causes his mother to put herself in a self- imposed exile, where she hires a contract killer (Dan Lemieux) to assassinate her wayward son. The assassin, pretending to be a man interested in having sex with Alby at a rest area bathroom, fails at his attempt, leaving Alby more paranoid. Alby finds out about the conspiracy and with his second wife Lura (Anne Dudek) he slowly plots a calculating vengeance. Lura is Alby's closest confidant and she has considerable influence on his political decisions. The final episode of third season reveals that he will strike Adaleen with a homemade bomb that he and Lura have been constructing. The bomb, which is concealed in an envelope and designed to detonate the instant the envelope is opened (or stepped on), is placed by Alby outside the hotel room door where Adaleen is staying. Alby becomes scared as he sees a Hispanic housekeeper appear close by doing her rounds. Not wanting any collateral damage Alby shouts quietly \\"v√°yase! v√°yase!\\" (\\"Go Away! Go Away!\\"). The housekeeper proceeds on towards Alby anyway and rolls her cleaning cart over the bomb causing Alby to frantically duck for cover. The bomb does not yet go off, causing Alby to release his guard just a second or two before the bomb does detonate, hurting both him and the housekeeper, and leaving Adaleen unscathed. The start of the fourth season shows Alby fully recovered from the explosion. He learns from Nicki that his father is no more (Roman was murdered by Joey via suffocation at the end of third season). He and Lura are blissful about the news and make almost no attempt at hiding their feelings from the dismayed Nicki. Alby, with the help of Lura, quickly makes his move to become the next prophet. Alby makes a calculating move and moves his father's corpse to Idaho to the Hendrickson's newly opened, but still under construction, casino, in the hopes it will ruin his nemesis. When a construction worker (Van Epperson) discovers Roman in a lawn chair, Bill is able to prevent the FBI from finding Roman before he seemingly returns Roman's body to Juniper Creek. The start of the fourth season also shows Alby having sex with a traveling businessman named Dale Tomasson (Ben Koldyke) whom he meets at a park. Both are stunned when Bill introduces them (Dale is an attorney that has been assigned to be the trustee of the UEB in Roman's \\"absence\\"). Alby rejects the trusteeship and accuses Bill of being the mastermind behind Roman's absence and the FBI raids that recently took place at Juniper Creek (They were investigating Roman's disappearance). It is also revealed that Dale leads a reparative therapy group for homosexuals. Despite his efforts, Alby is relentless in pursuing Dale for sex and comfort. It is apparent that the two love each other; they have numerous sexual encounters and it seems that Dale may start to wield influence over Alby's politics, as he suggests him to reform and unify his hard-line church. While dressing, Alby experiences a moment of what appears to be schizophrenia. His father is berating him for his homosexual activity and advises him to commit suicide for the sake of his wives and mother. In the meantime, Alby forces his mother to marry JJ (≈Ωeljko Ivanek), Nicki's first husband and father of Nicki's first daughter, Cara Lynn. The affair with Dale goes on, one day Alby sneaks into Dale's house and surprises him with a gift and home-cooked meal, but when he spies papers about Dale's work with the UEB he sees again Roman Grant insulting him and takes off. He returns later and confronts Dale about cooperating with Bill to break up the compound. Alby defends the Principle and Dale convinces him they can reform, not destroy. Alby seems now to accept his feelings for Dale, considering him the answers to his prayers and starts to live their relationship with much more serenity (he stops seeing his father, he rents an apartment in Salt Lake City) than Dale, who has always struggled consciously against his sexuality. Alby's wife Lura observes Alby's change of attitude and decides to investigate and finds out about his homosexual affair. Rumors start to spread, and Bill confronts Dale, who admits having seen the de facto Prophet just to convince him to cooperate. When Lura tells Bill that Dale is gay, he confronts him one more time, and this time Bill asks Dale if he's having sex with Alby. He admits it and asks to keep it private. Bill passes no judgment and admits to him that he also struggles with demons. Unfortunately, Lura tells everything to Dale's wife. Realizing that his life is now destroyed, he kills himself. Alby shockingly finds Dale's body hanging from the roof beam of their apartment. During the trial on Dale's death, Alby is questioned about the apartment where the trustee was found; as a matter of fact it had been rented with the U.E.B. funds, and he lies, denying to have anything to do with it. Back to the compound, while he is despairing about his loss, Lura asks forgiveness, without saying for what, and then announces Nicki. Nicki comes in and asks her brother to leave the compound to start a new life, the two seems to connect but suddenly Roman's ghost appears to Alby, pointing out how love only brings sorrow. Alby surrenders to his paranoia and chases Nicki away. In the fourth and fifth seasons, Alby becomes a fugitive as the FBI indicts him on various crimes, including murder, tax evasion, spousal abuse and arrangements of illegal marriages between his adult male followers and underage girls.

They resorted to drastic measures (including renting out the supposedly haunted Clearwell Castle to live in) to inspire him. The song has been singled out for praise by hard rock and heavy metal guitar players, with Slash from Guns N' Roses stating to Guitar World in 2008, \\"The outro to 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' is the heaviest shit I have ever heard in my life.

During the Heaven & Hell Tour, it was brought back for a number of shows, then dropped. On the Cross Purposes tour, it usually closed shows, while on the Forbidden tour, it was played in the middle of the setlist and featured additional guitar by Geoff Nicholls. During the band's late-1990s Reunion tour, the song was played but shortened, skipping the final verse due to Osbourne's diminishing vocal range.

The show was formerly on ESPN Radio from 2006-2012. Since debuting on November 13, 2006, the host of the program has been hosted by former Oklahoma State Cowboys guard and current Fox Sports college basketball analyst Doug Gottlieb. Jon Stashower was the SportsCenter anchor for the show in the 8pm-11pm slot until 2008, when he was moved to the afternoon spot allowing anchors Marc Kestecher and Neil Jackson to split the time between 8pm-11pm. He rejoined the show on February 2, 2009 when it was moved to its earlier slot. The debuting of The Doug Gottlieb Show, caused a major shake up in the ESPN Radio lineup, as SportsNation on ESPN Radio was dropped completely from the airwaves and The Brian Kenny Show was created to take up the later slot, from 8pm-10pm. Since joining ESPN Radio in September 2003, Gottlieb had co-hosted GameNight along with personalities such as Chuck Wilson, Jeff Rickard, John Seibel and Freddie Coleman. Due to Gottlieb's extensive work for ESPN's college basketball coverage, the primary fill-in host for the program during the evening was Andy Gresh but since Gresh's departure from ESPN Radio, Jason Smith was the regular substitute for Gottlieb. On July 31, 2012 it was announced that Gottlieb had signed with CBS and would no longer be appearing on ESPN. His last show on ESPN was July 30, and his first with CBS was January 2, 2013.http://www.cbsradio.com/single- press/1832?filter=2012 Gottlieb joined Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports Radio on March 22, 2017. His last show at CBS Sports Radio was on April 14, 2017. Design The design of The Doug Gottlieb Show is very caller friendly with many segments and features containing calls and e-mails from listeners. Gottlieb, with his unique opinions, often includes pop culture and personal commentaries in the show.

Definitions Let f, f_n\\\\ (n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N): X \\\\to \\\\mathbb R be measurable functions on a measure space (X, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu). The sequence f_n is said to converge globally in measure to f if for every \\\\epsilon > 0, :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X: f(x)-f_n(x)\\\\geq \\\\varepsilon\\\\\\\\}) = 0, and to converge locally in measure to f if for every \\\\epsilon>0 and every F \\\\in \\\\Sigma with \\\\mu (F) < \\\\infty, :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{x \\\\in F: f(x)-f_n(x)\\\\geq \\\\varepsilon\\\\\\\\}) = 0. Convergence in measure can refer to either global convergence in measure or local convergence in measure, depending on the author. Properties Throughout, f and fn (n \\\\in N) are measurable functions X -> R. * Global convergence in measure implies local convergence in measure. The converse, however, is false; i.e., local convergence in measure is strictly weaker than global convergence in measure, in general. * If, however, \\\\mu (X)<\\\\infty or, more generally, if f and all the fn vanish outside some set of finite measure, then the distinction between local and global convergence in measure disappears. * If Œº is œÉ-finite and (fn) converges (locally or globally) to f in measure, there is a subsequence converging to f almost everywhere. The assumption of œÉ-finiteness is not necessary in the case of global convergence in measure. * If Œº is œÉ-finite, (fn) converges to f locally in measure if and only if every subsequence has in turn a subsequence that converges to f almost everywhere. * In particular, if (fn) converges to f almost everywhere, then (fn) converges to f locally in measure. The converse is false. * Fatou's lemma and the monotone convergence theorem hold if almost everywhere convergence is replaced by (local or global) convergence in measure. * If Œº is œÉ-finite, Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem also holds if almost everywhere convergence is replaced by (local or global) convergence in measure. * If X = [a,b] ‚äÜ R and Œº is Lebesgue measure, there are sequences (gn) of step functions and (hn) of continuous functions converging globally in measure to f. * If f and fn (n ‚àà N) are in Lp(Œº) for some p > 0 and (fn) converges to f in the p-norm, then (fn) converges to f globally in measure. The converse is false. * If fn converges to f in measure and gn converges to g in measure then fn \\\\+ gn converges to f + g in measure. Additionally, if the measure space is finite, fngn also converges to fg. Counterexamples Let X = \\\\mathbb R, Œº be Lebesgue measure, and f the constant function with value zero. * The sequence f_n = \\\\chi_{[n,\\\\infty)} converges to f locally in measure, but does not converge to f globally in measure. * The sequence f_n = \\\\chi_{\\\\left[\\\\frac{j}{2^k},\\\\frac{j+1}{2^k}\\\\right]} where k = \\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 n\\\\rfloor and j=n-2^k (The first five terms of which are \\\\chi_{\\\\left[0,1\\\\right]},\\\\;\\\\chi_{\\\\left[0,\\\\frac12\\\\right]},\\\\;\\\\chi_{\\\\left[\\\\frac12,1\\\\right]},\\\\;\\\\chi_{\\\\left[0,\\\\frac14\\\\right]},\\\\;\\\\chi_{\\\\left[\\\\frac14,\\\\frac12\\\\right]}) converges to 0 globally in measure; but for no x does fn(x) converge to zero. Hence (fn) fails to converge to f almost everywhere. * The sequence f_n = n\\\\chi_{\\\\left[0,\\\\frac1n\\\\right]} converges to f almost everywhere and globally in measure, but not in the p-norm for any p \\\\geq 1.  Topology  There is a topology, called the topology of (local) convergence in measure, on the collection of measurable functions from X such that local convergence in measure corresponds to convergence on that topology. This topology is defined by the family of pseudometrics : \\\\\\\\{\\\\rho_F : F \\\\in \\\\Sigma,\\\\ \\\\mu (F) < \\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, where : \\\\rho_F(f,g) = \\\\int_F \\\\min\\\\\\\\{f-g,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\, d\\\\mu. In general, one may restrict oneself to some subfamily of sets F (instead of all possible subsets of finite measure). It suffices that for each G\\\\subset X of finite measure and \\\\varepsilon > 0 there exists F in the family such that \\\\mu(G\\\\setminus F)<\\\\varepsilon. When \\\\mu(X) < \\\\infty , we may consider only one metric \\\\rho_X, so the topology of convergence in finite measure is metrizable. If \\\\mu is an arbitrary measure finite or not, then : d(f,g) := \\\\inf\\\\limits_{\\\\delta>0} \\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{f-g\\\\geq\\\\delta\\\\\\\\}) + \\\\delta still defines a metric that generates the global convergence in measure.Vladimir I. Bogachev, Measure Theory Vol. I, Springer Science & Business Media, 2007 Because this topology is generated by a family of pseudometrics, it is uniformizable. Working with uniform structures instead of topologies allows us to formulate uniform properties such as Cauchyness. References * D.H. Fremlin, 2000. Measure Theory. Torres Fremlin. * H.L.

Between 1990 and 1999, he had his greatest chart success recording for Universal Music Group Nashville's MCA and Decca branches, with a total of eight albums between those two labels. During this timespan, Chesnutt also charted twenty top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, of which eight reached number one: \\"Brother Jukebox\\", \\"I'll Think of Something\\", \\"It Sure Is Monday\\", \\"Almost Goodbye\\", \\"I Just Wanted You to Know\\", \\"Gonna Get a Life\\", \\"It's a Little Too Late\\", and a cover of Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\". His first three albums for MCA (Too Cold at Home, Longnecks & Short Stories, and Almost Goodbye) along with a 1996 Greatest Hits package issued on Decca are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); 1994's What a Way to Live, also issued on Decca, is certified gold. After a self-titled album in 2002 on Columbia Records, Chesnutt has continued to record predominantly on independent labels. Chesnutt is known for his neotraditionalist country and honky-tonk influences, with frequent stylistic comparisons to George Jones. He has recorded several cover songs as both singles and album cuts, including covers of Hank Williams Jr., John Anderson, Don Gibson, Conway Twitty, and Charlie Rich. Artists with whom he has collaborated include Jones, Tracy Byrd, Vince Gill, and Alison Krauss. Mark Wright produced all but one of his albums released in the 1990s, while his work since 2005 has been produced by Jimmy Ritchey. Chesnutt has also won two awards from the Country Music Association: the Horizon Award (now known as Best New Artist) and Vocal Event of the Year, both in 1993. Biography Mark Nelson Chesnutt was born on September 6, 1963, in Beaumont, Texas. He drew musical influence from his father, Bob Chesnutt, who was a singer and record collector. Chesnutt first played drums as a child after receiving a drum kit as a Christmas gift, but at his father's persuasion, he stopped playing drums and chose to focus on singing instead. He dropped out of school in the eleventh grade to begin playing in clubs around southeast Texas. When he turned 17, his father began to take him to Nashville, Tennessee, to begin recording. For the next ten years, he began to record on small regional labels while he was the house band for local Beaumont nightclub Cutters. By the late 1980s, he had released eight singles, which would later be released together as an album titled Doing My Country Thing. Record producer Tony Brown heard one of Chesnutt's independent releases, and recommended him to Mark Wright, a songwriter, session musician, and record producer who helped Chesnutt sign with the Nashville branch of MCA Records in 1990. The same year, Bob Chesnutt died of a heart attack. Musical career =Too Cold at Home= Chesnutt released his major-label debut Too Cold at Home in 1990. It accounted for five chart singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. The title track (written by Bobby Harden of The Harden Trio) was released first, achieving a peak of number three on that chart, while reaching number one on the country music charts published by Radio & Records, Gavin Report, and Cashbox. The second single was \\"Brother Jukebox\\", which was written by Paul Craft, originally released as a single by Don Everly of The Everly Brothers in 1977,Whitburn, p. 122 and also recorded by Keith Whitley on his 1989 album I Wonder Do You Think of Me. Chesnutt's rendition of the song became his first number-one single on Hot Country Songs in 1991, while \\"Blame It on Texas\\", \\"Your Love Is a Miracle\\", and \\"Broken Promise Land\\" all peaked within the top ten of the same chart by year's end. Contributing musicians to Too Cold at Home included Richard Bennett, David Briggs, Mark O'Connor, Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins, Matt Rollings, Brent Rowan, and Glenn Worf. Wright produced the album, provided background vocals on some tracks, and wrote or co-wrote five of its ten tracks, including both \\"Blame It on Texas\\" and \\"Your Love Is a Miracle\\". Also included on the album was Chesnutt's rendition of \\"Friends in Low Places\\", which was released as a single in late 1990 by Garth Brooks. Too Cold at Home was met with generally positive critical and commercial reception. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly praised Chesnutt's singing voice and honky-tonk style, but felt that the album had too many cover songs. Brian Mansfield of AllMusic compared the album's sound to Western swing and George Jones. In 1994, Too Cold at Home earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for U.S. shipments of one million copies. In addition, the Country Music Association nominated him for the 1991 Horizon Award (now known as Best New Artist). =Longnecks & Short Stories= Chesnutt's second album, 1992's Longnecks & Short Stories, also earned a platinum certification. In order of release, its singles were \\"Old Flames Have New Names\\", \\"I'll Think of Something\\", \\"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\\", and \\"Ol' Country\\" (also written by Harden). \\"I'll Think of Something\\", previously a single for Hank Williams Jr. in 1974,Whitburn, pp. 398-399 became Chesnutt's second number-one single on Billboard in 1992. The album included many of the same session musicians as its predecessor, along with guest vocals from George Jones on \\"Talkin' to Hank\\", and both Alison Krauss and Vince Gill on \\"It's Not Over\\". The latter was originally recorded by Reba McEntire, while the closing track \\"Who Will the Next Fool Be?\\" was originally recorded by Charlie Rich. Chesnutt noted in a 1992 news article in The Tennessean that \\"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\\" (written by Dennis Linde) had been released as a single due to high demand from fans, and that he was pleased to have recorded a duet with Jones, whom he considered a musical idol. He also noted that \\"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\\" had been serviced \\"as a joke\\" by Nashville song promoters and was not taken seriously by other artists, but he felt that the song had potential. Mansfield wrote in AllMusic that the album \\"heralded the emergence of a Texas voice that contained both the knack for humor... and the depth for heartache\\". Nash praised the song variety, highlighting the singles and \\"It's Not Over\\" in particular, but felt that Chesnutt's voice was \\"a little too laid back\\". =Almost Goodbye= Chestnutt's third album for MCA was Almost Goodbye. Released in 1993, it produced three straight number-one singles on Hot Country Singles & Tracks: \\"It Sure Is Monday\\" (also written by Linde), the title track, and \\"I Just Wanted You to Know\\". The album's final single, a cover of Don Gibson's 1972 single \\"Woman (Sensuous Woman)\\", was less successful on the charts. The album also became his third to be certified platinum. Brian Mansfield wrote of the album in AllMusic that \\"Weak material weighs down Chesnutt's third release, though he still sings them like the most romantic western swinger since George Strait.\\" He praised the title track for its string section, but criticized the uptempo material as being inferior to \\"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\\" and \\"Old Flames Have New Names\\". Nash felt that the album was \\"class-A honky-tonk, ballad, and Texas swing, delivered by a guy whose instincts are usually as sure as his pitch\\", but criticized the lyrics of the closing track \\"The Will\\". Also in 1993, Chesnutt won two awards from the Country Music Association: the Horizon Award, and Vocal Event of the Year for George Jones' 1992 single \\"I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair\\", which featured Chesnutt as one of several guest vocalists and was awarded to all participants on the song. Following the success of Almost Goodbye, Chesnutt embarked on his first headlining tours in 1994, a move which Chesnutt later said inspired him to focus more on songwriting due to the minimal profitability from touring. =What a Way to Live= Chesnutt performing at Camp Humphreys in 2010. In 1994, MCA revived the Nashville branch of Decca Records and moved Chesnutt to it. His first Decca album, What a Way to Live, came out that year. The album included four singles: \\"She Dreams\\", \\"Goin' Through the Big D\\", \\"Gonna Get a Life\\", and \\"Down in Tennessee\\". Of these, \\"She Dreams\\" was previously a single in 1993 for its co-writer Tim Mensy,Whitburn, p. 238 while \\"Down in Tennessee\\" was previously a single for John Anderson in 1985.Whitburn, pp. 23-24 \\"Gonna Get a Life\\" was the most successful of the singles, reaching the top of the Billboard country charts in 1995. Two other cover songs were included on the album as well: the title track was originally recorded by Willie Nelson in 1960, while a cover of Waylon Jennings' 1974 single \\"Rainy Day Woman\\" included Jennings on duet vocals and lead guitar. Chesnutt said that he chose to record the Jennings cover at the suggestion of his managers while listening to Jennings' albums on his tour bus, and that Wright was responsible for making arrangements for Jennings to appear on the song. The album received a positive review from David Zimmerman of Gannett News Service, who praised the variety of traditional-leaning country sounds and Chesnutt's singing voice. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less favorable, stating that the album \\"is dogged by inconsistent material, but Chesnutt's fine singing manages to save most of the weaker material from being a bore.\\" What a Way to Live earned a gold certification from the RIAA in 1995 for shipments of 500,000 copies. =Wings and Greatest Hits= His next album, Wings, came out in 1995. For this album, Tony Brown served as producer instead of Wright. According to Chesnutt, he chose a different producer because Wright had wanted to push him to a more country pop style, a change with which Chesnutt disagreed. Page 1 page 2 Chesnutt noted that the album was completed more quickly than his previous ones: while the others took an average of two months to complete due to him having to schedule recording sessions around tour dates, he was able to complete Wings in only ten consecutive days. He also took most of April and May 1995 off from touring, and resumed in June on a tour that also featured Brooks & Dunn. Contributing songwriters on Wings included Jim Lauderdale and Mack Vickery. The first single was a cover of Todd Snider's \\"Trouble\\", which Chesnutt took to Top 20 of Hot Country Songs in 1995. The album's second single, \\"It Wouldn't Hurt to Have Wings\\", was a top-ten country hit, while followup \\"Wrong Place, Wrong Time\\" was less successful on the charts. Also included on the album was a cover of Hank Williams Jr.'s 1972 hit \\"Pride's Not Hard to Swallow.\\" Chesnutt co-wrote the track \\"As the Honky Tonk Turns\\", which he said was inspired by his early days singing in honky-tonk bars and observing the crowds. Rick Mitchell in The Encyclopedia of Country Music described it as a \\"honky-tonk concept album\\" that \\"bucked the commercial trend toward throwaway novelty tunes and lightweight country-pop.\\" The album received largely positive reviews from publications such as Country Standard Time, Billboard, and AllMusic, all of which praised the songwriting quality and honky-tonk stylings of the music, with the former two publications also considering it among the strongest album releases of the year. Decca issued a Greatest Hits package in 1996. This album reprised eight of his biggest hits and included two new songs in \\"It's a Little Too Late\\" and \\"Let It Rain\\"; both were released as singles, with the former becoming a number-one single on Billboard in 1997. At the time of this compilation's release, Chesnutt stated that he had toured almost nonstop for the past six years, and that he had wanted to take longer breaks between touring but was unable to since his album sales were not as strong as those of his contemporaries. Four years after its release, Greatest Hits became Chesnutt's fourth and final platinum album. =Thank God for Believers= In 1997, Chesnutt released Thank God for Believers, which reunited him with Wright on production duties. Of their reunion, Wright said that he felt that both of them were \\"on a downslide\\" prior to Wings, while Chesnutt said that \\"Mark and I kind of got away from each other for awhile because we needed it. We both lost a little bit of what we started together\\" and that, once the two started working together, \\"It was like we were never apart.\\" The album also featured several songs penned by Roger Springer, with whom Chesnutt soon developed a friendship and songwriting relationship. This album's title track, which also served as the lead single, ascended to the number two position on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts by the end of 1997. While finishing the album, Chesnutt and Wright chose to include the same recording of \\"It's Not Over\\" that had previously appeared on Longnecks & Short Stories to replace a song that the two felt did not fit with the rest of the album. \\"It's Not Over\\" was sent out as the second single from Thank God for Believers due to demand from radio listeners, a decision to which Chesnutt agreed because he felt that the song had potential as a single, and he was \\"disappointed\\" that it had not been a single from its original album. Two more singles followed in 1998: \\"I Might Even Quit Lovin' You\\" and \\"Wherever You Are\\". Nash called the album \\"a sometimes stunning reminder of the singer‚Äôs first-rate, smooth-as-bourbon interpretive style\\". Thom Owens wrote in AllMusic that the album was \\"strong, thoroughly enjoyable modern country.\\" =I Don't Want to Miss a Thing= Chesnutt topped the country music charts in early 1999 with a cover of \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\", originally recorded by the rock band Aerosmith (pictured here in 2007). In late 1998, Chesnutt recorded a cover version of Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" at the suggestion of Wright, who had heard the song on his car radio. Because the two thought that the song had potential as a single, Decca withdrew promotion of \\"Wherever You Are\\" in favor of the cover, which resulted in \\"Wherever You Are\\" becoming his first single not to make top 40 on the country music charts. Chesnutt said that he decided to cover the song because he felt that, despite his chart successes, he \\"wasn't getting noticed\\" due to the weaker sales of his last two albums compared to his first three. He felt that covering a pop song would \\"show people [he] could sing something other than the same old stuff\\", while also noting that many of his previous successful songs had been ballads. By early 1999, his version of \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" had reached the top of the Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts; it was also his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it ascended to No. 17. Despite showing favor toward the cover song at the time, he later expressed disdain for recording it; he told the blog Taste of Country in 2018 that he did not think that it fit his established style, that neither the single nor the corresponding album sold well despite the song's success at radio, and that he had refused offers from the label to release another cover of a pop song. The corresponding album, also titled I Don't Want to Miss a Thing, went on to account for only one other single in \\"This Heartache Never Sleeps\\". which reached top 20 on the country music charts. Nash wrote of the album that the cover was \\"a bit of a jolt\\", but added that Chesnutt \\"goes on to find enough snappy rhythm tunes and scampering Western swing to keep the toes tapping.\\" An uncredited review from People magazine praised Chesnutt's singing voice and the \\"good and varied songs\\". =Lost in the Feeling= In January 1999, MCA Nashville dissolved the Decca Nashville division. While most of the artists were dropped, Chesnutt was one of only three to move back to MCA, alongside Lee Ann Womack and Gary Allan. MCA released his album Lost in the Feeling in October 2000. The album included covers of two songs co-written and originally recorded by Shawn Camp on his 1993 self-titled debut album, which was also produced by Wright: \\"Fallin' Never Felt So Good\\" and \\"Confessin' My Love\\".Whitburn, p. 67 Also covered on the album were the title track, previously a single for Conway Twitty in 1983,Whitburn, pp. 372-373 and Gene Watson's 1975 single \\"Love in the Hot Afternoon\\".Whitburn, p. 386 \\"Fallin' Never Felt So Good\\" and \\"Lost in the Feeling\\" were both issued as singles, but neither made Top 40 of the country music charts. A review in Billboard was positive, stating that \\"seldom has he packed more authority and emotion into a recording\\", highlighting the cover songs in particular. Maria Konicki Dinoia of AllMusic also showed favor toward the cover songs while comparing Chesnutt's voice to that of Merle Haggard. Lost in the Feeling was commercially unsuccessful, and Chesnutt was dropped from MCA's roster one month after the album's release. Despite not being on a label at the time, he sang duet vocals on Tracy Byrd's early-2001 single \\"A Good Way to Get on My Bad Side\\", from Byrd's album Ten Rounds. =Mark Chesnutt= Chesnutt signed to Columbia Records in 2002 for the release of his self-titled studio album. The lead single \\"She Was\\" went to number 11 on Hot Country Singles & Tracks and number 62 on the Hot 100, while the followup singles \\"I Want My Baby Back\\" and \\"I'm in Love with a Married Woman\\" did not reach Top 40 of the former. To promote the album, Chesnutt went on a 75-date tour known as the Rockin' Roadhouse Tour, which also featured Joe Diffie and Tracy Lawrence. Billy Joe Walker Jr. produced the album, and contributing musicians included Aubrey Haynie, Brent Mason, and Dan Dugmore. Both William Ruhlmann of AllMusic and Peter Cooper of The Tennessean criticized the album for weak songwriting, while John Lupton of Country Standard Time felt that the album was \\"about average for him, but...it's an average that's usually a cut above.\\" Chesnutt later stated that he quickly left Columbia Records because executives had pressured him into recording more modern-sounding country pop instead of his traditional style, a concern that he had also had during his latter years at MCA. =Savin' the Honky Tonk and Heard It in a Love Song= Chesnutt's eleventh album, Savin' the Honky Tonk, was released in 2004 via the independent Vivaton! label. Jimmy Ritchey was the album's producer, and one of several contributing songwriters along with Chesnutt, Jerry Salley, Dean Miller, Jason Sellers, and Kevin Fowler. Chesnutt said that he intended for the album to be a return to the honky-tonk sounds of his earlier albums, and felt that being on an independent label allowed for him to record music that he wanted to record, as opposed to being pressured into recording songs that were forced upon him by major-label executives. The album accounted for three singles: \\"The Lord Loves the Drinkin' Man\\", \\"I'm a Saint\\", and \\"A Hard Secret to Keep\\". Erlewine said of the album that \\"Chesnutt not only sounds comfortable and relaxed, he's re-energized, both by the straight-ahead setting and the freedom to pick songs without an eye on the airwaves.\\" Robert Loy of Country Standard Time considered the disc a concept album, noting the unifying theme of alcohol consumption in most of the songs. Chesnutt toured small venues in 2004 and 2005 in support of the album. Heard It in a Love Song followed in 2006 on CBuJ Records. Its title track was previously a pop hit for The Marshall Tucker Band, and many of the other songs on the album were covers as well, including Charley Pride's \\"A Shoulder to Cry On\\" and Hank Williams's \\"Lost Highway\\". Barry Gilbert of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch rated the album \\"B\\", praising Chesnutt's singing voice and the contrast of the title track with the other cover songs. Mark Deming of AllMusic stated that \\"while Heard It in a Love Song lacks the hard country feel of [Savin' the Honky Tonk], it's a solid set that confirms the man's musical instincts are back on track.\\" =Rollin' with the Flow= Chesnutt signed to Lofton Creek Records in 2007. His only disc for the label was Rollin' with the Flow, the title track of which was a number-one single on the country charts for Charlie Rich in 1977. Chesnutt's version reached number 25 on the same chart in late 2007-early 2008, and \\"She Never Got Me Over You\\" made the charts as well. The album once again featured Jimmy Ritchey as producer, with contributing musicians including Glenn Worf, Brent Mason, Eddie Bayers, and Lonnie Wilson. Ritchey also co-wrote several songs on the album. Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote of the album that it was \\"as solid an album as Chesnutt's ever recorded ‚Äî which is saying plenty.\\" Writing for Roughstock, Matt Bjorke said that it was \\"the kind of record that traditionalist country fans dream about. It has something for all those fans\\", highlighting Chesnutt's vocal delivery on the title track in particular. =Outlaw= In 2010, Chesnutt announced the release of his next studio album, Outlaw. The album includes covers of songs by outlaw country artists, including Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Hank Williams Jr., Kris Kristofferson, Billy Joe Shaver, David Allan Coe, and Jerry Jeff Walker. According to Chesnutt, he was presented the idea by record producer Pete Anderson, best known for his work with Dwight Yoakam, when Saguaro Road Records was seeking an artist to perform a covers album. The two recorded the album at Anderson's studio in Burbank, California, in only two days. To support the album, he toured with Tracy Lawrence and Richie McDonald (of Lonestar) on the Country Rat Pack Tour. Thom Jurek referred to the album as \\"a no-frills, solid, lean, mean, rocking, emotionally sincere tribute to the outlaw generation, which is, in many ways, an extension of Chesnutt's own persona.\\" =Live From The Big D, Greatest Hits II, and Tradition Lives= Chesnutt formed his own label, Nada Dinero, in 2012. His first release through this label was a live album called Live from the Big D, recorded in Dallas, Texas. This was followed by a second Greatest Hits package in 2015. The album accounted for one single, \\"When the Lights Go Out (Tracie's Song)\\". Chesnutt continued to tour throughout the 2010s. In 2013, George Jones invited Chesnutt to be his opener on the last show of his farewell tour at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. However, Jones died before the show could take place, so Chesnutt and other artists held a tribute show in Jones's honor instead. His next studio album, Tradition Lives, came out in 2016. Included on the album was a cover of Merle Haggard's \\"There Won't Be Another Now\\", from his 1985 album Kern River. According to Chesnutt, the cover was something that Ritchey and Chesnutt had done for fun, without the intention of ever putting it on an album, due to it being one of Chesnutt's favorite Merle Haggard songs. As Haggard died just before the album's release, they chose to include it as a tribute to him. Of the album's sound, Chesnutt remarked that \\"I wanted to show the world that I‚Äôm still here and that I‚Äôm still Country. I‚Äôm not changing with the times.\\" Erlewine noted the \\"simple, spare, and easy\\" production of the album, and thought that it was similar in sound to Chesnutt's earlier albums. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Mark Chesnutt among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Additional contributions In 1994, he contributed three cover songs to multi-artist compilation albums. These were Merle Haggard's \\"Goodbye Comes Hard for Me\\", recorded for the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country; Keith Whitley's \\"I Never Go Around Mirrors (I've Got a Heartache to Hide)\\" to Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album; and \\"Good Ones and Bad Ones\\", a duet with George Jones on the latter's 1994 duets album The Bradley Barn Sessions. In 1996, the radio station WKIS in Boca Raton, Florida, compiled a Christmas album titled A Country Christmas from WKIS 99.9, to which Chesnutt contributed a recording of the Christmas carol \\"What Child Is This?\\" His version made the Hot Country Songs charts that same year due to seasonal airplay. Musical style and influences Chesnutt's musical style draws mainly from honky-tonk and neotraditional country. Due to both singers hailing from Beaumont, Chesnutt was frequently compared stylistically to George Jones. Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune wrote that he was \\"a throwback to the inwardly-tough, just-do-it kind of country star they were making back when they minted George Jones, who preceded Chesnutt out of the rough-and-tumble East Texas honky- tonks 40 years ago.\\" Nash described Chesnutt's vocal style by saying that he \\"has a comely, smooth baritone and a supple way of moving through his vocal range\\", and a \\"friendly foghorn\\" with \\"earnestness\\". Rick Mitchell, writing in The Encyclopedia of Country Music, described Chesnutt as \\"arguably the strongest pure-country voice to come out of Southeastern Texas since George Jones\\", and an uncredited review in People said that Chesnutt \\"has a natural, George Jonesian sob and enough machismo to get away with going falsetto when he wants.\\" Chesnutt has cited Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, and Elvis Presley as major influences of his. Mitchell also noted that Chesnutt was able to have success with both ballads and uptempo material such as \\"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\\" and \\"Old Flames Have New Names\\", as well as the strong presence of cover songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Some of his songs, such as \\"It Sure Is Monday\\" and \\"Gonna Get a Life\\", have featured influences of Cajun music through prominent use of fiddle and accordion. Chesnutt's musical persona placed a greater emphasis on song quality over physical attractiveness, compared to the move toward young and attractive males that prevailed in country music in the 1990s. Nash stated that he \\"distanced himself from the pack with an identifiable baritone and a focus on music over image\\", and Barry Gilbert of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch similarly stated that he \\"put the music and his warm, classic-country voice before the image.\\" Chesnutt stated in a 1996 interview that \\"I would rather play honky-tonks the rest of my life for $500 a week than be something I'm not.\\" He noted that during his latter years at Decca and MCA, he was constantly pressured by label heads to record more mainstream-friendly country pop instead of the traditional sounds of his earlier albums, due to the genre's shift away from neotraditional country having a negative impact on his album sales. He also said that some of the tracks on Savin' the Honky Tonk were songs that the major labels had rejected, and that he would \\"rather sell 100,000 albums [of traditional country] than 6 million of some crap that I wasn't happy with.\\" Personal life Chesnutt has been married to the former Tracie Motley since 1992. The two met in a bar, and according to Chesnutt, \\"She came out there with a guy she was with at the time, and I took her away from him\\". The couple have three sons: Waylon, Casey, and Cameron. Waylon was named after Waylon Jennings, who jokingly suggested during the recording sessions for their cover of \\"Rainy Day Woman\\" that the then-pregnant Tracie name their child after him. Although Jennings later stated that the suggestion was a joke, Chesnutt decided to choose the name anyway. In late 1995, following Waylon Chesnutt's birth, Tracie typically stayed home at the couple's house in Jasper, Texas, while also working as an artist. The birth of his sons also caused Chesnutt to tour less frequently by the end of the 1990s, as he wanted to be able to spend more time with his family.

This episode is also known as \\"The Goodies Find Their Roots\\" and \\"Hoots, Toots and Froots\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Prologue During the episode, the Goodies also appear as their ancestors: * Tim Brooke-Taylor also appears as 'Kounty Kutie' * Graeme Garden also appears as 'Keltic Kilty' * Bill Oddie also appears as 'Kinda Kinky' Plot The Goodies tell of the time when their ancestors were young men, and how their ancestors met for the first time. Graeme's family were Highlanders who lived in bleak conditions in Scotland, where initiation of the young men of the village included being dunked in porridge and catching a wild haggis. Bill's Northern England family sold fruit. Tim, whose ancestors were also English, concludes that they were noble, because the family had its own Coat- of-Arms; Bill reinterprets the Coat of Arms and shows Tim that his ancestors were in fact sheep stealers. None of the Goodies ancestors knew each other at this time. Then, a bus went around the United Kingdom, taking up all of the young men of the villages -- first of all Graeme's ancestor 'Keltic Kilty' was rounded up, with all of the other young men from his village -- then Bill's ancestor 'Kinda Kinky' was rounded up, with all of the other young men from his village -- and, finally, Tim's ancestor 'Kounty Kutie' was rounded up, with all the other young men in the same sheep 'trade'. All of the young men who had been captured were then put up for auction as entertainers, and eventually everyone had been bought -- apart from 'Kounty Kutie', 'Keltic Kilty' and 'Kinda Kinky', who were forced to work together as entertainers, including on \\"The Black and White Minstrel Show\\". They rebel against being Minstrels, leading to hijinks as they are chased around the BBC. The network is so impressed they give the trio their own series.

Other variations include Nnama-Orjiakor. They are part of the Umu-eleh/ Umu ele clan (umunna) in Umuenechi, Umuanum, Nibo. This clan is part of the greater Umu-Nzekwe clan. Colonial administration Nnama Orjiakor (Ojiako) was the ruler of Nibo for many years before being appointed a Warrant Chief and Paramount Ruler in 1896 by Queen Victoria of England during the colonial administration of Nigeria by Lord Lugard. Amongst notable Royal personalities also honored by Queen Victoria were Onyeama of EKE, Obi of Onitsha, Idigo of Aguleri, Eze of Ukpo, Agwuna of Enugu Ukwu, Onwurah of Awka, Kodilinye of Obosi, Nwodo of Ukehe and Ojiako Ezenne of Adazi-Nnukwu. Nnama was appointed the Chief Judge of the Customary Court of Appeal for Awka province in 1896 and served in that jurisdiction till his death in 1945. He was also elevated as a Judge in the Provincial Customary Court of Appeal for the Old Onitsha Province in 1898. The colonial province of Onitsha covered the geographical area known today as Anambra and Enugu States of Nigeria. Royal families The British did not impose new Igbo royal families but recognized the ancient royal families who signed the \\"Instrument of Surrender\\" as the Royal Niger Company and the Queen's Battalions conquered towns and villages in Eastern and Southern Nigeria. Prior to the British conquest of Nibo, Nnama was the Deputy Chief Judge of the legendary \\"Omenuko\\" Court headed by Okoli Ijeoma (Ijoma/Ijomah) of Ndikelionwu (Ndike), a warlord ruling over all the towns in what is now known as Anambra State from 1856 until the British conquest of the heartland in 1896. Nnama sealed a lifelong blood treaty with this warlord in 1876 through the marriage of his sister to Okoli's 2nd son, Crown Prince Nwene Ijeoma (Ijoma/Ijomah). Surrender to the British Nibo was the first town to capitulate to the British Army. Nnama sent an emissary to Okoli briefing him of the mighty military strength and arsenal of the British Battalion and informing him that the Nibo War council had decided not to wage a futile war but to surrender. Okoli sent a \\"flag-staff\\" message to Nnama and, after wishing him farewell, vowed that he would never be ruled by any other king: white, red or black. He kept preparing for war. After the \\"bloody massacre\\" of Agulu town warriors, Okoli continued to fight the British until his army was badly broken. He dressed up in his royal robe, sat on his royal throne and put himself down after drinking from the royal cup. When the British army arrived at Ndike, Okoli was gone at his word. The British came to Nibo in 1896, officially conquered Nibo in 1904, and brought Christianity to Nibo in 1908. In 1904, Ezi Nkwo, in Umuanum Nibo, Nnama signed the official peace treaty. Northcote Thomas, The British Colonial Anthropologist and the Re- Entanglements Project Photographs of Nnama, his kinsmen and Nibo from 1911 have surfaced. The photographs were taken by the British colonial anthropologist Northcote Thomas during the second tour of his anthropological survey of Igbo-speaking peoples of Southern Nigeria (1910‚Äì11). The remarkable archives of these anthropological surveys are the subject of a three-year project that Prof Paul Basu of SOAS, University of London, is running ‚Äì see [Re:Entanglements]. The negatives of the photographs are held by the Royal Anthropological Institute and prints are indeed in the collections of the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The Nnama family today THe Nnama family today make up a large clan scattered around the USA, all over Europe, and Africa, including Nigeria. The ancestral home remains at Eze Nnama-Orjiakor Court in Umuenechi, Umuanum Nibo, Awka South LGA, Nigeria. They are all very highly accomplished in many different fields. The Late Prof Samuel Nnama became the Traditional Prime Minister of Nibo from Dec 2014 until his death in Feb 2016. He authored a book centered around his childhood experiences growing up in Nibo.

Much of Karges' life was spent in and around Berlin, where he was born, worked, and died. Karges came into contact with Sweelinck's student, Andreas D√ºben, through his travels in North Germany and the Low Countries, and became his assistant at the German Church in Stockholm. In January 1646 he was appointed chamber musician and composer at the court of the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg in Berlin, and subsequently became organist at the cathedral there. His eyesight gradually deteriorated, and by the 1680s he had several assistants and had been relieved of many of his responsibilities. Still, his organ playing was apparently still of such high quality that in 1683 his salary was nearly doubled. Six of Karges' pieces are known to have survived, all for organ.

It was discovered by American astronomer Brian Skiff at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station on 31 August 1984. It was named after ex-Beatle Sir Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr).  Orbit and classification  Starr is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,219 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was made at the U.S. Goethe Link Observatory in 1957, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 27 years prior to its discovery.  Physical characteristics  Starr has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid by PanSTARRS photometric survey. = Rotation period = According to the space- based survey by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Starr measures 6.6 and 6.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.258 and 0.277, respectively, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the family's largest member and namesake ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 7.5 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.8. = Diameter and albedo = Several rotational lightcurves of Starr were obtained from photometric observations. An unpublished lightcurve by Kryszczynska from November 2011, has been rated best by CALL. It gave a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.20 in magnitude ().  Naming  This minor planet was named in after Richard Starkey (born 1940), better known as Ringo Starr, the drummer of The Beatles. He joined the English rock band in 1962, replacing its former drummer Pete Best. Ringo has released various albums in his solo career and also acted in several movies. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 10 April 1990 (). The minor planets 8749 Beatles, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney and 4149 Harrison were named after the band and its three other members.

The regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions are light infantry units assigned to the 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams respectively of the 10th Mountain Division located at Fort Drum, New York. The 3d Battalion was active in the U.S. Army Reserve in Colorado. The 4th Battalion was a Regular Army unit assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division (Light) at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. History =World War II= The 87th Mountain Infantry Battalion was activated on 15 November 1941 at Fort Lewis, Washington, with Lieutenant Colonel Onslow S. Rolfe as the commanding officer. This unit was the first American regiment of mountain troops. It was expanded into a regiment in 1943. On 12 May 1942, the regiment was reorganized as the 87th Mountain Infantry at Fort Lewis. The 87th joined the 10th Mountain Division at Camp Hale, Colorado and trained there during 1942‚Äì43. On 29 July 1943, the regiment sailed to the Aleutian Islands as part of Amphibious Task Force 9. Also included in Task Force Force 9 were the First Special Service Force and the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade.

In addition to the 96th shoulder sleeve insignia, members of the unit wore color 10th Division shoulder sleeve insignia on the left front pocket of fatigue shirts to signify the battalion's historical link to the then-inactive division. Mountain tabs were not worn over the patch as they were almost impossible to find before the division was reactivated at Fort Drum and tabs went into production again. Units of the 3d Battalion, 87th Infantry were stationed at the following locations: *HHC, Building 2344, Fort Carson, CO 80913 * Co A, 2501 West Northern Avenue, Pueblo, CO 81004 (Demolished for Asbestos) * Co B, Building 731, Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Denver, CO 80240 * Co C, 482-28 Road, PO Box 1805, Grand Junction, CO 81501 ** 2d Platoon, 631 Grand Avenue, PO Box 1805, Glenwood Springs, CO 81601 ** 3d Platoon, 109 West 19th Street, PO Box 378, Durango, CO 81301 * Support Company, Building 2344, Fort Carson, CO 80913 A detachment of the battalion's Company C was located at 158 Bodo Drive, Durango, CO 81301; it was inactivated on 16 October 1984.

The Catamounts deployed from Schofield Barracks in August 1991 to the Sinai Peninsula. Task Force 4/87 performed peace keeping duties as the USBATT assigned to the Multinational Force & Observers at South Camp near Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. In February 1992, after their six-month rotation in the Sinai Desert, they redeployed back to Schofield Barracks. The Catamounts deployed again for their second real-world mission in 13 months. In the aftermath of Hurricane Iniki, a Category 4 storm which made landfall on 11 September 1992, the battalion was sent to Kauai and it effectively provided hurricane relief for immediate needs of the local population. Assistance had arrived before any requests had been made by the local officials for aid. For the next month, following Iniki's decimation of Kauai, the soldiers helped in various capacities and distributed water and MRE's. The battalion redeployed back to Oahu at the mission's end in October 1992. The 4th battalion was deactivated at Schofield Barracks and relieved from the 25th Infantry Division effective 15 July 1995. =Panama= The lineage of World War II's Company E, 87th Infantry Regiment was redesignated effective 1 May 1987 as HHC, 5th Battalion, 87th Infantry, assigned to the 193d Infantry Brigade in Panama and activated.

Each of these objectives lay astride the key lines of communication into the center of Panama city. In the days following the initial assault, TF 5-87 conducted stability operations and was involved in the security of the Santa Felipe, Santa Anna, El Marana, and Chorillo sections of the city. During the remainder of the operation, TF Wildcat secured key sites in Panama City and reacted to security and civil military tasking. =Operation Restore Hope= 12 December 1992, 2-87th Infantry, with Co A, 1-87th infantry, deployed to Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope as the first Army units on the ground. Co A, 1-87 was attached to 2-87 Infantry to comprise TF 2-87. TF 2-87 conducted numerous missions, including several air assault operations (such as an airfield seizure in Beledweyne, Somalia), cordon and search operations, ambushes, search and destroy missions and quick reaction force missions. Members of TF 2-87 were first awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge for actions in the Mogadishu suburb of Afgooye in January 1993. Both 2-87th and 1-87th engaged in numerous running battles with Somali guerrilla fighters all over southern Somalia. In February and March 1993, both 2-87th Inf. and 1-87 Inf. went to the aid of 3-14 Inf. and Belgian forces in the southern port city of Kismayo, after fighting erupted between rival factions. Although 1-87th Infantry never deployed to Somalia as a unit, its companies deployed as attachments to other units and participated in numerous missions, including C Co 1-87 (while attached to 2-14th Inf) and the Battle of Mogadishu. 1-87th Infantry with President George Bush =Operation Uphold Democracy= In September 1994, the 1st Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division, which included 1-87 Infantry, conducted the Army's first Air Assault operation from the deck of a naval vessel, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69), in support of Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. This was the Army's first air operation from a naval vessel since the Doolittle Raid of World War II. =Twenty-first century= In the mid-1990s elements of the 87th Infantry trained in Pakistan, Panama, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. In 1999 Co B, 1-87 was deployed to Bosnia- Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Forge. Co C, 1-87 completed a similar deployment from October 1998 to March 1999. Other combat and peace keeping deployments of the 1st and 2d Battalions of the 87th Infantry included Iraq (1991, present), Somalia (1992‚Äì93), Haiti (1994-95), Bosnia and Afghanistan (particularly Operation Anaconda, where 1-87 was the first unit on the ground during the initial invasion of Afghanistan). A detachment (3d Platoon) from Co C, 1-87 was attached to the 2d Battalion, 14th Infantry and served as the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) during the Battle of Mogadishu. The unit never deployed to Somalia as a whole, but all of 1st Battalion was attached to other units while deployed to Somalia, including 2-87 IN, and the 2d Battalion, 14th Infantry. The 1st Battalion deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from July 2003 to May 2004. Although originally slotted as a six-month deployment the unit was extended to ten months due to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. From 2005 to 2006 1-87 IN deployed to Baghdad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III-IV. 1-87 deployed in 2007‚Äì2008 to the northern Kirkuk area of Iraq, near the small city of Hawijah. The unit was part of the \\"Surge\\" and remained in Kirkuk for 15 months in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom VI. 1-87 IN deployed to Northern Afghanistan in early 2010. The unit's mission was to support Operation Enduring Freedom by partnering with ISAF forces to help establish Afghan government influence in the region. The battalion was tasked with clearing and securing several districts including Aliabad, Char-a-dara, and the City of Kunduz aiding the Afghan security forces in doing so. 1-87 was sent to clear the valley of Gortepa. The battalion successfully cleared villages of Taliban presence then established Afghan local police outposts in the newly acquired areas. This task took several weeks, starting with securing the district of Aliabad to the south to impede the Talibans ability to reinforce and resupply the Gortepa valley. By the end of March 2011, 1-87 had returned to Fort Drum. The New York Times followed 1-87 throughout the deployment in order to produce an online feature titled \\"A Year at War.\\" 1-87 IN deployed in 2015-2016 with 1st Brigade Combat Team to Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Charlie company 1-87 IN deployed to Cameroon in August 2017 while the rest of the battalion deployed to Afghanistan in late September of the same year.

Coat of arms *Blazon ** Shield: Azure, on a mountain issuant from base Argent, an ice axe, and ski pole in saltirewise, points to base Proper, a horseshoe, points to base Gules. **Crest: On a wreath Argent and Azure rising from a castle tower of three battlements Gules masoned Or charged with a fountain, a demi-catamountain proper supporting a lance of the fourth with a split pennon parted fesswise of Vert, of the first and of the third. **Motto VIRES MONTESQUE VINCIMUS (We Conquer Powers and Mountains). * Symbolism ** Shield: The shield bears a snow-capped mountain to represent both the region where the organization first received its specialized training and the normal home of mountain troops. The crossed ski pole and ice axe are symbolic of the tools used by mountain troops, while the horseshoe indicates the pack element of the organization. The fact that the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment was the first organization of its kind is indicated by the single red horseshoe. **Crest: The red castle tower is reminiscent of the battle of Castel d'Aiano in Northern Italy, a bloody struggle against prepared positions, rough terrain, heavily mined areas, and enemy artillery fire; its three battlements stand for campaigns in the Aleutians, Northern Apennines, and Po Valley. The fountain (wavy white and blue-striped disc) represents the first crossing of the Po River which brought the 87th to the foothills of the Alps. The catamountain or wildcat personifies the fighting spirit, cunning, and aggressiveness of the Mountain Infantry, and the lance and pennant allude to the arms of the Province of Bologna where the unit emerged after fighting their way out of the Apennine Mountains. * Background The coat of arms was originally approved for the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment on 21 October 1942. It was redesignated for the 87th Infantry Regiment on 13 December 1948. On 21 May 1956 the symbolism was amended to correct the translation of the motto. On 7 December 1964 the coat of arms was amended to change the wording in the blazonry of the shield and to add the crest. The insignia was amended to correct the translation of the motto and update the description on 26 February 2016.

The episode originally broadcast on Fox on March 4, 2007. The plot follows the Griffin family's neighbor Quagmire being dismissed from his job as a pilot after Peter sabotages his airplane by emptying the fuel tank, causing it to crash. Peter, Joe and Cleveland make a plan to get Quagmire his job back and, although the plan itself fails, Quagmire is re-hired. Written by Tom Devanney and directed by John Holmquist, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 8.59 million households in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Barclay DeVeau, Hugh Hefner, Phil LaMarr, Rachael MacFarlane and Fred Tatasciore, along with several recurring guest voice actors from the series. Plot After seeing a redneck comedy show, Peter purchases a pickup truck and decides to become a redneck himself. He does such \\"typical\\" redneck things as bringing the couch out onto the lawn, propositioning Meg, and chewing tobacco. Peter puts a large patriotic and anti-abortion sticker on the back window of his pickup, which obscures his view and causes him to reverse into Quagmire's car, destroying it. As a result, Peter has to drive Quagmire to the airport, where he is due to fly an airplane from Quahog to Atlanta. While at the airport, Peter steals the fuel used for Quagmire's airplane, believing it will make his pickup fly. As a result, Quagmire's plane runs out of fuel part way into the flight and crashes. Quagmire loses his job and after draining his life savings within a few weeks is forced to live with the Griffins until he can find another job. Annoyed by Quagmire's behavior in the house, Peter's wife Lois tells him to help Quagmire get a job. Unfortunately Quagmire keeps messing up every job they find, complaining the only thing he can do well is fly a plane. Peter, Quagmire, Joe and Cleveland make up a plan to get Quagmire to get his job back: whilst Quagmire is a passenger on a flight, the others will impersonate cabin crew to get onto the flight, then drug the pilots so Quagmire will have to step in and safely land the plane. Shortly after take off, Peter, Joe and Cleveland drug the pilots and then calls for help, only for them to find Quagmire is not on board because while in the airport, Quagmire got distracted by having sex with the woman at the check-in desk, causing him to miss the flight. As none of them can fly the plane, it goes into freefall. Quagmire is deeply disappointed with himself, and goes to the bar, where Playboy founder Hugh Hefner meets him. Hefner tells Quagmire that the late pornographic actor John Holmes believed that Quagmire was the greatest pilot of all time. Feeling reinvigorated, he goes off to the air traffic control tower and, via radio, gives Peter detailed instructions on how to land the plane safely, which are successful although Peter is briefly imprisoned afterwards for hijacking the flight and raped while in prison. As a reward for his work, Quagmire's job is reinstated. Production Hugh Hefner guest starred in the episode. Hugh Hefner provided his own voice for the episode. In the DVD commentary, show producer David Goodman comments that, throughout the episode, little respect is shown for rednecks. The Thai women escaping from Quagmire's car after Peter crashes into it were all voiced by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, a Family Guy writer and producer. In the episode Quagmire (voiced by MacFarlane) utters several phrases in Thai which MacFarlane claims were taught to him by Chevapravatdumrong and that (as of the recording of the commentary) he doesn't know the English translation of those phrases. Mayor West is shown reading a book to children at a school, and being told about the plane crash; this is a reference to the reaction of George W. Bush after being informed about the September 11, 2001 attacks. The sketch showing news anchorman Tom Tucker showing several scenarios of how the crash could have turned out is a reference, Seth MacFarlane states, \\"to how irresponsible it is\\". The scenario of the airplane crash survivor slapping his wife eight times was toned down to four on the FOX airing and the syndicated version. There is also a crotch shot of Peter getting out of Paris Hilton's car, which was censored with pixellation on TV, but shown uncensored on DVD. The name that the person specified on the telephone when ringing the Griffins' house to contact Quagmire (\\"Long Rod von HugenDong\\") was changed, as broadcasting standards personnel objected to the original name (which was \\"Long Rod von HugenSchlong\\"). The \\"Prom Night Dumpster Baby\\" gag was pitched by Danny Smith. Walter Murphy organized a 40-piece orchestra to perform the musical for the episode. The scene of Quagmire working as Joe's diaper changer (with Joe so humiliated over it that he asks Quagmire to help him commit suicide) was edited on FOX (but not Cartoon Network), as FOX objected to the feces joke and the suicide reference. The \\"Who Else But Quagmire\\" cutaway which implied that Quagmire had sex with a dead woman met with objection from FOX censors who were more concerned that the violated dead woman was implied to be a virgin. After engaging in sex with an airport worker, Quagmire states \\"the contents of your vagina may have shifted during coitus.\\" On FOX, \\"vagina\\" was changed to \\"panties.\\" The conversation between Hugh Hefner and Quagmire in the airport has a slight echo, due to recording in Hefner's den, rather than the production studios. As a result, an echo of similar level was added to Quagmire's voice in order to equal both voices out. In addition to the regular cast and Hefner, voice actor Barclay DeVeau, voice actor Phil LaMarr, voice actress Rachael MacFarlane and voice actor Fred Tatasciore guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, actor Ralph Garman, writer Mark Hentemann, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Cultural references The start of the show introduces many references to famous redneck comedians such as Larry the Cable Guy. Peter imagining flying his pickup truck through the air and greeting fighter jet pilots is a reference to Top Gun. After Quagmire crashes the plane, his co-pilot is shown to be Nien Nunb, a reference to 1983 science- fiction film Return of the Jedi. The mice that say \\"three weeks later\\" is a reference to 1995 film Babe. The faux introduction after Peter and Lois' conversation about Quagmire is a reference to Will & Grace. The scene of the airplane taking off as Peter and his friends prepare to drug the pilots is a reference to Airplane!, as is Hugh Hefner's peptalk to Quagmire and the playing of the Notre Dame Victory March. Other music from Airplane! is used as Quagmire is assisting Peter in landing the airplane safely. The scene in which Mayor Adam West is reading a story book to kids is a reference to George W. Bush, who was reading to kids at a school in Florida when he learned of the September 11 attacks. The style of the end credits in the episode is almost exactly similar to the ones used on the television series Little House on the Prairie. Reception In a very slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 8.59 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.0 rating in the 18-49 demographic, being slightly edged out by The Simpsons, while still winning over American Dad!. In a review of Family Guy, Volume five, Nancy Basile regarded \\"Airport '07,\\" alongside \\"Prick Up Your Ears,\\" and \\"Barely Legal\\" as \\"gem episodes.\\" Ahsan Haque of IGN commented \\"When Family Guy is at its best, audiences are typically presented with an overwhelming barrage of cultural references, some disturbing imagery, and usually left with a sufficiently catchy musical number ‚Äî all put together to tell a somewhat cohesive story. In this respect, 'Airport '07' succeeds admirably by excelling at all of the above,\\" adding that \\"the disturbing elements in this episode seem to be there purely for shock value.\\" Brett Love of TV Squad reviewed the episode positively, writing \\"Peter finding the identity he'd been searching for his whole life, that of a redneck, was a long way to go to get to him being the cause of Quagmire getting fired, but it was worth the trip,\\" adding \\"there were a lot of fun bits in the redneck segment.\\" Love concluded to write \\"Overall, a really good episode.\\" References External links * * Category:Family Guy (season 5) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about termination of employment Category:Aviation in fiction Category:Cultural depictions of Hugh Hefner ","title":"Airport '07"},{"id":"7996491","text":"\\"Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air\\" is the third episode of the sixth season of the American animated television series Family Guy, an episode produced for season 5. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 7, 2007. Joe Swanson (Patrick Warburton) gets the impression that his wife Bonnie (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) is tired of being married to a handicapped person, so he decides to get a leg transplant. Excited about his new ability to walk, Joe dives head first into extreme sports and begins to hang around more active friends. Meanwhile, Peter (Seth MacFarlane) and the guys are upset at how Joe is acting and decide to teach him a lesson. In doing so, he is re-crippled, and he makes amends with his friends. The episode was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Julius Wu. It received praise from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.4 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jeff Bergman, Jamie Farr, Phil LaMarr, Wendy Raquel Robinson and Nicole Sullivan, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. This is the first episode where Meg was not seen or mentioned. Plot Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire are at the Drunken Clam, when Lois, Bernice (Cleveland's first girlfriend since his divorce with Loretta) and Bonnie show up at the bar, Peter and his friends get annoyed. Therefore, Peter suggests that they should build their own bar called \\"The Quahog Men's Club\\", which is designated for men only. It takes six weeks and $8,000 for them to build it. After building it, Lois wants Peter to get rid of it. Many people start to show up at the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels self-conscious about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that he will be able to walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. However, Joe soon feels that the other three are holding him back, and leaves them for three new friends (named Parker, Quentin and Portland). Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re- crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him. Production Actor Jamie Farr guest starred in the episode. \\"Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air\\" was written by Andrew Goldberg. This episode was his first time working for the show, and was a result of Goldberg being creator Seth MacFarlane's assistant. He wrote the episode, and executive producer David A. Goodman thought he did a \\"fantastic job\\". He would later go on to write the season seven episode \\"The Juice is Loose\\". The episode was directed by former Mission Hill and The Oblongs director and series veteran Julius Wu, who had been a member of the show's staff since the fifth season episode, \\"The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\". Directors Peter Shin and James Purdum acted as supervising directors. In addition to the regular cast, actor Jeff Bergman, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actor Jamie Farr, actress Wendy Raquel Robinson, and voice actress Nicole Sullivan guest starred in the episode as Fred Flintstone, Portland, Himself, Bernice, and Muriel Goldman respectively. Recurring guest voice actors Steve Callaghan, actor Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Recurring guest cast members Adam West, Jennifer Tilly, and Patrick Warburton also made appearances. Cultural references Adolf Hitler was referenced in this episode. The episode makes several references to pop culture referencing films, music and media. Peter remembers a movie he watched with actor Jack Black in it, a (fictional) film called The Unconventional Butler. When rock climbing Cleveland is saved from a fall by Spider-Man. Joe makes Cleveland, Quagmire and Peter sing and dance \\"Good Morning\\" from the film Singin' in the Rain. The title is based on the theme song to The Greatest American Hero titled \\"Theme from The Greatest American Hero (Believe It or Not)\\" sung by Joey Scarbury. The episode makes references to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state that they would like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters. The episode also makes references to history. In the following cutaway Adolf Hitler is shown juggling three fish while riding a unicycle. After a while the same cutaway reappears, but this time Peter shows up and knocks Hitler off the unicycle and punches him in the face and breaks the fourth wall by saying \\"See. We had a plan for that all along\\". It also makes references to Christianity. When Lois suggests that Peter finds a new friend, she tells him to find a kindred spirit like Judas found in Pontius Pilate. Reception This episode drew 8.4 million viewers on its original broadcast. Also, a repeat of the episode on the Fox network December 16, 2007 was number 29 of 94 programs listed by Nielsen Media Research, the audience measurement systems developed to determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, for the week of December 10 to December 16, 2007. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode a positive review, writing that it \\"brings back memories how groundbreaking and fantastic this show once was, and how great the show can be when the writers put their minds to it\\". He graded \\"Believe it Or Not, Joe's Walking On Air\\" 9.3 out of 10. Brad Trechak of TV Squad also praised the episode, stating \\"Family Guy is starting to stick to what it does best\\", though he called the ending \\"somewhat predictable\\". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club wrote that the episode had \\"a fairly interesting storyline\\", but she was distracted by the absence of Joe's son, Kevin. She graded \\"Believe it Or Not, Joe's Walking On Air\\" B. In contrast, Robert Pierson from the TV Critic gave the episode a negative review criticizing the episode's self-referential humor and the fact that the characters would be so selfish that they would cripple their own friend, he stated that the scene where Peter and the others attack Joe made him \\"dislike the show because there is nothing funny, positive or entertaining about it\\", he ended his review by saying that the episode's humor is \\"evidence of a writing team which is too lazy and incompetent to write good humour\\".

The first written record of Hasse dates from his appointment as organist at the Marienkirche in L√ºbeck, a post later held by Buxtehude. Although virtually nothing is known of Hasse's early life, he is believed to have been a student of Sweelinck between 1606 and 1609. Hasse remained in L√ºbeck until his death in 1640, and achieved considerable fame at the time as a teacher and performer. His son, Nikolaus Hasse, was among his pupils, and became a musician in his own right. Hasse's own surviving output is small, consisting of just three organ works and two choral works. After his death in 1640, Hasse's position as the main organist at the Marienkirche was taken by Franz Tunder. Nikolaus Hasse Nikolaus Hasse was born in Lubeck c. 1617. He was appointed organist of the Marienkirche, Rostock and held this post until 1671. He published Delitiae Musicae in 1642 which contains all his chamber music (21 suites).

The current principal is Liz Foster and there are currently around 1,400 students who are enrolled in the school.  History  MacGregor State High School was officially opened on 5 July 1969 by the Honourable Mr S.D. Tooth M.L.A, Minister for Health with nine teachers and 203 students. The school originally consisted of 2 classroom blocks which incorporated learning spaces, the library, Tuckshop, office accommodation and facilities for staff and students. The initial building program saw provisions made for and oval and both tennis and basketball courts on the 25.5 perch allocation of land. MacGregor has a proud Scottish heritage. Mrs Jean Mcgreger-Lowndes was the school's first patron, and many of the school's icons and emblems reflect this heritage, including the Clans (roll classes/house groups) - Alpin, Duncun, Gregor and Rob Roy; the tartan of the uniforms and the first school motto 'S Rioghal Mo Dhream' (Royal is My Race). On Black Sunday, 4 November 1973 at 6:30 PM a tornado struck the school, causing hundred of thousands of dollars of damage with much of the school having to be rebuilt. On such dark occasions, Mrs McGregor-Lowndes would quote from Sir Walter Scott's, \\"MacGregors' Gathering\\": > \\"While there's leaving in the forest, and foam on the river, > MacGregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever!\\"  Sport  As with most Australian schools, MacGregor State High utilises a house system, of which is referred to as a 'clan system'. There are currently four clans - Alpin (Blue), Duncan (Yellow), Gregor (Green) and Rob Roy (Red).  Awards  In recent years, the school has won awards in a variety of fields. There were the Education Minister's Awards for Excellence in Art (2004, 2006), the BHP Billiton Science Award (Physics, Engineering & Technology) (2001) and the Queensland Youth Music Awards (2006).

During the Second Macedonian War (200‚Äì196 BC), Macedon had given Sparta control over Argos, an important city on the Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos at the end of war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection. As a result of the war, Sparta lost its position as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover the losses failed and Nabis, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was forcibly made a member of its former rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries of fierce political independence. Background After the death of the Spartan regent Machanidas in 207 BC in battle against the Achaean League, Nabis overthrew the reigning king Pelops with the backing of a mercenary army and placed himself on the throne, claiming descent from the Eurypontid king Demaratus. By then, the traditional constitution of Lycurgus had already lost its meaning and Sparta was dominated by a group of its former mercenaries. Polybius described Nabis' force as \\"a crowd of murderers, burglars, cutpurses and highwaymen\\".Polybius 13.6 In 205 BC, Nabis signed a peace treaty with Rome, but in 201 BC he attacked the territory of Messene, at that time an ally of both parties, which Sparta had ruled until the mid 4th century BC. The Spartans captured Messene but were soon forced to abandon it when the army of Megalopolis arrived under the command of Philopoemen. Later, they were decisively defeated at Tegea and Nabis was forced to check his expansionist ambitions for the time.Polybius 16.13 Greece and the Aegean on the eve of the Second Macedonian War During the Second Macedonian War, Nabis had another possibility for expansion. Philip of Macedon offered him the polis of Argos in exchange for Sparta defecting from the Roman coalition and joining the Macedonian alliance.Livy 32.39 Nabis accepted and received control over Argos. When the war turned against Macedon, however, he rejoined the Roman coalition and sent 600 Cretan mercenaries to support the Roman army.Livy 32.40 Philip was later decisively defeated by the Romans at the battle of Cynoscephalae,Livy 33.10 but Sparta remained in control of Argos. After the war, the Roman army did not withdraw from Greece, but instead sent garrisons to various strategic locations across Greece to secure its interests.Livy 33.31 Nabis' reforms In return for his assistance in the war, Rome accepted Nabis' possession of the polis of Argos. While Nabis was already King of Sparta, he made his wife Apia ruler of her hometown Argos. Afterwards, Apia and Nabis staged a financial coup by confiscating large amounts of property from the wealthy families of these cities, and torturing those who resisted them; much of the confiscated land was redistributed to liberated helots loyal to Nabis.Cartledge and Spawforth, Hellenistic and Roman Sparta:A tale of two Cities, 74 After increasing his territory and wealth by the aforementioned method, Nabis started to turn the port of Gythium into a major naval arsenal and fortified the city of Sparta. His Cretan allies were already allowed to have naval bases on Spartan territory, and from these they ventured on acts of piracy. His naval buildup offered a chance even for the very poor to participate, as rowers, in the profitable employment. However, the extension of the naval capacities at Gythium greatly displeased the abutting states of the Aegean Sea and the Roman Republic. Nabis' rule was largely based on his social reforms and the rebuilding of Sparta's armed forces. The military of Lacedaemonia, Sparta, had traditionally been based on levies of full citizens and perioeci (one of the free non-citizen groups of Lacedaemonia) supported by lightly armed helots. From several thousands in the times of the Greco-Persian Wars, the numbers of full citizen Spartans had declined to a few hundred in the times of Cleomenes III. There were possibly several reasons for the decline of numbers, one of which was that every Spartan who wasn't able to pay his share in the syssitia (common meal for men in Doric societies) lost his full citizenship, although this didn't exclude his offspring from partaking in the agoge (traditional Spartan education and training regime). As a result, the fielding of a respectable hoplite army without mercenaries or freed helots was difficult. Cleomenes increased the number of full citizens again and made the Spartan army operate with an increased reliance on more lightly armored phalangites of the Macedonian style.Warfare in the Classical World, p. 73 (Macedonian infantry) on the equipment of the Macedonian phalangites However, many of these restored citizens were killed in the Battle of Sellasia and Nabis' politics drove the remainder of them into exile. In consequence, the heavy troops were no longer available in sufficient numbers. This led to a serious decline in Sparta's military power, and the aim of Nabis reforms was to reestablish a class of loyal subjects capable of serving as well-equipped phalangites (operating in a close and deep formation, with a longer spear than the hoplites'). Nabis' liberation of the enslaved helots was one of the most outstanding deeds in Spartan history. With this action, Nabis eliminated a central ideological pillar of the old Spartan social system and the chief reason for objection to Spartan expansion by the surrounding poleis (city- states). Guarding against helot revolt had been, until this time, the central concern of Spartan foreign policy, and the need to protect against internal revolt had limited adventurism abroad; Nabis' action abolished this concern with a single stroke. His freed helots received land from him and were wedded to wealthy wives of the exiled Spartan demos (all former full citizens) and widows of the rich elite, whose husbands had been killed at his orders.Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 302 Preparations The Achaean League was upset that one of its members had remained under Spartan occupation and persuaded the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact. The Romans agreed with the Achaeans, as they did not want a strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after the Romans left Greece. In 195 BC, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the Roman commander in Greece, called a council of the Greek states at Corinth to discuss whether or not to declare war on Nabis. Among the states whose delegates participated were the Aetolian League, Macedon, Rome, Pergamum, Rhodes, Thessaly and the Achaean League. All the states represented favored war, except for the Aetolian League and Thessaly, both of which wanted the Romans to leave Greece immediately.Cartledge and Spawforth, Hellenistic and Roman Sparta:A tale of two Cities, 75 These two states offered to deal with Nabis themselves, but they met opposition from the Achaean League, which objected to any possible growth in the Aetolian League's power.Livy 34.24 The modern historian Erich Gruen has suggested that the Romans may have used the war as an excuse to station a few legions in Greece in order to prevent the Spartans and the Aetolian League from joining the Seleucid King Antiochus III if he invaded Greece.Gruen, The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome, 450 Flamininus first sent an envoy to Sparta, demanding that Nabis either surrender Argos to the Achaean League or face war with Rome and her Greek allies. Nabis refused to comply with Flamininus' ultimatum, so 40,000 Roman soldiers and their Greek allies advanced towards the Peloponnese. Entering the Peloponnese, Flamininus joined his force with that of the Achaean commander, Aristaenos, who had 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Cleonae. Together, they advanced towards Argos.Livy 34.25 Nabis had appointed his brother-in-law, the Argive Pythagoras, as commander of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted to stir up a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, he stood in the city's agora and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them to rise in revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles and most of his followers were surrounded and killed by the Spartan garrison. A few survivors from Damocles' group escaped from the city and went to Flamininus' camp. They suggested to Flamininus that, if he moved his camp closer to the city gates, the Argives would revolt against the Spartans. The Roman commander sent his light infantry and cavalry to find a position for the new camp. Upon spotting the small group of Roman soldiers, a group of Spartan troops sallied forth from the gates and skirmished with the Romans about 300 paces from the city walls. The Romans forced the Spartans to retreat back into the city. Flamininus moved his camp to the position where the skirmish had occurred. For a day he waited for the Spartans to attack him but, when no attack came, he called a war council to discuss whether or not to press the siege. All the Greek leaders except Aristaenos thought that they should attack the city, as capturing it was their primary objective in going to war. Aristaenos, on the other hand, argued that they should instead strike directly at Sparta and Laconia. Flamininus agreed with Aristaenos and the army marched to Tegea in Arcadia. The next day, Flamininus advanced to Caryae, where he waited for allied auxiliaries to reinforce him. These forces soon arrived and joined the Romans; they consisted of a contingent of Spartan exiles led by Agesipolis, the legitimate King of Sparta, who had been overthrown by the first Tyrant of Sparta, Lycurgus, twenty years earlier, and 1,500 Macedonians with 400 Thessalian cavalry sent by Philip. News also reached the allies that several fleets had arrived off the Laconian shore: a Roman fleet under Lucius Quinctius with forty ships; a Rhodian fleet with eighteen ships, led by Sosilas, hoping that the defeat of Nabis would stop the pirates that plagued their ships; and a Pergamene fleet of forty ships under King Eumenes II of Pergamum, who hoped to gain more favor with Rome and Roman support if Antiochus invaded.Holleaux, Rome and the Mediterranean; 218‚Äì133 B.C., 190Livy 34.26 Laconian campaign Nabis drafted 10,000 citizens into his army and hired 3,000 additional mercenaries. Nabis' Cretan allies, who profited from the naval bases on his territory, dispatched 1,000 specially selected warriors to augment the 1,000 they had already sent to Sparta's aid. Nabis, fearing that the Roman approach might encourage his subjects to revolt, decided to terrorize them by ordering the execution of eighty prominent citizens. Flamininus left his base and descended upon Sellasia; while the Romans were making camp, Nabis' auxiliaries attacked them. The sudden surprise attack briefly threw the allies into a state of confusion, but the Spartans retreated back to the city when the main body of legionary cohorts arrived. As the Romans marched past Sparta on their way to Mount Menelaus, Nabis' mercenaries attacked the allies' rear. Appius Claudius, commander of the rearguard, rallied his troops and forced the mercenaries to retreat behind the city's walls, inflicting heavy casualties on them in the process. The coalition army then proceeded to Amyclae, from whence they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia.Livy 34.28 The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at Gythium. As the land forces began to invest the city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct siege engines within a few days. Though these machines had a devastating effect on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out. onager, was cheaper and simpler to construct than a ballista. The application was like that of a lithobolos (the stone throwing version of a ballista), but shots were less precise. However, stones were hurled at the battlements to destroy them and the defending force before the walls were assaulted. Eventually, Dexagoridas, one of the two garrison commanders, sent word to the Roman legate that he was willing to surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta. Siege of Sparta During the siege at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, bringing with him 3,000 men from Argos.Livy 34.29 When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered he decided to send an envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on the terms of a peace.Livy 34.30 Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners.Livy 34.33 Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.Livy 34.39 Flamininus replied to Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would conclude a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos with all his garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over the next eight years and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities.Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 415 Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege.Livy 34.37 Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city.Livy 34.38 Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered by the fact that the Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile. The Romans launched an assault on Sparta and took the walls, but their advance was initially impeded by the narrowness of the roads in the city's outskirts. However, the streets grew wider as they advanced into the city's center, and the Spartans were forced further and further back. Nabis, seeing his defenses collapsing, tried to flee, but Pythagoras rallied the soldiers and ordered them to set fire to the buildings closest to the walls. Burning debris was thrown on the coalition's soldiers entering the city, causing many casualties. Observing this, Flamininus ordered his forces to withdraw to their base. When the attack was renewed later, the Spartans managed to hold off the Roman assaults for three days before Nabis, seeing that the situation was hopeless, decided to send Pythagoras with an offer of surrender. At first, Flaminius refused to see him, but when Pythagoras came to the Roman camp a second time Flamininus accepted the surrender, with the conditions of the treaty being the same as Flamininus had previously proposed. The treaty was later ratified by the Senate. The Argives revolted when they heard that Sparta was under siege. Under the Argive Archippas, they attacked the garrison commanded by Timocrates of Pellene. Timocrates surrendered the citadel on condition that he and his men could leave unharmed. In return all the Argives serving in Nabis' army were allowed to return home.Livy 34.40 Aftermath A map including Philopoemen's attacks on Sparta. After the war Flamininus visited the Nemean Games in Argos and proclaimed the polis free.Livy 34.41 The Argives immediately decided to rejoin the Achaean League. Flamininus also separated all coastal cities of Laconia from Spartan rule and placed them under Achean protection. The remains of Sparta's fleet were put under custody of these coastal cities. Nabis also had to withdraw his garrisons from Cretan cities and revoke several social and economic reforms that had strengthened Sparta's military capabilities. The Romans did not, however, remove Nabis from the Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a landlocked and effectively powerless state, the Romans wanted an independent Sparta to act as a counterweight against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured by the fact that he had to surrender five hostages, amongst them his son, Armenas. The Romans did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.Livy 34.35 After the legions under Flamininus had returned to Italy, the Greek states were once again on their own. The dominant powers in the region at this time were the kingdom of Macedon, which had recently lost a war against Rome, the Aetolians, the strengthened Achaean League and a reduced Sparta. The Aetolians, who had opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incited Nabis to retake his former territories and position among the Greek powers. By 192, Nabis who had built a new fleet and strengthened his army, besieged Gythium. The Achaeans responded by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response the Senate sent the praetor Atilius with a navy to defeat Nabis' navy as well as an embassy headed by Flamininus. Instead of waiting for the Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy headed towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet was defeated by the recently constructed Spartan fleet, with the Achean flagship falling to pieces in the first ramming attack. On land as well the Achaeans could not defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreated to Tegea. When Philopoemen reentered Laconia for a second attempt his forces were ambushed by Nabis' but nevertheless he managed to gain a victory. The Achaeans now could ravage Laconia for thirty days unopposed while the Spartan troops remained in their fortified city. Plans for capturing Sparta itself had been laid by the time the Roman envoy Flamininus arrived and convinced the Achaean strategus Philopoemen to spare it. For the time being Nabis decided to accept the status quo in return and surrender under the same conditions as the last treaty.Cartledge and Spawforth, Hellenistic and Roman Sparta:A tale of two Cities, 76 Changes in the Greek homeland before the fall of Sparta. Since Sparta's army was now weakened, Nabis appealed to the Aetolians for help. They sent to Sparta 1,000 cavalry under the command of Alexamenus. The story goes that while Nabis was observing his army's drills, the Aetolian commander Alexamenus charged at him and killed him with his lance. Afterwards the Aetolian troops seized the palace and set about looting the city but its Sparta were able to rally and drive them from Sparta.Livy 35.35 As Sparta was in turmoil Philopoemen entered the city with the Achaean army and made Sparta a member state of the League. The polis of Sparta was allowed to keep its laws and territory, but the exiles, and their rule of the Spartan warrior demos were not restored.Cartledge and Spawforth, Hellenistic and Roman Sparta:A tale of two Cities, 77 In 189 BC, the hostages taken by Rome, excluding Nabis' son, who fell ill and died, were allowed to return to Sparta.Polybius 21.2 Still deprived of any port and suffering from political and economic problems from having the hostile exiles close by and not having access to the sea, the Spartans captured the city of Las, which was the home of many exiles and a member of the Union of free Laconians.Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 423 The Acheans officially adopted this as the reason to finish Spartan independence once and for all. They demanded the surrender of the people responsible for the attack. The culprits responded by murdering thirty pro-Achaean citizens, seceding from the League and requesting Roman tutelage.Cartledge and Spawforth, Hellenistic and Roman Sparta:A tale of two Cities, 78 The Romans, who wanted to see division in the League, did nothing about the situation. In 188, Philopoemen entered northern Laconia with an army and the Spartan exiles who insisted on returning to Sparta. He first massacred eighty anti-Achaeans at Compasium, and then had the wall that Nabis built around Sparta demolished. Philopoemen then restored the exiles and abolished Spartan law, introducing Achaean law in its place. Thus ended Sparta's role as a major power in Greece, while Achaea became dominant throughout the Peloponnese.Cartledge and Spawforth, Hellenistic and Roman Sparta:A tale of two Cities, 79 Notes On one side is the head of Nabis with a short beard, whiskers and a bound laurel wreath that is tied at the back of his neck.

Buenaventura (Spanish for \\"good fortune\\") is the main port of Colombia in the Pacific Ocean. Buenaventura is a city with a population of 333,194 as of the 2005 census (most of city development lies on Cascajal Island) and it is the size of Los Angeles' metropolitan area; most of the city's land is rural with scattered small villages throughout. It is served by the Gerardo Tobar L√≥pez Airport. The city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network after it was named \\"City of Gastronomy\\" in 2017. History The city was founded on July 14, 1540, by Juan de Ladrilleros through orders from Pascual de Andagoya. At that time it was inhabited by the Buscajas. The city was destroyed by Native Americans before 1600; it was later rebuilt. Buenaventura thrived after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914; and in the 1950s became a regular stopover for the 'international jet set'. Today, the city is crucial for sending raw materials to nearby areas; this has brought prosperity and allowed recent new development to occur. Demographics The city is, as of 2011, affected by very high levels of poverty and violence, and is considered a center for the cocaine trade in Colombia. Buenaventura's population is mostly of African descent 85% ‚Äî while 10% are Mestizo and 5% are White. Transport =Port= The city is one of the major ports on the continent, accounting for nearly 60% of all Colombian sea imports and exports. However, due to its strategic position, the city's economy has been hampered by gang-related activity fighting over control of the port, making it among the most impoverished cities in Colombia. =Rivers= The city is surrounded by an immense number of rivers, including: the Dagua; the Anchicay√°; the Calima; the Raposo; the Mayorqu√≠n; the Cajambre; the Yurumangu√≠; and part of the right arm of the Naya River and part of the left arm of the River San Juan at its mouth. In addition, it has an enormous amount of streams and smaller rivers, such as Agua Clara, San Marcos, Sabaletas, San Cipriano and Escalerete, which supplies the municipal capital through a modern aqueduct. =Road= Well paved and maintained roads, that are designed to be unaffected by landslides, leave the city via Loboguerrero, where it divides to go to Cali, or Buga and then onwards to the cities of Armenia, Medell√≠n and Bogot√°. This route is known as \\"La V√≠a al Mar\\", as it connects large and different parts of the country together. =Airport= Gerardo Tobar L√≥pez Airport connects Buenaventura with direct flights of 1 hour 20 minutes to Bogot√° via Satena, as well as to other cities. Crime Buenaventura has had a notorious history plagued by the Colombian armed conflict, drug trafficking, violence, and the presence of guerrilla and paramilitary groups. Colombian authorities have seized almost US$28 million in cash from drug kingpins. The money found was in several shipping containers sent from Manzanillo, Colima (Mexico) and Houston (United States), that belonged to brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, also known as the ‚ÄòCombas‚Äô.http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/5946-colombian- authorities-hauled-drug-money-almost-us-28-million.html Between 2008 and 2010, the number of reported homicides in the city doubled. In 2010, the murder rate of Buenaventura was 175.2 homicides per 100,000, a rate 24 times that of New York City. To counter the violence, the Colombian government has set up a marine special forces unit in the worst area of the city. In 2011, it seemed that counter-violence efforts had improved crime metrics, even while aspects of the Colombian drug war in that city worsened. According to community activist Victor Hugo Vidal, \\"If you ask the authorities, they will tell you [the city] is better -- that the homicide rates are way down. But for us [living here], during the last 10 years, there has been no change.\\" Education =Universities= The city hosts many higher education universities, both private and public: Public *Universidad del Valle - it is the leading academic institution in south-western Colombia, with the third-highest student population in the country.

(Despite the name, it is not closely related to orchids). It is called lluvia de orquideas or terciopelo in Spanish, krua on in Thai, and rong bao teng in Chinese. Native to Myanmar and Thailand, it can be found elsewhere in South Asia, including Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia (Kedah), China (Yunnan), Bangladesh, and India (Assam, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal). Its native habitat is mixed forests 600‚Äì1200 meters above sea level.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesFlora of China Vol. 17 Page 49 ÁªíËãûËó§ rong bao teng Congea tomentosa Roxburgh, Pl. Coromandel. 3: 90. 1820. This tropical vine has been naturalized elsewhere, including the islands of the Caribbean, southern Florida, and southern California. In the United States, Wooly Congea can be grown outdoors in USDA zones 10 and 11. It does not tolerate frost. The plant can grow to 3‚Äì5 meters (10‚Äì16 feet) in cultivation and even larger in its native state. The stems, leaves and bracts are covered with fine, downy hairs. The leaves are light green in color, 6-8 inches (15.2-20.3 centimeters) long, and quite attractive. They are evergreen with prominent veins and are arranged in opposite pairs. The actual flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, but they are borne in the center of three showy white or violet 1 inch (2.5 centimeter) long bracts that look like velvety propellers. Wooly Congea blooms in late winter to spring. From late winter to spring it produces sprays of white flowers backed by bracts. The bracts gradually change through pink, lavender, and finally gray over the course of several weeks. Cultivation It can be grown as a trailing or climbing vine, or pruned as a shrub. In frost-prone climates, it is grown in a warm greenhouse or conservatory. One should use a soil-based potting compost, provide maximum light but shade from direct sun, provide supports for the stems, and prune after flowering to contain the plant. Outdoors, it should be grown in moisture-retentive, fertile soil in full sun. It can be propagated from seed or semi-ripe cuttings and provided with bottom heat for both. Wooly Congea is easy to grow in almost any soil type. It should be watered regularly. Uses and gallery Whole branches with their flowering clusters are useful in cut flower arrangements.

He was also known as Tani Kanj≈ç. Biography =Early life= Tani was born in Kubokawa village, Tosa Province (present-day Shimanto town, K≈çchi Prefecture) as the 4th son of a Confucian scholar. All three of his elder brothers died in childhood, and he was given to his uncle to be raised as an upper-class samurai in the service of the Yamauchi clan. His abilities were soon noted by clan officials,a and he was sent for further studies in Edo in 1859. While in Edo, he studied under Yasui Sokken and other leading Confucian scholars, and returned to Tosa in 1861. In 1862, he was appointed an instructor at the Chid≈çkan, the han school; however, he also became involved in the local Sonn≈ç j≈çi movement led by Takechi Hanpeita. He was one of the members of Takechi's followers implicated in the assassination of Yoshida T≈çy≈ç. Following Takechi's arrest and execution, he was out of favor until 1865, when he was allowed to resume his duties at the Chid≈çkan. In 1866, he was ordered by his domain to go to Nagasaki, where he met Got≈ç Sh≈çjir≈ç and Sakamoto Ry≈çma, who gradually convinced him of the futility of attempting to preserve Japan's national isolation policy. In 1867, he made a secret trip to Shanghai, where he observed first-hand the military superiority of the western powers and the possible fate which awaited Japan. After his return, he agreed to work with Saig≈ç Takamori, whom he med in Edo the following year, and to work for an alliance between Tosa and Satsuma. =Military career= Jinshotai(From the left in the bottom row: Ban Gondayu, Itagaki Taisuke, Tani Otoi(young boy), Yamaji Motoharu. From the left in the middle row: Tani Shigeki(Sinbei), Tani Tateki(Moribe), Yamada Kiyokado(Heizaemon), Yoshimoto Sukekatsu(Heinosuke). From the left in the top row: Kataoka Masumitsu(Kenkichi), Manabe Masayoshi(Kaisaku), Nishiyama Sakae, Kitamura Shigeyori(Chobei), Beppu Hikokuro.) From 1868, Tani fought in the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate, beginning with the Battle of Toba- Fushimi, the Battle of K≈çsh≈´-Katsunuma and continuing with the Battle of Aizu. In 1869, he was appointed a junior councilor, and spent the next three years in Tosa, reforming the clan's government, while his fellow clansmen, Itagaki Taisuke and Got≈ç Sh≈çjir≈ç remained in Tokyo. He spoke out strongly against the profligate spending of the Tosa delegation in Tokyo and enacted cost reduction measures, which enraged Got≈ç, who had Tani removed. However, this did not solve the underlying problem to the clan's finances, as Tani was returned to his post in April 1871. Following the establishment of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1872, Tani accepted the rank of major general. He became commander of the Kumamoto garrison the following year, and worked closely with Yamagata Aritomo to reform the army along French lines, over the opposition of Itagaki and Kirino Toshiaki, He personally led troops to suppress a number of samurai uprisings in Ky≈´sh≈´, including the Saga Rebellion and Shimp≈´ren Rebellion, and withstood a siege of 52 days in Kumamoto castle against Saig≈ç Takamori during the Satsuma Rebellion. Tani also took part in the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, where one of the US foreign advisors of the expedition, Lt. Cdr. Douglas Cassel, would criticize him as a \\"little imbecile\\" in private letters to Charles Le Gendre.Eskildsen, Robert. An Army as Good and Efficient as Any in the World: James Wasson and Japan‚Äôs 1874 Expedition to Taiwan (Asian Cultural Studies 36, 2010), p.54 In November 1878, Tani was promoted to lieutenant general and was commandant of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and the Toyama School. He retired in March 1881 in protest over government policies and returned to K≈çchi. =Political career= After returning to K≈çchi in 1881, Tani was one of the founders of the conservative political party, Ch≈´seit≈ç, which was created to challenge Itagaki's Freedom and People's Rights Movement. He also became president of the Gakush≈´in Peers‚Äô School in 1884. Tani's political views, as they became known in the 1880s and the 1890s were a mix of conservatism, liberalism and staunch anti-Imperialism.Tani was one of the leaders of a group called the \\"conservative opposition\\", an alliance of retired generals, politicians and peers who were critical both of the Meiji government and the movement for popular rights. Leading members in the conservative opposition, including Tani, believed that the \\"nation\\" is composed of a mystical union between Emperor and people, and therefore the government should rest neither with the oligarchs nor with the political parties. In his constitutional proposals, Tani had suggested to raise the Emperor to a status of an arbitrator between three independent branches of government - the executive, the judicial and the legislative, balanced by a set of checks and balances but dependent on the discretion of the Imperial Throne. Though critical as for the \\"selfishness\\" of the political parties, he was a supporter of the freedoms of speech and assembly. In 1885, Tani joined the first It≈ç Hirobumi cabinet as the first Minister of Agriculture & Commerce, however, he soon resigned over dissatisfaction with what he perceived to be the weak and vacillating foreign policy of Inoue Kaoru, especially with regards to the revision of the unequal treaties. Tani's views on foreign policy were a mix of anti-Imperialism and belief in Japan's national essence (Kokutai). As young general, during the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, he advocated occupying southern China,Tani Kanj≈ç, Tani Kanj≈ç Ik≈ç, Nihon Shiseki Ky≈çkai, ed. (Tokyo: Tokyo Daigaku Shuppan Kai, 1975-6), vol 2., p.71 but in the 1880s he reversed his position. He resisted the reforms of Yamagata Aritomo in the army, and believed that Imperial Japanese Army should be kept as a small force for defensive purposes alone. Along with the generals Miura Goro, Torio Koyata and Soga Sukenori he was a co-founder of the \\"four generals group\\" who resisted the Prussia-model military reforms of the 1800s.Shin'ichi Kitaoka, \\"The Army as a Bureaucracy: Japanese Militarism Revisited,\\" The Journal of Military History 57:5 (October, 1993), 71-2 Even after the Sino- Japanese War of 1894 to 1895, when all of Tani's friends to the conservative opposition became enthusiastic about territorial expansion, he was staunchly against any advance to the continent. On the other hand, he was set against any concession to the foreigners in the struggle against the unequal treaties and believed Japan must refrain from alliances with great powers in order to uphold its own unique culture, tradition and national essence. Tani's unique position as a rare anti-Imperialist thinker in the Japanese military establishment, earned him a description by Mutsu Munemitsu, Japan's foreign minister, as a \\"lone flower in a field of grass.\\"The Conservative Opposition in Japanese Politics: 1877-1894 (PhD thesis: University of Washington, 1955), 1-50; Hata Ikuhiko, \\"Binhi Satsugai Jiken no saik≈çsatsu\\", Seikei Kenky≈´ 43:2, pp. 76-7 On July 7, 1884, Tani was ennobled with the rank of shishaku (viscount) in the kazoku peerage system. Tani's political views were also influenced by a visit he made to Europe from June 1887 to March 1888. He met with Ahmed  ªUrabi in Egypt and saw parallels with Japan's predicament of becoming exhausted by foreign debt created by too-rapid industrialization, and lamented Japan's increasing westernization. He also attended a lecture by Lorenz von Stein in Austria promoting Agrarianism as a political philosophy. Tani became a member of the House of Peers in 1890. He remained active in politics until his death, strongly opposing imposition of land taxes, favoring the abolishment of poll taxes, sending an investigative team to the Ashio Copper Mine in wake of a lawsuit and scandal over an environmental disaster, and continuing to be a thorn in the side of Yamagata and his efforts to expand the Japanese army. He strongly opposed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and also opposed the Russo-Japanese War from both a political standpoint and for financial reasons. With the Japanese victory, he was increasingly marginalize in politics and vilified in the media; yet his insistence on mutual demilitarization and free passage between the Soya Strait and the Mamiya Strait were worked into the Portsmouth Treaty ending the war. He died in 1911 at the age of 75.

Life Born in Valenciennes, he was probably the son of a castellan of the town mentioned in 1141. He seems to appear in the official record in 1180. After the accession of Baldwin IX as Count of Flanders in 1194 he appears on several important acts of Baldwin, including the treaty between the latter and Richard Lionheart in June/July 1197 and another in 1199 with John Lackland. He took the cross alongside his suzerain; in the spring 1203, in Corfu, he was one of the few leaders who advocated in favor of the diversion of the Fourth Crusade to Constantinople. After the conquest of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire, Renier was granted Philippopolis and the territory as far as the river Maritsa by Emperor Baldwin I following the October 1204 partition of the conquered and yet to be conquered lands of the Byzantine Empire. Renier's land lay within the realm of Bulgaria, in territory claimed by Byzantium and subsequently the Franks. Renier's first campaigns that fall and winter to take possession of his imperial fief were successful, but the next year Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan swooped down and took Adrianople and threatened Philippopolis. Renier was abandoned by his son Renier, his brother Gilles, his nephew James of Bondues and his son-in-law Achard of Verli, which tried to go to Constantinople but were captured and executed by Kaloyan. With only a small force remaining at his command, Renier holed up in the castle of Stenimaka. It was during an effort to relieve Adrianople that Emperor Baldwin was captured. In the summer of 1205, the Paulicians of Philippopolis tried to surrender the city to Kaloyan, but Renier sallied from his fortress and razed their quarter of the city, leaving the rest to the brave defence of the united Latin and Greek populations, who declared Alexios Aspietes as emperor. Nevertheless, the city was taken and the Greek quarter burned. Later that same year, the imperial regent Henry of Flanders marched into Bulgaria and relieved Stenimaka and Renier in July 1206.

He has also been featured in three short stories written by Horowitz based in the same canon as the series; Secret Weapon, Christmas at Gunpoint and Incident in Nice. Alex is a boy who works for MI6, the British international intelligence service. When fourteen years old, Alex was forced into this occupation after MI6 noticed Alex's many talents. He has not only worked for MI6, but also the CIA, Scorpia (in Scorpia), and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (in Snakehead). In the film adaption of Stormbreaker, Alex Rider was portrayed by Alex Pettyfer. Development Horowitz came up with the idea for the series when he thought about creating a teenage equivalent of James Bond. He initially considered several possible names for the character, including Jack Banning, Tom Summers, Zac Marshall, Scott Winters, Dylan Beckett, Miles Longman, Sean Reeves, Jake Keaton, Adam Whitehead, Kai Bexter, Marcus Edwards, Liam Skye, Connor West, Kyle Fisher, Bradley Roberts, Callum Gates, Rupert Halliwell and Ben Shires, before finally settling on Alex Rider. Rider's last name comes from the Bond girl Honeychile Rider from the novel Dr. No.As stated by Horowitz in his Intelligence Squared debate, Ian Fleming vs John le Carr√© Alex was originally to have had dark hair, but after Horowitz saw several surveys that said teenage girls preferred blonde boys, he created him as fair haired instead. About the character Alex has a birthday on February 12, 1987. The book series happens during 2001. Before Alex became involved with MI6, he wanted to be a professional football player, but now is unsure of what he wants to do when he finishes school. Alex once joked that he wanted to be a train driver. He has stated many times that he is not interested in becoming a full-time MI6 agent. Alex's athletic talents greatly assist him during his missions many times: for example, in Point Blanc he snowboards down a mountain on an ironing board to escape Point Blanc Academy, in Skeleton Key he scuba dives into Skeleton Key, in Scorpia he base jumps into a factory, in Ark Angel he walks between two apartment buildings on a tightrope and in Snakehead, he kayaks down a river on a makeshift kayak. As the series progresses, Alex becomes more skilled at spying. He later pursues Damian Cray alone after MI6 refuse to investigate him, and is recruited by the CIA in the United States, and later by the ASIS in Australia although in each case only for specific missions. Physical appearance Alex Rider is described as a strikingly attractive 14-year-old boy, with fair hair, and a handsome, slender face, and an appealing expression that \\"would attract plenty of girls\\". He has serious dark-brown eyes and a slightly hard, narrow mouth. Alex is well-built and slim, and has a tan. He is also mentioned to have a birthmark on his left shoulder. He is very fit, being described as having \\"the body of an athlete.\\" Alex is 5' 7\\" tall and weighs 140 lbs although this conflicts with the data presented in the film. He prefers wearing casual clothing such as jeans and T-shirts and is occasionally described as wearing a wooden bead necklace. In the later novels, even though Alex stays fourteen (until the end of Crocodile Tears) he is described as looking older, due to the emotional and physical stress he endures because of his missions. Also, his injuries gradually accumulate. After the novel Scorpia, he has a bullet wound, as well as several scars and bruises from previous assignments. In the last book, Alex, who is now fifteen, is described with longer hair, being 5'10\\", with broader shoulders and that, through the years, he had lost his \\"little-boy looks that had been so useful to Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones\\".Scorpia Rising (The Final Mission) chapter 7 Relationships =Jack Starbright= One of Alex's closest friends is Jack Starbright. With his uncle having been away on secret missions for MI6 much of the time, Alex has spent a lot of time with Jack. Alex met Jack when she came from America to study law in London, and being employed by his uncle as a housekeeper and to watch over Alex, who was seven years old at the time. She has known Alex for seven years. After Ian died, Jack became Alex's guardian. Even though it was originally her job to care for Alex, they have grown attached and their relationship has become very personal. However, as Alex's MI6 life starts to take a toll on him, it also places somewhat of a strain on their relationship - Jack is always very worried and upset that Alex's life is constantly being put in danger. In Scorpia Rising, Jack learns that her father is sick and needs someone to look after him. Jack decides that she needs to tell Alex that she must leave in order to care for her father, but she first decides to accompany Alex to Egypt for his mission. After the two are captured by Razim's men, Jack comes to experience, for the first time, what it has been like for Alex on a mission. She attempts to escape, and nearly succeeds, but Razim is merely using her for his \\"measurement of pain\\" experiment, and has Julius Grief detonate a bomb on the Land Rover she is driving, killing her instantly. Alex's grief is enough to cause him to black out, and Razim \\"may even have to create a second scale of measurement\\" for the amount of emotional pain Alex felt. However, Jack is revealed to be alive in the following novel Never Say Die, as her death was faked by other members of Scorpia as part of their plans to set up a complex hostage situation involving taking a school bus of wealthy children prisoner, with Alex eventually managing to rescue her. =Sabina Pleasure= Throughout the novels, Sabina Pleasure becomes one of Alex's closest friends.The two first met while working as ball boys/girls at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships and they quickly became good friends. Sabina soon became suspicious when Alex had to leave the Championships early, and more so when Sabina saved Alex's life, and Alex then disappears on a mission for several weeks. Alex's constant disappearances place a real difficulty on their relationship, and when Sabina finally finds out the truth about Alex, things turn out differently for them. Alex's relationship with Sabina takes a turn during their first holiday in Cornwall, when the two share a slight kiss one night. The next day they went out for a surfing trip, when Alex is knocked out by a massive wave and Sabina gives him CPR. Sabina soon leaves Britain to live in America. Although Alex suspects he will never see her again, she later sends him a card when Alex is in the hospital after being shot by a sniper. She shows up at the end of Snakehead to have dinner with him. She then invites him to celebrate New Year with her family in Scotland, where the plot of Crocodile Tears begins and also shares another kiss with him, hinting that her feelings for him may still exist. In Scorpia Rising, Alex and Sabina are revealed to be in a relationship, and struggling with the long distance between them. At the end of the book, after the apparent death of Jack while on a mission in Egypt, Sabina's family become his new legal guardians. By the start of Never Say Die, Alex and Sabina remain friends, but have fallen out of love with each other, as Sabina is now in a relationship with a football player at her new school.  Mrs. Tulip Jones  An assistant to Alan Blunt, Alex first met Ms. Jones when she briefed him for his first mission. Ms. Jones is very sympathetic to Alex, and offers reassurance when Alex is uneasy about what is required to do for his missions. Tulip Jones shows great concern for Alex's situation - often protesting that he is not to be used again, but all the while admitting that he is useful to MI6. She shows signs of great attachment to Alex, of an almost motherly kind. Tulip Jones also has hinted that she has had children (at least two) and that they were taken from her, which could contribute to why she has so much sympathy for Alex. In Scorpia, Alex breaks into her apartment with the intent of assassinating her, after Scorpia manipulate him into believing that she ordered the assassination of his father, but changes his mind at the last moment even without learning that she actually helped his father fake his death. In the last book, Nightshade, it is revealed Ms. Jones had a son and a daughter who were both employed by the criminal organisation Nightshade. Alex helps get her daughter Sophia back.  Yassen Gregorovich  Alex first met the Russian contract killer who killed his uncle on Herod Sayle's ground during his mission in Stormbreaker. At the time, Alex originally vows to kill him. Later, during the events of Eagle Strike, it is revealed that Gregorovich worked with Alex's father John 15 years prior. When Gregorovich's friend captures Alex, Gregorovich is able to arrange for Alex to do bullfighting instead of being shot directly, leading to Alex being able to escape. At the end of the novel, when Damian Cray (the man who hired Gregorovich) orders him to kill Alex, he refuses and is shot and killed. Before dying, Gregorovich tells Alex that he worked with his father and to go to Venice and find Scorpia to find his destiny.

Horowitz gave Pettyfer intense guidance on becoming the character of Alex Rider, expressing him and bringing his athletic talents, intellect and charm to the screen. The role of Alex Rider was said to be the most physically demanding ever taken by a child actor. Pettyfer undertook martial arts training with Hong Kong martial arts choreographer Donnie Yen,http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEbhnbecuWfXee as well as horseback riding. Pettyfer did most of his own stunts in the film, and underwent major physical preparation for the role. Pettyfer was fifteen years old at the time of the film's shooting, a year older than his character. He is not expected to reprise his role in any future Alex Rider films, because he is now too old.

Biography  William Lee Brent was born in 1931, in Franklin, Louisiana, and when he was 13 his family moved to Oakland, California. Brent was selling drugs and committing petty crimes by the time he was in junior high school, and at age 17 he enlisted in the US Army by using a fake birth certificate. He was discharged from the army after only eight months, later serving time in juvenile hall for stealing a bicycle. In 1955, he was convicted of armed robbery and auto theft, for which he spent seven years in San Quentin State Prison. On April 21, 1964, Brent married Gloria L. Harness, age 30, in Oakland.  Black Panther Party activity  In November 1968, Brent and two accomplices in a van marked \\"Black Panther Black Community News Service\\" allegedly robbed a gas station in San Francisco's Bayview district of $80. Police caught up to them on Seventh Street near the Hall of Justice, prompting a shootout, where one of the officers, Lieutenant Dermott Creedon, was critically wounded. When Brent was arrested and identified as the triggerman, Eldridge Cleaver kicked him out of the Black Panther Party, accusing him of \\"banditry\\".Fimrite, Peter, William Lee Brent -- former Black Panther hijacked jet to Cuba, San Francisco Chronicle, November 20, 2006 After his arrest, Brent was released on bail, and on June 17, 1969, he stepped onto Trans World Airlines Flight 154 from Oakland to New York City. Brent held a .38 Caliber revolver to the pilot's head, and ordered him to fly to Cuba instead.Jocelyn Y. Stewart, William Lee Brent, 75; Black Panther hijacked plane to Cuba, Nov 20, 2006 LA Times Brent spent 22 months in an immigration jail in Cuba when he arrived, and after his release he earned a Spanish literature degree from the University of Havana, and taught English at various junior and senior high schools. He never became a Cuban citizen, but remarried to travel writer Jane McManus (ca. 1920 - 2005) whom he had met in Cuba. In a 1996 interview with Associated Press, Brent said he missed the United States and the African-American community, but he was unwilling to return to possibly face life imprisonment for air piracy and kidnapping. Around 1996, Times Books published his memoirs, Long Time Gone (), and for several years prior to his death Brent was working on a book about discrimination against Black people in Cuba.  Death  Brent died from pneumonia on November 4, 2006 at age 75, while still living in Cuba.

They are used as transmitting antennas below 1 MHz, in the MF, LF and particularly the VLF bands, at frequencies sufficiently low that it is impractical or infeasible to build a full size quarter-wave monopole antenna. The outer end of each radial wire, sloping down from the top of the antenna, is connected by an insulator to a supporting rope or (usually) insulated cable anchored to the ground; the radial wires can also support the mast as guy wires. The radial wires make the antenna look like the frame of a giant umbrella ‚Äì without the cloth ‚Äì hence the name.  Design  The antenna is supported by a central mast, usually a steel tubular or lattice mast. The conductive mast is usually insulated from the ground and connected at its base to the feedline from the transmitter and serves as the radiating element (although some antennas use vertical wires suspended parallel to the mast). At the top of the mast are attached a ring of equally spaced diagonal wires extending down to the ground where they are anchored usually with concrete anchors. A strain insulator inserted in each wire at a certain height blocks the antenna current from reaching the ground, so the antenna consists of the mast and the upper portions of the umbrella wires, while the lower portions just serve to anchor the wires to the ground and may be made of nonconductive rope. The wires may also serve structurally as guy lines to support the mast. Under the antenna is a large ground (Earthing) system consisting of wires buried in the Earth extending radially from the base of the mast out to the edge of the topload wires, connected to the other side of the transmitter feedline.

File:Woodside VLF Transmitter - top of mast.jpgTop of 432 m mast of station G Omega antenna, Victoria, Australia, showing insulators attaching the 16 umbrella wires to the mast  How it works  The vertical mast, isolated from the ground by a supporting ceramic insulator, functions as a resonant monopole antenna. At the low frequencies used, the height of the mast is much less than its resonant length, one quarter wavelength (\\\\lambda/4), so it makes a very electrically short antenna; it has very low radiation resistance and without the topload wires would be a very inefficient radiator. The oscillating current from the transmitter travels up the mast and splits approximately equally between the topload wires. It is reflected from the ends of the wires and travels back down the mast. The outgoing and reflected current superpose, forming a standing wave consisting of the tail part of a sine wave. Due to the symmetrical placement of the wires, and ground reflections, the radio waves radiated by the umbrella wires largely cancel out far from the antenna, so the wires themselves do not radiate much radio power. Instead the umbrella-wires function as a capacitive top load adding capacitance to the top of the antenna. The capacitance increases the current in the vertical mast due to the extra current required to charge and discharge the topload capacitance each RF cycle, increasing the radiated power. The buried ground wires under the antenna function as the bottom plate of the 'capacitor'. To tune out the large capacitive reactance of the antenna and make it resonant at the operating frequency so it can be fed power efficiently, a large inductor (loading coil) is placed in the feedline in series with the antenna, at its base. The other side of the feedline from the transmitter is connected to the ground system. The antenna and coil form a tuned circuit. Their large reactance and low resistance usually give the antenna a high Q_factor, so it has a narrow bandwidth over which it can work. In large umbrella antennas used in the very low frequency band, the bandwidth of the antenna can be less than 100 hertz. An umbrella antenna can alternatively be fed power by applying the transmitter current to one or more of the radial wires instead of the mast. In this case the central mast is grounded. This design is advantageous in high power antennas which operate at high voltages, because it does not require an expensive mast support insulator at bottom to keep the high voltage on the mast from ground. It also does not require an isolator in the power cables for the mast's aircraft warning lights. This construction was used in three large umbrella antennas for the obsolete Omega navigation system which operated at 10 - 14 kHz, to eliminate the very difficult problem of insulating the mast base against the 200 kV antenna potential. Below are several grounded mast umbrella antenna variations developed by the US military in the 1970s for use on the low frequency band. File:Pan polar antenna.pngPan polar antenna File:Nord antenna.pngNord antenna  Radiation pattern  Umbrella antennas radiate vertically polarised radio waves in an omnidirectional radiation pattern, with equal power emitted in all horizontal directions, with maximum signal strength radiated in horizontal directions, falling monotonically with elevation angle to zero at the zenith. Due to the large topload they are usually more efficient than the other common toploaded antenna, the flattop or T antenna, at low frequencies, and are widely used in the VLF band. Ground waves are vertically polarized waves which travel away from the antenna horizontally just above the ground. Therefore umbrella antennas are good ground wave antennas, and are used as radio broadcasting antennas in the MF and LF bands. The gain of an umbrella antenna, like other electrically short monopole antennas, is approximately 3.52 dBi if it is significantly shorter than \\\\lambda/4. Since the diagonal wires are sloped down, the current in them has a vertical component. This current is in a direction opposite to the current in the mast, so far from the mast the radio waves radiated by it are 180¬∞ out of phase with the radio waves from the mast, and partially cancel them. Thus the umbrella wires partially shield the mast, reducing the power radiated. With enough umbrella wires all the radio waves emitted by the portion of mast above the bottom of the umbrella is blocked, and the only radiation is from the portion of the mast below the umbrella. Applications Due to their large capacitive topload, umbrella antennas are some of the most efficient antenna designs at low frequencies, and are used for transmitters in the LF and VLF bands for navigational aids and military communication. They are in common use for commercial medium-wave and longwave AM broadcasting stations. Umbrella antennas with heights of 15‚Äì460 metres are in service. The largest umbrella antennas are the trideco antennas (below) built for VLF naval transmitting stations which communicate with submerged submarines. Eight umbrella antennas 350 metres high are in use in an array at the German VLF communications facility, operating at about 20 kHz with high radiation efficiency even though they are less than wavelength high. With the progressing world-wide adoption of two new amateur radio bands at 630 metres and 2200 metres, amateurs with adequate real estate have resumed use of this design.  Trideco antenna  The trideco antenna is a huge specialized umbrella antenna used in a few high power transmitters at very low frequency (VLF). In a conventional umbrella antenna, the use of the sloping guy wires as the capacitive top load has some disadvantages: First, since the umbrella wires must be anchored to the ground, their length is limited. At low frequencies the length of topload wires required is far longer than can be used for guy wires, without additional supporting masts the wires would sag to the ground. Second, since the wires are sloping, the current in them has a vertical component. This vertical current is in the opposite direction to the current in the mast, so the radio waves radiated by it are 180¬∞ out of phase with the mast radiation, and partially cancels it. In the trideco design the top load wires extend horizontally from the top of the central mast, supported by a ring of 12 masts surrounding the central mast, to create a \\"capacitor plate\\" parallel with the Earth, driven at the center. The topload wires are in the form of six rhomboidal (diamond) shaped panels extending symmetrically from the central mast at angles of 60¬∞, giving the antenna the form of a six-pointed star when seen from above. Instead of using the central mast itself as a radiator, each panel is connected to a vertical radiator wire next to the central mast, and the six radiator wires are fed in phase at the base. This allows the possibility of shutting down power to one of the panels, and lowering it to the ground for maintenance while the rest of the antenna is operating. Buried in the ground under the antenna is an enormous radial ground system, which forms the bottom 'plate' of the capacitor with the overhead top load. The antenna must be very large at the VLF frequencies used; the supporting masts are high, and the topload is about in diameter. The trideco antenna was developed for high power naval transmitters, which transmit on frequencies between 15 and 30 kHz at powers up to 2 megawatts, to communicate with submerged submarines worldwide. It is the most efficient antenna design found so far for this frequency range, achieving efficiencies of 70-80% where other VLF antenna designs have efficiency of 15-30% due to the low radiation resistance of the very electrically short monopole. The inspiration for the design was the umbrella antenna of the 1 megawatt Goliath transmitter built by Nazi Germany's navy in 1943 at Kalbe, Germany. The antenna was invented by Boynton Hagaman of Development Engineering Co. (DECO) and first installed at Cutler, Maine in 1961. Today trideco antennas are located at a few military bases around the world, such as Cutler naval radio station in Maine, USA, Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station, Exmouth, Australia, and Anthorn Radio Station, Anthorn, UK. A modified 3 panel antenna was located at NSS Annapolis, Annapolis, Maryland, USA but was decommissioned in 1990. History Umbrella antennas were invented during the wireless telegraphy era, about 1900 to 1920, and used with spark-gap transmitters on longwave bands to transmit information by Morse code. Low frequencies were used for long distance transcontinental communication, and antennas were electrically short, so capacitively toploaded antennas were used. Umbrellas developed from large multiwire capacitive antennas used by Guglielmo Marconi during his efforts to achieve reliable transatlantic communication. The first antenna that used this design was probably the tubular mast erected in 1905 by Reginald Fessenden for his experimental spark gap transmitter at Brant Rock, Massachusetts with which he made the first two-way transatlantic transmission, communicating with an identical antenna in Machrihanish, Scotland. The wires attached to the top (either 4 or 8, depending on source) were electrically connected to the mast and stretched diagonally down to the surface, where they were insulated from the ground. Another early example is the umbrella antenna built in 1906 by Adolf Slaby at Nauen Transmitter Station, Germany's first long range radio station, consisting of a steel lattice tower radiator with 162 umbrella cables attached to the top, anchored by hemp ropes to the ground 200 m from the tower. Small umbrella antennas were widely used with portable transmitters by military signal corps during World War I, since there was no possibility of setting up full-sized quarter-wave antennas. Umbrella antennas were used at most OMEGA Navigation System transmitters, operating around 10 kHz, and at LORAN-C stations, operating at 100 kHz with central masts approximately 200 metres tall, before those systems were shut down.

He was the first Saudi oil minister appointed by King Saud, and co- founder of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) along with Venezuelan minister Juan Pablo P√©rez Alfonso. Early life and education Tariki was born on 19 March 1919 in Al Zulfi () in Najd. He was the son of a camel owner who organized caravans between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Tariki received his early education in Kuwait and in Cairo. He held a bachelor's degree in geology and chemistry, which he obtained from Cairo University in 1944. He graduated from the University of Texas in 1947, earning a master's degree in petroleum engineering and geology. He was also trained at the Texas Oil Company after graduation. Career and activities After training in the US, Tariki returned to Saudi Arabia and worked at the ministry of finance office in Dammam from May 1953 to December 1954. He served as an interpreter at the initial phase of his career at the ministry. In December 1954, Tariki was appointed director-general of petroleum and mineral affairs in the ministry of finance and national economy. Tariki's work at the directorate involved processing the petroleum production statistics provided by Aramco, and analysis summaries were then presented to the Saudi royal family. In fact, Tariki was one of the earliest critics of Aramco, arguing that the US companies should consult more with Saudi officials in exploring, pumping and selling of oil. He called for the nationalization of Arab oil. To achieve this goal, he and Venezuela's mines minister Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso strongly supported the foundation of the OPEC and eventually became founding members of it in September 1960.Ibrahim, Youssef M.\\"Sheik Abdullah al-Tariki, 80, First Saudi Arabian Oil Minister,\\" New York Times. 16 September 1997.

Tariki joined Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz's camp, Free Princes Movement, in 1961, and they accused Crown Prince Faisal, later King Faisal, of corruption. Tariki became a powerful ally of the movement. He claimed on evidence that Kamal Adham, who was the brother- in-law of Prince Faisal, got 2% of the profits of the Arabian Oil Company that had been cofounded by Saudi Arabia and Japan. Tariki was removed from office by Prince Faisal in 1962. He was succeeded by Ahmed Zaki Yamani as oil minister. Yamani sacked Tariki also from Aramco's board. Later years Following his dismissal, Tariki went to exile and settled in Beirut. In January 1963, he and Lebanese oil expert Nicholas Sarkis founded an oil consulting firm in Beirut. Tariki also launched a journal there, namely Arab Oil and Gas. He could visit Saudi Arabia only after the death of King Faisal in 1975. Later he settled in Cairo.

Ord's kangaroo rat has a fifth toe on its hind feet, which distinguishes it from Dipodomys elator. It is bicolored with gold-brown dorsal hair and a white stomach. It has a long tail with a bushy tip, and is dark dorsally and ventrally with a white lateral stripe. Its hind feet are modified for jumping, and exceed 35 mm in length, and its total length exceeds 240 mm. Its tail is usually less than 160 mm, distinguishing it from D. elator (which exceeds 160 mm). Though a common species in the United States, the population in Canada is considered endangered. Taxonomy The currently accepted scientific name for Ord's kangaroo rat is Dipodomys ordii Woodhouse. It belongs to the family Heteromyidae, kangaroo rats and mice. HallHall, E. Raymond. 1981. The mammals of North America. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. New York: John Wiley and Sons listed 35 subspecies, but Kennedy and Schnell reported many of these subspecies are probably not legitimate since they were based on the assumption of little sexual dimorphism in the species. It has now been established that sexual dimorphism within the taxon is considerable. Distribution Ord's kangaroo rat ranges from southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan to southern Hidalgo, Mexico, and from central Oregon and eastern California east to central Kansas and Oklahoma. Ord's kangaroo rats occur mainly in semiarid, open habitats. In Nevada, they were trapped in desert scrub and gravelly soil, flat pebble desert, and washes.Eisenberg, John Frederick. 1963. The behavior of heteromyid rodents. University of California Publ. in Zoology: Vol. 69. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press In Utah, Ord's kangaroo rats have an affinity for open shrublands and grasslands on sandy soils. In southeastern Idaho, big sagebrush/crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) range, most Ord's kangaroo rat captures occurred on disturbed sites or areas of sparse cover: Russian thistle (Salsola kali), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), followed by disturbed areas seeded to crested wheatgrass, then undisturbed big sagebrush. In western South Dakota, Ord's kangaroo rats are associated with black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. In Wyoming, Ord's kangaroo rats are abundant in sand dune communities where vegetation is greater than 10 inches (25 cm) tall and bare soil exceeds 40%. In Colorado, Ord's kangaroo rats were primarily captured in open areas with firm soil. Firm or lightly compacted soils are needed for burrow construction; highly compacted soils are too hard for them to dig. In areas of desert pavement or tough clay soils in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, Ord's kangaroo rats are confined to pockets of windblown sand and alluvial soils along arroyos. Strong intraspecific competition and little interspecific competition occurs among Dipodomys species. In New Mexico, where Ord's kangaroo rats are sympatric with Merriam's kangaroo rats (D. merriamii), Ord's kangaroo rats were mostly captured in grassy microhabitats, and Merriam's kangaroo rats were captured more often around creosotebush. Herbicide defoliation of shrubs (for rangeland improvement) reduced live canopy cover of creosotebush and resulted in an increase in bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri). After treatment, Ord's kangaroo rats replaced Merriam's kangaroo rats as the dominant rodent. This was suggested to be due to the change in habitat structure to open grass. Removal experiments to establish single species populations of kangaroo rats were unsuccessful, since many kangaroo rats are transient and quickly occupy vacated habitats. Only one adult occupies a given burrow system, except for a brief period during breeding activity. Little territoriality occurs above ground except near burrow entrances, which are defended. In New Mexico, Ord's kangaroo rat annual home ranges in mesquite averaged 3.35 acres (1.36 ha). In Nevada sagebrush/grassland, Ord's kangaroo rat home ranges were estimated as 1.53 acres (0.62 ha) by the circular method and 1.06 acres (0.43 ha) by the principal component method. Home range movements increased through spring and again in late fall and early winter. No significant difference was found between male and female Ord's kangaroo rat home ranges; however, female home ranges decreased during reproductive periods. Recapture data for Ord's kangaroo rats in Arizona indicated they do not travel far from the home range; most Ord's kangaroo rats were recaptured within 165 ft (50 m) of the original capture site. Data on the lifetime movements of individuals indicated most were recaptured within 330 feet (100 m) of the original capture site. In sagebrush in the Great Basin, Ord's kangaroo rats reach an average density of 113 rats per 10 ha.West, N. E. 1983. Great Basin-Colorado plateau sagebrush semi-desert. In: Temperate deserts and semi-deserts. Amsterdam; Oxford; New York: Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company: 331‚Äì349. (Goodall, David W., ed. in chief; Ecosystems of the world; vol. 5) In intermountain salt-desert shrublands, the population density averaged 28 individuals per 10 ha in shadscale communities and 135 individuals per 10 ha in black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) communities.West, Neil E. 1983. Intermountain salt- desert shrubland. In: West, Neil E., ed. Temperate deserts and semi-deserts. Amsterdam; Oxford; New York: Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company; 1983: 375‚Äì397. (Goodall, David W., ed. in chief.; Ecosystems of the world; vol. 5) Plant communities Ord's kangaroo rats occur in communities on sandy soils, including semiarid grasslands, mixed-grass prairie, shrub- and scrublands, and pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands. In Canada, They are confined to open, sandy areas with sparse covers of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), rose (Rosa spp.), creeping juniper (J. horizontalis) and buffaloberry (Shepherdia spp.); the distribution of Ord's kangaroo rats appears to be closely associated with that of lanceleaved breadroot (Psoralea lanceolata).Banfield, A. W. F. 1974. The mammals of Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press In Oregon, Ord's kangaroo rats occur in big sagebrush (A. tridentata), western juniper (J. occidentalis), and greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.) communities. In Idaho, they are most abundant in juniper woodlands with rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.) and winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) in the understory, but also occur on shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) range. In Utah, Ord's kangaroo rats have an affinity for sagebrush, pinyon-juniper, and saltbush (Atriplex spp.) communities. In Nevada, Ord's kangaroo rats are associated with big sagebrush communities.Welch, Bruce L.; McArthur, E. Durant. 1985. Big sagebrush--its taxonomy, origin, distribution and utility. In: Fisser, Herbert G., ed. Wyoming shrublands: Proceedings, 14th Wyoming shrub ecology workshop; 1985 May 29‚Äì30; Rock Springs, WY. Laramie, WY: University of Wyoming, Department of Range Management, Wyoming Shrub Ecology Workshop: 3‚Äì19 In Colorado, Ord's kangaroo rats comprised 19% of small mammal captures in pinyon-juniper forest, scattered pinyon-juniper, and pinyon-juniper in canyon habitats. In New Mexico, Ord's kangaroo rats are found in yucca (Yucca spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), saltbush, and creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities.Mares, M. A.; Hulse, A. C. 1977. Patterns of some vertebrate communities in creosote bush deserts. In: Mabry, T. J.; Hunziker, J. H.; DiFeo, D. R., Jr., eds.

Stroudsburg, PA: Dowden, Hutchinson & Ross, Inc.: 209‚Äì226 They are particularly abundant in mesquite sand dunes. In Texas, Ord's kangaroo rats occur in honey mesquite (P. glandulosa), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), yucca, sand shinnery oak (Q. havardii), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) communities. In southwestern Kansas, Ord's kangaroo rats are characteristic residents of sand sagebrush prairie.Sexson, Mark L. 1983. Destruction of sandsage prairie in southwest Kansas. In: Proceedings, 7th North American prairie conference; 1980 August 4‚Äì6; Springfield, MO. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri: 113‚Äì115. Cover requirements Even in shrub-dominated communities, heteromyids including Ord's kangaroo rat tend to concentrate their activity in open areas between shrubs. Ord's kangaroo rats dig shallow burrows in loose sand in the sides of natural sand dunes, riverbanks, or road cuts. The one central burrow is surrounded by trails to feeding areas. The burrows have 3-in-diameter (7.6-cm-dia) openings. Small mounds are usually formed outside the entrance to the burrow. The burrow opening is usually plugged with soil during the day to maintain temperature and humidity within tolerable levels.Lechleitner, R. R. 1969. Wild mammals of Colorado. Boulder, CO: Pruett Publishing Company. They scoop out small, shallow depressions to be used as dusting spots. Lifecycle Ord's kangaroo rat Ord's kangaroo rats are nocturnal, and spend their days in deep burrows. Males are usually more abundant and active than females. Activity increases under cloud cover, particularly in winter. Ord's kangaroo rats are active year-round in Texas, but further north, they are seldom seen above ground in cold weather.Whitaker, John O., Jr. 1980. National Audubon Society field guide to North American mammals. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. Ord's kangaroo rat breeding season varies with subspecies and area. Usually, one or two peak breeding seasons occur per year, and in many areas, some breeding activity occurs year-round.Smith, H. Duane; Jorgensen, Clive D. 1975. Reproductive biology of North American desert rodents. In: Prakash, I.; Ghosh, P. K., eds. Rodents in desert environments. Monographiae Biologicae Vol. 28. The Hague, Netherlands: Dr. W. Junk: 305-330 The size of ovaries is significantly positively correlated with temperature. The average length of the breeding period is 6.8 months. In Texas, males are fertile all year, with peak reproductive activity occurring between August and March. Higher reproductive rates are associated with increased precipitation and food supply and decreased population density. In a favorable growing season, most females breed at least twice a year, but when population density increased, females did not breed until November though growing conditions and food supplies were favorable. In Arizona, the lowest proportion of males in breeding condition (about 60% of the male population) occurred in January and September‚ÄìOctober. The lowest number of females in breeding condition occurred in November, but at least a few females were breeding at that time. In Oklahoma, the two peaks in breeding activity are August‚ÄìSeptember and December through March. In many areas, the onset of breeding activity follows a period of rainfall the previous month. Gestation lasts 28 to 32 days; one to six embryos are usually found. In captivity, the maximum litter size was six young. The maximum number of litters produced per year by a captive female was five, the maximum number of litters per lifetime was 9, and the maximum number of young per female's lifetime was 38. The longest-lived Ord's kangaroo rat in captivity is a wild caught female who lived until 9 yr 1 months. Brown and Zeng calculated an annual death rate of 0.35 for all age classes. Food habits Ord's kangaroo rats are primarily granivorous and herbivorous. They consume a variety of foods, but most commonly eat the seeds of grasses and forbs, green vegetation, and dry vegetation. They occasionally consume animal material, mostly arthropods. In Colorado, seeds comprised 74% of their diets, forbs 13%, grasses and sedges 5%, arthropods 4%, and fungi and mosses 2%. In southeastern Idaho big sagebrush/crested wheatgrass range, Ord's kangaroo rats consumed (in order of proportion) pollen, arthropods, plant parts (Asteraceae) and crested wheatgrass seeds. A study of Ord's kangaroo rat foods in Texas found the primary foods consumed included seeds of sand paspalum (Paspalum stramineum), honey mesquite, sand bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), and rose-ring gaillardia (Gaillardia pulchella). In Texas, seeds of creosotebush, gramas (Bouteloua spp.) and dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) formed the major portion of Ord's kangaroo rat diets.Schmidly, David J. 1977. The mammals of Trans-Pecos Texas: including Big Bend National Park and Guadalupe Mountains National Park. College Station, TX: Texas A&M; University Seeds of mesquite, Russian-thistle, sunflowers (Helianthus spp.), and sandbur (Cenchrus spp.) are also major dietary items. Harvested seeds are transported in cheek pouches to burrows and consumed or cached there. Ord's kangaroo rats also cache seed in scattered shallow holes; this activity sometimes results in seedling emergence. They are easily able to retrieve shallowly buried seeds. A single Ord's kangaroo rat may make tens to hundreds of caches, each with tens to hundreds of seeds.Longland, William S. 1995. Desert rodents in disturbed shrub communities and their effects on plant recruitment. In: Roundy, Bruce A.; McArthur, E. Durant; Haley, Jennifer S.; Mann, David K., compilers.

Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station: 209‚Äì215 Kangaroo rats are physiologically adapted to arid environments. Most water is obtained from seeds and succulent plants. They drink water when it is available, but apparently do not require free water. Predators In the Great Basin sagebrush, intermountain sagebrush steppe, and intermountain salt desert shrublands, potential predators of Ord's kangaroo rats include coyotes (Canis latrans), kit fox (Vulpes velox), bobcats (Lynx rufus), badgers (Taxidea taxus), long-eared owls (Asio otus), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), hawks (Buteonidae and Falconidae), rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), and gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus).West, N.

The provincial Marxist movement at that date included just five socialist locals which divided their allegiances between the tiny Socialist Labor Party, the Canadian Socialist League, and the United Socialist Labor Party.Martin, Robin. Radical politics and Canadian labour, 1880-1930, p. 40, Industrial Relations Centre, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, 1968. Link retrieved Apr 24, 2013. In an effort to unify these scattered forces, a unity convention was held and the Socialist Party of British Columbia was formed. Provincial headquarters were established in the city of Vancouver.J.M. Milne, \\"History of the Socialist Party of Canada,\\", 1973; pg. 5. There was a strong American influence with the new organization, reflected in the group's leading personnel and programme. Chief provincial organizer of the SPBC was Ernest Burns, formerly an activist in the Social Democratic Federation in Great Britain before moving to North America where he organized for the People's Party and the Socialist Party in Washington.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pp. 40-41. The reform-oriented programme of the Socialist Party of America was adopted wholesale by the new Canadian group.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 41. This new unity proved short- lived, as the comparatively moderate orientation of the SPBC proved insufficient for the revolutionary socialist local organization in Nanaimo, which quickly broke from the SPBC to form the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Canada.Milne, History of the Socialist Party of Canada, pg. 6. Pressure for a radicalisation of the party was brought to bear and in January 1902 a second annual convention of the SPBC was held which was attended by delegates from 14 local groups, including a delegate of the Nanaimo-based Revolutionary Socialist Party of Canada. The Socialist Party of America's programme was scrapped and a new document eliminating all \\"immediate demands\\" was adopted.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pp. 41-42. Unity negotiations followed this left turn for the organization and in November 1902 the SBBC and the Revolutionary Socialist Party were successfully reunited by a membership referendum vote.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 42. Organizational unity was followed by a unified provincial newspaper in May 1903 when the Western Clarion was formed via the three-way merger of the Revolutionary Socialist Party's Clarion, the Vancouver-based Western Socialist, and the Strike Bulletin of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees. =Electoral success= The Socialist Party of British Columbia picked up a valuable adherent in 1903 when member of the provincial legislature James Hawthornthwaite switched his allegiance from the Lib-Lab alliance to the fledgling Socialist Party.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pp. 42-43. Hawthornthwaite won re-election in his Nanaimo riding in October 1903 tenth general election, where he was joined in the legislature by Parker Williams, a former Welsh coal miner who had lived previously in Alberta and Washington state.Robin, Radical Politics and Canadian Labour, pg. 43. The pair wound up holding the balance of power at the 1904 legislative session and were able to win legislative victories with respect to coal mine regulation, boiler inspections, and the 8-hour day. From December 30‚Äì31, 1904, the Socialist Party of Canada began to unify provincial socialists to gain legislative assembly seats and sit in opposition to the national government in Ottawa. The fourth annual convention of the Socialist Party of British Columbia was held. =BC affiliate of the Socialist Party of Canada= On February 19, 1905, the first meeting of a national revolutionary Marxist organization in Canada was held, seven years after beginnings of a national agenda for the Socialist League in the province Quebec. The first Socialist Party of Canada was formed by the Dominion Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of Canada by merging the provincial Socialist Party of British Columbia and related groups representing socialists in the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario. The Revolutionary Socialist Party, with links to manifestos for a national state of workers (workers' state), gained popularity. Socialist Party gained support especially from employees of coal mines and railways, and with immigrants from non-English speaking Europe, notably in the region of Nanaimo, Vancouver Island. The two-year-old Western Clarion newspaper became part of socialist propaganda in Canada. With a circulation of 4-10,000, it was published by E.T. Kingsley. James Hawthornthwaite and Parker Williams sat for two years with opposition seats in the provincial legislature of BC as members of the SPC.page 14, Imagine editors. \\"A timeline of the early years of the Socialist Party of Canada\\", source J M Milne, \\"Imagine\\", \\"Official Journal of the Socialist Party of Canada\\", Vol 5, No 1, Summer 2007.

Decorated year round with blue Christmas lights, it was actually the home of eccentric Indianapolis millionaire Skiles Edward Test. It gained a reputation for being haunted. According to local folklore, Skiles' deceased wife was embalmed in a glass coffin inside the house, surrounded by the eerie blue lights. Test himself encouraged the rumors when he began burying the remains of some of his 109 pet cats in carpeted caskets under brass nameplates. After Test's death, no evidence was discovered that indicated his wife was buried on the property, for, in fact, he had been married three times and all three women survived him. The public sale at auction of the possessions from the property did enhance the rumors of his eccentric later life. Nevertheless, the house was widely regarded as a \\"haunted\\" site well past Skiles' death in 1964, and is still recognized in the folklore and culture of Indianapolis. The house itself was originally of wood- frame construction, with a full exterior facade of white opaque glass brick. Many additions to the original farm house included glass solarium/greenhouses, and numerous lightning rods on the roof. A unique feature of the Test estate was an Olympic-sized swimming pool with a three-story diving tower and motorized surfboard pulley system, and alongside of the pool, an ornate brick \\"pool house\\" with guest quarters. The pool circulated its water through above ground pipes that were heated in the sun and recirculated in the pool to keep the water warm. This was the first solar-heated pool. Following the death of Skiles and the destruction of the house, his heirs bequeathed the property to Indy Parks and it was developed into a natural resource area called the Skiles Test Nature Park.Skiles Test Nature Park. Center for Earth and Environmental Science, Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis, IN. A view of the property from the air in 1937 can be found at the IUPUI Skiles Test Nature Park page.

Birth and childhood Karunakara Guru was born Karunakaran, into a modest family in the picturesque Chandiroor village in the Alappuzha district of Kerala on 1 September 1927. His mother, Karthyayani, was a devout housewife and his father Govindan, a well respected noble man. When the child was only nine months old, he suffered the loss of his father. After the death of his father, Karunakaran spent his childhood years in his mother Karthyayani's house. Even as a child, he maintained utmost cleanliness, austerity and a regular prayer routine. Around the age of 14, he left home to lead a monastic life and became an inmate of Advaita Ashram at Alwaye (near Kochi), a branch of Sivagiri Mutt, founded by the social reformer and Guru, Sree Narayana (1855‚Äì1928). The path to enlightenment He spent the next 17 years at various branches of Sivagiri Mutt, performing a wide variety of tasks, and worked without self interest, giving up all the comforts of food, sleep and rest. The seniors of the Mutt admired his rigorous work ethic, self negation and the perfection at which the many menial jobs were done! Everything was done with great care, and concern. While he was called a 'Santhi' (the priest), many devotees came to see him due to his attractive personality, and behavior that they fell in love with! Some experienced an aura in the simplicity of the child! After many years of searching for a real 'Guru', he found his 'Guru' Khureshia Fakir, in a chance meeting. Khureshia Fakir, the sufi saint recognized his long lost disciple, embraced him and said, \\"You've come at last!\\". And as he accompanied his 'Guru' in spiritual wanderings, the array of visions, and the experience of enlightenment in the life of a sage, soon began! In 1957, he left Sivagiri and moved to a hut on a nearby hill. This spot came to be called 'Santhigiri', by the locals, which roughly translates as the hill where Santhi, (the priest) resides. In 1968, he moved to Pothencode, near Thiruvananthapuram, where he had put up a thatched hut on a small piece of land donated by a well-wisher. He spent several years in meditation and prayer here, and shared his ideas of the proper way of worship, the 'Gurumargam' or knowing God by the way of 'Guru', and spent countless hours in discourse with the people who came to visit him daily, on a wide variety of subjects! Santhi, now 'Karunakara Guru', was a solace to the people that relentlessly came to him with illnesses, and problems. Many came with terminal illnesses like cancer, and strange mental/moral disorders or family problems. And as most were very poor, they had nowhere else to go. 'Karunakara Guru' would only pray for them and give them 'bhasmam' or holy ash, and without any wondrous feats, their illnesses would disappear. Santhigiri Ashram The Santhigiri Ashram is located 21 km from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala. Special events are held in August‚ÄìSeptember (birthday of Guru) and on 6 May (the day of the merger of Guru in eternal consciousness). Prayers are held every three hours, day and night, starting at 3:00 AM. Attractions include the resting place of the Guru in the form of a gigantic 91 feet high Lotus Parnasala built in marble, traditional Ayurveda and Siddha treatments and therapies. It is very near to tourist sites such as Varkala, Kovalam, Kanyakumari and Kerala backwaters. Admission is open to all regardless of sex, caste, creed or religion. The dress code is dhoti for men and sari for women for prayers and other spiritual functions. Women are banned during their menstrual cycles.

It is a fictionalised biographical study of the latter half of the reign of George III of the United Kingdom, his battle with mental illness, and the inability of his court to handle his condition. It was adapted for film in 1994 as The Madness of King George. Performance history The play had its premiere on 28 November 1991 at the Lyttelton Theatre of the National Theatre in London. It was directed by Nicholas Hytner and designed by Mark Thompson. The play starred Nigel Hawthorne as George III, Janet Dale as Queen Charlotte and Michael Fitzgerald as the Prince of Wales, also starring Julian Wadham, Charles Kay, Adrian Scarborough, Mark Lockyer and David Henry. After its London run, the production toured the UK and the United States, returned to the National Theatre in 1993 and was then presented in Athens and Israel in 1994. The play was staged at the Lowell Davies Festival Theatre in San Diego, California, June 19 - September 24, 2010. On 18 January 2012, the play was revived at the Apollo Theatre. David Haig played George III. A further revival took place in November 2018, at Nottingham Playhouse, with Mark Gatiss as the lead. This production was streamed on the National Theatre's YouTube channel in June 2020 as part of the NT at Home season. Reviews The play has been viewed as a character study for the actor who plays George III and most reviewers attribute its success to compelling performances from the two actors, Hawthorne and Haig, who played the king. Frank Rich of The New York Times singled out Nigel Hawthorne's performance in the US tour, calling it \\"astonishing\\" and \\"unforgettable\\", though he labelled the play itself as not \\"one of Bennett's major works\\" and as being more \\"marketable to Broadway and the colonies\\". Writing about the 2012 revival, Lyn Gardner said that Luscombe's production reminds us that \\"Bennett is not writing a royal Downton Abbey, but a play exploring appearance and reality\\", and that the play brings out the fact that amidst all the royal pomp the king is merely a man like everybody else. In The Telegraph, Charles Spencer praised Haig's performance, comparing it favorably to Hawthorne's performance twenty years earlier, saying \\"it seemed an impossible act to follow, but David Haig proves every inch Hawthorne‚Äôs equal in a performance of extraordinary emotion, tenderness and humour\\". Writing on the 2018 Nottingham Playhouse run, Kate Maltby, writing for The Guardian notes that \\"Scarborough and Gatiss are electric\\", praising Powell for her \\"endearing\\" portrayal of Queen Charlotte. She notes that \\"Gatiss delivers a tour de force\\" in this \\"viscerally repulsive depiction of the gap between public and private life.\\" even despite his descent into a \\"slobbering wreck\\" as George III. Maltby notes overall that this production is a \\"technically excellent production of a modern classic.\\" gaining it a 4 out of 5 rating.

Daily strip The first distinction in comic strips formats is between the daily comic strip and the Sunday strip. A daily strip is usually carried on a standard newspaper page, often alongside other strips and non-comics matter (such as crossword puzzles). It is usually printed as either a horizontal strip (longer than it is tall) or a box (roughly square) in black and white, although in recent years syndicates have offered daily strips in color, and newspapers with the ability to print it as such have done so. Sunday strip There is a much greater variety in Sunday strip formats. Sunday strips are usually in color, published in a special newspaper section, the Sunday comics section. Comics sections usually come in one of two sizes, full page or tabloid. A few newspapers ran their comics in a comic-book size section from the mid-to-late 1970s to the mid-1980s (billed as \\"collectable comics\\"), and some strips have appeared in the Sunday magazine of newspapers, such as the 1990 Dick Tracy reprints in the Daily News Magazine of the New York Daily News. =Variation= A single comic strip may appear in numerous variations; there is a \\"full\\" version, to appear at a given size, which may have parts eliminated, be shrunk, or have the panels cut up and re-arranged. Expendable parts may include a topper (a small separate comic strip, no longer used in mainstream comics), \\"throwaway\\" panels (a short throw-away gag, still common), or a large title panel or tier. Due to the desire to re-arrange, comics may use a conventional layout of the panels (as demonstrated below) to allow them to be cut up and displayed on a varied number of tiers. Full page Image:Comics full page.svg Full page is a format roughly 20 inches high and 14 inches wide. The Reading Eagle Sunday comics section is full-page size, though today no individual strips are still printed to take up a full page. When Sunday strips first appeared in newspapers, near the beginning of the 20th century, they were usually in the full-page size. Leading full-page Sundays included Thimble Theater, Little Orphan Annie, Dick Tracy and Bringing Up Father. Many full-page comic strips had a topper, a small strip that ran above or occasionally below the main strip, usually by the same artist. The topper on Thimble Theater was Sappo, the topper on Little Orphan Annie was Maw Green and ran at the bottom of the full page. Dick Tracy never had a topper while it was still a full page, but much later it had a topper, Sawdust, which ran at the bottom of the tabloid page.Holtz, Allan. Stripper's Guide Dictionary Part 1: Sunday Strips, August 14, 2007. In the 1940s, comic strips were reduced in size because newspapers wanted to cram in more comics per page. Paper rationing during World War II also contributed to this, but was not the primary cause. Many strips were reduced in size to half of a page or one-third of a page. Collectors call these formats \\"halfs\\" and \\"thirds\\". Only a few strips, notably Prince Valiant, were still published in full-page format after World War II. In the mid-1950s, there were a few attempts to revive the full-page Sunday comic strip, notably Lance and Johnny Reb and Billy Yank. These were an artistic but not a commercial success and were reduced to half- page format after a short full-page run. The last full-page Sunday strip was Prince Valiant, which continued in full-page format in some newspapers until 1970. New Prince Valiant stories still appear in newspapers today, but in half-page or smaller formats. Only a few books have been published reprinting full-page Sunday strips in their original size: The Golden Age of Tarzan, Prince Valiant: An American Epic and Little Nemo. = Two-thirds = A derivative of the full-page format, the 12-panel two-thirds format was used exclusively by the King Features Syndicate in some of its strips (e.g.: Popeye) after the war, being essentially a full without its \\"topper\\". The format was short-lived, as by 1957-58 these were barely printed in this format, being published as thirds instead. However these strips would be designed in a 12-panel format until about 1985‚Äì1986, as it was near impossible to run them as either halves or quarters. Half page Image:Comics half page.svg Half page is a Sunday strip format that is roughly 10 inches high and 14 inches wide. Today, it is the largest and most complete format for most Sunday strips, including Peanuts, Prince Valiant, and Doonesbury. The half- page Sunday strip was introduced in the 1920s to fit two Sunday strips on a single page. The Phantom, Mandrake the Magician and Terry and the Pirates were introduced in this format. Other strips, such as Flash Gordon and Blondie had panels rearranged, cropped or removed to make the full page fit in a smaller size. In the 1940s, most newspapers wanted more comics per page, so they often reduced the size. Beginning about this time, the half page became the standard size, and the third-of-a-page strip was introduced, fitting three strips on each page, one above another. A half page typically had three tiers; the third page either reduced, rearranged and cropped these panels, as seen in Li'l Abner strips, or more commonly, just dropped the top tier, as was the case with Peanuts. Most newspaper readers did not realize there were only seeing part of what the artist drew, and the artists were forced into increasingly restrictive formats to make dropping panels possible. Today, only the Reading Eagle and a few other newspapers run any of their Sunday strips in the complete half-page format. The Sunday Calvin and Hobbes comic strip was so popular that the artist insisted that it fill half of a page, although many editors ran a shrunken version of the same strip. That strip has since ended, and today the only strip that requires the half-page format, though not necessarily the half-page size, is Opus. Third Third is used by comic strip collectors and dealers to describe one of the formats in which Sunday strips appear in American newspapers. One page of a full-color comics section can be divided horizontally into two, three or four parts. Comic strip collectors call strips that occupy one-third of a full page \\"thirds\\". From the mid-1940s until at least the 1980s, \\"thirds\\" were the most common comic strip format, and \\"thirds\\" are still common today. \\"Thirds\\" usually drop several panels, and these incomplete strips are not sought after by collectors as much as half-page or full-page strips. Most people who casually read the Sunday comics are not aware that they are missing several panels of a strip if their newspaper runs it as a \\"third\\". A few comic strips were designed to be run as \\"thirds\\", for example, Steve Canyon, the early Garfield and On Stage (except for the last few years of its run). These strips are complete in the third of a page format, and they are cropped and rearranged in the half-page, tab or full-page format. Other strips, such as The Amazing Spider-Man and the current Alley Oop are drawn in the third-of-a-page format and the half page is created by adding a title tier, which is either the same every week (in the case of Alley Oop), or comes in a small number of different varieties (in the case of Spider-Man and other strips based on Marvel Comics characters). Quarter Quarter is used by comic strip collectors and dealers to describe the format in which a full page is divided horizontally into four equal parts. Quarter pages are small, but often have all of the panels of a half-page, rearranged into two tiers instead of three. Some quarters drop one panel, some add a title panel to the left of the two tiers. Some newspapers crowd five or even six quarters into a single page. Other formats As newspapers print fewer and fewer pages in the Sunday comics section and continue reducing broadsheet size, a variety of other formats have been introduced over the years, including formats that divide the page into vertical and horizontal sections. To fit the format of the weekly Grit, Little Annie Rooney and other Sunday strips were given extreme vertical rearrangements, which have grown very common in recent years (example: the Sunday strip for Non Sequitur is now available only in a vertical near-page-long format). Tab A tab or tabloid comic strip is a strip published on a full page of a tabloid-size newspaper. Most cities without subways have newspapers that are roughly 20 inches high and 14 inches wide, while cities with subways usually have smaller newspapers, roughly 14 inches high and 10 inches wide, making them easier to read on crowded public transit conveyances. The smaller format is called \\"tabloid\\". In New York City, for example, The New York Times is a full- size newspaper while the New York Post is a tabloid. Many collectors of newspaper comic strips prefer the tabloid or \\"tab\\" size Sunday strip for such strips as Little Orphan Annie, Dick Tracy and Terry and the Pirates. Half tab Half tab is a comic strip format that fills half of a page in a tabloid newspaper Sunday comics section. Usually, though not always, it is the same as the half-page format, only smaller. As modern newspapers cram more and more strips onto one Sunday page, even full-sized newspapers often use the half-tab (and even the third- tab) format. More and more tabloid newspapers put three or more reduced thirds on a single tabloid page.

He won 12 of his 26 races and a developed a cult following amongst Sydney race fans. Bred and owned by Woodlands Stud, Holy Roller stood 18.1 hands compared to the average thoroughbred at around 16 hands. His career highlights included wins in the Bill Ritchie Handicap and the Crystal Mile. Holy Roller was born at Woodlands Stud Denman, New South Wales, where it took his dam over one hour to get him out. The foal arrived at 0240 and did not stand until 0320. Both dam and foal were exhausted and lay for almost an hour recovering. The foaling night watchman was a 6 ft young man, and when the foal finally stood, he reached the mid-chest level of the watchman. Comments at the time included: \\"VERY big foal, enormous knees, fetlocks, etc.\\" His dam, Secret Blessing, was an average size mare, about 16hands, but very wide and roomy. Most of her progeny had been fairly large - her daughters tended to be wide like her, such as Genuflect, but Immense was tall and wide but not as big as her half-brother Holy Roller. His sire Sanction is a fairly tall horse, 16.1h. Holy Roller was weaned off his dam in April 1993. He was always very easy to pick out amongst the weanlings in a paddock - he was taller than the Clydesdale foal that shared the paddock. Woodlands Stud does not sell its yearlings but races everything it breeds; Trevor Lobb (general manager) and their private trainer John Hawkes assess the youngsters in November and divide them into the appropriate groups for breaking-in. When John Hawkes saw Holy Roller the first time, he said, \\"He would look good pulling a cart.\\" The yearling was named for the evangelical preachers who used to roam the southern states of the USA (the Mississippi bible belt) commonly known as \\"holy rollers\\". He was left until the very last batch of yearlings for breaking-in and didn't go to Belmont Park (north east of Sydney) until May 1994. After the breaker rode him the first time, he said, \\"This huge lump knows where he is putting his feet and has tremendous balance.\\" Holy Roller was gelded at an early age to try to slow down his rapid growth pattern, but it didn't work. At breaking-in, Holy Roller measured 17 hands and weighed an estimated 660 kg. Each time he went out for a spell, on his return, he would be re-measured and always had increased in height. At the end of his racing career, he measured 18.1 hands. Holy Roller didn't start until he was a late 3 year old. He then won at Canterbury and Moonee Valley (both very tight-turning tracks). Holy Roller always had to race on the outside of the field to have the freedom to stretch out properly. If caught inside other horses, he would cramp up to avoid hitting the others. Jockeys who have ridden Holy Roller him say it was like riding in an old Cadillac, very smooth ride, tremendous suspension but when the stride lengthens in the straight, they get whiplash in their necks; they also refuse to dismount straight off his back but rather get down onto a handy rail if possible, then drop to the ground. Another problem during a race was that the jockey was often unable to see horses in front of Holy Roller's neck and head (hidden underneath), and would have to trust to the horse to get around and past the smaller horse safely. Jockey Larry Cassidy said often he would ask Holy Roller to go forward in a race but the horse would refuse, then move out sideways, and Larry would realise there had been a \\"normal size\\" horse in front of him but not visible from the saddle. Holy Roller created extra work for farriers. Standard steel shoes are about 8 inches in length but the Holy Roller needed 14 inches per hoof, meaning the farrier had to start with a straight steel bar. Upon his retirement, his owners - \\"Chicken Kings\\" Jack and Bob Ingham - donated Holy Roller to Rod Hoare (NSW State Equine Veterinary Officer) who was looking for a big horse to compete at dressage and eventing.

The California Rangers were also considered to be part of California's early state militia, the predecessor to the current California Army National Guard, with Love holding the rank of Captain within the state. Early life and career Love was born in Vermont and left home at an early age to become a sailor. He eventually ended up in Texas and allegedly joined the Texas Rangers. Love fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and was likely mustered into federal service with the U.S. Army with other Texas Rangers in order to fight in the war, following the annexation of the state in 1846. According to limited accounts, he served as a scout, an army express rider, and also led an exploration up the Rio Grande.Legendary Lawman Harry Love Accessed 2017 Nov 21.Secrest, William B., The Man from the Rio Grande, Arther H. Clark Co., Spokane, 2005  To California and the pursuit of Joaquin Murrieta  In 1850 during the California Gold Rush, Love came to California to seek his fortune but was unsuccessful in the mines. Instead, he became a Deputy Sheriff in Santa Barbara, California. Later in 1852, he also worked as a bounty hunter, hunting for three mounted men seen in the area, thought to be the killers of Allen B. Ruddle, an unarmed young man robbed while traveling in a wagon to Stockton. To earn the large reward for the capture of these men, put up by Ruddles family, Love and a partner, tracked the three riders to Rancho San Luis Gonzaga at the foot of Pacheco Pass then one of them with another man to Buenaventura in Santa Barbara County. There in June 1852, they captured the one of two men they had followed, Pedro Gonzalez, later found to be a member of Joaquin Murrieta's gang, who had been accused of murder. However, at the Cuesta del Conejo, Love killed Gonzalez when Gonzalez tried escaping custody during a water stop on the way to Los Angeles.On June 18, 1852, Love and his partner appeared before Justice of the Peace Joseph S. Mallard at Los Angeles. In a prepared affidavit they stated they were in the area \\"for the purpose of apprehending a couple of Sonorans who were charged with having committed murders and robberies in Mariposa County and for whom a large reward had been offered.\\" They had tracked two of the gang to a San Buenaventura roadhouse and, after a brief exchange of gunshots, had captured one of the suspects - thought to be Pedro Gonzales, a Murrieta gang member. The two possemen began the trek back to Los Angeles, herding their captive on foot while they rode.The Los Angeles Star reported what happened next as given in the affidavit: \\"The prisoner, being on foot, complained of fatigue and made several ineffectual attempts to escape. When about 8 miles this side of the river he complained of thirst and pointing to a ravine near at hand, told his conductor that there was plenty of water a little way up. Accordingly, Mr. Lull[Love] dismounted and proceeded with the man til they came to a small clump of bushes, when the prisoner darted forward into them and would have made his escape - Mr. L's botas and spurs preventing him from giving chase - but the latter, in endeavoring to knock him down with his pistol, accidently [sic] discharged it and shot him through the head, killing him instantly.\\" Quoted from the Los Angeles Star, June 19, 1852. \\"Prisoner Shot\\", quoted in Secrest, William B., The Man from the Rio Grande, Arther H. Clark Co., Spokane, 2005, p.97-98,98 n.1-2 (Love's name was corrected in the Star, June 26, 1852.)Reyes Feliz in his confession testified: \\"I belonged to the company of Joaquin Murieta and the late Pedro, who was killed by Americans in the \\"cuesta del conejo.\\" see Daily Alta California, Volume 3, Number 345, 15 December 1852, p.2, col.2 Later from the South. --- Execution of Reyes Feliz. --- Discovery of another Murder. --- Conviction of the Murderer. --- One hundred horses stolen. With his reputation from the war and this success under his belt, Love was named as the commander of the California Rangers. The unit was created on May 11, 1853 by Governor John Bigler specifically to capture or kill the \\"Five Joaquins\\" gang, who had been identified as being responsible for over 20 murders, and numerous robberies and horse thefts in California's Gold Country in just the early months of 1853. For two months, the Rangers rode through the region seeking information on Murrieta and the other Joaquins, all while apprehending various other criminals. However the Five Joaquins seemed to have vanished from the goldfields, so Love tried looking on the far side of the Diablo Range, and near San Juan Bautista he encountered and arrested Joaquin Murrieta's brother in law Jesus Feliz. Love promised Feliz he would be freed if he led Love and his Rangers to Joaquin Murrieta. On July 12 after writing a note to the Governor, Love made a deceptive march southward in the Salinas Valley to throw spies off their track, then at night backtracked and next day moved southeastward along the San Benito valley and into the Diablo Range to the Rancho Real de Los Aguilas. From there they followed La Vereda del Monte to a point overlooking the Arroyo de Cantua, the gang's hideout and headquarters on July 21. There they had gathered hundreds of stolen horses and unbroken mustangs and over 80 men who were getting the horses branded and ready to drive them to Sonora for sale. After dismissing Feliz, Love and the Rangers rode down into the valley of the Cantua. There they rode among these \\"meste√±eros\\" and picked out seven or eight horses with brands by which they recognized them as stolen, then told them that they would be returning to San Juan and rode back ten miles, intending to observe these men. On the 24th the Rangers returned to find the camp deserted, they then moved three miles down the valley and hid themselves until 2 AM when they saddled up and rode down the valley to the southeast.San Joaquin Republican, August 11, 1853, THE CAPTURE OF JOAQUIN, quoted entirely in Frank F. Latta, Joaquin Murrieta and His Horse Gangs, Bear State Books. Santa Cruz, California. 1980. On morning of July 25, 1853, Love and 20 of the Rangers encountered a small group of men south of Panoche Pass at the point where Arroyo de Cantua, emerged from the foothills, in Mariposa County, (in what is now Fresno County), about 100 miles (160 km) away from the Mother Lode and 88 miles (141 km) away from Monterey. A confrontation occurred and four of the men were killed, two captured and three escaped. It was claimed by the Rangers that one of the dead men was Murrieta and another Emanuel Garcia (who the Rangers dubbed \\"Three-Fingered Jack\\"), Murrieta's right-hand man.Three Fingered Jack was subsequently identified by the Rangers as Emanuel Garcia, in an extensive report of their activities that appeared in the San Joaquin Republican, in its August 11, 1853 issue: :\\"Emanuel Garcia or \\"Three Fingered Jack,\\" retreated on foot and fought desperately, having only one load in his pistol when he sunk to the ground and expired, the weapon even then being cocked, and his thumb on the trigger.\\" San Joaquin Republican, August 11, 1853, THE CAPTURE OF JOAQUIN, quoted entirely in Frank F. Latta, Joaquin Murrieta and His Horse Gangs, Bear State Books. Santa Cruz, California. 1980. The Rangers cut off the heads of both men as well as Garcia's hand as proof, sending them by fast riders ahead of the main force to Fort Miller. Murrieta's head and the hand were preserved in brandy, but Garcia's head, shot through with a bullet decayed too rapidly in the summer heat, forcing them to bury it at Fort Miller, near Millerton. The jars were displayed in Mariposa, Stockton and San Francisco and traveled throughout California, where spectators could, for $1, see the remains. Seventeen people, including a priest, signed affidavits identifying the remains as Murrieta's and Love and his Rangers received the reward money. However, a young woman claiming to be Murrieta's sister said she did not recognize the head and argued that it could not be his since it did not have a characteristic scar on it. Additionally, numerous sightings of Murrieta were reported after his reported death. Many people criticized Love for showing the remains in large cities far from the mining camps, where Joaquin might have been recognized. It has even been claimed that Love and his Rangers killed some innocent men and made up the story of the capture of Murrieta to claim the reward money. Doubts about Murrieta's capture followed Love for the rest of his life. The head and hand were eventually lost in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Later life Having accomplished its mission, the California Rangers were disbanded and Love purchased a large tract of land near Boulder Creek, California, in Santa Cruz County, along the creek that bears his name today. In 1854 he married his neighbor, the widow Mary Bennett. Mary had also lost a son, killed in a gunfight by a son of Isaac Graham, a pioneer of that area. Love's marriage to Mary Bennett was rough and she soon moved away to Santa Clara. They reconciled and separated several times until 1866, when she sued for divorce, but lost. However, by the following year, fires, floods, and squatters had destroyed Love's property, leaving him homeless and in debt. He moved to his wife's ranch and lived in a house that she had built for him. She never let him live with her, however, and he plotted to kill her bodyguard, who was ordered to keep him from seeing her. On June 29, 1868, Love showed up on the porch of his wife's house in Santa Clara, where he was not allowed. When Mary and the bodyguard arrived, a gunfight broke out and Love was shot in the arm. Doctors attempted to save his life by amputating his arm, but he still died.Langum, David J. 2014. Quite contrary: the litigious life of Mary Bennett Love, p.125-165.

He is mainly known for his landscapes and cityscapes (vedute), or views, mostly of Venice. He also created architectural paintings, which reveal his interest in stage design.Dario Succi. \\"Marieschi, Michele Giovanni.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

He probably trained either with Gaspare Diziani,Martineau and Robison, 466 or Canaletto,Wittkower; neither source mentions the other painter. or both. According to his biography in Pellegrino Antonio Orlandi's Abecedario Pittorico, published in Venice in 1753, he spent some time in Germany, where he may have worked as a stage designer. He returned to Venice by 1731, when he is recorded as a scene-painter, and in 1735 he worked on the \\"effects\\" for the funeral in Fano of Maria Clementina Sobieska, wife of the Old Pretender. Under the influence of Marco Ricci and Luca Carlevarijs and encouraged by the success of Canaletto in the genre, he started to create capricci and vedute. Between 1735 and 1741 he was registered in the Venetian Fraglia de' Pittori, or painters' guild. One of Marieschi's sponsors at his wedding in 1737 was Gaspare Diziani. Although he initially produced capricci (i.e. fantastic, imaginary landscapes), he later painted more topographically accurate vedute. One of his patrons was the noted collector Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, who bought twelve paintings between 1736‚Äì38, including two canvases for 50 and 55 gold sequins respectively. He drew on his scenery painting experience to \\"transform his urban views by using an exaggerated perspective that confers the novelty of a capricious invention even on scenes taken from life\\". Michael Levey contrasts Marieschi's style with Canaletto's, noting that Marieschi's use of paint is livelier and fresher. He had a considerable influence on Francesco Guardi.Wittkower, 501, 503; Martineau and Robison, 466 Rialto Bridge In 1741-42 Marieschi published a set of 21 prints of Venice, under the title of Magnificentiores Selectioresque Urbis Venetiarum Prospectus; the title page featured a portrait of Marieschi by Angelo Trevisani.

The council is unusual in the United Kingdom local government system in that its executive function is controlled by a directly elected mayor of Hackney, currently Philip Glanville of the Labour Party. Hackney comprises 19 wards, each electing three councillors. Following the May 2018 election, Hackney London Borough Council consists of 52 Labour Party councillors and 5 Conservative Party councillors. The council was created by the London Government Act 1963 whereby it replaced three local authorities: Hackney Metropolitan Borough Council, Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough Council and Stoke Newington Metropolitan Borough Council. History There have previously been a number of local authorities responsible for the Hackney area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the London Borough of Hackney on 1 April 1965. Hackney London Borough Council replaced Hackney Metropolitan Borough Council, Shoreditch Metropolitan Borough Council and Stoke Newington Metropolitan Borough Council. All three had been created in 1900; the ancient parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington were previously governed by vestries, but together were united as the Hackney District of the Metropolis from 1855 to 1894. Shoreditch was also an ancient parish and was governed by a vestry until becoming a metropolitan borough in 1900. It envisaged through the London Government Act 1963 that Hackney as a London local authority would share power with the Greater London Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \\"wide area\\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for \\"personal\\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Hackney London Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. Hackney became an education authority in 1990. Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a \\"most purpose\\" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions. Powers and functions The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation. Hackney has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. It is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. The council shares responsibility with the Greater London Authority for strategic policies including housing, planning and the environment. Finances Hackney London Borough Council is the billing authority for Council Tax, and collects a precepts on behalf of the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. Elections =Electoral arrangements= Wards were established for Hackney when it came into existence on 1 April 1965. The first elections of ward councillors took place in 1964.London Borough Council Elections (1964) These boundaries were also used for the 1968, 1971 and 1974 elections. For the 1978 elections the ward boundaries were revised.London Borough Council Elections (1978) These boundaries were then also used at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 elections.

The formulations of its ingredients have changed since its original publication in print, and so some modern bartenders have created new versions which attempt to more closely mimic the original taste. Origin The drink was invented and named by Ian Fleming in the 1953 James Bond novel Casino Royale. Fleming continues with Bond telling the barman, after taking a long sip, \\"Excellent ... but if you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it still better,\\" and then adds in an aside, \\"Mais n'enculons pas des mouches\\" (‚Äîa vulgar French expression meaning \\"let's not split hairs\\"). Leiter jokingly suggests Bond name his drink the Molotov Cocktail. Bond in the next chapter, \\"Pink Lights and Champagne\\", names it the Vesper. At the time of his first introduction to the beautiful Vesper Lynd, he asks her name in an interrogation indirecte, \\"I can't drink the health of your new frock without knowing your Christian name.\\" He receives her name then enquires more from her with a look. \\"I was born in the evening, on a very stormy evening...\\" The idea strikes Bond her name is perfect for his recently invented special Martini and tells her his search for a name is over if Vesper will permit him her name for it. A Vesper differs from Bond's usual cocktail of choice, the martini, in that it uses both gin and vodka, Kina Lillet instead of the usual dry vermouth, and a lemon peel instead of an olive. Although there is a lot of discussion on the Vesper, it is only ordered by Bond once throughout Fleming's novels ‚Äì although Bond drinks the Vesper in the film Casino Royale ‚Äì and by later books Bond is ordering regular vodka martinis, though he also drinks regular gin martinis. Felix Leiter ordered a Vesper for Bond in the novel Diamonds Are Forever, albeit with Cresta Blanca in place of Kina Lillet, which Bond politely remarks is the \\"Best Vermouth I ever tasted.\\" It may be that Fleming decided not to have Bond order a Vesper again due to the way in which Casino Royale ends. In actuality, the book version of the Vesper was created by Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce. In Bryce's copy of Casino Royale Fleming inscribed \\"For Ivar, who mixed the first Vesper and said the good word.\\" In his book You Only Live Once, Bryce details that Fleming was first served a Vesper, a drink of a frozen rum concoction with fruit and herbs, at evening drinks by the butler of an elderly couple in Jamaica, the Duncans, the butler commenting, \\"'Vespers' are served.\\" Vespers or evensong is the sixth of the seven canonical hours of the divine office and are observed at sunset, the 'violet hour', Bond's later chosen hour of fame for his martini Vesper. However, the cocktail has been misrecorded after mishearing the name in several instances, resulting in its being alternatively named 'Vespa'. Contemporary versions Since Kina Lillet was discontinued in 1986 and the proof of Gordon's Gin was cut in 1992, the original recipe can no longer be made exactly. Substitutes can be made that attempt to recapture the original flavour of the drink: *Lillet Blanc is still available, but Kina Lillet additionally included quinine (hence its name). Cocchi Americano can be used as a substitute to recreate the original recipe, which has a more bitter finish than using Lillet Blanc.Serious Eats, The Vesper Cocktail Recipe * For a more traditional flavour, 50% (100-proof) vodka is used to bring the alcohol content of the vodka back to 1953 levels, with grain vodka being preferred. * Tanqueray, Bombay Sapphire, American Beefeater, or Broker's gin provides the traditional flavour of 47% (94 proof) gin, whereas Gordon's Gin, in the UK domestic market, has been cut to 37.5% (75 proof); in spite of this, a 47.3% (94.6 proof) export version of Gordon's Gin still exists today. (The extra dilution caused by shaking is the reason to prefer it over stirring in this high-alcohol drink.) Esquire printed the following update of the recipe in 2006: > Shake (if you must) with plenty of cracked ice. 3 oz Tanqueray gin, 1 oz > 100-proof [50%] Stolichnaya vodka, oz Lillet Blanc, teaspoon (or less) > quinine powder or, in desperation, 2 dashes of bitters. Strain into a > chilled cocktail glass and twist a large swatch of thin-cut lemon peel over > the top.

It is a London borough council, one of 32 in the United Kingdom capital of London. The council is unusual in that its executive function is controlled by a directly elected mayor of Newham, currently Rokhsana Fiaz. Newham is divided into 20 wards, each electing three councillors. As at August 2020, 59 councillors represent the Labour Party, and one seat (in East Ham Central ward) is vacant. The council was created by the London Government Act 1963 and replaced three local authorities: East Ham Borough Council, West Ham Borough Council and Woolwich Metropolitan Borough Council. History A map showing the wards of Newham since 2002 There have previously been a number of local authorities responsible for the Newham area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the London Borough of Newham on 1 April 1965. Newham replaced East Ham Borough Council, West Ham Borough Council and part of Woolwich Metropolitan Borough Council (for North Woolwich). West Ham was a county borough (which meant that its council had the functions of both a county and a borough) from 1889 and East Ham gained that status in 1915. It was previously a non-county borough and between 1894 and 1904 it was governed by East Ham Urban District Council. Before 1900 North Woolwich was governed by the Vestry of the Parish of Woolwich. It was envisaged that in accordance with the London Government Act 1963 that Newham as a London local authority would share power with the Greater London Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \\"wide area\\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for \\"personal\\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. As an outer London borough council it has been an education authority since 1965. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Newham London Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a \\"most purpose\\" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions. Powers and functions The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation. Newham has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. It is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal.

It is a seat of the Zrenjanin municipality.  History  Present-day Zrenjanin (formerly known as Veliki Beƒçkerek / Nagybecskerek / Gro√übetschkerek / Becicherecul Mare) was a seat of Torontaliensis county from 1779. A great fire in 1807 destroyed almost every building in the city, including old county building. Construction works for a new building started in 1816 and were finished in 1820 under project of architect Joseph Fischer. After 70 years, county building was re-constructed under projects of two renowned architects from Budapest, Gyula P√°rtos and √ñd√∂n Lechner. The county building was added by right and left wings, modernised facade in Neobaroque, new balcony, Zsolnay roof tile patterns and several other things like electrical lightning and telephone line. At that time, it was the most modern building in southern part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Main stairs are decorated by three stained glasses, depicting personifications of \\"Justice\\", \\"Wisdom\\" and \\"Power\\". They were damaged during storm in the summer 2003, and repaired aftermath.  Today  Zrenjanin City Hall is today a seat of Zrenjanin municipality authorities and Central Banat District. It is one of the most recognisable symbols of Zrenjanin, depicted on many postcards for 100 years.  City park  In the building's backyard there is a city park - created in 1887 after re-construction of the City Hall. It is decorated by fountain with a stork, many sculptures and mural depicting old Beƒçkerek fortress. It is opened for public during summer.

Cheat Engine is mostly used for cheating in computer games and is sometimes modified and recompiled to evade detection. The program resembles L. Spiro's Memory Hacking Software, TSearch, and ArtMoney. It searches for values input by the user with a wide variety of options that allow the user to find and sort through the computer's memory. Cheat Engine can also create standalone trainers that can operate independently of Cheat Engine, often found on user forums or at the request of another user. Features Cheat Engine can view the disassembled memory of a process and allow the addition and/or alteration of game states to give the user advantages such as infinite health, time, or ammunition. It also has some Direct3D manipulation tools, allowing vision through walls \\"Wallhacking\\" and zooming in/out \\"FOV changes\\", and with some advanced configuration, Cheat Engine can move the mouse to get a certain texture into the center of the screen. This is commonly used to create aimbots. However, the main use for Cheat Engine is in single player aspect of games, and its use in multiplayer games is discouraged. Cheat Engine can inject code into other processes, and as such, most antivirus programs mistake it for a virus. There are versions that avoid this false identification at the cost of many features (those which rely upon code injection). The most common reason for these false identifications is that Cheat Engine makes use of some techniques also used in Trojan rootkits to gain access to parts of the system and therefore gets flagged as suspicious, especially if heuristic scanning is enabled in the antivirus program's settings. Newer versions of Cheat Engine are less likely to be blocked by antivirus programs, so features like code injection can be used without problems. As of version 6.1, Cheat Engine can produce game trainers from the tables. While trainers generated in this way are typically very large for their intended purpose, generally used for testing purposes, some have been released by trainers groups as \\"final\\" versions, and even some popular sites are fully based on CE trainers due to the ease of trainer creation with CE. However, despite their popularity, CE trainer maker has not been updated since its implementation in version 6.1‚Äîit is largely unsupported, and emphasis is given on using Lua to generate trainers. Even the trainer maker itself uses Lua scripts to generate trainers. Implementations Two branches of Cheat Engine exist, Cheat Engine Delphi and Cheat Engine Lazarus. Cheat Engine Delphi is primarily for 32-bit versions of Windows XP. Cheat Engine Lazarus is designed for 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows 7. Cheat Engine is, with the exception of the kernel module, written in Object Pascal. Cheat Engine exposes an interface to its device driver with \`dbk32.dll\`, a wrapper that handles both loading and initializing the Cheat Engine driver and calling alternative Windows kernel functions. Due to a programming bug in Lazarus pertaining to the use of try and except blocks, Cheat Engine Lazarus had to remove the use of \`dbk32.dll\` and incorporate the driver functions in the main executable. The kernel module, while not essential to normal CE use, can be used to set hardware breakpoints and bypass hooked API in Ring 3, even some in Ring 0. The module is compiled with the Windows Driver development kit and is written in C. Cheat Engine also has a plugin architecture for those who do not wish to share their source code with the community. They are more commonly used for game specific features, as Cheat Engine's stated intent is to be a generic cheating tool. These plugins can be found in several locations on the Cheat Engine website as well as other gaming sites. Cheat Engine Lazarus has the ability to load its unsigned 64-bit device driver on Windows Vista and later x64 bit versions of Windows, by using DBVM, a virtual machine by the same developers that allows access to kernel space from user mode. It is used to allocate nonpaged memory in kernel mode, manually loading the executable image, and creating a system thread at \`Driver Entry\`. However, since the Driver Entry parameters are not actually valid, the driver must be modified for DBVM. Cheat Tables Cheat Engine allows its users to share their addresses and code locations with other users of the community by making use of cheat tables. \\"Cheat Tables\\" is a file format used by Cheat Engine to store data such as cheat addresses, scripts including Lua scripts and code locations, usually carrying the file extension .CT. Using a Cheat Table is straightforward and involves simply opening the Cheat Table through Cheat Engine and enabling/ticking the cheats stored within it. The ability to save and share Cheat Tables has resulted in a large online community for sharing cheats through the Cheat Engine Forums. Popular Cheat Tables are hosted on the Fearless Revolution website. In addition to simple memory addresses, cheat tables can extend the functionality of Cheat Engine using the Lua scripting language. Almost all of Cheat Engine's features are scriptable, and it is even possible to design custom dialogs to interact with scripts. Controversy In 2017, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) sent a copyright infringement notice asking Dark Byte to cease and desist. The notice claimed Cheat Engine allowed evading anti-cheat technologies, accessing in-game DLC items/microtransaction items that could only be bought with real money. Dark Byte responded by shutting down the cheat tables section to the public, asking them to be hosted off-site and coming to an agreement with ESA. The Cheat Engine community was not happy with the steps taken, and prominent members moved to a new community website called Fearless Revolution where old cheat tables have been uploaded and new ones are being posted. The Cheat Engine website and forums only focus on development of the tool itself now, and cheat tables have moved to Fearless Revolution forums.

Bees collect pollen from flowers to feed their young. Wasps and flies do not do this, although they may be seen eating pollen, so identification is not always easy.  Sting or no sting, solitary vs social  Eleven of the species, the social native bees, are in two genera, Tetragonula and Austroplebeia, and have no sting. Of the remainder, which live solitary lives, none are aggressive, and most cannot actually use their sting on humans because they are too small to do so. Larger examples of Australian native bee are capable of stinging if handled or squashed. The stings of most Australian native species of bee will cause relatively minor discomfort to most people -- \\"not as painful as those of a bull ant or paper wasp and last only a few minutes\\". However, they may sting more than once, and can cause an allergic reaction‚Äîincreasing effect associated with repeated exposure to the antigen.  Honey  None of the native species of bee in Australia are true honey bees, which are native to Europe, Asia and Africa. Social species of native bees do produce honey, but not much, as they are relatively primitive bee species. In cool-climate areas of Australia, all the honey the bees produce is needed by the swarm to live through winter. Collecting honey from Australian native bee nests can cause many of the bees to drown in spilt honey. The honey is tangy in comparison with commercial honey taken from the European honey bee. The bees store their honey in \\"small resinous pots which look like bunches of grapes\\".  Pollination  The different species of Australian native bee have different habits and preferences in gathering pollen, so different species are better pollinators of a given plant than other species. Research is currently underway into use of Amegilla (\\"blue-banded bees\\") for use in pollinating hydroponic tomatoes, while some hydroponic growers are petitioning for introduction to the Australian mainland of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris‚Äîthe island continent Australia has a history of sensationally poor outcomes from introduced species, the most famous example being that of the cane toad Bufo marinus‚Äîso the question of use of native vs introduced bees for pollination in Australia is controversial.  Western Australian native bees  Approximately 800 species of native bee occur in Western Australia, and many of them are endemic. Like all bees, native Australian bees are a type of specialised wasp that has evolved to vegetarianism. They feed on nectar, but it is the female native Australian bee that will thicken the nectar to make honey before taking it back to the nest. Australian bees are mostly solitary insects. A female bee will build a nest with the aid of \\"workers\\". Native Australian bees face many threats, particularly from parasitic insects such as some wasps, flies and beetles.

Justo Avenue. Originally a stream draining into the R√≠o de la Plata, its length goes through 10 of the 47 barrios of the city: Versalles, Liniers, Villa Luro, V√©lez Sarsfield, Floresta, Villa Santa Rita, Villa Mitre, Caballito, Villa Crespo, and Palermo. The stream was one of the natural limits of the city, before the Belgrano and Flores neighborhoods were incorporated. It is named after the legend of La Maldonado, a woman that arrived with Pedro de Mendoza in 1536, and was abandoned in the plain, on the margins of the stream. The stream became a garbage dump in time, and during the rainy season became a polluted waterway made dangerous because of its overflows. The authorities decided via a municipal ordinance on August 25, 1924, to tube the stream as a final solution to all the problems that caused in a growing city, and in 1928 excavations started. The Maldonado drainage system, one of the most significant public works ever built in Buenos Aires, was designed as a part of a broader drainage system in the city; it was commissioned and designed by the state-owned Obras Sanitarias de la Naci√≥n and engineered by German firm Siemens-Schuckert. The excavation phase required hundreds of workers and machinery. The second phase, begun in 1929, consisted of rising columns to support a gigantic slab, for which 5000 tons of rebar, 20000 tons of cement, 55000 tons of sand, and 70000 tons of gravel were used. Following these tubing and drainage works completed in 1933, a large packed soil road was erected over the stream in 1934. This road was re-inaugurated on July 9, 1937, as Juan B. Justo Avenue. Persistent seasonal flooding along the northwest stretch of the former Maldonado Stream caused by drainage overflow (which affected up to 266,000 people yearly) prompted Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra in 2005 to announce complementary drain works. Ghella, a local contractor, presented the winning bid in 2007, and work began on the alleviating tunnels the following year. The first of the two new tunnels was completed in 2011, and measured in length. Work on the second, larger tunnel began in 2010 and was completed in 2012; it measured in length, required 200,000 cubic meters (7 million cubic feet) of cement, and cost USD200 million.

In 1676, in the course of Bacon's Rebellion, the tribe was attacked by militias from the Colony of Virginia and decimated. Also under demographic pressure from European settlements and newly introduced infectious diseases, the Saponi and Tutelo came to live near the Occaneechi on adjacent islands. By 1714 the Occaneechi moved to join the Tutelo, Saponi, and other Siouan people living on a reservation in current-day Brunswick County, Virginia. It included a fort called Christanna. The Siouan people had been drastically reduced to approximately 600 people. Fort Christanna was closed in 1717, after which there are few written references to the Occaneechi. Colonists recorded that they left the area in 1740 and migrated north for protection with the Iroquois. During the 19th and 20th centuries, some remnant Siouan peoples gathered together and worked to retain their identity as Native Americans. In the late 20th century, they organized as the self-named Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation. In 2002 the tribe was formally recognized by the state of North Carolina. The members of the tribe live primarily in Alamance and Orange Counties.Lerch 333 Name The meaning and origin of the name Occaneechi is unknown. They have also historically been called the Achonechy, Aconechos, Akenatzy, Akenatzy's, Hockinechy, Occaneches, Occaanechy, Occhonechee, Occonacheans, Occoneechee, Ockanechees, Ockanigee, Okenechee, Acconeechy, Occaneeches, Ochineeches, and Ockinagee.Demallie 298 History =17th century= The Occaneechi were first written about in 1650, by English explorer Edward Bland.Demallie 291 He wrote that they lived on the Trading Path that connected Virginia with the interior of North America. Their position on the Trading Path gave the Occaneechi the power to act as trading \\"middlemen\\" between Virginia and various tribes to the west. In 1673, Abraham Wood, a Virginian fur trader, sent James Needham and Gabriel Arthur into the southern Appalachian Mountains in an attempt to make direct contact with the Cherokee, thus bypassing the Occaneechi. The party did make contact with the Cherokee. It was not until the last decades of the 17th century, when South Carolina colonists established a strong relationship with the Cherokee and other interior tribes, that the Occaneechi role as trading middleman was undermined. In May 1676, the Occaneechi allied with Nathaniel Bacon and his British troops in a war with the Susquehannock; however, the British immediately turned on their allies and attacked three forts within the Occaneechi village. The British killed the Occaneechi's leader Posseclay, approximately one hundred men, as well as many women and children. A Susquehannock war party attacked Occoneechee Island in the summer of 1678.Demallie 292 =18th century= In 1701 John Lawson visited the Occaneechi village, located on the Eno River near present-day Hillsborough, North Carolina. His written report plus modern archaeological research at the site give insight into a society undergoing rapid change. They also were working to continue traditional crafts and a way of life. Historian Robert Beverley, Jr., in his History and Present State of Virginia (1705), wrote that the Occaneechi language was widely used as a lingua franca, \\"understood by the chief men of many nations, as Latin is in many parts of Europe\\" -- even though, he says, the Occaneechi \\"have been but a small nation, ever since those parts were known to the English.\\" Beverley said that the \\"priests and conjurers\\" of the other Virginia Indian tribes \\"perform their adorations and conjurations\\" in this general language, much \\"as the Catholics of all nations do their Mass in the Latin.\\" Linguistic scholars believe that the Occaneechi spoke a dialect of the Siouan language Tutelo. Virginia governor Alexander Spotswood mentioned the Occaneechi as being one of nine Native nations within Virginia in 1712.Demallie 293 Along with the \\"Stuckanok, Tottero, and Saponi,\\" the Occaneechi signed a \\"Treaty of Peace\\" with the colony of Virginia in 1713. They moved to Fort Christanna in southeast Virginia. Occaneechi Town was almost entirely abandoned by 1713. Fort Christanna was operated by the Virginia Company from 1714 to 1717. Its closure was apparently due to a lack of profits as an Indian trading center. Although several distinct groups of Siouan Indians lived at Fort Christanna, the English Virginians tended to refer to them simply as \\"Saponi\\" or \\"Fort Christanna Indians.\\" After the closing of Fort Christanna in 1717, colonial records contain few references to the Occaneechi. Those references that do exist indicate a continued trade between Virginia colonists and the Saponi and Occaneechi. By 1720, after ongoing losses from warfare, the remnant bands of the Occaneechi, Saponi, and Stukanox, \\"who not finding themselves Separately Numerous, enough for their Defence, have agreed to unite in one Body, and all of them now go under the Name of the Sapponeys, as William Byrd II wrote.Demallie 295 In 1727, a settler living near the Iroquoian Meherrin, in a region where some violence had broken out, wrote to the governor of Virginia about the events. He said the Meherrin denied attacking the Nottoway (another Iroquoian tribe). \\"[T]hey lay the whole blame upon the Occaneechy King and the Saponi Indians.\\" This suggests that English settlers recognized a distinction between the Occaneechi and Saponi. In 1730 Virginia's House of Burgesses records noted an \\"Interpreter to the Saponi and Occaneechi Indians.\\" This implied the existence of monoglot Occaneechi people. In 1730, many Saponi moved to live among the Catawba in South Carolina, but most returned to Virginia in 1733, along with some Cheraw Indians. After 1733 the Saponi appear to have fragmented into small groups and dispersed. Some apparently remained in the vicinity of Fort Christanna, which was noted in Virginia records by its Saponi name, Junkatapurse. After 1742 the settlement is no longer mentioned, but only a road called Junkatapurse. In the 1740s, the Saponi migrated south to live with the Catawba. Governor Gooch of Virginia reported that the \\"Saponies and other petty nations associated with them ... are retired out of Virginia to the Cattawbas\\" during the years 1743-1747. Most of the remaining Saponi members were recorded as migrating north in 1740 for protection with the Iroquois. They mostly disappeared from the historical record in the Southeast. After the American Revolution, in which four of the Iroquois Six Nations had sided with the losing British, the majority of the Iroquois (and Saponi) went to Canada for resettlement. Descendants live mostly at the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation reserve in Ontario. Traditional English-American histories typically describe the Saponi group of Indians as having left Virginia and North Carolina in the 18th century, either to join the Catawba or the Iroquois. Starting in the middle of the 18th century, however, historic records note Saponi living in North Carolina. Some Saponi moved from Virginia to various places in North Carolina. There is some evidence that isolated Indians never left these areas of North Carolina and became consolidated with Saponi from Virginia. In 1756, Moravian settlers living near present-day Winston-Salem reported an Indian palisaded \\"fort\\" settlement near the Haw River. The Moravians called the Indians \\"Cherokees\\", but it is more likely they were Sissipahau (\\"Saxapahaw\\") or another group related to the Occaneechi. This, along with various oral traditions, indicates Indians' living in a more or less traditional manner in North Carolina's Piedmont after such settlements supposedly vanished. In 1763, Lt. Governor Francis Fauquier of Virginia wrote a letter that included a description of the Indians of Virginia: \\"There are some of the Nottoways, Meherrins, Tuscaroras, and Saponys, who tho' they live in peace in the midst of us, lead in great measure the lives of wild Indians.\\" He contrasted these Indians with the Eastern Shore and Pamunkey Indians, whom he described as more assimilated to English ways. Thus, there are still indications of Saponi in Virginia during this period. Archaeology For years lay people and researchers have discovered thousands of artifacts from \\"Occoneechee Town,\\" \\"Saponi Town\\" and \\"Tutelo Town\\" on islands in the Roanoke River near Clarksville, Virginia. Prior to the flooding of the islands in 1952, this was one of the richest archeology sites on the East Coast. Since 1983 the Research Laboratories of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have been uncovering another \\"Occaneechi Town\\", a late 17th and early 18th century Occaneechi village on the Eno River near present- day Hillsborough, North Carolina. Recent history In 1995, a community centered around Pleasant Grove, North Carolina descended from the Fort Christanna confederation of Occannechi, Saponi, and Tutelo began hosting an annual powwow and organized under the name Occaneechi Band of Saponi. They are recognized by the state of North Carolina and primarily reside in Alamance County.Lerch 328 The contemporary Occaneechi and Haliwa-Saponi tribes are mostly descendants of American Indian people who lived on the frontier of Virginia and North Carolina as early as the mid-to late 18th century. They migrated and acquired land as did European or English neighbors. They lived in close-knit communities, and in the middle-to-late 20th century the North Carolina and Virginia Piedmont Indian descendants officially reclaimed historical names such as Saponi and Occaneechi. The Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation, now numbering 700, are the eighth and smallest tribe officially recognized by the state of North Carolina, receiving official status in 2002. The tribe presently owns of land in NE Alamance County, North Carolina, where it is developing a tribal center.

Production Seinfeld was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment and distributed by Columbia Pictures Television and Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television) and aired on NBC in the US. The executive producers were Jerry Seinfeld, George Shapiro, and Howard West with Tom Gammill and Max Pross as supervising producers. Bruce Kirschbaum was the executive consultant. This season was directed by Andy Ackerman. The series was set predominantly in an apartment block on New York City's Upper West Side; however, the eighth season was shot and mostly filmed in CBS Studio Center in Studio City, California. The show features Jerry Seinfeld as himself, and a host of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, which include George Costanza, Elaine Benes, and Cosmo Kramer, portrayed by Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Michael Richards, respectively. The departure of Larry David from the production and writing team led to Seinfeld himself taking almost complete creative control of the show. As a result, the show began to remove itself from the 'show about nothing' format it had begun life as, and took a far more absurdist, surreal stylistic turn. Regardless of the change, the show still stood at the top of the ratings for the entire season. It is also notable as being the first season where Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up routines are not present. Seinfeld cites that this is due to him being too busy writing episodes to create additional stand-up material. Due to Julia Louis-Dreyfus's off-screen pregnancy, her character had to spend the latter half of this season hiding her belly behind furniture and laundry baskets.

Maleic Anhydride is a commonly used raw material with diacid functionality. Polyester resins are used in sheet moulding compound, bulk moulding compound and the toner of laser printers. Wall panels fabricated from polyester resins reinforced with fiberglassso-called fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP)are typically used in restaurants, kitchens, restrooms and other areas that require washable low- maintenance walls. They are also used extensively in cured-in-place pipe applications. Departments of Transportation in the USA also specify them for use as overlays on roads and bridges. In this application they are known as PCO Polyester Concrete Overlays. These are usually based on isophthalic acid and cut with styrene at high levelsusually up to 50%. Polyesters are also used in anchor bolt adhesives though epoxy based materials are also used. Many companies have and continue to introduce styrene free systems mainly due to odor issues. Most polyester resins are viscous, pale coloured liquids consisting of a solution of a polyester in a monomer which is usually styrene..  Unsaturated polyester  Unsaturated polyesters are condensation polymers formed by the reaction of polyols (also known as polyhydric alcohols), organic compounds with multiple alcohol or hydroxy functional groups, with saturated or unsaturated dibasic acids. Typical polyols used are glycols such as ethylene glycol; acids used are phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and maleic acid. Water, a by-product of esterification reactions, is continuously removed, driving the reaction to completion. The use of unsaturated polyesters and additives such as styrene lowers the viscosity of the resin. The initially liquid resin is converted to a solid by cross-linking chains. This is done by creating free radicals at unsaturated bonds, which propagate in a chain reaction to other unsaturated bonds in adjacent molecules, linking them in the process. The initial free radicals are induced by adding a compound that easily decomposes into free radicals. This compound is usually and incorrectly known as the catalyst. Initiator is the more correct term. Cobalt salts are usually used as a true catalyst. Substances used are generally organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. Polyester resins are thermosetting and, as with other resins, cure exothermically. The use of excessive initiator especially with a catalyst present can, therefore, cause charring or even ignition during the curing process. Excessive catalyst may also cause the product to fracture or form a rubbery material. Biodegradation Lichens have been shown to deteriorate polyester resins, as can be seen in archaeological sites in the Roman city of Baelo Claudia Spain. Advantages Polyester resin offers the following advantages: # Adequate resistance to water and variety of chemicals. # Adequate resistance to weathering and ageing. # Low cost. # Polyesters can withstand a temperature up to 80 ¬∞C. # Polyesters have good wetting to glass fibres. # Relatively low shrinkage at between 4‚Äì8% during curing. # Linear thermal expansion ranges from 100‚Äì200 x 10‚àí6 K‚àí1. Disadvantages Polyester resin has the following disadvantages: # Strong styrene odor # More difficult to mix than other resins, such as a two-part epoxy # The toxic nature of its fumes, and especially of its catalyst, MEKP, pose a safety risk if proper protection isn't used # Not appropriate for bonding many substrates # The finished cure is most likely weaker than an equal amount of an epoxy resin See also * Polyester * Styrene * Thermoset polymer matrix * Thermosetting polymer References Category:Polyesters Category:Synthetic resins Category:Thermosetting plastics ","title":"Polyester resin"},{"id":"7997906","text":"Tower Court and Foleshill Road, Foleshill Foleshill is a suburb in the north of Coventry in the West Midlands of England. Longford, Courthouse Green and Rowley Green are to its north and Keresley is to its west. The population of the Ward at the 2011 census was 19,943.  History  Foleshill was originally a village and parish to the north of Coventry, it was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 along with Ansty as part of the estate formerly held by Lady Godiva. The meaning of the name is believed to be derived from 'hill of the folk or people'. Foleshill was originally part of Warwickshire, but became part of the County of the City of Coventry from 1451 to 1842, when it again became part of Warwickshire. From 1894 it was the seat of the Foleshill Rural District; when this was abolished in 1932, Foleshill was reincorporated into the City of Coventry. Development of industries within the area such as the Ordnance Works, J&J; Cash Ltd (silk ribbon weaving), and various brick works; was aided by the existence of the Coventry to Nuneaton railway, (upon which it had a railway station until 1965) and the Coventry Canal. In July 1905, Courtaulds Ltd opened its factory in Foleshill and grew to become a world leader in the production of artificial fibres, requiring a considerable expansion of the facility over the following years. The now-demolished Courtaulds chimney was reputed to be the tallest in England when it was erected in 1924. It stood 365 feet (111 m) tall, was built on 15 feet (4.5 m) - deep foundations, had a base diameter of 26 feet (8 m) tapering to 16 feet (5 m) at the top, and consisted of 917,000 bricks weighing a total of 4,000 tons (4,064 metric tons). Tower Court, formerly one of the Courtaulds buildings, is now used as offices. Jaguar Cars had a factory in the area in the 1930s and 1940s. Riley Cars were based in Foleshill from 1916 to 1948, when production was moved to the MG factory in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Challenge, an early cycle and car manufacturer, moved into new premises which included an impressive red-brick office building, which can still be seen on Foleshill Road. The original Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital was built in the mid-1860s in the gothic style and accommodating just 60 beds, which at the time was sufficient for Coventry's requirements. The hospital was extended to cope with the increasing needs of the developing city, and what remained of the original building was destroyed by Luftwaffe bombing during World War II. The most troubled section of Foleshill is arguably the Pridmore council estate, which has a history of crime including widespread arson and vandalism. In October 2000, plans were unveiled to demolish more than 130 homes in the area. However, when plans for new houses on the site were unveiled in July 2002, it was announced that just 65 new properties would be built there, along with a community centre, shops and a public park. By May 2005, the rehousing was almost complete, and a new housing development has since been completed in the place of the old properties. The area gained notoriety across the region when on the evening of 29 January 1999 a 22-year-old man, Richard Waring, was fatally shot during a brawl outside the Crow and the Oak public house. In February 2000, local drug dealer Andrew Henson was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter in connection with the shooting and received an eight- year prison sentence. Two other men were cleared. Filmmaker Michael Moore was proclaimed \\"Lord Moore of Foleshill\\" for $8,000 paid with an American Express card as part of a bit in episode 4 of TV Nation. Demography In the post- WW2 period the area acquired a large ethnic minority population. It is now the only one of the 18 wards in Coventry where non-whites form a majority of the population. At the 2011 census, 50.1% of the population were Asian, 30.8% were White, 11% were Black, 3.5% were Mixed. 1.7% were Arab, and 3% belonged to another ethnic group.

It includes 18 species. Distribution The genus Malapterurus is found throughout western and central tropical Africa and the Nile River. They occur in all major freshwater systems including the Buzi, Niger, Ogoou√©, Omo, Sanaga, Sabi-Lundi, Senegal, Shari, Congo, and Zambezi River basins, as well as Lakes Albert, Chad, Kainji, Tanganyika, and Turkana. Description Malapterurus have an elongate and cylindrical body that gives them the general appearance of a sausage. The eyes are small, the lips are rather thick, and the snout is rounded with widely separated nostrils. The gill openings are narrow and restricted to the sides. Malapterurus species have three pairs of barbels, and lack a dorsal fin. The pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins are rounded. The swimbladder has two elongate posterior chambers. Species in Malapterurus are generally grayish-brown on the back and sides, fading to an off white or cream color on the ventral surfaces of the head and body. There are irregular black spots or blotches randomly distributed on the sides of the body. The posterior half of the caudal peduncle usually has a dark brown or black vertical bar and a cream vertical bar immediately before it. The edges of the anal and caudal fins have a cream margin, and the base of the caudal fin has a cream region and a dark brown crescent-shaped band immediately after it. The electrogenic organ is derived from anterior body musculature and lines the body cavity. A fish that is 50 centimetres (19 in) in length can discharge up to 350 V. M. electricus is one of the few electric species that have been conditioned by means of reward to discharge on signal. As reported in the New York Times on April 2, 1967, researcher Dr. Frank J. Mandriota of City College of New York conditioned a M. electricus to discharge on a light signal for a reward of live worms delivered automatically. This is a first in conditioning that modified neither glandular nor muscular responses. M. electricus can grow as large as 122 centimetres (48 in) TL and . Ecology Malapterurus species are generally found among rocks or roots in turbid or black waters with low visibility. They favor sluggish or standing water. M. electricus is a voracious piscivore. It uses its electrical discharges to stun prey. It is an opportunistic feeder and will feed on any readily available prey in the habitat. These fish are slow-moving, deliberate feeders with infrequent, heavy meals. Breeding pairs of M. electricus nest in holes about 3 metres (10 ft) in length excavated in clay banks in water deep. Relationship to humans The electrical discharge of M. electricus is not known to be fatal to humans. M. electricus is eaten as food in certain parts of Africa. Along the shores of Lake Kainji, smoked electric catfish is a popular delicacy. M. electricus is also sometimes encountered as an aquarium fish.

Typical applications include demanding electrical applications, corrosion resistant needs, appliance, automotive, and transit.  Manufacturing  BMC is manufactured by mixing strands (Greater than 1/8‚Äù and less than 2\\") of chopped glass fibers, styrene, an initiator, and filler in a mixer with an unsaturated thermoset resin (commonly polyester resin, vinyl ester resin or epoxy resin). The mixing is done at room temperature and stored at low temperatures to slow down curing prior to molding. The concentration of the mixture can vary depending on application, but is typically 30% glass fibers, 25% filler, and 45% resin, styrene, and initiator. The material is provided in bulk or in logs approximately 4\\" in diameter. The glass fibers in BMC increase the strength properties of the product to be higher than standard thermoplastic products. The viscosity of BMC dictates how effectively it can fill a mold. When at high viscosity, the pressure applied to the BMC is not enough for it to flow, and when at low viscosity, the fibers will stay in one place while the rest of the material flows without them. The viscosity constrains the amount of each component that can be used when mixing BMC. Having a large amount of fibers or longer fibers improves mechanical properties but makes the BMC more viscous. Adding fillers can lower the cost of the BMC or improve a certain property, but causes the BMC to become more viscous. Adding more styrene lowers viscosity but causes the moulded BMC to become brittle. When at an optimal viscosity to allow flow, components made using BMC can be up to 16\\" in their longest dimension before the components of the mixture begin to separate.

Tuart forest was common on the Swan coastal plain, until the valuable trees were felled for export and displaced by the urban development around Perth, Western Australia. The wood is dense, hard, water resistant and resists splintering, and found many uses when it was available. Remnants of tuart forest occur in state reserves and parks, the tree has occasionally been introduced to other regions of Australia and overseas. Remaining trees are vulnerable to phytophthora dieback, an often fatal disorder, including a previously unknown species discovered during analysis of dead specimens.flower budsflowersfruit Description The tree is native to the southwest of Western Australia and typically grows to a height of . Taller trees are often found at the southern end of the trees range while smaller trees are found at the northern end. The crown of the tree can spread up to a width of . The habit of tuart is a tall single stemmed tree, but may form a low and multi-stemmed tree at the edge of stands in response to salinity and winds. Tuart has box-like rough bark over the length of the trunk and branches. The bark is fibrous and grey in colour and breaks into smaller flaky pieces. Leaves are stalked, alternate, with a lanceolate or falcate shape. The leaves are slightly discolorous to concolorous, glossy, light green and thin. The leaf blade is in length and often curved. White flowers appear in mid summer to mid autumn between January to April. Buds that are almost stalkless appear as clusters in groups of seven. The buds have swollen caps, said to resemble a small ice cream cone, that are around long. The flowers are formed in tight clusters made up of around seven flowers. These later form into fruits with a mushroom shape containing small red-brown seeds. The fruits are narrow and in length with a broad rim.  Taxonomy and naming  The species was formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, published in the third volume of his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis (1828). The type collection was assembled by the botanist Jean- Baptiste Leschenault at the Vasse River during 1802, while serving with the Baudin expedition. In 1939, William Blakely and Henry Steedman described two varieties of this species in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium but the named are listed as synonyms by the Australian Plant Census. The epithet gomphocephala is derived from gomphos, meaning 'club' and kephale, 'head',Ruthrof, K. X., Yates, C. J., & Loneragan, W. A. (2002). The biology of tuart. In: B. J. Keighhery, V. M. Longman, & W. A. Nedlands (Eds.), Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) and Tuart Communities (pp. 108‚Äì122). A Perth Branch Wildflower Society of Western Australia. describing the rounded and overlapping shape of the operculum. The species is allied as a monophyletic arrangement within the most diverse eucalypt subgenus, Eucalyptus subgen. Symphyomyrtus, recognised as the sole species of it section. The Noongar peoples named the tree tuart or tooart, moorun or mouarn. Distribution Lake Clifton, 2007 The distribution range of the species is a narrow coastal corridor within the Swan Coastal Plain, extending inland , a continuous strip south from Yanchep to Busselton. This area has been intensively cleared for changes in agricultural practices, then urbanisation, so that the numbers of tuart trees and forest was greatly reduced after the establishment of the Swan River Colony. Outlying patches of the tree are found to the north of Yanchep as far as Geraldton and further inland where rivers intersect the range. The species has become naturalised in other places. It grows in sandy well drained soils, often over limestone, in sunny positions. The trees are part of coastal shrubland ecosystems in areas of deep sand. They also will often be part of limited woodland communities in protected areas along the coast. When it occurs in woodland or open forest it is often associated with peppermint trees (Agonis flexuosa) in the understorey. Uses As a durable hardwood the timber is sought after for scantlings, structural timber, the construction of railway carriages, and boat building. The colouring and grain pattern of the timber also makes it a popular choice for furniture manufactures. Due to over- logging the tuart is a protected tree with conditions placed on felling. The heartwood is a pale yellow-brown colour with a fine texture and a highly interlocked grain, close and twisted, almost curled back. The green wood has a density of and an air-dried density of . The flowers are an excellent source for the production of honey. The colour of the product is described as light and creamy and it candies quickly to become hard and dry if properly matured in the hive. The quality of the source was noted as very high in 1939, although it was determined to be an 'undependable source' thirty years later.  Ecology  The tree is moderately tolerant of saline soil and salt-laden winds. It is also drought and frost tolerant. Individual trees may live over four hundred years. Ludlow forest Experimental cultivation in the 1930s of the species identified that it was able to grow in areas of low rainfall, as little as thirteen inches per annum. They were introduced to France and grown extensively there by the end of the nineteenth century, The biodiversity of tuart forest is rich, containing unique assemblages of plants, fungi and animals. A 2009 survey of endophytic fungi on woody species at two tuart woodlands, sampling acacia Acacia cochlearis, A. rostellifera, the sheoak Allocasuarina fraseriana, peppermint Agonis flexuosa, Banksia grandis, sandalwood Santalum acuminatum, and eucalypts jarrah Eucalyptus marginata and tuart, found around three quarters of isolates were taxa of the family Botryosphaeriaceae, eighty percent of which was the species Neofusicoccum australe. Four new taxa, Dothiorella moneti, Dothiorella santali, Neofusicoccum pennatisporum, and Aplosporella yalgorensis, resulted from the analysis of the survey. The species Botryosphaeria dothidea was also isolated from acacia and jarrah samples. Tuart gives its name to a description of an ecological community, as the dominant species of the canopy at Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) woodlands and forests of the Swan Coastal Plain (Tuart woodlands and forests). The area where these occur is noted as a greatly reduced, and those remaining are fragmented populations of variable quality. A proposal submitted in 2017 recommended these be listed as critically endangered in the nation's register of threatened ecological communities. Tuart may also occur in the threatened community Banksia woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain. The species is vulnerable to dieback, associated with fungal species of the genus Phytophthora. A study in 2007 of infected or deceased tuart trees and woodland identified isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi, already implicated in the decline of tuart, and that of organisms‚Äîpreviously diagnosed as that of the Phytophthora citricola complex‚Äîwas identified as a new species Phytophthora multivora. Damage to reproductive process by a native predator was first noticed at the end of the nineteenth century. Larvae deposited in flowers by the tuart bud weevil Haplonyx tibialis (Curculionidae) feed on the tissue in the operculum, the female weevil having caused the budding flower to become partly or completely damaged after laying a single egg; the larvae eventually emerge by chewing through the base of the bud. Tuart forest persisted in situ through the last glacial maximum, and extended its range thirty kilometres to the west as the coastline became exposed by lower sea levels. The historical phylogeography of the tuart forest indicates the moderating influence of the marine climate in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region during a period of aridification and other severe climate changes elsewhere on the continent.  Natural history  The extent and maturity of tuart forest and woodland was greatly reduced after colonisation. When Charles Fraser viewed them during a preliminary exploration toward Guildford he remarked on their 'stupendous' size. Drummond recorded specimens between nine and thirteen metres in circumference at a forest north of Busselton. Tuart in Lane-Poole's Primer of Forestry 1927 The timber from the colony's first sawmill, amongst tuart forest at Kings Park, was used by Henry Trigg for construction of the new government's infrastructure; Trigg describes the \\"Tewart\\" wood's desirable qualities, durable, yet workable, as similar to white gum [eucalypt] and the lignum vitae of the South American genus Guaiacum. The four ton cogwheels at the Old Mill, Perth were hewn from this wood. The utility of the timber was remarked on by George Fletcher Moore, the 1830s colonial diarist, the value to industries such as shipbuilding was derived from its resistance to splitting and splintering. The British Admiralty received loads of this timber at Portsmouth and Chatham during the 1850‚Äì60s, exported from Wonnerup and Bunbury, Western Australia, an inspection by Thomas Laslett also gave the most favourable possible assessment. A plan to export a tuart to the 1851 Great Exhibition was abandoned when an adequate saw could not be found. The timber was given additional value due to the proximity of the forests to ports at the coast. The land made available by the destruction of forests was recommended for the introduction of species at orchards, producing apples, grapes, pears, peaches and nectarines, by the state's Department of Agriculture in the 1890s. The timber produced in the state forest during the early twentieth century was used for railway carriages, greatly reducing costs by replacing steel with tuart and wandoo. The wood was only available in small quantities for private uses, notably stair treads and the favoured source for butcher's blocks. The species was surveyed in 1882 by Surveyor General Malcolm Fraser, his map showing them occurring at an area measuring 130000 hectares. They were well known to the settlers of the Swan River Colony, the first road from the port to the capital passed through what they named as Claremont Tuart Forest. The first state conservator of forest, John Ednie Brown, reported the remaining extent of tuart forest as 81000ha in 1895, impressed by straight trunked specimens to 50m high and 7m circumference, while conceding the density and condition of them prior to his survey were not known to him. The 1903-04 Royal Commission on Forestry, hearing evidence from sawmiller and government member H. J. Yelverton, reported just over 40000ha remained, and that reduced tonnage from areas where \\"prime trees\\", those over 0.8m in diameter and mostly harvested, had not been found. The conservation of this species was proposed in the commission's summary, emphasising \\"Tuart is the most valuable tree ‚Ä¶\\". This eventually took the form of a regulation on export of tuart, although this was to reserve the timber for its biggest consumer, the state's railway system. When a political means of conserving forest was enacted in 1918, the state conservator Charles Lane Poole's recommendation was the purchase of a 400ha area near Wonnerup, State Forest No. 1 was described as \\"‚Ä¶ the last remaining virgin tuart in the world\\". The State Forest was increased with adjoining areas to around two and a half thousand hectares by 1922, and slightly reduced in 1927 by the conservator S. L. Kessel; his explanation for this change was \\"‚Ä¶ due to the reduction of areas\\". The state sawmill supplying the railway operated in the forest until 1929, using 'over mature' trees for the railway trucks being built at the Midland works. At the beginning of the twenty first century most of the tuart forest had been felled or cleared, and what remained was recognised as declining in diversity and health of this tree and the assemblages of associated plants, animals and fungi.

History =Revolution= The revolutionary courts were created shortly after the overthrow of the monarchy and the arrival of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran. The general goal of the court is thought to have been to seek vengeance against officials of the Shah's regime (particularly SAVAK) ‚Äì as many revolutionaries had lost friends and family members at the hands of the government ‚Äì and to eliminate military and civilian leaders who might foment a counter-revolution against Islamic rule. The first tribunal was convened secretly in Refah School in southern Tehran where Khomeini had set up his headquarters. The first four death sentences were issued by Hojjat al- Islam Sadegh Khalkhali, approved by Khomeini, and carried out in the early hours of February 16, 1979. By early November, 550 people ‚Äì mostly military and SAVAK ‚Äì had been sent to the firing squads by revolutionary tribunals. Revolutionary Tribunals were set up in the major towns, with two courts in the capital of Tehran ‚Äì one each in the prisons of Qasr and Evin, and one traveling tribunal for Sadegh Khalkhali, who was known for handing out many death sentences. The courts presiding judges were clerics appointed by Khomeini himself. At least at first, the revolutionary courts differ from standard Western law courts by limiting trials to a few hours, sometimes minutes. Defendants could be found guilty on the basis of \\"popular repute.\\" The concept of defense attorney was dismissed as a \\"Western absurdity.\\" A charge that was widely applied against defendants but unfamiliar to some was Mofsed-e-filarz, or \\"spreading corruption on earth\\". This covered a variety of offenses ‚Äì \\"insulting Islam and the clergy,\\" \\"opposing the Islamic Revolution,\\" \\"supporting the Pahlavis,\\" and \\"undermining Iran's independence\\" by helping the 1953 coup and giving capitulatory privileges to the imperial powers\\".Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, 1999, p.125 The secrecy, vagueness of charges, lack of opportunity for defendants to defend themselves came under criticism from people such as Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, Hassan Tabatabai-Qomi and Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. But the court's swift and harsh sentences also had strong support from both Islamists and leftist groups such as the Tudeh party and People's Mujahedin of Iran. Khomeini responded to complaints saying that \\"criminals should not be tried, they should be killed\\". Judge Khalkhali stated \\"The revolutionary courts were born out of the anger of the Iranian people and these people will not accept any principles outside Islamic principles\\". Attempts by Bazargan to appeal to Khomeini to restrict the courts only led to the courts becoming \\"stronger and more firmly entrenched\\". =Since 1980= According to political scientist and historian Ervand Abrahamian, the Revolutionary Courts participated in the secret mass killings of thousands of imprisoned members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran and other leftist organizations in 1988.Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, 1999, p.210 Although the Revolutionary Court normally deals with major economic and security crimes, in 2006 it was scheduled to try Cartoonist Mana Neyestani and his editor-in-chief Mehrdad Qassemfar \\"for inciting ethnic unrest\\" after a Neyestani cartoon triggered protests and violence among the Turkish-speaking population in northwestern parts of Iran after appearing in a weekly supplement \\"Iran Jomeh.\\"Iranian Cartoonist will be Tried in the Islamic Revolutionary Court See also *Judicial system of Iran *Special Clerical Court *Criticism of Islam *Freedom of speech in Iran *Corruption in Iran *Smuggling in Iran References External links *Human Rights Watch Condemns Killing Of Iranian Civilians June 3, 1998 *Zan Censored 6 April 1999 Category:Iranian Revolution Category:Ruhollah Khomeini Category:Judiciary of Iran Category:Iranian law Category:1979 establishments in Iran Category:Courts and tribunals established in 1979 ","title":"Islamic Revolutionary Court"},{"id":"7998021","text":"Pothencode, is a rapidly developing town and a developing area of Thiruvananthapuram District in the Indian state of Kerala.

Local sh≈çtengai cater to the needs of nearby residents with a diverse mix of small specialty shops and few large retailers. In many older neighborhoods, these streets serve as cultural gathering spaces, holding seasonal festivals, processions, and other events throughout the year. Many older sh≈çtengai developed along roads leading to a large shrines or temples; Nakamise-d≈çri to Sens≈ç-ji, Asakusa is a typical example. More modern sh≈çtengai often connect to the nearest train or subway station, or other public gathering points such as large parks or landmarks. Most suburbs and towns of Japan have sh≈çtengai of varying size, and larger sh≈çtengai may take the form of covered arcades that are accessible only by foot or bicycle. Commercial features A neighborhood sh≈çtengai may be anchored by one or two large retailers (such as a grocery store or drug store), however the majority of retailers are typically small shops that specialize in specific products such as fruits, vegetables, meats, books, clothing, drugs, furniture, housewares, stationary; or specific services such as barber shops, printing shops, tailors, or cleaners. Restaurants and prepared foods within sh≈çtengai commonly include izakaya, kissaten, wagashi, sushi, udon, ramen or tempura shops. Public services located within or adjacent to sh≈çtengai often include a post office or neighborhood k≈çban police substation. In larger cities, more centrally located sh≈çtengai often include a larger percentage of chain retailers, as well as hotels, convenience stores, or pachinko parlors. Cultural functions Beyond their practical role as commercial districts, sh≈çtengai serve as vital social spaces for Japanese neighborhoods, creating cohesion in a neighborhood through shop owner associations, and hosting seasonal festivals and events together with neighbors. An uncommon feature of most other urban commercial districts, the shop proprietors within sh≈çtengai often own the buildings where their shops operate, rather than leasing space from a single landlord or development firm. This gives sh≈çtengai shop owners more freedom to relate to and serve the social needs of their neighborhood, rather than being forced to focus solely on economic utility.

The Sisters were pioneers of education in North Queensland, and the college stands as a monument to their contributions. With onset of World War II in the Pacific, St Patrick's vacated the College buildings located on The Strand for use by the allied war effort, namely the W.R.A.A.F units. The Wartime College and boarding students were moved to different locations, West End and Ravenswood respectively. During the 1960s and 1970s the college adapted to educational requirements of exam criteria developed by governmental Educational Departments. Later government grants brought new infrastructure providing a library, new science laboratories, social science and language facilities and later computer technology. Current students can participate in the numerous extra curricular activities common to most modern high schools, including national sporting competitions and UN youth summit. Graduates Two mid twentieth century graduates are Madge Ryan and Valma Weetman. Valma Weetman joined the R.A.A.F and became a Corporal during her first two years issuing kits in a Sydney airmen Depot.

He is considered as the last lob bowler to play first-class cricket purely as a bowler. Trevor Molony studied at Repton and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He appeared in but did not take any wickets in the Freshers match but another fine performance for his college won the attention of Digby Jephson. Jephson, himself a former first- class cricketer who bowled underarm, who was then involved in Cambridge cricket, recommended him for Surrey's pre-season trial match at The Oval in April 1921. He took the wicket of Jack Hobbs (who apparently gave away his wicket) in the first innings and three more in the second. This led to him being selected for the Surrey's match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May at the recommendation of the Surrey captain Percy Fender. Surrey was dismissed for 76 and Notts reached 170 for 5 when Molony was introduced into bowling. The Cricketer reported that Molony \\"is a lob bowler who bowls leg theory and bowls it accurately, too. He varies the flight of the ball excellently and bowls an exceedingly good full-toss at awkward height\\". Bowling with eight men on the leg side, Molony went on to take three wickets for 11 runs in seven overs, Notts being all-out for 201. Cricketer recorded that \\"the attempts of the last few batsmen were ludicrous, which evinced much laughter from the crowd, which showed their unmistakable delight in seeing a lob bowler go on\\". Molony took one wicket in his next match against Leicestershire, Albert Lord being caught by the Surrey wicket-keeper Herbert Strudwick who \\"had to catch it or be almost decapitated\\". Possibly on the protest from Strudwick, he was then dropped from the side. Molony was given one more match against Warwickshire in June, but he took no more wickets. He was never again selected for Surrey or their Second XI. He continued in Club cricket for many more years playing for Repton Pilgrims.

If scavenging is incomplete, the remaining exhaust gases can cause improper combustion for the next cycle, leading to reduced power output. Scavenging is equally important for both two-stroke and four-stroke engines. Most modern four-stroke engines use crossflow cylinder heads and valve timing overlap to scavenge the cylinders. Modern two-stroke engines use either Schnuerle scavenging (also known as \\"loop scavenging\\") or uniflow scavenging.  Origins  The first engines deliberately designed to encourage scavenging were gas engines built by Crossley Brothers Ltd in the United Kingdom in the early 1890s. These Crossley Otto Scavenging Engines were made possible by the recent change from slide valves to poppet valves, which allowed more flexible control over valve timing events. The closing of the exhaust valve on occurred more than 30 degrees later than on earlier engines, giving a long 'overlap' period (when both the intake and exhaust valves are open). As these were gas engines they did not require a long period of valve closure during the compression stroke. The exhaust gases were drawn from the engine by a partial vacuum following in the wake of a 'slug' of exhaust gas from the previous combustion cycle. This method requires that the exhaust pipe is long enough to contain the gas slug for the entire duration of the stroke. As the Crossley engine was so slow-revving, this resulted in an exhaust pipe with a length of between the engine and its cast-iron 'pot' silencer.  Types of scavenging  = Crossflow = Cross flow scavenging with a deflector piston Crossflow cylinder heads are used by most modern four-stroke engines, whereby the intake ports are located on one side of the combustion chamber and the exhaust ports are on the other side. The momentum of the gases assists in scavenging during the 'overlap' phase (when the intake and exhaust valves are simultaneously open). = Vertical loop = For two-stroke engines, crossflow scavenging was used in early crankcase-compression engines, such as used by small motorcycles. The transfer port (where the fuel/air mixture enters the combustion chamber) and the exhaust port were located on opposite sides of the combustion chamber. This arrangement had the advantage of simplicity, but it also directed the incoming charge directly towards the exhaust port. To improve the emptying of the cylinder of exhaust gases and retain more of the incoming charge in the cylinder, a deflector piston was often used. This piston shape directed the intake gases towards the top of the cylinder to push the exhaust fumes down and out the exhaust port. However, the deflector piston was not very effective in practice - much of the gas flow took a shortcut path and still failed to reach the top of the cylinder - and the shape of the piston compromised the shape of the combustion chamber by causing long flame paths and excessive surface area. Therefore, vertical loop scavenging is rarely used in modern two-stroke engines. = Schnuerle = Schnuerle scavenging (sometimes called \\"loop scavenging\\" or \\"reverse scavenging\\") is a design used by most modern valveless two-stroke engines. The key difference compared to crossflow scavenging is that the transfer ports are located either side of the exhaust port and aimed at the opposite cylinder wall. As the fuel/air mixture enters the combustion chamber, it travels across the cylinder then up the cylinder wall opposite the exhaust port before looping over at the cylinder head and back down to the exhaust port. This long flow path and opposite directions of intake and exhaust flows minimizes the mixing of the fresh and spent gases and limits the amount of fresh charge which escapes the cylinder prior to the ports closing. This scavenging method does require a greater understanding of the 3-dimensional gas flow in the cylinder and more care in the placement, size, and angle of the various ports. = Uniflow = Uniflow scavenging is a design in which the fresh intake charge and exhaust gases flow in the same direction. This requires that the intake and exhaust ports be at opposite ends of the cylinder. As used by some two-stroke engines, the fresh charge enters through piston-controlled ports near the bottom of the cylinder and flows upward, pushing the exhaust gases out through poppet valves located in the cylinder head. Other uniflow engines - such as the Ricardo Dolphin marine engine - use a downward flow direction, with the fresh air/fuel mixture entering at the top of the cylinder and the exhaust gases exiting at towards the bottom of the cylinder. Yet another design uses piston-controlled ports at both ends of the cylinder and two opposed pistons in each cylinder moving in opposite directions to compress the charge between them. The uniflow method of scavenging has been often used for two-stroke diesel engines in motor vehicles, marine vessels, railway locomotives and as stationary engines. Its drawback is the additional complexity, mass, volume, and cost required to implement the poppet valvetrain (or the additional crankshaft or rocker arms required to control a second piston).

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Bhaktavatsala Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Ennai Petra Thayar. The temple is believed to have been built by the Pallavas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagar kings. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all the shrines and two bodies of water. There is a four-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, in the temple. Bhatavatsala Perumal is believed to have appeared to Kubera. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Krishna Janmasthami festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Aavani (August‚ÄìSeptember), being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Legend is that Varuna, Samudraraja had worshipped Vishnu at this place. It is also said that Vishnu, returning from this place followed by Lakshmi, stayed here and hence it is called Thirunindravur. It is also that Thirumangai Alvar did not sing any paasuram (songs) here and followed by Vishnu followed Thirukadalmallai and sang song praising the deity Bhaktavatsala Perumal from there. Lakshmi requested Perumal to appear before the azhwar, but when he did Azhwar had already reached Thirukkannamangai. Perumal again appeared in the dreams of the Azhwar who felt that he is viewing Bhatavatsala in Tirukkannamangai. History The temple was built during the Pallava period of 9th century as seen from the various inscriptions in the temple. The earliest inscriptions of the temple is dated between 820 and 890 AD during the period of Nripatungavarman. There are inscriptions from the later Chola kings like Rajendra Chola II (1051‚Äì1063 AD), Virarajendra Chola (1063‚Äì1070 AD) and Rajaraja Chola II (1146‚Äì1173 AD). The Pallava inscriptions mention this place as Ninravur and some of them quote it as Virudhurajabhayankar- chaturvertimangalam, a sub-division of Punarkottam.Madhavan 2007, p. 36 Architecture Anjaneya sannithi located axial to the gopuram outside the tower The temple is built during the, and is estimated to be 1500 years old. The temple has a 5 tier gopuram at the entrance and two precincts. The Moolavar(presiding deity) of the temple is Bakthavasala. The Moolavar is at a standing position facing east. The height of the Moolavar is around . The Utsavar(procession deity) is called Patharaavi is made of panchaloha and is accompanied by two consorts as in most Vaishnavite temples. There is a separate shrine for Ennai Petra Thayar also called Sudhavalli, the consort of Bakthavasala. The temple also has separate shrines for Andal, Chakkarathazhwar, the Alwars and Sri Ramanuja. On the banks of a lake a few meters behind this temple is another temple for Rama. In this temple there is a statue of Hanuman lifting Rama and Lakshmana on his shoulders. The temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department of Tamil Nadu government. The Pedda Jeeyar of Tirupathi is the permanent trustee of the temple.Madhavan 2007, p. 35 Festivals and religious practices thumb The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharatra. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Bakthavatsala Perumal and Sudhavalli Thayar. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The major festival celebrated in the temple are Chitra Pournami during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March - April), Tiruadyana Utsavam during Margazhi (December - January) and Brahmotsavam during Panguni (March - April). The other festivals are Sri Jayanti Utsavam during Aavani, Navaratri, Vijayadasami, Deepavali and Makara Sankranti. Religious importance The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai alvar. The Azhwars have sung praise on the different forms of Bhaktavatsala Perumal. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Many Acharyas have also written songs on the various forms of God in this Temple.Madhavan 2007, p. 34 See also * Religion in Chennai Notes References  External links Category:Hindu temples in Chennai Category:Hindu temples in Tiruvallur district ","title":"Bhaktavatsala Perumal temple, Thirunindravur"},{"id":"7998140","text":"Backstretch refers to either: (1) the portion of an oval racetrack on the far side of the grandstand, parallel to the homestretch, or, (2) particularly in North America, the area near the racetrack where horses are stabled and the daily work of maintaining the horses occurs. In many racetracks, the stabling area is located next to the far side of the track, and may also be called \\"the other side of the track\\" or the \\"backside\\". Portion of the racetack chute, Yellow = homestretch, Red = clubhouse turn, Blue = backstretch, Green = far turn, gray inside line = rail and the white center is the infield. The standard definition of backstretch refers to the configuration of an oval racetrack, where the backstretch is parallel to the homestretch. It is shown in blue on the adjacent diagram. On an oval track, sprint races (typically 7 furlongs or less) begin on the backstretch and go around one turn to the finish line. Longer races start in the homestretch, take one turn into the backstretch, then another turn into the homestretch, so may be called \\"two turn\\" races. Depending on the track dimensions, very long races may consist of three turns, starting on the backstretch and then making a full lap and more. Stabling area Backstretch is also used to refer to the stabling area adjacent to the racetrack. A backstretch is divided into several areas. One, known as \\"shed row\\", is a line of stables, each stable home to many of the horses at the track. There are also dormitories, where workers (many migrant) live; offices for the trainers to register horses for upcoming races; a cafeteria; a recreation hall; and offices for the Chaplain. People working in this area are sometimes described as \\"the backstretch family\\", consisting of trainers, exercise riders, jockeys, grooms, farriers, veterinarians, muckers, jockey agents, and others in various positions. One groom explained the daily routine: \\"I come in about four-thirty. Feed breakfast. Most people have watchers [who observe a horse to make sure it is eating well and shows no signs of illness] when they feed breakfast. We don‚Äôt because the stable‚Äôs not that big. But I come in about four-thirty. Feed. Muck out my stalls. Then about five-thirty‚Äîsix we start training. You know, we pack them up and send them to the track. They come back, we bathe them. But that lasts until ten or ten-thirty. Then we do them up. We put all kinds of liniments and poultices on them and put bandages on them. We feed about eleven a.m. Then we come back about three-thirty. Muck out the stalls again and feed them about five. And then we‚Äôre done...\\" On racedays, the groom is also responsible for leading the horse to and from the racetrack, followed by a bath.

Dossena started his professional career at Verona in 2001, having progressed through the club's youth ranks. Having made 99 league appearances for Verona, he joined Treviso in 2005, and made 21 league appearances for the club. He then joined Udinese in 2006, and had a successful two-year spell, which, after making 63 league appearances, saw him switch to English side Liverpool in July 2008. However, he struggled to adapt to the English game, making just 18 league appearances in two seasons, and he returned to Italy in January 2010, when he signed for Napoli. Although he quickly established himself in the team, he fell out of favour during the 2012‚Äì13 season, and was loaned to Palermo, where he made 11 league appearances. In September 2013, having made 83 league appearances for Napoli, Dossena returned to England when he joined Sunderland. In November 2014 it was announced that Dossena had joined Leyton Orient on a free until the end of the season. He joined Chiasso in 2015. He last played for Piacenza in 2017. He made his full international debut for Italy in 2007, and was part of their team at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, earning 10 caps in total. Club career =Early career= Dossena began his career at Verona as a youth player before playing 4 seasons in their senior squad. He made his Serie A debut on 18 November 2001 in the city derby against Chievo.Gazzetta dello Sport 2007‚Äì08 Profile Italian Serie A team Treviso signed Dossena in a co- ownership deal in 2005. It was Treviso's first season in Serie A after they were promoted due to Genoa being denied this privilege as a result of their role in Caso Genoa. =Udinese= Udinese signed him in 2006 in a co-ownership with Treviso, which became permanent in June 2007. He was given the number 2 jersey and made 63 appearances in the two seasons with Udinese, scoring 2 league goals there.Andrea Dossena Football Profile , Eurosport. Retrieved on 12 July 2008. In October 2007, he was awarded an improved contract which last until 30 June 2012. =Liverpool= Dossena's No.2 jersey (far right), hanging in the Liverpool changing room, 2009 On 4 July 2008, Liverpool confirmed the signing of Dossena on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of ¬£7 million, becoming the second Italian to play for the club, behind Daniele Padelli. Dossena was signed as a direct replacement for John Arne Riise who left for Roma. On 10 July 2008, it was announced that Dossena would wear the number 2 shirt. His debut for Liverpool came on 16 August in the 1‚Äì0 Premier League win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. The start to his career at Liverpool was marked by poor form and he was unsatisfied with his performances, telling The Guardian: > \\"I am not fully happy with my level. I must now get to a high level and > maintain that, but first I have to battle to win selection. I am learning > all the time\\". Dossena reinforced that he was committed to the club and explained that he was having difficulties adjusting because the pace of English football was significantly different from what he had experienced in Serie A. Despite his largely unimpressive performances, he received more opportunities to prove himself in the first team as F√°bio Aur√©lio, Liverpool's favoured left back, suffered an injury in late November.. He lost his first team slot with Aurelio's return from injury combined with the emergence of Emiliano Ins√∫a. He scored his first goal for Liverpool on 10 March 2009 against Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League after coming on as a substitute.McNulty, Phil (10 March 2009). Liverpool 4‚Äì0 R Madrid (agg 5‚Äì0). BBC Sport. Retrieved on 11 March 2009. He scored his first goal in the Premier League four days later, on 14 March in the 4‚Äì1 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford. He scored both goals playing as an auxiliary left-winger as a late substitute in both games. =Napoli= On 8 January 2010, Dossena signed for S.S.C. Napoli in a four-year contract, and was given the number eight shirt The fee quoted was ‚Ç¨4.25 million and Andriy Voronin left on the same day. He made his debut for Napoli on 13 January 2010 in a Coppa Italia match against Juventus. His Serie A debut for Napoli came on 17 January 2010 in the 0‚Äì0 against Palermo at the San Paolo Stadium. Dossena netted a brace in the final game of the season against Siena on 13 May 2012, sending Napoli to a 2‚Äì1 win and guaranteeing Europa League football. In January 2013 Dossena went on loan to Palermo. Following the return of Dossena's former Liverpool manager Rafael Ben√≠tez to Napoli, Dossena was told he would be allowed to look for a new club. =Later years= On 2 September 2013, he moved to Sunderland on a free transfer. Dossena made his Sunderland debut on 27 October, playing at left back in a 2‚Äì1 victory over local rivals Newcastle United. However, Dossena was sent off in Sunderland's next game at Hull City for a stamp on David Meyler. He was released at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season by Sunderland after losing out on first team action to Marcos Alonso. On 6 November 2014, it was announced that Dossena would be joining League One team Leyton Orient on a free transfer until the end of the season. He was released by the club following their relegation to League Two. In February 2017 Dossena signed a contract until the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season with Piacenza Calcio 1919 after training with the club.

Geography Chodavaram is a town located on the country's east coast.Falling Rain Genomics.Chodavaram History The original name of the town was Chola Varam. The Chola dynasty (300 BC to 1279 AD), at that time rulers of Tamil Nadu and coastal Andhra Pradesh, founded Chola Varam as a border post en route to the Gajapathi kingdom of Orissa. In 1941, Chodavaram had a population of 8,379.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952) p. 403 Demographics As of the census of 2011, the town's population was 20,251, composed of 9,868 males and 10,383 females. The sex ratio was 1,052; versus a state average was 993. 2,035 children were aged 0-6, comprising 10.05% of Chodavaram's population and creating a child sex ratio of approximately 951; the state average is 939. The literacy rate in the town of Chodavaram is approximately 77.49%; the state rate is 67.02%.

This prevents the drainage of liquid from the eye. They are used to treat dry eye. Artificial tears are usually still required after punctal plug insertion. Types A temporary punctal occlusion can be inserted and tried first. These are made of collagen and are dissolvable. This is to ascertain that permanent ones will not cause excessive tearing. Permanent punctal plugs are usually made of silicone. These are available in various sizes. For maximum effectiveness, the largest size that fits should be used. These are more effective than collagen plugs. They can sometimes become loose and fall out, in which case they can be replaced. Some plugs are made of thermally reactive material. Some of these are inserted into the punctum as a liquid, and then harden and conform to the individual's drainage system. Others start out rigid and become soft and flexible, adapting to the individual's punctal size after they are inserted.  Risks  The risks of punctal plugs are fairly small. There is a risk of eye irritation, excessive tearing, and, in rare cases, infection. A large silicone plug can cause slight pain upon blinking after insertion. This discomfort may stop within a week. Efficacy A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration sought to assess the safety and efficacy of punctal plugs for the management of dry eye. The review included eighteen studies, testing punctal plugs of different materials, and comparing them to other treatments for dry eye. Overall there were mixed results; punctal plugs did not show consistent improvement of dry eye symptoms compared to the comparison group at follow-up. There was little evidence of differences between silicone and collagen or acrylic punctal plugs. Punctal plugs may be more effective than oral pilocarpine, but may be less effective than artificial tears. Some adverse outcomes from participants included spontaneous plug loss, epiphora, ocular irritation, foreign body sensation, and local inflammatory reaction. Alternatives If punctal plugs are at least partly effective, thermal, electric or radiofrequency (RF) cauterization of puncti can be performed with local sedation. RF cauterization is an electrosurgery office procedure that can be performed by an oculoplastic eye surgeon using a hyfrecator. Before the cauterization, the surgeon tests for the effectiveness of the local sedation. Depending upon the type and depth of the cauterization, it is effective for a few months to a few years, by which time the puncta can possibly regrow and reopen. In this case, cauterization can be repeated. It initially offers complete closure of the duct. It also obviates the need for a punctal plug. It is performed for one puncta per appointment. Depending on the need, it can eventually be done for all four puncta. Cauterization can result in temporary redness for a few hours which is caused by the avoidable use of a protective cover over the eye. Any lasting sensitivity as a result of this cover can be reversed using short-term use of steroid eye drops such as those containing loteprednol.

The film looks at the media world in Margaret Thatcher's Britain around the time of the Falklands War. It was part of Channel 4's Film on Four strand, enjoying a critically lauded theatrical releaseVincent Canby, \\"'The Ploughman's Lunch,' An Exercise in Duplicity,\\" The New York Times, 19 October 1984.Robert McCrum, \\"The Story of His Life,\\" The Guardian, 23 January 2002. prior to the television screenings.  Plot  James Penfield (Jonathan Pryce) is an ambitious London-based BBC radio reporter, from humble origins but Oxford-educated. He is commissioned to write a book on the Suez Crisis, claiming not to be a socialist, at the time as the 1982 Falklands War is dominating the British media. He is attracted to Susan Barrington (Charlie Dore), an upper class, rather snobbish TV journalist, to whom he is introduced by his Oxford friend and fellow TV journalist, Jeremy Hancock (Tim Curry). Although he is persistent, he cannot get further than a late night kiss from her and so Jeremy suggests that he contact her mother, a prominent left-wing historian Ann Barrington (Rosemary Harris) living in Norfolk, and married to advertising film director Matthew Fox (Frank Finlay). It transpires that Ann wrote an article on the Suez Crisis on its tenth anniversary and James wants to seduce the daughter by befriending the mother. Claiming to be a socialist, James soon finds himself spending more time with the mother than her daughter; they have several long discussions and also take long walks on the Norfolk Broads. Meanwhile, his mother is dying and, having earlier said to Susan that his parents are dead in order to disguise his origins, he is forced to identify her only as a relative when his father contacts him while he is with Ann. Returning to London, he is forced to ask for help from members of a women's peace camp after suffering a puncture. Initially mistaken for another BBC man, he shows some feigned sympathy towards the group protesting against the use of force outside a Norfolk airbase. Visiting Norfolk again a week later with an uninterested Susan, James walks alone with Ann Barrington who kisses him and later enters his bedroom and has sex with him. Caught up in this love triangle, James returns to his work in London. Over a beer and pub ploughman's lunch with Matthew Fox, Fox consents to James making love to his wife, given that they have slept in separate beds for the last three years. James refuses to take calls from the mother when she attempts to contact him at the BBC. He finally gets another Oxford friend and up and coming young poet to make a call to her ending the relationship, while he sits idly by reading advertisements in Exchange and Mart. James, Jeremy and Susan cover the 1982 Conservative Party Conference and travel down to Brighton together in James' Jaguar. It is at the start of the conference that James first starts to get an inkling of something going on between the other two and directly asks Jeremy if he is up to something. Later, during the conference, he attempts to talk to Susan but she brushes him off and he then sees them caressing each other, having obviously returned from a hotel room. The Conference finishes with Thatcher's closing address as she rouses popular support following the Falklands War and afterwards James confronts his friend in the Brighton Centre conference hall, calling him a shit for having betrayed him; he in turn is told by Jeremy that he has known Susan for fifteen years and that they are 'old allies'. The film ends with James having a conversation with his publisher about the success of his first book. The closing scene is of James attending his mother's funeral, standing grim-faced and aloof at his father's side, as he impatiently checks his watch.

Although he denies it, he is angry. At one point he says: 'You do everything right and you feel nothing. Either way.' His problem is that he feels everything all too acutely, but it doesn't make him a better person, only more devious. James Penfield is Jimmy Porter of Look Back in Anger updated to the 1980s, specifically to London during the 1982 Falkland war and the Tory leadership of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Ploughman's Lunch, the first theatrical film to be written by Ian McEwan and directed by Richard Eyre, is a witty, bitter tale of duplicity and opportunism in both private and public life...This is tricky stuff, but The Ploughman's Lunch blends fact with fiction with astonishing success.\\"Vincent Canby, \\"'The Ploughman's Lunch,' An Exercise in Duplicity,\\" The New York Times, 19 October 1984. =Box office= Goldcrest Films invested ¬£398,000 in the movie and received ¬£271,000 causing them to lose ¬£127,000.

She first appeared in X-Men #107 (October 1977) and was created by Dave Cockrum and Chris Claremont. She is a member of the intergalactic enforcers known as the Starjammers and currently a member of the Uncanny X-Men. The name of her species, Mephitisoid, is derived from the word Mephitidae, the scientific classification for skunks, which her species noticeably resembles. Publication history Dave Cockrum created the Starjammers with the intent of having them star in their own series. However, when he submitted the concept for Marvel's two try-out series, Marvel Spotlight and Marvel Premiere, he was repeatedly informed that these series were booked for two years solid. Running out of patience, Cockrum showed the Starjammers to X-Men writer Chris Claremont, and convinced him to use the characters for this series. She first appeared in X-Men #107 (October 1977). Fictional character biography =Origin= A member of the Mephitisoid species, Hepzibah was born on the planet Tryl'sart, while under Shi'ar Imperial Rule. Imprisoned by the authority of the then Shi'ar Emperor D'Ken, brother of Deathbird and Lilandra of the Royal House of Neramani, she first met Corsair (Christopher Summers) on the prison labor world Alisbar.Classic X-Men #15 Summers rescued her from a particularly gruesome death sentence (to be eaten alive at a banquet), prompting her to swear an eternal bond to him. The two met fellow prisoners Raza Longknife and Ch'od, and, after escaping Alzibar, the four of them formed the Starjammers. Summers, using the name \\"Corsair\\" in tribute to the science fiction adventurers he had admired during his youth, quickly earned the three aliens' respect and became the group's leader, eventually also winning the heart of Hepzibah, becoming her lover. It was Corsair who gave her the nickname \\"Hepzibah\\" (after the character of Miss Mam'selle Hepzibah from the comic strip Pogo), because her Mephitisoid name consists of a series of scents impossible to reproduce in spoken language. =Encounters with the X-Men= Hepzibah and the Starjammers teamed up with the X-Men on multiple occasions. The first time, the Starjammers came to the aid of the X-Men against D'Ken's Imperial Guard.X-Men Vol. 1 #107 Later, with the other Starjammers, she fought off an alien attack on the HMSS Starjammer starship.Uncanny X-Men #156 After that, she helped save Wolverine's life in outer space, and then engaged in mock combat with Carol Danvers.Uncanny X-Men #157-158 Hepzibah and the Starjammers helped the New Mutants neutralize the threat of the Magus.New Mutants #50 Together with Ch'od, she sought the \\"map- rod\\" holding information on the location of the \\"Phalkon\\" power source. The Phalkon turned out to be the Phoenix. She and the Starjammers were attacked by Deathbird's Shi'ar starships. With the other Starjammers, she first met Excalibur on Earth and aided a rebellion against Deathbird on a Shi'ar border world.X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers #1-2 Later, she was captured by Warskrulls and impersonated by one of them, until she was freed by the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #275-277 =Other encounters= During the Kree/Shi'ar War, she battled Wonder Man and the Vision while escorting the Shi'ar nega- bomb to the Kree Empire.Wonder Man #8 With Raza, she accepted an assignment from the former Kree admiral to kill the Black Knight. With the Starjammers, she visited the Avengers and Binary on Earth. She was thwarted in her attempt to poison the Black Knight, and the plan was foiled. She then returned with the Starjammers to the Shi'ar Empire.Avengers #350-351 Hepzibah also aided the Hulk in rescuing some of the Hulk's people from the alien forces of Troyjan. The Silver Surfer personally saved her life, an incident which led her to believe she simply intimidated the forces threatening her. =The Rise and Fall of The Shi'ar Empire= After Corsair reunited with his son Havok, and the Starjammers participated in a conflict between Lilandra's and D'Ken's forces, Corsair was killed by his own son Vulcan. Hepzibah raided the X-Men's stolen Shi'ar ship's weapons locker and was ready to take vengeance on Vulcan. However, she was forced to return with the repowered Professor X, Warpath, Darwin, and Nightcrawler when Lilandra, hoping to save her beloved Xavier from death and protect some of the X-Men (believing that the battle was not going well) locked the ship into a jump course for Earth. Consequently, Hepzibah, separated from her fellow Starjammers, is currently residing with the X-Men on Earth, with no foreseeable way to return to Shi'ar space to help the Starjammers and Lilandra continue to fight Vulcan. =Member of the X-Men= Since she is stuck on Earth and has nowhere else to go, Hepzibah joins Professor X's team of X-Men. She and Warpath have already created a bond of sorts, with Hepzibah remarking that his presence has helped her through her mourning of Corsair. Together, they confront one of the X-Mansion's guardian Sentinels when Caliban, a long time X-Men ally, runs onto the grounds.Uncanny X-Men #487 She is seen in an altered standard X-Uniform and entering the Morlock Tunnels alongside Warpath, Storm, and Caliban. As a group, they are attempting to discover the reason for the Morlocks' increased activity, which has included the capturing of X-Men ward Leech. Hepzibah, as a furred female with enhanced senses, has multiple problems with the sewers. Hepzibah's name has been written on a Morlock wall, along with the names of the other X-Men team members.Uncanny X-Men #488 Warpath and Hepzibah continue to try to track the Morlocks but the subterranean environment of the Morlock tunnels suddenly triggers Hepzibah's primal instincts, causing her to immediately go into heat as she is now newly single after the death of Corsair, her previous mate. She tells an astonished Warpath that her species \\"burrows to nest\\" and then tries to mate with him, but he refuses saying that it was neither the time nor place, as they were in the middle of a mission. They are then interrupted by a surprise attack of the very Morlocks they were attempting to track.Uncanny X-Men #390 Later after the conflict with the Morlocks, she speaks with Cyclops at the X-Mansion, where he accepts her having chosen Warpath as her new mate.Uncanny X-Men #391 =World War Hulk= Hepzibah is one of the X-Men who answers the Stepford Cuckoos' call for help when the Hulk attacks Professor Xavier.World War Hulk: X-Men #2 =Messiah Complex= Hepzibah disables one of the giant robot O*N*E Sentinels after they become corrupted and attack the X-Mansion.

Hepzibah is one of the X-Force members to engage Predator X; Predator X sprays her with acid hurting her arm. She is then seen standing around Professor X's body.X-Men Vol.2 #207 (2008) =Divided We Stand= Archangel goes to San Francisco, California, to meet up with Hepzibah, Warpath, and Iceman. All four are caught in the effects of a citywide illusion created by Martinique Jason, who has used her powers to transform the city into a hippie paradise. Jason sends Hepzibah, now calling herself \\"Lady Kitten\\", and the others to confront Cyclops and Emma Frost.Uncanny X-Men #498 =Manifest Destiny= Hepzibah relocates with the X-Men to San Francisco. She is shown infuriated at a telephone machine while on a long-distance call to Warpath (who is in Archangel's ranch in Colorado) as she can't hear him, but the reality is that an angst-ridden Warpath is just remaining silent because even though he still wants to speak to her, he is overcome with guilt and shame for all the killing he has done in the name of mutant survival as a member of Wolverine's version of X-Force.X-Force #7 She has been seen in the background of Utopia, having gone to the Island with the X-Men. =Deportation= When Henry Gyrich is made co-director of S.W.O.R.D., he organizes all aliens living on Earth to be deported. While at a bar in San Francisco, Hepzibah is drugged by undercover S.W.O.R.D. agents and taken away by them. Her disappearance among the X-Men leads Cyclops and Emma Frost to contact Beast and Abigail Brand about why S.W.O.R.D. has taken her away to be deported.S.W.O.R.D. #2 Hepzibah and the other aliens help save S.W.O.R.D. from an invasion and depose Gyrich. All of the aliens are returned to their respective homes,S.W.O.R.D. #3 (March‚ÄìApril 2010) with Hepzibah going to stay in Utopia, the new base of the X-Men. =Avengers vs X-Men= An apparently single-again Hepzibah becomes openly flirtatious with other males, going so far as to aggressively proposition Namor for casual sex, even in the company of an amazed Sunspot amidst an impending war between the X-Men and the Avengers over Hope Summers; she later giddily discusses Namor's sexual performance with the Queen of Tabusa Rasa (a previous sexual conquest of Namor turned X-Men ally) even within audible earshot of both Namor and Sunspot.Uncanny X-Men Vol.2 #12 (May 2012) =Marvel Now= Hepzibah is seen again much later in space, where she has been reunited with a mysteriously- resurrected Corsair, and the two of them are on an extended vacation with the younger time-displaced teenage version of Cyclops from All New X-Men. Scott calls her \\"his dad's girlfriend who is an alien cat-skunk-person-thing\\" and also his \\"almost-stepmother\\" who is \\"rather wonderful, honestly\\".Cyclops Vol. 2 #1 (May 2014) Corsair later reveals to Scott, via flashback, that Hepzibah was responsible for his resurrection by convincing the rest of the Starjammers to take his corpse to an alien planet where he was brought back to life. However the process involved him being converted into a somewhat techno- organic cyborg who must now regularly ingest pills containing nano-machines in order to remain alive.Cyclops Vol. 2 #3 (July 2014) Powers and abilities Relative to a human, Hepzibah possesses enhanced agility, speed, reflexes, coordination, balance, hyper-keen senses, and superhumanly acute night vision and sense of smell. Mephitisoids also have retractable claws, and the ability to emit specific mind/mood-altering pheromones at will. Hepzibah is a brilliant natural athlete and acrobat, and skilled hand-to-hand combatant, trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat known in the Shi'ar galaxy. She is also an expert marksman, and is knowledgeable in the operation of a wide variety of ship-sized weaponry. She is often armed with Shi'ar energy guns. Appearance As a member of the Mephitisoid race, Hepzibah's features are supposed to resemble that of a humanoid skunk, with a huge skunk- like tail and fur having the black-and-white coloring pattern of an Earth skunk. However, modern Marvel artists have given her a more cat-like appearance, often making her tail much smaller and making her fur all-white by removing the black markings of her coat altogether. In her modern appearances, Hepzibah's ears are now closer in appearance to those of a skunk as they are now more rounded and on the sides of her head while in her classic appearances, Hepzibah's ears were closer to a cat as they were more pointed and on the top of her head. In other media =Television= * Hepzibah appeared in the \\"Phoenix Saga\\" of the X-Men animated series. She appears as a member of the Starjammers.

Technique  The food is usually wrapped in plastic, aluminum foil, or paper and can be carried (\\"packed\\") in a lunchbox, paper bag (a \\"sack\\"), or plastic bag. While packed lunches are usually taken from home by the people who are going to eat them, in Mumbai, India, tiffin boxes are most often picked up from the home and brought to workplaces later in the day by so-called dabbawallas. It is also possible to buy packed lunches from stores in several countries. Lunchboxes made out of metal, plastic or vinyl are popular. Lunch boxes provide a way to take heavier lunches in a sturdier box or bag. It is also environmentally friendly. In Norway, a very widespread tradition of packing a lunch, called a matpakke, developed out of a free meal programme for schoolchildren instituted in the 1930s, called the Oslo breakfast. Norwegians have only half an hour for lunch and the matpakke is characteristically simple, somewhat boring open faced sandwiches of wholewheat bread packaged in wax paper and separated with smaller sheets of wax paper called mellomleggspapir. It can be eaten quickly allowing the rest of the lunch period to be used to relax. In the United States, an informal meeting at work, over lunch, where everyone brings a packed lunch, is a brown- bag lunch or colloquially a \\"brown bag\\". In politics One such brown-bag lunch was used as a deliberate rebuff of the Chinese hosts, by the United States delegation, at peace negotiations in Kaesong during the Korean War. The Chinese hosts offered lunch and watermelon to the U.S. guests, which the U.S. delegates, who considered lunching with one's opposition to be fraternizing with the enemy, rejected in favor of their own packed lunches.

Among the nearly one thousand recruits in the 104th OVI was future United States Congressman Laurin D. Woodworth. Service record The regiment moved to Covington, Kentucky, on September 1, 1862, in preparation for the Defense of Cincinnati against a threatened Confederate invasion by troops under Edmund Kirby Smith. It was involved in a skirmish at Fort Mitchel in northern Kentucky. The regiment spent the rest of 1862 and most of 1863 in Kentucky defending railroads and Union installations against Confederate raiders. In August, it moved with General Ambrose E. Burnside's army to East Tennessee where it participated in the capture, occupation, and defense of Knoxville during the fall and early winter. Following a brutal winter at Strawberry Plains, TN in pursuit of James Longstreet's retreating forces, it was assigned to duty as part of the XXIII Corps for the Atlanta Campaign. It participated in skirmishes at Dallas, Resaca, and throughout the campaign in northern Georgia, including the relief of Sprague's brigade at the Battle of Decatur on July 22, 1864. The regiment successfully cut the Atlanta and Macon Railroad on 30 July 1864 as a part of the entire army's flanking movement on Jonesboro. The 104th played a key role in the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division's unsuccessful assault on Confederate fortifications at Utoy Creek on August 6, 1864, where it sustained its heaviest casualties of the war up to that point. Following the fall of Atlanta in early September, Schofield's corps was sent north to assist General George Thomas in the defense of Tennessee from General John B. Hood's advancing army. The 104th and Schofield's army escaped Hood's trap at Spring Hill and helped repel the furious Confederate frontal assault at Franklin, TN, where the Confederate Army of Tennessee suffered over 6,000 casualties. After successfully defeating Hood's forces at Nashville in Dec 1864, Schofield's commanded transferred via Georgia, and Washington D.C., reaching North Carolina for the concluding portion of the Carolinas Campaign. The regiment fought a skirmish near Wilmington, NC and was near Raleigh when word came of General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Va.

The Red Cross designation \\"47\\" can be seen on the bow. The Australian Hospital Ships, using ship prefix AHS, were a number of converted civilian ships used for medical services during the Second World War. They were all staffed primarily by the Army Medical staff. The ships fell into two groups: Australian ships and Dutch ships transferred to the Australian Government. The Dutch ships retained their original Dutch officers and Javanese sailors, with replacements from an international pool being added as necessary, and they also continued to sail under the Dutch flag. A third group, closely associated with the island campaigns near Australia and Australian troops, were actually Dutch hospital ships operated under United States Army control. Australian conversions =AHS Manunda= Manunda was an Australian registered and crewed ship converted to a hospital ship in 1940. First sailing to Suez in October 1940, Manunda saw service in both the Middle East and Pacific Campaigns, specifically New Guinea. Manunda was present at the Japanese bombing of Darwin, where she received repairable damage. In September 1946, Manunda ended her wartime service, and was returned to her parent company following a refit, resuming passenger movements around the coast of Australia. =AHS Wanganella= Wanganella was an Australian registered and crewed ship converted a to hospital ship in 1941. She was built by Harland and Wolff Limited in Belfast, in 1932. Originally, the vessel was to be named Achimota and operated by the British and African Steam Navigation Company, but financial difficulties caused the ship to be sold to Huddart Parker. Wanganella served as a hospital ship from 19 May 1941 until 1946, during which time she covered and transported 13,385 wounded. =AHS Centaur= Centaur was British-registered with an Australian crew. She was converted to a hospital ship on 12 March 1943. She was torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-177 on 14 May 1943, during her second voyage to New Guinea as a hospital ship. Of the 332 medical personnel and civilian crew aboard, 268 died. =AHS Oranje= The Oranje, a Dutch-registered vessel of 20,565 tons owned by Stoomvaart Maatschappy Nederland SMN Line, was completed in 1939. While on her maiden voyage to Jakarta, World War II was declared, and by the time she reached her destination, the Netherlands had been occupied by Nazi Germany. Oranje's captain was ordered to Sydney, and to present his ship to Australian authorities. At the same time, the Netherlands Government informed the Australian Government that Oranje was to be converted to a hospital ship, at the Netherlands' cost. Converted at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Oranje continued to be crewed by Dutch officers and Javanese (Indonesian) sailors. Oranje Dutch hospital ships and operated in the Middle East, Indian, and Pacific Campaigns, making 40 voyages over the five years of her service. Other ships Other ships were closely associated with Australian troops and campaigns in the region though not themselves Australian hospital ships. =Maetsuycker= alt=Dutch hospital ship Maetsuycker served as Southwest Pacific Area interbase hospital ship.

Hinilawod is an epic poem orally transmitted from early inhabitants of a place called Sulod in central Panay, Philippines. The term \\"Hinilawod\\" generally translates to \\"Tales From The Mouth of The Halawod River\\". The epic must have been commonly known to the Visayans of Panay before the conquest, since its main protagonists, like Labaw Donggon, were noted in the accounts of the Islanders' beliefs and recorded by early Spanish colonizers. Felix Laureano,Recuerdos de Filipinas, Barcelona: 1795, A. L√≥opez Robert, impresor, Calle Conde de Asalto (currently called \\"Carrer Nou de la Rambla\\"), 63, p. 106. One of these Westerners' accounts says that the adventures of this ancient hero of Panay were recalled during weddings and in songs.Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, Las Islas Visayas en la √âpoca de la Conquista (Segunda edici√≥n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf√≠a de Chofk√© y C.a, p. 42. It was noted that there were still native Mondos of Dingle, Iloilo who worshipped Labaw Donggon even until the last years of the Spanish rule in the Philippines. These worshippers would stealthily enter a certain cave in Dingle in the evening of a certain day of the year, in order to render homage and to offer chickens, doves, rice, bananas, and pigs to the ancient Visayan god. Significance Hinilawod is a 29,000-verse epic that takes about three days to chant in its original form, making it one of the longest epics known, alongside that of Tibet's Epic of King Gesar. Hinilawod is one of the many pieces of oral literature passed from one generation to the next, changed and morphed by the chanter to one degree or another as he told it to his audience. The Hinilawod is not just a literary piece but also a source of information about culture, religion and rituals of the ancient people of Sulod; showing us that ancient Filipinos believed in the \\"sacred,\\" in the importance of family honour and in personal courage and dignity. Hinilawod is the first discovered \\"by accident\\" in 1955, when Filipino anthropologist F. Landa Jocano became interested in native folklore. He travelled the hinterlands of his home island of Panay with two colleagues collecting folk songs, stories, and riddles. It was during one of those trips to the upland barrios of Lambunao, Maasin, Janiuay, and Calinog in Iloilo that his attention was called to a long and popular tale called Hinilawod. Portions of the story were sung to him and his colleague by an old man called Ulang Udig. Returning the following year with a radio technician from Central Philippine University, he then recorded a portion of the story on tape in 1956. However, when he returned, in 1957 to make a recording of the complete story, Ulang Udig could only recount the Epic of Labaw Donggon; he could no longer recount the much larger Epic of Humadapnon. Weeks later, Ulang Udig introduced Jocano to his aunt, an old babaylan named Udungan. However, the old babaylan could only chant little portions of the Humadapnon Epic. Jocano was then introduced to Udungan's niece, mountain singer named Hugan-an, who, after much cajoling, allowed herself to be taped recounting both her story and the Hinilawod. It took three weeks to complete the recording of the 30-hour epic poem. A concise version of the story of Hinilawod can be found in the book Philippine Mythology authored by Jocano. Plot Hinilawod recounts the story of the exploits of three Suludnon demigod brothers: Labaw Donggon, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap of ancient Panay. =Alunsina and Datu Paubari= Kaptan, king of the Gods, decreed that the beautiful Alunsina (also called Laun Sina, \\"Unmarried One\\") be wed upon reaching maidenhood. Though all the unmarried gods from every corner of the universe tried to win her hand in marriage, she chose to marry the mortal Datu Paubari, ruler of the Halawod. Angered by this decision, Alunsina's spurned suitors conspired to harm the newlywed couple. Maklium-sa-t'wan, God of the Plains, called a council of the gods. The deities decided to destroy the Halawod by flood. Fortunately for Alunsina and her husband, her sister Suklang Malayon (Goddess and Guardian of Happy Homes) discovered the evil plot and warned them of it. Before the flood, the couple sought refuge on higher ground and escaped the gods' wrath undetected. They returned to the plains and settled near the mouth of the Halawod after the floods subsided and lived in secrecy. After several months, Alunsina was pregnant with triplets. The couple were ecstatic, and Datu Paubari prepared the things needed for childbirth including the siklot. When the triplets were born, the couple named them Labaw Dongon, Humadapnon, and Dumalapdap. Immediately after birthing her sons, Alunsina summoned the high priest Bungot-Banwa to perform rites on Mount Madya-as to ensure good health for the triplets. Bungot-Banwa burned some alanghiran fronds along with a pinch of kamangyan (incense) on an altar that he had built. He opened the windows of the north side of the room after the ceremony, and in came a cold wind that transformed the infants into strong, mighty, and handsome young men. =The adventures of Labaw Donggon= When he reached adulthood, Labaw Donggon, the eldest of the triplets, decided to go on a quest to find himself a wife. He heard of the beauty of Anggoy Ginbitinan of Handug and wanted her for a wife. He asked his mother to prepare the things he will need for the journey‚Äîa magic cape, hat, belt, and kampilan (a large, two- handed sword). The journey to Handug took several days through plains, valleys, and mountains. When Labaw Donggon finally arrived, he asked for an audience with Anggoy Ginbitinan's mother and asked for her hand in marriage. The marriage was finalized when Labaw Donggon's parents met and discussed with Anggoy Ginbitinan's parents. Using his pamlang (magical charm), Labaw Donggon effortlessly conjured a giant house with ten rooftops and a hundred doors. After their wedding, Labaw Donggon and his new bride started on their journey back to his lands. Upon reaching home, Labaw Donggon asked his mother to care for his new wife and announced his intent on another quest, this time to the Rugal sa Idalom (the netherworld) and vie for the hand of the beautiful Anggoy Doronoon. Labaw Donggon won the hand of the Anggoy Doronoon with little difficulty, and also took her home to his mother. Thereafter, the demigod went on third quest to the Eastern Sky. This time the object of his desire is Malitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, the young bride of Saragnayan, the Lord of Darkness. Aboard his biday nga inagta (black boat), Labaw Donggon sailed across many seas and flew across the region of the clouds and the Land of Stones before he found himself at the shores of the Eastern Sky and the fortress of Saragnayan. Upon setting foot on the shore, Saragnayan asked who he was and what was his business. When Labaw Donggon expressed his desire to have Saragnayan's young wife Malitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, the Lord of Darkness laughed and told him it was impossible. The young demigod then challenged Saragnayan to a duel. The duel lasted for years. Labaw Donggon held Saragnayan's head underwater for seven years but Saragnayan survived. Labaw Donggon then tied Saragnayan to the top of a rock and beat him hard with a coconut trunk, but this proved futile. Labaw Donggon then hurled Saragnayan upwards towards the sky, yet failed to kill him. The two fought for many years until finally, Labaw Donggon weakened. Saragnayan imprisoned the exhausted demigod under his pig pen. Meanwhile, Labaw Donggon's two wives each gave birth to a son. Anggoy Ginbitinan called her child Aso Mangga, while Anggoy Doronoon called her son Buyung Baranugon. Both sons went in search of their father a few days after they were born. They arrived in the Eastern Sky and asked Saragnayan to free their father. Saragnayan instead summoned a host of minions from the underworld to defeat the youths. Wielding bows, Aso Mangga and Buyung Baranugon shot poisoned arrows, that dealt seven wounds with a single shot, slaying the rest until only Saragnayan remained. Saragnayan wrestled with Buyung Baranugon, but the Lord of Darkness was no match for him. However, Saragnayan could still not die. Buyung Baranugon sought aid from his grandmother, Alunsina, and learned that Saragnayan's life was housed in the body of a boar in a place called Paling Bukid. The sons then killed the boar and ate its heart, rendering Saragnayan mortal. Sensing that death was near, Saragnayan bade a sorrowful farewell to his wife. Buyung Baranugon finally killed Saragnayan by jabbing poisoned arrows into both of Saragnayan's eyes. After the victory, Buyung Baranugon and Aso Mangga failed to find their father, who hid under a fishnet out of fear during the battle. Believing their father to have returned home before them, the brothers sailed home only to realize that Labaw Donggon was still missing. Humadapnon and Dumalapdap then searched for their missing brother, finding Labaw Donggon under the fishnet in a deranged state. Labaw Donggon's brothers returned him home to his wives. Anggoy Ginbitinan and Anggoy Doronoon cured Labaw Donggon from his madness and his former strength returned to him. =The adventures of Humadapnon= Meanwhile, the defeat of Labaw Donggon at the hands of Saragnayan and his subsequent imprisonment angered his brothers Humadapnon and Dumalapdap. Humadapnon swore by the gods of Madya-as that he would seek revenge on all of Saragnayan's kinsmen and followers. He then embarked on a journey to the Eastern Sky, taking with him Buyong Matanayon of Mount Matiula, a man known for his exceptional swordsmanship. Together, they travelled the same path that Labaw Donggon had taken. After seven months in Tarambang Buriraw, Buyong Matanayon recalled that they brought some ginger with them. He thought of a plan to break Piganun's spell over his friend. One evening over dinner, Buyong Matanayon threw seven slices of ginger into the fire. Upon smelling the burning ginger, Piganun fled the room. Buyong Matanayon then struck Humadapnon in the head, rendering the latter unconscious. He then dragged his body away from the place and managed to escape. Humadapnon rose to the challenge and took off his magic cape. He then used it to lift the huge boulder off the center of the village and hurled it back towards the mountain. Datu Umbaw Pinaumbaw honored his word and gave his daughter's hand in marriage to Humadapnon. The two were married and a big feast was held. During the banquet, a guest minstrel sang and extolled the beauty of Burigadang Pada Sinaklang Bulawan, Goddess of Wealth and Greed. Enchanted by the story, Humadapnon started on a quest to seek the goddess' hand in marriage. He met Buyong Makabagting, son of the Datu Balahidyong of Paling Bukid, who was also vying for the hand of Burigadang Pada Sinaklang Bulawan. The two duelled and Humadapnon emerged victorious, the defeated Buyong Makabagting helping the former in his quest. Humadapnon eventually married Burigadang Pada Sinaklang Bulawan and brought her home to his mother. Below are verses from the first two stanzas of the second part of Sugidanun I (First Narration) of the Sulodnon epic Hinilawod: Adventures of Humadapnon chanted by Hugan-an and recorded by Dr. F. Landa Jocano. The epic is in the original Sulodnon language.Hinilawod: Adventures of Humadapnon, chanted by Hugan-an and recorded by Dr. F.

He decided go to Burutlakan-ka-adlaw and marry the maiden Lubay-Lubyok Hanginun si Mahuyokhuyokon. With him was Dumasig, the most powerful wrestler in Madya-as. After several months of traveling, the two warriors came face to face with a two-headed monster called Balanakon. The monster guarded the ridge that led to the place where the maiden lived. They managed to kill the monster but were confronted with another kind of monster when they reached the gate of the palace where the maiden lived. Called Uyutang, the monster was similar to a bat with sharp, poisonous claws. Dumalapdap fought with the Uyutang for seven months. He was able to defeat the monster when he grabbed its ankle and broke it. Then he took his twang daniwan (magic dagger) and struck Uyutang under the armpit. The monster howled in pain, causing an earthquake that broke the ridge they were fighting in into two. Half of the ridge became an island that is known today as Negros, while the other half became Panay. With the monster Uyutang dead, Lubay-Lubyok Hanginun si Mahuyokhuyokan was free to marry Dumalapdap. He brought her home and was reunited with his family. Datu Paubari celebrated the return of his three sons with a very big feast. His sons left for different parts of the world after the feast. Labaw Donggon ventured north, Humadapnon went south, and Dumalapdap embarked to the west. Datu Parubari was left to rule in the east. =The quest of Humadapnon continues= Humdapnon was visited by his spirit friends Taghoy and Duwindi in his dream and told him of lovely maiden who lived in a village by the mouth of the Halawod River. The demigod left his dominion to look for the maiden named Nagmalitong Yawa. He brought with him a boatful of crew. Humadapnon and his men safely traversed a blood-coloured sea with the help of his spirit friends. They landed on an island that was inhabited by beautiful women and headed by the sorceress, Ginmayunan. For seven years, Humadapnon and his crew were imprisoned in the island until Nagmalitong Yawa helped them escape by disguising as a boy. Humadapnon and Nagmalitong Yawa were married soon after in Halawod. During the wedding feast, Humadapnon's brother, Dumalapdap fell in love with Huyung Adlaw and asked his brother to help him talk to the parents of the maiden. Humadapnon left his new wife and accompanied his brother to the Upperworld where Huyung Adlaw lived. It took the brothers seven years to come back from their journey to the Upperworld. They arrived just in time for the ceremony that will have Nagmalitong Yawa married to Buyung Sumagulung, an island fortress ruler, in a ceremony. The brothers were enraged and killed all the guests and the groom. Humadapnon also stabbed his wife because the treachery only to feel remorse later on. He asked his spirit friends and found out that his wife only agreed to marry Buyung Sumagulung because her mother, Matan-ayon, convinced her that Humadapnon is not coming back. Upon learning of this, Humadapnon asked his sister, Labing Anyag, to use her powers to bring Nagmalitong Yawa back to life. Seeing how remorseful he is, Labing Anyag agreed. However, Nagmalitong Yawa was so ashamed of agreeing to marry Buyung Sumagulung that she ran away to the underworld and sought the protection of her uncle Panlinugun, who is lord of the earthquake. Humadapnon had to kill an eight-headed serpent in his pursuit of Nagmalitong Yawa. Then he had to duel with a young man who spirited his wife away. The duel ended when Alunsina intervened and revealed that the young man is also her son, Amarotha. This son died during childbirth and was brought back from the dead to keep Alunsina company. Alunsina decided that both Humadapnon and Amarotha deserved a piece of Nagmalitong Yawa so she cut the girl in half and gave a piece each to her sons. Each half turned into a whole live person. Humadapnon brought his wife back to Panay. In theatre An abridged version was the first stage performance of the epic during the inauguration of the Cultural Center of Western Visayas on the campus of West Visayas State University in Iloilo City, Philippines in March 1983 under the patronage of the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the former First Lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos. The cultural group, Panayana performed the epic before the representatives of the First Lady and the high officials of the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Art Geroche, a local Ilonggo artist and Staff of the West Visayas State College (now a State University), provided a mural painting (oil on canvas) depicting the epic, for the lobby of the Cultural Center. The painting captures the important scenes in the adventures of the heroes of Hinilawod, in one panoramic view within a six by twelve feet opus of Geroche. This epic, which is orally transmitted from one generation to another, is still very much a part of the culture of the Sulod Nation in the mountains of Jamindan, Capiz. In April 1999, Alejo Zata recorded the epic as it was chanted by the natives of Sulod.Hinilawod, The Epic of the Hiligaynon Nation University of San Agustin Little Theater (USALT) has staged its version of the Humadapnon fragment of the Hinilawod titled \\"Tarangban\\" (\\"Cave\\"). It first staged the play in 2004. The production was revised to include the participation of then 17-year-old Manilyn \\"Tata\\" Glemer, a member of the Panay Bukidnon tribe in Tapaz, Capiz. Glemer knows how to chant the epic. Research was conducted with Glemer's mother, Gemma, the chieftain of their tribe and her grandmother, Lola Gamak, a binukot and chanter of the tribe. Since 2006, the late-January Hirinugyaw-Suguidanonay Festival of the town of Calinog in Central Panay (which started in 1988 as an adaptation of the Dinagyang Festival where it was then known as the Sirinayaw, then Hirinugyaw Festival) has used segments and tales of the Hinilawod as performance themes of its competing tribes.http://mybeautifuliloilo.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-great- literary-show-through.html Each performance's authenticity is enhanced through the use of authentic Panay Bukidnon (Sulod) costumes, known as Panubok, and the performing tribes' employment of Panay-Bukidnon Manunuguids (Chanters, hence the 'Suguidanonay' in the festival's name) from the Balay Tulun-an Cultural Preservation School in the Panay-Bukidnon settlement in Brgy. Garangan in Calinog's mountainous areas. Of note is the fact that the town itself sits squarely beside the river Jalaur the ancient name of which was Halawud, the river that gave the epic its name. It had subsequent stagings of excerpts in 2010 for the \\"Tanghal 4: The National University and Colleges Theater Festival and Conference\\" on Feb. 2 at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde and for \\"Pasinaya Festival\\" at Tanghalang Huseng Batute of the Cultural Center of the Philippines on Feb. 7. There was also a performance on March 1, 2010 at the USALT auditorium. In 2010, Hiyas Kayumanggi staged their version of the Hinilawod at Luce Auditorium of Silliman University. In 2011, the group staged their production at Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo of the Cultural Center of the Philippines on September 3 and 4. In 2013, Ateneo Entablado staged Nicanor Tiongson's play Labaw Donggon: Ang Banog ng Sanlibutan in Cervini Field, Ateneo de Manila University. The production was directed by Jerry Respeto with composers Jema Pamintuan and Teresa Barrozo, costume and set designer Gino Gonzales, lighting designer Voltaire de Jesus, and choreographers Gio Gahol and Elena Laniog.

The character is usually seen in the X-Men series and various spin-offs. He is the last known surviving member of his unnamed alien race (which chose to die en masse in one final battle against the Shi'ar empire as the culmination of their warrior culture), and a member of the Starjammers. Publication history Dave Cockrum created the Starjammers with the intent of having them star in their own series. However, when he submitted the concept for Marvel's two try-out series, Marvel Spotlight and Marvel Premiere, he was repeatedly informed that these series were booked for two years solid. Running out of patience, Cockrum showed the Starjammers to X-Men writer Chris Claremont, and convinced him to use the characters for this series. Fictional character biography While imprisoned on Alisbar, Raza Longknife (his last name is an English translation of his true last name) met and formed the band of smugglers and space pirates known as the Starjammers; with Corsair, Hepzibah, and Ch'od, and associated himself with the group.Classic X-Men #15 He is a cyborg, being partly living flesh and partly machine. Because Raza speaks an archaic dialect of his native language, his words are translated into an equally archaic form of English, which can be both an annoyance and a source of amusement to his allies. Raza was married, though his wife is now deceased, and he has a son named Rion. \\"His initial grudge against the Shi'ar came about when their former emperor, D'Ken, slaughtered Raza's race of people, but Vulcan became the focus of Raza's rage after he murdered Raza's friend Corsair.\\"THE KINGS' MEN: White Pawns With the Starjammers, he came to the aid of the X-Men against D'Ken's Imperial Guard.X-Men Vol. 1 #107 Much later, with the other Starjammers, he fought off an alien attack on the Starjammer vessel.Uncanny X-Men #156 He engaged in mock combat with Carol Danvers, after she joined with the Starjammers.Uncanny X-Men #158 With the Starjammers, he aided the New Mutants in combat against the Magus.New Mutants #50 Together with Danvers, then known as Binary, he sought the \\"map-rod\\" holding information on the location of the \\"Phalkon\\" power source; this power source turned out to be the Phoenix.

Frequently compared to contemporaries Shigeru Ban and Kazuyo Sejima, Kuma is also noted for his prolific writings. He is the designer of the New National Stadium, Tokyo which has been built for 2020 Summer Olympics.  Early life and education  Kuma was born in Kanagawa, and attended Eiko Gakuen junior and senior high schools. After graduating in Architecture from the University of Tokyo in 1979, he worked for a time at Nihon Sekkei and Toda Corporation. He then moved to New York City for further studies at Columbia University as a visiting researcher from 1985 to 1986.  Career  In 1987, Kuma founded the Spatial Design Studio, and in 1990, he established his own firm, Kengo Kuma & Associates. He has taught at Columbia University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Keio University, where in 2008, Kuma was awarded a Ph.D. in architecture. As a professor at the Graduate School of Architecture at the University of Tokyo, he runs a variety of research projects concerning architecture, urbanism and design within his laboratory, Kuma Lab.http://kuma- lab.arch.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/about.html Kengo Kuma & Associates employs over 150 architects in Tokyo and Paris, designing projects of diverse type and scale throughout the world.  Philosophy and writings  Kuma's stated goal is to recover the tradition of Japanese buildings and to reinterpret these traditions for the 21st century. In 1997, he won the Architectural Institute of Japan Award and in 2009 was made an Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France. Kuma lectures extensively and is the author of numerous books and articles discussing and criticizing approaches in contemporary architecture. His seminal text Anti-Object: The Dissolution and Disintegration of Architecture written in 2008, calls for an architecture of relations, respecting its surroundings instead of dominating them. Kuma's projects maintain a keen interest in the manipulation of light with nature through materiality. = Material theory = Bato Hiroshige Museum Although remaining in continuity with Japanese traditions with the clarity of structural solutions, implied tectonics, and importance of light and transparency, Kuma does not restrain himself to the banal and superficial use of ‚Äòlight‚Äô materials. Instead, he goes much deeper, extending to the mechanisms of composition to expand the possibilities of materiality. He utilizes technological advancements which can challenge unexpected materials, such as stone, into providing the same sense of lightness and softness as glass or wood. Kuma attempts to attain a sense of spatial immateriality as a consequence of the ‚Äòparticulate nature‚Äô of the light and establishing a relationship between a space and the natural round around it. Commune by the Great Wall of China Describing his practice, Kuma said ‚ÄúYou could say that my aim is ‚Äòto recover the place‚Äô. The place is a result of nature and time; this is the most important aspect. I think my architecture is some kind of frame of nature. With it, we can experience nature more deeply and more intimately. Transparency is a characteristic of Japanese architecture; I try to use light and natural materials to get a new kind of transparency.‚Äù In many of Kuma‚Äôs projects, attention is focused on the connection spaces; on the segments between inside and outside, and one room to the next. The choice of materials stems not so much from an intention to guide the design of the forms, but to conform to the existing surroundings from a desire to compare similar materials, yet show the technical advances that have made possible new uses. When dealing with stone work, for example, Kuma displays a different character from the preexisting buildings of solid, heavy, traditional masonry construction. Instead his work surprises the eye by slimming down and dissolving the walls in an effort to express a certain ‚Äúlightness‚Äù and immateriality, suggesting an illusion of ambiguity and weakness not common to the solidity of stone construction. In parallel, Kuma showed material innovation to support local traditional craftsmanship through his works. Collaborating with Japanese craftsmen specialized in wood, earth or paper, he helped maintaining the associated building techniques while modernizing them, bringing his know-how in modularity. This work led Kuma to win a Global Award for Sustainable Architecture in 2016.  Projects  Key projects include the Suntory Museum of Art in Tokyo, Bamboo Wall House in China, LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) Group's Japan headquarters, Besan√ßon Art Center in France, and one of the largest spas in the Caribbean for Mandarin Oriental Dellis Cay.Mandarin Oriental Dellis Cay . Stone Roof, a private residence in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, consists of a roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone into thin slices and bracing each slice as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, a new kind of transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side. In 2016, Kuma also delved into designing pre-fabricated pavilions in partnership with Revolution Precrafted. He designed the mobile multifunctional pavilion named The Aluminum Cloud Pavilion. The structure, composed of aluminum panels joined using Kangou technique, can be used as a teahouse or a space of meditation.http://revolutionprecrafted.com/project/the-aluminum-cloud- pavilion-by-kengo-kuma/ As a part of the TIME-SPACE-EXISTENCE video interview series Kengo Kuma collaborated with the European Cultural Centre to create a video documentation discussing the topics Time Space and Existence.  Kuma Lab  Kuma Lab is a Research Laboratory headed by Kuma based in the Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tokyo's Hongo Campus that was started in 2009. In 2012, Kuma Lab published the book Patterns and Layering, Japanese Spatial Culture, Nature and Architecture,including the research from various Doctoral Candidate Lab members.Edited by Salvator-John A Liotta and Matteo Belfiore.

The distinctive features are: * earth or rubble fill * transverse cross beams at approximately 2 ft (60 cm) intervals * longitudinal timbers laid on the cross beams and attached with mortice joints, nails, or iron spikes through augered holes * outer stone facing * cross beams protruding through the stone facing The technique was described by Julius Caesar in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars: > \\"But this is usually the form of all the Gallic walls. Straight beams, > connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal > intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are morticed on the > inside, and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals which we have > mentioned, are closed up in front by large stones. These being thus laid and > cemented together, another row is added above, in such a manner, that the > same interval may be observed, and that the beams may not touch one another, > but equal spaces intervening, each row of beams is kept firmly in its place > by a row of stones. In this manner the whole wall is consolidated, until the > regular height of the wall be completed.\\" > \\"... it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defence of > cities; for the stone protects it from fire, and the wood from the battering > ram, since it [the wood] being morticed in the inside with rows of beams, > generally forty feet each in length, can neither be broken through nor torn > asunder.\\" About 30 structures of this type have been excavated, mainly in Gaul, but extending to the upper reaches of the Rhine and Danube. The example at the sea promontory fort of Le Camp d'Artus, at Huelgoat, was excavated and reported by Mortimer Wheeler. The murus gallicus contrasts with other construction styles: * Pfostenschlitzmauer ‚Äì characterised by upright wooden posts in the outer wall, typical in central Europe. * Dacian Wall ‚Äì inner and outer stone walls reinforced with inner horizontal timber tie beams.

Some cards have recognized legal status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist. The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: news organizations, law-enforcement agencies, and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate press conference). Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold multiple press passes simultaneously. Law-enforcement cards A Denver press pass. Police departments at a city, county, or state/provincial level may issue press passes in some countries. Such passes allow the bearer to cross police or fire lines to report breaking news, or grant access to crime scenes or other restricted areas‚Äì though admission may be denied if it would interfere with the duties of emergency personnel. Popular media of the mid-20th century often depicted reporters at a crime scene with their press passes tucked into their hat bands, which was unusual in reality. Because of the exceptional dispensation endowed by police press passes, they are issued with discretion‚Äìsome jurisdictions require an in-person interview with all prospective applicants, complete set of fingerprints, and a background check. Generally, only reporters who cover breaking news are eligible; other journalists (feature writers, editors and editorialists, freelance writers, and bloggers) are not. Police-issued passes do not grant access to government press conferences or any other such privileges: they are only recognized by emergency response personnel, and only valid within the jurisdiction of the issuing agencies. =Parking permits= Police parking permits, issued in some jurisdictions, exempt news vehicles from certain parking restrictions while on the job. They may be offered to any news-gathering organization that covers breaking news for use in company vehicles employed by full-time reporters, photographers, and camera operators. Often, these permits are only granted to journalists who already carry a police press card. When conspicuously displayed, these permits may allow the bearer to park in restricted \\"resident- only\\" parking zones, and may exempt him or her from parking-meter costs. These privileges apply only for the duration of breaking-news coverage, and do not nullify all parking restrictions: red zones, fire hydrants, crosswalks, bus zones, disabled parking zones or access ramps, commercial loading zones, taxi cab zones, \\"no stopping\\" or \\"no parking\\" zones, transit lanes, and other towaway zones are still off-limits. Event-specific 2005 WTO conference in Hong Kong For tradeshows, community gatherings, sporting events, award shows, professional conferences, or major events of any type, press passes are generally available. These are sometimes referred to as \\"press badges\\". For many events publicity in news media and elsewhere is of great importance, and granting privileges to the press can help in this. The privileges granted to holders of press badges, and who is eligible to receive them, depends on the nature of the affair. Generally, prospective recipients must apply in advance, offering evidence of their affiliation. Event sponsors may request past published material, or a letter from the news agency on its letterhead, detailing the job assignment. Generally, non-reporting employees of news agencies (executives, sales personnel, publishers, editors, etc.) are not eligible for press passes. In addition to journalists, some bloggers may be granted event passes. Many major events, especially trade shows, issue press kits to pass-holders. A press pass may allow the bearer to request interviews with noteworthy attendees, and special rooms are sometimes set aside for this purpose. =Open events= 1900 press pass to a William Jennings Bryan speech For activities open to the public, such as community gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend on the number of tickets sold. =Closed events= For events closed to the general public, police- or news organization-issued press passes sometimes grant access, but almost all require advance application for admittance. Greater exclusivity, however, means more restrictions on potential pass recipients. For professional conferences or trade shows, passes may be granted only to journalists who regularly cover the industry or who hold a title of \\"industry analyst\\", or with an editorial or reporting designation. News agency cards Press card issued by Wikinews. \\"You do not need to ask permission from anyone to be a journalist,\\" explains the Periodical Publishers Association; \\"however, it is sometimes useful to be able to identify yourself as a journalist when needed.\\" To this end, journalistic agencies issue press cards to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers. These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event- specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization. As such, card- carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues. In the United Kingdom, the UK Press Card Authority (a voluntary consortium of news agencies) issues a nationally standardized card to United Kingdom-based news gatherers. In most other European countries, cards are issued by national trade unions of journalists. Some require membership or government approval. For freelance journalists, organizations like the National Writers Union, Professional Publishers Association Creative News Service(CNS) from ICC national Union of Journalists (UK) or US Press Association issue cards. Fake cards Genuine press cards can be obtained by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be made, and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists to rulers). ;Spurious cards Press passes not issued by a recognised publication can be obtained or made, with the intention of gaining benefits offered to holders of legitimate press cards. Joan Stewart of the Public Relations Society of America reports, ‚ÄúFake press passes abound at restaurant and theater openings, sporting events, music festivals, political rallies, celebrity parties and even crime scenes. With a decent computer and color printer, almost anybody can crank out an official- looking pass within minutes.‚Äù ;Counterfeit cards Counterfeit copies of cards issued by legitimate publications can be made. Issuers of cards have taken measures to prevent counterfeiting of their cards, creating cards with holographic foil blocking, signature strips, and tamper-resistant lamination.

Plot introduction The plot concerns the quest of Philip Vanderdecken of Terneuzen in the Netherlands to save his father - who has been doomed to sail for eternity as the Captain of the Bewitched Phantom Ship, after he made a rash oath to heaven and slew one of the crew whilst attempting to sail round the Cape of Good Hope. Vanderdecken learns upon his mother's death that there exists a way by which his father's disturbed spirit may be laid to rest, and vows to live at sea until he has spoken with his father face to face and accomplished this purpose. Vanderdecken sails around the world in a number of ships, in the employ of the Dutch East India Company, so that he can redeem his father by presenting him with the relic of the Holy Cross he wears round his neck. His quest, however, brings him into conflict with earthly and unearthly powers as the sight of the Flying Dutchman brings doom to all who encounter her. Themes The legend of the Flying Dutchman forms the background to the story and makes regular appearances throughout the novel, while Marryat adds many other supernatural details. He introduces as the heroine, Amine, the daughter of one Mynheer Poots, a miser. Having Arab blood in her veins, she possesses some of the secrets of Arabian magic, but her incautious use of her magic arts brings her into the dungeons of the Inquisition at Goa. Likewise, there is Schrifter, the demon pilot; and Krantz, with a tale of horrors in the Harz mountains; atrocious monks; and ghosts that will not be drowned. Publication The novel was originally serialised in The New Monthly Magazine beginning in March 1837 and ending in August 1839. One chapter concerning a werewolf has often been excerpted in anthologies of supernatural fiction as The White Wolf of the Hartz Mountains. Reviews The reviews for the novel were generally poor. The Athenaeum thought that the work \\"falls sadly short of the racy marine stories by which the author won his first fame\\". In particular, it noted that Marryat \\"dashes off scenes of portent and terror with the same familiar and slip-shod style ... and the result is a feebleness of effect, not to be found in his other novels.\\"The Athenaeum (1839), Issue 599, page 297 Likewise in referring to the book, The Dublin Review thought that the \\"falling off in his last novel ... is very considerable\\", and stated that \\"a string of extravagant adventures, carelessly put together, and heavily told, deaden curiosity,‚Äîthe Flying Dutchman makes his appearance as regularly as a packetboat, and becomes at last almost as tiresome.\\"The Dublin Review (1839), Volume 7, page 242 In June 1839 Burton's Gentleman's Magazine published an anonymous review of the novel which it is believed was written by Edgar Allan Poe. The review was largely an attack on Marryat's abilities as a writer. Turning to The Phantom Ship Poe wrote: In more recent times S.T. Joshi has called the novel \\"an aesthetic disaster - appallingly prolix, and written in a stiff, cumbersome style that reads like a bad translation from a foreign language.\\" S.T.

There is a very large Shiva temple that is run by the Devasthanam of the family of the Rajah of Sivaganga and a trust of the zamindar family of Devakottai. Kalayar kovil is very important town in Sivagangai district.  Location  The temple Kalaiyar Kovil is in Sivaganga District, east of Sivagangai.  Name of temple  Kalaiyar Kovil derived its name from the Kaleeswarar temple of the place. Kalaiyar is a corruption of the word Kaleeswaran. During the Sangam period, this place was known as Kaanapair as is seen from the 21st verse in the purananooru sung by Iyur moolakizhar, a poet of the Sangam period. In the 9th Century A.D. Saint Sundara moorthy nayanar described the presiding deity in his devotional songs as Kaalai. Since then the deity was known as Kalaiyar, with the Tamil sufix yar added to it denoting respect. The temple came to be known as Kalaiyar Kovil and this was later adapted to the place also. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. Temple structure Kalaiyar kovil A lofty Rajagopuram (150 feet) and an imposing Teppakkulam tank (with a mandapam) named Aanai madu adorn this shrine. Airavatam the elephant of Indra is said to have created this tank. There are three shrines in this temple associated with the three functions of creation, preservation and completion. The presiding deity lord shiva is called as Kaaleeswarar, Someswarar, Sundareswarar and the Ambal his consort mother Parvathy is called as Swarnambikai, Soundara Nayagi, Meenakshi. Additional to that there are 3 separate shrines for both the male and female deities of famous Shiva temples in a mandapam outside the shrine.  Seat of kings  Kalaiyarkoil was the seat of the kings from very early days. King Vengai Marban ruled over this area during Sangam period. It was the stronghold of rulers of Sivangangai. It was also the seat of the freedom fighters like Muthu Vaduga Natha Thevar and Maruthu brothers.  Puranam  KaliDevi fought against chandasuran at kalayarkovil. She prayed the kaleewarar lingam and joined hands with saptha mathargal and won the battle. That is why the place is named as kaleepuram.  History  On 25 June 1772, the Company forces under Col. Joseph Smitt and Cap. Bonjour marched towards Kalayar Kovil. The second king of Sivaganga, Muthu Vaduga Natha Thevar (1750‚Äì1772) and Maruthu brothers defended it. Rajah Muthu Vaduganatha Thevar in anticipation of the English invasion made preparation for defence. But Rajah Muthu Vaduganatha Thevar with the many of his soldiers fell dead in the kalaiyarkoil battle. The invading English forces plundered Kalaiyarkoil and collected jewels worth 50,000 pagodas. Kalaiyarkoil temple belongs to Sivagangai Devasthanam. The temple was kept locked and prayers stopped for some time. it was later re opened and substantial repairs and development were done by Devakottai Zamindar. In fact Shree AL.AR.RM.Arunachalam Chettiar, Zamindar of Devakottai took up sanyas from Koviloor and moved to the vedantha madam at kalayar kovil. He was known as Shreelashree Jamindar Arunachala Gnana Desiga Swamigal and his samadhi is in the rear of the madam.

As a result, the city was annexed to the Bulgarian State and remained so until the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire. Historical background After the destruction of the Avar Khaganate, Khan Krum turned his gaze to the southwest to liberate the Slavs who populated the valley of the Struma River and Macedonia. The main obstacle was the strong Byzantine-held fortress of Serdica (Sofia). The Byzantine Empire was the first to initiate the conflict. In 807, the emperor Nikephoros I marched against Bulgaria but was soon forced to return to Constantinople due to a conspiracy against him. The following year, the Bulgarians, in response to an equestrian raid in the valley of the Struma River, defeated the Byzantines and captured their baggage. In the spring of 809, Khan Krum surprised his enemies with the siege of Serdika.  The siege  In the beginning of 809 Krum besieged the city, but he could not break the resistance of the garrison for several weeks. The food supplies of the city were in decline and the numbers of the garrison were reduced due from the fact that part of the hired mercenaries were released during the winter. The Byzantines were soon forced to give up the city. Khan Krum promised to give safe conduct for the Byzantines on condition they yield the fortress. They agreed and Krum entered Serdica before Easter, but he killed the whole 6,000-strong garrison and some citizens nonetheless. Nikephoros I was unhappy with the Byzantines who escaped from the city and some of them decided to stay with the Bulgarians. One of these was the highly skilled mechanic Evmat who would help Krum later on with the construction of siege machines.  Aftermath  The successful siege was of great importance for Bulgaria because Serdica was a major crossroad in the Balkans. It was used as a main base by the later rulers of the country to expand their borders and influence to the south and southwest.

Pedro (vocals), Ka (guitars), Dani (drums) and Ivan (bass) have released five studio albums. They write, compose and sing their own lyrics and music which sound powerful with a strong, melodic impact. Finley has sold over 1,300,000 records in Italy and they have won many awards, including two \\"Best Italian Act\\" at MTV Europe Music Awards: the first one in 2006 (Copenhagen) and the second one in 2008 (Liverpool) becoming, along with Subsonica, the most award- winning Italian band. The band took its name from NBA star Michael Finley. Career =Formation and early years (2002‚Äì2004)= Finley was formed in 2002 in Legnano under the name \\"Junkies\\": the band consists of school friends with a passion for the same kind of music. Pedro, Ka, Dani and Ste decided to start a band, immediately focusing on writing their own songs. Their first rehearsal venue was the little cellar of a rock club they attended on week- ends. They recorded their first EP titled \\"Simply a demo\\" in 2002 and started playing in some smaller Legnano clubs and at high school parties. In 2003 the members change the band's name from \\"Junkies\\" to \\"Finley\\", inspired from the NBA player Michael Finley who was, at that time, the basketball star of the Dallas Mavericks. That year they self produce their first video for \\"Make up your own mind\\", directed by their friend, Marco Lamanna. =Claudio Cecchetto and Tutto √® possibile (2005‚Äì2006)= Thanks to their first single \\"Make up your own mind\\" the band caught the attention of Italy's most famous producer Claudio Cecchetto, founder of Radio Deejay (one of the most important radio stations in Italy) and producer of some of the most known Italian artists in recent years: Jovanotti, 883 and many others. Finley started working with him and played as the opening act for Max Pezzali shows in Milan and Rome, before audiences of 20.000 people. In 2005 Claudio Cecchetto produced Finley's first single \\"Tutto √® possibile\\", the Italian language version of \\"Make up your own mind\\". The debut of the single occurred in November 2005 on Mtv Italy. A few days after that, the band unexpectedly showed up under Mtv Trl studios during the live recording of the program, showing at the cameras a poster that displays the writing \\"Thank you!\\". As time goes by Finley became the representative band for Mtv and, in addition to this, the four guys worked for a certain period as hosts for Mtv Trl and other Mtv programs. The band signs a contract with EMI/Capitol Italy and publishes its first studio album \\"Tutto √® possibile\\", recorded and mixed by their friend and artistic producer Daniele Persoglio, and released on 31 March 2006. The album has a fresh and new sound in Italian soundscape and gets much attention: at this point a long tour started and, day by day, an increasing number of people showed up at the concerts and filled the clubs where the band performs. In summer Finley release the second single \\"Diventerai Una Star\\" thanks to which the album slowly rises up the Italian charts and became a platinum record with over 80,000 copies sold. The success leads the band on some big stages: Coca-Cola live@Mtv, where the band opens Pink's show, and Heineken Jammin Festival where Finley share the stage with Depeche Mode and Morrisey. During a rehearsal session in one of the biggest studios in Milan the guys meet Mondo Marcio, a new Italian rapper who has recently published his first record. Finley recorded a rock version of his hit titled \\"Dentro Alla scatola\\": this featuring brings the single at the top of all TVs and radios charts. To crown it all, Mtv gives the band a nomination as Best Italian Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006, along with artists such as Lacuna Coil, Tiziano Ferro, and Jovanotti. On 27 November 2006 Finley won the award. A few days after that, the band released a ri-edition of its first record in a cd-DVD version, which became a double platinum record selling over 160,000 copies. The tour is sold out and two more singles are released on winter: \\"Sole di settembre\\" and \\"Fumo e cenere\\". Finley tours Italy non-stop all year round, performing over 100 shows during 2006. The last concert of this tour takes place in a club called \\"Alcatraz\\" in Milan, where tickets sold out in just a few hours. =Adrenalina and European tour (2007‚Äì2008)= During the first few months of 2007 the band dedicated itself to the writing of the second studio album Adrenalina. The album, produced by Claudio Cecchetto and EMI/Capitol, is registered and mixed by Michele Canova, a sound engineer and artistic producer who works with artists such as Tiziano Ferro and Eros Ramazzotti. Adrenalina sees the light on June 15, 2007 and debuts at number two in Italy, drag by the homonymous single. In summer a new tour starts and the band is called to play in the most important European festivals. They played at Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park festivals in Germany, sharing the stage with Korn, Velvet Revolver, Good Charlotte, Paolo Nutini and The Kooks, in Hyde Park, London, for the Wireless Festival with The White Stripes, Air, Queens of the Stone Age and in Sweden for the Pier Pressure, playing as opening act for My Chemical Romance and Avril Lavigne. Mtv Italy followed the band on this tour in order to create a video-documentary to broadcast on TV in the following weeks. Italian tour goes ahead too and, at the end of summer, Finley played at the \\"MTV day\\", the tenth anniversary of MTV Italy, which took place in Rome in front of over 70,000 people. The second single from Adrenalina titled \\"Domani\\" is released in October and the album becomes a gold record. In 2008 Finley had been called to join the Sanremo Music Festival's cast with the song \\"Ricordi\\". The English version of the song titled \\"Your Hero\\" is recorded with the famous Latin- American singer Belinda, nominated in 2004 for the Best female album at Billboard Latin Music Awards and in 2005 as best pop artist at MTV Video Music Awards Latin America. During this seven-day festival, the band released \\"Adrenalina 2\\", an extended version of \\"Adrenalina\\" that charted and became the most sold record of that month. Adrenalina reaches the platinum records status and in May 2008 a new tour starts. In autumn Finley received another nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards and they won the Best Italian Act for the second time in November. =Band at work and Fuori (2009‚Äì2011)= Finley is recognized as a pioneer of a new kind of rock in Italy, has paved the way for many bands inspired by their sound. During the writing of their third album, the band felt the need to experiment with a new sound, and turned to their long-term friend and artistic producer Daniele Persoglio, who recorded their first record. Finley went back into the studio and after a few months released a new EP titled \\"Band at work\\" whose first single \\"Gruppo Randa\\" became a very important song for the band. Gruppo randa becomes a symbol, an anthem for all the fans that, under the name of \\"Randa\\", identified themselves in a movement, a philosophy of life. Finley went through various types of sounds and different contents in the lyrics comparing them to the first two album's songs. They create a sort of transition album that is going, from here on, to change their entire sound and the way the band writes and compose. This third studio album is titled \\"Fuori!\\" and is published on 30 March 2010 with Claudio Cecchetto, Pierpaolo Peroni and EMI/Capitol, recorded and arranged by Marco Barusso and Daniele Persoglio and mixed by Marco Barusso. The album debuted at nine in Italy and the band launches it through a film-clip, a short film made by the five singles' videos connected each other's by the same story. The five songs are \\"Fuori!\\", \\"Un'altra come te\\", \\"Il tempo di un minuto\\", \\"In orbita\\" and \\"Meglio di noi non-c'√® niente\\". That's an absolute innovation within Italian videoclips: Finley has a great attention to the direction of their videos and they're very tied to this channel of communication. In September the band has been asked from Disney to reinterpret the soundtrack for ‚ÄúCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam\\", they write \\"Per la vita che verr√†\\", the Italian version of \\"I wouldn't change a thing\\", the original song by Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas. In the second half of 2010, two significant facts occur: at first Ste, the bass player, decided to leave the band to start his personal new projects. Daniele Persoglio temporary took his place as bass player. The second fact is the encounter with Edoardo Bennato, the progenitor in the sixties/seventies of rock music in Italy. The first time that the band and him met each other was backstage at a concert: they then decided to go together on stage and to play together their hits: ‚ÄúLe ragazze fanno grandi sogni‚Äù and \\"Fumo e cenere\\". A strong sinergy immediately born between them and leaves a deep mark in the artistic path of the band. Edoardo Bennato asked Finley to take part in his new live DVD ‚ÄúMtv Classic Storytellers‚Äù, with many other important Italian artists: Roy Paci, Giuliano Palma & the Bluebeaters and Morgan. In 2011 Finley took part also to the CD soundtrack for the Fox animation movie \\"Rio\\", with the song \\"Carnevale\\". In September the band decide to have a long break in order to enter the studio and write the new songs for the fourth album with no pressure and with all the time they needed. During this period they created a new way to keep in contact and interact with the fans: ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù. This is a free e-diary written and published on the band website day by day where the members write their thoughts, considerations, stories, and everything about the creation of their new songs and the life in the studio. The diary has a great success and became a video diary after some months. In the second episode of this video diary the band announced that the fourth album will be recorded and mixed by Guido Style, frontman of the rock'n'roll band The Styles, famous producer and guitarist who plays with big Italian stars J-Ax and Biagio Antonacci. In the fifth episode the band officially introduced the new bassist, Ivan, who's going to give the band new ideas, new energies and a definitive sound growth. =Gruppo Randa: Finley's independent label - Fuoco e fiamme and Sempre solo noi (2012)= 2012 is a year of revolution for Finley: first of all, with the entrance of the new bass player Ivan, they are back to their original lineup asset. He actively contributes to the growth and evolution of Finley music. The band's now ready for a very important and delicate phase of its career. At this point the special partnership with Claudio Cecchetto and EMI ends up: Finley decided to drastically change direction and, with their manager Omar Pedretti, try themselves out founding their own independent label: Gruppo randa. The fact of the matter is that the guys don't believe anymore in the traditional model of work proper of the big major labels. Finley wanted a more dynamic and fast structure under their own control. On 29 May 2012 the band released ‚ÄúFuoco e fiamme‚Äù, the fourth studio album, which is the first published under Gruppo Randa records. The album, with the first single ‚ÄúFuego‚Äù, debuts at the first place in the independent Italian chart and at the sixth in the FIMI/Nielsen chart. This record is characterized by a radical changing comparing to the past works. The new sound thanks to Ivan and Guido Style appears completely refreshed and revolutionized. ‚ÄúFuoco e fiamme‚Äù is made by thirteen rock, powerful songs. The album presents the fire as symbol of recognition, passion and friendship inside all the lyrics and in the graphics too. Once again the band cooperated with Edoardo Bennato who, thanks to his voice and harp, made the single \\"Il meglio arriver√†\\", one of the more precious songs of the band. To this day this single is the one with the highest number of radio broadcasting in Finley history. In August, Finley published the single \\"Olympia (the sound of my nation)\\", a song dedicated to the 2012 Olympic Games, which is chosen by the Italian Boxing Team as its official soundtrack. The video is shot with the participation of some boxing stars: the bronze medal winner Vincenzo Mangiacapre and other olympic contendent like Domenico Valentino, Vincenzo Picardi, Vittorio Parrinello and Manuel Cappai. In September, a new sport talk show called \\"Undici\\" starts on the Italian TV Mediaset. The homonymous song written by Finley becomes the theme song of this program. On 9 November 2012 Fuoco e fiamme tour starts from Rome and on 4 December 2012 they release \\"Sempre solo noi\\". ‚ÄúSempre solo noi\\" is the fifth studio album of the band, the second one published by Gruppo Randa. It is a limited edition record which celebrated the 10th birthday of the band that formed in 2002. The first single \\"Un giorno qualunque\\" is put online on Finley website on Christmas Day. The album is made of seven new intense songs and it can be considered the most personal and emotional work of Finley, a work that they want to dedicate to the fans that follow and supported them since 2002. As a matter of fact the band put into the album a poster which displayed all the fan photographs as a sign of recognition. Finley cooperated at the end of the year in the recordings of PGA album (Italian punks go acoustic...for good!) with a cover of \\"I fought the law\\" by the Clash. The project, born in 2010 from an idea of the musician and Virgin radio speaker Andrea Rock. Pga is the first album of over 30 Italian punk-rock musicians, playing acoustic covers of historical rock songs, in order to help a charitable association called \\"L'isola che non-c'√®‚Äù =Work for Lego and recent activities (2013 ‚Äì present)= In 2013, Finley wrote three songs for Lego Legends of Chima, an animated cartoon series, modeled after the Lego product line of the same name. The title song produced for the series was titled as \\"Unleash the Power\\". This is their first collaboration for an international audience. Two other songs, \\"Day of Glory\\" and \\"Horizon\\", were also recorded for the series. All three tracks were available as free downloads on the Legends of Chima website. The band still continues to remain active despite not having released a new album. On May 17, 2019, Finley released the live album We Are Finleyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezsAQ2DQQuo, along with the single \\"San Diego\\" being released shortly after.

The picture was O'Brien's last starring role and the only feature film released during Shemp Howard's second tenure with the trio. Plot As peddlers, the Three Stooges help insurance agent George O'Brien outwit a gang of desperados who are after a valuable gold-mine shipment, led by local bigwig Sawyer (Lyle Talbot). Production notes Gold Raiders was an attempt by independent producer Bernard Glasser to inaugurate a new western series starring George O'Brien, the lead in F. W. Murnau's 1927 masterpiece Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans and later a top star in Western and outdoor-adventure features. The Three Stooges, who consisted at that time of Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Shemp Howard appear with O'Brien. O'Brien and the Stooges receive roughly equal screen time. Gold Raiders marked the second and last feature film with Shemp Howard as part of the Stooges since the act's first screen appearance, the 1930 film Soup to Nuts, which also featured the Stooges' original leader Ted Healy. The 56-minute Gold Raiders was economically filmed in five days by director Edward Bernds, who also directed several of the Stooges' shorts. Filmed on December 26‚Äì30, 1950, Bernds later commented \\"I should have never made that picture. It was an ultra-quickie shot in five days at a cost of $50,000 ($ today), which, even then, was ridiculously low. I'm afraid the picture shows it!\\" It was originally released by independent producer Jack Schwarz through United Artists in 1951. Although the principals worked well together, plans to pursue an O'Brien-Stooges series were abandoned. The film was reissued to theaters in 1958, and television distributor AAP issued two home-movie abridgments on 8mm film in the 1960s.Solomon, Jon.

Biography  Bibiena was born on 18 August 1657 at Bologna. He was the son of painter Giovanni Maria Galli (1625‚Äì1665), and he studied painting under Carlo Cignani and architecture under Giulio Trogli, called il Paradosso. On recommendation of Cignani, Bibiena entered into the service of the duke of Parma, and he also worked for the Farnese dynasty at Piacenza during those 30 years. His main work during this period was the garden and villa of Colorno, but he soon earned a reputation for his scenic designs and began working for the theatre. In 1708, Bibiena was called to Barcelona to organize the decorations in connection with the wedding festivities of the future Holy Roman emperor Charles VI. When this prince became the Emperor, Bibiena traveled to Vienna, where he worked on designs of scenery and decorations for court festivities and opera performances. In his decorations for the theatre and festivities, Bibiena replaced the central (vertical) axis with a diagonal axis, introducing an angular perspective along the diagonal. In the competition to select a design for the construction of the Karlskirche, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach was chosen over Bibiena as the architect. He returned to Bologna in 1716, where in 1717, he was elected as a member of the Clementine Academy. In 1731, Bibiena built the royal theatre of Mantua (which burned 50 years later, in 1781). He produced several books, including: :* L'Architettura civile (1711; \\"Civil Architecture\\"), later reissued under various titles :* Varie opere di prospettiva (1703‚Äì1708; \\"Various Works of Perspective\\"). Past the age of 86, Bibiena died on January 3, 1743.  Family  The Galli-Bibiena family derives its name from the surname and birthplace of papa Giovanni Maria Galli (1625‚Äì1665), who was born at Bibbiena (Italy) outside Florence. Giovanni studied painting under Francesco Albani and laid the foundations of an artistry which was continued by his descendants, who dedicated themselves to scenic work (with set design) for the theatre. For example, Ferdinando's second son, Antonio, was well regarded, like his father, as a pittore scenico or teatrale, active in the arts of arte scenografica.Caimi, page 113 Using the highly ornate style of late Baroque sculpture and architecture, the members of the Galli-Bibiena family produced a series of theatrical and other designs that are exceptional for their intricate splendour and spacious proportions achieved by detailed perspective. Among their followers was Francesco Zinani of Reggio Emilia. From about 1690 to 1787, eight Bibienas designed and painted for many of the courts of Europe with intricate settings for operas, weddings, and funerals. The Habsburgs were their most generous patrons. Among his followers or artists in his studio was Domenico Francia. Notes  References  * A. H. Mayor, The Bibiena Family, 1940.

Marriott was an heir of John Marriott of Severn who settled in Anne Arundel County in 1664. The land was originally part of a large section of land patented by Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Waverley slave plantation occupied a significant portion of the land which was known as the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. The village was home to a magnesium limestone quarry, and was known for farms such as \\"Prospect Hill\\", and School Board member Henry O. Devries (1826-1902) farm. On 22 March 1836, a railroad car derailed on a demonstration of the new railroad technology with 40 city leaders on board. In 1866, Reese's Mill was washed out by regional flooding. From 1965 to 1974, large tracts of Marriottsville once known as Alpha were purchased by land speculators anticipating development. In 1977 County Executive Edward L. Cochran chose Marriottsville for a landfill site. Alpha Ridge Landfill opened in May 1980. An expansion plan proposed by Charles I. Ecker was suspended after contamination of groundwater was reported, which brought public water extensions, followed by density increases approved by the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning for land development.

A former deputy editor of The Tablet and later Director for Public Affairs of the former Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, he frequently appears on radio and TV programmes to comment in stories involving the Church. He is Fellow in Contemporary Church History at Campion Hall, Oxford. Austen Ivereigh, author and commentator Ivereigh is the founder and coordinator of Catholic Voices, which trains people to put the Catholic Church's case in the media, and regularly contributes to a number of magazines and newspapers such as America, Our Sunday Visitor, and The Guardian. For many years he has been connected to Citizens UK (formerly London Citizens) as the first leader of the \\"Strangers into Citizens\\" campaign, and was for a time lead organiser of West London Citizens. He is author of Faithful Citizens: a practical guide to community organising and Catholic social teaching, Catholic Voices: putting the Church's case in an era of 24-hour news, both published by Darton, Longman & Todd, and How to Defend the Faith Without Raising Your Voice (Our Sunday Visitor Press, 2012). Education and Writing Ivereigh was educated at the Benedictine public school, Worth, and was, briefly, a novice member of the Society of Jesus. In 1989 he joined St Antony's College, Oxford, as a postgraduate student. In 1993 he completed a D.Phil. thesis for the University of Oxford titled Catholicism and Politics in Argentina: An Interpretation, with Special Reference to the Period 1930-1960, later published as Catholicism and Politics in Argentina, 1810-1960. He has been Deputy Editor of The Tablet, editorial adviser to The Way, and associate editor of Godspy. He currently writes for America magazine's \\"In All Things\\" blog, while also contributing regularly to America magazine, Our Sunday Visitor, The Tablet, The Spectator, and others. In 2014, Ivereigh published The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope, a biography of Pope Francis. Hugh O'Shaughnessy wrote in The Observer, \\"Dr Ivereigh‚Äôs exhaustive book on the first pope from the New World follows Paul Vallely‚Äôs excellent Pope Francis: Untying the Knots, in making better known the life and thoughts of this son of Italian immigrants to Buenos Aires.\\" In The Washington Post, Elizabeth Tenety wrote, \\"In pushing the church forward, Francis today insists that 'God is not afraid of new things' and that the complexities of human life are not necessarily black and white. 'Jorge Bergoglio‚Äôs radicalism comes from his willingness to go to the essentials, to pare back to the Gospel,' Ivereigh writes. Francis found his way to the essentials while putting in place the post-Vatican II spiritual renewal in his Jesuit order by focusing on 'poverty, holiness, missionary focus, obedience to the pope and unity.' During his time as provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina, he attempted to reorient a politically charged church culture toward the spirituality of everyday holiness.\\" Ivereigh followed up with a second biography in 2019: Wounded Shepherd: Pope Francis and His Struggle to Convert the Catholic Church. Work for the Archbishop of Westminster In October 2004, Ivereigh was appointed press secretary to the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, working alongside his public affairs adviser, Sir Stephen Wall. After Sir Stephen's departure in May 2005, Ivereigh was appointed director for public affairs, a role which combined both positions. Argentinian newspaper.

The allegations were the subject of legal proceedings initiated by Ivereigh in the High Court of Justice against Associated Newspapers Ltd. (ANL). A trial in February 2008 was inconclusive, but at the retrial in January 2009 the jury unanimously found that Ivereigh had been libeled. He was awarded ¬£30,000 in damages, and all costs, estimated at ¬£3m. Ivereigh said his reputation had been \\"comprehensively vindicated\\". Awarding costs against the Daily Mail, Justice Eady said that Ivereigh had achieved an ‚Äúunqualified victory‚Äù against the newspaper's ‚Äúintransigence‚Äù, and had done so ‚Äúin light of the sneering, belittling of his personality and his character made by the defendant‚Äù.

In his 11-year career, Ruether played for the Chicago Cubs, the Cincinnati Reds, the Brooklyn Robins, the Washington Senators, and the New York Yankees. He appeared in the 1919 World Series with the Reds, in the 1925 World Series with the Senators, and in the 1926 World Series with the Yankees. Ruether was also a member of the 1927 Yankees. Though that team played in the 1927 World Series, Ruether did not participate in any of the games.  Early life  Ruether attended St. Ignatius College. On March 10, 1913, St. Ignatius participated in an exhibition game against the Chicago White Sox. Ruether, a left-hander, pitched in the game for St. Ignatius. In the ninth-inning, White Sox shortstop Buck Weaver hit a 3-run home run off Ruether. This secured the victory for the White Sox, and Ruether lost the contest 4‚Äì2. Ruether parlayed his strong outing into a try-out with the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. After reporting to Hot Springs, Arkansas for the Pirates' training camp, he signed a contract. The contract stated that Ruether could opt out if the Pirates attempted to assign him to a Minor league farm team. The Pirates did just that, and consequently, Ruether left the organization. After he left the Pirates, Ruether went to play in the Northwest League. He spent the 1914 season and the 1915 season with the Vancouver Beavers.Vancouver Baseball (retrieved 15 May 2015) mentions only 1915. In 1916, Ruether moved to the Spokane Indians. That team went on to win the pennant.  Major League career  In 1917, Ruether signed with the Chicago Cubs. He made his Major League debut in April of that year. After he had appeared in 10 games for the Cubs, the Cincinnati Reds selected Ruether off waivers on July 17, 1917. After finishing the 1917 season, Ruether enlisted in the United States Army due to the break out of World War I. He reported to Camp Lewis. In 1919, Ruether rejoined the Reds. He won nineteen games that season and the Reds made the 1919 World Series. Though Cincinnati won the series, it has become infamous for the Black Sox Scandal. Ruether spent the 1920 season with the Reds. On December 15 of that year, the Reds traded Ruether to the Brooklyn Robins in exchange for Rube Marquard. He spent the next four seasons as a pitcher for the Robins. During the 1924 season, Ruether suffered from arm problems. After an apparent dispute with Charles Ebbets, the Robins owner, the Washington Senators purchased Ruether from the Robins. Ruether spent the next year and a half with the Senators before the team traded him to the New York Yankees on August 27, 1926 While with the Senators, Ruether appeared in the 1925 World Series. Although he was a pitcher, Ruether did not pitch in the series. Instead, he was used as a pinch hitter and recorded one at-bat. For his career, Ruether was a good hitting pitcher with a .258 batting average and 250 career hits. The Yankees earned a spot in the 1926 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, and Ruether pitched in game three. The game did not go well for Ruether. The Cardinals won 4‚Äì0. In 1927, Ruether played for his third consecutive pennant winning team. However, Ruether did not appear in the 1927 World Series. The 1927 season was his last in the Major Leagues. Ruether recorded 137 wins and 95 losses, for a .591 winning percentage. Ruether holds the National League record for most innings pitched in a season opening game.

In 1934, Ruether retired from active play and joined the Seattle Indians as the team manager. The league voted Ruether the All-star team manager in his first year. Ruether left the league in 1936. Later in his life, Ruether served as a scout for the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. He helped discover players such as Joey Amalfitano, Eddie Bressoud, Peanuts Lowrey and Mike McCormick.

In other sports he worked with such outstanding coaches as Dick Erickson and Bob Ernst in crew, Earl Ellis in swimming, Dr. Eric Hughes in gymnastics, Ken Shannon in track and field, the legendary Danny Litwhiler in baseball, Joe Baum in soccer, and Amo Bessone and Ron Mason in ice hockey. Bessone and Mason both won NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championships, with Mason retiring with the all-time highest number of wins in Division One ice hockey. Mason was the athletic director at Michigan State University until his retirement in early 2008, when he was succeeded by Mark Hollis, who was basketball team manager on Jud Heathcote's staff at Michigan State and on Kearney's staff at the Western Athletic Conference. Honors In 1991, Joe Kearney was nominated by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) to be its recipient of the Corbett Award, which is the highest honor in university sports administration. The Western Athletic Conference presents the Joe Kearney Award to the top male and female athlete each year‚Äîan award that has been given annually since the 1991‚Äì92 academic year. In July 2014, Kearney was selected for induction into the University of Washington Husky Hall of Fame. Further, in May 2020, Kearney was inducted into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame for his long career in high-school and university athletics within the state. Later life and family Kearney retired to Tucson, Arizona and lived there for 16 years with his wife, Dorothea Kearney (born January 3, 1927 in Shelton, Washington, deceased February 5, 2011 in Denver, Colorado). He was the father of five children (Jan Veile, Kevin Kearney, Erin Leary, Shawn Bassham and Robin Kearney) and had eleven grandchildren (Christopher Kearney; Katie Kearney; Nicholas Kearney; Emma Kearney; Ryan Kearney; Aaron Bassham; Seth Bassham; Graham Veile; Laurel Howard; Trey Howard and Adrianne Leary). Kearney died on May 5, 2010 in Tucson, after an eight-month battle with pancreatic cancer.

It has been developed in the context of statistical mechanics, where it has come to have a particular significance.  Introduction  If a and b are two real numbers, then the exponential of a+b is the product of the exponential of a with the exponential of b: : e^{a+b} = e^a e^b . This relationship is not true if we replace a and b with symmetric/hermitian square matrices A and B. Golden and Thompson proved that, while the matrix given by e^{A+B} is not always equal to the matrix given by e^A e^B, their traces are related by the following inequality: : \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\, e^{A+B} \\\\le \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left(e^A e^B\\\\right). The inequality is well defined as the expression on right hand side of the inequality is a positive real number, as can be seen by rewriting it as \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(e^{\\\\frac{A}{2}}e^B e^{\\\\frac{A}{2}}\\\\right) (using the cyclic property of the trace). If A and B commute, then the equality e^{A+B} = e^A e^B holds, just like in the case of real number. In this situation the Golden-Thompson inequality is actually an equality. proved that this is the only situation in which this happens: if A and B are two Hermitian matrices for which the Golden-Thomposon inequality is verified as an equality, then the two matrices commute.  Generalizations  The inequality has been generalized to three matrices by and furthermore to any arbitrary number of hermitian matrices by . For three matrices, it takes the following formulation: : \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\, e^{A+B+C} \\\\le \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left(e^A \\\\mathcal{T}_{e^{-B}} e^C\\\\right) where the operator \\\\mathcal{T}_f is the derivative of the matrix logarithm given by \\\\mathcal{T}_f(g) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\operatorname{d}t \\\\, (f+t)^{-1} g (f+t)^{-1} . Note that, if f and g commute, then \\\\mathcal{T}_f(g) = gf^{-1}, and the inequality for three matrices reduces to the original from Golden and Thompson. used the Kostant convexity theorem to generalize the Golden‚ÄìThompson inequality to all compact Lie groups.

The picture is a remake of the 1933 German film Happy Days in Aranjuez. The screenplay was written by Samuel Hoffenstein, Edwin Justus Mayer and Waldemar Young based on the play Die Sch√∂nen Tage von Aranjuez by Hans Sz√©kely and Robert A. Stemmle. The music score was composed by Frederick Hollander and the cinematography was shot by Charles Lang and Victor Milner. Marlene Dietrich's wardrobe was designed by Travis Banton. The supporting cast features John Halliday, William Frawley, Akim Tamiroff, and Alan Mowbray. Plot In Paris, Madeleine de Beaupre (Marlene Dietrich) cons jeweler Aristide Duvalle (Ernest Cossart) and psychiatrist Maurice Pauquet (Alan Mowbray) by telling each man that she is married to the other. Duvalle delivers a string of pearls worth millions of francs to Pauquet's office, expecting to be paid, but Pauquet thinks he is a new patient who has delusions of needing to collect debts. Madeleine is there to introduce them to each other, and departs with the pearls before they figure out what she has done. While driving to the Spanish border, Madeleine splashes mud onto Tom Bradley (Gary Cooper), an American automotive engineer vacationing in Europe. Then as they approach the border, her car's horn control sticks \\"on\\", to the annoyance of the customs officers. Tom fixes it and they go into the office together. Luggage and purses are being inspected, so she decides to hide the pearls in his jacket pocket. On the road, she pulls ahead of Tom, then disables her own car so that he will have to give her a lift. But he has changed jackets. She says she is going to San Sebasti√°n, and he offers to drive her there. En route she seizes an opportunity to steal his car, leaving him standing in the road‚Äîalong with the suitcase his other jacket is in. She then crashes the car while evading police. They make their way separately to San Sebasti√°n. There \\"Countess\\" de Beaupre meets her accomplice, supposedly her uncle, \\"Prince\\" Carlos Margoli (John Halliday). Tom locates Madeleine with the help of a policeman (Akim Tamiroff), who cannot imagine that a charming countess would steal a car and does not even stay to see if Tom identifies her as the thief. As it seems that Tom still has the pearls but does not know it, Carlos quickly offers to pay for the car, and Madeleine pretends to be attracted to him. They all become friendly and go together to stay at Carlos's villa. There, when Tom wears his other jacket, Carlos gets the pearls from him using another trick. Carlos now wants Madeleine to accompany him to Madrid to sell them, but she has actually fallen in love with Tom, and wants to leave the gang instead. Despite the attempts of Carlos and \\"Aunt\\" Olga (Zeffie Tilbury), another gang member, to break them up, they become engaged. After Carlos and Olga taunt Madeleine about being unable to tell Tom the truth about herself, she throws caution to the wind and does just that. They steal the necklace back from Carlos and return to Paris, where Madeleine returns it to Duvalle. He personally forgives her, but says she must still face the authorities. The final scene is Tom and Madeleine's wedding, where her parole document is accidentally shown, proving that she has done so. Pauquet and Duvalle, who now is his patient, attend the wedding as witnesses. Cast * Marlene Dietrich as Madeleine de Beaupre * Gary Cooper as Tom Bradley * John Halliday as Carlos Margoli * William Frawley as Mr. Gibson * Ernest Cossart as Aristide Duvalle * Akim Tamiroff as Avilia, Police Official * Alan Mowbray as Dr. Maurice Pauquet * Zeffie Tilbury as Aunt Olga Background John Gilbert was initially cast as Carlos Margoli, which was to be his comeback role. He had a heart attack in his dressing room a few weeks later and was immediately replaced by John Halliday. A few days later, Gilbert died of alcohol-induced heart failure. Some of the scenes in the film were directed by Ernst Lubitsch whilst Frank Borzage was fulfilling a prior commitment at Warner Bros. The film was shot at Paramount Studios and at the Iverson Movie Ranch, Chatsworth, California and, unusual for its time, on location in France and Spain. Of the film, Dietrich said: :The only film I need not be ashamed of is Desire, directed by Frank Borzage and based on a script by Ernst Lubitsch. I found Gary Cooper a little less monosyllabic than before. He was finally rid of Lupe V√©lez, who had been at his heels constantly throughout the shooting of Morocco. and: :Desire became a good film and, moreover, also proved to be a box-office success. The script was excellent, the roles superb - one more proof that these elements are more important than actors.Marlene Dietrich web site. Accolades Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, describing it as \\"the best film in which Miss Marlene Dietrich has appeared since she left Germany, and the most amusing new film to be seen in London this week\\".

Born in Wales, Ontario, Blackburn worked as a newspaper reporter for the Ottawa Journal in Pembroke, Ontario.George Blackburn - Obituary Ottawa Citizen, November 16‚Äì18, 2006, (retrieved 11/21/2012) This is a copy of the obituary for George G. Blackburn that was sent to the newspapers announcing his passing: OBITUARY FOR GEORGE G. BLACKBURN \\"Peacefully, in his sleep, at 11:11 a.m. November 15, 2006, in his 90th year at Ottawa ‚Äôs General Hospital where he‚Äôd been diagnosed with cancer. Predeceased by his wife of 60 years Grace Fortington, four years ago. Survived by three children, daughter Andrea of Tallahassee, Florida, his sons Mark of Winnipeg and Ron of Ottawa . George G. Blackburn is also survived by grandchildren Kim, David, Aaron, Ben, and Maxine, and by great-grandchildren Victoria, Matthew, Thomas, Emily, Lochlan, Madeleine and Luke. A man of many talents, he suddenly found himself, late in life, with hundreds of new friends from around the world after authoring a World War II book trilogy, the first of which \\"Guns of Normandy,\\" was winner ten years ago of the Ottawa Citizen Book of the Year Award (1996). The books provided a first hand account of Canadian soldiers in action but did not include details of how the author, as a young artillery officer, was awarded the Military Cross for helping save a key bridgehead at the Twente Canal in the Netherlands, on April 3 and 4, 1945. Blackburn's other World War II medals included 1939‚Äì1945 Star; France & Germany Star; Defence Medal; War Medal; Canadian Volunteer Service Medal. Late-in-life he was awarded the Order of Canada and the French Legion of Honour. Blackburn's literary awards include the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction; the Ottawa Citizen Book of the Year Award and a Trillium Award jury citation that Guns of Normandy \\"May well contain the greatest Canadian memories of World War II.\\" Earlier awards included honours for plays and films of note. After a pre-war stint as reporter for the Ottawa Journal in Pembroke, Captain George Blackburn returned from Europe to serve as Director of Information and Director of Fair Employment Practices, for the Federal Department of Labour. Starting in the 1950s he became producer of the longest- running radio show \\"Canada at Work\\", as well as an award-winning documentary film script writer, which films included topics on the Older Worker; Anti- Discrimination; a film starring Wayne & Schuster called \\"You Can Go a Long Way\\", encouraging teenagers to stay in high school rather than drop out and the country‚Äôs most successful government campaign, \\"Why Wait for Spring? Do It Now!\\" Winter Works Campaign, which revolutionized winter construction and employment during the winter months. Born in 1917 in a farmhouse near Wales Ontario, a village which disappeared beneath the waters of the St. Lawrence Seaway, George Blackburn would later commemorate the ‚Äòsaga of the Seaway‚Äô in his musical play \\"A Day to Remember\\" whose songs were among hundreds, for which he composed words and music. His musical was professionally performed for two summers, at a theatre of his own creation, near Upper Canada Village. His last expressed wish was that \\"young people be made aware of the sacrifice made by (generations of) soldiers on behalf of Canadian freedom.\\" Only weeks ago, he‚Äôd made his final, annual visit to Manitoba‚Äôs Camp Shilo ‚Äì to address Canada‚Äôs young artillery officers. On a personal note, George Blackburn never \\"talked the talk\\" of organized religion ‚Äì though he believed in a creator God but he \\"walked the walk\\" never allowing anyone to 'pick up the tab' at any event he attended and providing a lifelong banquet for widows and others who could never repay him in kind. A great man, profoundly missed by those who survive him. A memorial service will be held at Pinecrest Cemetery, Saturday November 18 at 2 o‚Äôclock, 2006.\\" Military service George Blackburn joined the Canadian Army in 1940, becoming a forward observation officer. He fought in the Battle of Normandy. Blackburn was awarded his Military Cross in 1944 for his role in defending the Twente Canal bridgehead in the Netherlands. Blackburn returned to Ottawa after the war and found work as a journalist and with the Canadian Department of Labour as Director of Information as well as Director of Fair Employment Practices. He wrote a musical jingle, well known in Canada during the 1960s, Why Wait for Spring? Do It Now, that encouraged home owners to have home improvements done during winter. He was producer for a radio show, Canada at Work and also wrote a musical play, A Day to Remember, about the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, an event that permanently submerged his home town. Writing career Blackburn wrote a trilogy of books based on his war-time experiences: The Guns of Normandy: A Soldier's Eye View, France 1944 The Guns of Victory: A Soldier's Eye View, Belgium, Holland, and Germany, 1944-45, and Where the Hell Are the Guns?: A Soldier's View of the Anxious Years, 1939‚Äì44. The Guns of Normandy received the \\"Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction\\" in 1996.Wilfrid Laurier University 1996: George G.

Claiborne is also a social activist, advocating for nonviolence and service to the poor. He is the author of the book, The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical. Biography Claiborne grew up in east Tennessee. His father, who was a Vietnam War veteran, died when Shane was 9 years old. A graduate of Eastern University, where he studied sociology and youth ministry, Claiborne did his final academic work for Eastern University at Wheaton College in Illinois. While at Wheaton, Claiborne did an internship at Willow Creek Community Church. He has done some graduate work at Princeton Theological Seminary, but took a leave of absence, and now is a part of The Alternative Seminary in Philadelphia. Claiborne worked alongside Mother Teresa during a 10-week term in Calcutta. He has written about how his work with Mother Teresa impacted him and made him realize the need to support a consistent life ethic, to protect all human life from conception to natural death. He spent three weeks in Baghdad with the Iraq Peace Team (IPT), a project of Voices in the Wilderness and Christian Peacemaker Teams. He was witness to the military bombardment of Baghdad as well as the militarized areas between Baghdad and Amman. As a member of IPT, Claiborne took daily trips to sites where there had been bombings, visited hospitals and families, and attended worship services during the war. He also continues to serve as a board member for the nationwide Christian Community Development Association which was founded by the authors and community developers, John Perkins and Wayne Gordon. On June 20, 2007, a seven-alarm fire at the abandoned warehouse across the street destroyed The Simple Way Community Center where Claiborne lived. He lost all of his possessions in the fire. The Simple Way immediately set up funds to accept donations to help those who lost their homes in the fire. Claiborne is featured in the documentary The Ordinary Radicals, and co- directed the three volume Another World is Possible DVD series. Claiborne wrote the foreword to Ben Lowe's 2009 book Green Revolution: Coming Together to Care for Creation. In 2011 he has appeared as both a guest and co-host of the TV show \\"Red Letter Christians\\" with Tony Campolo. That year also, he declared his unwillingness to pay taxes to fund U.S. military activity.

Life Herman was born in Woerden to a family of thriving artisans whose ancestors included the famous painter Lucas van Leyden. The identity of Swanevelt‚Äôs teacher remains a mystery. A new hypothesis suggests that he was a pupil of Willem Buytewech. He painted his first signed and dated works in 1623 in Paris. In 1629 he moved to Rome, where he painted many landscapes, and introduced a new type of idyllic landscape with sunlit 'contrejours' reflecting the times of day. Swanevelt became a member of the Bentvueghels; his alias was \\"heremiet\\", while he preferred to work alone.From Landschap Erfgoed Utrecht with detailed information in dutch Created and developed by Paul Bril and Cornelis van Poelenburch from 1600 onward, the genre of the ‚ÄúItalianate landscape‚Äù entered its classical phase in the 1630s with the advent of Swanevelt and his friends and contemporaries Pieter van Laer and Claude Lorrain. His paintings became very popular and the Barberini family, Pope Urban VIII and the Vatican offered him commissions, like in the monastery of Monte Cassino. Along with Lorrain and others, he also painted landscapes for Philip IV of Spain's new Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid.From The Web Gallery of Art, and their biography with information on his work in Spain In 1641 he returned to Paris, where he remained except for occasional visits to his birthplace Woerden. He became a member of the Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1651. He assisted in the decoration of the H√¥tel Lambert and made numerous drawings and etchings. From Abstract on his Etchings by Anne Charlotte Steland His patrons in France were Cardinal Richelieu and King Louis XIV. Swanevelt lived in Rue du Temple when he died. Art Huntsman at Rest During the beginning of the 1630s his development runs parallel to Claude's, and in some ways even anticipates it. During the thirties Swanevelt refined his idyllic landscape style. Swanevelt was an important link between the first generation of Dutch italianate painters, such as Cornelis van Poelenburch and Bartholomeus Breenbergh, and those of the second generation who imitated his monumental compositions and his treatment of southern sunlight.From the Utrecht Museum on Swanevelt in Dutch In the last decade of his life when Swanevelt made a few trips to Woerden, he also painted Dutch scenery, but with the typical southern sunlight.From the Woerden museum, with many details on Swanevelt, in dutch Works For a long time the only murals attributed to Swanevelt were the two lunettes in the sacristy of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, of which only one survived. Art historian Susan Russell proposed that a frieze with seven scenes from the life of the Old Testament's Joseph in the east wing of Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona was also painted by him.Susan Russell: Burlington Magazine, Vol. 139, No. 1128 (Mar., 1997), pp. 171-177 One of Swanevelt's etchings, \\"The Birth of Adonis,\\" (1654) resides in the Utah Museum of Fine Art's permanent collection.

Filmed on location in Bangkok, the story concerns a Hong Kong engineer (Chiang) who goes to Thailand to find his long-lost half-brother (Ti Lung), who is a Muay Thai boxer. Plot Fan Ko, an engineering architect in Hong Kong who is also highly skilled in martial arts, is called to the bedside of his dying father, who reveals that he long ago had an affair with a woman in Thailand, who bore him a son. He begs Fan Ko to go to Thailand and find the young man, and shows him an old photo, taken when the brother was perhaps 10 years old. But even then, the fierce-looking boy was training in the Thai martial art, Muay Thai, and sported a tattoo on his left arm of a ship's anchor and a swallow flying underneath. So Fan Ko catches a Cathay Pacific flight to Bangkok Airport and is met by a family friend and booked into a room at the Dusit Thani Hotel. Leaving behind the suit-and-tie of his job, he's dressed in the colorful fashions of the day. At that moment in Thailand, it is Songkran, the Thai new year, when revelers splash water on each other. However, at Lumphini Boxing Stadium, the atmosphere is decidedly less festive, as another young boxer has been killed in the ring by the current champion, Cannon, who is backed by the local Triad boss and a crooked fight promoter, Qiang-ren. Using tactics of intimidation and with crooked officials on their payroll, the mob keeps supplying fighters to face the brutal Cannon. Among them is Wenlie, who needs to raise money to pay for an operation for his sick mother, despite the objections of his girlfriend, Yulan. Fan Ko, meanwhile, is nosing around at Lumpini stadium, and thinks that a fighter named Miller may be his brother after he sees a large plywood cutout of the boxer and notices the anchor-and- bird tattoo. He asks a bystander, an old fighter-turned-alcoholic, what the man's name is. \\"People call him 'dead man',\\" the old drunk says, because he's the next to face Cannon. When Miller faces Cannon, Fan Ko tries in vain to stop the fight, and Miller is pummeled ‚Äì another fighter killed in the ring. Fan Ko checks the tattoo. It's a ship's anchor alright, but the bird flying underneath is an eagle. Miller was not his brother. By now Fan Ko has become acquainted with a young Thai woman named Mei-dai, who shows him more sights around Bangkok, including the Grand Palace. And, through his investigation around Lumpini stadium, he's met Wenlie, but he's not seen Wenlie's left arm. Then Wenlie gets in the ring against Cannon. Fan Ko is watching the fight and sees the tattoo on Wenlie's arm ‚Äì it's a ship's anchor with a swallow underneath. Wenlie is Fan Ko's brother. The fight against Cannon is a tough one, but Wenlie is a strong fighter and he comes back from a savage beating to win. Fan Ko runs up to the ringside and tells Wenlie that they are brothers. Miller's brother Misao kills Cannon after the match, incurring the wrath of the villains. They storm Wenlie's place when he is not at home and kidnap Misao. When the brothers are ambushed, the two brothers are formidable and beat down the thugs and the main stooge. He tells them that they have kidnapped Misao, so the two brothers go to fetch him. At the house, Misao is beaten and killed, and the two brothers face off against a large group of weapon wielding henchmen. Fan Ko takes on the goons while Wenlie faces Qiang- ren. When a henchman cuts Wenlie's arm, Fan Ke disembowels the man with his skills and the henchmen run off. Fan Ko takes on Qiang-ren and breaks the villain's leg, and the police arrive to arrest the villain.

It's part of the MTV Unplugged series and resulted in a tour, a CD, a DVD and a TV special broadcast by MTV on 22 May from that year. The show featured various guest performances, including Argentinian singer Fito P√°ez on \\"Go Back\\", Marisa Monte on \\"Flores\\", Jamaican Jimmy Cliff on \\"Querem Meu Sangue\\", and ex-Tit√£s singer Arnaldo Antunes on \\"O Pulso\\". P√°ez also sings and plays the piano on the DVD version of \\"Televis√£o\\", while the CD version (recorded in studio) is sung by guest Rita Lee and played by also guest Roberto de Carvalho. The CD also features a short version of \\"Cabe√ßa Dinossauro\\" sung by Marina Lima. Maria Beth√¢nia was also expected to perform a version of \\"Mis√©ria\\".  Conception and promotion  Despite it having been a radio and commercial success, the band rejected the idea of it being an album conceived with commercial interests. They said creating these versions for their own songs was a challenge. As vocalist and bassist Nando Reis said, \\"we had to prove that Tit√£s could be different from Tit√£s and still be as good as them\\". They were afraid of sounding \\"pathetic\\", but were happy with growing their audience and to be back on the radio. Reis said the work was \\"a relief. It is very important for a band of this size to be popular. We have no underground vocation. I have no vocation to perform for half a dozen people. This does not mean to make the work mediocre\\". The album was also thought of as a celebration of the band's 15th anniversary. In order to carry all musicians involved with the project from one performance to another, the band would travel on two buses. The last performances of the tour took place in 4 and 5 April 1998, at Olympia in S√£o Paulo. These only happened after much requests from the fans, since the tour was supposed to end on 14 March at Ibirapuera Park, after 140 shows. In these last performances, the band already presented to the public their version of \\"√â Preciso Saber Viver\\", a hit from their then future album Volume Dois, which they were conceiving at the time. In 2019, amidst the band's \\"Trio Ac√∫stico\\" tour, which celebrated 20 years of Ac√∫stico MTV, Britto said the band was surprised by that time with the success of the album: \\"Many people bet on this idea that our songs would succeed, while others thought they wouldn't match. We ourselves had some doubts. [...] Yet, I feel that when the album came out we were surprised with the speed and the reach it had in terms of popularity. Our audience went through a radical renewal. We started playing to very young audiences and to an increasing number of women. Maybe we were the most popular group of that year, taking all genres into account.\\"  Song information  Apart from tracks taken from every album by the band until then (except for Tudo Ao Mesmo Tempo Agora (1991) and Domingo (1995)), the album and DVD featured four new songs: \\"Os Cegos do Castelo\\", \\"Nem 5 Minutos Guardados\\", \\"A Melhor Forma\\" and \\"N√£o Vou Lutar\\"; each is sung by each of the vocalists of the band's line-up at the time (respectively, Nando Reis, S√©rgio Britto, Branco Mello e Paulo Miklos). \\"A Melhor Forma\\" and \\"N√£o Vou Lutar\\" are actually old songs that did not get finished until the album. \\"Go Back\\" is featured in the album as a Spanish language version created by Martin Cardoso for Os Paralamas do Sucesso and to which Britto added some verses by Pablo Neruda in a spoken part. He did something similar on \\"Homem Primata\\", this time with some verses by Bob Marley. The version of \\"Pr√° Dizer Adeus\\" was chosen for radio airplay. In the first shows (including the ones recorded for the releases), \\"Bichos Escrotos\\" and \\"Pol√≠cia\\" consisted of short, virtually a cappella jingles by the band singing with the audience, but they eventually earned their own, full versions. In a 2014 interview, Reis explained that, unlike what many people believed, \\"Os Cegos do Castelo\\" makes no reference to Tit√£s, but to his relation with cocaine: \\"There are subliminal messages about this topic [Reis' relation to drugs] in many other songs of mine. \\"Cegos no castelo\\" is one of them. [...] It's much about my blindness, my isolation. The castle is a place where metaphorically I encastled myself.\\" One of the song's chord was inspired by \\"King Midas in Reverse\\", written by Graham Nash and released on the live album 4 Way Street by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, which Reis was listening to a lot back then.  Track listing   Reception  The album polarized critics inside Folha de S.Paulo. Luiz Ant√¥nio Ryff considered it \\"great\\" and that the CD version manages to \\"preserve the energy of the show and highlight the qualities of the band's performance. Maybe the most important of all is to prove that one does not need to equip a wall of amplifiers with guitars in order to make a vigorous show.\\" He also considered that some tracks earned versions better than the original and that \\"even when there is improvisations, the result is fine\\". However, a few months later, he would consider the acoustic shows of Os Paralamas do Sucesso better \\\\- the band would only release their Ac√∫stico MTV album in 1999. Marcos Augusto Gon√ßalves said the work \\"resurrected\\" the band which \\"dived into a crisis that could have ended it\\". \\"More mature, more relaxed with the individual liberty acquired in the last years and willing to escape from the alley in which they got into, the seven members of the group - who already tried a more eclectic work with \\"Domingo\\"- found in the 'unplugged' formula the way out of their difficult situation. On the other hand, Pedro Alexandre Sanches considered Ac√∫stico MTV a pure commercial play. He deemed it \\"illogic\\" to deprive \\"Pol√≠cia\\", \\"Cabe√ßa Dinossauro\\" and \\"Homem Primata\\" from their aggressiveness in favor of \\"the tackyness of the strings which ravages MPB\\" and to accept well versions of \\"Go Back\\" and \\"Comida\\" sung badly by \\"singers [...] with so little will to improve\\". He also criticized the version of \\"Go Back\\" for having transformed Torquato Neto's poem \\"into a badly pronounced and sung Spanish, using, once more, the bobo alegre Fito Paez as a pretext of transnational consecration\\". √Ålvaro Pereira J√∫nior panned the album and considered it to be \\"the worst of 1997\\". He said: \\"Pseudo-existential dilemmas, headiness, 'deep' arrangements. The worst faults that could affect a rock band appear in great doses. [...] Tit√£s are a fake band, the direct heirs of the affectation and conformism, fuel of this monster that dominates Brazilian music, the caetanic establishment. They shifted styles zillions of times (curiously, always embarking on what's being successful) and make a serious pose, in the best Herbert Vianna school of pretension\\". He had already expressed dislike for the album in a June 1997 text in which he accused the work of being \\"artificial\\" and compared them to pagode group Negritude J√∫nior, stating the latter had a more rock and roll attitude than the former. He also said: \\"Now, analyzing Tit√£s' trajectory (it sucks to talk about them again, but this \\"unplugged\\" album is of an abysmal badness, it's hard to escape), we see a band always trying to be what they're not. Raised on little contemplative caetanic music, they already tried new wave, grunge, head, punk and only now, finally, they clearly embraced the pretentious MPB that shaped them. In a pool involving 870 readers of Folha, however, the majority elected the album, the show and the band as the bests of the year. \\"Pr√° Dizer Adeus\\" was also chosen as the best song. In August 2018, Lucas Br√™da, at Vice magazine, elected Tit√£s' Ac√∫stico as the worst Ac√∫stico MTV in a list with 31 of the 33 albums released in Brasil under the project. = Commercial reception = The album sold 180,000 copies in less than one month, 500,000 until 18 August 1997 and three days later it was already their best-selling album, with 700,000 copies. In October 1997, the one million mark was reached.

Following the teachings of Anko Itosu and Anko Asato,Funakoshi, Gichin (1981). Karate-Do: My Way of Life, Kodansha International Ltd. . he was one of the Okinawan karate masters who introduced karate to the Japanese mainland in 1922. He taught karate at various Japanese universities and became honorary head of the Japan Karate Association upon its establishment in 1949. Early life Gichin Funakoshi was born on November 10, 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, in Shuri, Okinawa, to a Ry≈´ky≈´an Pechin. He originally had the family name Tominakoshi. Funakoshi was born prematurely. His father's name was Gisu. After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of Ank≈ç Asato, a karate and Jigen-ry≈´ master who would soon become his first karate teacher. ‚àí Funakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese topknot, and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination. Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank≈ç Asato. Shotokan Karate Funakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan karate of the time: Sh≈çrei-ry≈´ and Sh≈çrin- ry≈´. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, Sh≈çt≈ç (ÊùæÊø§), which means \\"waving pines\\". Kan means training hall or house, thus Sh≈çt≈çkan (ÊùæÊø§È§®) referred to the \\"house of Sh≈çt≈ç\\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid poet and philosopher who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would meditate and write his poetry.John Stevens (1995). \\"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\\". Kodansha International By the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922. In 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d≈ç. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai. The association is known today as Shotokai, and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage. In 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh≈çt≈çkan dojo (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the written characters of karate to mean \\"empty hand\\" (Á©∫Êâã) instead of \\"China hand\\" (ÂîêÊâã) (literally Tang dynasty) to downplay its connection to Chinese boxing. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing. Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \\"empty\\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object. Funakoshi's re-interpretation of the character kara in karate to mean \\"empty\\" (Á©∫) rather than \\"Chinese\\" (Âîê) caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in Tokyo indefinitely. In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the Japan Karate Association (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by Masatoshi Nakayama. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings. Illness and death Funakoshi developed osteoarthritis in 1948, and died on April 26, 1957. Legacy Funakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, Karate-Do: My Way of Life. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the niju kun, or \\"twenty principles\\". These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate. Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \\"become better human beings\\". Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \\"The Master Text\\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, kata, and kumite. The famous Shotokan Tiger by Hoan adorns the hardback cover. Memorial alt= A memorial to Gichin Funakoshi was erected by the Shotokai at Engaku-ji, a temple in Kamakura, on December 1, 1968. Designed by Kenji Ogata the monument features calligraphy by Funakoshi and S≈çgen Asahina (1891‚Äì1979), chief priest of the temple which reads Karate ni sente nashi (There is no first attack in karate), the second of Funakoshi's Twenty Precepts.

The station is 90.4 rail kilometers from Tokyo Station.  Station history Nebukawa Station first opened on December 21, 1922, when the section of the Atami-Odawara Line connecting Odawara with Manazuru was completed. During the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, at three minutes before noon on September 1, 1923, the local train of the Atami-Odawara Line was travelling south towards Manazuru and was stopped at Nebukawa Station. The earthquake caused a mudslide, which covered the station, sweeping the station building, platforms, and train into the ocean, 45 meters down the slope on which the station was built. The Type 960 locomotive and the first 7 cars in the train were submerged, with only the 8th car remaining above water. The train disaster killed 112 people, with an additional 200 people living in the close vicinity of the station also killed by the landslide. The wreck of the train and tracks were salvaged in September 1932 for scrap metal. The Tokyo- bound train on the same line was stopped in the middle of the bridge over the Nebukawa River just before the station, and was overwhelmed by a 35-foot tsunami, which swept the locomotive into the sea, killing six people.Hammer, p. 113-114. From December 1, 1934 the Odawara-Atami Line became part of the re-routed T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line following the opening of the Tanna Tunnel. Regularly scheduled freight services were discontinued in 1970, and small parcel services by 1972. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company.

ATV World, was one of two free- to-air English language television channels in Hong Kong, the other being its arch-rival TVB Pearl. Its sister station, ATV Home, broadcast in Cantonese language. It is owned and operated by Asia Television, and was broadcast from the ATV Enterprises Office at 25‚Äì37 Dai Shing Street in Tai Po Industrial Estate in Tai Po, which is in the Tai Po District, in the North East region of Hong Kong's New Territories. From Rediffusion to ATV ATV World's English channel, Rediffusion Television, began as a cable-operated and subscription- based pay television service on 29 May 1957 known on-air as Rediffusion Television English Network, and on 30 September 1963, the channel was renamed Rediffusion Television Cantonese Channel and Rediffusion Television English Channel. On 1 February 1967, the channels were renamed RTV-1 and RTV-2 respectively. On 1 December 1973, Rediffusion Television was granted a free- to-air terrestrial television broadcasting license for its two television channels, and closed its cable television channels. On 24 September 1982, Rediffusion Television was bought out by the new ATV, and consequently the Cantonese and English language channels were renamed ATV Cantonese and ATV English respectively. The channels were again renamed on 2 February 1987 as ATV Gold and ATV Diamond, and further renamed on 13 February 1989 as ATV Home and ATV World. ATV World was a 24-hour channel with multi-lingual programmes, transmitted in NICAM in analogue version, and multiple AC-3 streams in digital version. While most of programmes were broadcast in Hong Kong English, a few were in either Standard Chinese, Korean or Japanese without Hong Kong English. It was less popular than its English-language rival station rival TVB Pearl, though by a far smaller margin than ATV Home's loss to Hong Kong Cantonese rival TVB Jade. On 6 June 2012, ATV gained access to the London 2012 Olympic Games broadcast rights, and consequently the Games were shown on ATV World. Shows on ATV World ATV World was one of two English-language channels that broadcast in Hong Kong. It offered a variety of programmes, mostly from the United States, ranging from popular serial dramas and films to documentaries and educational shows. Among the shows it aired were: * Ally McBeal () * BoBoiBoy () * BoBoiBoy The Movie () * The Closer () * The District () * The Practice () * The Guardian () * The Agency () * Boomtown () * Traveler () * Cold Case () * CSI: Miami () * CSI: NY () * Jack & Bobby () * Justice () * 3 lbs () * Eleventh Hour () * Commander in Chief () * Jericho () * Damages () * Criminal Minds () * Private Practice () * E-Ring () * Doctor Who () * Torchwood () * Elizabeth I () * Ghost Whisperer () * Love Monkey () * Grey's Anatomy () * Smallville () * Survivor () * CSI: Crime Scene Investigation () * Hawaii Five-0 () * Eli Stone () * Psych () * 30 Rock () * SpongeBob SquarePants () * Camp Lazlo () * Psych 2 () * Greatest American Dog () * Matlock () =Now Playing= * NCIS: Los Angeles () * Seconds From Disaster () * CSI: NY () * V () * Merlin () * 60 Minutes () * Hunter Hunted () * The Dresden Files () * The Late News () ATV stopped carrying the talk show Late Show with David Letterman () as of 1 January 2009, but there was a grassroots movement to bring it back. Arts and sports programming were also offered (e.g. local horse racing, in Chinese ). Mandarin and Korean programmes were available on ATV World at off-peak hours. Warner Bros.

It also relayed the Xinwen Lianbo news programme from Chinese television channel, CCTV-1, which is the primary channel of the Chinese television network, China Central Television (CCTV), in the People's Republic of China which is also available throughout Hong Kong. Given its focus on Hong Kong English-language programming in a predominantly Hong Kong Cantonese-speaking market, ATV World carried relatively little advertising and was subsidised by ATV Home. Both of the-then free-to-air television companies in Hong Kong were required by the government to provide a Hong Kong English-language service. In the face of competition from TVB Pearl, ATV World had in recent years switched its focus from the provision of drama and movies to documentaries and natural history shows, probably because such programming is less expensive to acquire. Since the Hong Kong government does not have its own television station, its agency Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) required the-then two domestic free television stations to broadcast their programmes and advertisements. One of the well known programmes is Educational Television (ETV) which began in 1971. This followed the Hong Kong education syllabus, serving as a reference for primary and secondary school students of mathematics, Hong Kong English, Putonghua and other school subjects. During the thirty-two-week school year, ETV programmes were shown on ATV World from 10:00 to 12:00 and TVB Pearl from 14:00 to 16:00 each weekday. Non-English programmes Both ATV World and TVB Pearl were permitted by the Broadcasting Authority of Hong Kong to broadcast non-Hong Kong English programmes for up to 20% of their daily transmission time, outside peak viewing time. In fact, only 12% of TVB Pearl programmes are in languages other than Hong Kong English: 83.6% of those (10% of its total transmission time) are in Hong Kong Cantonese. The remainder include broadcasts in Japanese, Korean, Filipino and Hong Kong Cantonese. Obtaining schedules Schedules were published in the South China Morning Post, The Standard and in other daily Hong Kong newspapers, including Chinese newspapers. ATV Website ATV World operated its own official website which contained information about the programmes shown by the channel, and a streamed version of ATV News in English. ATV goes off the air On 1 April 2015, Hong Kong's Executive Council announced that ATV's broadcast license would not be renewed. ATV ceased over-the-air transmission on 1 April 2016. ATV plans to continue its business as a satellite and online broadcaster.

Nordic Classicism was a style of architecture that briefly blossomed in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) between 1910 and 1930. Until a resurgence of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism was regarded as a mere interlude between two much better-known architectural movements, National Romanticism, or Jugendstil (often seen as equivalent or parallel to Art Nouveau), and Functionalism (aka Modernism).  History  Copenhagen Police Headquarters (1924) by Hack Kampmann. The development of Nordic Classicism was no isolated phenomenon, but took off from classical traditions already existing in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. Nordic Classicism can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism, but also the early stirrings of Modernism from the Deutscher Werkbund ‚Äì especially their exhibition of 1914 ‚Äì and by the mid-1920s the Esprit Nouveau emerging from the theories of Le Corbusier. The modernist influence went beyond mere aesthetics: urbanisation tied to modern building techniques and the introduction of regulations both in building and town planning, and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the Nordic welfare state, and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the Beckomberga Hospital in western Stockholm (1927‚Äì1935) by Carl Westman) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925‚Äì27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic Classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the Puu-K√§pyl√§ Garden Town, Helsinki (1920‚Äì25) by Martti V√§likangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau riche). The year 1930 is usually considered the end point of Nordic Classicism because that was the year of the Stockholm Exhibition, designed mostly by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, when a more purist Modernism was unveiled as a model for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably √ñstberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931‚Äì34).  Notable architects  Parliament of Finland, Helsinki (1926-1931) by Johan Sigfrid Sir√©n Haugesund City Hall (1922-1931) by Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas Certain architects had reached the culmination of their careers already when the National Romantic style came, but their latter works were in the Nordic Classicism style (e.g. Carl Westman), the career of others culminated with Nordic Classicism (e.g. Ivar Tengbom and Ragnar √ñstberg), while others later went on to achieve far greater significance as Modernist architects (e.g. Arne Jacobsen, Alvar Aalto, and Sven Markelius). The two figures who achieved greatest significance in both periods, however, were Swedish architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.

Though these architects are listed by country, during this period there was an intense cultural exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical avant-gardism. Furthermore, with the exception of Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the First World War, allowing for continued cultural development.  Relationship to other movements  The Stockholm Maritime Museum (1931-1934) by Ragnar √ñstberg Skogskyrkog√•rden, cemetery (1917-1940) by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz Puu-K√§pyl√§ workers' housing area, Helsinki (1920-25) by Martti V√§likangas Interest in Nordic Classicism, especially in its most classical form, arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the height of postmodernism when critics, historians and architecture teachers were looking for historical precedents for the architecture of such architects as Michael Graves, Leon Krier and Robert Stern. Nordic classicism provided that precedent, especially with such seminal buildings as Gunnar Asplund's Scandia Cinema in Stockholm (1924), Listers District Courthouse (1917‚Äì21), Villa Snellman in Djursholm (1917‚Äì18) and Stockholm Public Library (1920‚Äì28), as well as the landscape and buildings of the Skogskyrkog√•rden Cemetery, Stockholm (1917‚Äì1940) by both Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz. In regards to architectural style, there were several precedents or reasons which account for the rise of Nordic Classicism. First was the existing classical tradition, borne from the architecture of Absolutism - that is, the classical architectural symbols of power of the Swedish and Danish monarchies - down to the vernacular, for instance in terms of considerations for symmetry, detailing and proportion. Throughout the 19th century there were a number of factors contributing to a more simplified classicism. The teachings of J.N.L. Durand at the √âcole Polytechnique of Paris at the beginning of the 19th century had attempted to rationalise the language and building techniques of classicism, while allowing for simple additive compositions. Durand's teachings spread, entering German culture in the form of Romantic Classicism with the work of Friedrich Gilly and Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of Pompeii, and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture ‚Äì an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the Renaissance, but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen, 1839‚Äì48, by M.G. Bindesb√∏ll, incorporates Egyptian motifs as does Asplund's Stockholm Public Library). There are also 'circles of reaction' to consider. Art Nouveau and National Romanticism had little impact in Denmark, while in Sweden, Norway and Finland there were also strong National Romantic reactions. Neoclassicism had arrived in Finland via Saint Petersburg as a universal language but by the end of the 19th century came to represent an alien presence ‚Äì that of Russia. Thus, when stirrings of political independence appeared in Finland and Norway, a rugged, national romantic architecture ‚Äì a local variation of Art Nouveau ‚Äì playing on the nationalistic myths, took hold. Nordic classicism was thus a counter- reaction to that style and eclecticism in general; a movement toward universalism, internationalism and simplification. Many of the architects who practiced in the Nordic Classical style made pilgrimages to northern Italy to study Italian vernacular architecture. With close cultural links at that time between the Nordic countries and Germany, another important source came from German critics of Art Nouveau, in particular Hermann Muthesius ‚Äì who had been a promoter of the English Arts and Crafts movement and founded the Deutscher Werkbund in 1907 ‚Äì and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, as well as the latter‚Äôs student Heinrich Tessenow, and Peter Behrens. In turn, the thinking in Nordic Classicism became one of the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that there would have been a continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with Le Corbusier and his 5 Points for Architecture, which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the Viipuri Library (1927‚Äì35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.

It was directed by Jacques Feyder and produced by Alexander Korda from a screenplay by Lajos B√≠r√≥ adapted by Frances Marion from the 1933 novel by James Hilton. The novel was published in the United States as Without Armour. The music score was by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, his first for a motion picture, using additional music by Tchaikovsky. Plot Englishman A. J. Fothergill (Robert Donat) is recruited by Colonel Forrester (Laurence Hanray) to spy on Russia for the British government because he can speak the language fluently. As \\"Peter Ouranoff\\", he infiltrates a revolutionary group led by Axelstein (Basil Gill). The radicals try to blow up General Gregor Vladinoff (Herbert Lomas), the father of Alexandra (Marlene Dietrich). When the attempt fails, the would- be assassin is shot, but manages to reach Peter's apartment, where he dies. For his inadvertent involvement, Peter is sent to Siberia. World War I makes Alexandra a widow and brings the Bolsheviks to power, freeing Peter and Axelstein. When the Russian Civil War breaks out, Alexandra is arrested for being an aristocrat, and Peter is assigned by now-Commissar Axelstein to take her to Petrograd to stand trial. However, Peter instead takes her to the safety of the White Army. Their relief is short-lived; the Red Army defeats the White the next day, and Alexandra is taken captive once more. Peter steals a commission as a commissar of prisons from a drunken official and uses the document to free her. The two, now deeply in love, flee into the forest on Alexandra's estate, where they enjoy a brief idyll. Later, they catch a train. At a railway station, they pretend to be brother and sister, but one Communist official has a photograph of the Countess. A young and sensitive Commissar Poushkoff (John Clements) entranced by Alexandra's beauty, brings in an old gardener from her father's estate who, tipped off by Poushkoff, swears that she is not the Countess. They must go to Samara for confirmation of her identity, and Poushkoff arranges to escort them. On the train, on the first night, his suspicions are confirmed when he sees Peter tenderly kiss her hand. Poushkoff's articulate speech, good manners and immaculate appearance suggest that he was a student. He advises them to come up with a better story. On the long journey, the trio become good friends, their poignant conversations about life and death operate on two levels. At one point, they tell him they ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù (that he is in love with Alexandra), and Alexandra says that meeting him was the greatest luck they have had. Deeply moved, he breaks down, weeping and kissing her hand, and they both console him. At a stop, he quietly and obliquely suggests a means of escape and steps away. Peter wonders, ‚ÄúWhat about the boy?‚Äù who might suffer if they do run. A shot rings out: Poushkoff has committed suicide to provide a diversion. The lovers board a barge travelling down the Volga River. Alexandra becomes seriously ill. When Peter goes for a doctor, he is arrested by the Whites for not having papers. Meanwhile, a doctor from an international Red Cross team finds Alexandra and takes her for treatment. About to be executed, Peter makes a break for it. At the station, a Red Cross doctor, a Scot who believes his story, dresses his wounded arm while a nurse reads aloud the passenger list of the train departing for Bucharest. When he hears Alexandra's name, Peter crashes through the door and runs for the moving train, calling her name. He clings to the outside of the cars. She hears him, tears the shade away from the window beside her bed, and reaches out to him crying ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù as the train speeds them to safety.

Dietrich persuaded him to wait until Donat recovered. In September 1936, two LNER Class J15 locomotives (numbers 7541 and 7835) were withdrawn by the LNER and sold to London Film Productions for use in this film. The locomotives were moved to Denham studios, where they underwent cosmetic modification to look more Russian. They were later sold to the War Department and worked on the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway as WD221 and WD212. During their war service, both were involved in incidents and returned to Stratford in 1944 and were subsequently scrapped. The sets were designed by Lazare Meerson the renowned Franco-Russian Reception New York Times critic Frank Nugent praised the film, approving the title change from the book (from Without Armour to Knight Without Armour), ‚Äúplacing it in the realm of chivalry and high adventure.‚Äù He described the production as ‚Äúa perfect fusion of several remarkable talents, so serene a blend that we cannot be sure which division is entitled to the most credit... It is a soundly narrated picture‚Äîcolorful, romantic, melodramatic, and a first rate entertainment.‚Äù Nugent singled out ‚Äúrelative newcomer‚Äù John Clements' ‚Äúmoving and poignant‚Äù portrayal of Poushkoff, predicting ‚Äúwe shall probably hear more of him.‚Äù In fact Clements had a brilliant career ahead of him, including a knighthood. In a 2016 article for Criterion, critic Michael Sragow notes that ‚ÄúBetween 1935 and 1940, when (Graham) Greene was the movie critic for The Spectator and the short-lived weekly Night and Day, no spy film won higher praise from him than.. Knight Without Armour...(Greene described the film as) ‚Äòmelodrama of the most engaging kind, the heroic wish-fulfillment dream of adolescence all the world over.‚Äô But he loved it all the same. Using one of the highest terms of praise in his critical lexicon, Greene called it ‚Äòa first-class thriller.' ‚Äú Greene's complete review appears at the end of the piece. The Variety review was somewhat unfavourable: \\"A labored effort to keep this picture neutral on the subject of the Russian Revolution finally completely overshadows the simple love story intertwining Marlene Dietrich and Robert Donat. ... Performances on the whole are good, though Dietrich restricts herself to just looking glamorous in any setting or costume.\\" Dietrich had been promised $250,000 plus 10% of the gross profits for her efforts. Korda's usual extravagance resulted in a budget of $350,000, much of it spent on authentic sets and costumes, and the film did not make a profit. Korda was unable to pay Dietrich fully, but she agreed to forego the rest if Korda hired Josef von Sternberg to direct I, Claudius.

It was scored by George Martin. The title song was written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Paul McCartney and Wings. It was the first Bond film score not to involve John Barry. History The music for most of the Bond films through Diamonds Are Forever had been scored by John Barry. Due to his working on a musical, and having fallen out with Bond producer Harry Saltzman over the last title song, Barry was unavailable to score Live and Let Die. pp. 103-104 Burlingam, Jon The Music of James Bond OUP USA, 11 Oct 2012 Producers Saltzman and Albert Broccoli approached Paul McCartney to write the theme song and McCartney in turn asked Martin to record it for him. Impressed with the orchestration for the finished track, Saltzman and Broccoli considered Martin for the film's score. Martin worked closely with director Guy Hamilton who described what the music should convey in each scene as it unfolds. Only very minor changes to the finished score were asked for. Martin felt that this was as much for Hamilton's accurate briefing. The orchestra was conducted by Martin and recorded at AIR Studios. The soundtrack was also released in quadrophonic. Title song Having recorded McCartney's performance, Martin was taken aback when Saltzman asked him who he thought should sing the film's title song, suggesting to him Thelma Houston. Saltzman had envisaged a female soul singer. Martin said that it should be McCartney. He nonetheless scored a soul arrangement to accompany singer B. J. Arnau for a nightclub sequence in the film. Live and Let Die was the first time that a rock music arrangement was used to open a Bond film. It was also the first time that McCartney and Martin had worked together since Abbey Road in 1969. McCartney had been considered as title song composer for the previous Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever. The song was nominated for an Academy Award but lost to \\"The Way We Were\\". The ‚Ä≥Live and Let Die\\" single was a major success in the U.S. and UK and continues to be a highlight of McCartney's live shows. Chrissie Hynde covered the song for Bond composer David Arnold's compilation album Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project. Track listing The original soundtrack LP ended with track 14, James Bond theme, and this version was released on CD in 1988. The digitally remastered CD re- release, 2003, as well as adding eight additional tracks, extended several of the original ones, such as Bond Meets Solitaire.

He is credited with introducing Meher Baba to the West. Life Starr was born in Prestbury House, Hampton, at Richmond in the County of Middlesex, England to well-to-do land owning parents (\\"landed proprietors\\") William Brooks Close and Mary Baker Brooks Close. When Starr was one year old his parents separated and he was raised by his mother. He received his education at Winchester College in Hampshire. Starr was a psychologist, homeopath, occultist and an editorial writer. He was also the principal player in bringing Meher Baba to the West for the first time at the start of the 1930s, although he himself did not remain a follower for very long. In the early 20th century, Starr wrote for The Occult Review, an illustrated monthly journal containing articles and correspondence by many notable occultists of the day, including Aleister Crowley, Arthur Edward Waite, W. L. Wilmshurst, Franz Hartmann, Florence Farr, and Herbert Stanley Redgrove. He probably changed his name to Meredith Starr when he was twenty in relation to his work as a reviewer and contributor for The Occult Review. He also wrote for Aleister Crowley's publication The Equinox, publishing Memory of Love (under the name \\"Herbert Close\\"), VII, 291 - Vol 7, in 1911. Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr established a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a couple of miles from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking in a sense of humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have played a central role in introducing Meher Baba to the western world.The Awakener Magazine Volume 11, 1966 In December 1932, Starr grew irritated with Meher Baba and wrote to him, \\"Give me either the 400 pounds you owe me or illumination; otherwise, I will leave you and expose you as a fraud!\\" He then did leave Meher Baba. The money he referred to was money he had spent hosting Meher Baba at his retreat in Devon. Starr disbanded the Devon retreat and sold the property a year and a half later.Kalchuri, Bhau: \\"Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba\\", Manifestation, Inc. 1986. p. 1747 He later organized 'nature cure and scientific relaxation' courses at Frogmore Hall, Herts.The Times, 24 August 1937; p. 1 He was married firstly on 1 March 1917 at Paddington Register Office to the Honourable Mary Grey, daughter of the 8th Earl of Stamford, by whom he had two sons.

The inequality is named after Lars G√•rding. Statement of the inequality Let Œ© be a bounded, open domain in n-dimensional Euclidean space and let Hk(Œ©) denote the Sobolev space of k-times weakly differentiable functions u : Œ© ‚Üí R with weak derivatives in L2. Assume that Œ© satisfies the k-extension property, i.e., that there exists a bounded linear operator E : Hk(Œ©) ‚Üí Hk(Rn) such that (Eu)Œ© = u for all u in Hk(Œ©). Let L be a linear partial differential operator of even order 2k, written in divergence form :(L u)(x) = \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq  \\\\alpha ,  \\\\beta  \\\\leq k} (-1)^{ \\\\alpha } \\\\mathrm{D}^{\\\\alpha} \\\\left( A_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (x) \\\\mathrm{D}^{\\\\beta} u(x) \\\\right), and suppose that L is uniformly elliptic, i.e., there exists a constant Œ∏ > 0 such that :\\\\sum_{ \\\\alpha ,  \\\\beta  = k} \\\\xi^{\\\\alpha} A_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (x) \\\\xi^{\\\\beta} > \\\\theta  \\\\xi ^{2 k} \\\\mbox{ for all } x \\\\in \\\\Omega, \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\}. Finally, suppose that the coefficients AŒ±Œ≤ are bounded, continuous functions on the closure of Œ© for Œ± = Œ≤ = k and that :A_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\in L^{\\\\infty} (\\\\Omega) \\\\mbox{ for all }  \\\\alpha ,  \\\\beta  \\\\leq k. Then G√•rding's inequality holds: there exist constants C > 0 and G ‚â• 0 :B[u, u] + G \\\\ u \\\\_{L^{2} (\\\\Omega)}^{2} \\\\geq C \\\\ u \\\\_{H^{k} (\\\\Omega)}^{2} \\\\mbox{ for all } u \\\\in H_{0}^{k} (\\\\Omega), where :B[v, u] = \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq  \\\\alpha ,  \\\\beta  \\\\leq k} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} A_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} (x) \\\\mathrm{D}^{\\\\alpha} u(x) \\\\mathrm{D}^{\\\\beta} v(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x is the bilinear form associated to the operator L. Application: the Laplace operator and the Poisson problem Be careful, in this application, Garding's Inequality seems useless here as the final result is a direct consequence of Poincar√©'s Inequality, or Friedrich Inequality. (See talk on the article). As a simple example, consider the Laplace operator Œî. More specifically, suppose that one wishes to solve, for f ‚àà L2(Œ©) the Poisson equation :\\\\begin{cases} - \\\\Delta u(x) = f(x), & x \\\\in \\\\Omega; \\\\\\\\\\\\ u(x) = 0, & x \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega; \\\\end{cases} where Œ© is a bounded Lipschitz domain in Rn. The corresponding weak form of the problem is to find u in the Sobolev space H01(Œ©) such that :B[u, v] = \\\\langle f, v \\\\rangle \\\\mbox{ for all } v \\\\in H_{0}^{1} (\\\\Omega), where :B[u, v] = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} abla u(x) \\\\cdot abla v(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x, :\\\\langle f, v \\\\rangle = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} f(x) v(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x. The Lax‚ÄìMilgram lemma ensures that if the bilinear form B is both continuous and elliptic with respect to the norm on H01(Œ©), then, for each f ‚àà L2(Œ©), a unique solution u must exist in H01(Œ©). The hypotheses of G√•rding's inequality are easy to verify for the Laplace operator Œî, so there exist constants C and G ‚â• 0 :B[u, u] \\\\geq C \\\\ u \\\\_{H^{1} (\\\\Omega)}^{2} - G \\\\ u \\\\_{L^{2} (\\\\Omega)}^{2} \\\\mbox{ for all } u \\\\in H_{0}^{1} (\\\\Omega). Applying the Poincar√© inequality allows the two terms on the right-hand side to be combined, yielding a new constant K > 0 with :B[u, u] \\\\geq K \\\\ u \\\\_{H^{1} (\\\\Omega)}^{2} \\\\mbox{ for all } u \\\\in H_{0}^{1} (\\\\Omega), which is precisely the statement that B is elliptic. The continuity of B is even easier to see: simply apply the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality and the fact that the Sobolev norm is controlled by the L2 norm of the gradient.

She then moved to Philadelphia to attend the University of Pennsylvania and was awarded her Ph.D. in immunology in 1976. For her doctoral thesis she demonstrated that single T-cell subsets could respond to both histocompatibility antigens and environmental antigens, establishing the unity of these two branches of the immune response. She was a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the Laboratory of Immunology, discovering the first functional evidence for the T cell‚Äìantigen-MHC-Ia tri-molecular complex anticipating the crystal structure. With the use of genetically inbred mice, Heber-Katz and collaborators dissected the fine molecular details that control the T-cell and macrophage interaction. This \\"A/5R experiment\\" confirmed the Determinant Selection Hypothesis concerning the spatial relationships between the histocompatibility I-A and I-E molecules on the surface of antigen- presenting cells, the bound antigen and the recognition structure of the T-cell receptor.

Bussard in the late 1970s. It is a tokamak on the basis of its magnetic geometry, but some unconventional engineering choices were made. In particular, Riggatron used copper magnets positioned inside the lithium blanket, which was hoped to lead to much lower construction costs. Originally referred to as the Demountable Tokamak Fusion Core (DTFC), the name was later changed to refer to the Riggs Bank, which funded development along with Bob Guccione, publisher of the adult magazine Penthouse. Conventional tokamak design In a conventional tokamak design the confinement magnets are arranged outside a \\"blanket\\" of liquid lithium. The lithium serves two purposes, one is to absorb the neutrons from the fusion reactions and produce tritium which is then used to fuel the reactor, and as a secondary role, as shielding to prevent those neutrons from reaching the magnets. Without the lithium blanket the neutrons degrade the magnets quite quickly. This arrangement has two disadvantages. One is that a magnetic field must be produced not only in the plasma, where it is needed, but also in the blanket, where it is not, significantly raising the construction costs. The other is that the core, where the magnetic coils penetrate the machine along its axis, must be large enough to contain the shielding, which limits the achievable aspect ratio. A higher aspect ratio generally results in better performance. Riggatron improvement The Riggatron re-arranged the layout of the conventional design, reducing the role of the lithium to producing tritium only. The magnets were to be directly exposed on the inside of the reactor core, bearing the full neutron flux. This precluded the use of superconducting magnets, and even copper magnets would have to be disposed in as little as 30 days of operation. The Riggatron was laid out to make this core replacement as easy and fast as possible. After removal and replacement, the magnets would then be melted down and reprocessed. Although this process would be costly, the smaller magnetized volume, the larger aspect ratio, and the reduction in complexity by avoiding superconducting magnets was a tradeoff that would, it was hoped, pay off. Another advantage of the parameters chosen was that ignition appeared to be possible with ohmic heating alone, as opposed to more expensive systems like ion injection normally required. The first proposal, made in the late 1970s, projected that the device would be able to produce about three or four times the power in fusion reactions as it used in powering the heaters and magnets. This represents a fusion energy gain factor (or simply \\"fusion gain\\" or Q) of three or four. The project was never completed as Guccioni was unable to secure the $150 million needed to build the full-sized device (much of which would have been for a large homopolar generator). Fusion research establishment consideration Studies carried out at the time suggest the Riggatron was not considered as much of a \\"sure thing\\" by other members of the fusion research establishment.Selection of a toroidal fusion reactor concept for a magnetic fusion production reactor Existing experimental tokamaks generally do not include a lithium blanket, and are thus fairly similar to the Riggatron in layout, yet none of these reactors is close to generating a fusion gain of one, let alone the three that was being claimed for the Riggatron. In retrospect it appears the Riggatron concept likely would not have worked, due to the various plasma instabilities that were only being discovered coincident with its design process. Interest in the Riggatron has essentially disappeared. With the demise of the original project, Bussard moved on to new inertial electrostatic confinement fusion designs with extremely high claimed performance. This culminated in his final development of IEC before his death in October 2007 - the Polywell device.

Thereafter he won several international organ competitions. In 1965 he won the improvisation competition in St Albans (UK). And, in three successive years, he won the competition in Haarlem (Netherlands), earning the \\"Challenge Award,\\" the only French interpreter to have achieved this distinction since the inception of the competition in 1951. Andr√© Isoir was organist titulaire at St-M√©dard in Paris from 1952 to 1967 and at St. Severin in 1967. Since 1973 he has been titulaire (head organist) at the ancient Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris. In 1974 Isoir was appointed to the organ staff at the Conservatoire d'Orsay, in 1977 promoted to the rank of National School of Music. He became a full professor in January 1978 and remained at Orsay until 1983, when he was appointed to the Conservatoire National de Region de Boulogne-Billancourt, where he taught organ until 1994.

The concept is common in countries with a parliamentary system in the Westminster model, or which are derived from or influenced by the Westminster model. The offence is known by various other names in jurisdictions in which the legislature is not called \\"Parliament\\", most notably contempt of Congress in the United States. Actions that may constitute contempt of Parliament include: * deliberately misleading a house of the legislature, or a legislative committee; * refusing to testify before, or to produce documents to, a house or committee; and * attempting to influence a member of the legislature by bribery or threats. In some jurisdictions, a house of the legislature may declare any act to constitute contempt, and this is not subject to judicial review. In others, contempt of Parliament is defined by statute; while the legislature makes the initial decision of whether to punish for contempt, the person or organisation in contempt may appeal to the courts. Some jurisdictions consider contempt of Parliament to be a criminal offence. Australia =Commonwealth level= In the Commonwealth of Australia, the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 defines contempt of Parliament as: Contempt decisions by the House of Representatives or the Senate are subject to review by federal courts. This follows after the Browne‚ÄìFitzpatrick privilege case, in which Morgan, Fitzpatrick and Frank Browne were denied legal representation, subsequently convicted, and served 90 days each in jail for publishing an allegedly defamatory article against a member of Parliament. Punishments are limited under the Act to (for individuals) a fine of $5,000 and/or six months' imprisonment, or (for corporations) a fine of $25,000. In the Senate, allegations of contempt are heard by the Privileges Committee, which decides whether or not contempt was committed, and if so, what punishment is to be imposed. In practice, there have been very few times when a hearing determined that anyone was in contempt, and on no occasions has anyone been punished beyond a warning, with an apology and/or other appropriate remedial action. =State level= Canada =Federal level= The power to find a person in contempt of Parliament stemmed from Section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867 in which \\"The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed ... shall not confer any privileges, immunities, or powers exceeding those at the passing of such Act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the members thereof.\\" Regarding the above-mentioned \\"privileges\\" there is an important difference between the \\"individual parliamentary privileges\\" and \\"collective parliamentary privileges\\". This difference is also important in any case of \\"breach of privilege\\" as it applies to parliamentary privilege in Canada. Contempt citation cases for individuals Rarely has the Canadian federal parliament invoked its power to find an individual in contempt: There were \\"contempt citation\\" cases in 1913, 1976, 2003, 2008 and 2011. The April 10, 2008 case involved Royal Canadian Mounted Police deputy commissioner Barbara George who was cited for contempt for deliberately misleading a parliamentary committee over an income trust scandal. She was ultimately found in contempt but was not punished further than the motion itself. The March 2011 contempt citation case involved Conservative MP Bev Oda. While she was found to be prima facie in contempt by the Speaker, Oda was not formally held in contempt because Parliament was dissolved before a vote could be held on the matter. Contempt citation cases for governments On March 9, 2011, Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada Peter Milliken made two contempt of Parliament rulings: The first found that a Conservative Party cabinet minister, Bev Oda, could possibly be in contempt of Parliament. The second ruling found the Cabinet could possibly be in contempt of Parliament for not meeting Opposition members' requests for details of proposed bills and their cost estimates, an issue which had \\"been dragging on since the fall of 2010\\". Milliken ruled that both matters must go to their responsible parliamentary committees and that the committee was required to report its findings to the Speaker by March 21, 2011 ‚Äì one day before the proposal of the budget. Concerning the Speaker's first ruling, on March 18, 2011, Opposition members of the committee (who outnumbered the government members) said they still judged Oda to be in contempt of Parliament, despite her testimony that day, but the committee process never proceeded far enough to make a finding as to whether Oda was in contempt. Concerning the Speaker's second ruling, on March 21, 2011, the committee tabled a report that found the Government of Canada in contempt of Parliament. As such, a motion of no confidence was introduced in the House. On March 25, 2011, Members of Parliament voted on this motion, declaring a lack of confidence by a vote of 156 to 145 and forcing an election. The contempt finding is unique in Canadian history. In a wider context, it is the first time that any government in the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations, either Commonwealth Realm or parliamentary republic, has been found in contempt of Parliament. Earlier that week, all three opposition parties had indicated that they would oppose the government's budget, with the NDP saying that the Conservatives' concessions did not go far enough, and the Bloc's earlier demands for $5 billion to their home province (including compensation for the 1998 ice storm and a new arena for the Quebec Nordiques) being rejected outright. Though the vote on the budget was never scheduled, a budget is a confidence matter in its own right, so Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament. During the campaign the Conservatives portrayed the \\"Liberal motion of non-confidence over the contempt-of- Parliament finding\\" as mischief, instead of focusing on the economy and making constructive proposals for the budget. The Conservatives framed the election as a choice between a stable Conservative majority government or a Liberal coalition backed by the NDP and/or Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. The resulting election devastated two of the opposition parties who supported the contempt motion, with the Liberals losing more than half their seats to drop to third place in the Commons for the first time, while the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois was nearly wiped out, with both their leaders also personally losing their ridings. The Conservatives gained enough seats to form a majority government, while the New Democratic Party won a record number of seats to form the Official Opposition. =Province level= At the provincial level, contempt operates in the legislative assemblies in much the same way that it does in the Senate or the House of Commons. While Section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867 only grants parliamentary privilege (and therefore contempt powers) to the Senate and the House of Commons, court cases have since clarified that the provinces do have parliamentary privileges. The Supreme Court of Canada, in New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), ruled that parliamentary privilege in both the provincial and the federal context is an unwritten convention of the Canadian constitution. More recent case law more clearly defined what parliamentary privileged means in the Canadian context, with the Supreme Court in Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid defining parliamentary privilege in part as \\"the sum of the privileges, immunities and powers enjoyed by the Senate, the House of Commons and provincial legislative assemblies.\\" With case law establishing that provincial legislatures maintain parliamentary privileges, the door is open for a provincial legislature to use contempt of parliament powers. Most provinces have codified parliamentary privilege, at least in part, such as in British Columbia's Legislative Assembly Privilege Act, or Manitoba's The Legislative Assembly Act, both of which touch on the powers of the legislatures to find people in contempt. Quebec, the only civil law province in Canada, has maintained its \\"tradition of codification\\" and has fully set out the privileges of their legislature, The National Assembly, in Division 1 of Chapter 3 of An Act Respecting the National Assembly, and maintains the \\"power to protect its proceedings against all interference.\\" Hong Kong Contempt of the Legislative Council is a criminal offence in Hong Kong. United Kingdom Contempt of Parliament consists of interference with parliamentary privilegeParliamentary privilege consists of freedom of speech on the floor of the House and in committee, freedom from arrest, regulating its membership and exclusive cognisance of internal affairs. Privilege extends to the publication of papers and reports by order of the House, including the official record Hansard. Freedom from arrest originally prevented the arrest (on criminal as well as civil grounds) of members, their goods and their staff. The freedom from arrest of servants and goods were removed in the 18th century as the privilege was open to abuse, as was immunity from arrest for criminal acts. MPs today are only protected from arrest on civil grounds, for contempt of court. Regulation of composition extends to determining who is elected and whether they may take their seat. The result of elections is now de facto a matter for an Election Court composed of High Court judges, who issue a certificate to the Speaker in the case of elections where the result is disputed. The House also has exclusive right to determine whether members may take up their seat, including whether a member is eligible to take the relevant oath. Exclusive cognisance of internal affairs extends to the right to determine the oaths to be taken by members and who may take them (Bradlaugh v Gossett), the right to determine who may use House of Commons facilities and the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the courts as to alcohol sale offences within the Palace of Westminster. and of certain acts that obstruct the house and its members in their business. The same rules as apply to the House of Commons apply to the House of Lords mutatis mutandis (i.e. with the necessary modifications). In the United Kingdom, it has been alleged that arresting a member of Parliament in the course of carrying out his duties may constitute contempt of Parliament, although immunity from criminal arrest was removed by the Parliamentary Privilege Acts of the 18th century. It is further contempt to bribe or attempt to bribe any member (and for any member to accept or solicit a bribe), to disrupt the sittings of the House or a committee‚Äîwherever it is sitting, to refuse to appear before a committee to testify, to refuse to answer any question put by a committee, to lie to a committee or to refuse to swear an oath (or make a solemn affirmation) when testifying, or to otherwise obstruct the business of the House. MPs accused of contempt of Parliament may be suspended or expelled. They may also be committed to the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster, although this practice has not been used since Charles Bradlaugh was detained in 1880. Strangers (those who are not members of the House) may be committed to prison during the life of the Parliament. The House of Lords has the power to fine as well as to order imprisonment for a term of years. On 4 December 2018, the UK Government was found in contempt of Parliament for the first time in history on a motion passed by MPs by 311 to 293 votes. The vote was triggered by the government failing to lay before Parliament any legal advice on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union, after a humble address for a return was unanimously agreed to by the House of Commons on 13 November. The government then agreed to publish the full legal advice for Brexit that was given to the Prime Minister by the Attorney General during negotiations with the European Union. However, this advice was never published in full.

The feature was produced by the Danziger Brothers, Edward J. Danziger and Harry Lee Danziger, from a screenplay by Vincent McConnor and Fletcher Markle, based on a story by John Roeburt.. Of note is that the film has cameo appearances by Marlene Dietrich, Henry Fonda, John Garfield, Burgess Meredith, Marsha Hunt, Doe Avedon, Everett Sloane, newspaper columnist Leonard Lyons, and the director Fletcher Markle. Plot The title refers to a jigsaw puzzle and the story begins with the murder of a print shop owner that is quickly labeled a suicide. But newspaper columnist Charlie Riggs is convinced that it was a murder related to a white neo-fascist organization called the Crusaders and imparts this suspicion to Assistant District Attorney Howard Malloy. He also publishes this opinion in his column. Then Riggs himself is murdered, inducing Malloy to launch an investigation into the Crusaders. Because the group appears to be getting backing from organized crime, Malloy looks there, soon receiving unsolicited help from a crime boss called Angel, who recommends him for the position of special prosecutor. Later, with further help from a prominent judge's widow, Malloy is appointed. This is supposed to put him in the pocket of those behind the murders. But Malloy proceeds to investigate the artist who created the Crusaders recruiting poster. Seeing in the artist's studio a painting of an attractive night club singer, Malloy then proceeds to investigate her. This leads to a series of revelations regarding all of these characters and ends with more people dead and wounded in a fiery exchange at the end.

It is sluggishly directed by Fletcher Markle, who also co-authored the script, and almost indifferently played, where good playing would do the most for it, by Franchot Tone in the principal role ... An irresistible temptation to get a few recognizable stars to play bit roles in the picture was accepted unfortunately. John Garfield is seen as a loafer, Henry Fonda as a waiter in a club, Burgess Meredith as a bartender, Marcia Hunt as a secretary and such. This tomfooling doesn't help the picture. It gives the whole thing a faintly prankish look.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, May 30, 1949. Accessed: July 12, 2013.

Falucharde of Caen in 2011. Faluchards socialising during an ap√©ritif in Caen. A faluche is a traditional cap worn by students in France. It is a black velvet beret, decorated with colored ribbons and badges. Several student groups wear the faluche, especially bitards, basochards, and faluchards. Previously, the faluche was associated almost exclusively with faluchards, although other folklore exists concerning the faluche.  History  Following demonstrations in 1884, the student association Association g√©n√©rale des √©tudiants of Paris (\\"A\\") was formed. On June 12, 1888, the Parisian students were invited to celebrate the 800th anniversary at the University of Bologna in Italy. At the celebration, the French students reportedly felt somewhat drab in comparison to the other students. The attire of the French delegation involved simply dark clothing brightened by one rosette in a buttonhole, and a ribbon in saltire with the colors of the town of Paris. Other European students, by contrast, had a wide variety of costumes and hairstyles: the Belgian students from secular schools had pennes, and those from Catholic schools had calottes; the Spaniards were bedecked with ribbons which proclaimed membership in specific universities; the Germans had their own caps; the Swiss had their thin kepis with small visors; the Italians wore a Louis XI-style hat, and others. The French students thus decided to create a specific style of cap for themselves. They chose the black velvet beret of the inhabitants of the Bologna area, in remembrance of the students' congress in Bologna, which they fondly remembered. On June 25, 1888, the date of the French students' return to Paris, that the faluche was really launched. Its popularity spread at the 600th anniversary of the University of Montpellier which took place May 22-25, 1890. From there, the tradition rapidly spread to other cities, with badges and ribbons added later. The symbols used, initially transmitted orally, varied by university. This is why a synthesis was made in Lille on March 8, 1986, inspired by the Toulouse code. It was adopted as a national code in December 1986 in Toulouse, and it was at this time that the concept of Grand Master began. Then in 1988, at the time of the centenary of Faluche in Reims, a new more complete code was published, taking into account the Montpellier characteristics. At the time of the German occupation during World War II, the wearing of the faluche was forbidden, except for the day of Saint Nicholas. In 1988 the 100th anniversary of the faluche was celebrated in Reims, which has continued annually, in a different city each year.  A \\"regulated\\" cap  The colors and badges related to the faluche recall the life of the student.

Except the students in sciences which have their satin ribbons. * In Bordeaux, the currency is on the circular, under the nickname. The badges on the circular are embroidered. * In Dijon, the ribbons are out of velvet because it is the city which organized the States G√©n√©raux in 1989 * In Grenoble, the initial ones are in embroidered letters, the leg of Grand Chambellan is cut at a peak, the pines chartreuse is located on the ribbon of town of study and there is no oath at the end of the baptism. * In Nantes the personal and codes parts are reversed. A red pompom is drawn up at the top pointing out the origins of Nantes, harbor city. By extension this symbol is tolerated for any origin of a harbor city. ** The students into dental raise a ribbon of purple velvet circular with a red velvet edging which recalls their first year of medicine. ** The students in economic sciences have like emblem the mercury caduceus and the balance (they were accommodated by the Droit corporation after the room of association had burned). * To Lyon, the military students of the health service of the armies, or standards, carry a third ribbon, blue-white-red, between the two other ribbons. In the middle of this tricolour ribbon the badge of the school of the health service of the armies of Lyon-Bron is. In pharmacy, always in Lyon, the single attribute of the Grand Ma√Ætre is a sun carried to the frontal, with the top of the circular green. * In Poitiers, all the ribbons are braided. Moreover, the color of the circular Sage-femme is red velvet, identical to the M√©decine circular but with the cross of Ankh. Moreover, the √©v√®que of the south is named there. * In Rouen, there is a third cross, that of the GD (Grand D√©lateur) which has as a role to prepare and to manage the \\"sanctions\\" during the baptisms. The former engineers have as a circular, a large black ribbon with a blue edging in the medium. The medical students (who place their caduceus on velvet and not on the crculaire) reverse the personal and official sides of their faluche. The students of law do not carry the colors of the town of Rouen but those of Jeanne d' Arc and their ribbons are not out of velvet but out of satin, (to be noted that this tradition is erased little by little). It is finally one of the only harbour cities not to raise the pompom. * In Toulon the faluche does not have a Grand Maitre nor of Grand Chambelan. It is assembled Resident of Toulon which decides on the jury and the officiants at the beginning of the baptism by vote. * In Tours the code is strictly followed. * In Valence the color of a circular BTS is red, white, red. Moreover, the GM and GC are called Bitards Valentinois (in honor of Bitards Poitevins because the first GM Valentinois were established by our neighbors of Poitou-Charentes and the Center). There is a \\"braid of sponsorship\\" (with the colors of the town of birth and province of birth), it is offered by the godson to the godfather when he considers his work accomplished.  Local codes  The Alsatian and Montpelli√©rains faluchards have a different code than that usually called national code; * The Alsatian faluche: in addition to differences in terms of colors of disciplines, badges and of provision of the ribbons, the Alsatian faluche is recognizable with the existence of velvet passers by on a flexible circumference (without reinforcement of leather or plastic), and of a mobile circular (which is not bent on the aforementioned circumference). The membership of the faluchard to the board of directors or the office of an association of students in a given field results in the presence of a \\"V\\" on the basis of the back of the faluche and pointing towards its center, with the colors of the field. In addition, there exists in its center neither Grand Ma√Ætre, neither Grand Chamberlans, nor Bishops. A collegial assembly old faluchards (the TVA for Tr√®s V√©n√©rables Anciens, co-opted among old the faluchards, which has more than two years of faluche), from a mixture of disciplines, have the role of being the guarantors of the local traditions faluchardes and of tallying the various ceremonies. They do not remain about it less faluchards like the others. Some faluchards (especially in medicine) carry the ribbon of the memory in memory of the left Alsatian students in Clermont-Ferrand during World War II. * In Montpellier, the faluche is characterized by the presence from four burst with the colors from the studied principal discipline, thus forming four parts of black velvet equal. This tradition pays homage to Rabelais, who studied with the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier to the 16th century. Organization The faluchards in the majority of the courses of study and for each city elect a Grand Ma√Ætre (GM) appointed like guarantor of the traditions and supported by a Grand Chamberlan (GC) whom it chooses. Their badge is a registered cross of the expression to the merit, which they carry at the end of a ribbon of the color of their course. The cross of GM is enamelled of white and that of GC is gilded. In Valence and Grenoble, the GC has a ribbon points some without cross with the colors of their discipline. There are also three bishops who \\"reign\\" in a part of France: They \\"reign\\" in the towns of Amiens, Dijon and Poitiers. The bishop is recognized for his empathy and is charged to regulate the conflicts like celebrating the marriages faluchards. In Nice there are also 12 knights who carry a kilt, representing the various courses of study of faluch√©s ni√ßois, charged with organizing the faluchages and to be the guards of the traditions. The GM and GC are selected among the knights. There is even a specific code for the knighthood falucharde ni√ßoise. There are also orders (which do not have anything official) within the faluche. The membership of a brotherhood can be displayed on the faluche by a ribbon or a badge particular to each brotherhood.

It was produced by Savita Raj Hiremath under the Taandav Films label and Ronnie Screwvala from UTV Motion Pictures. Written by Jaideep Sahni, the film stars Anupam Kher, Boman Irani, Parvin Dabas, Vinay Pathak, Ranvir Shorey and Tara Sharma in the lead roles. The story follows Kamal Kishore Khosla (Kher), a middle-class Delhiite and his family's attempt to reclaim their land which has been seized by a builder named Khurana (Irani). Banerjee, an advertising filmmaker, wanted to make a feature film which showcased Delhi the way it is. The initial idea conceived by Hiremath and Sahni was about a generation gap. After finishing the script, Sahni informed Banerjee that he had found a producer in Delhi and asked him if he wanted to direct the film; Banerjee agreed to do so. The film had no buyers for two years during which time editing continued. The team showed the film to several people who loved it but were unwilling to back it. In 2006, UTV Motion Pictures stepped in and distributed the film. Khosla Ka Ghosla was screened at the 2006 Kara Film Festival and was released on 22 September 2006 to positive critical reception. It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi at the 54th National Film Awards. Made on a production budget of ‚Çπ37.5 million, the film earned a total of ‚Çπ66.7 million at the box-office, making it a commercial success. It was later remade in 2008 in Tamil as Poi Solla Porom, and in Kannada as Rame Gowda Vs. Krishna Reddy in 2010.  Plot  Kamal Kishore Khosla is a middle-class man living in New Delhi where he has purchased a plot of land to build a house. His family includes his wife Sudha, the younger son, Chirauonji Lal a.k.a. Cherry, elder son Balwant a.k.a. Bunty and his daughter Nikki. Kamal has invested all his savings into buying the plot. Cherry is not too interested in his father's plan to settle together in the new house. He is a software engineer and intends to move to the US to take up a job there. However, Cherry has not let his family in on his plans. The only person he discusses this with is Asif Iqbal, the agent helping him with his passport and visa paperwork. Much later, he shares this news with his girlfriend Meghna. Later Cherry reveals to his family about his new job in America. During a visit to their land for Bhumipujan, they find their plot encroached upon by someone. Further probing reveals the squatters are part of a property usurping nexus headed by the corrupt and powerful Kishan Khurana. Upon being urged so by the property dealer who had facilitated the purchase of the plot, Kamal and Bunty visit Khurana who demands ‚Çπ1.5 million to vacate the plot, an amount which Kamal neither has nor agrees to pay. He appeals to authorities and agencies for help. None of them offers more than to get the amount Khurana demands reduced by a few lacs in exchange for a hefty commission for mediating. Spurred by his father's helplessness, Bunty gets help from a gang of local wrestlers who demolish the boundary walls built by Khurana's men and take back possession of the plot by force. This success is short-lived when Kamal is arrested on trumped-up charges of trespass. Released at Khurana's guileful behest after spending a day in jail, Kamal's will is broken and his pride battered. He tells his family to avoid taking any further action as he is incapable of fighting back and wants Cherry to concentrate on the job that he is arranging abroad. Cherry discusses the grim situation with Iqbal who is revealed to have been an old partner of Khurana's and who has been cheated by him, having usurped Asif's own ancestral land. Asif offers to help the Khoslas with a group of Meghna's friends, and they set up a plan to deceive Khurana. They portray some land (owned by the fisheries department, but which has been vacant for decades) as their own, and seek the help of Meghna's mentor, Bapu, to act as the owner of the land looking for a buyer. Bapu, who is the manager of a drama theatre group, acts as the owner of the vacant land. With the help of the rest of his theatre group, they manage to create a situation so that Khurana believes the authenticity of the land and its owner. The deal is almost finalised and Khurana asks to visit the land. They successfully dupe Khurana and take his cash. From that money, Kamal pays the ransom to Khurana and regains possession of his plot; the remaining cash is divided equally between the Khoslas, Asif and the theatre group. Cherry scraps his plans to migrate to the US, marries Meghna and settles with his family in their new house built on the plot.

The initial idea of the generation gap was conceived by Savita Raj Hiremath and his writer friend Jaideep Sahni, who had worked with Banerjee on advertising films. Sahni said the soul of Khosla Ka Ghosla was derived from their experience of growing up in a middle-class house in Delhi. The first half of the film was based on Sahni's personal experience of an incident in his family which left an impression on him. He thought about \\"how our entire system can so callously and efficiently come together in no time to exploit a common man in trouble.\\" Later Sahni informed Banerjee that he had found a producer from Delhi and asked him if he wanted to direct the film; Banerjee agreed to do so. Banerjee said a real life experience when Sahni witnessed his father being insulted by someone powerful, helped them to develop the character of the antagonist Khurana. Sahni worked on the story for a year-and-a-half and finished in 2003. Both Banerjee and Sahni first approached Anupam Kher to play Kamal Kishore Khosla; he was \\"hooked\\" after their discussions. Vinay Pathak had auditioned for Khurana's character for which Boman Irani was eventually selected, but the team liked Pathak's audition and offered him the role of Asif Iqbal. Ranvir Shorey was selected for the role of Balwant after two or three rounds of auditions. The role of Khurana was also offered to Rishi Kapoor who refused it. Hiremath felt this was because \\"commercially, it (the role) wasn't working for him.\\" Irani had also initially refused the offer to play Khurana as he felt he was unsuitable for the role of a builder from Delhi since he was a Mumbai-born Parsi. He accepted the role after \\"a lot of people had raised their eyebrows\\" at his decision and he felt determined to make it work. Irani drove around and listened to interviews recorded with actual property dealers. He also watched real footage captured using hidden cameras to understand how they behaved. Kher said that he tried to boost the team's morale as the film was made while enduring a lot of stress. Tara Sharma was selected for the role of Meghna after an audition. Banerjee was initially reluctant to give Parvin Dabas the role of Chiraunjilal as he thought the latter would not be able to do justice to the \\"layered character.\\" Dabas but later cast in the role after a recommendation and an audition. Navin Nischol was cast as Bapu. During the course of filming, Banerjee kept Irani separate from the rest of the cast as he did not want them to meet. During filming, the investors demanded the addition of action sequences, an item song and changes in the cast. The team did not fancy these changes so Padmalaya Telefilms, their first investor, backed out of the project. Hiremath said that she had to \\"shell out cash\\" from her other company. The film's small budget meant there were limited reels to shoot. After the filming finished, the team had no money for post-production. The entire film was shot in 45 days in Delhi during the summer. The entire opening dream sequence was filmed in one take using a hand-held camera to give it a \\"separate look from the rest of the film\\". Amitabha Singh served as the director of photography, while Sejal Painter was the editor. Banerjee had a different, sad ending for the film, but opted for Sahni's version of a more optimistic ending after realising his idea would make the film darker. The film did not have any buyers for two years. During this period editing continued. The team showed the film to several people who loved it but were unwilling to back it. Banerjee said that he gave up on releasing the film after several rejections. Later, in 2006, UTV Motion Pictures stepped in and distributed the film.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack album of Khosla Ka Ghosla was composed by Dhruv Dhalla and Bapi‚ÄìTutul while the lyrics were written by Jaideep Sahni. It consists of five songs with vocals by Kailash Kher, Kunal Ganjawala, Sowmya Raoh, Adnan Sami and Qadar Niazi Qawwal. Savita, the film's producer, managed to raise some funds for the music and Sahni wrote the lyrics the same day as he was worried they might miss the opportunity. This was Dhalla's debut film. Banerjee called him after hearing his music samples and asked him to create \\"a Punjabi number based on the loud attitude of Delhi.\\" Dhalla composed the tune for \\"Chak De Phattey\\" in three hours. The album received moderate reviews. Joginder Tuteja of IndiaFM called it an \\"average soundtrack with two songs standing out.\\" Further writing: \\"While 'Chak De Phattey' is a potential chartbuster, 'Intezar Aitbaar Tumse Pyaar' makes for an easy-on-ears listening.\\"  Release and response  Khosla Ka Ghosla was screened at the 2006 Kara Film Festival and the Hay Festival in 2012. It was released theatrically on 22 September 2006 on 125 screens throughout the country. The film was released on the DVD format on 6 November 2006 and is also available on the online streaming platform, Netflix. = Critical reception = Khosla Ka Ghosla opened to wide critical acclaim upon its release. Rajeev Masand lauded the film for its \\"refreshingly original plot, bang-on casting, killer soundtrack and such crisp editing that there is never a dull moment\\". A review in The Times of India called it \\"a small, unpretentious venture with some real funny performances\\". Raja Sen described the film as the \\"best comedy Bollywood has seen in the last two decades\\", adding: \\"The everyday detailing is exquisite, as is the ensemble cast dealing with a frighteningly realistic first half escaping into a breezily unreal second half. It‚Äôs sheer magic.\\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today declared the film as \\"a class apart.\\": \\"It brings back an innocence to movies missing in the sturm und drang of big budgets and bigger stars.\\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com felt the film was charming for its \\"striking believability and everyday simplicity.\\" However, she noted that it \\"felt longer than it was.\\" Namrata Joshi described the film as \\"utterly discreet and unassuming\\", one that \\"tries to bring back the clean and simple story-telling of Sai Paranjpye and Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\\" Taran Adarsh noted that the film \\"loses sparkle in the second hour\\". He also concluded that on the whole \\"Khosla Ka Ghosla is a well scripted and executed film that is sure to stand out in the crowd.\\" Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu included the film on his list of top 10 movies of the decade 2000‚Äì2009 saying: \\"Dibakar Banerjee and Sahni on a shoestring budget chose to bat for the common man‚Äôs struggle against the powerful and reunited the individual self back with the family.\\" David Parkinson of Radio Times wrote: \\"Switching between bright comedy and social drama, this is Bollywood entertainment with a conscience.\\" In September 2018, Bhaskar Chawla of Arre noted that the film had \\"set the template for what was to become a new direction in Hindi cinema\\" that went \\"beyond the conventional formula of Bollywood.\\" = Box office = Khosla K Ghosla was made on a production budget of approximately . It earned on its opening day and a total of at the end of the opening weekend. At the end of its first week, the collection was . The film earned a total of at the box office after the end of its theatrical run. The gross figure is including worldwide collection of . = Awards = Khosla Ka Ghosla won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi at the 54th National Film Awards. In October 2015, Banerjee decided to return the award to the government along with 12 other filmmakers, to protest the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's refusal to roll back Film and Television Institute of India's appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as its chairman. The film's producer, Savita Raj Hiremath, claimed that Banerjee had no right to return the award since it was given to the film and not him.  Post release  Khosla Ka Ghosla is considered by many critics as one of the best films by Banerjee. It was included in Filmfares 100 Days series‚Äî\\"With no big stars, relatively unheard of a director and a subject that you wouldn't rate on paper as the most exciting, Khosla Ka Ghosla manages to impress one and all.\\" It was also mentioned in critic and author Shubhra Gupta's book, 50 Films That Changed Bollywood, 1995‚Äì2015. In 2013, The Delhi Police Crime Branch caught a gang of cheats who duped several people by selling them plots belonging to the Delhi Development Authority by using forged documents. The officials said that the method adopted by the gang appeared to have been inspired by the film. The film was remade in Tamil as Poi Solla Porom. Directed by A. L. Vijay, the film starred Karthik Kumar, Piaa Bajpai, and Nedumudi Venu in the lead roles. It was released on 12 September 2008. It was unofficially remade in Kannada by T. N. Nagesh as Rame Gowda Vs. Krishna Reddy in 2010.

The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion. RealTechNews reported that the forum at the United Kingdom-based National Society for Epilepsy was also subjected to an identical attack. It stated that \\"apparent members of Anonymous\\" had denied responsibility for both attacks and posted that it had been the Church of Scientology who carried them out. News.com.au reported that the administrators of 7chan.org had posted an open letter claiming that the attacks had been carried out by the Church of Scientology \\"to ruin the public opinion of Anonymous, to lessen the effect of the lawful protests against their virulent organization\\" under the Church's fair game policy. The church has previously been involved in false flag operations to frame and discredit groups or peoples it disagrees with such as Operation Freakout and Gabe Cazares. The Tech Herald reported that when the attack began, posts referenced multiple groups, including Anonymous. The report attributes the attack to a group named \\"The Internet Hate Machine\\" (a reference to the KTTV Fox 11 news report), who claim to be part of Anonymous, but are not the same faction that are involved in the campaign against Scientology. Some Anonymous participants of Project Chanology suggest that the perpetrators are Internet users who merely remained anonymous in the literal sense, and thus had no affiliation with the larger anti-Scientology efforts attributed to Anonymous. During an interview with CNN, Scientologist Tommy Davis accused Anonymous of hacking into the Epilepsy Foundation website to make it display imagery intended to cause epileptic seizures. Interviewer John Roberts contended the FBI said that it \\"found nothing to connect this group Anonymous (with these actions),\\" and that it also has \\"no reason to believe that these charges will be leveled against this group.\\" The response was that the matter was on the hands of local law enforcement and that there were ongoing investigations. Controversy According to the Wall Street Journal, the foundation, with its local affiliates, has been lobbying for state laws in 25 states that would prevent pharmacists from substituting generic epilepsy drugs for brand-name drugs unless the pharmacist had written consent of the physician or patient. The pharmaceutical industry has also been lobbying state legislatures for the change, and working with the foundation. The pharmaceutical industry spent $8.8 million in state campaign contributions in 2006. In its annual report, the Epilepsy Foundation reported that it got $500,000 to $999,999 from GlaxoSmithKline, and $100,000 to $499,999 from each of Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson. Representatives of four pharmaceutical companies sit on the Epilepsy Foundation's board, as does Billy Tauzin, head of PhRMA, which gave $25,000 to $49,999. The Foundation denied that pharmaceutical funding had anything to do with its support of the laws. Generic drug substitution is significant, because four major branded drugs, with $5 billion revenue last year, went off-patent by 2010. (The five best- selling drugs are Topamax, Lamictal, Lyrica, Keppra and Depakote.) Pharmacists can substitute generics, because every generic drug, in order to be approved, has to demonstrate that it is equivalent to the branded drug. The Epilepsy Foundation received anecdotal reports of patients experiencing seizures and side effects after switching drugs, and tried to convince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 that there was a problem, but the FDA decided there was no evidence. In 2006, the Foundation convened a committee of medical experts, and its own experts also found no evidence. Nonetheless, the Foundation recommended that doctors be required to give permission to switch their patients' prescriptions to generic drugs.Pill push: Industry fights switch to generics for epilepsy, big drug makers help patient groups lobby; more attention to states, Sarah Rubenstein, Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2007.

The upper basalt is Roza Member, while the lower canyon exposes Frenchmen Springs Member basalt. Moses Coulee is a canyon in the Waterville plateau region of Douglas County, Washington. Moses Coulee is the second-largest and westernmost canyon of the Channeled Scablands, located about to the west of the larger Grand Coulee. This water channel is now dry, but during glacial periods, large outburst floods with discharges greater than carved the channel. While it's clear that megafloods from Glacial Lake Missoula passed through and contributed to the erosion of Moses Coulee, the origins of the coulee are less clear. Some researchers propose that floods from glacial Lake Missoula formed Moses Coulee, while others suggest that subglacial floods from the Okanogan Lobe incised the canyon. The mouth of Moses Coulee discharges into the Columbia River. Two National Natural Landmarks were established in 1986 for features, notable as the best examples of their kind, in and around Moses Coulee. The Great Gravel Bar of Moses Coulee, on the western edge of Moses Coulee where US Highway 2 crosses the coulee, is described as \\"the largest and best example of a pendant river bar formed by catastrophic glacial outburst floods that swept across the Columbia Plateau prior to the last Pleistocene glaciation.\\" Withrow Moraine and Jameson Lake Drumlin Field \\"contains the best examples of drumlins and the most illustrative segment of the only Pleistocene terminal moraine in the Columbia Plateau biophysiographic province. ... They are also the only such glacial features in the world to show a clear geological relationship to catastrophic flooding.\\" The canyon is named for Chief Moses (1829‚Äì99). Geologic history Moses Coulee at mid canyon =Geological setting= Moses Coulee cuts into the Waterville Plateau, which lies in the northwest corner of the Columbia River Plateau. The plateau is part of the Columbia River Basalt Group, a large igneous province that lies across parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the United States of America. During late Miocene and early Pliocene times, one of the larger flood basalts ever to appear on the earth's surface engulfed about 163,700 km¬≤ (63,000 mile¬≤) of the Pacific Northwest, forming a large igneous province with an estimated volume of 174,300 km¬≥. Eruptions were most vigorous from 17--14 million years ago, when over 99% of the basalt was released. Less extensive eruptions continued from 14--6 million years ago. These lava flows have been extensively exposed by the erosion resulting from the Missoula Floods, which laid bare many layers of the basalt flows on the edges of the plateau along the course of Moses Coulee.Portions of this article, including a figure, are adapted from works of the United States Government, which are in the public domain =The glacial history= Illustration of the glacial impacts showing the events leading to formation of Moses Coulee. Pleistocene glaciers advanced onto the Waterville Plateau, with the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet reaching as far south as the town of Withrow. Evidence for glaciation on the Waterville Plateau includes polished and striated bedrock, glacial erratics, drumlinoid topography, eskers, moraines, meltwater channels, and glacial till. The Withrow Moraine complex marks the maximum southern extent of the Okanogan Lobe, and a series of recessional moraine complexes represent retreating ice margins. Ice damming of the Columbia River formed Glacial Lake Columbia and Lake Spokane, larger lakes than Lake Roosevelt, which is currently backed up in the same location behind the Grand Coulee Dam.USGS Site =Creation of Moses Coulee= Lower Moses Coulee looking up canyon on the Waterville Plateau. Drainages of the plateau which existed prior to the glacial floods cut the truncated streambeds on the sides of the coulee. A precursor to glacial-flood-cut Moses Coulee existed prior to the glacial floods as a drainage basin with a number of side streams, draining the southern portion of the plateau. These streams had combined into a canyon that drained to the Columbia near the current mouth of Moses Coulee. These side drainages are still visible today along the coulee walls as truncated streambeds, interspersed with gable-like highlands.Washington history link. The Okanogan lobe of the Cordilleran Glacier moved down the Okanogan River valley, covering 500 mi¬≤ of the Waterville Plateau and blocked the ancient route of the Columbia River, backing up water to create Glacial Lake Columbia and Lake Spokane. Initially water discharged from Lake Columbia by running up through the head of Grand Coulee and down through Foster Coulee to rejoin the Columbia River. As the glacier moved further south, Foster Coulee was cut off and the Columbia River then discharged through Moses Coulee, which runs southward slightly to the east of the ancient and current course of the Columbia. As the Okanogan lobe grew, it blocked Moses Coulee as well; the Columbia found the next lowest route through the region which was eroded to become the modern Grand Coulee. Flowing across the current Grand Coulee and Dry Falls regions, the ice age Columbia then entered the Quincy Basin and joined Crab Creek, following Crab Creek‚Äôs course southward past the Frenchman Hills and turning west to run along the north face of the Saddle Mountains and rejoin the previous and modern course of the Columbia River just above the main water gap in the Saddle Mountains, Sentinel Gap. Although the Columbia River flowed only for a short period through Moses Coulee, this period included one or more of the tremendous flows from the Missoula Floods. =After the glacier= As the Okanogan lobe melted, the upper portions of Moses Coulee were littered with clear evidence of its passing in the Withrow Moraine. The glacier left behind a blanket of glacial till, up to thick in places. This glacial till, made up of clay, silt, sand, gravel, cobblestones, and erratic boulders, covers most of the upper coulee. Today Moses Coulee supports an excellent example of a shrub-steppe ecoregion. Vegetation includes sagebrush, rabbitbrush, greasewood, hopsage, bitterbrush, bunchgrass, buckwheat and other vegetation once common to most of the Columbia Plateau. Moses Coulee Preserve The Nature Conservancy has established the Moses Coulee Preserve, which is a contiguous, intact shrub-steppe habitat. It is located south of Jameson Lake near the head of Moses Coulee. It provide habitat for a rich variety of birds (lazuli bunting, common goldeneye, sage thrasher, sage sparrow, poorwill, mountain bluebird, loggerhead shrike, canyon wren, white-throated swift, golden eagle), plants (sagebrush buttercup, shooting star, sulphur lupine, serviceberry, mock orange, slender cryptantha, Tiehm's rush, big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and sego lily) and animals (mule deer, least chipmunk, bats, and marmot).Nature Conservancy site References External links *University of Wisconsin Green Bay geological site addressing Moses Coulee *Moses Coulee & Beezley Hills: A Signature Western Landscape Category:Protected areas of Douglas County, Washington Category:Geology of Washington (state) Category:Glaciology of the United States Category:Geography of Washington (state) Category:Columnar basalts Category:National Natural Landmarks in Washington (state) Category:Landforms of Douglas County, Washington Category:Canyons and gorges of Washington (state) ","title":"Moses Coulee"},{"id":"7999886","text":"is an autobahn located between Hamburg and Buchholz in der Nordheide.

It is the first album composed entirely of new material since 1995's Domingo; the first (and only) released via Abril Music following the end of the partnership they had with WEA since the band's debut; the first without founding member and guitarist Marcelo Fromer, who died just before the recording sessions (and to whom the album is dedicated); the last featuring founding member, vocalist and bassist Nando Reis, who would leave the band after the album's release to focus on his solo career, and the last produced by Jack Endino. Fromer's death almost prompted the remaining members to postpone the album's recording and even made them consider ending the band, but the then sextet decided to carry on, deducing it would be what the guitarist wanted if alive. While the album's title criticizes \\"superficial\\" lists compiled by the press, the album's lyrics deal with various themes ‚Äì including death, despite the songwriting taking place before the musician's passing. The album was written under pressure from fans and critics, who saw the band release three albums mostly consisting of covers or re-recordings (Ac√∫stico MTV, Volume Dois and As Dez Mais). A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana received mostly positive reviews, but did not sell as well as its three predecessors.  Background  This is the first album since Domingo (1995) to contain only new songs. Previously, the band had released Ac√∫stico MTV, with acoustic versions of some of their songs and four new ones; Volume Dois, a studio effort that continued the acoustic concept and brought more new tracks; and As Dez Mais, a tribute album. While Reis commented he did not notice such interval, vocalist Branco Mello and vocalist/keyboardist S√©rgio Britto considered it was a period of great experience. Tit√£s were experiencing pressure from critics due to the long period with little new material, specially after three members (Britto, Reis and vocalist Paulo Miklos) released solo albums in the period (respectively: A Minha Cara, Para Quando o Arco-√çris Encontrar o Pote de Ouro and Vou Ser Feliz e J√° Volto). Due to that, some members considered the album as the only choice they had and also as a re-debut. According to Alexandre Negado, from Omelete, the band announced a DJ would perform on the album, beginning an electronic incursion for the band, but the idea was ultimately abandoned. On 11 June, a couple of days before they started the recording sessions, guitarist Marcelo Fromer was rammed by a motorcyclist in S√£o Paulo and taken to the hospital with severe injuries. He died two days later. Instead of interrupting the activities, the members decided to carry on with it and record the album within the deadline they set. Drummer Charles Gavin said at the time that \\"stopping would have been much worse for us, we would be depressed, isolated\\". In 2013, when singer Chor√£o from Charlie Brown Jr. died, Mello said the band decided to carry on to keep Fromer's dream (and theirs) of having a rock band alive. When commenting on the impact of his death during the recording sessions, American producer Jack Endino said: It was only during the recording sessions that the band truly absorbed the member's death. According to Miklos, \\"we were so focused on recording and resuming the project that we did not think before. Now that we reunited for some sessions, we are realizing it\\", he said by the time of the album's release. He would recall that time in a 2013 interview:  Production and recording  The album was pre-produced at Est√∫dio Vinil Junkie, in S√£o Paulo, in Abril and May 2001. Endino took part of the album as a instrumentalist, playing Fromer's guitar parts (musician Emerson Villani, who was also a Tit√£s session member, also recorded some parts), and also handling the bass in some tracks under Reis' request, so that he could focus on the acoustic guitar. The band though of using some recordings of Fromer for the album, but they lacked the necessary quality. Endino also had to face another death during the sessions: his father's, at age 84. The passing forced him to go back to Seattle, United States, for a week, a period in which he was replaced by Paul Ralphes, who produced Britto's debut solo album. Mixing took place in X Studio in Seattle, between 16 August and 2 September 2001, by Endino and Tit√£s. Mastering happened in 4 September 2001 at Sterling Sound, in New York City, United States. For this stage, Gavin travelled to the American city ‚Äì while he was there, the September 11 attacks occurred. The album was then finished in Seattle by Endino and some members of the band.  Concept, composition and lyrics  The album title, as well as the title-track, are a play with \\"best\\" lists that the press \\"shove down the public's throat\\", despite the band admitting to be part of that. It also criticizes the superficiality shown by music at the time, music made to be \\"consumed\\"; but the criticism was expressed in a \\"ironic\\" and \\"sarcastic\\" way. 40 songs were composed for the album and 16 made it to the final tracklist. Fromer co-wrote five of them. There are tracks written by multiple members and tracks written by only one. Despite some of the lyrics dealing with death (\\"Epit√°fio\\" and \\"Um Morto de F√©rias\\", for example), they were all composed before the accident. Tony Bellotto says the tracks reflected the moment lived by Fromer at the time, \\"going through a personal, individual crisis. He was about to turn 40, such questions were natural\\". Indeed, \\"Um Morto de F√©rias\\" was taken by Pedro Alexandre Sanches, of Folha de S.Paulo, as a reference to mid-life crisis. When asked about an alleged teenage thematic in the lyrics, Britto replied that \\"to feel detached, with difficulties to adapt to the routine, is not a privilege of teenagers. This is something that we can have our whole life. You can be a father and not feel part of it\\". \\"Daqui Pra L√°\\" was inspired by the song \\"O Homem Que Deve Morrer\\" (The Man Who Must Die), composed by Nonato Buzar and written by Torquato Neto. In terms of sound, some critics saw a return to the band's heavier sound of the past. Negado, from Omelete, defined the album's sound as \\"basic pop rock\\". While some considered that \\"Um Morto de F√©rias\\" and \\"√â Bom Desconfiar\\" had a radiophonic pop appeal, \\"Vamos ao Trabalho\\" flirts with punk and \\"Eu N√£o Presto\\" borrows elemens from ska; \\"Mesmo Sozinho\\" is a melancholic ballad and forms a couple with the other ballad os the album, \\"Isso\\". \\"O Mundo √â B√£o, Sebasti√£o!\\" opens with a chord reminiscent of The Beatles' \\"Day Tripper\\". \\"Bananas\\" was defined as \\"funk- samba-rock\\" and \\"mangue beat\\" and \\"Vamos ao Trabalho\\" was compared to Cabe√ßa Dinossauro-era songs. Endino described A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana as follows:  Release and reception  A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana marks the first (and only) release by Tit√£s under Abril Music, which would close its doors less than two years later. The first 250,000 copies of the album were sold in newsstands in a package including a poster-magazine with stories, photonovel, curiosities and games of the band. The ideia came from the then president of the label, Marcos Mainardi, who intended to increase the CD's availability and decrease its price. The magazine format was adopted to evade a law that prohibited CDs from being sold in newsstands as individual products, but not as part of a bundle. The suggested price for it at the newsstands was R$19,90. = Commercial reception = The album was certified gold by ABPD in 2001, which meant 100,000 copies sold according to the criteria of the time. It wasn't as successful as most of Tit√£s' previous releases. = Critical reception = A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana received positive reviews by the critics. Writing for Allmusic, Philip Jandovsk√Ω stated that Tit√£s manages \\"to maintain a surprisingly high standard of rock music\\", classifying the album as solid, even if not considering it as inspired and creative as the first phase of the band, which he called \\"one of Brazil's most talented and interesting rock bands\\". Apoenan Rodrigues, from ISTO√â magazine, considered the album \\"fun\\" and \\"ironic starting with the title itself, [...] It makes the perfect mixture of palatable pop of more recent works like the acoustic projects and the sonic tons of Titanomaquia\\". He concluded by saying \\"the good sense mixed with the humour resulted in a CD for rocker parents and children.\\" Alexandre Nagado, from Omelete, considered that the album's 16 tracks \\"show a group that already took itself too seriously and now tries to get back to the simplicity path\\" and concluded his analysis saying that \\"the lyrics and melodies wander from rock to brega with a tranquility that will infuriate radical critics that are always saying Tit√£s are not the same anymore or that that which they do is disposable and commercial pop and not pure rock.\\" Pedro Alexandre Sanches, from Folha de S.Paulo, says the lyrics range from autocriticism to references to the so called \\"mid-life crisis\\" and concluded by saying: \\"for the ones who forgot about this, Tit√£s are still capable of doing open, new and creative music.\\" In a general comment about the band's discography, Cleber Facchi, from Miojo Indie, said \\"a considerable part of the album fuses the commercial side of the group with the sarcasm assumed since the 80s.\\" Track listing  Singles  \\"A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana\\" was released as the fourteenth single by the band and the first from the album in 2001. = Music video = The video for this song shows black & white images of the band in several situations. Branco Mello sings while having his hair cut, with Paulo Miklos sitting near him and holding a cigarette. Nando Reis is seen in a kind of food fair, and Charles Gavin visits a LP albums store.

Jaramillo graduated from Dallas's Sunset High School in 1970 and attended the University of Texas at Austin. He is best known for being a hitting coach at the major league level, most recently for the Chicago Cubs. During his time with the Texas Rangers, Jaramillo was the first individual in Rangers history to serve more than eight seasons on their major league coaching staff. He served as the Rangers' major league hitting coach for 15 seasons, from 1995 to 2009. Jaramillo also had the longest tenure with one team as a hitting coach in Major League Baseball (MLB). Jaramillo has been credited for the development of players such as Jeff Bagwell, Juan Gonz√°lez, Adri√°n Gonz√°lez, Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, Mark Teixeira, and Michael Young, among others. Playing career Before his coaching career, Jaramillo was a minor league outfielder from 1973 through 1976. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Jaramillo played four minor league seasons for the Rangers, but he never reached the major league level as a player. Coaching career Jaramillo started his minor league coaching career in 1983 and served as a manager in the minors from 1984 to 1986. He then became a minor league roving hitting instructor and worked in that capacity through the 1989 season. In 1990, Jaramillo joined the Houston Astros coaching staff after Art Howe was named the team manager. From 1990 through the 1993 season, Jaramillo was the Astros' major league batting coach, where offensive records were consistently broken each year, and Jeff Bagwell earned Rookie of the Year in 1991. He served as manager of the Bend Rockies for one season in 1994. Prior to the 1995 season, Jaramillo was named as the Texas Rangers' major league hitting coach. From 1996 through the end of the 2004 season, the Rangers ranked in the top five in the American League in team batting average, runs scored, slugging percentage, home runs, and hits. In 1999, the Rangers led all of MLB in hits, slugging percentage, and team batting average (.293 for the season). In 2005, the Rangers hit 260 home runs, the second-highest total in MLB history. In 2008, the Rangers were first in runs scored (901), hits (1619), and home runs (194). During his time with Texas, his hitters won 17 Silver Slugger Awards, four MVP Awards, three home run titles, two RBI championships, and a batting title. Jaramillo also guided the Rangers to 13-consecutive seasons in which the offense recorded more than 800 runs scored, the longest streak by any major league team since the New York Yankees accomplished the feat in 17-straight seasons from 1926-42. When the New York Mets were in search of a new major league manager in 2004, General Manager Omar Minaya interviewed Jaramillo as a possible managerial candidate. Jaramillo was among the final two candidates for the position, but Willie Randolph was ultimately selected as manager. Following the 2009 season, Jaramillo announced that he would not remain with the Rangers, opting to seek out other opportunities.http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/baseball/rangers/stories/101509dnsporanglede.3df6b97.html He officially signed with the Cubs on October 21, 2009, as their major league hitting coach.http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=4581458 While Jaramillo was credited with the development of young Cubs phenom Starlin Castro, he was dismissed by the team on June 12, 2012.The Cubs fire hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo Honors In 2003, Jaramillo was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame. He was the 2004 recipient of the Texas Rangers' Joe Macko Award, given to honor his long and meritorious service to the organization. In 2005, Baseball America named Jaramillo Major League Coach of the Year.Baseball America's 2005 Major League Coach of the Year He was awarded with the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame Pioneer Award at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas, on September 19, 2008.

It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 2012. Ice Mountain is protected by The Nature Conservancy and open for visits by small groups of hikers. It is nicknamed \\"Nature's Ice Box\\" and \\"Nature's Refrigerator\\" owing to its ice vents that release cool air all year long. Refrigeration The accumulated rock detritus at Ice Mountain's base forms a talus that is thick in some places. It creates a refrigeration effect. As cold air sinks into the talus pile during the cooler months it forms masses of ice and ice vents inside it. The ice vents are in a section about in length along Ice Mountain's southern flank. Cool air is expelled from the ice in the warmer months. Vent air temperatures vary throughout the year, but the mean annual temperature can be as low as 2 ¬∞C (35 ¬∞F). Within the area of ice vents there are approximately 60 different pockets and the cold air escapes through more than 150 small openings in the talus. The cool air affects surrounding air and soil around creating an area of boreal species and plant growth. Studies of Ice Mountain's geology, geomorphology, and micro-climatology since 2000 have shown that ice is no longer apparent after early June, but it is unclear whether this disappearance is due to climate change or the abandonment of historic ice storage strategies. Flora Ice Mountain's ice vents provide a habitat for boreal species of plants commonly found in Subarctic regions. The ecosystem exhibits a combination of Appalachian, Canadian, and Subarctic species in a humid subtropical climate. Northern boreal species have survived at Ice Mountain since the last glacial period and became isolated over time as temperatures warmed and relegated the boreal species to the Subarctic regions of North America. The cool air expulsed by the ice vents allowed boreal species to remain at Ice Mountain. Ice Mountain's boreal species are not only unique because of their isolated location, but also because of their elevation. Boreal species are typically found at elevations above mean sea level, but species at Ice Mountain survive at heights around above mean sea level. Boreal species at Ice Mountain include bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), Appalachian wood fern (Gymnocarpium appalachianum), Canada mayflower (Maianthemum canadense), minniebush (Menziesia pilosa), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), nannyberry (Viburnum lentago), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), prickly gooseberry (Ribes cynosbati), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), purple virgin's bower (Clematis occidentalis), shale barren primrose (Oenothera argillicola), skunk currant (Ribes glandulosum), starflower (Trientalis borealis), and twinflower (Linnaea borealis). Eastern Hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) provide shade to and cool the mountain's ice vents. The Appalachian wood fern, which grows on moss, was once thought to have been extinct but is found in abundance near the cold vents at the base of Ice Mountain. Parts of Ice Mountain are barren, but the majority of the ridge is covered in mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), sweet birch (Betula lenta), and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). Old growth species include chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), sweet birch (Betula lenta), and Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Ice Mountain's tree canopy also consists of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), eastern black oak (Quercus velutina), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black cherry (Prunus serotina), linden (Tilia americana), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and black walnut (Juglans nigra). West Virginia's state flower, the American rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum), grows in thick clusters along the lower mountainside of Ice Mountain. Fauna Ice Mountain provides habitats for breeding neotropical birds including warblers, vireos, and thrushes as well as various types of birds common in the central Appalachian Mountains. Ice Mountain also serves as a habitat for bald eagles and ravens, which nest in the mountain's Raven Rocks outcrop named for them. Other bird species include American goldfinch (Carduelis tristis), great crested flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and American black (Coragyps atratus) and turkey (Cathartes aura) vultures. Conservation The Nature Conservancy, with the help of volunteers, has worked to control non-native invasive species to protect and preserve Ice Mountain's rare and native plant species. These invasive species include tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), and Japanese stilt grass (Microstegium vimineum). The Nature Conservancy has also partnered with the United States Forest Service to prevent the deaths of eastern hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) due to the hemlock woolly adelgid. The Nature Conservancy has worked with West Virginia University geologists to preserve and prevent the mountain's ice vents from succumbing to effects associated with climate change. The melting of the ice vents warms the soil's temperature which threatens the survival of the boreal species that thrive there. The Nature Conservancy also continues to monitor the natural forest regeneration in the areas of Ice Mountain affected by a 2008 tornado. Guided hikes on Ice Mountain are offered on North River Mills and Ice Mountain Day in May and by appointment April through November. Geography and geology Ice Mountain is an arc-shaped forested ridge of the Allegheny Mountains, part of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. It is above mean sea level at its summit. Ice Mountain is a large mass of Devonian Oriskany (Ridgeley) sandstone and Marcellus shale with numerous bare rock slopes and vertical cliffs. Ice Mountain lies on the west side of the Timber Mountain anticline and to the west of North Mountain fault, which places it on the Martinsburg allochthonous sheet. Ice Mountain is situated along North River and is known for the several hundred yards of ice that form at its base all year long. At its southern end overlooking the community of North River Mills is located Raven Rocks, a set of stone chimney outcrops. Raven Rocks is in height above mean sea level with vertical cliffs measuring nearly in height. Raven Rocks were named because of the presence of ravens during pioneer days. The present Raven Rocks is the remaining vestige of a once towering cliff that overlooked the North River. Geologically, Ice Mountain is a northern extension of North River Mountain. History Ice Mountain has played a significant role in the history of the North River Mills community. Among Ice Mountain's earliest descriptions are mentions in Henry Howe's History of Virginia (1845) and in a Silliman's Journal article by Charles Hayden from the same year. Ice Mountain was also detailed in Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher's History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present (1897), O. F. Morton's History of Hampshire County (1910), and Homer Floyd Fansler's \\"Ice Mountain: Nature's Deep Freeze\\" in the July 1959 issue of West Virginia Conservation. The mountain was also featured in the April 1861 edition of Harper's New Monthly Magazine. The Harper's publishing company sent the article to the Winchester Star where it appeared in their October 10, 1962, issue. Ice Mountain earned its nicknames \\"Nature's Ice Box\\" and \\"Nature's Refrigerator\\" because of its use by Native Americans and early settlers for storage of perishable food items during the warmer months of the year. During the American Civil War, Ice Mountain was used as a lookout point while the surrounding area served as the scene of numerous small skirmishes. Thomas McMackin's Confederate militia company camped alongside North River at the base of Raven Rocks, where a sentinel was placed from daybreak to dusk. Around the late 19th and early 20th centuries, North River Mills residents would celebrate Independence Day and other occasions as late as September by digging up ice from the talus for the making of ice cream and lemonade. The mountain had through generations been owned by the Deaver family, the last of which was Mrs. Virginia Pugh. On September 22, 1962 Hampshire County farmer Otis Baker purchased the Ice Mountain and an adjacent for $23,000 at a public auction at the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney. Ice Mountain was purchased by The Nature Conservancy in 1991. = West Virginia state historical marker = Ice Mountain historical marker The text of the historical marker located at the U.S. Route 50/West Virginia Route 29 wye fork between Augusta and Pleasant Dale reads the following:  See also  * List of National Natural Landmarks in West Virginia * North River (Cacapon River) * North River Mountain * Climate change in West Virginia  References   External links   * * A Geological and Geophysical Investigation of Ice Mountain Algific Talus, Hampshire County, West Virginia * Dynamics of Cold Air Flow from Talus at the Ice Mountain Ecological Refugium, West Virginia, USA * Historic Hampshire: Aerial View of Ice Mountain * Ice Mountain Plant List Category:Algific talus slopes Category:American Civil War sites Category:Ridges of Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Hampshire County, West Virginia, in the American Civil War Category:Ice caves Category:Ridges of West Virginia Category:Nature Conservancy preserves Category:Nature reserves in West Virginia Category:Protected areas of Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Rock formations of West Virginia Category:National Natural Landmarks in West Virginia Category:IUCN Category V ","title":"Ice Mountain"},{"id":"7999996","text":"Holiday Harmony is the 15th studio album by American folk rock duo America, released by Rhino Records in 2002.

It was directed by Mitchell Leisen and produced by Harry Tugend from a screenplay by Frank Butler, Helen Deutsch and Abraham Polonsky, based on a novel by Jol√°n F√∂ldes. The music score was by Victor Young and the cinematography by Daniel L. Fapp. The film's haunting song, \\"Golden Earrings\\", sung in the movie by Murvyn Vye, was a hit recording in 1947-48 by Peggy Lee. Plot Starting in London, England in 1946 after World War II had been declared over, at a Hotel two items were delivered: a small package for a retired British Major General Ralph Denistoun, and a telegram for an American named Quentin Reynolds. The boy who was the bellhop dropped the telegram off to Quentin Reynolds first and he then took the small package across the room to Ralph Denistoun. When Ralph saw on the box where it had come from he got behind a curtain and opened it. The package had a pair of golden earrings in it. He then, using the window as a mirror, held one of the rings up to his pierced ears. Then when he found out that there was an airplane going from London to Paris France he got on it and was seated beside Quentin Reynolds who was also going to Paris. Quentin then asked Ralph Denistoun why has he kept the reason for his pierced ears a secret so long. Then Denistoun tells him the story of how before the war officially broke out he and another man named Richard Byrd were already in Germany and they were being held captive by a man named Hoff. Denistroun told how they plotted to escape from Hoff and get to the home of a Professor Otto Krosigk (who had developed a special poison gas formula) who was a friend to Richard Byrd's dad. Next he told Quentin how after they escaped from Hoff that they split up and he had come across a gypsy lady named Lydia who helped him get across country with her horse and wagon by dressing him up as a gypsy so the Nazis could not recognize him. They reached the city that Denistoun was to regroup with Byrd. Instead the Germans killed Byrd after he had tried by himself to reach Professor Krosigk. When Hoff and two of his men tried using a flame to make Byrd (who was dying) talk, Denistoun revealed himself and shot all three of the Nazis. Lydia and another Gypsy named Zoltan helped him get rid of the bodies and helped him get to Professor Krosigk's home. After some events happened when some German soldiers came to the professor's home too, the professor realized that Denistoun was telling the truth of who he was, so he gave to him the gas formula, written on a piece of German cash. Denistoun was able to get out of there with the formula and those soldiers did not know who he was. Lydia led him to a place near a river that would allow him to swim across the water to Switzerland with the piece of paper that had the formula intact in a special container. Ralph had taken the earrings and the coat off and given them back to Lydia before he went to the High Rhine and dived into the river. So after Denistoun had reached Paris he went out to the very place where he remembered leaving Lydia several years ago, and he saw her horse Apple and her wagon. He then put the earrings back on and did the gypsy tradition of spitting three times in the river before crossing. When he got up to the wagon he calls out to Lydia and she is so excited to see him. Then when the two of them get in the wagon she puts the coat back on him and they ride off to a happy ending Cast * Ray Milland as Ralph Denistoun * Marlene Dietrich as Lydia * Murvyn Vye as Zoltan * Bruce Lester as Richard Byrd * Dennis Hoey as Hoff * Quentin Reynolds as himself * Reinhold Sch√ºnzel as Prof. Otto Krosigk * Ivan Triesault as Maj.

He was based at the Shota Rustaveli Dramatic Theater in Tbilisi, and has staged productions throughout the world. Biography Sturua was born into an artistic family. His father, Robert, was a notable painter, whose works are part of the permanent exposition at the Tbilisi Art Museum. Mr Sturua is married to Dudana Kveselava, an art historian and an artist in her own right and daughter of Mikhail Kveselava, an accomplished philologist, writer and philosopher, who served as a translator at the Nuremberg trials. Sturua studied under Mikhail Tumanishvili at the Tbilisi State Theater Institute. Graduating in 1961, he began his career at the Shota Rustaveli Theater, where he became principal director in 1979 and principal artistic director in 1982. His first success came with staging of The Trial of Salem by Arthur Miller in 1965 (original title: The Crucibles). Later, Sturua mounted spectacular, offbeat productions of The Caucasian Chalk Circle by Bertolt Brecht (1975), Richard III (London and Edinburgh, 1979‚Äì80) and King Lear (New York, 1990), starring comic actor Ramaz Chkhikvadze. Starting with interpretations of Richard III and King Lear, Sturua became known as paradoxical interpreter of Shakespeare‚Äôs theater. Out of 37 Shakespeare plays, Sturua has staged 17; 5 of which at Rustaveli. Hamlet (1986) was staged for the Riverside Studio in London with Alan Rickman as Hamlet, and was hailed as one of ten best Shakespearian productions of the last 50 years by Shakespeare International Association. In the 1990s, Sturua's productions turned to the inner world. Works included Life is a Dream by Calder√≥n (1992), The Good Person of Szechwan by Brecht (1993), Gospel According to Jacob (1995, based on the Georgian ABC Book by Iakob Gogebashvili), Lamara by Grigol Robakidze (1996). Sturua's dialogue with the audience acquired an even more philosophical tone and focused more on thoughts of eternity, and on the fine line between life and death. The metaphorical language of more recent interpretations is palpably more poetic and includes the fantasy \\"Styx\\", inspired by the music of Giya Kancheli (2002); two new versions of Hamlet staged in Tbilisi (2001, 2006); and Waiting for Godot (2002). Dismissal In August 2011, Georgia's culture minister Nika Rurua dismissed Robert Sturua as head of the Tbilisi national theatre for \\"xenophobic\\" comments he made earlier this year, officials reported. \\"We are not going to finance xenophobia.

He was a great-grandson of Emperor Minh Mang, while his father was the minister of Interior during the reign of Bao Dai.

He was later released after a passionate appeal by elders of his parish. Five days later, the Vi·ªátc·ªông returned and searched his rectory. Seizing his binoculars, camera, typewriter and picture of H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, the troops led the priest, aged 57, and two seminarians away. His corpse was found on 8 November 1969 at Luong Vien, about 30 kilometers northeast of Hu·∫ø. The bodies of two other Catholic priests were in the same grave.

(Portuguese for \\"How Are You?\\") is the twelfth studio album released by Brazilian rock band Tit√£s. It was the first album by the band without vocalist/bassist Nando Reis and also the first without any contribution by guitarist Marcelo Fromer. Fromer died after being hit by a motorcycle on 11 June 2001, but his ideas were still used for their then upcoming album A Melhor Banda de Todos os Tempos da √öltima Semana which would be recorded a few days later. Reis left the group in 2002 stating he wasn't prepared to record another album due to still being shaken by the deaths of both Fromer and his friend C√°ssia Eller. It is also their first release via BMG, following Abril Music's bankrupt.  Background and concept  Commenting on the absence of Fromer and Reis, vocalist/keyboardist S√©rgio Britto said he believed the band \\"could compensate these absences. I'm not gonna say they are not missed, but we can make good albums with this personnel. Each one has potentialities - one plays the guitar, the other plays the bass, the other plays the drums and everyone composes.\\" Guitarist Tony Bellotto and vocalist Paulo Miklos also commented at that time about the band's capability of getting over the line-up losses. The name of the album was inspired by Confucius, via an idea that he used to support: \\"I asked with fire letters. How are you? How are all of us? The path is lost, we should judge.\\" According to Britto, \\"it could be how's the country, could be what we [the band] are going through. It's a simple title, with an open and interesting meaning\\". Its cover, created by notorious artist Rog√©rio Duarte, was explained by him in an interview for Correio Braziliense: \\"I thought of a tropicalist language, against that smooth thing, viewed as of fine taste. And a language that carried those references to the current government, to socialism, to MST. The red color even serves as criticism to the green and yellow\\". He commented further on the work in another interview, this time for Folha de S.Paulo:  Song themes  When asked about the possibility of the opening track \\"N√≥s Estamos Bem\\" (We Are Fine) being a message to the fans and the press, Britto said \\"yes, could be. But in the song we ask \\"how are you\\", and this can be understood in a wider sense. How is Brazil, how are the things through which we are going through. This sentence defines the intention of the album\\". The song \\"Enquanto Houver Sol\\" was included in the soundtrack of the 2003 Rede Globo telenovela Celebridade, which had Bellotto's wife Malu Mader in the lead role. The song \\"Pelo Avesso\\" was also used in another Rede Globo telenovela, 2009's Cama de Gato, appearing as the opening theme. \\"KGB\\" talks about fear for the return of torturers and extremists of KGB, Dops, CIA, Ku Klux Klan, Third Reich, etc. \\"As Aventuras do Guitarrista Gourmet Atr√°s da Refei√ß√£o Ideal\\" marks the second consecutive time an album by the band brings a tribute to Fromer. Track listing  Reception  Philip Jandovsk√Ω, from AllMusic, said the album is a return to rock from albums like Cabe√ßa Dinossauro and considered \\"impressive how Tit√£s manage to maintain a good quality, even after all these years and especially after high-profile bandmembers like Arnaldo Antunes and Nando Reis left the group\\". He also said fans would hardly be disappointed by the album, even though it was \\"far from reaching the vibrant energy of the glory days of the band\\". Pedro Alexandre Sanches, from Folha de S.Paulo, compared the album to the band's sophomore Televis√£o for mixing different tracks like the ironic and \\"classy punk rock\\" \\"A Guerra √â Aqui\\" with the optimistic and \\"loose pop rock\\" \\"Livres para Escolher\\". He also said the band came off unaltered by the exit of Nando Reis, whom he considered a \\"estraged body\\" in the band.
