A large area of the bog was bought by the Irish Peatland Conservation Council with funding from the Dutch Foundation for the Conservation of Irish Bogs in 1987. It was later handed over to the Irish state to be managed as a nature reserve. Scragh Bog is deemed to be Ireland's best example of a habitat transitioning from an alkaline fen to an acidic raised bog, one of only a small number still extant in Europe and of international importance. A large number of rare flora and insects in Europe have been recorded in the reserve. Some of the flora include sundew, round- leaved wintergreen, and sphagnum moss. The creation of the nature reserve was cited as the reason that a number of rare insects have been conserved in Ireland. Skylarks and common snipe live on the reserve.

Hansen. He is known for his writings as a member of the Danish resistance movement during the German occupation of Denmark in WWII. Several of his popular works have been translated into english, including: Lucky Kristoffer and The Liar. Hansen was awarded the Drachmannlegatet in 1946, De Gyldne Laurb√¶r in 1949, and the Holberg medal in 1952.  Personal life  Hansen was born on August 20, 1909 in Str√∏by, a small town on the Stevns peninsula in Denmark to Hans Peter Hansen (1878‚Äì1945) and Karen Christine Mariane Mathiasen (1885‚Äì1982). His father was a tenant farmer and his family had very little means. He had two sisters: Inger Elisabeth (b. 1911) and Karen Bodil (b. 1914). As a young boy, Hansen worked as a farmhand. He had been climbing an old beech tree to prune the spring shoots when the branch broke out from under him and he fell on his head. He recovered and finished his work, though from then on he was afflicted by migraines. His headaches were treated with aspirin, which he took in large qualities due to their severity. Hansen attended Haslev Seminarium and passed his examination to be a teacher in 1930. Hansen married Vera Louise Marie Jensen in 1935 and together they had two children: Hans-Ole Hansen, who became head of the Centre for Historical-Archaeological Research and Communication in Lejre, and their daughter Mette-Lise Hansen. While at a Nordic literature conference in Stockholm, Hansen accidentally ingested cleaning fluid and was rushed to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. This incident exacerbated the adverse effects on his kidneys caused by his frequent use of aspirin, which eventually resulted in nephritis. He died in Copenhagen on June 27, 1955 after being hospitalized Bispebjerg Hospital for chronic nephritis. He is buried alongside his wife at Allerslev Cemetery in Lejre.  Resistance writings  Hansen was deeply effected by the German occupation of Denmark during WWII and was active in the Danish resistance movement. Durring the occupation, he wrote anonymous articles in the then illegal publication Folk og Frihed (English: People and Freedom). When the publication's editors were arrested he took over, both writing and editing a large part of its contents. In the summer of 1944 Hansen had been living in a loft near Utterslev Mose. He referred to Utterslev Mose as \\"the bloody bog\\" (Danish: den blodige mose) because it was the site of many executions of suspected informants by the Danish resistance. To his dismay, Hansen was tasked with writing in defense of these executions, and he eventually published Dialogue on Murder and Responsibility (Danish: Dialog om drab og ansvar). The dialogue was an eleven- page debate between Socrates and his friend Simias which justified the executions of suspected informants, though it argued that those performing them should be brought to fair trial afterwords. Dialogue on Murder and Responsibility was highly controversial, though it inspired many young members of the resistance. Hansen wrote in a 1945 journal entry that he believed at least two young men, encouraged by his writings, had been killed after taking up arms. It was published in Morten Korch's anthology, Der br√¶nder en ild, along with works by other Danish resistance authors, such as Tove Ditlevsen, Hans Kirk, Ole Sarvig, and Halfdan Rasmussen. The anthology was originally published without naming its authors in order to protect their identities, though their names were released after the war. Hansen's participation in the resistance movement gained him notoriety and he became a well known author within Denmark. After the end of the occupation, he continued to debate political ideas as an editor and writer for Heretica. In particular, he argued that the perpetrators of executions during the occupation should be held accountable in a court trial since the Danish government had been restored, but after the war ended the leader of the resistance movement, Frode Jakobsen, made an agreement with the newly reestablished Ministry of Justice which ensured that the executions would not be investigated by the police and the assailants would not be prosecuted. Hansen considered this an injustice and held himself partially responsible for encouraging the executions though his writing at the time. In response, he wrote The Guests (Danish: G√¶sterne) a short story told from the perspective of an author who, like Hansen himself, had written a justification of extrajudicial killings. In the story, a man shows up on the narrator's doorstep with the body of a man he had executed. The visitor holds the author accountable for the man's death because he felt encouraged to perform the act after reading the author's work. Hansen had written The Guests in June of 1955 while hospitalized and because of his illness, he often lost consciousness while writing. He died just two weeks after he had finished the short story.  Works  Hansen's debut novel Nu opgiver han was published in 1935. The story depicts a farming community on the island of Zealand and their progressing disillusionment with life. These themes were continued in his 1937 novel Kolonien. His 1941 novel, Jonathans Rejse, follows Jonathan Smed as he outwits the devil by trapping him in a bottle and embarks to deliver him to his king. Through the course of his journey, the narrator is caught up in the struggle between good an evil and is confronted by the ambiguous and many faces of evil in his own world. Lucky Kristoffer (Danish: Lykkelig Kristoffer) was published in 1945, shortly before Denmark was liberated at the end of WWII. The novel is set durring the Count's Feud and narrated by a shopkeeper named Martin. Over the course of the story, Martin recounts his younger years traveling with Kristoffer, a young idealist who dedicated his life to protecting others as a knight and eventually died for his beliefs. As is characteristic of confessional writing, the narrator is forced to admit that while his lack of ideals had kept him safe, it made Kristoffer a more courageous man than he had been. In 1946, just after the end of WWII, Hansen published Tornebusken, a collection of short stories which addressed the darkness of the postwar atmosphere and attempted to derive meaning from the death and suffering caused by the war. The work's three stories include: ‚ÄùTornebusken,‚Äù ‚ÄùMidsommerfesten,‚Äù and ‚ÄùSeptembertaagen.‚Äù In 1947, Hansen published Agerh√∏nen, a collection of 12 short stories. Several of the stories in the collection drew upon to his own childhood experiences and centered on themes of life, death, and resurrection. His final collection of short stories, Paradis√¶blerne og andre historier, was published in 1953. Hansen was commissioned by Danmarks Radio to write a story to be read over the air and he eventually produced his novel The Liar (Danish: L√∏gneren). It was written as a series of diary entries from the perspective of Johannes Vig, an unreliable narrator and anti-hero who lies and manipulates the people close to him. The story follows Vig and his life on the island of Sand√∏ in post-war Denmark. The first section was narrated by actor Pouel Kern and aired over the radio in 1950. The novel was later released as a serial in the Danish newspaper Berlingske, and eventually published as a book in its entirety. In 1970, the work was converted into a film, which was written and directed by Knud Leif Thomsen. His 1952 novel, Orm og Tyr, details Scandinavia's transition from Norse paganism to Christianity and the duality of the region's resulting traditions. The novel's title is a reference to a legend in which a snake wraps itself around a village's church and the villagers are forced to raise a bull to fight it off. In the legend, the bull defeats the snake but is poisoned by its venom and dies on the steps in front of the church once the villagers regain access to their place of warship.

The film discusses true figures from the replanning of the Manchester slums from 1922 onward: 26,000 condemned; 14,000 demolished (plus \\"some help from Hitler\\"); 30,000 new houses planned. It stresses the need for a Green Belt around each town. Schools, hospitals and play areas are to be part of the plan. Old industries are discussed (and were in truth the hardest issue to address). The solution for relocating industries is not fully explained, and simply states that new areas will be zoned for industrial use - away from the housing. It explains how war has delayed the plan.

In 1943 she helped organize a strike against R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which attracted over 10,000 participants from Winston-Salem, North Carolina and led to the founding of the only union to be formed by Reynolds Tobacco employees. Hopkins was a leader in Local 22, a racially integrated union led primarily by Black women. Her efforts in fighting for higher pay and fair treatment made her a leader within the African American community of Winston-Salem. Early life and education Velma Hopkins was born February 24, 1909, the eldest of four children. Her mother was widowed before Velma was ten years old and the family moved to Winston-Salem. Activism at Reynolds Tobacco Hopkins started her career as a tobacco stemmer at the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. African Americans were rarely hired into higher paying jobs at the company, and women were paid less than men. Conditions at the company were harsh for those in lower paying jobs: Black employees worked in segregated areas with oppressive heat and dangerous tobacco dust. After the 1943 death of a coworker, Hopkins and others organized a walkout. City workers in other professions joined in the strike, and eventually more than 10,000 people walked picket lines outside of the company's headquarters. The workers formed an union, Local 22 of the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural and Allied Workers of America-CIO. Local 22 was racially integrated and led primarily by Black women. It was the only union in the history of Reynolds Tobacco. In 1944 Hopkins threw a switch cutting off power to all the machines at her plant, beginning a strike protesting low pay, long hours, and poor working conditions. Another major strike occurred in 1947. During the 1940s, Hopkins was one of the Local 22 leadership negotiating for pay raises, pay equity, and improved working conditions for Reynolds employees. The union's efforts gained national attention: Woody Guthrie and Paul Robeson both visited Winston-Salem to support Local 22. Describing how complaints increased after the union was formed, Hopkins explained that people had been too afraid to complain before the formation of the union, \\"I've got to work. I'm head of a household. I'm feeding children. Even though you ain't making but $9.35, that $9.35 meant survival. And once we got the union, they felt like, well, I've got some protection. I've got somebody that really cares.\\" Hopkins was disparaged and received death threats for her actions. Local press and the Reynolds leadership engaged in red-baiting and anti-union efforts, and Local 22 lost a decertification election in 1950. Later activism and legacy Hopkins's labor work made her a leader in the local Black community, and she continued her efforts fighting for civil liberties for African Americans. Her activism included helping Black people prepare for and pass voting tests and pushing for desegregation in schools. Hopkin's efforts in fighting for fair wages for thousands of Reynolds employees helped establish Winston-Salem's African American middle class community, leading the way to further strides forward in the emerging civil rights movement. North Carolina State Senator Earline Parmon was mentored by Hopkins and described Hopkins as \\"instrumental in shaping her and a generation of local black leaders\\".

Preceded by the title track, it will be their first album to be released with their new record label BMG on 27 November 2020. They had originally intended to release the project in the Spring, however the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and imposing of lockdown resulted in a temporary announcement of promotion. Background Steps came off of their planned break in 2017 in celebration of their twentieth anniversary of their formation. It was revealed that they would be releasing their fifth studio album, Tears on the Dancefloor in April followed by the Party on the Dancefloor Tour in November. On 7 September 2020, Steps announced the release of their sixth studio album, called What the Future Holds, via their social media accounts. It was revealed by a series of enigmatic posts, with references to the past and the future, as well as imagery of a crystal ball. It was followed by a message posted on their official Twitter account saying \\"We couldn't keep it a secret any longer!!\\", with band member Claire Richards adding \\"Its been a long time coming but we are so proud to present the next chapter to the Steps story.\\" The title track was revealed as the lead single on the same day while a supporting arena tour of the United Kingdom was announced on 8 September, set to take place in November 2021. Title and theme The title of the album, its musical composition, artwork and promotional campaign originated solely from the name of the title track, \\"What the Future Holds\\". Written by Sia and Greg Kurstin, the song's lyrics are \\"a reflection how they feel now as a group and how far they've come\\" since their formation 23 years prior. In an interview with the Official Charts Company, Ian \\"H\\" Watkins explained that the group decided to record another album following the release of their fifth studio album Tears on the Dancefloor (2017) and the completion of its supporting arena tour, the Party on the Dancefloor Tour, purely based on the sound of the song alone. The concept of the lyrics \\"One foot in the past, one foot in the future\\" is a reflection of where Steps are in their career and provides the basis for the project and upcoming tour, with Faye Tozer stating that the latter will consist of the \\"nostalgia\\" of their back catalogue while contemporaneously blending it with their new music. Release The album was announced via their official group social media on 7 September 2020, with a release date set for 27 November; it is their first album to be released with their new record label, BMG. Steps had originally planned to announce the release of the album and its accompanying What the Future Holds Tour earlier in the Spring of 2020, however the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown restrictions resulted in a temporary pause to the promotional campaign to Autumn, when the group announced that they could no longer keep the project a secret. Speaking about the eventual announcement, Lee Latchford-Evans commented in an interview with Sky News that the general response was people saying \\"Steps have saved 2020\\" and that it was a positive feeling that despite the uncertainty around the pandemic, it was \\"nice to have people be very positive towards us again.\\" He continued to reveal that the group had first heard the title track during their Party on the Dancefloor Tour nearly three years prior, while they were deciding whether or not to \\"carry on\\" with potentially recording new music after the tour; the music video was filmed almost a year earlier in preparation for the original Spring release. Richards added that the timing of the announcement was not in order to seek advantage in a \\"horrendous situation,\\" describing the album's title as coincidental, and that it felt like the right time after having worked on the project for several years.

After an opportunity arose to join the research group of Hall as a scientist, Morris moved to the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), where he started a graduate programme in atmospheric science. Throughout his graduate studies he worked as an instructor at Spelman College. His doctoral research considered atmospheric inorganic chlorine oxides (peroxides), and he was awarded a NASA graduate research fellowship to support his studies. His worked combined experimental and theoretical investigations to better understand how chlorine oxides contributed to the depletion of stratospheric ozone. In 1991, Morris became the first African-American to earn a doctorate in atmospheric science at Georgia Tech. After completing his doctorate, Morris moved to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he was made a Ford Foundation fellow.  Research and career  Morris joined the University of California, Davis, where he was awarded a President's Postdoctoral Fellowship. At UC Davis, Morris studied the dynamics of free radical systems. In 1996 Morris moved to Howard University, where he was appointed Deputy Director of the Center for the Study of Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Atmospheres. His research looks to understand how atmospheric particulates influence the atmosphere and climate across multiple spatio-temporal scales. He served as Director of the Howard University component of the Goddard Space Flight Center Earth Science and Technology Center. In this capacity, Morris spent two years at Goddard, where he studied the movement of aerosols and dust from Asia across the Pacific Ocean. At Howard University, Morris was the founding director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Cooperative Science Center in Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology. His research considered trace gases and aerosols in the urban environment. To understand the impact of these at a global scale, Morris directed several observation missions on board the NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown. Amongst these missions were the AERosols and Oceanographic Science Expeditions (AEROSE), which involved investigations into the air mass outflows of Africa. These outflows included particulates from the Sahara desert and aerosols from the burning of biomass due to slash-and-burn agriculture. Such aerosols can influence the transfer of microbes across hemispheres (microbiological transfer), which can impact cloud formation and precipitation. Through these investigations Morris was able to create the world's most comprehensive data set of atmospheric measurements and oceanographic information. These studies permit the characterisation of the environmental impacts of Saharan dust aerosols as they move across the Atlantic Ocean. In July 2020 Morris joined the faculty at Arizona State University as the Director of the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences.  Academic service  As of 2017, in the United States, fewer than 0.1% of geoscience doctoral students are African American or Native American. In an interview with Chalkdust magazine, Morris remarked, ‚Äúif you never see any African American professors, or very rarely see them, then you don‚Äôt see yourself becoming one, and you say to yourself maybe I should do something else,‚Äù. Morris has dedicated his scientific career to mentoring students and early career researchers from underserved backgrounds. In 2001 Morris founded the Howard University (HU) Graduate Program in Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS), which was the first atmospheric science doctoral programme at a minority serving institution. Under his leadership, HUPAS became a national leader in the graduation of minority atmospheric science researchers; between 2006 and 2016 HUPAS produced half of all African-American doctoral graduates in the United States. Alongside working to support early career researchers, Morris has created educational programmes for young people. He designed a series of weather camps for students in the United States and Puerto Rico, which included courses in weather, climate and the environment. Almost 70% of the students who participate in the weather camps are African-American or Latinx. During his time at Howard University, Morris encouraged his research group to visit schools in the District of Columbia Public School system and lead interactive education programmes as part of a ‚Äòtravelling science show‚Äô which became known as Community Science Fests. Beyond Washington, D.C., these events took place in Brazil, Barbados, Uruguay, the Philippines, Ethiopia and Sudan. He has worked with Talitha Washington on programmes that promote STEMM diversity. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences Board on Atmospheric Science and the Climate.

Twin Brothers is situated one half mile immediately north of The East Temple, and one half mile immediately south of Mountain of the Sun, towering 2,800-feet (850 meters) above the floor of Zion Canyon. It is set on the east side of the North Fork of the Virgin River which drains precipitation runoff from this mountain. Its neighbors across the canyon include Bee Hive, The Sentinel, and Mount Moroni. Mount Spry, set southwest and below Twin Brothers, often appears in photos taken of both from park headquarters. This feature's name was officially adopted in 1934 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Twin Brothers. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

The publication was later relocated to Ozona in April 1912; and in June 1912, the magazine announced it was relocating its publication to San Antonio. Some years later, the Hunters encountered difficulties due to lack of support & low subscriber count. In May 1916, Hunter founded the Frontier Magazine, published in Melvin till 1917.

Designed by Joseph Whitworth, the gun was most notably used during the American Civil War.  Description  The 12-pdr rifle was designed in the early 1850s by British manufacturer Joseph Whitworth, who had recently been contracted to improve the Pattern 1853 Enfield. During his experiments with the Enfield, Whitworth was inspired to begin experimenting with a hexagonally-rifled barrel; Whitworth would later apply these principles to his field guns. Along with Whitworth's smaller 3-pdr gun, the artillery piece was considered for adoption by the British government's Board of Ordnance. However, Whitworth's guns eventually lost out to the Armstrong gun. During the American Civil War the weapon was exported and saw service in the Union and Confederate armies, though it was considered a rarity. From a design standpoint, the weapon was unique. Like all of Whitworth's designs, the weapon had a distinctive hexagon-ally rifled barrel and was a breechloader (though it could be loaded via the muzzle with modifications). The cannon was forged using a method in which iron plates would be overlapped and forced together using hydraulic presses. The 12-pounder Whitworth saw service with the Army of Northern Virginia. One Whitworth was used in the Confederate defense of Charleston.Beauregard, G. T. \\"Defense of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1862, 1863 and 1864.

It is the main source of power to the south of the country. Due to fluctuating water levels and to poor maintenance of the plant and transmission network it often delivers far less than its nominal 74 megawatts. Technical The Moukoukoulou hydroelectric power station includes a concrete dam with a free spillway, a water intake fitted with fine grids, head valves, supply and penstock pipes, a plant and an outdoor station. The nominal drop height is . The power plant has four 18.5 megawatt turbine/generator sets, giving total power of 74 megawatts. There are two 45 megavolt-ampere transformers, with two sets per transformer. The output voltage is 11 kilovolts and discharge voltage is 110 kilovolts. The electricity is fed into the transmission network which includes 110 kV transformer stations at Bouenza Il, Nkayi and Loudima, and 35 kV transformer stations at Lout√©t√©, Madingou and Dolisie. In 1985 the plant had a maximum energy output of 400 GWh/year, but only half of that was being absorbed by the network due to lack of a connection to Brazzaville. About 240 GWh was generated in the wet season, and 160 GWh in the dry season. During the low water period of June, July and August the guaranteed power output is no more than 30 MW. A 2004 report recommended creation of a water retention structure to guarantee full power output throughout the year. History The Moukoukoulou hydroelectric power plant is the most important in the country. Construction started under the presidency of Marien Ngouabi within the Sino- Congolese cooperation framework. The dam was built by Chinese technicians in 1974. The power plant was commissioned in 1979. A 1988 UNDP / World Bank report noted that the Moukoukoulou power plant was in a deteriorating condition. A single 225 kW/110 kV line linked Moukoukoulou to Pointe-Noire, so that city was vulnerable to power failures. The Soci√©t√© Nationale d'Electricit√© (SNE) had two independent networks, one centered on Brazzaville and the other on Pointe-Noire. A 225 kV line linking the networks was expected to be operational by late 1988. This would allowing surplus capacity from Moukoukoulou to be directed to Brazzaville and reduce the need for imports from Zaire. Extensive work was needed at Moukoukoulou on the ancillary equipment and other problems had to be resolved to improve output and reliability. In April 1998 Cocoye insurgents captured the Moukoukoulou Hydroelectric Dam, killing several employees and cutting off the electric supply to Pointe-Noire for several weeks. The plant was damaged, and since then only provided 25 MW. In April 2002 a mutiny by 21 government troops demanding payment of their salaries led to power being cut from the Moukoukoulou dam. This caused an electricity blackout in the south of the country. On 2 May 2002 the troops were dismissed from the army. A 2005 OECD report noted that during the civil war the hydroelectric plants had been badly damaged, and there were severe shortages of water and electricity. The equipment of the SNE was decrepit and operating at only 1/3 of its capacity. Repairs to the high-voltage line between Moukoukoulou and Brazzaville were expected to start soon. In May 2007 President Denis Sassou Nguesso visited Moukoukoulou, where all four turbine generators had been rehabilitated at a cost of US$12 million, although work on the transformers was still not complete. Damage to the transmission network was preventing its power from reaching Brazzaville, which was relying on power from the Inga plants in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The rehabilitation work was carried out by Chinese technicians with funding of 6 billion CFA francs from the Congolese government. In 2017 the SNE president Eug√®ne Ondzambe Ngoyi asked the government to fund a general overhaul of the equipment at Moukoukoulou. Since 1979 there had been only three general overhauls in 34 years, although the recommended frequency was every four years. On 29 July 2018 the SNE was dissolved and its assets and staff were transferred to the new limited company Energie Electrique du Congo (E2C). In October 2018 the Ministry of Energy and Hydraulics invited expressions of interest from private companies to rehabilitate, modernize and operate the Moukoukoulou hydroelectric power station.

He was an important leader in Kuva-yi Milliye of the Aegean Region. After the declaration of the Turkish Republic he was granted land in Hacƒ±haliller, Manisa for his services and lived in Manisa until his death.  Early years  Mehmet was born in Baraklƒ± Cuma, a town north of Serres in Ottoman Greece. At an early age he became a Pehlivan, which is a common sport in his native town. Being a remarkable wrestler he received the title \\"parti\\" which means that he was always wrestling with the winner of the tournaments. According to his descendants he killed a local Greek and went up to the Mountains of Macedonia. During the long years of Macedonian Struggle he was in the mountains fighting against Bulgarian Komitadjis and Greek Makedonomachoi but occasionally he banded with Christians against the oppressive rule of Abdulhamid II.

He participated in supressing many internal rebellions such as the Revolt of Ahmet Anzavur and the revolt by the caliphate supporters by Kuva-yi Inzibatiye. After learning the betrayal of √áerkes Ethem he broke ties with him and surrendered to the Turkish National Army stating that he was not part of the betrayal. On January 1, 1921, he wrote a letter to Ismet Pa≈üa the commander of Western front explaining the situation he was put in by √áerkez Ethem's betrayal, asking for consideration and understanding. Subsequently, on June 6, 1921, he was pardoned and ordered by Ismet Pa≈üa to stay behind enemy lines and act as guerilla fighter. He joined to the Governor of Simav who also was a Rumelian Turk from Melnik. Thus, he was assigned as the commander of the 11th Raider \\"Akƒ±ncƒ±\\" detachment, tasked with the districts of Demirci and Simav. He married the daughter of Molla Mehmed to gather support from Anatolian Turks in the mountainous vicinity of who was widowed during the Great War. His wife was captured by the Greek Army and was held as hostage nearly for a year. Greek officers tried to recruit him for the Greek side on many occasions, but he always refused with a very harsh language. On June 24, 1922, he replied to the previous letter (written on 7/06/1922) from the Commander of the Greek forces in G√∂rdes: \\"Senin iyi, kurnaz bir adam olduƒüunu biliyordum...

It was founded as the Toronto office of Campbell Ewald in 1923 to handle General Motors Canada's advertising account and was purchased by Jack MacLaren, who renamed it, in 1935, and made it an independent firm. The firm is best known for launching the General Motors Hockey Broadcast in 1931 when it acquired exclusive radio broadcasting rights for games held in Maple Leaf Gardens. The programme initially aired on the CN Radio network. The series transferred to CNR's successor, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission and became the Imperial Esso Hockey Broadcast in 1934, when Imperial Oil became its sponsor, and then Hockey Night in Canada in 1936 when it began airing on the CRBC's successor, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. MacLaren Advertising would produce the programme in collaboration with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation until 1988. The agency became a leader in Canadian advertising, and was the first advertising agency in Canada to have a radio department, research department, direct mail and sales promotion department, as well as a poster and store display division. As it grew, it established branches in Montreal, Quebec City, and London, Ontario. It acquired the Norris-Patterson agency in 1942, and by 1954 was one of the top 50 companies in North America. MacLaren expanded further, establishing branch offices in Vancouver, Winnipeg and Ottawa. In the 1950s and 1960s, MacLaren was the largest ad agency in Canada and its staff produced 85% of TV network programming after CBC Television started broadcasting in 1952. More recently, the firm was responsible for Molson's ‚ÄúI Am Canadian‚Äù campaign and the ‚ÄúBuilt For Drivers‚Äù platform for Pontiac and a series of ads for Sunlight detergent in the 1980s. In the 1970s, it acquired agencies in London and Paris and opened an office in Nassau. In 1988, the firm was acquired by Lintas Worldwide which renamed the firm MacLaren:Lintas.

Ibn  øAl·∏≥ama was descended from a mawlƒÅ (freedman) of  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn ibn Umm al-·∏§akam, the governor of K≈´fa in Iraq in 678 under the first  øUmayyad caliph, Mu øƒÅwiya I.

When the  øUmayyad prince  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I made his play to restore  øUmayyad rule in al-Andalus in 755, Ibn  øAl·∏≥ama was one of the first to rally to his banner after the  øUmayyad's agents met with al- ·π¢umayl ibn ·∏§ƒÅtim in Zaragoza.

It was founded on the Langenberg south of Harlingerode; however, the only remainders are located on the north side.  Geology  The Langenberg, internationally known for the discovery of Europasaurus and part of the Northern Harz Boundary Fault north of the Harz, consists of Korallenoolith with layers of chalky iron ore, containing up to 25% iron. On the northern part of the Hansa pit, limonite was more predominant and fossils of Orectolobiformes indet. were found.Hansa iron mine at Fossilworks.org  History  = 19th century = On behalf of consul Herrmann Henrich Meier, local geologist and director for mining administration Wilhelm Castendyck discovered the iron deposits beneath the Langenberg in the mid-19th century.Information page in woick-wandern.de, last checked on September 10, 2020 (German). Translation: Hansa Pit: The Hansa Pit is directly related to the Friederike Pit in B√ºndheim. On behalf of smelting facility director Wilhelm Castendyck and consul H. H. Meier from Bremen, their operation was started in the mid-19th century. The exact date of the Hansa Pit's start is unknown. First recordings reach back to the year of 1862. The pit was closed and re-opened multiple times, as in 1935. Operation ended on August 23, 1960.  Hermann deposit  The earliest deposit, the Hermann deposit, was first mentioned in 1860 and established soon after that. It was located north of the Langenberg, where the remaining area around the opening hole is conserved nowadays. In order to reach the significant pyrolusite conglomerate beneath the Langenberg, a tunnel with a length of 187 metres was drilled. However, due to the strong mountain pressure and brittle rock, the tunnel needed further support and it was decided to extend the tunnel west- and eastwards instead. Due to unprofitability, the Hermann deposit was abandoned in 1867.Alfred Breustedt: Eisenerzgrube Hansa (Hansa iron ore pit). In: 950 Jahre Harlingerode, 2003, p. 83f.  Hansa deposit  The relevant Hansa deposit was first documented in 1862. It was discovered as a characteristic Korallenoolith deposit in the R√∂seckenbach valley west of G√∂ttingerode and southwest of the Langenberg. From here on, the seam was mined eastwards as far as to the outskirts of Schlewecke around 1.5 kilometres east. A new area with the official name Hansa Pit was founded on June 3, 1865, west of where G√∂ttingerode was founded later. Due to the very poor condition of roads at the location, the mine was temporarily closed in November 1865 until conditions improved.Alfred Breustedt: Eisenerzgrube Hansa (Hansa iron ore pit). In: 950 Jahre Harlingerode, 2003, p. 84 = 20th century = The aftermath of the Great Depression caused the mine to be temporarily shut down on March 15, 1932. However, due to the German Nazi Party's plans to gain more autarky with their ressources, the mine was put back into operation on November 1, 1935. In order to provide sufficient living space for the necessary workers, the G√∂ttingerode settlement was erected south of the Langenberg and next to the Hansa pit. In 1938-39, a connection to the Oker‚ÄìBad Harzburg railway was established by erecting a chain conveyor to the Harlingerode station. The Hansa pit was closed on August 23, 1960, due to lack of profitability.  References   Further reading  * Alfred Breustedt: Eisenerzgrube Hansa. In: 950 Jahre Harlingerode.

In 2012, the court ruled the acquittal of Ahmed Adel, a recruited doctor in the Egyptian army who conducted the operation to examine the activists' virginity.  Background  Tahrir Square witnessed clashes between supporters of the continuation of the sit-in in the square and those calling for its evacuation, and soldiers and men in civilian clothes destroyed the protesters camps in the middle of Tahrir Square, where people have been camping sporadically since January 28. Military officers arrested at least 20 women, in addition to at least 174 men, and took them all to the Egyptian Museum, where the army had set up a temporary base since the January protests, and tortured them. Human Rights Watch documented how the army beat, flogged, kicked men, hit women, chained them to an iron fence, and shocked them with electricity. Activists said that they were assaulted and beaten inside the Egyptian Museum, and they said that about 17 girls and more than 500 young men who were arrested were taken into custody , and some women activists were arrested and taken to a military zone called Q28 and virginity tests were conducted for them according to two of them and other witnesses.

It follows two directionless young women who must figure out how to save the Universe. The first season of the series, consisting of six 15-minute episodes, premiered on Syfy's late night programming block TZGZ on September 26, 2020.  Plot  In this female-driven comedic series, Alex (Brunson) and Daisy (Akana), two women in their early 20s, are given the duty of protecting the universe while getting their lives together and pay rent to their demanding landlord.  Cast and characters  = Main = * Quinta Brunson as Alex, who thinks of becoming a barista at a coffee ship in the local area, before meeting Nut. * Anna Akana as Daisy, a friend of Alex, who loves the John Wick franchise like Alex. She is also a stoner and antihero. She also reportedly slept with all the baristas at the local coffee shop, including Michaela, and the No Tattoo Barista. Her ex-girlfriend is revealed to be working at the urgent care clinic in the show's fourth episode. * Ana Gasteyer as Nut, a red panda who gives Daisy and Alex the ability to transform into magical girls, allowing them to work together to \\"save the Universe from otherworldly threats.\\" * Matteo Lane as Corvin, the evil henchman of Verus. As such, he is part of Arregon, the evil corporation in Brooklyn, which is presumably run by Verus. = Recurring = * Christine Baranski as Verus, an \\"icy and efficient omni-universal being.\\" * Manny Jacinto as Coffee Dude, an optimist who Alex has a crush on. * Helen Hong as Daisy's mother Like her husband, she is part of a religious fundamentalist cult. * Eric Bauza as Daisy's father. He is part of a religious fundamentalist cult. * Sarah ‚ÄúSquirm‚Äù Sherman as Lulu, a old man, and landlord, who dislikes late rent and millennials. * Stephanie Sheh * Taylor Ortega * Daisy Hobbs = Guests = * Jason Mantzoukas as The Emptier * Paget Brewster as Gloriana * Vella Lovell as CBD Monster, which saps energy from those at a favorite coffee spot of Daisy and Alex through the use of CBD and wreaks havoc. She is the first monster defeated by Daisy and Alex. Although she transforms from her original form as the \\"No Tattoo Barista,\\" her ultimate fate is not known. * Patti Harrison as The Mushroominations * Jamie Loftus as Nightscreamr, a \\"goth bully.\\"  Episodes   Production  = Development = Magical Girl Friendship Squad was created by Kelsey Stephanides, who is also the showrunner, and is inspired by anime, riffing off the magical girl genre popularized by Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura. The show was made, according to Stephanides, between the end of 2019 to August 2020, after it was pitched to SYFY, which wanted a polished reboot with \\"longer episodes.\\" In January 2020, TZGZ, Syfy's new adult animation block, ordered six 15-minute episodes to series. At the same time, the short form version, Magical Girl Friendship Squad: Origins, began airing on Syfy's late-night block. Also anime-inspired like the main series, this pilot series was written by Diana McCorry, who created Human Kind Of and features show's two same protagonists. Stephanides stated that she was influenced by series such as The Simpsons and Futurama but that they had mostly male casts, making her think about \\"what a show with a mostly female cast would look like\\" beginning in 2015. She then decided to make a parody of the magical girl subgenre, using Rick & Morty and Archer as a basis. In the same interview, she stated that the themes of the show are about what it's like \\"to gain and hold power as a woman today\\" without losing a part of yourself, building upon the setup of the characters in the pilot series. Furthermore, she stated that the themes of friendship and honesty are key to the series, as is the message that people are stronger when they are \\"more open\\" and connect with others. She also hoped that the series expands the \\"types of new animated stories\\" with more variety in adult animation. She also noted that the show is anime-inspired, not anime itself, despite the number of anime references in the show's backgrounds, while hoping for \\"different ways\\" to do adult animation in the future. In February, all the voiceovers for the show's six episodes were recorded, resulting in Akana getting \\"really, really sick after recording everything,\\" with Daisy's voice not in her \\"natural register,\\" making it rough. Some of the recording was finished up in early March just before the pandemic hit. Months later, in early September, Stephanides made similar points as she had in the interview with Comics Beat but added that she wanted to make a \\"genderbent\\" version of previous adult animations that was more feminine in its themes, leading her to the magical girl genre, specifically a genre parody. She further noted that because of the show she is getting back into watching anime like Kill la Kill, One-Punch Man, and Mob Psycho 100 and stated that the show is trying to modernize the magical girl genre. Additionally, she commented about how it was easy to work with Brunson and Akana, that the red panda was chosen to differentiate from a cat as a magical familiar, the \\"adjustment period\\" that Daisy and Alex have to go through before they become magical girls, and the experience of having Stephanie Sheh do voice work on the show. She hoped, at the same time, this would encourage more networks and platforms to create adult animations like it, while inspiring others to make their own unique shows. The next month, Marika Cowan, character designer of the show, shared her designs for the No Tattoo Barista and her form as the CBD Monster from the show's first episode, noting the fun in designing the character and saying she \\"referenced a LOT of Sailor Moon monsters when developing her look.\\" =Release= On July 24, members of the show's cast and crew talked about the show in a panel for Comic Con. See 20:59-33:32 in this video. A number of sneak peeks of the show ere also shown at the time. Two months later, on September 16, an exclusive sneak peek of the series was uploaded to the YouTube channel of SYFY. The series premiered on September 26, 2020 alongside the network's other animated series debut Wild Life. Before the show's official release, the show's writer, Hallie Cantor, described the show as featuring \\"dangerously horny teens,\\" \\"snake demon ex-girlfriends,\\" and other aspects, while noting that all six episodes of the show will be available on Syfy's website with a login, while the first episode will be free to stream on the same website. Some of these aspects are noted in her later tweet, which is the last one in this thread, after she thanks the cast and crew. = Crew = The show is produced by Cartuna, a New York animation studio, with each producer having their own style. As Stephanides put it, the show would have been \\"totally different\\" if another studio produced it. Krystal \\"K\\" Downs is the animation director. Cartuna worked with over 100 artists on the series. Hallie Cantor is the lead writer and co-executive producer with James Belfer, Adam Belfer and Max Benator. The two Belfers are also executive producers on the pilot series. Additionally, Marika Cowan is a character designer. = Casting = In May 2020, it was announced that Quinta Brunson and Anna Akana were leads of the show's ensemble cast. As Stephanides explained it, Akana voiced Daisy in the pilot series, but that in the main series they wanted to \\"do a bit more character development,\\" whereas for Brunson it was different. Instead, in the words of Stephanides, she \\"added a new layer to Alex's personality.\\" Brunson stated that she joined the cast because representation in anime as a Black woman was the reason to join in, and that she agreed with all of the material, especially the content about \\"outrage culture.\\" In September, Matteo Lane said he loved playing a villain like Corvin, noting the magical girl anime influences, and said that a lot is packed in each episode, even saying the character has a \\"gay voice.\\" He even speculated what totem would allow Corvin to transform if he could do so, while saying that people should take away that there can be diverse representation among superheroes. He also revealed that he had done recordings of his lines three times because of the pandemic and ambient noses in New York City, while hoping that in a possible Season 2 his character would get a boyfriend. The following month, Brunson said that she enjoyed playing the character, calling it a lot of fun, and about the transition from stand-up comedy to voice acting. Summary of interview by Julian Cannon She also stated that the voice of Alex was not the far removed from her actual voice, while trying to make her more optimistic rather than deadpan, and noted that she was sent an offer to voice this character and didn't have to audition for any others. Reception Reception to the series has been mixed. Complex called the series a cross between Sailor Moon and Broad City, and commented on the \\"satirical diatribes on internet outrage culture and celebrity.\\" By contrast, The A.V. Club was more critical. They stated that the series spins touted aspects of millennial culture with \\"anime-inspired lore and imagery,\\" even as it relies on some tropes, and praised the charm of cast, along with the \\"faintest promise of adventure.\\" However, they stated that the show functions best when lingering \\"on the show's core friendship,\\" while it does not, in the end, become an animation which is \\"something special.\\" This contrasted with the assessment by Comic Book Resources. Their reviewer said that the series shows \\"plenty of promise,\\" praised the \\"distinct art style,\\" saying it feels like a \\"webcomic come to life,\\" with occasional stiff (and jerky) movement. Even so, they argued that the vocal talents of Brunson and Akana, compliment each other well in this comedic series which has a \\"mature sense of humor, drug use and language.\\" Notes  References   External links  * Category:2020s American animated comedy television series Category:Animated television series about extraterrestrial life Category:English-language television shows Category:Syfy original programming Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:TZGZ Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:2020s American adult animated television series Category:LGBT-related animated series Category:Magical girl television series ","title":"Magical Girl Friendship Squad"},{"id":"65254944","text":"The 1928 St. Louis Stars baseball team represented the St. Louis Stars in the Negro National League during the 1928 baseball season.

The term is used mostly in the United States by gun control advocates, gun rights advocates, law enforcement, and some in the firearm industry. Un-serialized guns are in general legal. By making guns themselves, owners are usually not subject to federal or state commercial background check regulations.  Production  = United States = Under U.S. federal law, the creation and possession of firearms for non- commercial purposes has always been legal. In contrast, firearms for sale or distribution require a federal license for their manufacture, and must bear unique serial numbers. A firearm receiver, which under US law is most often the part legally considered to be a \\"firearm,\\" can be completed from raw material, an \\"unfinished receiver,\\" or a so-called \\"80% receiver,\\" the last of these being a non-legal term the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, or ATF, does not recognize. While some states have passed laws restricting the creation of ghost guns, in most states unfinished receivers are sold without the requirement of federal or state background checks. Finishing work on these receivers may be performed with machine tools, the common drill press, or hand-held tools like the Dremel. Companies sell kits that include drill bits, stencils, and jigs to aid the process, but proficiency with tools is usually required. It has always been possible to make firearms from raw materials, and more recently it has become popular to produce receivers from plastic with a 3D printer, though the variety of materials and methods used to create these produce receivers of greatly varying quality. The most popular machine tool for completing 80% receivers is a CNC mill by Defense Distributed named Ghost Gunner, which is optimized for completing aluminum and steel unfinished receivers. AR-15-style firearms are often made as ghost guns. AR-15s are modular firearms, and maker's marks are usually applied to the lower receiver, which houses the trigger group. A person with an AR-15 lower receiver can assemble a complete weapon using widely available components, such as barrels, stocks, magazines, and upper receivers. Pistols and AK-47-style semi-automatic rifles are also popularly made as ghost guns. = Non-US Jurisdictions = Overseas production centers of unmarked firearms include China, the Khyber Pass area of Pakistan and the Philippines; the Philippines are especially known for the production of .45 caliber semi-automatic pistols.  Political Controversy  = Traceability = In recent years, politicians and gun control advocates have claimed tracing ghost guns used in crimes may be harder than tracing their commercial variants. This argument is made when assessing ATF's ability to use the serial numbers of firearms associated with crimes to perform \\"trace requests\\" through The National Tracing Center (NTC), a division of the bureau that provides investigative leads for local, state, federal and foreign law enforcement agencies. However, ATF NTC uses other technologies and forensic expertise when serial numbers are not present, or have been altered or obliterated from firearms, and local detectives, prosecutors and U.S. Attorneys have many other resources and investigative powers aside from NTC when working gun crimes, including the NIBIN. Additionally, as was seen in Operation Fast and Furious the ATF was unable to trace their own guns that had serial numbers. While there are no reliable statistics on how many privately made firearms are being recovered in crimes, since the issue rose to prominence in California, ATF has documented recoveries of ghost guns in 38 States plus DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. ATF noted an increasing number of ghost gun seizures every year since 2016, and over 1,600 of these firearms have been entered into NIBIN. = Advocates = Gun rights and other American political activists support the private production of ghost guns, claiming the practice as a Constitutional right and a way to maintain the privacy of gun owners. Individuals have organized \\"build parties\\" where equipment and expertise are shared to help create ghost guns. Advocates say that ghost guns are rarely used in crime despite widespread ownership. Gun rights advocates and law enforcement assert that due to the cost and effort required to make ghost guns, criminals prefer to steal the guns used in crimes, a fact borne out by DOJ statistics. Between 2012 and 2017, ATF estimated over 1.8 million firearms were stolen from individual gun owners, vehicles and residences, and another 40,000 were stolen from FFL's, numbers that vastly dwarf those of ghost guns linked to crimes. = Notable Crimes = Ghost guns have been used in at least two spree shootings in California, most notably the shooting spree at Rancho Tehama Reserve in 2017 by a man who was barred from possessing guns.  Relevant legislation  = United States federal law = Congress passed the Gun Control Act of 1968 or the GCA, to expand interstate commerce controls over common firearms like pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles. The GCA requires those who are ‚Äúengaged in the business‚Äù of manufacturing or dealing in firearms to be licensed by ATF. Federal firearms licensees are required to mark their firearms‚Äô serial numbers and keep records of their transactions. The GCA also prohibits certain categories of persons, like convicted felons, domestic abusers, illegal drug users and others, from possessing firearms. To help enforce these prohibitions, Congress passed the Brady Act in 1993, creating the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, and requiring FFLs to submit potential firearms purchaser information to NICS before transferring firearms. While Congress passed the GCA to help law enforcement fight gun crime, it expressly added that the Act was not to place any undue burden on law abiding citizens who use or make firearms for lawful, private purposes. = California= In 2014, California attempted to enact a law to require serial numbers on unfinished receivers and all other firearms, including antique guns, but it was vetoed by the governor. However, in 2016, it passed a measure requiring anyone planning to build a homemade firearm to obtain a serial number from the state (de facto registration) and pass a background check. From July 1, 2024, \\"firearm precursor parts\\" may only be sold through a licensed dealer. = Connecticut = Since October 1, 2019, all manufactured guns must have a serial number obtained from the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection engraved. Plastic, undetectable guns are banned. = New Jersey= S2465, enacted in November 2018, prohibits the manufacture and sale of guns or parts that are or can become an untraceable firearm. Multiple arrests were made within months of this law going into effect. Attorney General Gurbir Grewal aggressively prosecuted infractions of this law. New Jersey filed a lawsuit against U.S. Patriot Armory, a company that allegedly sold AR-15 build kits to NJ residents. In July 2019, S3897 was enacted, which criminalizes transferring or possessing unserialized firearms. = New York = In 2015, during the state of New York's first prosecution for sale of ghost guns, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that it was \\"easy\\" for \\"criminals to make completely untraceable, military-grade firearms.\\" In 2019, New York passed a law to prohibit the making, selling, transporting or possessing 3-D-printed guns or other undetectable firearms. = Pennsylvania = Attorney General Josh Shapiro issued a legal opinion in December 2019 that 80% lower receivers are considered firearms. A legal challenge ensued and in January 2020 Commonwealth Court issued a preliminary injunction blocking AG Shapiro's opinion.  Pending legislation  =United States Congress= On July 1, 2020, Representatives Jamie Raskin (MD-08) and David Cicilline (RI-01) introduced House Resolution 7468,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th- congress/house- bill/7468?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22ghost+guns%22%5D%7D&s;=9&r;=4 aiming to reduce gun violence through banning the manufacture of \\"ghost guns\\"‚Äîfirearms that require no background check, have no serial number, and are essentially impossible to trace.https://raskin.house.gov/media/press-releases/raskin- cicilline-introduce-legislation-stop-home-manufacture-ghost-guns As of September 22, 2020, the most recent action taken on the bill was on July 1, when it was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. = Massachusetts = As of April 2020, there are at least two bills that aim to control the distribution of firearm kits as well as 3D printed weapons in the Commonwealth: Bill H.3843,https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H3843 \\"An Act relative to ghost guns\\", presented by Marjorie C.

The company is based in Jackson, Michigan and operates globally. History Prior to 1920, the bakery in Jackson, Michigan was known as Century Bakery; it was purchased by Grover Lutz and Eugene Worden in 1920, who expanded and renamed it the Dawn Donut Company. It produced a donut mix which proved successful and brought the company customers from across the Midwest. The mix was sold in 100lb bags and 200lb barrels, delivered by rail or horse. Dawn was the first industrial bakery mix company in the United States. Dawn was greatly affected by the Great Depression and later by rationing during World War II, and as a result its operations in the 1930s and 1940s were much smaller than during the 1920s. In 1935, Marlin Jones began working at Dawn as a bookkeeper; over the next two decades, he and his wife Evelyne saved money, and in 1955 Jones borrowed the rest needed to purchase Dawn for approximately $600,000. Under the Jones' ownership, the company expanded during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, Dawn was worth over $1M and the company purchased Baker Perkins's automated donut machine division. The same year, Marlin's son Ron began working for Dawn as an accountant, and siblings Miles and Steven joined in 1967 and 1968 respectively.

Nintendo went through multiple different avenues to celebrate the franchise including video games, toys, clothing and events. History Rumors of an anniversary event began in late March 2020, when Video Games Chronicle first reported on a supposed insider leaking info on upcoming Mario games, including remastered 3D Mario games, under the banner Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary. This was followed by more reports by VentureBeat, Gematsu, and Eurogamer confirming such info. It was then believed that the anniversary celebration was meant to begin in mid-April 2020, due to certain dates found on the official website. Other reports claimed that the anniversary was going to be the major focus of Nintendo's E3 2020 presentation. However, these plans were likely changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which postponed the celebration until early September 2020. Further evidence of the anniversary event was discovered on July 15, when fans uncovered a hidden Twitter account for the 35th anniversary, which used the same e-mail address as other official Nintendo accounts. On September 3, 2020, Nintendo released a variant of their Nintendo Directs titled the \\"Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary Direct\\". In this Direct, many games were revealed that were to be released in the coming months, as well as a recap of previously released Mario branded merchandise from 2020. The Direct ended with a montage of most of the mainline Mario releases since 1985, omitting Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, Super Mario Galaxy 2, New Super Mario Bros. 2, and New Super Mario Bros. U. The celebration will end on March 31, 2021. Games The first Mario game to be released in 2020 was Paper Mario: The Origami King, which released July 17. Information for a Paper Mario game for the Nintendo Switch had been leaked to Eurogamer in late March 2020, including information that this was meant to be revealed as a part of the anniversary at E3 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the announcements were split, and instead the game was announced May 14. In the September Nintendo Direct, it was revealed that Super Mario All-Stars would be coming to the Nintendo Switch Online SNES service, and was released on September 3; this was rumored about a week before the reveal. The next game celebrating the anniversary, Super Mario 3D All-Stars, was released on September 18, 2020. It is a compilation title featuring Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy, all of which have been remastered with HD graphics, aspect ratios and updated controls. Super Mario 3D All-Stars was first rumored in March 2020. Also announced was Super Mario Bros. 35, a battle royale based on the 1985 original, which is an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch Online service. The gameplay involves 35 Marios competing in Super Mario Bros. levels, until the last Mario wins, and was released on October 1, 2020. The September Direct also revealed Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, developed by Velan Studios, that was released on October 16. The concept of the game involves a real life toy depicting Mario or Luigi in a kart, where the player can draw a map using the kart and four gates. The player can then race with in-game opponents being the Koopalings using augmented reality. The game comes in two versions, either a Mario version or a Luigi version, both of which come with a charging cable, arrow signs and race gates. Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros., a limited edition compilation Game & Watch handheld that will be released on November 13, 2020. The game is compiled with Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels, and an updated version of the first Game & Watch title Ball, replacing the original character with Mario. It was also said to contain 35 hidden easter eggs, in reference to the anniversary. The handheld itself is based on a modified Widescreen Game & Watch handheld with a d-pad and a full-color LCD screen. Super Mario 3D All-Stars, Super Mario Bros. 35, and Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros. will all be available for a limited time until March 31, 2021. Finally, a port of the Wii U game Super Mario 3D World, titled Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, will be released on February 12, 2021. The game includes increased gameplay speed, online co-op, amiibo support, and the addition of the Bowser's Fury game mode, which introduces a new level and story. Merchandise =Lego= In March 2020, it was revealed Nintendo joined force with the Lego Group to bring a new Lego theme to celebrate the anniversary, titled Lego Super Mario. This theme is a combination of a video game and a Lego set, with an electronic Mario figurine that can interact with barcodes on structures resembling Mario features like Warp Pipes and ? Blocks, which can make sound effects, in linear Super Mario style levels. In total, the Lego theme has 11 sets, 4 packs pertaining to cosmetic changes to the Mario figurine, and a blind bag collection of 10 Mario enemies. It was released on August 1, 2020. More Lego information was revealed in July 2020, when Nintendo unveiled a miniature Lego Nintendo Entertainment System and CRT TV replica, which displayed Super Mario Bros.

During the Direct, Nintendo announced two more clothing brands that were collaborating, Black Milk, which make clothing for women, launched October 6, 2020, and Puma, which released basketball shoes branded with Super Mario 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy iconography. =Toys= Hasbro began collaborating with Nintendo, with their plans being revealed in July 2020 and released the following month. These plans turned out to be Mario themed Jenga and Monopoly tabletop games, complete with unique Mario styled gimmicks. Another company involved in the collaboration was Jakks Pacific, which sold multiple Mario characters figurines throughout the year, both new and old. One of the figurines was a 12-inch tall figurine of Mario, fitted with sound effects and music.

Various retailers offered pre-order bonuses for Super Mario 3D All- Stars. Black Screen Records will be releasing a Super Mario 64 vinyl record album titled \\"Hang on to Your Hats\\" for the Video Game Jazz Orchestra band. Events and partnerships =Real world= Originally, Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan was going to become open to the public in early 2020, in conjunction with the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and to celebrate the anniversary. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan both events were postponed to 2021. Construction on the Universal Hollywood version of the park began in August 2020. Nintendo reopened their New York store, after lockdown and vandalism, and released more Super Mario merchandise. On the day of the anniversary, September 13, Nintendo launched two websites for Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels in Japan. These were meant to pay tribute to these games, and allow for people to look at an overview of the games, as well as download the original instruction manuals. In Japan, Nintendo commissioned special Mario animations for JR East trains. These animations are for weekly random trivia questions, which rotate out each Monday. On September 30, Cold Stone Creamery announced a partnership with Nintendo, which runs until December 15, 2020. The partnership involves three different items for purchase and consumption; a Rainbow Road inspired ice cream filled cake, with the addition of the ice cream served in a Super Mario Odyssey themed cup and a rainbow star milkshake. =In games= Many other Nintendo games will feature in-game events related to the anniversary.

Chaudoir's deceptive communications to the Abwehr are credited with preventing the 11th Panzer Division from reinforcing German forces at Normandy. Early life Elvira de la Fuente was born in . Her father was a Peruvian guano exporter and diplomat. She was raised in Paris, attended a private school, and spoke fluent French, English, and Spanish. When she was 23, she married Jean Chaudoir. Unhappy in her marriage, she moved to Cannes with her girlfriend Romy Gilbey in 1938, where she socialized and gambled. When the Germans invaded France in 1939, Chaudoir and Gilbey fled to England. Espionage Bored in England, Chaudoir spent much of her time gambling, losing, and complaining that because she was Peruvian, she could not find interesting work. An RAF officer overheard her complaints and her name was passed around until it reached Lieutenant Colonel Claude Edward Marjoribanks Dansey, assistant chief of MI6 who made contact with Chaudoir using the pseudonym \\"Mr. Masefield\\". After mentioning his awareness of her financial difficulties, Dansey convinced Chaudoir to work for MI6, pointing out that as her father was currently the Peruvian charg√© d'affaires to the Vichy government and she had a Peruvian passport, she could travel to France under the pretext of visiting him. Dansey suggested that she let herself be recruited by the Germans so she could provided false intelligence to the Germans on behalf of MI6. Chaudoir was taught how to use invisible ink to send reports hidden within innocuous letters. Her first code name was \\"Cyril\\". Chaudoir's case officers were Christopher Harmer and Hugh Astor. Chaudoir returned to France. In spring of 1941, Chaudoir was approached by Henri Chauvel, an unscrupulous French collaborator. Through Chauvel, Chaudoir became acquainted with Helmut Bleil, a German spy who went by the nickname of \\"Bibi\\". After several dates, Bleil suggested that Chaudoir might make money by providing political, financial, and industrial information about Britain to his unnamed \\"friends\\". Chaudoir's father had served in England as a Peruvian diplomat before being assigned to Vichy France. The Abwehr were interested in Chaudoir because of the perception that she had access to influential diplomatic circles. Bleil gave Chaudoir the code name of \\"Dorette\\" and arranged for her to receive ¬£100 a month disguised as alimony payments. Bleil provided Chaudoir with a bottle of invisible ink which she was to use in letters to Chauvel who would pass them on to Bleil. Chaudoir returned to England and reported to MI6, who debriefed her and handed her to MI5 to be put to use as a double agent. MI5's investigation into her background registered concern about her \\"lesbian tendencies\\" and they were unable to confirm Bleil's relationship with the German government. Chaudoir had a reputation as a frivolous, spendthrift socialite with \\"a colourful sex life\\". The MI5 investigation concluded, \\"She is merely a member of the international smart gambling set.\\" Despite objections by John Cecil Masterman, Chaudoir was added to the Double-Cross System team on October 28, 1942, with a new code name, \\"Bronx\\", after the cocktail. She was given a cover job at the BBC. MI5 tapped Chaudoir's phone, both to monitor her for pro-German sentiments and to keep an eye on her financial situation. Under direction of her Double Cross handler, Chaudoir planted half-truths, propaganda, and invented quotes from real people in her letters to Chauvel. One of her letters claimed that the British had made excellent preparations to defend against gas warfare as well as stockpiling large amounts of chemical weapons for retaliation, which Masterman believed helped dissuade the Germans from using poison gas against England. German communications to Chaudoir indicated that they trusted her reliability as their agent, and her handler in MI5 described Chaudoir as \\"probably one of our most reliable agents.\\" As part of Operation Cockade, Chaudoir told the Germans that the invasion of France was planned for September while other Double Cross agents were sending similar misinformation to their contacts in corroboration. However, the Germans failed to react. As the Germans became more anxious for immediate information about any invasion plans, Bleil instructed Chaudoir to send a message to a Lisbon bank indicating when and where the attack would occur. The message could not make use of the invisible ink, so locations were mapped to specific amounts of money. Chaudoir was to send a telegram requesting a specific amount from the bank, which would indicate the location of the invasion, and use one of several planned phrases to indicate the timing. Planning the invasion, the Allies were concerned about the German forces on the west coast of France, fearing they would mobilize to reinforce the Germans at Normandy. In support of Operation Overlord, Chaudoir was instructed to send a telegram on May 27, 1944: \\"Envoyez vite cinquante livres. J'ai besoin pour mon dentiste\\" (English: \\"Send fifty pounds quickly. I need it for my dentist.\\"). The bank director immediately passed it on to German intelligence. In Berlin, the message was decoded to mean \\"I have definite news that a landing is to be made in the Bay of Biscay in one week.\\" An entire tank division was waiting at the Bay of Biscay when the Allies landed at Normandy. Masterman credited Chaudoir's telegram for the 11th Panzer Division remaining in the southwest of France to defend against an attack that never came. When the D-Day invasion took place, Chaudoir sent mail to Bleil explaining why her warning had been incorrect, blaming it on her informant. After the initial landing at Normany, Chaudoir and other Double Cross agents passed information to their German contacts that Normandy was just a diversion. Chaudoir's letter said, \\"Only part of Allied force in Normandy operations, bulk remains here at present\\" and hinted at a second invasion. Toward the end of the war, Chaudoir travelled to Madrid to meet with German intelligence, but was unable to locate a single German spy. After she wrote them a scathing letter, they asked her to use the telegram to the bank method again to let them know if an invasion was planned for Scandinavia or northern Germany. Later life When peace was declared, Chaudoir retired to Beaulieu- sur-Mer where she ran a gift shop called l'Heure Bleu. Chaudoir resided in the south of France after the war until her death. MI5 sent her a check for ¬£5,000 in December 1995 in recognition of her war-time service. She died in January 1996, age 85. The MI5 files on Elvira Chaudoir were made public on September 5, 2005.

The movement was created in response to the British Townshend Acts of 1767 and 1768, in the early stages of the American Revolution.  Background  In the 17th century, the Kingdom of England was vested in protecting its textile manufacturing, one of its largest industries. The British discouraged their colonies in America from producing wool, expecting Americans to import textile from England and in return serve as its suppliers of raw materials. When the colonies began skirting this arrangement, the Wool Act of 1699 was passed barring them from exporting wool, wool yarn, and wool cloth. This spurred a movement to instead use flax and hemp to make home spun textiles, including linen, rather than purchase from the English.  Homespun and the American Revolution  Homespun became a term used to describe all American-made cotton, linen, and wool textile. With the popularity of the boycott of British goods, wearing homespun clothing became a patriotic symbol of the fight against British rule. Women in particular took a leading role in the movement by avoiding imported satin and silk, instead using locally made materials to spin cloths. They made spinning into a social event.

It was not affiliated with the Pok√©mon media franchise. It was removed from the platform in April 2018 by Roblox administrators, reportedly after copyright concerns were raised by Nintendo. At its height, the game was regularly reaching tens of thousands of concurrent users. Pokemon Brick Bronze was one of many Pokemon games on Roblox, though it was widely considered the most extensive. The game's graphics were mostly a 3D block-style consistent with most games on Roblox, though the Pok√©mon were each represented by 3DS models in a pixel art style. Story The game begins with the player waking up in their house. After choosing their starting Pok√©mon, it transpires that the player's parents have discovered a \\"dark secret\\" about the world, and that they have been kidnapped by enemies. Gameplay Pok√©mon Brick Bronze played much like a traditional Pok√©mon handheld game. At the beginning, players chose from 18 Pok√©mon from numerous games. Brick Bronze featured combat similar to actual Pok√©mon games, with a turned-based battle system and NPC opponents that consisted of trainers and other traditional Pok√©mon enemies. Reception Luke Binns of Softonic gave a positive review of the game, praising its expansiveness and declaring that \\"When playing Pok√©mon Brick Bronze, you may think you‚Äôre playing the real thing\\". David Jagnuex, writing in PCMag, also spoke positively of the game, stating that it had \\"enough original ideas to occupy several days of your time\\". Steven Asarch, writing in Player-One, gave a negative review of the game, criticising what he considered the \\"poor implementation of the battle system\\". Legacy Following the deletion of Pokemon Brick Bronze, the Llama Train Studio development team went on to work on a sequel to Pokemon Brick Bronze called Loomian Legacy. Loomian Legacy was released on July 20, 2020.

Sufferers are often referred to as \\"long-haulers\\". \\"Long Covid\\" is a patient-made term which was first used in May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego. As time passes from the first reports of the disease in December 2019, it has become clear that COVID-19 has become a long-term illness for some people, with initial infection marking the start of ongoing and debilitating symptoms. Some early studies suggest that between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority (up to 80%) of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease experience long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath (dyspnoea), and symptoms may also persist in mild, non-hospitalised cases. While patients with a severe form of the acute disease may also suffer from post-intensive care syndrome following recovery, those who suffered a milder or moderate form can sometimes suffer from longer-term effects. An early analysis by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health Research suggests that ongoing Long Covid symptoms may be due to four syndromes: permanent damage to the lungs and heart, post-intensive care syndrome, post- viral fatigue syndrome, and continuing COVID-19 symptoms. Symptoms Symptoms include severe fatigue, muscle weakness and aches, memory loss, diarrhoea, skin rashes, breathlessness, difficulty concentrating (\\"brain fog\\"), mood swings, low grade fever, loss of taste and smell, sore throat, joint pain, hair loss and sometimes accompanied by depression and other mental health problems. On 1 September 2020 The Lancet Infectious Diseases published an article by 15 doctors summarising the most common complaints of people recovering from COVID-19, who had experienced different degrees of severity during the acute phase, seen in their clinical practice. They reported an observational study of 100 recovering/recovered patients published in July 2020, which found that 78 of these patients had abnormal findings on cardiovascular MRI (median 71 days after diagnosis), and 36 of those experienced dyspnoea and unusual fatigue. While long-term sequelae of the disease were as yet unknown, the authors said that research into aspects of these long-term effects is needed, including prediction of which patients may suffer such effects, management of the acute phase which may help to avert the symptoms, phases of the immunological response in these patients, possible genetic determinants, and treatments for the symptoms. A number of studies are currently looking at the long-term effects of the virus on some individuals. A wide range of longer-term damage to other organs has been found, including nervous system, and possibly kidneys, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms such as decreased lung and cardiac function and decreased exercise capacity have frequently been recorded. In addition, a range of symptoms of as yet unknown aetiology, such as fatigue, joint pain, \\"brain fog\\", and fever, have led to comparisons with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), although distinct from such a diagnosis, which is dependent on other criteria. Doctors are hoping to find specific causes for the symptoms experienced by COVID-19 \\"long-haulers\\", who are often young, previously fit and healthy people, as their treatment will differ depending on the aetiology, which could be lingering infection, autoimmune abnormalities, lung or heart damage, inflammation or other reasons. Studies In April/May 2020, 143 patients who had been hospitalised in acute care were followed up in Rome, Italy. 87.4% reported at least one persisting symptom, particularly fatigue and dyspnoea. A study by King's College London found that an estimated 10 per cent of COVID-19 sufferers in the UK did not recover within three weeks, and about 250,000 people experienced symptoms for 30 days or more. The University of Leicester and the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust are undertaking a major study into the long-term health effects of COVID-19 . Health system responses =Australia= In October 2020, a guide published by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) says that ongoing post-COVID-19 infection symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain will require management by GPs, in addition to the more severe conditions already documented. =United Kingdom= In Britain, the National Health Service has begun to set up specialist clinics for the treatment of Long Covid. The four Chief Medical Officers of the UK were warned of academic concern over Long Covid on 21 September 2020 in a letter published in The BMJ and written by Trisha Greenhalgh. The letter was signed by academics including David Hunter, Martin McKee, Susan Michie, Melinda Mills, Christina Pagel, Stephen Reicher, Gabriel Scally, Devi Sridhar, Charles Tannock, Yee Whye Teh, and Harry Burns, former CMO for Scotland. In October 2020, NHS England's head Simon Stevens announced the NHS had committed ¬£10 million to be spent that year on setting up Long Covid clinics to assess patients' physical, cognitive, and psychological conditions and to provide specialist treatment. Future clinical guidelines were announced, with further research on 10,000 patients planned and a designated task-force to be set up, along with an online rehabilitation service‚Äì \\"Your Covid Recovery\\".

It was completed in 2020, replacing the Montgomery Art Gallery, which had been home to the Pomona College Museum of Art (PCMA) since 1958. It houses a collection of approximately 15,000 works, including Italian Renaissance panel paintings, indigenous American art and artifacts, and American and European prints, drawings, and photographs. The museum is free to the public. History Pomona College established a separate School of Art and Design in 1892, and incorporated it into the college . In 1958, responding to increased postwar interest in the arts, the Gladys K. Montgomery Art Center was completed adjacent to the art department in Rembrandt Hall, enabling the college to present its permanent collection in one place for the first time. The gallery experienced a brief golden age from 1969 to 1973, during which director Mowry Baden (class of 1958) and curators Hal Glicksman and Helene Winer staged a number of groundbreaking post-minimalist and conceptual exhibitions, including work by James Turrell (class of 1965), Judy Fiskin (class of 1966), Chris Burden (class of 1969), and Peter Shelton (class of 1973), all of whom would later achieve fame. Resistance from the more socially conservative administration, including to a controversial March 1972 performance by Wolfgang Stoerchle in which he urinated on a rug, led to a mass exodus of the art faculty in 1973. Art historian Thomas E. Crow later wrote that the works created and presented at the college during this period were arguably \\"as salient to art history as any being made and shown anywhere else in the world at that time.\\" In 1977, a new gallery was added, doubling the available exhibition space. A more minor renovation was completed in 2006, adding a new entrance. In 2020, the museum moved to a new building, the Benton, constructed diagonally adjacent to the old Montgomery Gallery. The new $44 million facility, named after donor and trustee Janet Inskeep Benton (class of 1979), more than tripled the exhibition and storage space available to the museum. It overcame local opposition from Claremont residents who objected to the moving of a historic house to create space on the lot. Collections Prometheus (1930) by Jos√© Clemente Orozco The Benton houses a collection of approximately 15,000 works, including Italian Renaissance panel paintings, approximately 6,000 Pre-Columbian to 20th-century indigenous American art and artifacts, and American and European prints, drawings, and photographs. Many of the museum's exhibitions focus on Southern Californian artists. Former director Kathleen Howe described its primary focus as \\"contemporary art with an edge\\". The museum oversees several notable public artworks on Pomona's campus, including The Spirit of Spanish Music by Burt William Johnson (1915), Prometheus by Jos√© Clemente Orozco (1930), Genesis by Rico Lebrun (1960), and Dividing the Light by James Turrell (2007).

Chancy was a co- founder of the Centre d‚Äô√âtudes Secondaires and of a major teacher's union in Haiti. He participated in the leftist resistance to the Duvalier dictatorship and was exiled to Canada in the 1960s, where he continued his political and educational work, before returning to Haiti after the dictatorship's fall.  Early life  Max Chancy was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in 1928. He studied at the l'√âcole normale sup√©rieure at the Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti, and he also obtained a philosophy degree from the Sorbonne in France and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Mainz in Germany.  Career  After completing his university studies in Europe, Chancy returned to Haiti and taught at the Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti as well as Toussaint Louverture High School. In 1954, he co-founded the Centre d‚Äô√âtudes Secondaires, a distinguished school in Port-au-Prince. In parallel to his educational activities, Chancy was also engaged in syndicalism, and he was one of the founding members of Haiti's national secondary school teachers' union, UNMES. He also fought against the dictatorship of Fran√ßois Duvalier, joining the Marxist-Leninist People's Party of National Liberation and subsequently the Unified Party of Haitian Communists. He was arrested and tortured by the authorities in 1963. After being released, he was exiled to Canada alongside his family, settling as political refugees in Outremont, Montreal, in 1965. In Canada, Chancy continued his work as an educator, teaching philosophy at C√©gep √âdouard-Montpetit from 1970 until 1985 and lecturing at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al from 1973 until 1977. In 1980, he became a member of Quebec's Council of Education, where he oversaw various committees, notably one on \\"Quebecois Schools and Cultural Communities.\\" His work on this committee led to the \\"Chancy Report,\\" which introduced the concept of intercultural education for the first time in the province. He also continued his trade unionist work, including through the 1974 International Conference of Worker Solidarity, alongside Michel Chartrand. Chancy continued to engage with Haiti's educational system from afar. Along with his wife, fellow educator and activist Adeline Magloire Chancy, he helped found the Maison d'Ha√Øti, an organization dedicated to education, in Montreal in 1972. After Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted in 1986, Chancy returned to Haiti. He died in P√©tion-Ville in 2002, after a long illness.

The decision was appealed to the NSW Supreme Court in November 1996 and the court upheld the tribunal ruling and dismissed the appeal. The dispute occurred when Andrew Hope and William (Bill) Brown, who had been living together and had significant assets together, tried to secure family health care cover for their son. NIB refused to provide family health cover. Andrew and William brought the matter to the NSW Equal Opportunity Tribunal on the grounds they were discriminated against under the Anti- Discrimination Act 1977 NSW.

Biography =Early career= Jasin was born in Surabaya on 26 June 1915 and received Islamic education in madrasa and pesantren. He was the son of a well-known ulama in Surabaya. After completing his education, he taught at a madrasa in Sampang before returning to Surabaya, where he taught at a madrasa affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama. From 1939 until the Japanese takeover in 1942, he was a merchant in the city, and between 1938 and 1942 he was a member of the political organization. Jasin was arrested and apparently sentenced to death during the Japanese occupation by the Japanese forces, but the surrender of Japan and the ensuing independence of Indonesia occurred before he could be executed. =Old Order= During the Indonesian National Revolution, he was for a time chief of political education in the Indonesian Navy and managed a cigarette factory. After the handover of sovereignty, Jasin became a city councillor in Surabaya and continued to work as a merchant. Within Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), he participated in the Ansor Youth Movement and the NU Farmers' Association. He took part in the 1955 legislative election and was elected to the People's Representative Council, but he became an inactive member when he was appointed minister, and less than a month after the swearing in he was replaced by another NU politician. Initially, the Nahdlatul Ulama nominated Zainul Arifin as Minister of Social Affairs in the newly formed Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet. However, protestations from Masyumi resulted in Jasin being appointed instead. During the Guided Democracy period, Jasin served as a Minister for Liaison with Ulama, a position he would hold from the establishment of the Working Cabinet on 9 July 1959 to the initial reshuffle of the Dwikora Cabinet on 1 October 1965. He was assistant under coordinating or deputy prime ministers after the cabinet's reshuffle, until he no longer held a cabinet seat after the Ampera Cabinet was established.; =Death= Jasin died in his home in Surabaya on 3 May 1980 and was buried in a public cemetery of the city on 4 May with a military funeral. At the time of his death, he had two wives and six children.

He was two-time President of the National Press Club of the Philippines before going underground in 1972 at the start of the Marcos dictatorship. During this time, he edited and wrote for publications produced by the Communist Party of the Philippines, eventually becoming the Editor-in-Chief of its official news organ, Ang Bayan. In 1990, he was elected Chairperson of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines in absentia, and was a senior adviser to the NDFP negotiating panel from 1994 until his death in 2001. Early life Zumel was born in Laoag, Ilocos Norte to Antonio Zumel, Sr., a lawyer with his own practice, and Basilisa de Leon, former school teacher, the second of five children. Family members called him by his nickname \\"Ching\\". Their family owned the only car in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte. He described his father as having a \\"relatively good law practice,\\" which allowed him to send his children to a private school, the Holy Ghost Academy, for elementary education. His parents taught him the virtues of \\"honesty and integrity,\\" and were against extravagance of any kind. As a child, Zumel and his brother Jose Maria Carlos would skip out on violin lessons and would be hit by his father's belt as punishment. Zumel's father died in 1945 when he was 13 years old. His father's death left a toll on the family, and his mother struggled to raise him and his siblings. Basilisa de Leon had to sell her jewelry, and eventually, parcels of land that the family had bought over the years. His sister, who was studying at St. Scholastica's College at the time, had to find work as a clerk to support her studies. His younger sister, Rosario Angeles, was sent to live with relatives in Baguio City, who cherished her as their own. The family struggled to make ends meet. In 1947, Zumel moved to Manila to study high-school in the Far Eastern University, while living with \\"a spinster aunt\\" who ran a boarding house. To support his studies, he took up odd-jobs to make an income, including as a casual laborer working at a dump for war surplus, and as an assistant in his uncle's water taxi service. Zumel described his experience working in the pier as hard, having to work 24 hour shifts before resting the next day. At one point, Zumel worked at a construction job where he performed physical labor such as running errands, mixing cement, and assisting carpenters and masons. He was not paid for this job, leaving an impression on him that will last his entire life. Journalism career In 1949, his aunt's boarding house business wasn't doing well. Zumel thought of dropping out of school when his uncle, Salvador Pe√±a, got him a job as a copyboy at the Philippines Herald. This gave him the opportunity to continue on to college, working the day shift at the Herald while attending night classes at the Lyceum of the Philippines University. Zumel was barely 17 at the time and lied about his age to be able to work. During this time, Zumel observed the editors, copy readers, and reporters working at the Herald while continuing to perform menial tasks and reading up on journalism books that he bought. Miguel Almario, a journalist who knew Zumel during this time, described him as \\"a very willing worker, cheerful, never complaining, very eager to know the profession.\\" During this time, one of the journalists, Teddy Benigno, was forming a union and invited Zumel to be a part of, which he early agreed to. He had to his involved from Pe√±a, who was personnel manager at the time. After two years, Zumel was promoted from copyboy to proofreader. He dropped out of college, believing it unnecessary since he already had a good job. He worked in the Mechanical Department of the Herald and became close with the workers there. Two years later, in 1953, Zumel became a reporter and covered mostly crime and political stories. His coverage of police, labor, and other political stories would inform his political views. Manuel Almario said of him that he \\"sympathized with the workers\\" as he covered stories for the Congress of Labor Organizations. From 1955, Zumel and his associates were active in the National Press Club, becoming \\"fixtures at the bar or restaurant.\\" =Union organizing= By the 1960s, the Herald union led by Teddy Benigno had become inactive. Benigno had left the paper and those who remained had little interest in organizing work. Zumel took it up to himself to try and re-organize the union, alongside a \\"small core of close friends\\" from the Mabuhay and El Debate, two other publications also owned by Vicente Madrigal alongside Herald. Management caught wind of the idea and talked to Zumel, talking him out of pursuing a collective bargaining agreement for salary increases. In 1962, the Herald was sold to the Soriano family, who owned San Miguel Corporation. Zumel's union registered with the Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions, headed by Cipriano Cid at the time. Zumel was vice-president of the union. In response, the new Herald management created a company union and affiliated it with the Philippine Transport and General Workers' Organization, headed by Roberto S. Oca. Tensions rose, giving way to a CBA deadlock in September 1962, which led to a strike. The strike lasted three months and was unsuccessful, and ended with union members returning to work. Zumel took an active role in leading the strike, and one point, laying down on the road with fellow journalist Rey Veloso to block delivery vehicles from going out. Herald management, on the other hand, hired \\"armed goons from Bulacan and criminal elements from the urban poor community in Intramuros to create trouble at the picket line.\\" In one incident, Zumel challenged a Captain Abad of the Soriano-owned security forces to a gunfight, which Abad refused. =Manila Bulletin and National Press Club President= After the strike, Zumel worked in the Herald for two and a half more years, for a total of 16 years. In 1965, he accepted an invitation from Ben Rodriguez, editor-in-chief of the Manila Bulletin. He would work in the Bulletin until the declaration of Martial law in the Philippines. In the 1960s, Zumel also had an active role in the National Press Club. He managed to serve in its board of directors at least 12 times, before deciding to run as President in 1969. As President, he became involved with the national democratic movement, then at its infancy. He campaigned for the release of arrested staffers of Dumaguete Times, a publication in Negros Occidental. Three of these staffers, Hermie Garcia, Mila Astorga, and Vic Clemente, turned out to be members of Kabataang Makabayan and furnished Zumel with political materials from time to time, or sitting down for political discussions. During this time, he also became chairman of the board of directors of the Amado V. Hernandez Foundation. Working with Antonio Tagamolila of the College Editors' Guild of the Philippines, they published the second edition of Jose Maria Sison's work, Struggle for National Democracy. He also became a member of the Communist Party of the Philippines under the National Press Bureau of the Party's General Secretariat, after Carolina Malay of Taliba and Satur Ocampo of Manila Times approached him in his NPC office. Zumel opened the NPC to the growing mass movement, eventually allowing it to become the headquarters of the Movement for a Democratic Philippines. During and after the First Quarter Storm of 1970, NPC offices served as a refuge for mass leaders from police and military assault, and as an open space for press conferences. He also passed a resolution \\"aligning the NPC with our people's movement for fundamental change in our society\\" in the NPC's 1970 national assembly, shortly before he was re- elected for a second term. When President Ferdinand Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus in 1971, Zumel helped form the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties alongside personalities such as Jose W. Diokno and Lorenzo Ta√±ada in protest. Members of the NPC, including then President Amando Doronila of the Daily Mirror were instrumental in rallies alongside MCCCL. Martial law On September 22, 1972, Zumel received a call from Joe de Vera that Minister of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile had been ambushed. Zumel said that \\"the whole thing sounded like a lot of bullshit,\\" and told de Vera to get more details. That same night, he was drinking beer with friends at the National Press Club bar when soldiers locked down mass media offices, including the Bulletin. Marcos had declared Martial Law. Zumel went underground that same night. Once underground, he assumed the nom de guerre of Ka KP and began working with the staff of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines' publication Liberation as early as October 1972, as well as its news agency, Balita ng Malayang Pilipinas. He was also part of the preparatory committee which established the NDFP on April 23, 1973. He also edited other regional newspapers such as Dangadang. As early as July 1976, Zumel was slated to take on the reins of the CPP's official news publication, Ang Bayan and replace Sison as its editor-in-chief. However, complications including the arrest of New People's Army commander-in-chief Bernabe Buscayno on August 1976 hindered the formation of a new editorial staff. Zumel would officially become the editor-in-chief during the last quarter of 1976, expanding the editorial staff and recruiting former journalists like Malay. Zumel implemented multiple changes to Ang Bayan, drawing from his years of journalistic experience. Ang Bayan began publishing biweekly, and staff of regional papers were deputized as Ang Bayan correspondents. News articles also followed a more journalistic style, following rules in news writing. Ang Bayan also began featuring human interest stories and letters to the editor during Zumel's time as editor-in- chief. Post-Marcos dictatorship In the aftermath of the first People Power Revolution on February 1986 and the removal of Marcos from power, Zumel and other former journalists surfaced. He represented the NDFP as part of the first negotiating panel in 1986-7 in talks with the new Corazon Aquino government. Negotiations broke down however and Aquino pursued a total war strategy in dealing with the communists. In 1989, Zumel was assigned in the Netherlands to undertake international relations work on behalf of the NDFP, as well as to seek medical assistance. He brought along his wife, Mela Castillo and their daughter, Malaya, with him to Europe, where he kept a semi- underground profile. However, in 1990, Philippine authorities caught wind of Zumel's activities and, fearing arrest should he return to the country, sought political asylum in the Netherlands. The request was granted by the Dutch government in 1997. Zumel continued to be a member of the CPP's Central Committee and worked with the International Department. In 1990, he was elected in absentia to the position of chairperson of the NDFP, which he served until 1994. In 1994, he was made honorary chairman of the NDFP and senior advisor of the NDFP negotiating panel. He was living in exile during the events of the Second Great Rectification Movement, where he worked tirelessly to explain and clarify the re-affirmist position. He would go to forums organized by rejectionists and \\"counter-revolutionaries\\" to defend the re-affirm position and to \\"reach out to those whom he considered to be open to the correct line but who were temporarily confused or misled by the counter- revolutionaries.\\" Later years and death In 1998, Zumel suffered a severe stroke that caused partial paralysis. He underwent rehabilitation for a few months before he could move again. He was, however, left wheelchair-bound. In 1999, the College Editors' Guild of the Philippines conferred the Marcelo H. del Pilar Award, its highest honor, to him. His health continued to fail in the next years, before he passed away from a heart attack on August 13, 2001. He was survived by his wives, Ruth de Leon Zumel and Mela Castillo, and their three children, Antonio III, Veronica, and Malaya. Personal life Zumel met and married Ruth de Leon in the 1950s. The two of them had a son, Antonio Zumel III, and a daughter, Veronica. As a journalist working for the Herald, he was awarded a house-and-lot unit on Newsmen's Row in Project 8, Quezon City. However, Zumel opted to allow a bedridden colleague live in the house. Although, Zumel recounted in 1986 that he was divorced from de Leon \\"due to a lack of political and personal compatibility, in large part because of [his] own faults and shortcomings.\\" In 1975, while part of the revolutionary underground, Zumel married Mela Castillo. They had a daughter, Malaya. Contemporaries described Zumel as \\"a loyal friend\\" that was \\"easygoing, friendly, and fun-loving, with a fondness for music and a healthy sense of humor.\\" In his days in the Herald, he was closest to Olaf Giron and Abraham Vera. He was known to be a regular at the NPC bar, and was part of the \\"Batang Klub\\", a \\"coterie of NPC old-timers who had built up legends around their persona with their personal exploits and the way they elicited fear, respect, and endearment among their journalist colleagues.\\" He kept his sense of humor as a revolutionary; one of his noms de guerre was KP, short for \\"katawang pangromansa\\" (born for romance), deprecating his lead, thin chest with a modest beer belly. As a journalist, his work was considered to be impeccable. Even as a copyboy, co-workers and elder journalists encouraged him and thought that he would \\"go places\\" in journalism. He found his passion in journalism, which his sister described as \\"his niche in life.\\" While in exile, Zumel and his family lived in a refugee reception center in Breda then to a regular refugee camp in Amersfoort. He \\"gained the friendship and respect of many fellow refugees\\" during this time and was referred to as \\"the Filipini.\\" Zumel was fluent in English and his native Iloko. He forced himself to learn Filipino during his time underground, eventually becoming a fluent speaker and a competent writer in it. Legacy Shortly after his death, the Antonio Zumel Center for Press Freedom was established on August 10, 2004, with the goal of \\"keeping Antonio Zumel's memory, journalistic examples and ethics alive.\\" It also conducts training programs and research into the conditions of journalists and press-related issues. A book of his writings was also released in 2004, entitled Radical Prose: Selected Writings of Antonio Zumel. The anthology includes articles from his time in the Philippines Herald and Manila Daily Bulletin, his writings while in the revolutionary underground, and selected works while in exile in the Netherlands. In 2006, the Antonio Zumel Center for Press Freedom produced and released a documentary film about his life, titled He Never Wrote 30.

He undertook to important missions for the Emirate of C√≥rdoba, the first to the Byzantine Empire in 840 and the second to the Vikings in 845. A native of Ja√©n, he received the nickname al-ghazƒÅl in his youth because he was thin and handsome. He was a Muslim who belonged to the Arab tribe of Bakr ibn WƒÅ æil. The 11th- century historian Ibn ·∏§ayyƒÅn called him \\"the sage of Spain\\" (·∏•akƒ´m al- andalus), and the 13th-century writer Ibn Di·∏•ya devoted more space to his diplomacy than his poetry in his Melodious Compilation from the Poetry of the People of the West. Ibn Di·∏•ya is the only source for the Viking embassy, which he claims to have read about in a now lost work by al-GhazƒÅl's contemporary, TammƒÅm ibn  øAl·∏≥ama. According to Ibn Di·∏•ya, in 844 or 845 the Maj≈´s (his name for the Vikings) launched a raid on Seville and were repulsed by the Emir  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I. Afterwards: > A Maj≈´s ambassador came to make peace with  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn, who sent al- > GhazƒÅl on an embassy to the Maj≈´s king, for al-GhazƒÅl had great presence of > mind, and no door remained closed to him. Al-GhazƒÅl took costly presents > with him on board, and sailed in his own ship along with the Maj≈´s ship. He > arrived at one of their islands, where he rested and repaired his ship. The > Maj≈´s ambassador then sailed first to announce his arrival. They sailed to > where the king resided. It was a great island in the ocean, and in it were > running waters and gardens. It was three days' journey from the continent. > Innumerable Maj≈´s were there, and near were many other isles, small and > great inhabited by Maj≈´s and the continent up there also belongs to them. It > is a large country and it takes several days to pass through it. Maj≈´s were > then heathen, but are now Christians. Ibn Di·∏•ya, however, was considered unreliable in his own day. Moreover, his account contains elements that could only have entered the story in the 11th century or later: al-GhazƒÅl is said to have returned by way of Santiago de Compostela, an insignificant site in 845, and the Vikings converted to Christianity over a century later. Ibn Di·∏•ya quotes extensively from al- GhazƒÅl's poems. One in \\"the Arabic tradition of courtly love\\" describes his flirtation with the queen of the Vikings while her husband looked on. > You have to resist, Oh my heart, a love that troubles thee, and against > which you defend yourself as a lion. You are in love with a Maj≈´siya, who > never lets the sun of beauty set, and who lives at the rarely visited > extremity of the world.

Kupfer- Koberwitz was the author of the Dachau Diaries, in which he describes the events in the concentration camp, the SS Camp and the prisoner society.  Early life  He was born Edgar Kupfer in 1906, the son of an estate manager. He first worked in agriculture and later as an office worker after completing secondary school. He also wrote poetry and newspaper articles on the side. He later took the pen name Kupfer-Koberwitz . After Adolf Hitler's rise to power he fled to Paris in 1934, where he got a job as a hand weaver. From 1937 he worked for a travel company on the Italian island of Ischia. In September 1940 he was expelled from Italy to Innsbruck for disparaging the Nazi regime and Italian fascism . Dachau Diaries On November 11, 1940, Kupfer-Koberwitz was committed to Dachau concentration camp by the Gestapo and from November 1942 was a clerk in a Dachau satellite camp that provided slave labor for the Pr√§zifix Screw Factory , an armaments industry. During this time, at risk to his life, from November 20, 1942 to May 2, 1945 he wrote the manuscript known as the Dachau Diaries, which would ultimately run to 1800 pages. While writing it within the camp, he hid it in various locations and finally buried it in October 1944, wrapped in layers of aluminum, fabric and oil cloth to help preserve it. Kupfer-Koberwitz led American forces to the location of his diaries a week after they had liberated the Dachau camp on April 29, 1945. The diary, although damp, had largely survived. Two years later it would be used as evidence during the Nuremberg Trials. Post-war In the course of the liberation of Dachau he was released at the end of April 1945. After the liberation he lived in the USA until the end of the 1950s, and from 1960 on Sardinia in the village San Teodoro. In 1986 he returned to Germany , first living with friends and finally in an anthroposophical nursing home near Stuttgart. Kupfer-Koberwitz was the author of several books. The Dachau Diaries are now kept at the University of Chicago Library. In addition to publications on the Dachau concentration camp and the island of Ischia, in 1947, as a staunch vegetarian, he wrote Die Tierbr√ºder - a reflection on ethical life, a passionate appeal against indifferent and cruel treatment of animals. He believed that he had \\"suffered so much myself that I can feel other creatures' suffering by virtue of my own\\".Edgar Kupfer-Koberwitz, Animal Brothers: Reflection on an Ethical Way of Life, 4th ed.Mannaheim, Germany: Warland-Verlagsgenossenschaft eG Mannaheim, n. date. Translated by Ruth Mossner for Vegetarian Press, Denver, CO.

It was granted by the College of Arms on 28 June 1905, one month after the university's royal charter was sealed. The coat of arms was registered as a trademark by the University of Sheffield in 1992. In 2005, the university designed a logo consisting of a simplified version of the arms; the logo, however, does not supersede the heraldic symbol. Description and blazon The arms depict a gold-edged open book with the Latin inscription Disce Doce (\\"Learn and Teach\\"), two sheaves of eight silver arrows on either side, the Crown of Success and the White Rose of York. In heraldic terminology, it is blazoned as: > Azure, an open book proper, edged gold, inscribed with the words Disce Doce > between in fess two sheaves of eight arrows interlaced saltireways and > banded argent, in chief an open crown or, and in base a rose also argent > barbed and seeded proper. Below the azure shield is a scroll that carries the Latin motto Rerum Cognoscere Causas (\\"To Discover the Causes of Things\\"), which was also used by Firth College, the predecessor of the University of Sheffield. The motto comes from verse 490 of Book Two of the Georgics by poet Virgil. Heraldic charges The charges on the field of the escutcheon of the University of Sheffield are mainly inanimate objects - arrows, crown and book - as well as a plant - rose. The sheaves of arrows are a wordplay on the River Sheaf which runs through Sheffield, and also are a reference to the iron- and steel-making heritage of the city. Arrows were the main motif in the seals issued to the Burgery of Sheffield and the Twelve Capital Burgesses in 1554 by Queen Mary as a symbol for Sheffield, and they also appear in the coat of arms granted to the Sheffield Borough Council in 1875 and to the City of Sheffield in 1977. The charge in the fess point is an open book with gilded edges inscribed with Disce Doce. The gold open crown above the book is the Crown of Success. Below the book is a white rose with seeds and barbs in their natural colours. It is the White Rose of York, a symbol for Yorkshire, which denotes the home county of the university.

Naval career Jagow was born into a distinguished aristocratic family in Frankfurt an der Oder. Jagow ascribed to the typical Junker values of militarism, nationalism and a deep devotion to serving the state. After attending the M√ºrwik naval school, he joined the Imperial German Navy as an officer on 1 April 1912. During the First World War, he served on a submarine and then commanded a minesweeper after the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Jagow began the war in 1914 as a lieutenant and had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant by 1918. V√∂lkisch activist In September 1919, Jagow joined the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt of the Freikorps and took part in the Kapp Putsch of March 1920. Refusing to take an oath of loyalty to the Weimar Republic, he left the Navy later in March 1920. Settling in Bavaria, he joined the right- wing terrorist group Organization Consul that assassinated pro-Weimar politicians. His first job was as a sales agent for the Bavarian Wood Processing Company, which was a front for the Organization Consul. In the fall of 1920, he joined the NSDAP and in early 1921 he joined the SA. In the spring of 1921, he fought against the Poles in Silesia. Jagow (second on the left) and the Hungarian prime minister Count L√°szl√≥ B√°rdossy (the man on the right) in 1941. In January 1922, Adolf Hitler sent Jagow to set up the first NSDAP group in T√ºbingen, and Jagow subsequently became one of the most important Nazi leaders in W√ºrttemberg. Jagow worked as guest lecturer at Eberhard Karls University. In April 1922 Hitler appointed Jagow SA inspector and chief of staff for W√ºrttemberg. After the failure of the Munich Beer Putsch in November 1923, Jagow left the NSDAP, but remained active in a number of v√∂lkisch groups in W√ºrttemberg. From 1923 to 1927, he was a member of the Bund Wiking (Viking League). In 1927, he joined the Stahlhelm. In 1929, he rejoined the NSDAP. From 1929 to 1930 he was the local NSDAP group leader in Esslingen am Neckar and the managing director of the NSDAP Gau in W√ºrttemberg. In 1931 Jagow was appointed full-time SA group leader \\"Southwest\\", making him in charge of all SA units in southwestern Germany. Jagow was well known as a militant anti- Semite and a devotee of the F√ºhrer principle. Jagow was elected to the Reichstag in 1932 and remained a member until 1945. Under the Nazi Regime In March 1933, Jagow briefly served as the commissioner of the W√ºrttemberg state police. He had a concentration camp built at Heuberg and organised the boycott of Jewish businesses in W√ºrttemberg as part of the national boycott of Jewish businesses on 1 April 1933. The W√ºrttemberg NSDAP was torn by a feud between Gauleiter Wilhelm Murr and his rival Christian Mergenthaler, leading Jagow who backed the losing side to be transferred to Frankfurt am Main as leader of the SA group V. In June 1933, he was promoted to the rank of SA Obergruppenf√ºhrer. After the Night of the Long Knives, Jagow was transferred to Berlin, which he headed the local SA branch from July 1934 to January 1942. Jagow had resumed his naval career in 1933 as a reserve officer and served during the Spanish Civil War in 1936-1937 as an intelligence officer. In 1936, when the v√∂lkisch magazine Das innere Reich was banned following an article which implicitly criticized the idolisation of Frederick the Great under the Third Reich, the editors of the Das innere Reich appealed to Jagow among other people for help. On 23 October 1936, the ban of Das innere Reich was lifted following the intervention of Rudolf Hess. In September 1939, he resumed his naval officer as an active officer, initially commanding the minesweeper Tannenberg in the Baltic Sea. Jagow was always proud to be a Junker and combined traditional Junker values with Nazism. In a letter to his son written in September 1939, Jagow encouraged him to remember the Jagow family values of \\"tradition of honour, loyalty, knightliness and bravery\\". In the same letter, Jagow told his son not to be a Duckm√§user (\\"moral coward\\") and to stay faithful to the \\"National Socialist idea unto death\\". From October 1940 to April 1941, he commanded the 18th flotilla of patrol boats, torpedo boats, and minesweepers in the English channel, leading his forces into nightly clashes with the Royal Navy for control of the channel. Jagow with Hans Heinrich Lammers, May 1939 In January 1941, long-standing rivalries between the Ausw√§rtiges Amt (Foreign Office) and the SS exploded with the attempted coup d'etat in Bucharest that saw SS back the coup by the Iron Guard under its leader Horia Sima against the Prime Minister, General Ion Antonescu while the Ausw√§rtiges Amt together with the Wehrmacht backed Antonescu. In the aftermath of the coup, the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop made an effort to club the power of the SS to conduct a foreign policy independent of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt. Taking an advantage of the long-standing rivalries between the SS and the SA, in 1941, Ribbentrop appointed an assemblage of SA men to head the German embassies in Eastern Europe, with Manfred von Killinger going to Romania, Siegfried Kasche to Croatia, Adolf-Heinz Beckerle to Bulgaria, Dietrich von Jagow to Hungary, and Hanns Ludin to Slovakia in order to ensure that there would be minimal co-operation with the SS. The role of the SA ambassadors was that of \\"quasi-Reich governors\\" as they aggressively supervised the internal affairs of the nations they were stationed in, making them very much unlike traditional ambassadors. The German historian Daniel Siemans wrote that it was significant that four of the five SA ambassadors had served as policemen in their careers, suggesting it was their ability to impose their will on others as police chiefs that led them for them being appointed as ambassadors. Those who knew him reported that Jagow was \\"deeply unhappy\\" about serving as a diplomat as he much preferred to be fighting in the war. From 1941 to 1944, he was the German minister (ambassador) to Hungary. The Hungarian politician Count Mikl√≥s K√°llay described him: \\"In those days I had my first meeting with the German minister , Herr Dietrich von Jagow. He was a relative nonentity, neither a politician nor a career diplomat, but an enthusiastic member of the SA\\". Herbert Pell, the American minister in Budapest called Jagow \\"in many ways a boorish little fellow\\". As minister in Budapest, where he frequently pressured the Hungarian government to do its part in the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" by deporting the entire Hungarian Jewish community to the death camps. He first presented this demand on 17 October 1942 at a meeting with the Hungarian foreign minister Count Jen≈ë Ghyczy and repeated it a number of times there afterwards. However, the Hungarian government increased the severity of its anti-Semitic laws and imposed the onerous labor service on Hungarian Jewish men, but refused to deport its Jews. Jagow knew nothing of Hungary, and his almost mindless militarism as he had a deep-rooted contempt for civilians made it difficult for him to forge friendships in Budapest. Besides for the \\"Jewish Question\\", Jagow's main duties in Budapest were to monitor the situation in Balkans, recruit Hungarian volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) into the Waffen-SS and to ensure that Hungary kept supplying Germany with food. Jagow favored closer links with the Arrow Cross movement, but was generally overruled by his superiors in the Ausw√§rtiges Amt who preferred to stay on good terms with Admiral Miklos Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. In October and again in November 1942, Jagow reported to Berlin that he did not expect the Hungarian government to willing sent its Jews to the death camps. Several times, he repeated the request in 1943, but was always rebuffed which damaged his standing in Berlin. On 15 April 1943, Jagow told Admiral Horthy that he wanted to see two members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ferenc Chrorin and Aur√©l Egry, expelled, saying it was distasteful for him to see two men who had \\"Jewish blood\\" discuss foreign policy questions. Horthy refused under the grounds that this was a Hungarian internal matter. The fact that there were about 762, 000 Jews still living in Hungary at the time of the German occupation in March 1944 was seen as a failure on Jagow's part and he was replaced as ambassador by Edmund Veesenmayer. On 8 May 1944, he returned to Berlin. In September 1944 he became leader of the Volkssturmbataillon 35 of the Volkssturm (militia) in Silesia. Jagow did not enjoy being a diplomat and welcomed the return to the military life, which he craved. On 21 January, 1945 while fighting against the Red Army in Silesia, Jagow personally knocked out 4 Soviet tanks with his panzerfaust (anti-tank rocket launcher), for which he was mentioned in dispatches. During the same action, he was badly wounded and lost an eye. He stayed in a hospital in Leipzig until March 1945 when he was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Italian Social Republic. Along the way to Italy, he stopped in South Tyrol in the city of Meran (modern Merano, Italy), which had been annexed to the Reich in September 1943. On 26 April 1945, Jagow committed suicide in the house of the German ambassador to the Italian Social Republic, Rudolf Rahn. His suicide note stated that he did not want to live in world controlled by Jews. Despite his commitment to Nazism, Jagow was posthumously \\"de-Nazified\\" with a judge in West Germany ruling on 13 February 1950 that Jagow was a \\"lesser offender\\" as the judge ruled he was not a committed Nazi and conducted himself in \\"an idealistic and decent way\\". Jagow's widow was living in dire poverty with seven children to raise, and it appears that the judge's ruling was intended to help her by allowing her to collect a widow's pension rather being based on an objective assessment of his career.

The novel was first published on June 30, 2020 through Dutton. Sager references the 1977 Jay Anson book The Amityville Horror during the novel, which also served as part of Home Before Dark's inspiration. It focuses on the characters of Maggie Holt, via her first person narrative, and her father Ewan, through excerpts taken from a book. The book-within-a-book focuses on supernatural events that Ewan claims drove them to flee their home and never return. Synopsis The novel is told via a split narrative. Maggie Holt narrates events as they happen during current day, while her father Ewan's narrative occurs via passages of his book House of Horrors, which details the family's time at Baneberry Hall during the 1980s. The below synopsis is split into sections, one containing Ewan's narrative and the other containing Maggie's. = House of Horrors = Ewan and his wife Jess have purchased Baneberry Hall, a Victorian home in need of some repair. The realtor reluctantly informs them that the home was the site of a murder suicide; prior owner Curtis Carver murdered his daughter Katie before taking his own life, leaving his wife Martha to discover their bodies. She deliberately omits that the home also has a history of supernatural activity, which the family comes to discover on their own. Ewan and his family experience several strange events that appear to reference both the Carver murder-suicide as well as the house's original owner, William Garson, and his daughter Indigo. His five- year-old daughter Maggie has expressed fear of a being she calls \\"Mister Shadow\\" and has an imaginary playmate called \\"Miss Pennyface\\", so named because she has pennies on her eyes. Ewan begins to investigate the house's history despite a promise from his wife that he leave the past alone and is assisted by the housekeeper's (Elsa) teenage daughter Petra. After the kitchen ceiling collapses Ewan hires a local boy to help the caretaker patch up the ceiling and in the process, discovers letters that detail a love affair between Indigo Garson and a painter. The two planned to run away together and marry, only for Indigo's father to discover the plans. The letters contradict local legend that Indigo had committed suicide. This is later confirmed during a seance where Ewan contacts the spirit of Curtis, who leads them to the discovery that Indigo was murdered and that her spirit has been taking revenge by killing young girls in a way that pushes the blame on their fathers. The Holt family is attacked, but manages to flee the house, never to return. = Maggie Holt = Approximately twenty-five years later, Maggie has grown to despise the book and is hurt at her parents for perpetuating what she sees as lies, as they continue to claim the book's contents as truth, even to Maggie herself. She also believes that whatever truly happened at the house was responsible for her parents' divorce. Ewan sticks to this even on his deathbed, where he also makes Maggie promise to never return to Baneberry Hall since it isn't safe for her to be there. She initially plans on keeping the promise but reneges when she discovers that her father had retained ownership of the house. Maggie revisits Baneberry Hall with the intention to sell it and hires Dane, the son of the prior caretaker, as her assistant. She experiences several strange occurrences happen within the home that mirror events in the book and discovers that her father made yearly visits to the house, contrary to what he told Maggie and the general public. The bones of a teenager, revealed to be Petra, are discovered in the house. Maggie eventually discovers that there is a backdoor in the house leading to her childhood bedroom and that her father had hired Dane to work on the house prior to Petra's death. Believing Dane to be the killer the two fight. In the process Dane is injured and taken to the hospital. Maggie's mother arrives at the house and reveals that Maggie killed Petra, who had been babysitting while Jess and Ewan went on a date. The evidence pointed to Petra having been pushed down the stairs after a struggle with Maggie. In order to protect her Ewan wrote House of Horror, which Jess says was entirely fictional other than Maggie experiencing night terrors. The murderer is eventually revealed to be Martha Carver, who would occasionally sneak into the house to watch Maggie sleep, due to her reminding Martha of Katie. Maggie would wake and see Martha (who she identified as \\"Miss Pennyeyes\\" due to the moonlight shining on her spectacles), prompting the night terrors. When Petra discovers Martha, the woman accidentally kills the teenager during a scuffle. Martha has decided to murder Maggie in order to keep the past hidden and tries to kill her by pushing her down the stairs, only to be pushed down the stairs by Elsa, the former housekeeper. In the aftermath Maggie decides to write a book about the true events of the house. Maggie has since realized that Elsa was \\"Mister Shadow\\", as the superstitious housekeeper had crept into her room during her childhood and whispered warnings, as she believed that the house was unlucky. She also muses that she believes she saw Petra before Elsa pushed Martha, which she hopes was the ghost of Petra herself rather than a hallucination, as she would like to thank her and apologize for everything. Development Sager began planning the novel after listening to a podcast about The Amityville Horror, as the hosts stated that \\"most people agree it was a hoax, but no one knows why the Lutz family did it\\". He felt that this \\"could be an interesting story to explore\\" and chose to use the book-within-a-book structure in order to alternate between the fictional novel House of Horrors and Maggie's own first person narrative. Sager has noted that this made the writing more challenging, as \\"changing something in one meant having to make changes in the other, which would then cause changes in the other.\\" Release Home Before Dark was released in hardback in the United States on June 30, 2020 through Dutton. An audiobook adaptation narrated by Cady McClain and Jon Lindstrom was released by Penguin Audio alongside the hardback. Paperback and Kindle editions will be released in the United Kingdom through Hodder & Stoughton in 2021. Reception Sales for Home Before Dark enabled the book to place on the New York Times Bestseller List for July 19, 2020. The novel was reviewed by USA Today and BookPage, both of which commented favorably on the use of a book- within-a-book structure. Judith Reveal of the New York Journal of Books also noted the structure in her review, stating that \\"Although the multiple first- person points of view (written in different print fonts) can at times be distracting, Sager has laid out an exciting story that is hard to put down.\\" Tina Jordan of the New York Times criticized some of the book's dialogue and supporting characters while also praising the multiple points of view. Adaptation In February 2020 Deadline announced that Sony Pictures won film adaptation rights to Home Before Dark. Shawn Levy‚Äôs 21 Laps Entertainment is to produce the film. In a July 2020 interview with The Big Thrill, Sager stated that the production process had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

She was built in 1975 for J Marr & Son, a Hull-based fishing company. On 11 April 1982 she was taken up from trade by the British government and commissioned into the Royal Navy. She was fitted with Second World War era minesweeping gear at Rosyth Dockyard, manned by Royal Navy sailors and allocated to the 11th Mine Countermeasures Squadron. She sailed on 26 April but was unable to commence sweeping until after the 14 June Argentine surrender. In the meantime she was utilised to transfer troops and stores between ships and landed special forces troops at San Carlos. Demining operations commenced on 21 June. Junella returned to the United Kingdom on 11 August, carrying a defused Argentine mine. Junella was returned to commercial use after the war and in 1983 was sold to the Royal Greenland Trading Department, being renamed Siku. She served with several other companies afterwards under the names Vesttraal and Hill Cove before returning to the name Junella with SA (Fripur), fishing out of Montevideo, Uruguay. After being damaged by fire she was scrapped on 19 July 1999.  Early career  Junella was built for J Marr & Son, a Hull-based fishing company, in 1975. She was built on the Tyne at Wallsend by the Clelands Shipbuilding Company (part of Swan Hunter). She was the first trawler with thermal fluid heating built for the British fleet. She was the last freezer trawler built for the British fleet, until at least 1987. She measured in length and in beam. Her gross register tonnage was 1615 tons and her single diesel engine gave her a top speed of around . On 28 October 1980 she struck rocks off Eilean Trodday, The Minch in Scotland during force 9 winds. Her hull was damaged and she was drydocked at Hull for repairs.  Falklands War  = Requisition and conversion = When the British were planning the military response to the 2 April 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands they suspected that they would need to deal with sea mines laid on the sea approaches. A decision was made on 9 April to take up suitable ships from trade for use as mine countermeasures vessels. The Royal Navy had a number of Ton-class minesweepers, designed for coastal work, but judged these too small to make the trip to the South Atlantic. Three of the newly-built Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessels were in service but had insufficient range to reach the Falklands without being accompanied by a mother ship. RMS St Helena was taken in hand for conversion to this role but would not be ready for the start of the campaign. To fill the gap the navy looked to take up a number of deep sea fishing trawlers for conversion into mine countermeasures vessels. They searched for vessels of between 1,200 and 1,500 tons displacement, capable of approximately 17 knots speed and with a fuel endurance of 60 days. The J Marr & Son vessels Junella, Cordella, Farnella and Northella were chosen along with the British United Trawlers vessel Pict. Junella was taken up from trade on 11 April and proceeded to Rosyth Dockyard for conversion to her new role. Upon arrival some of fish had to be unloaded before works could commence. She was converted between 15 and 24 April, being fitted with Second World War vintage minesweeping equipment, which had been kept in storage by the navy. The mission was given more urgency on 12 April when a British submarine, HMS Spartan, confirmed the presence of moored mines in the Eastern approaches to Port Stanley. The vessel was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Junella and assigned a crew drawn from the 1st Mine Countermeasures Squadron and the Fishery Protection Squadron. Junellas original merchant navy crew requested permission to accompany the vessel to the South Atlantic, either as civilians or by enlistment in the navy but were denied. A small number were retained on board until the vessel reached Freetown, Sierra Leone to train the navy crew. In Royal Navy service Junella was referred to as an Extra Deep Armed Team Sweep (EDATS) trawler and assigned to the 11th Mine Countermeasures Squadron. During the war she was commanded by Royal Navy Lieutenant Mark Rowledge. = Service history = Junella left Rosyth on 26 April, sailing for Portland Harbour in Dorset, where she underwent trials of her minesweeping gear. She departed for the South Atlantic the following day, travelling via Freetown and Ascension Island. The threat of aerial attack was too severe for her to operate inshore in her minesweeping role. In the meantime Junella and the other ships of the 11th Squadron were used to cross-transfer equipment and personnel between vessels of the taskforce. Some of equipment as well as troops were transferred off the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2; a difficult process as the trawlers struggled to stay close enough to the liner without damaging her hull. The equipment was transferred by being passed along chains of soldiers through the corridors of the ship and out her side doors. Junella also transferred members of the 5th Infantry Brigade from Queen Elizabeth 2 to Norland and Canberra in preparation for the landings at San Carlos. The trawler was also used to transfer stores from Saxonia to ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Junella was also used at San Carlos to land and take-off special forces troops of the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service a role for which she was described as ideal. Argentine forces in the Falklands surrendered en-masse on 14 June and the capital, Port Stanley was reoccupied by British forces. Amongst the paperwork discovered was a map of the naval minefields, this, together with the removal of the threat from Argentine aircraft, allowed minesweeping to commence on 21 June. Junella and other ships of the squadron removed 10 of the 21 known mines before being relieved by the Hunt class minesweepers HMS Brecon and HMS Ledbury on 10 July. The trawlers worked to sweep the minefield to cut the moorings after which the mines floated to the surface to be destroyed by rifle fire. British naval command ordered that one of the mines be retained for later study. The last of the mines swept by the trawlers, which had been cut from its moorings by Pict, was recovered by Gemini rigid inflatable boats and towed ashore at Bluff Cove on 26 June. There it was made safe by Royal Navy experts (though the explosive was not removed) and found to be of German origin. The mine was waterproofed and loaded onto Junellas deck for return to the UK. To minimise risk of explosion while passing through the tropics the mine was kept cool under a water-soaked mattress. Other ships were ordered to keep clear of Junella during the return journey. Junella returned to Rosyth on 11 August and the mine was offloaded and transferred to the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at nearby Crombie. The detonator from this mine is retained in the collection of the Imperial War Museum. Junella was afterwards converted back to civilian configuration and returned to service as a fishing vessel. In recognition of her role during the war she was awarded the battle honour \\"Falkland Islands 1982\\".  Post-war career  Junella was sold to the Royal Greenland Trading Department in 1983 and was refitted in Denmark. Afterwards she was renamed Siku and fished for cod. She later served with other companies, being renamed Vesttraal in 1985 and Hill Cove in 1987. She returned to the name Junella after sale to SA (Fripur), a fishing company operating out of Montevideo, Uruguay. Junella suffered major fire and was scrapped at San Antonio Oeste in Argentina on 19 July 1999.

She served as Regent of the Matinecock Chapter (1941‚Äì1944), was State, and later National, Chairman of the Radio Committee, New York Vice Regent (1950‚Äì1953), New York State Regent (1953‚Äì1956), and Recording Secretary General (1956-1959). She ran against Alice B. Haig for the position of President General. =President General Administration= Sullivan's administration was known as the Diamond Jubilee Administration, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the DAR. One of Sullivan's goals was to increase DAR membership from 185,000 to 200,000 by the end of the anniversary. \\"Winkie\\" the owl was the symbol of the administration. The highlight of her administration was her visit to Vietnam in 1968. The executive board for the Sullivan administration was: * First Vice President General: Mrs. Nelson Kilbourn * Chaplain General: Mrs. Fred Osborne * Recording Secretary General: Mrs. Charlotte W. Sayre * Corresponding Secretary General: Mrs. Jackson E. Stewart * Organizing Secretary General: Miss Amanda A. Thomas * Treasurer General: Mrs. Henry Stewart Jones * Registrar General: Mrs. Evelyn Cole Peters (Albert G.) * Historian General: Mrs. Forrest Fay Lange * Librarian General: Mrs. Herbert Dwight Forrest * Curator General: Mrs. Frederick Tracey Morse * Reporter General: Mrs. John James Champieux Although the DAR declares itself to be a non-political organization, they have long spoken out publicly regarding political issues under the guise of Patriotism. This trend continued during the Sullivan administration. Sullivan herself personally advocated on topics such as Vietnam and peace protests, Immigration Quotas, and Disarmament. When asked about black membership in the DAR, Sullivan answered indirectly; she replied that she did not know if the DAR had any black members (the DAR does not record the race of members on applications), but stated that \\"with all the intermarriage in the United States, we undoubtedly have members or women eligible for membership who ancestry includes someone of the Negro race.\\" McCall's Magazine published a feature titled ‚ÄúIf I Were President‚Äù in their January 1968 edition. Sullivan was one of sixteen women who \\"made a distinct and varied contribution to our national life\\" what they would do as the first female President of the United States. Other women interviewed included Margaret Chase Smith, Betty Friedan, Leontyne Price, and Martha Griffiths. Sullivan spoke in favor of officially declaring war in Vietnam War, a strong national defense, and a stronger role of \\"the church\\" in the United States. Sullivan was very much aware of the power of the media and the impact that it could have on the DAR. She was often interviewed and appeared on television shows, such as The David Susskind Show and reported that she preferred live events over recorded ones which were \\"too easy to edit.\\" Highlights of the Sullivan administration: * Celebration of the DAR's Diamond Jubilee, October 10-14, 1965. * Installation of air conditioning and the refurbishment of Constitution Hall * DAR Schools Committee funding and construction of the Adele Erb Sullivan Administration Building at Tamassee DAR School, dedicated in 1967. * Sullivan represented the DAR during a visit to Vietnam in 1968. * Establishment of the Special Committee for DAR Services for Veteran-Patients. * Creation of the Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee Award, given to the outstanding Army Nurse of the Year. =Vietnam= The Sullivan administration coincided with the US Ground War in Vietnam, which greatly impacted the administration's activities. In keeping with its mission of Patriotism, the DAR strongly supported American soldiers fighting in Vietnam while it denigrated those in the \\"so-called peace movement,\\" citing their \\"long hair, beards, and untidy dress.\\" Sullivan warned against an \\"an ideological war planned to capture the minds of men through propaganda,\\" the danger of apathy toward Communism, and the importance of educating children on the \\"correct facts\\" of America. The DAR Magazine featured a multipage section for the National Defense Committee each month, which often focused on the war in Vietnam or Communism. Guest writers included John S. McCain, Jr., who wrote about fighting Communism in February 1966, Charles E. Whittaker, who spoke against mass disobedience in January 1966, and Daniel J. Flood, who warned of Communism in the Panama Canal in January 1967. In the fall of 1967, Sullivan declined to allow folk-singer Joan Baez perform at Constitution Hall, as the singer's pacifist viewpoints, lack of paying taxes, and \\"reported activities\\" were not \\"in line with [their] objectives,\\" and that the DAR was \\"very much behind our boys in Vietnam.\\" Sullivan herself visited Bethesda Naval and Walter Reed Hospitals and encouraged all DAR members, as part of \\"Operation Appreciation,\\" to do the same in their communities. Members could support troops by providing gift cards, cigarettes or baked goods, as well as writing to family members of soldiers. However, in her monthly letter to members in the May 1968 edition of the DAR Magazine, Sullivan reflected that the DAR \\"as a Society, [has] made no tangible contribution to assist our fighting forces\\" in Vietnam. She reported that after consulting with a number of DAR and US government officials, it was decided that \\"a personal visit by the President General of the NSDAR to the combat area would be the greatest contribution our Society could make to the war effort at this time.\\" Reportedly, based in part on the DAR's action against Beaz, the organization gained the attention of General William C. Westmoreland, who thought that a visit from Sullivan to Vietnam would be a \\"worthwhile contribution\\" to the US effort there. Sullivan and other DAR representatives arrived Vietnam on 21 January 1968. While there she visited hospitals and presented 47 Americanism pins to wounded soldiers in recognition of their bravery. Upon returning to the US, she stated that, \\"American boys there believe in the war. They believe in their leaders. They don't know what's the matter with some of the people back home, like those who are burning their draft cards.\\" References Category:Daughters of the American Revolution people ","title":"Adele Woodhouse Erb Sullivan"},{"id":"65257124","text":"Aud Valborg T√∏nnessen (born 1 June 1964) is a Norwegian Lutheran theologian, church historian, professor of theology and the dean of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Oslo.Aud Valborg T√∏nnessen She is an expert on Norwegian church history and Christian international humanitarian work.Aud Valborg T√∏nnessen She was elected as a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 2016.dnva.no DNVA-medlemmer  Selected works  * T√∏nnessen, Aud Valborg: Kirkens N√∏dhjelp: Bistand, tro og politikk, Oslo: Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 2007. * Jensen, Roger, Dag Thorkildsen og Aud Valborg T√∏nnessen (ed.): Kirke, protestantisme og samfunn: Festskrift til professor dr.

Stewed with onions, peas and lettuce, the mutton is served in a dish surrounded by a border of rice. Scholars believe the term China in the name alludes to this oriental ingredient, but the meaning of term chilo remain a mystery. The dish is said to be based on a Chinese dish that 19th-century sailors described upon their return from the China Seas. Food historians speculate whether creative Victorian cooks substituted lettuce for bok choy and peas for bean spouts. Eliza Acton's recipe in Modern Cookery for Private Families was made with leg (or loin) of mutton, shredded young lettuce, peas, and simple seasonings of salt, pepper, butter and green onion. These were stewed with a little water, and if desires, mushrooms, cucumbers, or curry powder. Acton's recipe is served with a separate dish of boiled rice. Mrs. Beeton, however, gives instructions to serve the mutton stew \\"the same as for curry\\", in a dish with a border of rice. China Chilo is a historic recipe of the Victorian era, not found in modern recipe books. In the early 19th-century cookery book A New System of Domestic Cookery by Maria Rundell it is made by simmering undressed neck or mutton (or leg with its fat) with onions, lettuce, clarified butter and water, and served in the center of a dish encircled with boiled rice. A menu from 1932 serves the muttom dish with an appetizer soup made from vegetable consomme simmered with the mutton bones and canned tomatoes, of which the broth was used for the soup and the tomatoes themselves for the vegetable casserole for a complete and economical meal.

Following his arrest, Ocampo was detained at the Orange County Jail, but on November 27, 2013, he ingested a large dose of Ajax, poisoning himself and losing consciousness. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died of acute intoxication the following day, before he could be put on trial.  Biography  Itzcoatl Ocampo was born on March 20, 1988, in Mexico City. He was the eldest in a family of three children. Shortly after his birth, his family emigrated to the United States, settling in Yorba Linda, California. His father, a qualified lawyer, found a high-paying job and rented an apartment. His parents led a law-abiding lifestyle and had no bad habits that affected the family home, thanks to which Itzcoatl grew up in a positive environment without traumatic events. After living in the state for 12 years, Itzcoatl and the rest of his family went through all the legal procedures and obtained American citizenship. Ocampo attended Esperanza High School in Anaheim, graduating in 2006. During his school years, he was known as a friendly and approachable guy, thanks to which he befriended many and was popular among his peers. The September 11 attacks had a strong effect on the formation of his personality, as a result of which in subsequent years he became interested in politics, supporting the Republican Party and George W. Bush's foreign policies. After leaving school, Ocampo, along with his school friend Claudio Pattino, enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to the Marine Corps. Since July 2006, he served at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, after which he was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, where he was attached to the 15th Regiment of the Medical and Sanitary Battalion. In 2008, he was sent to Iraq, but did not partake in combat: his main responsibility was to provide medical support to personnel of various formations, as well as to search for, identify, transport and bury the dead American soldiers, allied military personnel and civilians, coming across much carnage during his stay. He spent eight months in the country, for which he was subsequently awarded the Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. After returning to the USA, he was sent back to Camp Pendleton. During this period, as a result of the Great Recession, his father lost his job. Due to material difficulties, the family lost their homes, and Itzcoatl's father developed a drug addiction, causing his mother to divorce him, taking Ocampo and two of his siblings to stay with some relatives. In July 2010, Itzcoatl retired from the Army and returned to Yorba Linda. Not long after returning from Iraq, he began to show signs of PTSD and exhibited deviant behavior. A serious factor for the deterioration of his mental state was the death of his close friend Pattino, who died on June 22, 2010, while fighting in Afghanistan's Helmand Province. Following his death, Ocampo became depressed, suffered from frequent headaches, hand tremors and alcohol abuse. Over the next two years, unable to adapt to a normal life and hold a job, he depended on income from relatives and refused treatment from psychiatrists. By the end of 2011, his mental state had deteriorated sharply, to the point of developing hypochondria and showing signs of clinical delirium.  Murders  On October 25, 2011, Itzcoatl came to the doorstep of his former classmate, 24-year-old Eden Herrera, where his mother, 53-year-old Raquel Estrada, and his older brother, 34-year-old Juan, were at the time. During the visit, Ocampo unexpectedly lunged at them, stabbing both Raquel and Juan repeatedly, 30 and 60 times, respectively. The neighbors witnessed the murders, providing police with a description of the offender's appearance and his clothing. Because Eden and Itzcoatl were similar in appearance, Herrera was arrested. Despite denying any involvement in the deaths of his mother and brother, he was still considered the main suspect, as it was revealed that, shortly before the crime, he had gotten into an argument with them. On the evening of December 21st, Ocampo was loitering around the parking lot of a shopping center in Placentia, where he proceeded to attack a 53-year-old homeless man named James McGillivray, whom he stabbed to death. The event was recorded on CCTV, and the police managed to release an identikit of the suspect. A week later, Itzcoatl committed another murder. The victim was 42-year-old vagrant Lloyd \\"Jim\\" Middaugh, who lived under a bridge crossing the Santa Ana River in Anaheim. Middaugh, like McGillivray, was fatally stabbed multiple times with a knife. Two days later, Ocampo killed 57-year-old Paulus Smit, stabbing him more than 60 times and then discarding his body onto the parking lot of a public library in Yorba Linda. By the time of the fourth murder, the news about homeless men being killed in Orange County spread in the Los Angeles media, leading police in several cities to enforce heavy duty patrols around homeless shelters and other areas where vagrants were known to reside. In early January 2012, several newspapers published a series of articles about the investigation into the killings: one, by the Los Angeles Times, interviewed a 64-year-old Vietnam War veteran named John Barry, who spoke extremely negatively about the perpetrator, and urged any potential victims to be as careful as they can in order to avoid being the next victim. As a result, Ocampo travelled to Anaheim and began stalking Barry, whom notified police on January 12th. He was asked to move into a homeless shelter, but refused. The following evening, Itzcoatl found Barry near a Carl's Jr. in Anaheim. Upon locating him, he attacked and stabbed Barry in front of dozens of witnesses, fleeing on foot after killing him.  Arrest  After killing Barry, a number of witnesses to the crime pursued Ocampo while others called the police. Itzcoatl tried to dispose of his bloodied clothing, but was arrested by the authorities about several hundred meters away from the crime scene without incident. When he was searched, a stainless steel knife with a 17.7 cm-long blade was seized from him. Ocampo was taken to the police station, where he was charged with killing John Barry based upon the available evidence. When he was investigated further, it was found that the murder weapon matched that used in the killings of the three homeless men, and Itzcoatl was additionally charged with their deaths as well. At a press conference, the Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas confirmed that he would seek the death penalty for Ocampo in his upcoming trial. On February 4, 2012, after analysing blood stains found on his shoes, Ocampo was linked to the Estrada-Herrera murders. He was charged with the double murder, and Eden, who by then had been detained for three months in the county jail, was released. Ocampo's father, brother and a number of acquaintances declared their belief in his innocence after Itzcoatl's arrest, stating that his personality wasn't that of a murderer and that since his dismissal, he had provided material support for his homeless father and others who lived on unemployment benefits. Ocampo himself pleaded not guilty after the indictment, with his lawyer declaring that his client was mentally unfit to stand trial.  Death  After the investigation was completed, the criminal case was sent to the court, with the trial scheduled to begin on January 17, 2014. On the evening of November 27, 2013, Ocampo, while sitting in his jail cell at the Orange County Jail, complained about being ill before vomiting and passing out. After first aid failed to resuscitate him, he was transported to the local hospital in Santa Ana, where it was determined that he had ingested a large quantity of Ajax, a laundry detergent. He died the following day, at 13:38 local time. During the subsequent investigation, it was determined that he had been collecting the detergent over several months, as it was given out daily in small quantities to prisoners so they could clean their toilets. The incident was ultimately ruled a suicide.

Life Darby was born in 1754 in Upperthorpe, Sheffield. She was one of the six children of Hannah (born Wilson) and John Barnard who was a tanner. She was brought up with a good education and knowledge of the Christian faith. In 1776 she married Samuel who was the son of Abraham and Abiah Darby of Coalbrookdale. The Darby family are credited with enabling the Industrial Revolution because of their transformation of the iron industry. Samuel was in charge of the Darby manufactory in London and that was where they first lived. Their first child died in 1778 and Samuel had poor mental health. In 1779 Darby and her husband moved into Sunniside with her mother in law Abiah Darby in Coalbrookdale. She began to transcribe her journal and she also began her own in August of that year. She had three more children and two survived childbirth, Samuel in 1779 and Edmund in 1782. She began to travel and to preach. Darby and Rebecca Young set out for the USA in August 1793. Darby is thought to have visited every meeting house. At the Long Island Meeting House she made a big impression on the French emigre Stephen Grellet who had a background in iron making before he had left France because of the French Revolution. Under her and William Savery's influence he decided to join the Society of Friends and he became an important figure in the Quaker movement. Darby, Savery and Grellet became friends and when Darby returned to Britain with Rebecca Young she was accompanied by four American Quakers (including William Savery) and her friend Stephen Grellet was there to wave them off. They sailed aboard the Sussex at a cost of ¬£210. Darby continued to travel and preach and returned to Coalbrookdale where she met Priscilla Gurney who was also a travelling Quaker minister. Elizabeth Fry who was trying to plan her life was staying with Gurney in the hope that her steadying influence might assist her. She had an important meeting with Darby who said that she saw that Elizabeth would influence many people. It was at this meeting that Elizabeth Fry realised that she was going to be a Quaker. She would later credit William Savery, Darby and Gurney with influencing her decision to devote her life to good works. Darby died in Coalbrookdale in 1810 and was buried beside her husband.

To secure raw materials for its mills, Gaiser delved into importing supplies from west Africa where it later became prominent in the export trade in Lagos between 1880 and 1900.  History  In 1869, the firm partnered with another Hamburg trader John Witt to buy the Lagos operations of Wilhelm O'swald. The Gaiser and Witt partnership lasted for seven years and thereafter, John Witt left to form another trading partnership. Gaiser gradually gained influence in the trade between Lagos and Hamburg. It earned this advantage due to ownership of it own steamships to trade in palm kernels and import of gin. After the acquisition of O'swald station, the firm continued with the former's import of cowries as a form of exchange before it introduced silver coins for commercial exchange. Gaiser's use of currency gave it significant advantage until competition from the African Banking Corporation challenged its leadership. Gaiser increased its specialization in the West Africa trade starting in 1899 after it sold its steamers to Woermann Line and sold off its oil mills in Hamburg.

Background  At the start of the year 1918, there were 370 Ukrainian Orthodox Churches, in the Kholm and Pidliashia regions, upon the declaration of Polish independence in 1918, around 320 of them were immediately converted to Roman Catholic Churches and the remainder were closed or destroyed. Only 50 Orthodox Churches remained for practice by an Orthodox population of an estimated 230,000. In response to the remaining Orthodox faithful whose refusal to convert was perceived as obstinate, the Polish authorities launched a campaign to convert \\"the Ukrainian Orthodox faithful to Roman Catholicism.\\" The resistance of the local population against efforts to convert led to the introduction of a policy of \\"revinidication\\". In 1938 a coordinating committee was formed and headed by General J. Morawinski who was delegated the role of implementing the plans, bolstered by the help of military garrisons. Acting in conjunction with the Coordinating Committee, the Polish press echoed calls demanding that Ukrainian Orthodox Churches start using Polish during liturgies and catechism classes, and introduced a new calendar for celebrating \\"Ukrainian religious feasts\\". Calls were also issued for Orthodox children to attend Mass in Roman Catholic churches and public assemblies were convened during which \\"resolutions were passed to destroy Ukrainian orthodox churches\\". In 1938 the Polish government issued an order instituting the use of Polish during sermons, in protest Ukrainian priests stopped giving sermons altogether. In July 1938, The Polish Parliament (Sejm) was the scene of protest, when Ukrainian members of parliament including the Orthodox Priest Reverend Martyn Volkov (Sarny), Stepan Skrypnyk and the Ukrainian Catholic Stepan Baran lodged a number of complaints \\"against the convention between Poland and the Vatican\\". Similarly, protests were also lodged by Ukrainian delegates Ostap Lutsky and deputy senator Mykola Maslov on 14th July 1938. During the session of Parliament, Sejm Deputy S Baran declared \\"As a Ukrainian and a Greek Catholic who is subject to the Apostolic capital and the pope, I declare that the question of the defence of the Orthodox Church is a national issue for the entire Ukrainian nation, and therefore we, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Galician deputies will be voting against [the signing of an agreement between Poland and the Vatican] in defence of the Orthodox Church which is dear to us, and in the interest of the Ukrainian nation, in the name of its historical and technical rights\\". As punishment for his stand, Rev. Volkov was stripped of his parish in Sarny and forced into hiding in the residence of Metropolitan Dionisii. In response to the recent actions in the Polish Parliament, the Lviv-based newspaper Dilo wrote on 9th July 1938 \\"Today in the Polish Sejm the representatives of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic and Orthodox population of Galicia, Volyn, and Pidliashia demonstrated their Ukrainian national unity and community in defence of national-religious positions.\\" The Polish parliament and Senate ignored the Ukrainians protests, and the convention was enacted on 20 June 1938 in the Second Polish Republic. According to the provisions of the convention \\"property that had belonged to parishes of the Orthodox Church and had temporarily belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was to be transferred to the Polish state\\". After ostensibly attaining the \\"legal right\\" to the Orthodox Church, the government of the Second Polish Republic launched the destruction of Ukrainian Orthodox Churches in the Kholm and Pidliashia regions in late June 1938. The auxiliary forces mobilized to assist with the operation included Polish state policemen, and Polish workers.  Result  The oldest church located in the Kholm Region was built in the village of Rozotka, immediately upon declaring independence the Polish government had closed the 16th century church and Ukrainian parishioners were permitted to attend Mass there only three times a year. On 8th July 1938 the church was destroyed. During the months of June and July 1938, a total of 112 church were destroyed in the Kholm and Pidliashia regions of the Second Public Republic. 98 of them had been constructed before the Union of Brest (1596) and included: the Church in Zamostia (1589), the Cathedral in Bila Pidliaska (1582), the Church in Kornystia (1578) and finally the Church in Shchebreshyn (1184). In his interpellation to then Polish Prime Minister Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski, parliamentarian Stepan Baran noted that \\"all of these gems of ancient Ukrainian architecture were utterly destroyed and irredeemably lost to civilization\\"  Reactions  On the 16th July 1938 Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, issue his archpastoral letter condemning \\"the acts of vandalism committed by the Poles, who had shown themselves to be the enemies of the Christian faith\\". In the letter Metropolitan Andrei deeply sympathised with his Orthodox brethren. The contents of the letter was not widely known, due to the fact it was seized by the Polish authorities. Ukrainian hierarchies abroad also reacted with indignation to the action of the Polish government, Archbishop Ioann Teodorovych, the metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the USA, \\"condemned the destruction of churches, the forcible conversion of Orthodox parishioners to Roman Catholicism, and the Vatican's illegal sale to Poland of Orthodox Church property, which it had never owned in the first place\\". = Polish Support and Rapport with Orthodox Ukrainians. = The Council of Bishops of the Orthodox Autocephalous Church in Poland vigorously protested against the destruction of the churches and on the 16th July 1938 issued a letter of indignation, that also reached only a portion of the population due to censorship.

In 1955 he was awarded a gold medal by the government for a series of stained-glass windows he designed for the church of San Nicolao della Fl√ºe in Lugano.Barnab√®, Duilio (2009). Duilio Barnab√®: Bologna 1914-1961 French Alps. Chicago: R.S. Johnson Fine Art. p. 19. . In 1957 he exhibited in the Musee de l‚ÄôAthenee in Geneva, Switzerland. He achieved recognition for his paintings of schematically ordered figures, still-lifes, and landscapes. He favored cool, subdued colors and sharply drawn edges. Backgrounds were usually monochromatic, and provided no details that would suggest a particular time or place. Flowers on a tabletop were a frequent subject, as were nuns, emblematic of his Catholic upbringing. In 1959 the art critic Dennis Farr said the influence of de Chirico and Metaphysical painting was evident in Barnab√®'s \\"starkly drawn puppet-like figures sliced geometrically into chiaroscuro\\".Farr, Dennis (1959). \\"London\\". The Burlington Magazine, 101 (675): 249‚Äì250. Barnab√®'s work was at its most abstract in the mid-1950s, as he reduced figures and still lifes to geometrical symbols. By the late 1950s his allegiance to realism caused him to experiment with adding more descriptive detail to his paintings, but he was dissatisfied with the result. This artistic problem, and a crisis of his loss of religious faith, left him mentally and physically enervated. On October 7, 1960, he attempted suicide by driving his car off a mountain road in the French Alps near the Swiss border.Barnab√®, Duilio (2009). Duilio Barnab√®: Bologna 1914-1961 French Alps.

Map of the Old Town streets Old Town (Stare Miasto) is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated September 16, 1994 in the first round. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. History The oldest part of Wroc≈Çaw is Ostr√≥w Tumski, which has been inhabited at least since the 9th century (nowadays it is part of the ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie district), and the accompanying estates on the right and left bank of the Oder River were soon established. Already in the 12th century, there was a market square on the left bank of the river (in the area of today's Market Hall and Nankier Square). The areas north of today's Nankier Square and Uniwersytecka Street belonged to the prince's domain and were not part of the later founding city. The Piast dukes settled Jews there, founded monasteries, and had their own manors. Breslau in 1660 In the 13th century, the town was under Magdeburg Law, and there are conflicting opinions of scientists about the order of spatial development of the town. Scarce information is provided by various records of foundations, consecrations of parish churches (St. Adalbert, St. Andrew, and St. Lawrence), as well as archaeological excavations. The first locations were made during the reign of Henry the Bearded, probably after 1212. Two settlements established on the orthogonal geometrical grid were created in this way: those called Skultetas in 1214 and Civitas Wratislaviensis (the City of Wroclaw) in 1226, and the Novum Forum (New Market) existing since around 1230. Probably the former occupied the area in the area of Piaskowa, St. Catherine, Wit Stwosz, and Latin streets (and thus around today's Nowy Targ), while the latter (despite the coincidence of names) was around the square known today as Rynek. The jurisdictional boundaries of the settlements were most probably determined by today's Szewska Street. Another hypothesis says that with the establishment of today's Market Square, the city was delimited within the Fosa River, which still exists today, and later it was temporarily reduced.Old Town OsiedleDuring the Mongolian invasion in 1241, the settlements were destroyed and rebuilt by re- location, joining them into one city and surrounding a defensive perimeter running in the line of today's Trasa W-Z. Probably the connection of the previously delimited towns caused a disturbance of the geometric grid between the Market Square and Nowy Targ. Already in 1261, the city was expanded to a new, external Fosa, and in 1263 an independent New City (Nowe Miasto) was established, incorporated into the main city in 1327.Jerzy Piekalski.

Uniwersytet Wroc≈Çawski Small extensions of the city area took place when the fortifications were extended. It was only in connection with the decision to demolish them in 1808 that Wroc≈Çaw was extended beyond the Old and New Town. During World War II, the Old and New Town was severely damaged. During the reconstruction, the emphasis was placed, for ideological reasons, on the preservation of objects from the Gothic era, i.e. from the times of the Piast rule. Many more damaged but newer buildings were demolished in order to obtain bricks. Apart from the Gothic churches, the reconstruction was first focused on the area of the Market Square, aiming to restore the state from the early 19th century.

Life  Born in Lemberg, Ettinger was the grandson of the Chief Rabbi of Lemberg and the son of the landowner Herz Ettinger. His mother, Ernestine Landau, gave him his first musical education. He was taught by tutors on his parents' estate and took his school-leaving examination at the old German-Polish grammar school in Lemberg. In Berlin, he tried to get accepted at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, but was not admitted. He received private lessons there in 1899 from Heinrich von Herzogenberg and Heinrich van Eyken in harmony and composition. From 1900 to 1903, he studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater M√ºnchen with Josef Gabriel Rheinberger, Viktor Gluth and Ludwig Thuille, with the latter privately until 1905. In 1906, he worked as a bandmaster in Saarbr√ºcken and in 1910 in L√ºbeck, but he gave up this job because of health reasons.

It was designed as a \\"\\" because it was designed to span the Otsu city area. After that, the originally planned \\"Kyoto Bypass\\" was transferred to the Meishin Expressway, and a new Gojo Bypass was constructed, so it was planned that a connection with National Route 1 would be established in Kyoto City as well. Then, due to the linear problem at the time of connection, the plan was changed to a doorway only on the Kyoto city side, and a trumpet interchange that was different from the actual one was planned. However, the residents of Otsu City objected to the fact that the doorway was only facing Kyoto, and had to severely cut down the mountain due to construction costs, making it difficult to construct a trumpet interchange, Japan Highway Public Corporation has decided to radically review the plan. Due to this plan change, an interchange will be added to the Otsu service area, and the shape has also been changed to a Y-interchange.

The collectives were formed by artists concerned with social justice, political activism, anti-Vietnam war protest, environmentalism, LGBT rights and Indigenous peoples' rights. Collectives also made posters for concerts, bands, marches and community groups. Feminists were active in the collectives and some were women-only collectives. The list of collectives and artists in this article indicates women were leaders in the poster collective movement, establishing groups, providing training, opening the groups up to other women and decision-making by consensus. The collectives were considered to be democratic art movements outside the gallery systems, able to quickly reflect changing social and political views and challenge social norms by designing, printing and displaying posters in public areas. Some artists were members of more than one collective and often did not sign their name to posters but attributed them to the collective. Similar collectives emerged in the UK, Europe, the US and Cuba during that time. This article covers Australian poster collectives from the 60s to 80s rather than later collectives from the 1990s such as RedPlanet.  Collections  Posters produced by the collectives are held in the National Library of Australia, National Gallery of Australia (NGA) , Flinders University Museum of Art (FUMA), Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA), Art Gallery of NSW (AGNSW), Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences and Tin Sheds Gallery at the University of Sydney.  Poster collectives and artists  Poster collectives were influential in developing the community arts movement and some of the collectives expanded into training workshops, community arts projects, community food co-operatives and other community support.. Some artists within these collectives later worked in partnership with community arts groups and/or developed their own individual art practices and careers.

It contains a single species, Changmiania liaoningensis. Discovery and naming The taxon is represented by two near-complete articulated skeletons: the holotype specimen, PMOL AD00114; and a referred specimen, PMOL LFV022. These remains were discovered in the Barremian age, 123.2 million years old, Lujiatun Beds of the Yixian Formation by local farmers and partially prepared. They were acquired by the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning at Shenyang, which completed the preparation. No indications were found that the fossils had been tampered with by fossil traders. The perfect life-like positions of these specimens suggest that they were buried alive, possibly in their own burrows. In 2020, the type species Changmiania liaoningensis was named and described by Yang Yuqing, Wu Wenhao, Paul-Emile Dieudonn√© and Pascal Godefroit. The generic name is derived from Èï∑Áú† (ch√°ng mi√°n), \\"eternal sleep\\" in Chinese, referring to the possible sleep position the fossils were found in. The specific name refers to the provenance from Liaoning. Description The holotype specimen has a preserved length of 117 centimetres. The describing authors established some distinguishing traits. Some of these were autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The frontal bones are elongated, over four times longer than wide. The parietals do not share a midline crest. The front branch of the squamosal bone is straight and elongated. On the upper rear corner of the squamosal a distinctive boss is present. The lower edge of the dentary is convex but the edge of the angular bone is strongly concave, resulting in a sinuous profile for the lower jaw as a whole. The neural spines of the sacral vertebrae are fused into a continuous elongated plate. Both the lower and upper end of the shoulder blade is asymmetrically expanded. The paired ilia are upwards and inwards inclined, covering the sacrum in top view. The upper part of the calfbone is as robust as that of the shinbone. Phylogeny In their phylogenetic analysis, Yang et al. (2020) recovered Chiangmiania as the basalmost ornithopod.

Affiliated with the Islamic organization Muhammadiyah, he had originated in Surakarta and served as a battalion commander in the Defenders of the Homeland organization, which resulted in his participation during the Indonesian National Revolution as an officer in his hometown. He was appointed as a minister by Sukarno despite protestations from his political party and Muhammadiyah, which opposed Muljadi's accommodation of Sukarno's actions. Early life Muljadi was born in Surakarta on 3 May 1898 and received education in Islamic institutions. Career =Pre-independence= For a time, he worked as an employee of the postal service. Muljadi helped with the 1934 founding of a radio station in Surakarta, the SRI (Siaran Radio Indonesia), and he later became a well-known broadcaster on that station. He was also active in various Islamic organizations prior to the outbreak of WW2. During the Japanese occupation period, Muljadi joined the Japanese-controlled Defenders of the Homeland (PETA) military organization, where he was appointed a battalion commander in Surakarta, along with a number of other kyai who were also appointed to similar positions in PETA. =Post-1945= During the Indonesian National Revolution, Muljadi became a leading figure within the pemuda movement in Surakarta, specifically the Barisan Banteng organization which he co-founded with Moewardi. At one point, when a leader for the newly formed People's Security Agency was about to select a commander, Muljadi was nominated as one of six potential candidates, and in a public vote just two voted for him, with most voting for either Sudirman (who won) and Urip Sumohardjo. Due to disputes between the central government and the local militants and authorities in Surakarta, Muljadi alongside other leading figures including Moewardi was briefly arrested in late May 1946. However, large-scale rallies coupled with an ultimatum from Barisan Banteng leader Sudiro who threatened to resign and hence leave the pemuda uncontrolled, resulted in Muljadi's release on 31 May. He again was arrested by Dutch authorities after Operation Kraai in February 1949 when he refused to join the Dutch-formed \\"Islamic Council\\" for Surakarta. Muljadi was a member of the where he served as chairman as early as 1951, and maintained his seat following the 1955 election. He was also a member of Masyumi and Muhammadiyah's leadership committees. He was present as one of five Masyumi representatives at the presidential palace in April 1957 after Sukarno decreed a state of war the previous month in the aftermath of the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet's resignation. As he approved of Sukarno's decision to issue said decree, he was later appointed a minister within the new Djuanda Cabinet. Johannes Leimena was initially appointed as Minister of Social Affairs, but as he was promoted to Deputy First Minister, Muljadi was appointed to replace him on 24 May 1957. While his approval was in line with some leaders within Masyumi, most of Masyumi and Muhammadiyah's leadership saw his actions as making the organization bow to pressure from Sukarno, which they saw as violating the constitution. Shortly after his appointment, the Muhammadiyah plenary meeting held on 1-2 June 1957 in Yogyakarta removed him from the organization's leadership committee (in which he was vice-chairman) and expelled from from the organization. After his appointment, Muljadi would serve as Minister for Social Affairs until the end of the First Working Cabinet, and then resumed his post with the title Junior Minister during the Second Working Cabinet, in which he also served as Minister for People's Welfare. In the Third Working Cabinet until the end of the Revised Dwikora Cabinet, he became Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare. He served one last ministerial term as Social Affairs Minister in the Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet. Muljadi was well known to be hostile towards the Communist Party of Indonesia and an ardent supporter of Sukarno, to the point where he commented that if Sukarno had been born in 571 AD, he would have become an Islamic prophet. He died on 23 October 1967 in his home in Jakarta due to a heart attack. He had been suffering from heart problems for some time before his death.

She was a commander of the Hukbalahap guerilla that fought for the country during and after World War II. War Before the war, Tapang worked as an organizer of the peasant organization -- Pambansang Katipunan ng mga Magsasaka ng Pilipinas (National Assembly of Farmers in the Philippines). When the Imperial Japanese army invaded the country, Tapang learned that many local women were being kidnapped and raped to be comfort women. Because of this, she reached out to the Hukbalahap and joined the guerilla at 19 years old. Due to her affiliations, Tapang was imprisoned by the Japanese government. When she was released, she joined the Hukbalahap's Apalit Squadron 104 in November 1942. She served as captain until December 1943. The Apalit Squadron 104 was deemed as one of the guerilla's strongest groups, considering that it is one of the most battle-tested squadron. In 1944, she was promoted to major under the 1st Regiment, Second Battalion Staff, Regional Command 7. Tapang recalled an incident as a captain, wherein her second in command refused to follow her order to form a V formation. She pointed her 37-cal. gun to him and spoke that he will have to obey, and so he did. Tapang took part in the Battle of Mandibi in Candiba, Pampanga in 1944, and it was a successful fight against the Japanese. Tapang led several successful combats against Japanese forces in Arayat, Pampanga. Tapang's first husband, a comrade-in-arms, was killed along with his team in an encounter in Candaba. Her second husband, also a Hukbalahap fighter, died during battle too. When the Japanese was quelled from the Philippines, the Hukbalahap evolved as Hukbong Magpalaya ng Bayan(HMB). The movement persisted during the American occupation due to the arrest and killings of Hukbalahap members that fought against Japanese colonizers -- instead of being recognized for their war efforts as allies. Thus, Tapang joined the HMB's Luzon Regional Command in Bataan. It was the movement's base of operations. There, she was captured together with her infant child. Luis Taruc, the Hukbalahap's supreme leader, spoke of Tapang as ‚Äúa big-bodied woman with a man‚Äôs strength, fond of wearing men‚Äôs clothes, adept at handling an automatic rifle, and able to hold command at the firing line.‚Äù Death On June 30, 2015, Tapang passed away due to cardiac arrest. She was 92 years old.

He was initiated into the society by Nikolaos Skoufas in Odessa, and in turn he initiated many others into the revolutionary society, some of whom became important figures in the events of 1821. Despite his efforts in promoting the society in its early years, he was accused of various misdemeanours and follies, and was eventually assassinated by other members of the society just a few years after joining.  Background and early life  Coat of arms of the Galatis family of Ithaca Plaque in Anogi, Ithaca, commemorating the revolutionary figure Nikolaos Galatis [el] (1792-1819) with his final words uttered while being assassinated, \\"What did I do to you?\\" Nikolaos Galatis was born in either Anogi or Kioni in Ithaca, Greece, to a noble family of the Ionian Islands who had first received noble privileges in the late 14th and early 15th centuries under the Tocco family. He is described by one report as 'a young Ithacan, handsome, from a noble family'. The only information known about the direct family of Nikolaos comes from the archival records of his being questioned by Russian authorities in 1817. He had a brother, Eustathios, an archimandrite, who attempted to seek revenge for his brother after he was assassinated in 1819. He styled himself as a 'Count'. According to his own account, his father was a diplomat: > I was born on the island of Ithaca. My parents, who are still alive, still > live there today. My father holds property there and is a diplomat by > profession. He was educated and cultivated, sufficiently so to join the Philomuse Society at Athens. He claimed to have been educated at the prestigious school at Kydonies (today Ayvalik, Turkey), and spoke Italian and French with sufficient fluency that he would use both of these languages professionally. He spoke French with Capodistria when the two met in Russia. After studying for an uncertain amount of time at Kydonies, he served as a scrivano (secretary) for Ali Pasha at Janina, for approximately 18 months. He was arrested by officials in British-ruled Corfu in February 1816, for reasons which remain unclear, and upon being asked why he believed he was being questioned, he responded: 'I do not know, I cannot think of anything other than because I worked in the service of Ali Pasha'.  Revolutionary activities  Toward the end of 1816, Nikolaos Galatis set off for Odessa (now Ukraine), where he met with members of the Greek community who were involved in the young revolutionary movement. In Odessa, he met members of the secret Filiki Eteria including Nikolaos Skoufas, Emmanouil Xanthos and Athanasios Tsakalov. He was soon initiated into the secret society by Skoufas, one of its founding members. He was either the third or fifth member of the society in sequence of initiation. After joining, in 1817, Galatis headed for Russia with the aim of seeking support for the Greek revolutionary cause. Galatis wrote to Ioannis Capodistria, Foreign Minister of the Russian Empire under Tsar Alexander I, whom he asked to allow him to come to St Petersburg in order 'to make an announcement of great significance'. The Tsar consented: > Write to tell him to come. It would be a good thing for us to see what kind > of person he is from up close. In St Petersburg, Galatis, who claimed to be a cousin of Capodistria's, asked him to take up the leadership of the secret society, which Capodistria resolutely refused. Capodistria as Foreign Minister was seeking to uphold Russia's peaceful engagement with its European neighbours (including with the Ottoman Empire), and the call to take part in the Greek revolutionary movement was untenable since it would threaten Russia's foreign policy. In St Petersburg, Galatis styled himself as a count and wore the uniform of the National Guard of the Ionian Islands. This led Capodistria to see him as 'nothing more than an adventurer', or as Capodistria later recalled his response to Galatis: > Sir, if anyone were to consider this plan, he would have to be insane; and > in order to speak to me about it in this place, where I have the honour to > serve a great and sovereign Monarch, he would have to be, as you are, a > young man who has just abandoned the rocks of Ithaca and is being led astray > by some blind passion. ... you must tell your command that, if they do not > wish to be destroyed and to lead their innocent and unfortunate nation to > ruin, they must give up their revolutionary activities, and to live as they > did before, under whichever government happens to exist, until such a time > that Divine Providence decides otherwise.

It ended with the defeat of the Bukhara army, and the transition of the Bukhara Emirate to vassal dependence on the Russian Empire.  Battle  After the capture of Samarkand in May 1868 by General Kaufman, in order to finally defeat the Bukharians, a campaign was undertaken in the direction of Bukhara. In the meantime, it became known that a large Bukhara army was gathering at the Zerabulak heights, located about half the way from Samarkand to Bukhara. According to intelligence, there were about 30,000 people in it. Having received such news, General Kaufman, leaving a small garrison in Samarkand, decided to advance with the main forces to meet the enemy. On the night of June 14, 1868, the Russian detachment approached the Zerabulak heights. At their foot stood the Bukhara infantry, behind it, on a hill - 14 guns and a mass of cavalry. The battle began at 4 am. Colonel Alexander Pistolkors, who commanded the vanguard, led his soldiers to attack the enemy's left flank. At the same time, the Cossacks moved, and the artillery began firing buckshot at the enemy infantry. The people of Bukhara, not expecting such pressure, wavered and ran. The Cossacks rushed in pursuit, but the Bukhara infantry, as soon as it emerged from the grapple fire, again lined up and began to retreat in an orderly manner, firing back and defending itself according to all the rules. Nevertheless, the entire hollow along which they retreated was covered with the bodies of Bukhara soldiers. On the right flank, a battalion of 280 Russian infantrymen who had gone into hand-to-hand combat was unexpectedly surrounded by the Bukharians: enemy infantry was pressing in front, cavalry came in from the rear. There was no way to help them, but, suddenly rushing into a bayonet attack, our soldiers overturned the enemy and got rid of the encirclement themselves, losing only 17 people wounded. The entire Bukhara army gradually began to retreat, at first in order, and then - throwing weapons and ammunition. By 10 o'clock in the morning everything was over, the heights were cleared of the enemy. Among the trophies of General Kaufman's detachment was an artillery gun and 40 pack boxes with shells.Military encyclopedia of Sytin. Zerabulak heights.

It was built in 1910‚Äì1913. New buildings also appeared during the Soviet period. It is located between Topolyovaya, Voennaya, Voinskaya and Boris Bogatkov streets and occupies an area of 85 hectares.What fate awaits the territory of the military town in Novosibirsk? Kontinent Sibir. History Construction of the residential building for twelve junior single officers, 1913. =Construction= In 1909, the City Public Administration of Novonikolayevsk (current Novosibirsk) transferred a place of 60 dessiatins to the military department in exchange for the territory of The Cabinet of His Imperial Majesty (in a convenient place for the city). The land for the future military complex was located across the Kamenka River. In the summer of 1910, the construction of military corps began, 5 million rubles were allocated for their construction. In June 1910, the newspaper Obskaya Zhizn wrote about the large number of workers involved in the construction of the military complex. They had come from the European part of Russia. Their working day began at 5‚Äì6 a. m. and ended late in the evening. Monthly salary of workers was 18 rubles, they were also provided with free food and housing. The Military Town in 1913. The construction of the military town was completed in the summer of 1913. 37 buildings were built, including barracks, residential buildings, warehouses, hospital, church, etc. =World War I period= During the First World War, the number of military units noticeably increased in Novonikolaevsk. The lack of places in the military town contributed to the fact that many military institutions began to be deployed outside of it. At the same time, the construction of new buildings of the military complex was postponed indefinitely due to lack of funding. =Russian Civil War= At the beginning of 1918, the detachment was formed, which consisted exclusively of volunteers from prisoners of war of the Austro- Hungarian and German armies. It was located in the military town and underwent additional military training here. In the spring of 1918, the detachment, led by a member of the Novonikolaevsk Council I. P. Botko, went to the Trans- Baikal Front to oppose Lieutenant General of the White Army G. S. Semyonov. During the Civil War, the Military Town was also occupied by the Kolchak Army, the Czechoslovak Corps and Polish legionaries. According to the recollections of residents of Novosibirsk, one of the buildings of the military complex was occupied by arrested persons (about several hundred people), including Magyars who served in the International Battalion named after Karl Marx and members of the Soviet and party apparatus of Novonikolaevsk, among whom was V. R. Romanov, chairman of the Novonikolaevsk Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. =Typhus epidemic= In the winter of 1920, a typhus epidemic spread in the town. Military doctors called it \\"an endangered place\\" and assumed that soon this district of Novonikolaevsk would turn into a cemetery. The White Guards, who were imprisoned in the unheated stables and sheds of the Military Town, suffered from tuberculosis, typhus and died in large numbers.

He made an in-depth photographic study of Toronto during the 1950s and was one of the country's leading photo-journalists during the 1960s. Biography Thomas Henry Lambeth was born in Toronto in 1923. After serving in the Canadian Armed Forces (1941‚Äì1944), he studied art in London and Paris (where he changed his name to ‚ÄúMichel‚Äù). In 1952, he returned to Canada an artist with a wife and an as yet undetermined path in making art. He worked at a day job as a clerk at City Hall in Toronto and experimented with film at night. In 1955, he took up photography with a Rolleiflex (2¬º sq. format) camera and inspired by Toronto's Kensington and St. Lawrence Market districts, began an intensive study of the vibrant street life of Toronto. From 1956 to 1958, he worked with a Leica (35 mm) camera. His heroes in photography were individuals such as Henri Cartier- Bresson and Brassai, and like them he sought to discover ‚Äúthe decisive moment‚Äù (as Cartier-Bresson called it in his landmark 1952 book, The Decisive Moment) in his subjects through his camera. His photographic work was described as European in style, conveying a human interest story, compassionately shown and told. In 1972, he said about his work: > ‚ÄúAfter six years in Europe, returning to Canada turned me back to the > streets of Toronto where I had grown up. The first images were extremely > nostalgic. I photographed the children and grandchildren of the Macedonians, > the Greeks, the English, the Irish, the Scottish, who had come to Toronto ‚Äî > just as my father did ‚Äî about 1910. I photographed my coequals as though one > day they would suddenly disappear ‚Äî as I had, momentarily ‚Äî to war in Europe > or elsewhere.‚Äù At the same time, he continued writing fiction. In 1959, he became a free- lance photographer full-time. He was published in Life, Star Weekly and Maclean's, as well as becoming a reviewer for magazines and photographing the Isaacs Group, artists affiliated with the Isaacs Gallery. In 1962 to 1964, he photographed the community of the parish of St. Nil, Gasp√©, Quebec, for Star Weekly, which did not publish it (the negatives were acquired later by the National Film Board's Still Photography Division). In 1965, Lambeth had a solo exhibition at the Isaacs Gallery. In 1967, he published historical photographs he saved from the garbage in his book, Made in Canada. In 1968, although the Star Weekly ceased publication, his work was included in group shows in the U.S.A. and France and in 1969, he was given a solo show at the National Film Board (today the Canadian Photography Institute at the National Gallery of Canada). In 1972, he reacted to the hiring of an American chief curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario and, along with others, chained himself to office furniture in the premises then occupied by the gallery to gain attention in the media. In 1973, he worked for the Toronto Free Theatre as an associate artist but the fee was meagre. He continued his involvement in cultural politics, often against the Art Gallery of Ontario, protesting the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, and a photography show organized by the Extension department, as well as protesting the National Film Board's Bicentennial project. In 1976, he found himself unable to find work and went on social assistance. Legacy Lambeth died in 1977, leaving behind an archive of \\"thousands of negatives\\". After his death, the National Film Board's Gallery in Ottawa hosted a tribute to his work. A write-up in The Ottawa Citizen called Lambeth \\"an independent photographer in Canada before that was acceptable or even respectable.\\" The Ottawa Journal wrote that \\"Lambeth produced a sensitive social document of the lives of working class people, revealing their inner strength and dignity.\\" Library and Archives Canada hosted a major retrospective in 1986, Michel Lambeth: Photographer, curated by Michael Torosian. In celebration of the show, in 1987, Michael Torosian published the limited edition book Michel Lambeth: The Confessions of a Tree Taster, a memoir by Lambeth of his youth, his discovery of Europe, love and art. To celebrate the key role of the Isaacs Gallery and the artists associated with Avrom Isaacs, the Art Gallery of Ontario did a two-person show in 2005 titled Isaacs Seen: Two on the Scene of Michel Lambeth and Tess Taconis. In 2014, Canada Post released seven stamps honouring master photographers. Among them was Michel Lambeth\`s photograph of St. Joseph's Convent School taken in 1960.

The evidence was originally available in the Chinese language. Gao Wenbin's teacher Liu Shifang, a renowned lawyer and professor at Shanghai Soochow Law School who was also a classmate of the Chinese prosecutor Xiang Zhejun recommended Gao Wenbin to be the translator for Xiang Zhejun. Wenbin was appointed after passing a translation test conducted by Xiang Zhejun. Gao Wenbin was also appointed as one of the prominent members of the Chinese delegation at the Tokyo Trial in 1946 due to his technical fluency with the Anglo-American law and also for his sound knowledge in both English and Japanese languages.

History The street lay outside Roman Eboracum, and although it was crossed by a Roman road, evidence of occupation in the period is limited to two wharfs on the River Foss, and some burials. The road appears to have developed in the Viking Jorvik period, during which it mostly hosted industrial and commercial uses. The street was first mentioned in about 1080, as \\"Walbegate\\", suggesting it may be named after an individual called \\"Walba\\". Walmgate Bar, the gate at the south-east end of the street, was built before 1155, but the section of the York city walls enclosing the street was built later: permission to construct this section of the walls was granted in 1267, and they were not completed until 1505. By 1200, Walmgate was an important street, with four churches: St Denys, St Margaret, St Mary and St Peter-le-Willows, of which the first two still survive. The Haberdashers' Hall was built on the street, as were large houses for the Percy and Neville families. Many of the boundaries between building plots date from this period. The area around St Margaret's church became known for fullers. A seafish market was held on the street in the Mediaeval period. In 1590, a cattle market was established, held every second Thursday, and from 1632, an annual cattle fair was also held. By the 19th-century, it was causing serious congestion on the street, and in 1826 was moved to a dedicated cattle market outside the walls. Walmgate Bar was the focus of the Siege of York in 1644, and some buildings on the street were damaged, although most of the destruction occurred outside the city walls. In the 1840s, many immigrants from Ireland moved to Walmgate, and by the end of the decade, it and the surrounding streets and alleys housed half of the population of the whole city. Overcrowding and poverty were rife. St George's Catholic church was built a short distance from the road. The street also became known for its pubs, peaking in 1901 with 20 on the street. There was also some industry: the Victoria Iron Foundry, Caroline Place linen mill, and a brewery. Many buildings on the street were demolished as part of slum clearance schemes in the 20th-century, and since 1950, some council flats have been built. Nikolaus Pevsner described the street as \\"depressing\\" in 1972, but by 1995, David Neave described it as \\"improved... most of the waste spaces have been filled, but there is still much to be done\\". It is currently lined with a mix of independent shops, pubs and restaurants, offices and housing. Layout and architecture The Bowes Morrell House The street runs south-east, from Foss Bridge over the River Foss, continuing the route of Fossgate. At the other end, it runs through Walmgate Bar, then ends at the city's inner ring road, at the junction of Lawrence Street, Barbican Road and Foss Islands Road. Merchantgate, Dennis Street, St Denys Road, George Street, Margaret Street, and Hope Street, all lead off the south-west side of the road, while Hurst's Yard, Paver Lane, and Navigation Road, lead off the north-east side. Notable buildings on the north-east side include Dorothy Wilson's Hospital, built in 1812; the 18th-century houses at 6, 8, 24 and 26-28 Walmgate; a 15th-century timber-framed building at 32 Walmgate; 34 Walmgate, built about 1700; 68-70 Walmgate, and a warehouse behind 72 Walmgate, also of 18th-century origin; St Margaret's Church, now the National Centre for Early Music; and the Bretgate Flats, built in 1979, and described by Neave as \\"most successful\\". On the south-west side are the 15th-century Red Lion pub, now often described as lying on Merchantgate; the 18th-century 9 and 11 Walmgate; 19 Walmgate, with a 16th-century wall; 23 and 25 Walmgate, both of 17th-century origin; 35-37 Walmgate, built in the 16th-century; the 15th-century 77 Walmgate; St Denys' Church; and Bowes Morrell House, built about 1400.

Scientific results  Shevchenko's main contributions are studies of the phase dependence of the brightness and the opposition effect of asteroids. Based on the results of photometric observations, he determined the phase functions for different types of asteroids, studied the opposition effect up to extremely small phase angles (less than 1 degree), found some dark asteroids without an opposition effect, and determined the exact albedo for dozens of asteroids. Shevchenko proposed an analytical expression for the phase function of asteroids. He established a strong correlation between the asteroid's albedo and the slope of the phase dependence, which can be used to determine the albedo.Li J.-Y., Helfenstein P., Buratti B.

She began her career as a copywriter in the educational department of Time Inc. from 1949 to 1952. After Whitney was fired in part for supporting Adlai Stevenson II during the 1952 United States presidential election, she was made chief copy editor of homemakers magazine Better Living in 1954, and was made its editor-in-chief two years later. Between 1956 to 1967, she worked as associated editor and later executive director of Seventeen magazine. In the 31 years she was editor of Glamour magazine, Whitney oversaw an increase in readership and advertising revenue, and introduced new features and columns to it. She also put a black model on its front page in 1968, making Glamour the first American mainstream magazine to put an African American on its front cover. Whitney was president of the American Society of Magazine Editors between 1975 and 1977, and was inducted into its Editor's Hall of Fame in 1997. Early life Whitney was born on July 23, 1928, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. She was the third and youngest child of gravestone and mausoleum designer Leonard G. Reinke, and his wife, Helen Diestler Reinke, a homemaker. Whitney grew up in a bungalow in the city, and was taught at Oshkosh High School. Her teachers were complimentary about her writing, and encouraged her to enter her work into national competitions, earning her a duo of honorable accolades for two of her editorials. She also wrote for the school newspapers The Arrow and The Index. After graduating in 1945, Whitney won a four-year full-tuition scholarship to study at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with honours in June 1949. Career After relocating from Evanston, Illinois to New York City, in 1949, she obtained her first job, working as a copywriter in the educational department at Time Inc, when the company moved their offices to New York. In 1952, Whitney was fired, in part for supporting Adlai Stevenson II during the 1952 United States presidential election whereas others at her workplace supported Dwight D. Eisenhower, making her disenchanted and less willing to work. She discovered she could find work at Newsweek and Fortune among other publications; she said later in life that this was because \\"she had a uterus\\", and sought employment on women's magazines. Whitney took up work as chief copy editor of homemakers magazine Better Living in 1954. Two years later, she was named the magazine's editor-in-chief at age 27. After Better Living ceased publication in 1956, Whitney was appointed associate editor of Seventeen. She was promoted to executive director of Seventeen in 1962, serving in the post until 1967. In January 1967, Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., chairman of media company Cond√© Nast, employed Whitney as editor-of-chief of Glamour. She oversaw an increase in advertising revenue from $11.7 million per year to $137.3 million, and was responsible for raising Glamour's readership by almost one million (or 54 per cent) to 2.3 million. Whitney read reader's letters as well as authorizing public surveys to get opinions on topics such as contraceptives, inter-racial dating, the Vietnam War, infertility, and date rape. She also oversaw the magazine win various awards from organisations such as the National Magazine Awards. In 1968, she successfully convinced Cond√© Nast to feature Newfoundland black college student Kiti Kironde II on Glamour's front cover that August, making the magazine the first mainstream one in the United States to put an African American on its front cover. Whitney also put another black model on the cover, and repeated this for at least the following two years thereafter. Throughout the 1970s, she introduced multiple how-to-do guides authored by specialists to recognize the changing needs of college students and working women, and new columns on health, home economics, love, and sex. In the 1980s, Whitney oversaw the introduction of Washington Report to inform women about legislative issues affecting them and new congressional women. She also added the regular feature New Tech to help women become more acquainted with computers. A five-year national survey on family, money, sex and work published in January 1987 was the catalyst for her to publish more columns and featured articles, such as The New Racism: Don‚Äôt Deny, Ignore, or Accept It addressing resurgent racism in September 1987. Whitney devoted 24 pages of the January 1990 issue to Men and Romance, yet the lead article was The Sexually Confidant Woman to retain Glamour's tradition to maintain a balanced points of view. In late 1991, she introduced the Truth in Fashion column, taking an investigative approach to the fashion industry. In September 1997, Cond√© Nast president Steven Florio assured Whitney she would be allowed to retire when she was ready. But on August 17, 1998, Newhouse suggested to Whitney it was the right time for her to retire, and informed her he had employed former Cosmopolitan editor Bonnie Fuller to fill her former position. Her final day as Glamour's editor-of-chief was October 5, 1998, and she admitted to being disappointed that Newhouse did not consult her about being replaced and publicly felt Fuller was not the best selection. Whitney serving 31 years as editor-in-chief of Glamour was the longest tenure for the editor of a major women's magazine in the 20th century. Between 1975 and 1977, Whitney was president of the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME). She continued to serve as ASME's executive committee from 1989 to 1992. Whitney was a feminist and served as member of the National Organization for Women (NOW) Legal Defense Fund, causing her to encourage features focusing on women in less traditional careers such as engineers, lawyers, and sportswriters in the 1970s. In 1980, Whitney earned the Matrix Award from Women in Communication, and in 1993, she received the Cosmetic Executive Women Achiever Award. She was a member of Northwestern University's Council of 100 Women, and was named recipient of the 1996 Henry Johnson Fisher Award from the MPA ‚Äì the Association of Magazine Media. Whitney's only book, Feminism and Love: Transforming Ourselves and Our World, was published in 1998. Personal life She married fellow Northwestern University alumni Daniel Whitney on November 19, 1949. They had one son. In February 1995, Whitney's husband predeceased her from prostate cancer. She was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1997, causing her to lose the ability to speak and swallow, and died from the condition at her home in Irvington, New York, on June 4, 1999. Approach and legacy Whitney was frank, kept a low profile as editor by not running a note at the front of Glamour, intelligent, open-minded, and was highly private about her personal life. She said her approach was not to make feminism intimidating but accessible to American women, and was pragmatic to including fashion items in the magazine, asking fashion editors, \\"Where is she going in that?\\" before allowing clothing that was photographed to be included in the publication and kept such coverage to slightly more than 50 percent of editorial content. In 1992, Whitney asked Newhouse to establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University to mark her 25th anniversary as Glamour's editor-in-chief. She was inducted into the Oshkosh High School Hall of Fame in February 1982, and was admitted into the ASME's Editor's Hall of Fame in April 1996. Whitney was posthumously named a Glamour Woman of the Year in November 1999.

However, he was captured by Fu Hong and was later executed after he assassinated him.  Service under Later Zhao  Ma Qiu's earliest mentions was in 333, during Shi Hu's control over the emperor Shi Hong. Around this time, the powerful Di chieftain Pu Hong broke away from Later Zhao.

The Duan tribe was on the verge of collapsing but by this point, Shi Hu had realised that Yan was not interested in letting Zhao benefit from the war. Shi Hu ordered Ma Qiu to retrieve Duan Liao, who had offered his surrender at Mount Miyun. The Yan general Murong Ke ambushed Ma Qiu at Sanzangkou (‰∏âËóèÂè£, in present-day Chengde, Hebei), leaving three-fifths of his army dead.

Ma Qiu conquered Jincheng, where the Prefect Che Ji (ËªäÊøü) refused to surrender to him and committed suicide. Ma Qiu then conquered Daxia after Liang's general Liang Shi (Ê¢ÅÂºè) arrested its Administrator Song Yan (ÂÆãÊôè) and handed over the city. Ma Qiu forced Song Yan to write a letter to the Commandant of Wanshu (ÂÆõÊàç, in present-day Guanghe, Gansu), Song Ju (ÂÆãÁü©) convincing him to surrender but he refused. Instead, he killed his own wife and kids before taking his own life.

Ma Qiu would advise Fu Hong to concentrate in conquering Guanzhong while Ran Min and Shi Zhi were at war. Fu Hong agreed but Ma Qiu was not as loyal as he thought. At a feast, Ma Qiu took the chance to poison Fu Hong and took over his army. Unfortunately for him, the plan failed, as Ma Qiu would be quickly arrested and executed by Fu Hong's son, Fu Jian.(ËªçÂ∏´Â∞áËªçÈ∫ªÁßãË™™Ê¥™Ë•øÈÉΩÈï∑ÂÆâÔºåÊ¥™Ê∑±ÁÑ∂‰πã„ÄÇÂ∑≤ËÄåÁßãÂõ†ÂÆ¥È≥©Ê¥™ÔºåÂ∞á‰∏¶ÂÖ∂Ë°Ü„ÄÇ‰∏ñÂ≠êÂÅ•Êî∂Êñ¨Áßã„ÄÇ) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 4  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)

The main cause of the strike was related to graduate students' objection to the university's plans for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional calls were made by the union for defunding the campus police. The strike started on September 8, 2020 and was scheduled to last for four days, with a subsequent vote extending the strike for another week. Following the start of the strike, resident assistants and student employees for the university's dining services announced they would also strike over similar concerns regarding the university's COVID-19 policies. On September 16, union members voted to end the strike, with work resuming the following day.  Background  Prior to the strike, graduate student instructors (GSIs) at the University of Michigan expressed objections to the university administration's plans for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 31, members of the Graduate Employees' Organization, the graduate student employee union at the university, protested outside the house of President of the University of Michigan Mark Schlissel and organized a die-in. On September 7 (Labor Day), the union announced a labor strike that would start the next day following a general membership vote held the previous day that saw 80% of voters approve strike action. According to the GEO president, just under 600 members voted in favor of striking and slightly less than 100 voted against it, with some members unavailable for the vote due to being away for Labor Day Weekend. The strike was scheduled to last for four days, with a vote scheduled afterwards that would extend the strike for another week if union demands were not met. A previous strike organized by GEO in 2008 had lasted only two days. Demands by the union include a universal right to work remotely, increased COVID-19 testing (including random testing) by the university, and defunding the police on campus, with 50% of the campus police's budget to be reallocated towards community programs. The Lecturers' Employee Organization (LEO), the union for lecturers at Michigan, announced on Labor Day that they support the GSIs' strike and share similar concerns over the campus's reopening policies. However, LEO officials reminded members that they would not be participating in the strike, and that any members involved in strike action would be subject to disciplinary action. In response to the call for a strike, the university highlighted that the strike would violate both the law of Michigan and the contract between the union and university signed in April 2020. Additionally, the university claimed that some of the demands from the union could not be resolved through collective bargaining or contract renegotiations. The Detroit-based alternative newspaper Metro Times called the university's actions \\"ironic,\\" considering that their response came on Labor Day, a day strongly tied to the American labor movement.  Course of the strike  The strike began on September 8, with GSIs performing a work stoppage and picketing around the university campus. That same day, the university filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union for violating terms of their contract. Later that night, the Central Student Government Assembly, a student government at the university, unanimously passed a resolution in support of the strike, urging students to not attend classes in solidarity with the strikers. The next day, September 9, over 100 resident assistants at the university announced that they would also go on strike, demanding both better protections from COVID-19 and hazard pay. Additionally, graduate student unions at Harvard University and Western Michigan University expressed support for the strike, and some construction workers at the university joined striking GSIs on their picket lines. That night, the union held a general meeting where they voted to reject a proposal put forward by the university that would have ended the strike. The proposal had been supported by GEO leadership, but was rejected by an \\"overwhelming majority\\" of the general membership, with 736 voting to reject, 428 voting to approve, and 81 abstaining. Following the rejection, the university issued a release describing the proposal in greater detail, also claiming that the strike has disrupted thousands of classes since its start and reiterating the illegality of the strike. The university also claimed that they would rescind their unfair labor practice charge and not penalize striking employees if a deal could be reached that would end the strike. On September 10, student employees for the university's dining services announced they would perform a walkout the next day to also protest the university's COVID-19 policies. The strike expired that same day, with a vote scheduled over the next two days that would determine if the strike would be prolonged. By September 13, the union announced that 80% of the votes cast were in favor of extending the strike for another week. The next day, President Schlissel announced that the university would be seeking a restraining order and a preliminary injunction against the union through the Washtenaw County Circuit Court to stop the strike. According to the university, the union could be held in contempt of court and face civil damages if the injunction is granted. That same day, U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan voiced her support for the strikers, accusing the university of \\"union-busting via the courts.\\" On September 16, the GEO held a press conference on the steps of the Hatcher Graduate Library where they elaborated on some of their anti-policing demands and spoke about the support they had received on both a local and national level. The conference included several members of the university community discuss their concerns with the university's COVID-19 response. On the night of September 16, the union held a vote during a general meeting regarding a continuation of the strike. Ultimately, the union voted to end the strike with a vote of 1,074 to 239, with 66 members abstaining. Statements by the union claimed that the university made \\"substantial movements\\" on all of the union's demands, including policing reforms that had not been addressed in the university's first proposal to the union. As part of the end to the strike, the university agreed to drop its case with the Circuit Court to intervene in the work stoppage. Ultimately, the strike was the longest in GEO history since 1975.

In 1884 he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets, and consecrated as a titular bishop of Duvno, and succeded Szymon Marcin Koz≈Çowski as Bishop of Lutsk-Zhytomyr- Kamyanets.  Early life  Cyryl Lubowidzki was born in Durkhiv near Rivne in the Berezne parish (Diocese of Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets) as a son of Ignacy and Tekla n√©e Podhorecka (Pohorecki). He came from the Lubowiecki (Lubowidzki) family, originating from Lubowiec in Lipno County. After the initial home studies, he studied at a gymnasium in Zhytimyr, and then, at the age of fourteen, he entered the seminary in Lutsk in 1837 (a year later he received the sacrament of confirmation). His then rector, Fr. Wiktor O≈ºarowski (grandson of the infamous Hetman Piotr O≈ºarowski), saw in the young alumni a talent for learning and obtained permission from Bishop Piwnicki to send him to Vilnius to study theology there. Lubowidzki started the studies in 1841, but a year later he moved with the Vilnius Clerical Academy to Saint Petersburg. There, on 22 June 1845, he obtained a master's degree in theology (on the same day as Szymon Marcin Koz≈Çowski, who is almost four years older). Recommended by the rector of the St.Petersburg Academy, Fr. Ignacy Ho≈Çowi≈Ñski (later Metropolitan of Mohliev), after his return to his mother diocese, on 11 October 1845, he was appointed professor of dogmatic theology at the theological seminary in Zhytomyr, although he was only a seminarian of minor orders. He was ordained a priest only after the age of 24 on 12 September 1847 in the post-Augustinian church in Vilnius, by the local suffragan Kazimierz Dmochowski, who was elevated to the metropolitan capital in Mogilev the next year, and who had also previously ordained him to subdiaconate (20 March 1847) and the diaconate (3 April 1847). In the Zhytomyr seminary, Fr. Lubowidzki taught continuously for 31 years, until its forced closure on 15 November 1876. During this period, he also experienced constant kindness from Bishop Kasper Borowski, who held the episcopal office from 1848 in the Diocese of Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets, his former professor of Church history and canon law at the Spiritual Academy. The same shepherd first appointed him an honorary canon on 5 October 1850 and on 8 December 1855, a general canon (and deputy custodian) of the cathedral chapter of Zhytomyr. He also appointed Lubowidzki in 1856 the visitor of the diocesan seminary, a duty he held for 16 years, until 1874 when he became a member of the bishop's consistory and the inspector of monasteries in the diocese. In addition to didactic work (apart from dogmatic theology, he also taught catechism, ritual and church singing, and took care of the seminary library) and curial work, the future shepherd was active in pastoral ministry, first as a parish priest in Kotelnia (1857-59), and after a fifteen-year break, in a similar function in Vinnitsa in Podolia, which he retained until his episcopal nomination (1874-84). In turn, in the structure of the cathedral chapter, he was promoted to scholastic (1861), cantor (1864) and archdeacon (1866), and finally in 1876 to become the dean prelature. As such, he was elected on 9 July 1878 the capitular deputy to the Catholic Theological College in Saint Petersburg, but before the necessary approval by the secular authority took place, he was elected on 5 September of the same year by the chapter the administrator of the diocese in place of the deceased Fr. Prelate Maksymilian Roszkowski. After prior approval of this election by the government authorities, on 13 November 1878, a canonical mission from the Holy See entrusted him with the administration of the Diocese of Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets at the same time.  Apostolic administrator and bishop  As an administrator, he managed to obtain from Emperor Alexander II a decision to re-establish the diocesan seminary (5 January 1881), closed in 1876, which actually resumed its activity on 29 November 1881. At that time, the seminary building in Zyhtomyr was renovated. In matters entrusted to his care, Fr. Cyril Lubowidzki had to go directly to the government bodies in Saint Petersburg in order to seek the implementation of the postulates put forward directly at the highest authorities of the Russian Empire. After less than five years of administration, on 1 July 1885, he had to greet the new shepherd of Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets, Bishop Szymon Marcin Koz≈Çowski (his friend from the time of his studies at the St. Petersburg Theological Academy), to whom he handed over the office. Thanks to the efforts of the same ordinary, Fr. Cyril Lubowidzki was appointed in 1884 to the post of suffragan of Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets, which had been vacant for ten years (his predecessor, bishop Ludwik Bart≈Çomiej Brynk, died on 19 September 1874). At the consistory on 24 March 1884, Pope Leo XIII preconised him as titular bishop of Duvno and auxiliary for Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets (at the same consistory also four other suffragans for Catholic dioceses in the Russian Empire were nominated). The consecration of the nominee took place on 29 June 1884 in the church of St. Katarzyna Aleksandryjska in Sankt Petersburg, and was led by the Metropolitan of Mogilev, Aleksander Kazimierz Gintowt- Dziewa≈Çtowski, together with the Lutsk-Zhytomyr-Kamyanets ordinary, Szymon Marcin Koz≈Çowski and the Tyrespole suffragan, Antoni Jan Zerr. Less than a year and a half after his elevation to the dignity of the Ordinary, on 9 June 1898, during which the Solemnity of Corpus Christi fell, Bishop Cyril Lubowidzki died after long-suffering in his bishop's residence in Zhytomyr. Funeral ceremonies were held in the local church of St. Zofia on 14 June 1898, on which day the cathedral canons also elected the capitular vicar for the duration of the vacancy in the person of the local suffragan, preconized less than a year ago by Boles≈Çaw Hieronim K≈Çopotowski.

Early Life And Education  Celai was born in 2008 in Sacramento, California, United States and is the youngest of six children. She still maintains her academic proficiency despite her modelling and entrepreneurial career and hopes to attend Howard University.  Modeling  Celai was originally discovered at a skating rink when she was three years old by a local photographer. In several interviews, Celai says it was during this photoshoot where she discovered her love of modeling however being only three years old, she was unable to communicate this with her parents, who were very skeptical. Celai received her first modeling contract at the age of four but her parents did not sign. She received her second modelling contract at the age of five and since she was finally able to communicate her love of modeling, her parents signed the contract. She has worked with brands like Gap, Walmart, Target, Disney, Justice, Google, Amazon, The North Face, Fabkids, American Girl and All-state.  Actress  Celai has appeared several short films, with one premiering at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018. She has also appeared in several commercials and was the leading lady in Willie William's music video \\"Vodoo Song\\" that has been viewed over 20 million times and most her films are in her IMDB page.  Texture Activist  From an early age, Celai loved her big natural hair that would often attract a lot of attention. At her request, Celai often wore her hair out in a big afro to school. By the end of the school year, Celai's mom noticed some of the older girls wearing their hair out as well. In 2015, Celai's mom started her Instagram page and Celai quickly became known as the little girl who loves her big hair after images began to be shared across several social media platforms. This is when Celai started her own business, TheChattyChick.com, becoming the CEO and the face of the brand, at the age of seven. In January 2018, after observing multiple negative experiences with hairstylists on set, Celai and her mom decided to start making hair tutorials to show the versatility of natural ethnic hair. Several of these videos received viral numbers across social media. During NYFW (September 2018), Celai demands to wear her hair \\"shrunken, just as it grows out of my scalp\\" and this propels her to become a Texture Activist, pushing the media to show more texture diversity and partnering with World Afro Day in London, UK. In 2020, Celai openly shared all her experiences in the industry and called for better training for hairstylists who are booked to work on set with ethnic talent, as well as the inclusion of all textures of hair. She continues to use her voice and her platform to push for the change and inclusion in the media because #KinkyHairMatters.  Runway  While rehearsing for a local fashion show, a NYFW photographer approached and said she was ready for NYFW. She was eight years old when she first walked in NYFW (September, 2016). The following season (February, 2017), Celai again walked in NYFW, at Madison Square Garden and in interviews, her mom describes as the day she was blown away and said \\"Who is this girl and who taught her that?!\\" Celai states \\"I walked out and had a whole new walk!\\". She also admits when working with runway coaches, they were simply working on poses or runway etiquette, not her actual walk. At the age of nine, Celai walked at Style Fashion Week Los Angeles (October, 2017). Only hours after delivering her viral runway performance, Celai walked in an all-adult lineup for the very first time, for Mario de la Torre, which landed her a feature in the LA Times Newspaper. In April 2018, Celai makes her very first runway appearance at Style Fashion Week Palm Springs with Mario de la Torre, wearing her first pairs of heels. And in September 2018, Celai becomes the youngest professional runway model to walk amongst an all-adult lineup in NYFW as she closed the opening NYFW show for David Tupaz Couture. Only days later, Celai opened for designer Ugochi Iwuaba's NYFW debut and her video immediately went viral. For this show, Celai decided to wear her hair \\"shrunken, just how it grows out of my scalp\\" as her way of showing girls with hair like hers that their hair is indeed beautiful, no matter anyone says.  Show Producer  in 2019, Celai became the youngest show producer to produce a runway show during NYFW with The Industry Fashion Show.  Environmentalist  In 2019, Celai vowed to plant a tree for each t-shirt sold at TheChattyChick.com. As of January 2019, she has planted over 260 trees globally.  Personal life  Most of the activities of Celai's social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are controlled by her mother Linda Ligons-West where she said on her daughter's verified Instagram said \\"Celai is the youngest self-taught pro runway model\\" and \\"we've never taught her how to walk, she literally taught herself!\\"  Author  After receiving numerous inquiries from parents asking how to get their kids into runway, in 2019, Celai and her mom teamed up to write The Parent's Guide to Kids Runway and The Parent's Guide to Kids Runway For Brown Girls.  Coach  In 2018, Celai began runway and conference coaching. In 2019, she learned up with Plus-Sized Super Model Liris Crosse, from Project Runway 16, for Project Slay, an intensive coaching and information panel. She also led the Curls, Catwalk and Confidence class in London, for World Afro Day 2019. She looks forward to continuing to tech confidence and runway techniques.

Starbuck was a 19th-century New York pilot boat. She was one of the few pilot-boats to take the offensive in the Great Blizzard of 1888, when she ran into the steamship Japanese and survived one of the most severe recorded blizzards in American history. She was one of the last pilot boats that were sold in an age of steam and electricity. Construction and service  The William H. Starbuck was built to take the place of the Mary and Catharine, pilot-boat No. 6, which sank by the steamer Haverton, off Absecon Lighthouse on November 5, 1885. The new William H. Starbuck, was launched from the shipyard J. S. Ellis & Son, at Tottenville, Staten Island on May 30, 1886. Emma Devere broke a bottle of champagne over her bow to christen her. About a thousand people witnessed the launching, including William H. Starbuck, Captain Josiah Johnson of the Edmund Blunt, No. 2, James Hawkins of pilot-boat No. 4, as well as others. She was named after William H. Starbuck, a railroad financier, who paid for the cabin and presented the colours, including the signal flags. The Starbuck was modelled after Hempton Ellis and her lines were drawn by Howard I. Chapelle. The owner was pilot Jacob M. Heath, and her captains were Archibald Heath, Henry Devere, James Devere, Frederick Ryerson, and Oscar Stoffreiden. On March 10, 1888, the William H. Starbuck, No. 6, was run down by the British steamer SS Japanese, off Barnegat, New Jersey during the Blizzard of 1888. Six men were on board, including Captain Oscar Stoffreiden and Pilot Jacob M. Heath. Charles Edward Russell, describes this accident in great detail in his book From Sandy Hook to 62¬∞. Russell said that \\"the stern of the steamer crashed down upon the bow of the pilot-boat and broke off her bowsprit, short.\\" Some of the other men jumped to the Japanese, but Pilot Jacob M. Heath and three other men still aboard the Starbuck, pushed forward, made a sail on the foremast and sailed back to Sandy Hook. A few months later, boatkeeper, Joseph Douglass fell overboard and drowned when the boat was off Absecon. Pilot Heath tried to save him but could not recover the body. The Starbuck came into port with her colours at half-mast. Out of service On February 1, 1896, the New York Pilots discarded sixteen sailboats and moved them to the Erie Basin in Brooklyn. They were replaced with new up- to-date steam pilot boats. The William H. Starbuck, was sold for $5,000. See also *List of Northeastern U. S.

During his university training, he frequently traveled abroad to learn new scientific methods and techniques from other prominent European scientists. Although his earliest publications dealt with phytogeography and phycology (particularly the green alga known as the desmids), his most notable research was in plant physiology. Early in his career, he published seminal work on the flow of water through the stems of woody plants, and investigated the phenomenon of transversely geotropic plant organs. In contrast to his works on plant physiology, his later experiments and views on lichens, which he himself considered his most important work, was far less favourably received. Elfving became a Professor of botany at the University of Helsinki in 1892 after a fierce competition, a position he held until his retirement in 1926. A lively and enthusiastic teacher, Elfving revolutionized the teaching of botany at the university by introducing laboratory courses that emphasized the study of plant physiology, rather than taxonomy, as had been the tradition. During his time as professor, Elfving wrote many historical papers about scientific societies, and biographies of Scandinavian scientists. He wrote the books T√§rkeimm√§t viljelyskasvit (\\"The Most Important Crops\\") and the Kasvitieteen oppikirja (\\"Botanical Textbook\\"), which were widely used as textbooks. Elfving has had several taxa named after him. Early life and education Elfving was born on 9 December 1854 in Eken√§s, Southern Finland, to parents Johan Fredrik and Wendla Elfving. His father, who was originally the son of a blacksmith, rose exceptionally high in the order of estates at the time, becoming a professor and . His mother, Wendla Elfving (n√©e Sucksdorff), belonged to the Loviisa bourgeois family. Fredrik was the youngest of nine children. His eldest sister, (1837‚Äì1923), much later became an author of popular historical novels in Finland. Fredrik Elfving graduated with honours as a student in 1870 from Turku High School. From an early age young Elfving began to train for a career in medicine. As a child he started an interest in natural history, and became familiar with the local cryptogam flora ‚Äì mosses, lichens, and algae. Access to a microscope, given to him by his parents on his 15th birthday, enhanced his interest in this field. Elfving in 1873, about 19 years old Elfving intended to enter medical school, but first had to obtain a Candidate of Philosophy degree, with a specialization in botany. His instructor, Sextus Otto Lindberg, found Elfving to be a quite talented student, and assisted and encouraged him with his botanical studies. With the support of the University, Elfving stayed in Stockholm and Uppsala for six weeks in the autumn of 1873 to study phycology. Elfving obtained his Candidate of Philosophy degree on , at age 20, which allowed him to enter medical school, but he gave up on this plan after a couple of years. Deciding to study botany instead, in 1875 he took a trip to Russian Karelia to investigate the plant life there. Elfving obtained a Master's degree in philosophy on . He officially began training in botany in 1878, after moving to Germany. Elfving's first scientific publication, titled Anteckningar om vegetationen kring floden Svir (\\"Notes on the vegetation around the river Svir\\"), dealt with phytogeography. It was the first reasonably complete compilation of the flora of this region, and largely modelled upon Johan Petter Norrlin's 1875 work Flora Kareliae Onegensis. From 1878 to 1879 he completed his studies in Germany, first learning cytology with Eduard Strasburger in Jena and then, in W√ºrzburg with Julius von Sachs. The experiments he performed with Sachs formed the basis of his doctoral dissertation, which he defended successfully in 1879 at the age of 24. It was titled Studier √∂pver geotropiska v√§xtdelar (\\"Studies on geotropic plant parts\\"). Elfving became a Doctor of Philosophy on February 3, 1880. In 1881 he was appointed docent of botany. Also that year, Elfving published Anteckningar om finska Desmidieer (\\"Notes on Finnish Desmids\\"), in which he enumerated 258 species of the Desmidiales, 9 of them new to science. This work helped initiate the study of phycology in Finland. =Study abroad= Later that year, Elfving went abroad to study under the supervision of Heinrich Anton de Bary in Strasbourg. At the invitation of the , he participated in the preparation of a new pharmacopoeia for Finland in the winter of 1883. In 1886‚Äì87, wanting to learn about new methods for culturing bacteria and other microorganisms, Elfving went to Copenhagen to learn these techniques from fermentation physiologist Emil Christian Hansen and the physician and bacteriologist Carl Julius Salomonsen. After this he studied for a few months under George Engelmann in Utrecht, and then with Gaston Bonnier and √âmile Duclaux in Paris from December 1886‚ÄìMarch 1887. Elfving attended academic conferences in Stockholm (1880), in Kristiania (1886), and in Berlin (1886). Career In 1885, Sextus Otto Lindberg proposed that Elfving should be appointed associate professor, emphasizing his outstanding record as a teacher. The newly appointed professor of zoology, Johan Axel Palm√©n, objected to the proposal, suggesting that the comparative merits of Elfving and the other docent, Edvard August Vainio, be compared for fairness, especially considering that Vainio had a far superior record as an independent researcher. Although Lindberg's proposal was upheld by a majority in the Department of Natural Sciences, the matter was shelved at a higher level and the initiative went nowhere. Imperial Alexander University around 1870 After the death of Lindberg in 1889, the position of Professor of Botany was opened. After a fierce competition with the other docents Edvard Vainio and Oswald Kairamo, Elfving was appointed to the position. Elfving was the chairman of the Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica (Finland's oldest scientific society) from 1892‚Äì1911, and he was the permanent secretary of the Societas Scientiarum Fennica (Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters) starting in 1923. Elfving also served as Dean of the Department of Physics and Mathematics from 1911 to 1924. A professor for 34 years, Elfving retired at the age of 71 in 1926. Elfving helped contribute to the acceptance of Darwinism in Finnish academia. In 1883, a year after Charles Darwin's death, the idea of placing a commemorative statue of him in the British Museum of Natural History spread throughout Europe. A petition to that effect was published in the Finnish newspapers, and it was signed by, among others, five prominent biologists, one of which was Elfving. In Finnish academic circles, there were prejudices against lower-class students among those of a higher class during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In the 1880s, the rapid expansion of schooling led to a debate on whether there were now too many students, and what inflationary effect this was having on standards. Elfving wrote in 1885: \\"We know all too well those young men with questionable talent and even more questionable tidiness, who are from uncultivated homes sent to study at university. After their studies they begin to talk about the 'cause of the people' as apostles of civilization in various parts of the country.\\" Elfving's concern about lower-class 'apostles of civilization' preaching Fennomania was not groundless, since as many as half of the teachers that had been Vyborg Nation students (from Viipuri Province, a historical province in Finland) came from a lower-class background. In contrast, , who was Elfving‚Äôs colleague, explained that in his experience, the worst students actually came from higher class families. To get into university, lower-class students had been already forced to show that they were both talented and studious. In 1894 Elfving started an inquiry into the distribution of plants in Finland. From the 373 responses he received, he assembled the work Anteckningar om kultur v√§xterna i Finland (\\"Notes on the culture of plants in Finland\\"), which was considered an important summary of the cultivated and decorative plants in late 19th-century Finland. In the work Atlas de Finlande (1899, 1910) Elfving and Arvi Grotenfelt contributed short surveys of economically important cultivated plants in Finland. In the early decades of the 20th century, the language issue heated up emotions in university academia. Elfving strongly supported the use of Swedish, which led to the establishment in 1925, alongside his position of Chair of Botany, of a new professorship in Finnish. Kaarlo Linkola was appointed to this position. After Elfving's retirement, the duties of the head of the department were transferred to the holder of the new Finnish-language chair. Eventually, in 1928, Alvar Palmgren was elected as the new Swedish-speaking professor of botany, filling Elfving's old position. =Research= Fredrik Elfving in 1880, age 26 Plant physiology Elfving's doctoral dissertation dealt with investigating why the rhizomes of many plants take up a horizontal position in the soil. His research determined that the tips invariably turned in such a direction as to bring the longitudinal axis back into a horizontal position in the ground, a reaction caused by the force of gravity. So in addition to having positively and negatively geotropic organs, the plant also has organs that orient themselves at right angles to the direction of the gravitational pull ‚Äì these are called transversely geotropic. Although the idea had been suggested previously by Albert Bernhard Frank in 1868, Elfving was the first to prove it experimentally. Frank believed the transversely geotropic organs had an upper side that faced upwards; Elfving showed that this was not true for rhizomes, since if they were turned round their own longitudinal axis 180¬∞, they continued to grow without any torsion. In 1882 Elfving published the results of an investigation carried out in de Bary's laboratory into the flow of water through ligneous stems. At the time, it was widely believed that the water did not flow through the lumina of the vessels, but in their walls, the so-called \\"inbibition theory\\" proposed by Julius von Sachs. Elfving disproved the idea in an experiment in which he caused melted cocoa butter to be sucked into the stem of a freshly cut Taxus, which he then allowed to cool and harden. Microscopic examination showed that the fat had filled the lumina of the vessels but had not penetrated into their walls. The stem's ability to conduct water was virtually eliminated, showing that water did indeed flow through the lumina, and disproving Sach's theory. Views on lichens In contrast to Elfving's works on plant physiology, which have generally stood the test of time, his views on lichens, which he himself considered his most important work, was far less favourably received. In his class teachings, Elfving had initially subscribed to the generally accepted view on the dual nature of lichens as proposed by Simon Schwendener in 1867. As time passed, however, his doubts about the validity of this theory grew. He questioned whether it was conceivable that lichens should owe their existence to a \\"continually repeated accident\\" ‚Äì the chance meeting of fungus and alga. He thought that if he could show that there was a genetic connection between the two components of the lichen, it would effectively destroy Schwenderer's theory. After many years of research, in 1913 Elfving published Untersuchungen √ºber Flechtengonidien. In this work, he claimed that he had established by microscopic observation that the gonids (an old term in lichenology for the algal cells of the thallus) originated in the hyphae, and proclaimed that Schwenderer's theory must therefore be abandoned. However, by 1913, it was well-established that the \\"gonids\\" in the lichen thallus are actual green and blue-green algal cells, and if Elfving's view were to be accepted, it would essentially overturn the entire taxonomy of cryptogams. Although he understood the revolutionary implications of his hypothesis, he remained unwavering, certain that he would ultimately be proven to be correct. It has been suggested that his method of using material that had been fixed, cut, dyed (rather than keeping a direct watch on development in vivo) gave the false impression of a continuous process of development, leading to erroneous interpretations of his observations. His work was either criticized, or ignored completely. He published a continuation of his research 18 years later, titled Weitere Untersuchungen √ºber Flechtengonidien, which he started with the motto E pur si muove. This work was met with a reception similar to his previous one, including another sharp rebuttal by Wilhelm Nienburg. =Students= As part of his duties as Professor of Botany, Elfving mentored a number of students who undertook research in plant physiology. Doctoral dissertations resulting from these collaborations include the following: Walter Laur√©n (1891), who studied the influence of ether vapour on germinating plants; (1914); on the nitrogen nutrition of the fungal genus Aspergillus; (later Forss) (1914), on the occurrence of starch in bryophytes; Runar Collander (1919) on thermotropism in plants; Harry War√©n (later Waris) (1920) on pure cultures of lichen gonidia; and (1920) on trace element requirements and starch formation in Aspergillus. Elfving's students who specialized in phycology include the following: Karl Engelbrecht Hirn, who specialized in the family Oedogoniaceae; Alexander Luther, who proposed the existence of the Heterokontae; Rolf Gr√∂nblad; ; and . Personal Fredrik and Thrya Elfving, Helsinki, mid 1920 Elfving married Thyra Ingman (1870‚Äì1939), with whom he had four children, two girls and two boys: Rabbe Fredrik Elfving (1899‚Äì1966), Brita Elfving (1900‚Äì1917), Astrid Elfving (later Kyreniua) (1902‚Äì1982), and Erik Gustav Elfving (1908‚Äì1984). His youngest son Erik Gustav became a well-known mathematician and statistician. Regarding his personality, his former student Runar Collander noted: \\"Elfving stood in a class by himself, combining a strict sense of duty with an exceptional charm. He was renown for his skill in repartee, and his witty, lapidary remarks were widely quoted.\\" Early in his career he would often engage in polemics on general cultural subjects, often on the pages of the journal Finsk Tidskrift. He was at one time on the editorial board of this journal, starting in 1877, and later became one of its publishers, from October 1883 to December 1885. He also frequently wrote for ', a Swedish newspaper published from 1861 to 1889. Collander writes of the \\"curious duality\\" of Elfving's nature: Fredrik Elfving died on 21 June 1942, at the age of 87. Legacy Elfving was one of the first researchers in plant physiology in the Nordic countries. In the 1880s, Elfving published a number of plant physiological studies, helping to raise the profile of plant physiology as a science to counterbalance the emphasis placed on taxonomy and morphology prevalent since the influential publications of Carl Linnaeus. Of the native plants, Elfving specifically studied certain algae (in particular, the family Desmidiaceae) as well as crops. In all, during his career, he published about 50 original studies. Elfving was a keen historian, and wrote numerous biographical articles, the first of which dealt with Linnaeus. In addition, he wrote about the history of science of Finland and the university. He made centenary accounts of Finland's two oldest scientific societies, the Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica and Societas Scientarum Fennica. Elfving was noted for his \\"highly developed historical sense\\" and his \\"skill in the production of vivid and sharply-etched portraits of personalities.\\" Commemorative medal with image of Finnish academic Fredrik Elfving, presented to him on December 11, 1924 Elfving developed university teaching in botany and introduced, among other things, laboratory exercises in teaching. He introduced microscope training as applied to vascular plant anatomy in 1880, the year before his appointment as docent. A decade later, this course was made compulsory for all botany students. This first laboratory course was later followed by a microscope course in cryptogam systematics, class work in experimental plant physiology, and courses in organography and seed plant taxonomy. Sometimes, more specialized courses were arranged for students especially interested in botany. Topics included the examination of microscopic algae and the cultivation of bacteria. Contemporaries praised his lecturing skills. Elfving had developed a reputation as a \\"very colorful and strong personality\\" and an \\"excessively demanding teacher\\". Botany was still a compulsory minor for medical students in the early 20th century, which made the medical faculty upset by the fact that Elfving was allegedly severely hindering the studies of medical students, even though botany was not particularly relevant to medicine itself. His son Gustav, who had his own academic career at the University of Helsinki, would later recall meeting people who, upon hearing his last name, \\"immediately recalled the feared oral examination given by his father some decades ago, which they had flunked several times!\\" Elfving published several textbooks that would help him and others teach their botanical courses more efficiently. The first edition of Kasvitieteen oppikirja (\\"Botanical Textbook\\") appeared in 1903, the fourth in 1930. Deviktigaste kulturv√§xterna was first published in 1895. Two other texts he published were V√§xtanatomiska √∂fningar (\\"Exercises in plant anatomy\\") (1889) and F√∂rare genom V√§xthusen i Helsingfors Botaniska Tr√§dg√§rd (1904), a guide to Helsinki's botanical gardens aimed at both the general public as well as the first-year university student. The texts were well received and described as featuring clear and concise presentation, similar to the teaching style of Elfving. The botanical museum at Kaisaniemi Botanic Garden, Finnish Museum of Natural History ‚Äì LUOMUS, University of Helsinki The Department of Botany, which was completed in 1903 in Kaisaniemi, Helsinki, and now houses the University's Botanical Museum, was built on Elfving's initiative and according to his plans. Elfving worked for the Institute of Botanics in the Botanical Garden and lived with his family at the Professor's residence. He worked hard to acquire numerous species of shrubs and trees in his role as director of the Botanical Garden, and the greenhouses became a landmark attraction. Eponymy Taxa that have been named after Elfving (eponyms) include the polypore genus Elfvingia ; the lichen taxa Rhizocarpon grande f. elfvingii ; Aspicilia elfvingii ; and Celidium varians subsp. elfvingii , as well as the algae Cosmarium elfvingii , Diploneis elfvingiana ; the plant Hieracium elfvingii ; and the wasp Phygadeuon elfvingi (Hellen, 1967).

It is also called as ‡§ß‡•à‡§µ‡§§. More information and importance of Dhaivata The following is the information about Dhaivata and its importance in Indian classical music: * Dhaivata is the sixth svara in an octave or Saptak. * Dhaivata is the immediate next svara of Panchama (Pa). * The svara of Dhaivata is Komal and Shuddha. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç - 6, ‡§ú -‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ . Therefore, it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. So the svara Dha is formed from Sadja. * The frequency of Dhaivata is 400 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Dha after the Pa of 320 Hz (Taar Saptak) has a frequency of 800 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Dha. There are 3 Shruti's of Risabha. Previously the main Shruti, not only for Re but for all the other svaras, was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shrurti. For example, if these are the 3 Shruti's of Re then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Re. ^ 1 2 3 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Re. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras , since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras * Ragas from Bhairav Thaat, Poorvi Thaat, Asavari Thaat, Bhairavi Thaat and Todi Thaat have Komal Dhaivata. * Ragas where Dha is the Vadi svara - Raga Bhairav, etc. Ragas where Dha is the Samvadi svara - Raga Kalingda, etc. * Hypothetically speaking, Dha is said to be Dharma, Dharma as in, the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva were first created i.e. Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and then these three gods created Rishimuni i.e. Re and then Gandharvas were created for singing and then lord Indra or Raja Indra i.e. Mahipal was created and once the Mahipal (Raja) or the king was created, the Praja or the common citizens or the people were made, and as people have their own Dharma or duty/religion, the religion was made.

It is responsible for the analysis and risk mitigation of large-scale cyber threats and vulnerabilities, communicating information regarding malicious cyber activity or possible vulnerabilities to computer security incident response teams (CSIRT) and the public..  Background  TR-CERT was established on the 27th of May, 2013 within the ICTA, in accordance with the 4. clause \\"National Cybersecurity Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan\\" (Turkish: Ulusal Siber G√ºvenlik Stratejisi ve 2013-2014 Eylem Planƒ±) issued by the Cabinet of Turkey and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey.  Mission  The mission of TR-CERT is to protect the Turkish government's and its citizens' cyberspace, taking measures for the protection of critical infrastructures, both public and private, such as the energy production and distribution, water management, and telecommunication institutions and facilities in Turkey. TR-CERT also takes both proactive and reactive actions toward cyber incidents that would affect the country as a whole, such as botnets, malware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. There are over 1300 CSIRTs and over 4000 cyber security professionals in nearly every sector in Turkey that coordinate with TR-CERT regarding cyber incidents. These CSIRTs are mostly institutional CSIRTs (such as the CSIRT of a bank), but there are also industry-specific CSIRTs that coordinate with TR- CERT (such as the CSIRT of the finance industry).  Activities  The Cyber Star (Turkish: Siber Yƒ±ldƒ±z), a 24-hour online capture-the-flag cybersecurity competition organized by TR-CERT, had over 20,000 contestants working in either teams or individually, during the latest competition held in February 2019. In the previous Cyber Star event held in January 2017, TR-CERT had nearly 15,000 contestants and some of the most successful contestants were hired by TR-CERT later on. In December 2019, TR-CERT organized the \\"Cyber Shield 2019\\", an international cybersecurity exercise with simulated cyber attacks, malware, phishing, and industrial control systems (ICS). Held at the ICTA headquarters in Ankara, contestants from 17 countries competed to identify cybersecurity emergencies and take the necessary measures within the scenarios and technical infrastructure prepared by TR-CERT. The exercise was supported by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) agency of the United Nations and the Cybersecurity Alliance for Mutual Progress (CAMP). International Cyber Shield 2019 was organized to increase preparedness to combat against cybersecurity incidents and foster international cooperation in dealing with them. On the 10th of February 2020, TR-CERT's security operations center (SOC) was officially opened, with the attendance of the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said > \\"We aim for Turkey to not only be a consumer of technology, but also be a > country that designs, develops, produces, and markets technologies to the > world. The security dimension of digital transformation is at least as > important as the physical defense of countries.\\" Cooperating with \\"ICTA Academy\\" (Turkish: BTK Akademi), TR-CERT has given various cybersecurity trainings, ranging from web application security to computer forensics. Similarly, TR-CERT gives one-on-one, hands-on training to cybersecurity enthusiasts in the Fetih Cyber Drill Field Some of the other events organized and/or attended by TR-CERT include: * TR-CERT - CSIRT Advisory Meetings * Energy Sector CSIRTs Meeting * NATO CMX-2017 and CMX-2019 Crisis Management Exercises Due to TR-CERT's contribution to the cybersecurity ecosystem in Turkey, between the years 2017 and 2018, the ranking of Turkey on the Global Cybersecurity Index (GTI) published by ITU went up by 23 ranks, going from 43 to 20 within a year.

Established about 1820, it is at one of the town's largest cemeteries. It was created on land formerly owned by the locally prominent Reed/Reid family, and includes the burials of some of the town's notable 19th and 20th-century residents. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. It is presently restricted to burials related to existing interments. Description and history Hubbardston's Rural Glen Cemetery is located about one mile (1.6 km) south of the town center, on the west side of Worcester Road south of its junction with Old Princeton Road. It is bounded on the north and south by two other municipal cemeteries, Brookside and Evergreen cemeteries; all are identified by signage, and Rural Glen Cemetery is further differentiated from its neighbors by a picket fence along the road. It is predominantly a level grassy expanse, with trees at the fringes. The rear of the cemetery is bounded by the Ware River. Near its center is a flagpole flying the American flag. The oldest burial in the cemetery is dated 1820, and is of a five-year-old child. The cemetery was formally established by a sale of land in 1875 by members of the Reed family, who have a raised and fenced plot in the south rear of the cemetery. Among the Reed family burials is that of Colonel Micajah Reed, a state representative in 1839-40. Members of the Wheeler family, whose ancestors were prominent in the town's early history, are also interred here.

The town took over management of the cemetery from a private association sometime after 1978.

She is remembered for writing and illustrating rhyming Swedish children's stories, including Pojkarna Igelkotts vinterskor (1948) and Nickes lediga dag (1950). They depict everyday life in a playful, humorous style, often with animals as the principal characters. Her poetry collections are inspired by children in the home environment, sometimes depicted as animals, sometimes as human beings. Biography Born on 2 May 1902 in √ñvre Ullered, V√§rmland, in west central Sweden, Eva Hildegard Maria Forss was the youngest child of the factory owner and agronomist, Johan Albin Forss and Gerda Ingeborg Tereseia n√©e Kjellmark. After completing her school education, she attended the Techical School in Stockholm where she trained as a drawing instructor and advertising artist. She remained at the school teaching calligraphy from 1925 to 1968. In parallel, in 1925 she became an illustrator for Svenska Journalen, creating the children's series Kajsa och Snurran with rhyming text, published in book form in 1929. She became particularly productive and creative from the late 1940s, initially with Pojkarna Igelkotts vinterskor, a picture book for small children about a family of hedgehogs with other characters as animals, birds and insects. Her playful rhyming children's stories about everyday life continued in N√§r John Blund f√∂rsov sig (1949), and Nickes lediga dag (1950). Her poetry was published in Godmorgon och godnatt (1951). In 1949, she illustrated Astrid Lindgren's short story series Nils Karlsson-Pyssling. Thanks to her innovative styles, Svensk Bokkonst selected her works as √Örets utvalda b√∂cker (books of the year) in 1946, 1948, 1949 and 1950. Eva Billow died in Stockholm on 22 February 1993.

The game takes place in a space-themed setting in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks. Through a plurality vote, players believed to be Impostors may be removed from the game. If all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed, the Crewmates win; if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved, the Impostors win. While initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received an influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. In response to the game's popularity, a sequel, Among Us 2, was announced in August 2020. However, a month later in September, the planned sequel was canceled, with the team instead shifting focus to improving the original game. Among Us has inspired internet memes and achieved a large following online.  Gameplay  alt=A white-suited astronaut named \\"Buddy\\" (the player) is standing in front of an unnamed blue-suited corpse. The room they are in is labeled \\"Admin\\". In the hallway, slightly obscured by the sight line mechanic, is a pink-suited astronaut named \\"Chum\\". In the upper-left corner of the player's screen there is a fake list of tasks as well as the player's goal: to kill all Crewmates. The player also has the option to Use, Report, Sabotage, and Kill. As the player has just killed, the button is on cooldown and faded. Among Us is a multiplayer game, supporting four to ten players. One to three of these players are randomly selected each game to be Impostors, while the rest are Crewmates. The game can take place on one of three maps: a spaceship (The Skeld), a headquarters building (Mira HQ), or a planet base (Polus). Crewmates are given \\"tasks\\" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems, such as electrical rewiring and fueling engines. Impostors are given a fake list of tasks in order to blend in with Crewmates, although they are unable to complete any task. They have the ability to sabotage the map's systems, traverse vents to get around the playing space quickly, work with and identify any other Impostors, and kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost; ghosts can pass through walls, but can only interact with the world in limited ways and are invisible to everyone except other ghosts. However, they must still complete their tasks. All players, aside from ghosts, have a limited cone of vision, only allowing them to see other players within a certain unblocked distance around them, despite the game's top-down perspective. The Crewmates win by completing all tasks or by finding and eliminating all the Impostors. For the Impostors to win, they must either have a sabotage countdown run out or kill enough Crewmates such that the number of Impostors is equal to the number of Crewmates. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing sabotages (as an Impostor). When an Impostor performs a sabotage, either there is an immediate consequence (such as all the lights being turned off or doors being closed) or a countdown begins. In the latter case, if the sabotage is not resolved before the countdown finishes, the Impostors win. Sabotages can be resolved by living players in varying ways depending on which sabotage is performed. Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition; a player quitting is equivalent to them being eliminated, and a Crewmate quitting leads to their tasks being considered completed for the total. Any living player who finds a dead body can report it, which halts all other gameplay and calls a group meeting. In the meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the evidence surrounding the killing. To help determine the identity of Impostors, there are various tracking systems in each map, such as a security camera system in the Skeld, a doorlog in Mira HQ, and a vitals indicator in Polus. If a plurality vote is reached, the chosen person is ejected from the map and dies. Living players may also call an \\"emergency meeting\\" by pressing a button in the map at any time, except when a sabotage is in progress. Players can communicate in a text chat, but can only speak during meetings, and only if they are alive, although ghosts can speak with one another at any time. While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord while playing. In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as the vision range of the Crewmates and the Impostors, and the number of emergency meetings. There are also many cosmetic options, including spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets, some of which are paid downloadable content.  Development and release  = Early development = Among Us was inspired by the real-life party game Mafia (also known as Werewolf in some areas), and was initially intended to be a mobile-only local multiplayer game with a single map, and due to this initially had no sound, as to avoid revealing hidden information. Designer Marcus Bromander paused development on studio InnerSloth's other game, The Henry Stickmin Collection, in order to build the game's first map, the Skeld. Among Us was released in June 2018 to Android and iOS, under the AppID of \\"spacemafia\\". Shortly after release, Among Us had an average player count of 30 to 50 players simultaneously. Programmer Forest Willard deemed that \\"it didn‚Äôt release super well\\" which Bromander believed was because studio InnerSloth \\"[is] really bad at marketing\\". The team intended to \\"[give] up on it several times\\", but continued work on it due to a \\"small but vocal player base\\", first adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, customization options, and later on November 16, 2018 it released on Steam. Cross-platform play support was available upon release of the PC version. On August 8, 2019, InnerSloth announced a second map, Mira HQ. A third map named Polus was added later that year on November 12, 2019. Both maps initially required an additional payment of US$4, however their prices were reduced to $2 on January 6, 2020, and then later made free on June 11, 2020; while the map packs are still available for purchase on all platforms, they no longer provide access to the maps, instead only giving the player the skins that were bundled with the maps. According to Willard, the team \\"stuck with [the game] a lot longer than we probably should have from a pure business standpoint\\", putting out regular updates to the game as often as once per week. This led to a steady increase in players, \\"snowball[ing]\\" the game's playerbase. Bromander stated their ability to do this was due to them having enough savings, allowing them to keep working on the game even while it was not selling particularly well. = Popularity =  Beginning and cause of popularity  Twitch streamer alt=Sodapoppin in a purple Twitch hoodie While released in 2018, it was not until mid-2020 that Among Us saw a surge of popularity, initially driven by content creators online in South Korea and Brazil. Bromander stated that Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea are even more popular locations for the game than the United States. According to Willard, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin made the game popular on Twitch in July 2020. Following this, many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers began playing Among Us, including prominent content creators xQc, Pokimane, Shroud, Ninja, and PewDiePie. The COVID-19 pandemic was frequently cited as a reason for the popularity of Among Us, as it allowed for socialization despite social distancing.  Emma Kent of Eurogamer believed that the release of InnerSloth's The Henry Stickmin Collection also contributed to Among Us' popularity, and PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon believed Twitch streamer SR_Kaif \\"primed Among Us for its big moment.\\" The game's similarities to other popular tabletop games that had been inspired by Mafia, such as Secret Hitler, was also listed by Fenlon as a reason for the success of Among Us. Some of these Mafia-like games had been previously adapted to computer games, such as Town of Salem and Werewolves Within, but Fenlon saw these as \\"just add[ing] an online interface for the basic Werewolf rules,\\" whereas Among Us was an entirely new take on the concept.  Continued popularity  A alt=A character sheet for a green-suited astronaut named \\"Seven\\" The game's popularity continued into the following months; YouTube reported videos about Among Us were viewed 4 billion times in September 2020. TikTok videos related to Among Us had over 13 billion views in October 2020. In September 2020, the game exceeded 100 million downloads, and its player count rose to 1.5 million concurrent players,  * nearly 400 thousand of which were on Steam, then peaked to 3.8 million in late September. This sudden increase in players overloaded the game's server, which according to Willard was \\"at the time... a totally free Amazon server, and it was terrible,\\" which forced him to work under crunch time to quickly fix it. In August, InnerSloth opened a merch store for Among Us. The game's popularity inspired many fanarts and internet memes, as well as a phenomenon of \\"crewsonas\\"; Willard expressed that fan- created content \\"really is the best part\\" of making Among Us, with Bromander calling it \\"my favorite thing to see\\". The game popularized the slang word \\"sus\\" (meaning \\"suspicious\\"), though contrary to popular belief, the Among Us community did not invent the word, as it has been in use long before the game's release. During its time of widespread popularity, Among Us was controversially played by the U.S. Navy Esports team, in which players on the stream used in-game names referencing the N-word and the bombing of Nagasaki, deemed \\"offensive\\" and \\"intolerable\\" by some viewers. * U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar streamed the game in October 2020 alongside several other prominent streamers such as Pokimane and Hasan Piker as a way to encourage people to vote. In the midst of its popularity, InnerSloth considered releasing the game to consoles such as PS4 and Xbox One, but encountered a problem in implementing player communication, as standard text-based or voice-based chat seemed unusable. They considered a system similar to the \\"quick comms\\" system from Rocket League, as well as the possibility of developing an entirely new communication system for the game. As of September 2020, it is currently unknown what state the development of the ports is in, though they are at least considering making them. = Overhaul and cancelled sequel = In August 2020, the team shifted focus onto a sequel, Among Us 2. During this time, Forest Willard and Amy Liu continued to update Among Us, increasing the maximum playerbase, adding four servers, three regions, and longer game codes to allow for more concurrent games to be supported. On September 23, 2020, the team cancelled the sequel, instead opting to support the original game and add all content intended for the sequel to it instead, due to \\"how many people [were] enjoying [the original game]\\". As InnerSloth deemed the game's codebase \\"outdated and not built to support adding so much new content\\", the team plans to rework the game's core code to allow for the new features. Following this, the team announced their plans to fix the game's server issues and widespread cheating problem, as well as add a system for banning disruptive players, improve the gameplay of ghosts, add customizable controls, colorblind support, a friends system, more player colors, and a new map based on the Henry Stickmin series, of which Bromander is the creator. In October 2020, colorblind support for the \\"wires\\" task arrived to the Among Us beta on Steam, as well as some previously unannounced lobby customization options.  Reception  Associated Press noted the game was the most downloaded app on the iOS App Store for both iPhones and iPads in October 2020. Craig Pearson of Rock, Paper, Shotgun found playing as an Impostor \\"a lot more fun\\" than playing as a Crewmate, which he called \\"exhausting\\". In reference to the game's popularity among streamers, Evelyn Lau of The National said: \\"Watching the reactions of people trying to guess who the imposter is (and sometimes getting it very wrong) or lying terribly about not being the imposter is all quite entertaining.\\" Alice O'Conner of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as \\"Mafia or Werewolf but with minigames\\". Andrew Penney of TheGamer said the game was \\"worth it for the price\\" and that \\"who you play with dictates how fun the game is.\\" Among Us has been frequently compared to Fall Guys, as both became popular as party games during the COVID-19 pandemic; the developers of the games have both positively acknowledged each other on Twitter. Comparisons have also been drawn between the two games' avatars, which have been said to look like jelly beans. Among Us has also been compared to The Thing, Town of Salem, Werewolves Within, and Secret Hitler.

Geography  Buchenau lies in a valley on the northern edge of the Rh√∂n Mountains. The Eitra river, a tributary of the Haune, flows through the town. Three castles, a historical church and numerous half-timbered houses characterize the look of the area.  History  In 948 Buchenau was first mentioned in a document by Otto I as Buochon . In 1217 the name Buchenau first appeared as the seat of the noble family of the same name. The knighthood, which had reached its peak under Eberhard von Buchenau in the late middle ages, died in 1815 through the suicide of the 18-year-old Ludwig Karl von Buchenau in the male line. In 1572 the Spiegel Castle was built by Eberhard von Buchenau and in 1578 Conrad Hermann von Buchenau had the Seckendorff Castle built. Both castles are located together within a moat and a double wall and are known as the \\"Old Castle\\". From 1611 to 1618 the Buchenau Castle was built. The names of the three Buchenau castles in use today (Spiegel-Schloss, Seckendorff-Schloss and Schenck-Schloss) come from the former and current owners. Buchenau became protestant around 1555. When in 1629 the Fulda monastery abbot, Johann Bernhard Schenk zu Schweinsberg, wanted to reinstate the Catholic church constitution, the von Buchenau family protested and temporarily fled to Bad Hersfeld. As a result, Buchenau remained Protestant, although it was then again in the Catholic monastery area. = Territory Reform = On 1. August, 1972, the previously independent municipality of Buchenau, which also included the district Giesenhain, was incorporated into the municipality of Eiterfeld by state law as part of the territorial reform in Hesse. = The Buchenau Court = The ‚ÄûBuchenau Court‚Äú referred to the rule of the Lords of Buchenau. The court was under the rulership of the Fulda Abbey and included Buchenau, Bodes, Branders, Erdmannrode, Fischbach (Hauneck), Giesenhain and Soislieden.  Culture and Tourist Attractions  = Buildings = The protestant church of 1573 Aerial view of Schloss Buchenau The Generalshaus Seckendorffschloss Buchenau  Protestant Church  The protestant church was built by Eberhard von Buchenau between 1568 and 1573. It was designed as a single-nave church with a choir from 1820. The interior design dates from the 1800s and is equipped with three-sided, two-storey galleries. Two wooden reliefs from an altar shrine, several grave monuments in the choir from the 16th to 19th centuries and the organ from 1787 are notable.  Schloss Buchenau, also known as Schenckschloss  The Buchenau Castle is a two-wing castle built in the Weser Renaissance style. The castle was built between 1611 and 1618 by Georg Melchior von Buchenau (with wife Agnes von Schwalbach). The von Schenck zu Schweinsberg family acquired the castle in 1694 and lived there until 1912.  Generalshaus  The Generalshaus is a half-timbered house built in 1550 and was once the financial administration office for the Schenck Castle. The house was likely built by Georg von Buchenau (1535 to 1563) and his wife Susanne von Mansbach. A tower was built in 1904 as a copy of the tower on the Wartburg in Eisenach. The sandstone portal bears the Alliance coat of arms from Buchenau and from Schenck zu Schweinsberg. The Generalshaus is the main building in the 'Upper Castle' area. It got its name from a general of Schenck zu Schweinsberg.  Spiegelschloss  The Spiegelschloss is a two-wing lock building in the Renaissance style and is located right next to the Seckendorff lock. In order to stop the ongoing deterioration of the castle, structural measures are urgently required.  Seckendorffschloss  The castle was built and added to over several centuries and today offers a very mixed architectural style. The last large extension dates from the Renaissance period, but original construction is still clearly visible. To the east, a second tower was added to the existing building. Both towers are rectangular and were likely supplemented in 1578 by a stone/half-timbered building, thus giving their present appearance.

Penno (1843 ‚Äî 1929), known by his stage name William A. Huntley, was a composer, music teacher, and vocal and instrumental performer in minstrel and vaudeville traditions. Playing his 5-string banjo before crowds that came to number in the low thousands, he sang in a high tenor and played his banjo bare fingered, picking the strings in a style today named \\"classic banjo.\\" His published compositions include banjo instrumentals and parlor music. Huntley spent his working life performing and teaching in the off season. He performed throughout the United States and toured Europe as a part of several different minstrel groups. A highlight of his performing career was to play before the Prince and Princess of Wales, about 1880 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London. He moved away from minstrel shows by the 1880s, and \\"took pride\\" that he could perform without blackface stage makeup. He focused on building respectability for the banjo, through teaching, composition, and performance recitals. He was featured in the S. S. Stewart Company's catalog (showing that art-banjo promoter Stewart recognized his talent) and began to play the company's banjeaurine. In 1888 he performed before a crowd of 2,000 people in his hometown, Providence, Rhode Island. Career, minstrelsy to parlor music Huntley first performed onstage in a play in Providence at six- years-old. He played the part of \\"little Tom Bruce\\" in the play Nick of the Woods. His first minstrel engagement was in 1860 or 1862 with Mead's Euterpean Minstrels at New London, Connecticut. He worked as a clerk in Providence, recorded in the state census and city directory in 1865. Two biographies written during his lifetime are vague about the start of his musical career from 1865-1869; authors Edward Le Roy Rice and Samuel Swaim Stewart published generalized timelines of his activities. The two give different years for his work with Mead's Euterpean Minstrels. He was reported by Le Roy Rice to have joined the Campbell and Huntley Minstrels in 1865, and to have played with them for several years. However, news clippings indicate that group was formed in November 1870. Between 1868 and 1870 he was reported to have opened a music-teaching academy in Providence in which he gave banjo socials once a week, his \\"first attempt at edging the banjo into high society.\\" However, he was not listed in the Providence, Rhode Island city directory from 1866-1869. He re-appeared in the Providence city directory in 1870 both as William A. Penno, music teacher, and William A. Huntley, musician. Newspaper accounts in 1870 may be the earliest record of his music career. In October 1870, he became business partners with Charles Austin, John D. Hopkins and George W. Huntley to form Campbell, Huntley and Austin's minstrels, sharing profits. They became Campbell and Huntley's Minstrels in the midst of a November and December fallout between Austin and Hopkins in the newspapers. Originally planned to be together for four weeks, the group was still intact in January 1871. William A. Huntley began receiving his mail as a performer independent of Campbell and Huntley's Minstrels in February 1871. He and George (later \\"Dr. Geo. W.\\") Huntley continued to associate repeatedly into the 1880s. George Huntley became a successful manager and agent (organizing shows in towns ahead of the arrival of the minstrels), working with the Huntley Minstrels, the Martinetti-Ravel Pantomime Company and Whitmore and Clark's Minstrels.> By September, Huntley was performing on his own at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston, performing as a solo banjoist and making his first \\"whiteface\\" appearance on stage. William joined the Lauri English Pantomime Troupe by October 1871 and the Martinetti French Ravel Pantomime Company from December 1871-July 1872). In early 1873 he joined the McKee and Rogers Company, and afterwards rejoined the Martinetti Troupe. In 1874 he became co- partner with George W. Huntley again, in the management of Huntley's Minstrels, and performed in the principal theaters of the country for the next four years. Advertisement for Haverly‚Äôs Mastodon Minstrels in London 1880. Huntley was one of the 12 banjo experts. Huntley was especially engaged to play banjo for the blackface Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels in London, and led the group's big banjo act in which twelve performers appeared at one time. He gave a first performance at Her Majesty's Theatre on July 31, 1880 and remained three months. During this period, Huntley had the honor of appearing before the Royal Family. Afterward, he played in the principal cities of England and in Paris. He left Europe later in 1880 and arrived in Memphis, Tennessee on December 30, to fill out his contract with Mr. Haverly's \\"New Mastodon Minstrels.\\" From 1881 to 1884 Huntley performed with Whitmore and Clark's Minstrels, and later formed a partnership with John H. Lee. The two men opened a banjo teaching-studio in Providence and performed together, Lee on the 6-string banjo and Huntley on the banjeaurine. Lee left for California in June 1887, while Huntley continued to teach and perform. =Blackface vs. whiteface, a change of image= William A. Huntley, from S. S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal, Oct.‚ÄîNov. 1884. The minstrelsy show- business of the 1860s, when Huntley was breaking into his career, meant performing in blackface. However Huntley also engaged with performing groups that labeled themselves vaudeville and with pantomime groups. He performed his solo act in variety shows, where he had more control over how he presented himself. Huntley performed at Tony Pastor‚Äôs. Starting in the mid-1860s, impresario Tony Pastor capitalized on middle class sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature \\"polite\\" variety programs in his New York City theatres. Pastor used the term \\"vaudeville\\" in place of \\"variety\\" in early 1876,Armond Fields, Tony Pastor, Father of Vaudeville (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 2007), p. 84. hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic uptown by barring liquor in his theatres and bawdy material from his shows. Huntley had been experimenting with a different image from the early 1870s. He was characterized by minstrel Edward LeRoy Rice as having been successful performing in whiteface. It is not completely certain whether Rice meant his performances used white facepaint in the tradition of pantomime clowns, or if Huntley performed without any makeup at all. An 1884 news article made it likely he was performing without stage makeup. The reviewer said, \\"Mr. Wm. A. Huntley is the only banjo artist in the country that has ever made a success in white face.\\" Huntley was among the first to use the term classic banjo to describe his music. The phrase today means a style of playing the banjo bare fingered, picking out the notes with two fingers and a thumb. For Huntley, the term spoke of quality and he used it throughout the 1870s. Huntley became associated with Samuel Swaim Stewart, a banjo centered entrepreneur, and former blackface performer, who was trying to move the banjo toward greater respectability. Huntley was featured regularly in the S. S. Stewart Banjo and Guitar Journal, starting 1883, and Stewart published some of his music. Huntley took to the idea of a refined image for the banjo, and modified an idea used by J. H. Haverly and other large minstrel performance companies. Some of their advertising posters showed them marching in solidarity, in formal dress and in white face. However, their performers would perform in blackface, still formally dressed. Huntley would show up as himself, dressed in full evening dress, to perform that way even in rough places like the Bowery. From 1887-1893 he also performed at concerts organized by Fairbanks and Cole, high-end banjo manufacturers in competition with S. S. Stewart. Gallery File:William A. Huntley (left) and John H.

Huntley"},{"id":"65260808","text":"Watershed map showing Big Pipe, Little Pipe and Double Pipe Creek. A proposed Union Mills Reservoir represents a half century of efforts by the Commissioners of the Carroll County, Maryland, to build variations on a \\"dam\\" or \\"reservoir\\" near Union Mills, Maryland, on the Big Pipe Creek, defeated by a petition led by the Carroll County Taxpayers' Committee in the 1970s. The plan may be alive among some county officials but may also be postponed \\"indefinitely.\\" Land threatened by the reservoir includes the Whittaker Chambers Farm, also known as the Pipe Creek Farm, a National Historic Landmark as well as protected under the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF). Description According to a county report from the mid-1970s, the reservoir \\"will provide storage for sediment (1,125 acre-feet), flood control (6,414 acre-feet) municipal water supply (4,235 acre-feet) and recreation (1,210 acre-feet).\\" The reservoir would need 325 acres. As for 2014, Carroll County government's plan was to have a Union Mills Reservoir provide 3.76 million/gallons/day with a normal pool elevation of 610 feet. The reservoir would serve as regional source of water supply for Westminster, Hampstead, Taneytown, and Manchester. The Big Pipe Creek feeds into the Double Pipe Creek, which runs into the Monocacy River and on into the Chesapeake Bay. History According to a 2010 plan published by the community of Hampstead, Maryland: > Since 1970, the Carroll County Water and Sewerage Master Plan has included > the planned Union Mills Reservoir as a future water supply source to serve > Hampstead, as well as Manchester and Westminster. The County has purchased a > majority of the land needed for the reservoir. Community participants > emphasized the importance of making realistic and concrete the plans for > actually developing the reservoir as a water-supply resource that will > adequately serve the Hampstead and Manchester communities. =1970s= In the 1970s, Carroll County Commissioners made a first proposal for a dam or reservoir. In 1975, the Maryland Soil Conservation Service issued a draft plan for a Big Pipe Creek Watershed, whose purposes were \\"primarily for flood control\\" and \\"secondarily for water supply.\\" In February 1976, a \\"Carroll County Taxpayers' Committee\\" promised to oppose to the dam, Ted Lissauer announced, who also promised a public petition. In March 1976, the committee published an Opposition Statement to the Big Pipe Creek Watershed Plan. The committee also held a public informational meeting on the \\"Union Mills Dam controversy.\\" In June 1976, Carroll County Commissioners published a report called Big Pipe Creek Watershed: Plan and Environmental Impact Statement. In its first pages appeared a five-page \\"agreement\\" signed by the \\"chairman\\" of a \\"Carroll County Conservation District,\\" the president and secretary of the Carroll County Commissioners, a State Conservationist, and a \\"secretary\\" of the State of Maryland. It claimed to represent an agreement by the Carroll County Conservation District, the State of Maryland, and the United States Department of Agriculture (though no USDA official signed). The agreement would allow the Carroll County Commissioners to acquire land along the Big Pipe Creek for \\"improvements\\" to include a \\"multiple purpose reservoir and basic recreational facilities,\\" paid for by the county. The report appeared in an appendix in the Federal Register dated August 1976 under \\"environmental impact statements which were reviewed and not commented on between July 1 and 31, 1976.\\" The county's report included \\"only excerpts\\" from the Carroll County Taxpayers' Committee's opposition statement as 21 comments, followed by lengthy responses, all of which the country rejected or dismissed its responses. For example, when the committee complained that the costs of more than $6,000,000 hardly justified $16,000 in flood control benefits and thus had \\"no real flood control benefits,\\" the country responded that these costs \\"should not be compared.\\" (A full copy of the opposition statement went to the State Conservationist's Office, Soil Conservation Service, in College Park, Maryland). The Carroll County Taxpayers' Committee raised more than 5,000 signatures for its petition (as required by law) to stop the dam. On June 7, 1976, the Evening Sun of Hanover, Pennsylvania, asked, \\"Why is the Union Mills dam project like a Chinese nuzzle?\\" It answered, \\"Every time the pieces seem to fall into place, complicated new pieces appear.\\" It cited a new statement from Carroll County Taxpayer Committee spokesperson Ted Lissauer: \\"The county will take 860 acres of land in the Bachman Valley, of which up to 505 acres will be subject to flooding during rains. This destruction of federally regulated wetlands is excessive, considering the minimal flood protection provided downstream according to the Environmental Protection Agency-Philadelphia office.\\" =1980s= In August 1989, the Caroll County Times reporter that \\"If the Union Mills dam is ever built, there could be problems making the water fit to drink,\\" according to Carroll County government official, due to \\"fecal coliform bacteria levels.\\" The newspaper also recalled that in 1976 Carroll County Taxpayers Committee spokesperson Ted Lissauer had argued, \\"Carroll County had adequate groundwater.\\" =1990s= According to the Washington Examiner, \\"the process hit a wall in 1990, county Planning Director Steven Horn said, when it appeared that the Environmental Protection Agency would not approve plans, so the county withdrew its applications.\\" According to the newspaper, \\"federal officials were worried about the environmental effect of flooding acres of ecosystem.\\" Driving the push for new reservoirs is \\"unprecedented growth.\\" =2000s, 2010s, 2020s= In the 2000s, Carroll County officials renewed efforts to claim property for a dam along the Big Pipe Creek, including plans for a Union Mills reservoir. In 2005, Carroll County government made a \\"Reservoir Watershed Management Agreement of 2005,\\", first signed in 1979, between Baltimore City, Carroll County, Maryland Department of Environment, Maryland Department of Agriculture, Baltimore County Soil Conservation District, Carroll County Soil Conservation District, Baltimore Metropolitan Council, and a Reservoir Watershed Protection Committee. With regard to three existing water supply reservoirs\\" (Loch Raven, Liberty, and Prettyboy), all owned and operated by Baltimore City, the agreement's \\"most important goal of the agreement is to maintain high quality drinking water for metropolitan Baltimore including parts of Carroll, Baltimore, Howard and Anne Arundel counties and provide habitat and recreational uses.\\" In 2006, Carroll County government announced renewed intentions to build a \\"Union Mills reservoir, proposed north of Westminster, and the Gillis Falls reservoir, proposed for Mount Airy\\" by seeking approval from the Maryland Department of Planning. Affected residents expressed opposition, particularly concerned over proximity to a pollution from a John Owings landfill ‚Äî \\"a former dump that leaches chemicals.\\" In January 2007, according to a blog, Carroll Counter commissioners received letters from members of the United States Congress on behalf of the Whittaker Chambers Farm. In a letter dated January 7, 2007, Roscoe Bartlett wrote, \\"It is my hope that the Commissioners of Carroll County will value, even treasure, this very special farm, that you will do all in your power to keep it whole, and protect its integrity for this and future generations to study and know.\\" A letter dated January 12, 2007, came from twelve members of the United States Congress: Roscoe Bartlett, Wayne Gilchrest, Mario D√≠az-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Frank Wolf, Joe Wilson, Steve King, Madeleine Bordallo, Tom Feeney, John Boozman, Thaddeus McCotter, and Lincoln Diaz-Balart. The letter said, \\"We understand that the Carroll County Commissioners are considering a water plan that includes the creation of a Union Mills reservoir which, if completed, would destroy a significant portion of this national treasure.\\" On January 18th, 2007, Carroll Counter commissioners responded, \\"The need for a surface water supply for communities in northern Carroll County is real. We also believe that protecting and preserving nationally recognized sites of historic significance and irreplaceable farmland is equally important to our local, state and national well being. Our reservoir concept, with minimal impact to the Pipe Creek Farm, satisfies both of these fundamental principles of government: protecting our past while planning for our future.\\" In March 2007, the Baltimore Sun newspaper reported that the county was considering surface water options \\"including proposed reservoirs at Union Mills and Gillis Falls,\\" alternatives planned \\"since the 1970s.\\". The Sun also reported: > For the long term, Westminster is examining the county's revived plans for > two reservoirs, one at Union Mills and the other at Gillis Falls. But those > projects face significant federal hurdles, will take 10 years to complete > and cost at least $166 million to construct, county officials said. > \\"Water projects are going to be a major factor in our [community investment > plans] for some years to come,\\" Ted Zaleski, the county budget director, > said yesterday. > he federal Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency > discouraged Carroll's twin reservoir projects when they were first pressed > in the 1970s and 1980s. But with the state now pushing groundwater > restrictions, county officials are hopeful that dam projects may again > become feasible. > \\"It is the primary resource that is going to have to be there,\\" Ferguson > said of the Union Mills reservoir site. \\"We cannot continue to rely on > groundwater.\\" In June 2007, Whittaker Chambers' son objected to new efforts by the county. \\"This is where my parents died,\\" he told the Baltimore Sun. He had recently bought back that farmstead of the Whittaker Chambers Farm to reform the full farm. \\"My end-of-life goal has been to reassemble it and make it available to the next generation as a farm.\\" (In 1949, Whittaker Chambers told newspapers, \\"I am not selling my farm now, and I have no intention of doing so. I expect to live here the rest of my life.\\" ) During a public hearing on March 9, 2010, the County heard commentson a draft water resources element (WRE) from the members of the public, who argued: # Carroll County has sufficient water now and in future without a reservoir # Proximity of the John Owings landfill raises questions about contamination of a reservoir # No one from Carroll County government had discussed the proposed reservoir or its affects, e.g., flooding # 21 communities as water/sewer problem areas since the 1990s went unmentioned in the WRE # Piney Run did not appear in the WRE as an alternative for future drinking water supply # The US Army Corps of Engineers had already advised against a Gillis Falls Reservoir # Carroll County government should stop the 35% general leaks in municipal systems before considering any new sources # Carroll County government should ask for some funds to restore the Chesapeake Bay to restore the Bear Branch of the Big Pipe Creek Tom Devilbiss, deputy director of Carroll County's Department of Planning, stated that planning commissions would review comments and make changes to the draft as they saw fit without further requirement fr public hearing. As of December 2010, Carroll County government had 65% of property (land) for its proposed Union Mills Reservoir (and 83% for the proposed Gillis Fall Reservoir). In 2012, Carroll County government officials made statements about the Union Mills reservoir project. Tom Rio, director of public works for Carroll County, stated that fresh water supplies were \\"limited\\" in the county, thus the county's plans for the Union Mills reservoir. Therefore, the county purchased two houses that the reservoir would \\"directly\\" impact. Then, Rio admitted, \\"The properties wouldn't exactly be under water if the project gets under way.\\" However, Tom Devilbiss, deputy director of the county's Department of Land Use, Planning and Development, stated \\"the likelihood of either of the reservoirs being constructed is questionable.\\" He explained that the county was only in \\"initial stages\\" of searching for groundwater at the properties purchased. The county spent $179,000 for two houses with 32.1 acres associated with the Union Mills Reservoir project. Devilbiss estimated another 20 years, \\"if ever,\\" until the building of a Union Mills Reservoir. In 2014, a water and sewage master plan for Carroll County referred a Union Mills Reservoir \\"impoundment\\" for \\"long-term water supply needs.\\" It also recommended for the long-term that the county main \\"long term water source options\\" at the proposed Union Mills Reservoir as well as a \\"York PA Water System,\\" as well as \\"non-groundwater water supply.\\" It intends the proposed reservoir for as \\"regional source of supply for Westminster, Hampstead, Taneytown, and Manchester Service Areas.\\" In December 2016, the Global Liberty Alliance Fund, to defend private property rights, started investigating Carroll County government's efforts on behalf of the Whittaker Chambers Farm. The Fund helped organize affected landowners and concerned citizens in contacting Members of Congress and other community leaders to help stop the reservoir. According to the Fund, Carroll County government \\"threatened\\" to confiscate property under eminent domain ‚Äì \\"despite the fact that federal law regarding National Historic Landmarks states that the land must be preserved.\\" The Fund claims that \\"16 Members of Congress also weighed in as well as and historians from several universities and academic institutions.\\" In conclusion, the Fund reported that \\"Carroll County decided to postpone indefinitely the development of the Union Mills Reservoir\\" and \\"indicated... they are no longer interested in the reservoir project.\\" In 2017, Carroll County government published the statement: \\"From FY 1980 through FY 2017, 70,311 acres were permanently preserved through easement programs, which is roughly 1/4 of the total county land area,\\", including Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF). A map that appears on the same page depicts a majority of land not already purchased by the county for the proposed reservoir as permanently protected under MALPF. Fecal bacteria Carroll County studies reveal a rising rate of fecal bacteria (here, Escherichia coli) in Carroll County waterways Investigations, led by the Maryland Department of Environment and published in 2007 and 2009, into fecal bacteria in the Big Pipe Creek have shown significant increase. Major contributors to increased fecal bacteria are humans and domestic animals (pets), while potential to reduce fecal bacteria by more than 55% could be achieved also by humans and domestic animals (pets). The 2007 report mentions \\"pet waste\\" and mention \\"community and homeowner associations\\" as responsible for policies and campaigns to address pet waste. The MDE's 2009 report stated that \\"Multiple antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) source tracking was used to determine the relative proportion of domestic (pets and human associated animals), human (human waste), livestock (agriculture-related animals), and wildlife (mammals and waterfowl) source categories.\\" The report found that fecal bacteria could be reduced in a practicable manner by 95% among humans and 75% among domestic animals (pets), caused by 12/2% of land usage described as \\"urban\\" (humans, pets). The pores notes, \\"Nonpoint source contributions from human activities generally arise from failing septic systems and their associated drain fields or leaking infrastructure (i.e., sewer systems).\\" The report also notes \\"uncertainty\\" about the efficacy of \\"pet waste education programs.\\" In 2008, the Center for Watershed Protection, Inc.; Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, and Home Builders Association of Maryland issued a Recommended Model Development Principles, submitted to the Carroll County government, \\"fostering more environmentally- sensitive site development in Carroll County,\\" while conceding that \\"Deciding where to allow or encourage development and protect natural resources is a difficult issue that jurisdictions have to balance.\\" The reported targeted an audience of four: local government (Carroll County), residential homeowners, land developers, environment (but no land owners including farmers). Numerous tables depicted every box checked to show due diligence for anti-degradation, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), the 2005 watershed agreement, the 2007 Stormwater Management Act (HB 786), Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), and Water Resources Element Law. The report then summarizes, \\"Through the Roundtable process, Carroll County is taking an important step towards improving local water quality and quality of life for citizens (although the only \\"citizens\\" targeted as an audience are \\"homeowners\\".) All land-related images in the document depict single homes and no farmland. The Center for Watershed Protection has recommended the model. By 2010, Carroll County government issued a 265-page Water Resources Element report that added another new purpose for the reservoir, namely income generator via export of water: > There are six existing or planned water supply reservoirs whose watersheds > extend partially or entirely within Carroll County: Loch Raven, Prettyboy, > Liberty, Piney Run, Gillis Falls, and Union Mills. Combined, these existing > and planned reservoirs could potentially provide high-quality water for > nearly 2 million people in Baltimore City and the five surrounding counties. Four reservoirs already exist. Loch Raven, built in 1914, has a water capacity of 23 billion gallons. Prettyboy, completed in 1932, has a 19 billion water capacity. Liberty, completed 1956, has a 43 billion gallon water capacity. Piney Run, completed 1974, has a 2 billion gallon water capacity. Loch Raven and Prettyboy both lie in Baltimore County. Although Liberty lies between Baltimore and Carroll counties, City of Baltimore Department of Public Works owns it. Piney Run lies inside Carroll County. The proposed Gillis Falls and Union Mills reservoirs also lie within Carroll County, thus fall under control of Carroll County commissioners. Additionally, the report states \\"Most of the watersheds for these reservoirs are on the State‚Äôs list of 'impaired' waters\\" and adds: > Failing septic systems are a high-priority target for both nutrient > reduction and protection of public health.

The report recommends specific actions, including: \\"Incorporate the county‚Äôs open space and land preservation program measures,\\" \\"Require watershed and wellhead protection,\\" \\"Identify existing older water pipes in need of repair or replacement and program improvements,\\" and \\"Annually locate and repair leaks in distribution system; all meters replaced a couple years ago; perform quarterly water loss audits; water loss currently 10-12 percent.\\" Union Mills Wetlands Just west of Maryland Route 97 \\"Littlestown Pike\\" next to Union Mills, Maryland, is an as-yet unofficial \\"Union Mills Wetlands,\\" where eight or more streams converge with the Big Pipe Creek, which several nature groups recognize, including Carroll County Bird Club, eBird, and Birds & Blooms. Another wetlands exists along the Little Pipe Creek, near Union Bridge, Maryland, also in Carroll County, less than fifteen miles from the Union Mills Wetlands. According to Carroll County government, \\"Water Resource Management largely focuses on the protection of streams, ponds, and wetlands through the implementation of buffers and easements.\\" In 2015, Carroll County government announced: > In May of 2012, the Watershed Protection and Restoration Act of 2012 (HB > 987) became law. The Bill requires Maryland‚Äôs 10 most populous > jurisdictions, including Carroll County, to collect a Stormwater Remediation > Fee to fund the implementation of local stormwater management practices, and > stream and wetland restoration projects. The law‚Äôs intent is to assist > counties in funding stormwater management in conformance with the > Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs mandated National Pollutant Discharge > Elimination System (NPDES) Permit. In August 2017, Carroll County government stated that one of its top three \\"environmental principles\\" was to \\"maintain safe and adequate drinking water and other water supplies including efforts to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay.\\" In the same document, rather than protect and restore the Chesapeake, the county emphasized (land) development in its third environmental goal (\\"protect and enhance the water quality of Carroll County‚Äôs rivers, streams, reservoirs, and aquifers; comply with applicable state and federal requirements related to water quality and quantity; and maintain and protect adequate water supplies to serve current and planned development\\"). In May 2020, the Center for Watershed Protection noted that a pilot study of the Airpark Business Center in Carroll County, Maryland, showed the \\"most noticeable response\\" to best management practices (BMPs) among three watersheds studied. =Bird watching= Birdwatchers in the area have seen many species including Maryland's official state bird, the Baltimore oriole. The Carroll County Bird Club recommends Union Mills wetlands as an excellent environment in which to spot species such as the ruby-throated hummingbird, great blue heron, green heron, eastern kingbird, great egret, barred owl, red- headed woodpecker, downy woodpecker, red-bellied woodpecker, red-tailed hawk, wood duck, northern flicker, fish crow, eastern towhee, sora, swamp sparrow, yellow warbler, solitary sandpiper, indigo bunting, eastern bluebird, orchard oriole, and Baltimore oriole. Maps An August 2003 \\"Stream Use & Drainage Basin Designation\\" map shows the creek and streams as part of the Double Pipe Creek drainage basin designation, including the Whittaker Chambers Farm. As an example, an October 2004 \\"Draft Water Resource Management Area Guidance Map\\" shows \\"proposed reservoir pool\\" along the edges of much of the Whittaker Chambers Farm, as well as \\"Surface Water Management Zone\\" that encroaches deeply into the farm, including road access. On September 22, 2010, Carroll County government published a map called \\"Union Mills Reservoir Trails\\" referring to the unbuilt Union Mills Reservoir. A 2014 county master plan map, adopted as \\"Plan Resolution #938-2015 on February 26, 2015,\\" shows a reservoir project that would surround and encroach, for example, on much of the Whittaker Chambers Farm. A second 2014 county master plan map shows a much larger reservoir area, e.g., showing not partial but majority use of the Whittaker Chambers Farm for either under water for \\"reservoir\\" or seized for \\"resource conservation.\\" Another county map dated June 22, 2017, which \\"shows easements acquired as of 6/30/2017.\\" For example, while it depicts the Whittaker Farm as under Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MAPLF) easement, it also shows that farm's center (\\"Medfield\\") circled in yellow as \\"designated/municipal growth area.\\" A 2020 county zoning map shows many to-be-affected farms under either conservation or agriculture. Carroll County Tourism refers to a \\"Union Mills Reservoir\\" Area which other tourism sites have started to use in reference to hiking and horseback riding. Some websites have only referred to a \\"Union Mills\\" trail. In 2020, several websites amended misleading titles from \\"Union Mills Reservoir\\" to \\"Union Mills Area\\" or \\"Union Mills Trail.\\" See also * Eminent domain * Carroll County, Maryland * Loch Raven Reservoir * Prettyboy Reservoir * Liberty Reservoir * Piney Run Reservoir * Union Mills, Maryland * Westminster, Maryland * Hampstead, Maryland * Manchester, Maryland * New Windsor, Maryland * Taneytown, Maryland * Union Bridge, Maryland * Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve * Chesapeake Bay Program References External links * F-SC8-D36016-MD Big Pipe Creek Watershed: Plan and Environmental Impact Statement * Federal Register of August 26, 1976 Category:Chesapeake Bay watershed Category:Protected areas of Carroll County, Maryland Category:Bodies of water of Carroll County, Maryland Category:Monocacy River Category:Westminster, Maryland Category:Land use ","title":"Union Mills Reservoir"},{"id":"65260838","text":"Zolile Monakali is a South African educator and politician who has served as the Northern Cape MEC for Education since 16 September 2020.

In 1943, Billboard magazine published a chart ranking the \\"most popular records in Harlem\\" under the title of the Harlem Hit Parade. Placings were based on a survey of record stores primarily in the Harlem district of New York City, an area noted for its African American population and regarded as the \\"black capital of America\\". The chart is considered to be the start of the lineage of the magazine's R&B; chart, which as of 2020 is published under the title Hot R&B;/Hip Hop Songs. Most of 1943's number ones were in the jazz and swing genres, which were among the most popular styles of music in the early 1940s. The year's longest-running chart-topper was \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" by Erskine Hawkins and his Orchestra, which spent a total of 14 non-consecutive weeks atop the chart between August and December. Two acts each achieved the feat of topping the chart with three different songs. Lucky Millinder and his Orchestra topped the listing with \\"When the Lights Go on Again\\", \\"Apollo Jump\\" and \\"Sweet Slumber\\", which was the final number one of 1943. Duke Ellington and his Famous Orchestra reached the top spot with \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\", \\"A Slip of the Lip (Can Sink a Ship)\\" and \\"Sentimental Lady\\". The latter two songs were the two sides of the same record, but Billboard listed each in the number-one position for one week. Ellington's recording of \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" was one of two versions of the song to top the chart during 1943; the Ink Spots also reached number one with a vocal version of the track. Ellington had originally composed and recorded the track in 1940 as an instrumental with the title \\"Never No Lament\\", but it was re-titled and re- released after other artists recorded it with the addition of lyrics written by Bob Russell. The King Cole Trio had two number ones in 1943, the first chart success for pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole, who would move on from the jazz field to become a hugely successful pop artist. Three of 1943's number ones had sufficient crossover appeal to also top Billboards overall National Best Selling Retail Records chart, the forerunner of the modern Hot 100. The first was the year's first chart-topper, \\"White Christmas\\" by Bing Crosby with the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter and his Orchestra, which has remained a perennial favourite for more than 70 years and has been acclaimed by Guinness World Records as the world's best-selling single, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide. Later in the year, \\"I've Heard That Song Before\\" by Harry James and his Orchestra and \\"You'll Never Know\\" by Dick Haymes and the Song Spinners topped both listings. \\"You'll Never Know\\" was among a number of records released with a choral backing because the 1942‚Äì1944 musicians' strike prevented union musicians from making commercial recordings. Chart history Vocal group the Ink Spots had two number ones in 1943. Lucky Millinder led his orchestra to three chart-toppers. Ella Mae Morse topped the chart in December with \\"ShooShoo Baby\\". \\"I've Heard That Song Before\\" was a number one for Harry James and his Orchestra. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=colIssue date !scope=colTitle !scope=colArtist(s) !scope=col class=unsortableRef. - !scope=row \\"White Christmas\\"  with the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row \\"When the Lights Go on Again\\"  and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row  \\"See See Rider Blues\\"  align=center - !scope=row  \\"What's the Use of Getting Sober (When You Gonna Get Drunk Again)\\"  and his Tympany Five align=center - !scope=row  \\"That Ain't Right\\"  align=center - !scope=row \\"See See Rider Blues\\"  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=2 \\"Apollo Jump\\" rowspan=2 and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row \\"See See Rider Blues\\"  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=3 \\"Don't Stop Now\\" rowspan=3 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\"  align=center - !scope=row rowspan=2 \\"Don't Stop Now\\" rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  \\"I've Heard That Song Before\\"  Harry James and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row rowspan=2 \\"I Can't Stand Losing You\\" rowspan=4 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" align=center - !scope=row \\"I Can't Stand Losing You\\" align=center - !scope=row \\"See See Rider\\"  align=center - !scope=row  \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\"  and his Famous Orchestra align=center - !scope=row \\"I Can't Stand Losing You\\"  align=center - !scope=row \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\"  and his Famous Orchestra align=center - !scope=row rowspan=3\\"I Can't Stand Losing You\\" rowspan=3 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\"  and his Famous Orchestra align=center - !scope=row rowspan=4 \\"You'll Never Know\\" rowspan=4 and the Song Spinners align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row rowspan=6 \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" rowspan=6 and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  \\"\\" rowspan=2 and his Famous Orchestra align=center - !scope=row  \\"Sentimental Lady\\" align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=6 \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" rowspan=6 and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  \\"All for You\\"  align=center - !scope=row  \\"Don't Cry Baby\\"  and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row \\"All for You\\"  align=center - !scope=row \\"Don't Cry Baby\\"  and his Orchestra align=center - !scope=row  \\"ShooShoo Baby\\"  align=center - !scope=row  \\"Sweet Slumber\\"  and His Orchestra align=center } References 1943 Category:1943 record charts Category:1943 in American music ","title":"List of Harlem Hit Parade number ones of 1943"},{"id":"65260845","text":"The following are notable people who were either born, raised or have lived for a significant period of time in Peja.

The dancer Jane Avril peruses a print P√®re Cotelle has just run off. L'Estampe originale was a French periodical publishing portfolios of original prints in a limited edition of 100 for subscribers. It produced nine issues quarterly between 1893 and 1895, containing a total of 95 original prints by a very distinguished group of 74 artists,VG; Stein, 8‚Äì9 including Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, Renoir, Pissarro, Whistler, Paul Signac, Odilon Redon, Rodin, Henri Fantin-Latour, Felix Bracquemond, F√©licien Rops and Puvis de Chavannes. Almost all of Les Nabis contributed: Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, √âdouard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, F√©lix Vallotton, and Paul S√©rusier. British artists included William Nicholson, Charles Ricketts, Walter Crane and William Rothenstein; besides Whistler, Joseph Pennell was the only American.Stein, 20‚Äì40 has a catalogue in alphabetic order Maxime Maufra, The Road from Gaud (La Route de Gaud), lithograph in 4 colours, 1893 Commentators at the time and subsequently have unanimously praised the success of the publisher, Andr√© Marty, in collecting a stellar group of artists, and in many cases getting them to produce some of their finest prints. Together the group display the main currents in the diverse and vibrant Parisian art scene of the period. After the Etching Revival beginning in the 1850s, France saw another wave of productivity in printmaking in the 1890s, with a great variety of techniques, subjects, and styles.Stein, 6‚Äì7; Salsbury; VG L'Estampe originale has a notably large number of figure subjects compared with typical prints from earlier decades, but there are many landscapes and city views, traditional in style and not, and a wide range of other subjects. The rising influence of Art Nouveau is very apparent, but the more traditional styles of the Etching Revival are also well-represented. There is a great variety of printmaking techniques used, some of which would only have been possible in a relatively small edition of 100.Stein, 10‚Äì13; Salsbury; VG Of the prints, 60 were lithographs, 26 in the various intaglio techniques (with a third of these using colour), 7 woodcuts, a wood engraving and a gypsograph. A striking common factor is the high proportion using colour, in many different techniques, not just the lithographs.Stein, 6‚Äì9; VG F√©lix Vallotton, La Manifestation (\\"The Demonstration\\"), woodcut, 1893 Each issue was printed in only 100 impressions.Stein, 4, The first eight issues each had ten loose prints in a paper cover or wrapper; the last was entitled Album de cl√¥ture (\\"Closing album\\") and the fourteen prints were between two paper-covered boards secured by two cream satin ribbons.Stein, 6‚Äì7 This was apparently intended to now hold all the previous issues as well,Stein, 13 and the title included a pun on \\"closure\\". Many buyers removed prints from the album to frame and hang, as had been anticipated. The prints were nearly all newly created for L'Estampe originale, had different sizes, and were often printed on different papers; indeed not all were by the same printer. They were signed and numbered, and the margins embossed with a small blind stamp, common to all the series.Stein, 6‚Äì7; Salsbury History =First incarnation= The title L'Estampe originale had an earlier life, under different direction but in a similar format and with some of the same artists, in 1888 and 1889.Stein, 7 Three issues were published, the first of ten prints in 150 copies, costing 100 francs. The six or more artists contributing to the first issue included four who also made prints for the revived publication: Bracquemond, Henri Boutet, Henri-Patrice Dillon and Auguste-Louis Lep√®re, and the other issues, about which much is obscure, also used artists who appeared in the revived title.Baas, throughout, especially 19‚Äì21; Stein, 7‚Äì8 Lep√®re appears to have been a key figure in organizing the title.Baas, 17 When Jacquelynn Baas was writing her article in 1983, no complete set of the early issues from the 1880s was apparently known to survive in any museum, and a note reported with some excitement that another print scholar \\"had recently seen a copy of the first issue\\" in a French private collection.Baas, 13, \\"Author's note\\"; Stein, 7‚Äì8 The title as revived under Marty was \\"better-organized, better-known, and, it must be admitted, higher-quality\\", not to mention better value.Baas, 20 Unless stated otherwise, references to the title in this article refer to Marty's issues. All the prints in the early three issues were monochrome; the large number of images in colour, using a variety of techniques, is a striking feature of the revived issues.VG; Baas, 17 Camille Martin, cover for L'Estampe Originale issue 5, celebrating the second year, colour lithograph, 1894 L'Estampe originale is also not to be confused with the similar but much cheaper L'Estampe Moderne, which also had two incarnations, the first of three issues in 1894‚Äì1895, and the more successful second of 24 issues in 1897‚Äì1899. These were all lithographs in a much larger print run, leaning more to Art Nouveau.Adventures in the Print Trade =Second incarnation= The revived L'Estampe originale was published by the otherwise obscure, but evidently well-connected, figure of Andr√© Marty, about whom little is known. He published a number of books, mostly on history, but including one on printmaking in 1906, and became director of the weekly Journal des Artistes (of 17, Rue de Rome) in 1893, but left in 1894, taking L'Estampe originale with him. Marty bought the rights to use the title from the publishers of the 1888 project.Stein, 8, 14, where note 14 lists Marty's other titles. None of the internal documentation of the enterprise is known to have survived, leaving much unclear for scholars. Apart from the nine portfolios, the only other activity of the L'Estampe originale imprint was in 1893, as publisher of Le Caf√©-concert, a book by Georges Montorgueil illustrated with lithographs (all in black apart from the lettering on the cover) by Toulouse-Lautrec and Henri-Gabriel Ibels, who both contributed to L'Estampe originale.Stein, 8; See Caf√©-chantant for the style of venue. The blind stamp used on every print, Alexandre Charpentier A short prospectus for the revived L'Estampe originale was published early in 1893, beginning \\"... the Journal des Artistes will publish ...\\".Stein, 17 is a translation This explained the contents of the album, and listed 51 artists who had promised works; all but six, and these minor figures, later contributed. An \\"accompanying text\\" by the critic and arts civil servant Roger Marx was promised, and his \\"Preface\\" of some two pages did eventually appear in the sixth volume, effectively the only text in the project other than lists of the prints.Stein, 7, 9 The first album was promised for 30 March 1893; the initial subscription price was 150 francs for a year, for four issues with ten prints each. The price to later buyers would be 200 francs.Stein, 7, 17 This represented far better value for subscribers than the earlier issues of 1888/89.Baas, 20 The price of the final issue, outside the annual subscription, and with more prints in the single issue, as well as the board covers, is not known.Stein, 7 It is not known if the subscription offer sold out, but by 1898 it was reported that a complete set cost 600 francs, presumably on the art market rather than from the publishers.Stein, 8 The project was probably always intended to be short- lived; a letter from Camille Pissarro to his son Lucien Pissarro (both contributors) dated 28 January 1894 referred to a lithograph he had already completed for \\"the last number of Marty's portfolio\\", which was not to be published for over a year. This indicates the degree of forward planning Marty used.Stein, 13 Count of prints The 95 entries in the Stein and Karshan catalogue are made up as follows:Stein, 20‚Äì40 * Eight issues of ten prints each, giving 80 (including two paper covers, for issues I and V) * Issue IX with fourteen prints (including a paper cover) *The blind stamp, sometimes cut from the margin and mounted separately by collectors (Cat. 15). Designed by Alexandre Charpentier, who also had a lithograph in album VII, it shows a half-length nude woman seen from behind, with the title, set in a octagonal frame. It is just under two inches in each dimension, and is usually placed near a corner of the lower margin, where there is room, or in a quiet area within the composition.Stein, 7, 11, 23. Stein's catalogue notes the location for each print. A small decorative woodcut by George Auriol, printed with the Preface in issue VI (Cat. 3) is counted as one of the prints.Stein, 7, 20 File:Charles Maurin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1890, NGA 33845.jpgCharles Maurin, Portrait of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1890, aquatint printed in brown File:Georges Auriol - Trembling Woods - 1995.224 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tifGeorge Auriol, Trembling Woods (Bois Frissonants), 1893, colour lithograph File:Eug√®ne Grasset - La Vitrioleuse.jpgEug√®ne Grasset, La Vitrioleuse (\\"The Acid Thrower\\") 1894, lithograph with hand-stencilled colours.Translated as The Vitriol Thrower by Stein, but \\"oil of vitriol\\" as a name for sulphuric acid is very obselete, and likely to confuse.

He was involved in restoration of Mughal monuments including the Taj Mahal; designed several buildings in India including Christ Church in Shimla and St George's Church in Agra; and established a magnetic observatory at Shimla.  Life and work  Boileau as a cadet, c. 1821 Boileau was born in Calcutta. His father Thomas Boileau had moved to India in 1780 to work at the Supreme Court in Fort William. On his father's side his ancestors were Huguenots from N√Æmes. His mother Leah was the daughter of Lt. Col. Ebenezer Jessup from New England. After the death of the father in 1806, the family moved to live in Bury St. Edmunds, England. After studying at the Grammar School, he received a cadetship at the East India Company Military Seminary at Addiscombe in 1819. His brother Henry joined in the next year. He received prizes in mathematics and Hindustani and was gazetted in 1821 and sent for training to Chatham with the Royal Engineers. He reached Calcutta on 22 September 1822 and then on to Kanpur. He was involved in road building at Jabalpur and between Nagpur and Kamptee. In 1826 he became garrison engineer at Agra, designing the St George Church, the jail, a college, and barracks. In 1829 he married Ann, daughter of Captain Hanson, and on the same day, his brother Henry married Ann's sister at St George's Church. Boileau was involved in reconstruction and repair of several Mughal constructions including Jahangir's palace, Fatehpur, and the Taj Mahal. The cost exceeded the estimates and when he wished to leave the East India Company on furlough in 1834, he was asked to pay thirty thousand rupees as outstanding expenses. In 1839, Boileau was assigned to set up a magnetic observatory at Simla after being trained by Professor Humphrey Lloyd of Trinity College, Dublin. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 5 March 1840 and later to the Royal Astronomical Society. While at Simla, he also designed the Christ Church and raised funds for its construction. In 1847 he became superintending engineer in the North West Provinces. He then moved to live at Ambala where weekend dinners included flute played by Boileau and piano by his wife Ann. He retired on 4 February 1856 with the rank of Major General, just before the mutiny. The family settled at Notting Hill and he began to work for the wives, widows, and children of soldiers then posted in large numbers in the Crimea. In 1860 he joined the 1st Middlesex Rifle volunteers. Punch magazine depicted a cartoon of him as \\"Mr Buffles\\" in 1862. A bust by Thomas Brock is now in the Kensington public library.

While the series was in development, it went through three producers before finally settling on Josef Shaftel ‚Äî the fourth person to take the job ‚Äî as the series producer. Originally, the show was to have the title The Racers and include exciting racing sequences, and its original sponsor, the spark plug manufacturer Autolite, approved of the show‚Ä≤s racing focus. During the summer of 1961, however, the Ford Motor Company bought Autolite. Ford wished to emphasize the safety of automobiles for family use, an image of cars obviously lacking in auto racing scenes. Before the show premiered, and at the insistence of Ford, the show was retitled Straightaway, the ten episodes that Racer Productions had already filmed before Ford became involved had to be reedited to delete their racing sequences, and later episodes had to deemphasize the show's original focus on racing. Co-star John Ashley in real life was a rockabilly performer, and his character Clipper Hamilton occasionally sang during episodes of Straightaway. Maynard Ferguson composed the theme music for Straightaway, and his 1961 album \\"Straightaway\\" Jazz Themes contains music he composed for the television series.

CBS cancelled it after only one season, and its last original episode aired on April 4, 1962.

In August 2011, Dosqaliev was sentenced 7 years to prison after corruption scandal where he was reported taking bribes and embezzling budget funds. He was eventually pardoned by President Nursultan Nazarbayev and was released on 16 March 2012.  Biography  = Early life and career = Dosqaliev was born in the town of Alga of Aktobe Region. In 1979, he graduated from the Aktobe Medical Institute, specializing as a medical doctor.

Corruption scandal and imprisonment  On 21 September 2010, Dosqaliev, during his visit to North Kazakhstan Region, arranged an unscheduled check on his subordinates and was dissatisfied with their knowledge. That same day, the financial police opened a criminal cause against Dosqaliev for abuse of office. On 25 September 2010, Dosqaliev was detained by the employees of the financial police of Kazakhstan, but a day earlier his health condition deteriorated and he ended up in the National Scientific Medical Center. The leadership of the Scientific Center, where the minister is located, stated that Dosqaliev was in an extremely serious condition which was in a coma. However, the financial police showed a video recording of the head of the Minister talking with doctors and at the same time actively gesturing. As a result, the investigators managed to prove that the Dosqaliev faked a stroke, and the doctors of the Scientific Center admitted that they had given false testimony about his condition. Dosqaliev was accused of abuse of power and abuse of office, receiving a bribe on an especially large scale and embezzling budget funds. In particular, the investigation established that Dosqaliev received six more apartments as a bribe. He registered one of them for his close relative, and sold the other five. On the night of 2 and 3 October 2010, the Saryarqa District Court of Astana gave an arrest warrant. On 7 October 2010, by the Decree of the President of Kazakhstan, Dosqaliev was relieved from his post.

She was also an important impresario. Early years Am√©lia Rey Cola√ßo was born on 2 March 1898 in Lisbon, Portugal, the youngest of four sisters. She came from a privileged, artistic and multinational background. Her father, Alexandre Rey Cola√ßo, born in Tangier in 1854, had a Portuguese mother and a French father. Orphaned at a young age, his training as a pianist started at the Madrid Royal Conservatory and was continued in Paris and Berlin, as a result of the patronage of the Count of Daupi√°s. As a pianist and composer, he became music teacher to Prince Lu√≠s Filipe of Portugal and his brother, the future King Manuel II. Am√©lia Rey Cola√ßo‚Äôs mother, Alice Lafourcade Schmidt, was born in Chile, had a French mother and a German father and taught her daughters several languages. She grew up in Berlin with her mother and stepfather, a musical instrument dealer. Schmidt‚Äôs mother became known in Berlin for organizing a salon where she gathered promising figures from the artistic world. It was at this salon that Schmidt met Alexandre Rey Cola√ßo. In December 1911, Am√©lia Rey Cola√ßo visited Berlin with her sister, Maria, with the aim of studying music. Here, she also found a stimulating environment at her grandmother's salon. She also had the opportunity to attend shows directed by Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater, and it is said that this attracted her to acting. On her return to Portugal she started to take acting lessons with the actor, Augusto Rosa, with whom her father was good friends. In 1915, she and her sisters went to Madrid where they recited before King Alfonso XIII and his court. This familiarised her with performing in public at the highest level. Acting debut and early career Following a recommendation by Augusto Rosa, Rey Cola√ßo‚Äôs acting debut occurred in 1917 at the then Teatro Rep√∫blica (now Teatro S√£o Luiz) in Lisbon, in the play Marinela by the Spanish author and playwright, Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s. To play the character, a young vagabond, she practised for months walking barefoot and wearing rags, inside the garden of her family home. On stage with two of Portugal‚Äôs best-known actors, Palmira Bastos and Adelina Abranches, her performance received widespread enthusiasm in most of the Lisbon press. She stayed at the Teatro S√£o Luiz until 1919, refusing invitations to join Spanish companies. She was then hired for the summer season of the D. Maria II National Theatre. In 1920 she married the actor and director, Felisberto Robles Monteiro. They founded their own theatre company, known as the Companhia Rey Cola√ßo-Robles Monteiro. This company was to last 53 years, mainly playing in the National Theatre, for which the company won the concession in 1929. In addition to performances in Lisbon the company also toured to other parts of the country, including its islands. Rey Cola√ßo-Robles Monteiro theatre company The new theatre company‚Äôs first play was Zilda by the playwright Alfredo Cortez. Zilda, played by Rey Cola√ßo, is a girl who prostitutes herself to move up in life. She has been said to have embodied the first modern character in Portuguese theatre. Rey Cola√ßo organized an ambitious repertoire, in spite of censorship applied by the Estado Novo government. The company was noted for its scenography: she called on famous artists to help design the scenery, including the architect Raul Lino, the artist and choreographer, Jos√© de Almada Negreiros, and the painter Eduardo Malta. As actors, her company hired some of the most famous names of the time in Portugal, such as Palmira Bastos, Laura Alves, and Vasco Santana. She introduced an entire new generation of actors and directors who were trained by the company, such as Jo√£o Villaret, Maria Barroso, Ruy de Carvalho and Filipe La F√©ria. With the company‚Äôs repertoire alternating between classical and modern works, she opened the doors to Portuguese dramatists, presenting works by Jos√© R√©gio and Bernardo Santareno, among others. At the same time she introduced foreign playwrights to the Portuguese audience, such as Jean Cocteau, Jean Anouilh, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n, Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Pirandello, Max Frisch, Ionesco, and Edward Albee. Her task was greatly hampered by state censorship, which constantly prevented new projects and interrupted presentations. The company's wide repertoire was almost entirely due to Rey Colaco‚Äôs persistence and great diplomatic capacity, but not even she could persuade the censors to let the company play Lu√≠s de Sttau Monteiro or Berthold Brecht. The death of her husband in 1958 was a severe blow to Rey Cola√ßo, both personally and professionally. She assumed the company‚Äôs administrative responsibilities hitherto performed by her husband and began to share the direction of the company with her daughter, Mariana. Her work as an actress took second place and the economic difficulties experienced by the company, a consequence of the complicated contractual conditions imposed by the National Theatre, led to several requests for government subsidies. The company's situation was dramatically affected by a fire that broke out at the National Theater on December 2, 1964 during a performance of Macbeth. Its entire assets, including sets, costumes and props that had been accumulated over 43 years were destroyed. Despite this, Rey Cola√ßo tried to continue, leasing the Teatro Avenida where she presented Miguel Franco's O Mutim. The premiere was attended by the President of the Republic and, afterwards, the play was immediately banned even though it had been cleared by the censors. It was only realised three days after the premiere that interrogation scenes could be related to the practices of the dictatorship. Given this, it was perhaps ironic that she was accused of serving the regime. Once again, she tried to rebuild but then in 1967 the Teatro Avenida also burnt down. She rented another theatre and made her last appearance as an actress in 1973. In early 1974, her company returned to Teatro S√£o Luiz, where she had started. On 25 April 1974 the Carnation Revolution took place, which ended the rule of the authoritarian Estado Novo. In view of the criticisms made that she served the regime, she suspended the company. Television She reappeared in 1982 in a television series entitled Gente fina √© outra coisa. Later, she dedicated herself to helping the National Theatre Museum improve its exhibitions. Her last television role was at the age of 87. Am√©lia Rey Cola√ßo died on July 8, 1990 in Lisbon.

The Libyan National Army of Marshal Khalifa Haftar took the city from the forces of the Fayez el-Sarraj Government. Background In 2011, during the first Libyan civil war, Sirte formed the last stronghold of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who died there on October 20.Fr√©d√©ric Bobin, La prise de Syrte est une √©tape majeure dans l‚Äôoffensive du mar√©chal Haftar en Libye, Le Monde, 7 janvier 2020. In 2015, during the Second Libyan Civil War, the city fell into the hands of the jihadists of Islamic State. It was taken in December 2016 by the forces of the Government of National Accord (GNA), after a six-month battle and more than 700 dead from the Misrata Brigades. After the defeat of Islamic State, Sirte was controlled by the Misrata Brigades, a group within the Al-Bounyan Al-Marsous coalition, and by Brigade 604, a Madkhalist Salafist militia. All of these troops are assembled within the \\"Sirte Protection Force.\\" Brigade 604 claimed not to take sides between Sarraj and Haftar,Frederic Wehrey, Quiet No More?, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 13 octobre 2016. its declared enemies being the Muslim Brotherhood and the jihadist Salafists, however most of its fighters are Ferjani, the tribe of Field Marshal Haftar.

Sirte and its region are mainly populated by two tribes: the Qadhadhfa - the tribe of Muammar Gadhafi - and the Warfalla, considered to be faithful to the memory of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Battle On January 4, 2020, the forces of the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Marshal Khalifa Haftar began a sudden attack on the city of Sirte. Ghardabiya Airport, south of the city, was captured and its defenders surrendered.C√©lian Mac√©, Libye : Haftar annonce la prise de Syrte, Lib√©ration, 6 janvier 2020.Libye: prise surprise de Syrte par les forces de Khalifa Haftar, RFI, 6 janvier 2020. Soldiers of the LNA then entered the city through five axes to the south and east. Special forces seized the port from the sea. The 604 Brigade then defected and attacked the Misrata Brigades on their rear. Disorganized, the latter retreated and abandoned the city. After only three hours of fighting, Sirte thus passed into the hands of the LNA forces, which faced only weak resistance. Haftar's soldiers were greeted with enthusiasm by locals waving posters bearing the likeness of Gaddafi and green flags of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.

It is made of identical pieces of a cone whose apex angle equals the angle of an even sided regular polygon.. In principle, there are infinitely many polycons, as many as there are even sided regular polygons. Most members of the family have elongated spindle like shapes. The polycon family generalizes the sphericon. It was discovered by the Israeli inventor David Hirsch in 2017 Construction ‚Ä¢ Two adjacent edges of an even sided regular polygon are extended till they reach the polygon's axis of symmetry that is furthest from the edges' common vertex. ‚Ä¢ By rotating the two resulting line segments around the polygon's axis of symmetry that passes through the common vertex, a right circular cone is created. ‚Ä¢ Two planes are passed such that each one of them contains the normal to the polygon at its center point and one of the two distanced vertices of the two edges. ‚Ä¢ The cone part that lies between the two planes is replicated \\\\frac{n}{2}-1 times, where {n} is the number of the polygon's edges. All \\\\frac{n}{2} parts are joined at their planer surfaces to create a spindle shaped object. It has {n} curved edges which pass through alternating vertices of the polygon. ‚Ä¢ The obtained object is cut in half at its plane of symmetry (the polygon's plane). ‚Ä¢ The two identical halves are reunited after being rotated at an offset angle of \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n} Edges and vertices A polycon based on a regular polygon with {n} edges has {n+2} vertices, {n} of which coincide with the polygon's vertices, with the remaining two lying at the extreme ends of the solid. It has {n} edges, each one being half of the conic section created where the cone's surface intersects one of the two cutting planes. On each side of the polygonal cross- section, \\\\frac{n}{2} edges of the polycon run (from every second vertex of the polygon) to one of the solid's extreme ends. The edges on one side are offset by an angle of \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n} from those on the other side. The edges of the sphericon ({n=4}) are circular. The edges of the hexacon ({n=6}) are parabolic. All other polycons' edges are hyperbolic. The sphericon as a polycon The sphericon is the first member of the polycon family. It is also a member of the poly-sphericon and the convex hull of the two disc roller (TDR convex hull) families. In each of the families, it is constructed differently. As a poly-sphericon, it is constructed by cutting a bicone with an apex angle of \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} at its plane of symmetry and reuniting the two obtained parts after rotating them at an offset angel of \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}. As a TDR convex hull it is the convex hull of two perpendicular 180¬∞ circular sectors joined at their centers. As a polycon, the starting point is a cone created by rotating two adjacent edges of a square around its axis of symmetry that passes through their common vertex. In this specific case there is no need to extend the edges because their ends reach the square's other axis of symmetry. Since, in this specific case, the two cutting planes coincide with the plane of the cone's base, nothing is discarded and the cone remains intact. By creating another identical cone and joining the two cones together using their flat surfaces, a bicone is created. From here the construction continues in the same way described for the construction of the sphericon as a poly-sphericon. The only difference between the sphericon as a poly-sphericon and sphericon as a polycon is that as a poly- sphericon it has four vertices and as a polycon it is considered to have six. The additional vertices are not noticeable because they are located in the middle of the circular edges, and merge with them completely. Rolling properties The surface of each polycon is a single developable face. Thus the entire family has rolling properties that are related to the meander motion of the sphericon, as do some members of the poly-sphericon family. Because the polysphericons' surfaces consist of conical surfaces and various kinds of frustum surfaces (conical and/or cylindrical), their rolling properties change whenever each of the surfaces touches the rolling plane. This is not the case with the polycons. Because each one of them is made of only one kind of conical surface the rolling properties remain uniform throughout the entire rolling motion. The instantaneous motion of the polycon is identical to a cone rolling motion around one of its {n} central vertices. The motion, as a whole, is a combination of these motions with each of the vertices serving in turn as an instant center of rotation around which the solid rotates during \\\\frac{1}{n} of the rotation cycle. Once another vertex comes into contact with the rolling surface it becomes the new temporary center of rotation, and the rotation vector flips to the opposite direction. The resulting overall motion is a meander that is linear on average. Each of the two extreme vertices touches the rolling plane, instantaneously, \\\\frac{n}{2} times in one rotation cycle. The instantaneous line of contact between the polycon and the surface it is rolling on is a segment of one of the generatinglines of a cone, and everywhere along this line the tangent plane to the polycon is the same. When \\\\frac{n}{2} is an odd number this tangent plane is a constant distance from the tangent plane to the generating line on the polycon surface which is instantaneously uppermost. Thus the polycons, for \\\\frac{n}{2} odd, are constant height rollers (as is a right circular bicone, a cylinder or a prism with Reuleaux triangle cross- section). Polycons, for \\\\frac{n}{2} even, don't possess this feature. History The sphericon was first introduced by David Hirsch in 1980 in a patent he named 'A Device for Generating a Meander Motion'.David Haran Hirsch (1980): \\"Patent no. 59720: A device for generating a meander motion; Patent drawings; Patent application form; Patent claims The principle, according to which it was constructed, as described in the patent, is consistent with the principle according to which poly-sphericons are constructed. Only more than 25 years later, following Ian Stewart's article about the sphericon in the Scientific American Journal, it was realized both by members of the woodturning [17, 26] and mathematical [16, 20] communities that the same construction method could be generalized to a series of axial-symmetric objects that have regular polygon cross sections other than the square. The surfaces of the bodies obtained by this method (not including the sphericon itself) consist of one kind of conic surface, and one, or more, cylindrical or conical frustum surfaces. In 2017 Hirsch began exploring a different method of generalizing the sphericon, one that is based on a single surface without the use of frustum surfaces. The result of this research was the discovery of the polycon family. The new family was first introduced at the 2019 Bridges Conference in Linz, Austria, both at the art works gallery and at the film festival References Category:Geometric shapes Category:Euclidean solid geometry ","title":"Polycon"},{"id":"65261729","text":"Michel Roques (20 July 1946 - 8 October 2006) was a French racing cyclist.

Mike Smith era The Wales national side had reached the quarter-finals of the 1976 European Championships but suffered a controversial defeat to Yugoslavia and failed to reach the finals. The team's competitiveness had raised optimism amongst supporters ahead of qualifying for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, but this was eroded quickly as they suffered a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Scotland in their first qualifying game. However, a surprise 3‚Äì0 victory over Czechoslovakia, reigning European champions and unbeaten in their previous 22 fixtures, kept their hopes alive. Qualifying would not be completed until the end of 1977 as the 1976‚Äì77 British Home Championship was played in between. The competition began with a goalless draw with Scotland before a game against England became synonymous with Welsh nationalism. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) had started playing the Welsh anthem, \\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\\", ahead of games and requested that the anthem be played before the game alongside the English anthem, \\"God Save the Queen. The Football Association (FA) refused the request, a decision which infuriated many of the Welsh players. At the match, the two teams stood in line for God Save the Queen but, as the English team took position ready to start the match, the Welsh side remained in line. FA officials attempted to hurry the players away but the Welsh side stood and sang their anthem on their own as the home crowd jeered. Spurred on, Wales went on to secure their only victory at Wembley Stadium as Leighton James converted a penalty he had won after being fouled by Peter Shilton to win 1‚Äì0. A 1‚Äì1 draw with Northern Ireland secured a second place finish in the Championship. In September 1977, Wales played back-to-back fixtures against Kuwait, who became the first Arab side to play in Great Britain during the first match at the Racecourse Ground. The two teams played out a goalless draw and repeated the result two weeks later in Kuwait City. Qualification for the 1978 World Cup resumed in October, but Wales were forced to seek an alternative venue when both Ninian Park and the Racecourse Ground had their safety certificates revoked, resulting in capacity at the venues being greatly reduced. The match was eventually held at Anfield in Liverpool, becoming the first Welsh home fixture to be played outside the country since 1890. Despite attempts to ensure Welsh fans received priority for the home fixture, Scottish fans were able to obtain the majority of the tickets. There were numerous incidents of Wales fans being mugged by opposing fans outside the ground for their tickets, including FAW president Terry Squire who lost his to a pickpocket. Other Welsh fans at the game left at halftime, fearing for their own safety. There was further controversy on the pitch as Scotland were awarded a penalty for handball, despite the arm that had connected with the ball belonging to Scottish forward Joe Jordan. Scotland converted the penalty and added a second as Wales pushed for an equaliser to win the game. A 1‚Äì0 defeat to Czechoslovakia in their final qualifying game left Wales bottom of the group. Wales manager Mike Smith was rewarded with a new three-year contract at the end of 1977, nearly doubling his annual salary in the process. He led the side to another second place finish in the 1977‚Äì78 British Home Championship, before enjoying a positive start to qualifying for the 1980 European Championships. They began their campaign by defeating Malta 7‚Äì0 at the Racecourse Ground with Ian Edwards scoring four of his side's goals. This was followed by a 1‚Äì0 victory over Turkey before they finished the first round of fixtures by losing 2‚Äì0 to West Germany. A third consecutive second place finish in the 1978‚Äì79 British Home Championship followed, which included a John Toshack hat-trick in a 3‚Äì0 win over Scotland, before Malta were defeated again in June 1979. However, the side's good form came to an end as they suffered defeats to West Germany and Turkey to finish third in their group and failed to qualify for the 1980 World Cup. Byron Stevenson later received a four-and-a-half year ban from international football after breaking the jaw of an opposition player in the latter game. The match was also Smith's final game in charge of the national side as he accepted an offer to manage Hull City. England takes over Wales =Arrival and 1982 World Cup= The FAW compiled a six-man shortlist to find Smith's replacement and eventually appointed former captain Mike England in his first managerial role. He took charge of his first match in May 1980 against England and met his players for the first time only three days before the match. England had beaten reigning World Cup holders Argentina four days prior but Wales recorded an upset by winning 4‚Äì1 at the Racecourse with goals from Mickey Thomas, James, Ian Walsh and an own goal. The victory was their first home win over England for 25 years and remains their biggest win over their opponents, while the nature of the defeat led to violent clashes between the two sets of supporters. However, Wales were unable to capitalise on their victory, losing both of their remaining fixtures to finish third in the 1979‚Äì80 British Home Championship. England's first qualifying campaign in his new role was for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and consecutive 4‚Äì0 victories over Iceland and Turkey in their opening games led him to declare that Wales were \\"heading for the finals in 1982\\". His confidence was further raised when they defeated both Czechoslovakia and Turkey 1‚Äì0 to win their opening four games. Wales' good form continued in the 1980‚Äì81 British Home Championship, defeating Scotland and holding England to a goalless draw at Wembley. The results meant that a win over Northern Ireland in their final game would give Wales their first Home Championship title since 1937. However, an increase in violence during The Troubles led ten of Wales' squad to refuse to travel for the match, despite assurances from Sinn F√©in over safety. With England also refusing to travel, the competition was halted with no winner declared for the only time in the competition's history. Wales resumed qualifying for the 1982 World Cup by holding the Soviet Union to a goalless draw at the Racecourse with more than 29,000 spectators attending. Wales travelled to Czechoslovakia in September 1981 knowing a win would almost guarantee qualification, but an own goal by goalkeeper Dai Davies, the first goal he had conceded in more than 450 minutes of qualifying, and a second Czech goal in the second half gave Wales their first defeat of the campaign. In their next game, Wales were favourites to beat Iceland and took the lead in the first half. However, an electrical fire at Vetch Field delayed the match for more than 40 minutes with the players finishing the final minute of the first half before immediately returning to the dressing room for half time. Iceland took advantage of the disruption, equalising in the first minute of the second half and, despite Alan Curtis again giving Wales the lead, Iceland severely dented Wales' qualification hopes by securing a 2‚Äì2 draw. An irate England criticised his side's supporters, accusing rival fans of Cardiff City and Swansea City of being more focused on barracking each other than supporting their side. Wales' entered their final game needing a point against the Soviet Union to qualify but their preparations were disrupted as the Russian authorities demanded that the Welsh side first travel to Riga and then Tbilisi before changing the team's hotel on arrival with England accusing the opposition of \\"trying to make things uncomfortable for us\\". His side fell to a 3‚Äì0 defeat in the game. The result, coupled with that of the Czechs, meant that Wales failed to qualify having finished tied on points with the Czechs but ultimately losing out on goal difference. =1984 European Championships= A draw with Spain and defeats to Scotland and England in the 1981‚Äì82 British Home Championship left Wales winless in their previous eight fixtures, before they broke the run by beating Northern Ireland 3‚Äì0, a match which attracted Wales' lowest post-war crowd for an international with only 2,315 fans attending at the Racecourse.. Crowds remained low as Wales began their qualifying campaign for the 1984 European Championships with a 1‚Äì0 win over Norway in front of less than 4,500 at Vetch Field. In their second fixture, Wales recovered from 4‚Äì2 down to draw 4‚Äì4 with Yugoslavia before losing to England in the 1983‚Äì84 British Home Championship. The match against England attracted only 24,000 fans at Wembley, adding increasing pressure on the future of the competition. A single goal from Jeremy Charles secured a victory over Bulgaria in their third qualifying match as Wales led the group early on. Before they continued their qualifying campaign, Wales secured a lucrative friendly against Brazil at Ninian Park in June 1983, paying ¬£50,000 for the side to travel. Despite their opponents lofty reputation the match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, with Wales having initially led through Brian Flynn's goal, and generated more than ¬£200,000 for the FAW. A goalless draw with Norway in September, along with their opponents subsequent defeat to Yugoslavia, left Wales needing only two points from their final two matches to qualify. The first of the two fixtures started on bad terms as Wales arrived in Bulgaria to find their training ground of poor standard. England referred to the facilities as a \\"gypsy site\\" and Bulgarian officials later admitted that the poor facilities were chosen in retaliation for Wales' refusal to allow the Bulgarian team to train at the Racecourse Ground ahead of their previous meeting. Wales went on to lose the match 1‚Äì0 while England complained of the Bulgarians physical tactics, especially against Ian Rush who commented that he had \\"received the most savage treatment I had ever had to take\\", including being spat on by opposition substitutes. Nevertheless, Wales went into their final game against Yugoslavia at Ninian Park knowing a win would guarantee qualification. In an attempt to boost their chances, the FAW made a request to their English counterparts to postpone club games featuring Welsh players but this was rejected. Robbie James gave Wales the lead in the second half but Yugoslavia equalised before holding out to secure a draw. Wales could still qualify for the tournament if Bulgaria and Yugoslavia drew their final game or Bulgaria won by a single goal. The match nearly went in Wales' favour, with the match tied at 2‚Äì2 until the 92nd minute when Ljubomir Radanoviƒá scored a late winning goal for Yugoslavia, winning the group for his side and ending Wales' hopes of qualifying. Wales were dealt a further blow by the decision to end the British Home Championship in its 100th year as the competition was one of the FAW's biggest revenue streams. The final competition began with a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Scotland but Wales went on to record a victory over England, with Mark Hughes scoring the only goal on his debut, and drew with eventual winners Northern Ireland. =1986 World Cup= Wales began their qualifying campaign for the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Iceland in Reykjavik. England was furious with his understrength side for losing, while the Western Mail described the defeat as \\"one of the most disastrous defeats in the history of Welsh football.\\" They lost to Spain in their second match but won their first game of the campaign in the reverse fixture against Iceland at the end of 1984. While their hopes of qualifying as group winners were largely over, the team focused on securing a second place finish which would qualify them for a play-off against teams from other continental federations to qualify. These hopes were boosted by a 1‚Äì0 victory over Scotland in Glasgow with Rush scoring the only goal of the game, while FAW secretary Alun Evans also claimed that the match essentially saved the organisation from bankruptcy by ensuring large crowds for their remaining group matches. This was followed by a 3‚Äì0 victory over Spain with Rush scoring a brace and Hughes a bicycle kick described in The Independent as \\"a goal of jaw-dropping audacity and athleticism\\". In an attempt to maximise profits, the FAW scheduled the deciding final fixture at the Cardiff Arms Park. However, having initially agreed to the suggestion, the Welsh Rugby Union after refused amid fears over football hooliganism following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Three of the four teams in the group could still qualify ahead of the game, with Wales needing to win to guarantee at least a second place finish. More than 39,000 fans attended the game, moved to Ninian Park, and Wales took the lead in the opening 15 minutes through Hughes. In the second half, Scotland were awarded a controversial penalty when a shot struck the arm of Wales' David Phillips. Goalkeeper Neville Southall got a hand to the penalty but was unable to stop the shot as Scotland equalised. Scotland held on to secure the point needed to finish second and reach the qualifying play-offs. However, the match was overshadowed by the death of Scottish manager Jock Stein who suffered a heart attack in the dugout in the aftermath of his side's penalty. Spain's victory over Iceland, combined with the draw to Scotland, meant Wales had failed to qualify for the previous three major international tournament in their final match. In attempt to raise funds, Wales played five friendlies in four months between February and May 1985. The first saw Wales become the first British side to play in Saudi Arabia, as Wales beat the home nation 2‚Äì1. The match earned the FAW ¬£20,000 with Evans surprised to receive payment in the form of a briefcase of cash at the match. A month later, Wales defeated the Republic of Ireland 1‚Äì0 with Joey Jones coming out of international retirement to win a record 69th cap, surpassing Ivor Allchurch's record. A match against Uruguay backfired when a low crowd attended a goalless draw, with the gate receipts failing to cover the ¬£30,000 paid to Uruguay to play the match. The final two matches were played against Canada. =1988 European Championships and departure= Wales played their first competitive fixture for a year when they drew 1‚Äì1 with Finland to begin their qualifying campaign for the 1988 European Championships. A further draw with the Soviet Union and a win over Finland in the reverse fixture kept Wales' hopes of qualifying alive. The team also earned a late draw against Czechoslovakia, Rush equalising late in a game that Wales had struggled to make an impact in. Wales' campaign continued with consecutive fixtures against Denmark, winning the first match 1‚Äì0 at the Ninian Park. The second match ended with the same scoreline, but this time in favour of the Danes. England was furious with the winning goal, commenting \\"we were not beaten by Denmark, we were beaten by the referee. The player was four yards offside\\". The result left Wales needing to beat Czechoslovakia to qualify. The FAW were incensed ahead of the game when the FA postponed matches featuring English players but refused to do the same for Welsh players. As a result, Wales initially travelled to Prague with only ten fit players. Wales adopted an attacking approach to the match and had an early attempt cleared off the line but the Czechs went on to win 2‚Äì0. The defeat to Czechoslovakia ultimately cost England his position and he left Wales after eight years. The FAW immediately identified Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough as their first choice replacement, and he was favourable to taking the position but relented when Forest refused to allow him to work simultaneously with both Wales and Forest. David Williams was appointed as caretaker-manager with the FAW still hoping that Clough would take the position. Williams' only match in charge ended in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Yugoslavia. Terry Yorath was appointed on a short-term contract covering Wales' next three games, with the FAW still waiting for Clough. Rush was critical of this approach, describing it as \\"so unsettling\\". Yorath's tenure began with a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Sweden although he was hampered by so many defensive injuries that his chosen defence consisted of four midfielders. He won his second match, 3‚Äì2 against Malta, and led his side to a 1‚Äì0 win over Italy in Milan three days later. Rankings rise under Yorath The victory over Italy led the FAW to appoint Yorath on a full-time basis, alongside his position at Swansea with the FAW paying a third of his club wages as compensation. His first match as the permanent manager was a defeat to the Netherlands in September 1988 in Wales' opening qualifier for the 1990 FIFA World Cup and a 2‚Äì2 draw with Finland a month later essentially ended their hopes of qualification early on. Their following qualifier against West Germany was moved to the National Stadium and attracted a positive response from the manager, players and fans as a goalless draw raised more than ¬£250,000 in revenue for the FAW. However, their poor qualifying campaign continued as they lost all three of their remaining fixtures and finished bottom of their qualifying group. The improvement in finances did however provide the FAW with opportunity to improve the grassroots level of the game, with the under-21 team resurrected and the appointment of Jim Shoulder to oversee the youth development of the game in Wales. The qualifying campaign for the 1992 European Championships saw Wales drawn alongside Luxembourg, Belgium and the now unified Germany and started positively as they defeated Belgium in October 1990 in their opening match. Wales were given a scare against Luxembourg when Clayton Blackmore was sent off in the opening 15 minutes but they were able to secure a narrow victory through Rush's second goal of the campaign. A 1‚Äì1 draw with Belgium left Wales in direct competition with Germany to be group winners ahead of consecutive games against the pair. In preparation, Wales organised friendlies against Iceland and Poland. Yorath's assistant Peter Shreeves was placed in charge for the first match to allow Yorath to watch Germany in preparation for their meetings. Iceland were beaten 1‚Äì0 while the match against Poland ended in a goalless draw. Germany were unbeaten in 16 matches prior to the first meeting between the two sides at the National Stadium. The ground was sold out for the game, which turned in favour of Wales when Germany were reduced to ten men as Thomas Berthold was dismissed after an altercation with Kevin Ratcliffe. Wales capitalised as Rush scored his third goal in qualifying and, despite pressure from the Germans late in the game, Wales held out to win. The win led the FAW to appoint Yorath on a full-time basis, as he gave up his club commitments for the role. Ahead of their second game against Germany, Wales met Brazil at the National Stadium for a friendly in which Southall won his 53rd cap to become Wales' most capped goalkeeper. Wales caused a further surprise by beating the Brazilians following a goal from Dean Saunders. However, Wales' optimism for the second tie was misplaced as they fell to a 4‚Äì1 defeat in Nuremberg, giving Germany the advantage in the group. A 1‚Äî0 win over Luxembourg in their final game moved Wales to the top of the group, with Peter Nicholas surpassing Jones cap record by winning his 73rd cap. To qualify, Germany needed to win both of their final mat he's against Belgium and Luxembourg, a feat they duly achieved as Wales finished second by a point nd subsequently failed to qualify for the final tournament. The team's narrow failure to qualify, along with a win over the Republic of Ireland and a draw with Austria in friendlies, led Wales to be considered contenders to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Yorath dispensed with the sweeper formation for the opening match against Romania but the decision proved disastrous as they suffered a 5‚Äì1 defeat. Yorath was absent for a friendly defeat to the Netherlands and the team's two matches in the Kirin Cup tournament held in Japan following the sudden death of his son, with Shreeves again taking charge. With Yorath returning Wales defeated the Faroe Islands 6‚Äì0 in their next qualifying match, including a hat-trick from Rush which tied him with Trevor Ford and Allchurch as Wales' leading goalscorer of all-time. After defeating Cyprus, Wales faced back-to-back matches against Belgium. The first game ended in a defeat before Wales won the second, Rush becoming the leading goalscorer with his 24th international goal while Ryan Giggs scored his first. Yorath led his team to four further qualifying matches without defeat, beating both Cyprus and the Faroe Islands and drawing both ties against the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks. Wales faced a deciding game against Romania in their final match, with four teams in the group still able to qualify depending on the results, with a win almost guaranteeing qualification. Wales entered the game as the last Home Nation able to qualify, while the match received an intense build-up in the media. Romania took the lead early on when Gheorghe Hagi's shot slipped past Southall but Saunders equalised after an hour. The momentum of the game shifted towards Wales, with Giggs later commenting \\"Their (Romania) morale collapsed, and I could see from their body language that they didn't want to know.\\" Two minutes later, Gary Speed was fouled in the area and Wales were awarded a penalty. Paul Bodin took the spot kick, but his effort struck the crossbar. Barry Horne remarked that \\"if the penalty had gone in, we would have run out 2‚Äì1 or 3‚Äì1 winners because they had folded.\\" Instead, with Wales pushing forward for the winning goal, Romania added a second goal and won the match 2‚Äì1, ending Wales' hopes of qualifying. The match was further marred by the death of a supporter when a marine flare was fired inside the National Stadium, striking the fan in the neck. The Welsh side were left devastated by the defeat, Yorath sat in a stairwell at the National Stadium and wept, Giggs was pulled over for speeding on the way home from the game which he attributed to his mindset from the defeat while Speed described the result as \\"the most painful match of my career\\". Bodin, the penalty taker, never played for Wales again. Despite failing to qualify, Wales achieved the highest FIFA World ranking in their history at the time, reaching 27th place. Upheaval under Toshack, Smith and Gould With his contract due to expire, Yorath made a request for a payrise for his new deal. The request was not well received by the FAW and Yorath lowered his request when told of budgetary constraints but was told he would have to reapply for his job. Yorath was ultimately informed that he would not be offered a new deal and the FAW eventually appointed John Toshack as the new manager, alongside his club role with Spanish side Real Sociedad. His appointment proved relatively unpopular among both players and fans, and in his first match Wales suffered a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Norway at Ninian Park. The defeat was largely attributed to the new playing style brought in by Toshack and, 48 days into his tenure, he stepped down from the role after a single match. At the time, Yorath was bringing a case of unfair dismissal against the FAW, but offered to drop the action if he was rehired. The FAW refused to consider him for the role and instead reappointed former manager Mike Smith; he had been Toshack's assistant during his brief spell. In his autobiography, Yorath later claimed that the FAW chose to replace him because they resented his popularity with the Welsh fans. Smith began his second spell with two friendlies, a defeat to Sweden and a victory over Estonia. Southall equalled Nicholas' caps record in the first match before surpassing it in the second. With many new nations gaining independence following the breakups of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, Wales faced three opponents for the first time in qualifying for the 1996 European Championships, Georgia, Albania and Moldova, along with Bulgaria and Germany. Wales secured a 2‚Äì0 victory over Albania in their opening match, but suffered back-to-back defeats against the other two new sides, including a heavy 5‚Äì0 loss to Georgia. Two defeats to Bulgaria led to Smith coming under increasing pressure and, despite earning a point away to Germany in April 1995, his contract was terminated after a 1‚Äì0 loss to Georgia. His replacement was Bobby Gould, who secured a victory over Moldova in his first match before ending the campaign with a defeat to Germany and a draw with Georgia. Gould's first full qualifying campaign as manager started inauspiciously as warm-up matches proved troublesome. A defeat to Italy in January 1996 saw both Rush and Phillips retire from international duty, while a further defeat to Switzerland was preceded by a falling out between Gould and Hughes. Further embarrassment was added when Wales suffered a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Fourth Division side Leyton Orient in May 1996 despite fielding a full strength side. Qualifying however began more positively as Wales defeated San Marino 5‚Äì0 and 6‚Äì0 in their opening fixtures, with Hughes returning to score four goals across the games. However, back-to-back fixtures against group favourites the Netherlands proved much more difficult; after losing 3‚Äì1 in Cardiff, Wales suffered their heaviest defeat in a competitive fixture in the return match, losing 7‚Äì1.

Early life  June Zimmerman was the daughter of Oliver Brunner Zimmerman and Grace Adele Bushnell Zimmerman. Contrary to some accounts of her early life, both of her parents were born in the American Midwest. Her father was a military engineer during World War I, who taught at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California, and wrote a manual for tractor engine maintenance. She graduated from Lyons Township High School in Illinois, and studied dance with Michel Fokine and other Russian dancers.  Career  Zarina danced with the Chicago Opera Civic Ballet as a young woman, and gave dance recitals for community groups in the midwest. She appeared as a dancer in films Morning Judge (1926) and Chucho el Roto (1934). In 1935, she made her New York debut at the Guild Theatre, in a program of regional Mexican and \\"interpretive\\" dances with elaborate costumes. She traveled in Mexico and many Asian countries during the 1930s and 1940s, studying, performing, and teaching traditional dances. She studied with Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç VII in Japan. For a time, when her travels were restricted during World War II, she taught dance to the daughter of the Shah of Iran. While in Iran, she worked with a fellow American expatriate, Nilla Cram Cook, who held a high position in Iran's Ministry of Education. An illustration depicting Zarina by Magda Nachman was published in Dance Magazine in 1952. She was on the program at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1955. She wrote a book, Classic Dances of the Orient (1967), with \\"particularly extensive treatments of the Indian Bhurat Natyam and the Japanese Nihan Buyo.\\"  Personal life  Zarina died in 1967, in her sixties, in Mexico City.

The series interviews DEA agents and witnesses to Camarena's death who state that he was murdered by Mexican drug lords, with the complicity of the CIA. The series was released by Amazon in July 2020. Plot The docuseries recounts the story of DEA Agent Kiki Camarena's investigation of Mexican cartel drug lords including Miguel Gallardo, Ernesto Carrillo and Rafael Caro Quintero, his death at the hands of drug lords and the CIA, and the DEA relations that followed Camarena's death. It counts among other with the testimonies of former DEA H√©ctor Berellez that led the investigation of Camarena's murder in operation Leyenda; Phil Jordan, former DEA Intelligence Director; Mike Holm, DEA resident agent in charge in Guadalajara when Camarena got kidnapped; and Manny Medrano, former assistant US Attorney and Lead Prosecutor in Camarena case. In the telling of Camarena's wife and former DEA Phil Jordan and Mike Holm, Camarena cost the cartels billions of dollars when his investigations led the Mexican Army to burn down Ranch B√∫falo, a major marijuana plantation. Camarena earned further enemies by discovering that the CIA was working with the cartels to fund anti-communist Contras in Nicaragua. The docuseries interviews the DEA agent who spearheaded the investigation of Camarena's death. The agent, Hector Berrellez, states that the CIA agent F√©lix Ismael Rodr√≠guez helped torture Camerena to learn what Camarena knew about US connections to Mexican cartels. According to Berrellez, Camarena was killed because he was going to disclose these connections. Also interviewed are employees and enforcers of the cartels who helped capture and torture Camarena, but later became witnesses for the DEA. Historians also contend that the CIA participated in Camarena's killing. One year before Camarena's murder, Mexican journalist Manuel Buend√≠a was assassinated in Mexico City: some journalists and historians have concluded that the killings of Buend√≠a and Camarena were linked, since both discovered that the US Central Intelligence Agency was using Mexican and Central American drug traffickers to import \\"cocaine into the U.S. and [facilitate] the movement of arms to the contras.\\"pp.171, 402‚Äì403, 413. Hector Berrellez, the DEA agent who supervised the task force investigating Camarena's murder, has long maintained that the CIA was involved in Camarena's killing. Former cartel employees told USA Today that a DEA official and CIA operative participated in meetings with the cartel where Camarena's abduction was discussed. In 2019, the United States Department of Justice began reinvestigating Camarena's murder. After Camarena's death, Caro-Quintero was arrested and convicted for Camarena's murder, but was released by the Mexican government in 2013. The docuseries shoots footage in the home where Camarena was tortured and murdered, now an elementary school. During interviews with Camarena's wife, she states that she believes neither the US nor Mexican governments told her the whole truth about her husband's death. The CIA has denied any involvement in Camarena's death. The series features interviews with real persons involved in Camarena's life and death, and dramatizes others; a few fictional characters are based on a composite of other real personalities. Production The documentary's director, Tiller Russell, researched Camarena's murder for 14 years, and then shot and edited The Last Narc for two years. Russell has kept his location a secret, fearing for his safety. He said that after he asked Jorge Godoy one interview question, Godoy drew a pistol. Russell told Fox News that in making The Last Narc, \\"We have absolutely zero latitude for fictionalizing or dramatizing anything. All we can do is adhere to these first-hand and first-person experiences.\\" The Last Narc was produced by Eli Holzmann and Aaron Saidman. Reception The Daily Beast reviewed The Last Narc favorably, calling it a \\"a wide-ranging expose about the entangled relationship between the CIA, the Mexican government, the DFS (Mexico‚Äôs secret police, created by the CIA) and the cartels.\\" According to the Florida-based CE Noticias Financieras, The Last Narc \\"is notable\\" for approaching the story of Camarena's death beyond the ordinary patriotic narratives of the US and Mexican government. The newspaper writes that The Last Narc makes a convincing argument about Camarena's death: \\"In a blunt way, this work by Amazon also establishes something that has been ventilated before: the Sinaloa Cartel was a creation of the PRI regime through the DFS and the DFS, in turn, was a creation of the CIA.\\" References Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:Prime Video original programming Category:2010s American documentary television series Category:English-language television shows ","title":"The Last Narc (TV series)"},{"id":"65262139","text":"Ekaterini Xagorari (born June 21, 1964, Athens, Greece) is the Greek Ambassador to Switzerland and non resident Ambassador to the Principality of Liechtenstein.

For almost two years he commanded the remote station at Stanley Falls, where he had to deal with hostile local people and Arabs. Early years (1856‚Äì1883) Arvid Mauritz Wester was born on 10 June 1856 in Karlskoga parish, √ñrebro County, Sweden. He was descended from the younger son of Peder Wester. He joined the army as a volunteer on 1 May 1874. On 14 July 1877 he enrolled as a cadet at the Military School. He was appointed second lieutenant in the 21st infantry regiment (N√§rkes regiment) on 2 December 1878. He decided to take service with the new International African Association (AIA). Congo (1883‚Äì1886) Wester and about ten other Swedish officers were hired by King Leopold II of Belgium to help found the Congo Free State. Wester was admitted as an assistant on 1 November 1883, and left for the Congo on 14 November 1883. He arrived in Vivi on 5 January 1884 and reached L√©opoldville on 5 February 1884. Captain Edmond Hanssens headed upstream from L√©opoldville on 23 March 1884 with the three steamers and six Europeans: Wester, Louis-Gustave Amelot, Frederick Drees, Auguste-Joseph Gu√©rin, Ernest Courtois and Nicholls. Wester and Courtois took the lead on the Royal, with the engineer Gu√©rin, but the steamer hit a rock and was holed. They made hasty repairs and caught up with the flotilla downstream from Kinshasa. However, a mechanical problem developed that took a long time to repair, and a tornado broke out. They did not rejoin the flotilla until 26 March 1884 at noon. The expedition reached √âquateurville on 17 April 1884. Wester and Courtois remained there while Hanssens and Alphonse van G√®le explored the lower Ubangi River and the Mongala River. On 4 June Wester rejoined Hanssens' column, which reached the Itimbiri and ascended that river for . Courtois fell ill there and died on 26 June 1884. Wester circa 1885 The expedition arrived at the Falls on 3 July 1884. Hassens relieved Adrian Binnie, who had commanded there since Henry Morton Stanley's visit in December 1883, and would return to the coast. He replaced him by Wester, with Amelot as deputy. On 11 July 1884 Hanssens left the Falls. Wester had only 20 Hausa soldiers, and at first had to fight serious battles against the local people before gaining their esteem and trust. He also had to contend with the Arabs led by Tippu Tip, who wanted to take over the station. He signed a treaty of friendship with Tippo-Tip's son, Moini Amani, stipulating that the Arabs would not pass to the north of the station. However, within a month the Arabs had violated the agreement. Too weak to retaliate, Wester concentrated on improving his defenses. Towards the end of 1884 Van G√®le made a visit to the Falls accompanied by the intendant Camille Van den Plas and the Swedish lieutenant Edde Gleerup. He left the Equateur post on 20 November 1884. Well before reaching the Aruwimi River he noticed that the local people had been terrorized by a recent attack by the Arabs against the Basokos. The supply expedition continued on to Stanley Falls. The land upstream from the Aruwimi had all been deserted by the people, who had fled the Arabs. Soon after the expedition reached the Falls, Tippo-Tip sent his nephew Rachid to greet Van G√®le. Later that day Tippo-Tip himself visited Van G√®le and assured him he wanted cordial relations with the Europeans and would stop hunting for slaves. Van G√®le thought it was better to try to use Arab power to help the Belgians get established, as did Hanssens and Coquilhat. Van G√®le left Lieutenant Gleerup at the Falls to assist Wester. After the end of his term of service, Gleerup accepted an offer to travel east to Zanzibar under the protection of Tippu Tip. He left the station at the end of 1885 and reached Zanzibar at the end of June 1886. Gleerup thus became the eighth European and first Swede to cross Africa. Wester had fallen ill and was due to go on leave. Lieutenant Walter Deane was assigned to replace him, set out on the Stanley with forty Bangala soldiers and arrived at the Falls on 14 February 1886. Wester handed over command of the post to Deane and left on 21 February 1886. Wester arrived in Leopoldville on 26 March 1886 and in Banana on 23 April 1886. He returned to Europe on 10 June 1886. After Wester's departure, the situation worsened. Tippo-Tip returned to Zanzibar and was replaced by his nephew Rachid, an irreconcilable enemy of the Europeans. The Stanley Falls station was attacked by the Arabs in September 1886 and completely destroyed. Later career (1886‚Äì1914) Arvid Mauritz Wester Wester became a lieutenant in N√§rke's regiment in 1885. In 1905 he was appointed major in the Life Regiment's grenadiers, from where he was transferred in 1907 to the Gotland Infantry Regiment. He left the army in 1912.

Biography Stefan Arviddson was born in Tran√•s, Sweden in 1968. Arvidsson received his PhD in the History of religions at Lund University in 2000. In 2007, he was appointed Associate Professor of the History of Religions at Stockholm University. Since 2012, he has been Professor in the History of Religions at Stockholm University and Professor in the Study of Religions at Linnaeus University. Theories Arvidsson is a Marxist, \\"but not in a dogmatic way\\". Arvidsson regrets that the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the Left Party have abandoned what he considers genuine socialism. Arvidsson is a proponent of a more aggressive form of socialism in line with the Eat the Rich slogan. Arvidsson refers to this as \\"romantic socialism,\\" which he contrasts with \\"classic socialism\\". He has been the author and editor of numerous Marxist publications. Several of his publications and research projects have been funded by Sveriges riksbank. Arvidsson's PhD thesis examined Indo-European studies, and was published in English under the title Aryan Idols. The Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science (2006). Arvidsson considers Indo-European studies to be a pseudoscientific field, and has described Indo-European mythology as \\"the most sinister mythology of modern times\\". In his works, Arvidsson has sought to expose what he considers to be fascist political sympathies of Indo- Europeanists such as Georges Dum√©zil. Arvidsson suggests that such an exposure may result in the abolishment (\\"Ragnar√∂k\\") of the concept of Indo-European mythology. Selected works * Den lilla marxisten.

He went absent without leave, was court-martialled and jailed, and on his release lived in London where he played harmonica and mixed with folk musicians such as Peggy Seeger. He undertook a wide range of jobs and activities over the years, which by his own account included \\"barman, waiter, soldier, labourer, packer, wireman, hippie, factory worker, salesman, hobo, manager, leather craftsman, odd job man, clerical worker, reconciliation relief worker, social worker, sculptor, designer, collector, joker, transvestite, inventor, psychonaut, actor, catalyst, community worker, musician, traveller, instrument maker...\\". Liner notes, Michael O'Shea, 1982. Retrieved 8 September 2020 In the mid-1970s, he travelled to Bangladesh as a volunteer relief worker, returning with serious illnesses and a sitar, which he learned to play while convalescing. He then travelled to France, other parts of Europe and the Middle East, making a living as a street musician. Biography by Wilson Neate, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 8 September 2020 He constructed his own instrument, Mo Cara, and later wrote: > The instrument 'Mo Cara' (Gaelic for 'My friend') is a combination of at > least three instruments.

The > result was a sound that pleased and fascinated me... He busked in Covent Garden and the London Underground, with his Mo Cara, a 17-stringed instrument which he played using paintbrushes or (in some reports) chopsticks. In early 1980 he was approached to perform at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, and Scott arranged for him to perform at the Royal Festival Hall as the opening act for a concert by Ravi Shankar. He worked on an unreleased project with Rick Wakeman, and toured with Don Cherry, but then returned to busking in Covent Garden, where he was seen by cartoonist and musician Tom Johnston, of The The. Johnston introduced O'Shea to Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis of Wire, who offered to record O'Shea for their label, Dome. Known for his eccentricities, O'Shea was reluctant to be tied down to recording, but, a year later, in July 1981, turned up ready to record, saying that \\"the planets have lined up in the right way so I was thinking today‚Äôs the day\\". He recorded the album in one day at Blackwing Studio and it was released, but drew little attention at the time. The opening 15-minute track, \\"No Journey's End\\", was described in the Irish Times as \\"a thrilling piece of music [in which] O‚ÄôShea plays Mo Chara like a wooden gateway to different cultures, drawing from Indian tones, Middle Eastern scales and Irish tradition..\\". In 1982, O'Shea worked with Johnston and bandmate Matt Johnson on a second album, which fell through, and also recorded two tracks with Irish experimental musician Stano (John Denver Stanley) on the album Content To Write In I Dine Weathercraft. He continued to make his own instruments, and played on the title track of Larry Cosgrave's 1985 album Easter Island. O'Shea rarely performed publicly during the late 1980s and 1990s, and became involved in the growth of rave culture. He died in December 1991, aged 44, from injuries suffered when he was hit by a van in London. His album was reissued on CD in 2001 and again by AllChival Records in Dublin in 2019, with additional tracks from his 1982 and 1985 recordings.Niall Byrne, \\"Lost Irish musical genius finally getting recognition\\", Irish Times, 12 March 2019.

The flight was operated by a Boeing 727-92C with registration B-1018 and named \\"Super Cuihua.\\" On 16 February 1968, the aircraft crashed into Hunan village in Linkou Township, Taipei County (now Linkou District, New Taipei City), killing 21 of the 63 people on board as well as one person on the ground. 42 people were injured.  Accident  In the evening of 16 February 1968, B-1018 was flying from Hong Kong to Taipei Songshan Airport under the command of captain Stuart E. Dew, an unnamed first officer, and an unnamed flight engineer. Captain Hugh Hicks, the director of the airline's flight operations, was initially in the cockpit jumpseat, though Dew later let him perform the landing. Taipei's approach control cleared Flight 10 for an ILS approach and then transferred the flight to the tower control. The direction and heading of the plane were normal and weather was clear. However, Captain Hicks suddenly noticed that the aircraft was approaching too low, and immediately pushed the throttles in an attempt to go-around. The cockpit voice recorder then recorded him screaming: \\"Go to hell!\\" The aircraft then crashed into houses and burst into flames. Firefighters and the United States military assisted in the rescue.  Investigation  Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration released the final report on 4 March. It concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error, stating: * The aircraft functioned normally; * Weather was normal; * Pilots who landed at Shongshan reported that the ILS was working * There were no communication problems with air traffic control.  Aftermath  The 727 involved was leased from Southern Air Transport, and was Civil Air Transport's only aircraft that flew international routes. The crash resulted in the demise of the airline. International flights were taken over by China Airlines, and Civil Air Transport ceased operations in 1975 Exactly 30 years after this accident, China Airlines Flight 676, a flight from Bali, Indonesia to Taipei, crashed in Dayuan Township, Taoyuan County, (now Dayuan District, Taoyuan City) killing 203 people (all 196 on board and seven more on the ground).  Changes  Since the air traffic control radar failed to show the altitude of the aircraft, it was impossible to understand why Flight 10 decreased. After the crash of Eastern Airlines Flight 401 on December 29, 1972, in Miami, the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration began to introduce improved radar systems that displayed a flight's altitude.

The character is voiced by Ashley Johnson, and designed by and loosely based on various friends of series creator Owen Dennis.https://medium.com/@brittany.williams881/youre-never-too- old-3b0ec259342 The character first appeared in the series pilot created by Dennis and released by Cartoon Network Studios Shorts with which he pitched the show; she later appeared in the first episode \\"The Grid Car\\". Tulip is the focus of the first book of the series, appearing in every episode, and is mentioned throughout the second book, of which the focus is her reflection \\"MT\\" (Mirror Tulip), later known as Lake, in which both explore the metaphysical space of a seemingly infinite train. Background Tulip is a 13-year-old girl struggling with her parents' divorce who finds herself trapped on the train when trying to get to game-design camp. She is analytical, down-to-earth, and determined to get off the train. She encounters One-One, a spherical robot consisting of two separate hemisphere-shaped robots each known as One, one exuberant and optimistic and the other morose and pessimistic. Tulip has a neon green glowing number seemingly stamped permanently onto the palm on her right hand. In the pilot, the number 53 was on her palm but after the encounter with the Steward in Corginia, replaced by the number 49 towards the end of the pilot. In the series, the first number on Tulip's hand is 115, later raising or lowering depending on her moral choices and mental state. Tulip's character design was kept simple so she could be drawn in multiple angles with ease. Her build resembles that of a typical schoolgirl. She has very pale skin and a thin build, giving her a frail physique. She has long red-orange hair that is kept tied in a ponytail by a green band. She also has a green clip attached to the right side of her hair. Adorning her face is a pair of elliptically shaped glasses that rest atop her nose with no visible bridge between the lenses, making it have an appearance of the infinity symbol (‚àû). She wears a green hooded sweatshirt that has brown patches on the elbows with a white shirt underneath. She also wears a light gray mini skirt that matches her boots, and dark gray tights that stop around her ankles. She carries around with her a brown backpack that contains a notepad and a pencil with a frog eraser and is usually where One-One is placed when being carried by Tulip.https://the-pomegranate.com/2019/08/23/finding- your-exit-on-the-infinity-train/ In a Reddit AMA in September 2017, Dennis described \\"Tulip [a]s sort of the natural foil to a train that is full of improbable things. If you have a world where every train car is completely different, where laws of physics might change or where animals talk, who would be the person who would have the most trouble dealing with that? A super straightforward, close-minded, logical person. So that‚Äôs who the main character becomes, the person that is least equipped but has the most to learn about what is going on around them\\", in addition elaborating on the development of her character and how \\"[he] realized the elective Tulip would take [would be] programming and [how] she became like a fully formed person in my head.\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityTrain/comments/5em4s1/im_owen_dennis_i_created_infinity_train_ama/ Role in Infinity Train Tulip Olsen is an intelligent and logical girl from North Branch, Minnesota, who boards the Infinity Train after running away from home to attend a game design summer camp in Oshkosh, Wisconsin after issues from her parents' divorce prevent either from being willing to take her themselves.https://www.bubbleblabber.com/season-review-infinity-train-season- one/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-08-08/infinity- train-owen-dennis Ashley Johnson voiced Tulip in the series In Book One, she is accompanied by a small robot named One-One she encounters in a meadow on the train, and later by Atticus, a corgi and king of Corginia,http://www.amboyguardian.com/2019/08/23/miniseries-review-infinity- train/ and even later still briefly by her reflection, who later becomes known as \\"MT\\" (Mirror Tulip). Ultimately, Tulip returns One-One to his rightful position as the train's conductor in place of the usurper Amelia, teaching both the meaning of therapy and potential to grow after realising her own faults as a person. In Book Two, Tulip is infrequently mentioned in reference to her former reflection MT, later known as Lake, who is being sought out by Agents Mace and Sieve of the Reflection Police, whom Tulip had previously saved her from in freeing her from the mirror world in \\"The Chrome Car\\", in addition in conversations between MT and Jesse Cosay. Tulip met One-One while passing through freight cars. They overall have a good relationship, with One- One accompanying her across the train. Owen states that One-One, and its dual personalities, are there to balance out Tulip's own mood.http://www.noreruns.net/2020/04/18/digital-review-infinity-train-book- one/ Though initially apathetic to Atticus, she eventually warms up to him, even going out of her way to help him, and his people, in their plight, showing concern for him, shouting out his name when the Steward flicks Atticus towards a rock wall, exposing her location to the Steward. Tulip is shown to be very accepting of her reflection wanting to be her own person upon discovering them to be alive, bringing her into the prime world and allowing them to live their own life.https://janmakshar.co.in/infinity-train-review- book-1-the-perennial-child-part-2/ References External links * Official website of Infinity Train ‚Äì Cartoon Network * Official website of Infinity Train ‚Äì HBO Max Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2019 Category:Fictional explorers Category:Fictional programmers Category:Fictional amateur detectives Category:Fictional characters based on real people Category:Fictional characters from Minnesota Category:Animated human characters Category:Female characters in animation Category:Cartoon Network Studios characters Category:Infinity Train ","title":"Tulip Olsen"},{"id":"65263016","text":"Waverly J.

Whilst serving the US Army in the United Kingdom he attended university courses at the University of Oxford, University of Bristol and University of Edinburgh. At nineteen years old, Person was sent to New Guinea as part of the segregated, all-Black 93rd Infantry Division. He was eventually promoted to First Sergeant. As nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Person found himself onboard a boat to mainland Japan. The soldiers had not been told that the Japanese were about to surrender, and headed toward the area ready to mount an invasion. When Person and the 93rd Infantry Division arrived, they were told the would have to wait for white soldiers to go first. Person raised his hand, 'and told the captain, ‚ÄúThose bullets they‚Äôre firing at us don‚Äôt have white and black on them. They‚Äôll kill anybody that‚Äôs in their way,‚Äù'. In between his military service, Person returned to Saint Paul's College, where he studied mathematics. Although he was interested in research, he did not have the finances to continue his education beyond his bachelor's degree.  Research and career  After completing his degree in mathematics, Person joined the United States Department of Commerce as a physical science technician. In the late 1950s the Department of Commerce was responsible for monitoring earthquake activity. He used a seismograph that was set up in the lobby of the Herbert C. Hoover Building. Person was responsible for the maintenance of the seismograph, and changed the rotating drums that recorded the seismic activity. Person first became involved with science communication in the lobby of the Commerce building, telling the curious people who crowded around the seismograph about earthquakes. He achieved his professional status in geophysics after the 1964 Alaska earthquake. Geophysicist Waverly Person (left) reads the time of first arrival of the P wave from a seismogram In 1973 Person helped to establish the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), which relocated earthquake monitoring out of the Department of Commerce and into its own building in Golden, Colorado. After five years at the center, Person was promoted to Chief, and responsible for designing the scientific research programme of the NEIC, as well as interacting with the media. He was the first African American to hold such a senior position in the United States Department of the Interior, and maybe the first African American professional in earthquake seismology. In 1988 Person was awarded the Special Achievement Award of the National Association of Government Communicators in honour of his success in dealing with the media, and in 1991 the Boulder County Multicultural Award. Person was also responsible for the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America Seismological Notes.

The class is a modification of the MILGEM project Ada-class to facilitate requirements of the Pakistan Navy for air defense. Development On July 5, 2018, Pakistani military's ISPR announced that a Turkish company had won the bid to produce four MILGEM project corvettes for the Pakistan Navy. Turkish Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli described the deal as \\"the largest defense export of Turkey in one contract.\\" Defense media later reported that the prime contractor is Turkey's ASFAT, and Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works and Istanbul Naval Shipyard will provide their shipbuilding capacities. By September 2018, more details revealed that corvettes for the Pakistan Navy will have CODAD propulsion system instead of CODAG, thus increasing sea endurance from 10 to 15 days. The lead ship is planned to be constructed in 54 months, and the remaining ships will be constructed in 60, 66, and 72 months, respectively. During IDEAS 2018, Pakistan Navy officials stated that under the agreement, the fourth ship will be entirely designed and constructed in Pakistan, which will become the first Jinnah-class frigate. This encourages the idea that the fourth ship will spur a new line of frigates. Coinciding with the commissioning ceremony of TCG Kƒ±nalƒ±ada attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the steel cutting ceremony for the lead MILGEM ship of the Pakistan Navy was simultaneously held in Tuzla, Istanbul on September 29, 2019.

Characteristics The Pakistani Jinnah class is designated as a frigate with a displacement of more than 2,800 tons. Pakistan initially ordered four ships, of which three would have been regular Ada-class corvettes while the fourth one would have been a modified and subsequently classified as frigates.

Building  Ground and first floor The current castle has a rather illogical form. The core is formed by a seemingly very large main building 'glued' to a gate building of the same height. The core makes a very defendable impression, but together with some other buildings, it is on an island way too large to makes sense from a defensive point of view. This suggests that the castle is on the outer bailey of a preceding castle. The gate building probably dates from the early fifteenth century. The main building with the overhanging towers, just west of the gate, seems a single 4 windows wide structure, but this is not the case. In fact the part with the two windows directly below and between the overhanging towers belongs to the original main building, and probably dates from 1504-1509. The part immediately adjacent to the west is an early nineteenth century regularization of some earlier parts, and contains part of a Gothic tower of unknown date. The wide part of the main building directly behind these two parts, and the partly octogonal tower on the courtyard probably also date from 1504-1509. The west wing on the north side is of a later date. The heavily changed east wing dates from the seventeenth century. The orangery on the courtyard is of a still later date. Perhaps an archaeological investigation might one day give more certainty about the earliest phases and strange composition of the castle.  History  = The Lords of Vught = Maurick Castle is situated on an island in a dead meander of the Dommel. Originally, it was just across the harbor of Vught, which was one the most important trading stations in Brabant before 's-Hertogenbosch was founded. The founders were the Lords of Vught. When the territory was later mentioned for the first time, it was said to include a hill, later even a hill with a house on it. Therefore there might have been motte-and-bailey predecessor of the current castle. = Liescep and Van Maurick family = The Liescep family from 's-Hertogenbosch are the first known owners of the site. John Liescep (?-1352) son of Gijsbrecht Liescep was mentioned as a landowner owning a hill in 1312. In 1355 his son Gijsbrecht Liescep (?- c 1374) was mentioned as owning some land with a hill near Vught. There was no mention of a building on this hill, but this is not necessary for it to have been a motte-and-bailey castle. Gijsbrecht left his possessions to his sister Catherina Liescep (?-1383/1384). She left it to her niece Catherina van Aelst (?-1420), married to Hendrick van Maurick (1345-1399) a knight from Maurik in Gelderland. In 1421 their daughter Katheline was mentioned as owner of a hill with a house on it in Vught. In 1429 the Maurick's sold the castle. = The first stone keep = The side that has the remnants of the Gothic tower In 1429 Godscalc Roesmont, member of the council of ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch bought the castle. In 1443 Hendrick van Vladeracken (?-1464) became the new owner. His son Deynalt van Vladeracken sold it on the day he inherited Maurick. The first stone castle, or rather stone keep (a habitable tower-like house) was probably built by Godscalc Roesmont from 1430 and 1436, because in those years he ordered 44,000 and 25,000 bricks in Orthen. Even this is not exact, because the brick might also have been used for nearby Muizerik manor. It is tempting to assume that the motte-and-bailey castle is the same as the current castle. This is probably not the case, because the current terrain misses a high hill. There are reasons to suppose that the 'motte' was on a small island just north of the current island. This motte might then have been lowered after construction of the current castle on its outer bailey. This would also explain the strange situation of the current castle at the fringe of a large island. The walls of the current castle have a maximum width of 60 cm. This is inline with the castle being a manor built by a city dweller like Godscalc Roesmont. The maximum width also meant that it could not withstand a siege. Therefore the current castle does not qualify as a true castle, but only as a so-called 'moated site'. Maurick could not withstand a siege, but with its wide moat and solid buildings, it was defensible against enemies that did not come up with siege weapons. However, even this limited defendability would count for nothing if an enemy could install himself on a close by motte. I.e. constructing the current castle would require the removal of a supposed nearby motte. = The Heym family = Maurick Castle 1701-1759 The exterior form of the current castle is generally attributed to sixteenth century construction work ordered by the Heym family. The Heym coat of arms is cemented in the southern facade of one the main buildings, and has been there for centuries. In 1504-1509 the castle was altered by Jan Heyns, one of the architects of St. John's Cathedral in 's-Hertogenbosch. This is proven by the fact that Heym ordered many construction materials at the workshop which also provided these for the St. John, and that Jan Heyns paid for some of these, proving his involvement. The problem is that this fact is/was often used to claim that Jan Heyns built the current castle. A clear source for such a claim is missing. Castle gate and facade with Heym coat of arms (the six pointed star) In 1464 Knight Goessen Heym (?-1470) bought the castle. He was a member of the city council of 's-Hertogenbosch, and receiver of the states in the 's-Hertogenbosch quarter. The rich Heym family kept the castle in its possession over multiple generations, and so it was often referred to as Heym Manor (Dutch: Heymhuizinghe). In 1543 a Gelderland army led by Maarten van Rossum marched into Brabant, reaching as far as Antwerp. It burned down Vught on 26 juli 1543, but not Maurick castle. The defenses of 's-Hertogenbosch were led by Aert Heym (c. 1494-1562). Some say that he had an agreement with Van Rossum to spare the castle. On the other hand Van Heurn supposed that Heym kept his castle by garrisoning it with some soldiers from the city. Of course the likelihood of either explanation depends on how strong the castle was at the time, and whether Van Rossum had siege weapons. A later Aert Heym (?-1612) twice had to leave the castle because Maurice, Prince of Orange used it as his headquarters during his failed sieges of 's-Hertogenbosch. During the 1629 Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange used the castle as his headquarters. There is an anecdote about the dining table of Frederick Henry getting hit by a cannon ball while he was having lunch, and the prince complaining about this to the commander of 's-Hertogenbosch. The presence of Constantijn Huygens during the siege is a bit more relevant. He described his pleasant stay in a poem that describes the castle and grounds. After 1629 the castle was in an area under control of the Dutch Republic. The Catholic elite was not expropriated, but it was excluded from office, leading to a severe decrease in its income. In 1680 his financial situation forced Hendrick Heym (?-c 1680) to sell the castle. = Van Beresteyn family (1680-1883)= Castle gate with Beresteyn arms on the left, right that of Bruhl Thomas van Beresteyn (1647-1708) The Beresteyn family is especially important for Maurick Castle. The Beresteyn family originated from Amsterdam and Delft, and chose the Protestant side. They became rich as traders and as officials of the Dutch East India Company. Christiaen van Beresteyn (1616 - 23 June 1680) studied in Leiden, and moved to 's-Hertogenbosch. The fact that Catholics were barred from office enabled him to he become pensionary of ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch and Lord of Geffen. On 24 May 1645 he married Jacqueline Brouart (1627-1691). On 23 May 1680 Maurick was bought by the Van Beresteyn family, which kept the castle as their summer residence. Christiaen's son Thomas van Beresteyn (1647-1708) became the next Lord of the manor after the death of his mother. Thomas was a captain in the army, steward of ecclesial goods in Kempenland and Oisterwijk and member of the council of ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch. Thomas was first married to Dina Cornelia Tromp (1657-1699), a granddaughter of Maarten Tromp, second to Johanna Catharina de Groot (1664-1729), a granddaughter of Hugo Grotius. Thomas was succeeded by a long line of Beresteyn's with legal schooling: Maarten Cornelis van Beresteyn (1695-1734), Christiaan Paulus van Beresteyn (1705-1758) and Catharina Wilhelmina Bruhl (1723-1794), Gijsbert van Beresteyn (1749-1810). The next generation was elevated to the Dutch nobility. When Jonkheer Gijsbert van Beresteyn (1804-1884) died Maurick Castle was auctioned. In 1883 Adolph Joannes Mathias Mulder (1856-1936) was tasked to take measurements and make accurate drawings of Maurick castle. Mulder was a specialist in his work, and so the drawings of 1883 are very reliable. Splinter describes that during the Beresteyn period there were three major phases of changes to the building: 1) The Gothic tower was shortened and the extension over the moat was removed, probably soon after the Beresteyn's took over. (From old pictures this Gothic tower seems to have been the highest part of the castle before it was demolished. Today a fragment is visible in west facing wall.) 2) The west wing facade on the south side was changed so it seemed to be similar to the part with the small overhanging towers, and the whole was plastered to appear as a classic manor. These changes probably took place soon after 1814. 3) The facade of the western wing was altered. This probably happened after 1840. = Van Lanschot = In 1884 Maurick Castle was bought by Augustinus J.A. van Lanschot (1834-1919). The Van Lanschot's were a banking family. Augustinus had the castle renovated, and used it as a summer residence. On the death of Augustinus his son August W.J. van Lanschot (1867-1923), inherited the castle. He was mayor of Vught from 1899 to 1923. His widow Gertrude Lagasse de Locht (1886-1963) then lived on Maurick till her death. The renovation by Van Lanschot was done in 1891-1892 by Lambertus Christianus Hezenmans (1841-1909), a well known architect for restorations. One of the most important changes was the removal of the yellow plaster. The western wing was made somewhat higher and got a stepped gable. The roof was changed in some places, and the dormers got pointed roofs creating a more medieval look. The two towers of the gate building were heightened a bit creating a more irregular picture. The eastern wing also got a different roof and a stepped gable. Later Eduard Cuypers (1859-1927) was tasked to make some minor changes. = Commercial use = The Van Lanschot family sold the castle to N.V. tot Exploitatie van het Landgoed Maurick, which started a hotel and restaurant in the castle. Later it became a restaurant only. In 2007 N.V. Monumenten Fonds Brabant, a local organization to protect monuments became owner. Monumenten Fonds Brabant aims to finance her task by finding suitable users for her buildings. This again became a restaurant, the restaurant went broke in 2015, but was followed by another restaurant. The romantic location makes that many weddings use the castle.  Park  Next to the castle is an estate of 23 hectares called landgoed \\"Maurick\\". It is owned by BV tot Exploitatie van het Landgoed Maurick and is situated on the edge of the Dommel valley. There is a forest of elms and ashes on the higher parts, and a carr on the lower part. It has one of the largest grey heron colonies of the Netherlands  The Maurick Rembrandts  Probably Cornelis van Beresteyn (1586‚Äì1638) in 1632 Probably Corvina van Hofdyck (1602‚Äì1667) The rich Pauwels van Beresteyn (1548-1625) had at least two sons: Gijsbert (1576-1641) was the oldest. He continued his father's business and became an official for the Delft office of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC). His oldest Christiaen van Beresteyn (1616 - 23 June 1680) moved south and founded the Van Beresteyn branch that would later settle on Maurick Castle (cf. above). Pauwels second son Cornelis van Beresteyn (1586-1638) became mayor of Delft, and was an official for the Delft office of the VOC. He married Corvina van Hoffdijck, a marriage which made him Lord of Middelharnis. Their son Zacharias van Beresteyn van Hoffdijck (1623-1679) was successful in Delft politics, and became a member of the Gecommitteerde Raden of Holland. In 1674 Zacharias van Beresteyn married Agneta Deutz (1633-1692). They got one child, Cornelis Joseph van Beresteyn, baptized 26 December 1675. Cornelis died in childhood, and was buried on 24 February 1689. Agneta herself died on 13 February 1692. She left an estate worth 340,000 guilders, which was used to found Deutzen Hofje. The two Rembrandts probably depict Cornelis van Beresteyn (1586‚Äì1638) and Corvina van Hofdyck (1602‚Äì1667). If that is the case, the paintings probably came to Maurick Castle after that of the branch family became extinct on the death of Agneta Deutz on 13 February 1692. Jonkheer Gijsbert van Beresteyn was the last Van Beresteyn living on the castle. He died on 26 January 1884. When the Van Beresteyn family prepared to auction the castle and the works of art it contained, the two painting were identified as made by Rembrandt. In an 1884 auction the two paintings did not get sold. A family member made a high bid, but could not get it financed. At an auction in 1887 the paintings were bought by Jonkheer J. van Beresteyn from Gorssel. Via later transactions, the paintings ended up in the collection of Louisine Havemeyer and her husband Henry Osborne Havemeyer. They gave the Rembrandts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they now reside.

Career Van de Graaff followed in his father's footsteps and entered the Dutch cavalry but was in the engineering corps when he was appointed engineer extraordinary at 's-Hertogenbosch in April 1759. In 1784 he left for the Cape Colony as an engineer 2nd Class with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, as comptroller-general of fortifications in the province of Holland. Van de Graaff was appointed Governor at the Cape with the intention of making the colonists feel more satisfied. He arrived with his family in Table Bay on 22 January 1785 and officially took over from Joachim van Plettenberg on 14 February and quickly began to make sweeping changes in the defence system at the Cape. To improve the fortifications, two batteries were erected at Rogge Bay and additions were made to the Chavonnes Battery. The building of these was supervised by the engineers Louis Thibault and D. M. Barbier. They were also responsible for drafting the plans, and a new hospital at the Cape was commenced under their guidance. Hester Cornelia Reynet, the wife of Cornelis Jacob van de Graeff Van de Graaff started a military training institution, aiming to improve the artillery service and protect the Cape. Thibault also lectured in military science and mathematics at the military school. The defence system of the northern and eastern frontiers and the local government of the Colony were strengthened by the establishment in 1786 of the Graaff- Reinet district, named after Van de Graaff and his wife. However, the economy at the Cape Colony deteriorated and although Van de Graaff lived in luxury, inflation soared and Van de Graaff as Governor, issued so much paper money that the quantity multiplied five times in as many years. The money was used to finance the building of the hospital and the fortifications. In 1785 a delegation of Cape Patriots was sent to the Netherlands to plead the cause of the colonists before the States General as the people of the Cape felt they were not getting the necessary support from the Governor. In April 1786, a petition was filed on this, but the States General was unwilling to interfere with the affairs of the VOC. On 14 October 1790, the Lords XVII decided to recall Van de Graaff and on 24 June 1791 he and his family, left the Cape. Personal Van de Graaff was the eldest son of Sebastiaan van de Graaff, a major in the Dutch Cavalry Regiment of Hop, and his wife, Geertruid van Vinceler. He married Hester Cornelia Reynet in Gouda during October 1766. Two sons and two daughters were born from the marriage. Van de Graaff resigned from the Dutch military service in 1795, at the time of the revolution in the Netherlands, and fled to Prussia, where he later died.

Life Giovanni Francesco Negroni was born in Genua on 3 October 1629 to an senatorial family. He graduated in utroque iure in Perugia. He took up a career in the administration of the Papal States: governor of Terni in 1658, Vice-legato of Romagna in 1661, Governor of Jesi in 1663, Governor of Orvieto in 1664, Governor of Spoleto in 1665 and in the same year he was appointed Protonotary apostolic. Governor of Perugia in 1668. In 1669 or 1670 he purchased the title of clerk of the Apostolic Camera in Rome. In October 1679 in Rome he took the offices of Prefect of the Annona with the responsibility for the grain supply to the city of Rome, and in 1681 he became General Treasurer of the Apostolic Camera, working with Pope Innocent XI to reduce the expenses of the Papal States, and in that position he succeded to perform a restructuring of the debt of the State. On 2 September 1686, Pope Innocent XI appointed him Cardinal deacon with the title of San Cesareo de Appia. On 7 July 1687 he was appointed bishop of Faenza. His episcopal consecration followed on 20 July in Rome by the hands of cardinal Marcantonio Barbarigo. On 10 November 1687 he was appointed Legate (i.e. Governor) of Bologna. This office, as usually, lasted three years. Negroni paid and organized the renovation of the chapel of S. Francesco Saverio in the Church of the Ges√π, the main church of the Jesuits, also to reaffirm his status of Cardinal Protector of the Jesuits. During the 1691 papal conclave, Negroni wrote a manifesto for the faction of the zelanti cardinals, who desired that the election of the Pope were free from nepotism and from the interferences of France, Spain and Holy Empire. In the same conclave, with compromising documents he stopped the candidature of Paluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni, the Cardinal-Nephew to Pope Clement X. As bishop of Faenza he lived in that town only occasionally, and in 1694 he held a diocesan synod. On 2 January 1696 he was promoted to Cardinal priest with the title of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. He resigned the bishopric of Faenza on 11 November 1697, passing the last years in Rome, where he died on 1 January 1713. He was buried in the chapel of S.

It is managed by the Irish National Parks & Wildlife Service. Features The Raven Nature Reserve was legally protected as a national nature reserve by the Irish government in 1983. In 1986, the site was also declared Ramsar site number 333. The area is also a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area. The land on which The Raven is located was originally a long narrow sand spit which sheltered the entrance of the Wexford Harbour. When the North Slob was created in the mid 19th century, the area was landlocked on its western side. The name Raven comes from the Irish Rabhainn meaning spade shaped piece of land, which refers to the sand spit and its former shape. The area is now one part of a large system of sand dunes, with lagoons and a sand bar on the southern tip. Along with the North Slob, The Raven is home to 35% of the world's population of Greenland and White-fronted Geese who over-winter there. The birds feed at the Slob during the day, and roost on The Raven's sand bar at night. It is also home to large numbers of wading birds who live there year round. Other birds recorded there include crossbills and little terns. There is a rich flora on the reserve with rare species such as round-leaved wintergreen, which is not found anywhere else in Ireland. A wide variety of butterflies can be seen in the reserve also. It is thought that the family who owned the land during the 19th century, the Tooles of Curracloe House, began planting the trees on the site, which today is predominately conifers such as Corsican Pine. There is a population of red squirrels on the reserve, supported by the pine cones of the tree plantation. Due to the presence of pine martens, grey squirrels have not established there.

Volcanic islands and volcanoes on land frequently undergo large landslides/collapses, which have been documented in Hawaii for example. A recent example is Anak Krakatau, which collapsed in 2018 to cause the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami that claimed hundreds of fatalities. Steven N. Ward and Simon Day in a 2001 research article proposed that a Holocene change in the eruptive activity of Cumbre Vieja volcano and a fracture on the volcano that formed during an eruption in 1949 may be the prelude to a giant collapse. They estimated that such a collapse could cause tsunamis across the entire North Atlantic and severly impact countries as far as North America. Later research has debated whether the tsunami would still have a significant size far away from La Palma and whether the collapse is likely to take place in a single failure, with evidence indicating that most collapses of Canary Islands collapses took place as multistage events that are not as effective at creating tsunamis. Other volcanoes across the world are also at risk of causing such tsunamis.  Sector collapses and tsunamis caused by them  Giant landslides/collapses of ocean island volcanoes were first described in 1964 in Hawaii and are now known to happen in almost each ocean basin. Volcanoes grow in size and thus eventually become unstable and collapse, generating landslides and collapses such as the failure of the Mount St. Helens in 1980 and many others. In the Hawaiian Islands, collapses with volumes of over have been identified. A number of such landslides have been identified in the Canary Islands, especially in the more active volcanoes El Hierro, La Palma and Tenerife where about 14 such events are recorded through their deposits. They mostly take the form of debris flows with volumes of that emanate from an amphitheatre-shaped depression on the volcanic island and come to rest on the seafloor at depth. They do not appear to form through individual collapses; multi-stage failures lasting hours or days appear to be more common as has been inferred from the patterns of landslide-generated turbidite deposits in the Agadir Basin north of the Canary Islands. The most recent such event took place at El Hierro 15,000 years ago and was later re- dated to have occurred between 87,000¬±8,000 (margin of uncertainty) and 39,000¬±13,000 years ago. Many processes are involved in the onset of volcano instability and the eventual failure of the edifice. Mechanisms that destabilize volcanic edifices to the point of collapse include inflation and deflation of magma chambers during the entry of new magma, intrusion of cryptodomes and dykes, and instability of slopes under loading from lava flows and oversteepened lava domes. Periodic collapses have been found at some volcanoes, such as at Augustine and Volcan de Colima. Shield volcanoes have different mechanical properties than stratovolcanoes as well as flatter slopes and undergo larger collapses than the latter. Finally, the mechanical stability both of the volcanic edifice and the underlying basement and the influence of climate and sea level changes play a role in volcano stability. = Tsunami hazards = Large collapses on volcanoes have generated tsunamis, of which about 1% relates to volcanic collapse; both small collapses and earthquake-linked landslides that took place in historical times generated tsunamis. The 1998 Papua New Guinea earthquake in particular drew attention to this hazard. The most recent such tsunami is the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, which was caused by a flank collapse of Anak Krakatau and caused at least 437 fatalities. The possibility of a large collapse of this volcano causing a tsunami was known already before the 2018 event. Other contemporaneous examples include the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake, the 1958 Lituya Bay tsunami, a 2002 tsunami at Stromboli that caused severe damage to coastal settlements, the 1888 tsunami caused by the Ritter Island collapse which killed about 3000 people and is the largest historical tsunami-forming collapse with a volume of , and the 1792 Shimabara collapse of Unzen volcano in Japan which claimed 4,000 or 14,538 victims. In total, volcanically generated tsunamis are responsible for about 20% of all fatalities related to volcanic eruptions. Prehistoric landslides that caused tsunamis include the Storegga slide 8,200 years ago, a submarine landslide off Norway that generated a tsunami recorded from geological evidence in the Faroe Islands, Norway and Scotland. The landslide has been modelled as a retrogressive failure that moved at a rate of . Another landslide-induced tsunami inundated Santiago, Cape Verde, 73,000 years ago after a collapse of the neighbouring Fogo volcano. More controversial is the evidence of past landslide-induced tsunamis at Kohala and Lanai in the Hawaiian Islands and at Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, and other candidate deposits of landslide-induced tsunamis have been reported from Bermuda, Eleuthera, Mauritius, Rangiroa and Stromboli. The size of such tsunamis depends both on the geological details of the landslide (such as its Froude number) and also on assumptions about the hydrodynamics of the model used to simulate tsunami generation, thus they have a large margin of uncertainty. Generally, landslide-induced tsunamis decay more quickly with distance than earthquake-induced tsunamis, as the former, often having a dipole structure at the source, tend to spread out radially and has a shorter wavelength while the latter disperses little as it propagates away perpendicularly to the source fault. Testing whether a given tsunami model is correct is complicated by the rarity of giant collapses. The term \\"megatsunami\\" has been defined by media and has no precise definition, although it is commonly taken to refer to tsunamis over high.  Regional context: Cumbre Vieja and the Atlantic Ocean  Cumbre Vieja volcano lies on the southern third of La Palma (Canary Islands) and rises about above sea level and above the seafloor. It is the fastest growing volcano in the archipelago and thus dangerous in terms of collapses and landslides. Several collapses took place since the Pliocene, followed by the growth of Cumbre Vieja during the last 125,000 years. The last eruption of La Palma was in 1971, the most recent subaerial eruption in the Canary Islands. During the Holocene volcanic activity on Cumbre Vieja has become concentrated along a north-south axis, which may reflect an incipient detachment fault under the volcano. During the 1949 eruption a long normal fault developed along the crest of Cumbre Vieja; it has been inactive since then and prior eruptions did not form such faults, which do not have the appearance of graben faults. Geodesy has not identified ongoing movement of the flank. Unlike on Hawaii, flank movements at Canary Islands appear to occur mainly during volcanic episodes. Tsunamis are less common in the Atlantic Ocean than in the Pacific or the Indian oceans, but they have been observed e.g after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Apart from fault lines, submarine volcanoes such as Kick'em Jenny and landslides are sources of tsunamis in the Atlantic. Tsunamis are not just known from the sea; the Vajont Dam disaster in 1963 claimed 2000 fatalities and was caused by lake-level tsunami and evidence of past tsunamis is recorded from Lake Tahoe.  Models  = Model by Ward and Day 2001 = Ward and Day 2001 estimated that the unstable part of Cumbre Vieja would be at least wide in north-south direction. In light of the behaviour of other documented sector collapses such as at Mount St. Helens, the headscarp of the unstable part of Cumbre Vieja is likely east from the 1949 fault and the toe of the sector lies at depth below sea level. Bathymetric observations west of La Palma support this interpretation. They had not enough information with which to estimate the thickness of the block but assumed that it would have a volume of about and the shape of a wedge, comparable to the Cumbre Nueva giant landslide 566,000 years ago also on La Palma. The authors used linear wave theory to estimate the tsunami induced by the simulated Cumbre Vieja. They used a scenario of a collapse of that moves at a rate of about on top of a layer of mud or landslide breccia, which lubricate its movement, and eventually spreads to cover a jug-shaped area of . Ignoring that the landslide excavates part of the flank of Cumbre Vieja, thus assuming that it does not contribute to any tsunami generation, they estimated the following timing of the tsunami: * 2 Minutes: A thick dome of water rises above the landslide. * 5 Minutes: The dome collapses to a height of as it advances by ; additionally, wave valleys form. * 10 Minutes: The landslide is now over. Waves reaching heights of hit the three western Canary Islands. * 15 Minutes-60 Minutes: high waves hit Africa. A wide train of waves advances across the Atlantic. * 3-6 Hours: The waves hit South America and Newfoundland, reaching heights of and , respectively. Spain and England are partially protected by La Palma, thus tsunami waves there only reach . * 9 Hours: Waves approach Florida; they are not expected to grow farther as they hit the coast. France and the Iberian Peninsula would be affected as well. Further, the authors concluded that the size of the tsunami roughly scales with the product of the landslide spee and its volume. They suggested that traces of past such tsunamis may be found in the southeastern United States, on the continental shelf, in northeast Brazil, in the Bahamas, western Africa. = Later models = Mader 2001 employed a shallow water code that includes friction and the Coriolis force. Assuming shallow-water behaviour of the wave even with runup the eventual tsunami heights in the US and the Caribbean would not exceed and in Africa and Europe it would not be higher than . Mader 2001 also estimated that dispersion along the US coast could reduce tsunami amplitude to less than . Gisler, Weaver and Gittings 2006 used public domain bathymetric information and the so-called \\"SAGE hydrocode\\" to simulate the tsunami stemming from variously shaped landslides. The landslides generate a single wave that eventually detaches from the landslide as the latter slows down. The waves have shorter wavelengths and periods than teletsunamis and thus do not spread as effectively as the latter away from the source and decay away roughly with the inverse of the distance. Such tsunamis would be a greater danger to the Canary Islands, the eastern Lesser Antilles, Iberia, Morocco and northeastern South America than to North America where they would be only a few centimetres high. L√∏vholt, Pedersen and Gisler in 2008 published another study that employed the worst-case landslide scenario of Ward and Day 2001, but used hydrodynamic modelling that accounts for dispersion, non-linear effects and the deformation of the landslide material itself to simulate waves generated by such a collapse. In this model, the landslide had a volume of and a maximum speed of . It generates a high leading wave that eventually separates from the landslide, while turbulent flow behind the slide generates lower waves. Overall, a complex wave field develops with a sickle-shaped front wave that is over high when it reaches a radius of . The waves do not decay at a constant rate with distance, with the crestal wave decaying slightly faster than 1/distance while the trailing wave decays slightly more slowly. Thus at distance the trailing waves can become higher than the leading wave, especially the waves propagating west display this behaviour. Undulating bores also develop, a factor not commonly considered in tsunami models. In the L√∏vholt, Pedersen and Gisler 2008 model, the impact in the Canary Islands would be quite severe, with the tsunami reaching heights of over , threatening even inland valleys and towns and hitting the two largest cities of the islands (Santa Cruz and Las Palmas) badly. The impact in Florida would not be as severe as in the Ward and Day 2001 model by a factor of 2-3 but wave heights of several metres would still occur around the North Atlantic. Off the US coast, wave amplitude would reach . Abadie et al. 2009 simulated both the most realistic landslide geometry and the tsunamis that would result from it near its source. They concluded that most realistic volumes would be for a small collapse and for a large collapse. The initial height of the wave depends strongly on the viscosity of the landslide and can exceed . L√∏vholt, Pedersen and Glimsdal 2010 noted that landslide-generated tsunamis can have a leading wave smaller than following waves, requiring a dispersive wave model. They simulated inundation in Cadiz resulting from a collapse at La Palma. The found runup of about and the possible development of undular bores. Abadie, Harris and Grilli 2011 employed three-dimensional simulations with the hydrodynamic simulator \\"THETIS\\" to reproduce the tsunamis induced by failures of , , and . These volumes were taken from studies on the stability of La Palma's western flank, while the reflects worst-case scenarios from earlier tsunami studies at Cumbre Vieja. The landslide is directed southwestward and induces a wave train, with the collapse having a maximum wave height of . At El Hierro the tsunami can shoal and rise to a height of , while the wave train surrounds La Palma and continues eastward with a height of . Zhou et al. 2011 used numerical simulations to model various tsunamis, including a scenario resulting from a mass failure at La Palma. It assumes a smaller volume of as the collapse hits only the western flank and does not assume a southwest- directed propagation direction, thus increasing the hazard to the US coast. The resulting tsunami approaches the US coast between 6-8 hours after the collapse, in a north-to-south fashion. Waves grow due to shoaling as they approach the continental shelf but later decline due to increased bottom friction and eventually reach heights of when they come ashore. The impact of undular bore formation on runup is unclear. Abadie et al. 2012 simulated both the development of waves using dispersive models that include non-linear effects, and the behaviour of the landslide generating them through slope stability and material strength models. They considered both volumes of , obtained from research on the stability of the flank of Cumbre Vieja, as well as volumes of as hypothesized by the original Ward and Day 2001 study. The slide has a complex acceleration behaviour and most of the waves are formed during a short period early in the slide where the Froude number briefly exceeds 1; the initial wave can reach a height of - and eventually wave trains are formed, which are diffracted around the southern tip of La Palma and go on to hit the other Canary Islands. With increasing volume of the slides, the wavelength becomes shorter and the amplitude higher, yielding steeper waves. Abadie et al. 2012 estimated a fast decay of the waves with distance but cautioned that since their model was not appropriate to use for simulating far-field wave propagation the decay may be exaggerated. In the Canary Islands, inundation would reach a height of on La Palma; even for a slide would reach heights of in the city of Santa Cruz de La Palma (population 18,000) while the largest city of La Palma (Los Llanos de Aridane, population 20,000) may be spared. The waves would take approximately one hour to propagate through the archipelago, and important cities in the entire Canary Islands would be hit by substantial tsunamis irrespective of the landslide size. Tehranirad et al. 2015 modelled the impact both of a worst-case landslide and of a more realistic collapse on Ocean City, Maryland, the surrounding area, Europe, Africa and the Canary Islands, using the \\"THETIS\\" and \\"FUNWAVE-TD\\" hydrodynamical models. They found that for a larger volume, the leading wave is both larger and forms farther away from the island. For a volume of , the tsunami hits Africa after 1-2 hours, followed by Europe between 2-3 hours, the Central Atlantic between 4-5 hours and the US continental shelf between 7-9 hours. At the continental shelf, the wave train slows down and the number of main waves changes. Bathymetry, such as the presence of submarine topography, alters the behaviour of the wave. In the scenario after slightly over 8 hours from collapse tsunami waves reach the areas offshore the US coast, where their height decays as they traverse the continental shelf. The eventual wave heights at the depth contour are about for the collapse and for the collapse; impact is worst in North Carolina but also New York and Florida are impacted even if refraction around the Hudson River Canyon mitigates the impact in New York City. In Europe, tsunami waves arrive after 1-2 hours; even with a smaller collapse of impact around Coimbra and Lisbon is severe with waves of height, as Europe is closer to La Palma. Ward and Day 2006 indicated that the combined effects of several wave trains may amplify the tsunami impact over that of a single wave. Research by Frohlich et al. 2009 on boulders emplaced on Tongatapu endorsed the hypothesis of large landslide-induced tsunamis and Ramalho et al. 2015 identified evidence of a megatsunami, implying a single step collapse, caused by the collapse of Fogo volcano in the Cape Verde islands.  Criticism  The findings of Ward and Day 2001 have gained considerable attention, amplified by increased concerns after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake about the hazards posed by tsunamis, and in turn increased awareness of megatsunami risks and phenomena. The coverage of the risk of a collapse gained criticism for exaggeration, in particular the coverage in North American and English media. They have triggered debate about their validity and the landslide and wave scenarios employed. Various models with different physical specifications have been used to simulate the waves induced by such a landslide. Later estimates have questioned the assumptions made by Ward and Day 2001, mainly with regards to the following: * The authors employed a linear tsunami model that may not properly reflect non-linear processes such as wave breaking that could reduce the height of the resulting tsunami by a factor of about 10. Wave dispersion might also act to reduce tsunami height since the wave induced by the Ward and Day 2001 landslide behaves as a intermediate-water depth wave. * The estimated speed and acceleration of the landslide may be unrealistically high for the slopes it would move on, and this inadequate to establish effective coupling between the tsunami and the landslide. Later research has found evidence that sufficient speeds have been reached during collapses at other volcanoes. * The landslide modelled by Ward and Day 2001 may be implausibly thick given the known volumes of Canary Islands mega-landslides, and collapses may have occurred in multiple steps rather than a single failure or may have a smaller volume. The thickness of the landslide is a particular issue, as different estimates have been obtained at various volcanoes. Another issue is whether giant landslides occur as a single step failure (as argued for Hawaiian giant landslides) or multistage failures (as appears to be more common in the Canary Islands) and stacking in turbidite deposits generated by landslides are a reliable indicator that these landslides occurred in piecemeal fashion. In general, many of these studies have found lower wave heights at distance than the original Ward and Day 2001 paper. There are also questions about the southern limit of the width of the unstable zone, aabout whether creep might stabilize it and about whether it actually exists at all. = Probability = Humanity has never witnessed enormous collapses on La Palma and there is evidence that the western flank of La Palma is currently stable and a collapse in the near future unlikely. A worst-case scenario giant landslide like the one modelled by Ward and Day 2001 is a very low probability event, probably much less common than once per 100,000 years which is the probable occurrence rate of large landslides in the Canary Islands. A smaller landslide scenario, which Tehranirad et al. 2015 defined as \\"extreme credible worst case scenario\\", has a recurrence rate of about once every 100,000 years. Because of their low incidence probability, the hazard from large flank collapses at La Palma is considered to be low. Return periods are not the only factor involved in estimating risk, as the amount of damage done by an extreme event has to be considered. Globally, the return period of giant landslide-induced tsunamis may exceed one per 10,000 years.  Potential impact  A Cumbre Vieja landslide tsunami may constitute a threat to Brazil, Canada, Caribbean, Ireland, Morocco, the Northeastern United States, Portugal and the United Kingdom. The impact would not be limited to humans. Aside from the tsunami hazard, the impact of a large collapse on people living on the island would be severe. The communities of El Paso, Fuencaliente, Los Llanos and Tazecorte are located on the unstable block. Cumbre Vieja is largely unmonitored and a flank collapse may begin with little forewarning.  Other volcanoes with such threats  Other volcanoes in the world with such landslide risks include: * Anak Krakatau, which is quickly regrowing after its 2018 collapse. * Augustine. * Fogo and Santo Antao in the Cape Verde islands, although the latter is currently inactive and it is not clear whether the former, which underwent a past such collapse, has reached a critical size again. * Kick 'em Jenny in the Lesser Antilles. * Kilauea, where a mass movement took place in 2000. It was a slow movement but a sudden collapse could hit all of the Pacific Rim. * Kueishantao. * Monte Nuovo on Ischia, which might fail during renewed magmatic activity. Both the landslide itself (on Ischia) and tsunamis (Ischia and the coast of Campania) would be affected. * There is little known about the potential for such landslide-induced tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean, except for Hawaii. * A slump off Pico. * Stromboli. * Tenerife, which in case of a collapse during renewed mafic activity could impact the North Atlantic. While non-volcanic, tsunami threats from submarine landslides off the western Great Bahama Bank have been identified. They may impact The Bahamas, Cuba and Florida.

He was the first Swede and eighth European to cross Africa. Life Sten Edvard Gleerup was born on 13 June 1860 in Chicago. His father was Georg Josef Teodor Gleerup, a photographer in Chicago and then in Lund, and his mother was Wendela Sofia Hallstr√∂m. In 1879 he was appointed a lieutenant in the Southern Scanian Infantry Regiment. Gleerup joined the service of the Congo in 1883, and in 1884 was appointed head of the Kimpoko Station at Stanley Pool. He built a new station there. On 11 November 1884 Edmond Hanssens left L√©opoldville in an expedition with three steamers: the Royal, A.I.A. and En Avant. The members included Guillaume Casman, Charles Liebrechts and Camille Van den Plas. They stopped at Kimpoko to embark Gleerup, who had been appointed second to Arvid Wester at the Falls. They arrived at Equateur Station, where Alphonse van G√®le handed over command to Casman in a ceremony before the native chiefs. Van G√®le then left to visit the Falls accompanied by the intendant Van den Plas and Gleerup. He left the Equateur post on 20 November 1884. Well before reaching the Aruwimi River he noticed that the local people had been terrorized by a recent attack by the Arabs against the Basokos. The supply expedition continued on to Stanley Falls. The land upstream from the Aruwimi had all been deserted by the people, who had fled the Arabs. Soon after the expedition reached the Falls, Tippo-Tip sent his nephew Rachid to greet Van G√®le. Later that day Tippo-Tip himself visited Van G√®le and assured him he wanted cordial relations with the Europeans and would stop hunting for slaves. Van G√®le left Lieutenant Gleerup at the Falls to support Lieutenant Wester. Wester, with Louis-Gustave Amelot as deputy, had arrived in July 1884. Wester and Gleerup were to oversee the outermost station and both the most important and the most dangerous. The Arab leader Tippu Tip did not want European interference in the region and demanded that the station be evacuated, but Wester managed to establish good relations with Tippu Tip, and the station developed. After the end of his term of service, Gleerup accepted an offer to travel east to Zanzibar under the protection of the Arab chief. He left the station at the end of 1885 and reached Zanzibar at the end of June 1886. Gleerup thus became the eighth European and first Swede to cross Africa. Gleerup, Peter M√∂ller and Georg Pagels published Three years in the Congo: in 1887‚Äì88. In 1888 he married Augusta Juliana (Julie) Malm. In 1896 he was promoted to captain.

Greenway has covered conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan, Burma, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bosnia, and Croatia. His writing has also appeared in the New York Times, The New Yorker, the New York Review of Books, Atlantic Monthly, the Columbia Journalism Review, and la Repubblica. Greenway is currently a columnist for Foreign Affairs and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Early life and education Greenway was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935 to James Greenway and Helen Livingston Scott, the second of three children. His father, a member of the Lauder Greenway family, was a well known ornithologist and explorer who was a curator at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. Greenway attended the Milton School, then Yale University and Oxford University. After serving in the U.S. Navy for two years from 1960 - 1962, he began his career in journalism. Later in his career, Greeenway would be the recipient of both a Nieman Fellowship and a fellowship at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. Career Greenway started his career at Time Magazine in 1962. Greenway was interviewing W. Averell Harriman at the State Department on November 22, 1963 when reports started to come through that President President Kennedy had been shot. As the presidential pool were all in Dallas, Greenway was sent to the White House to cover the event there reporting that \\"No one around Kennedy thought to call the president's staff. For a moment the White House had become a backwater. Staffers were arguing over whether the White House flag should be lowered.\\" By the spring of 1967, he became a war correspondent for them in Indochina covering the Vietnam War in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. ‚ÄúIt was Vietnam that obsessed me then,‚Äù Greenway said. He acquired a reputation for being lucky at first, though that luck ran out in Hue during the Tet Offensive in February 1968 where, embroiled in battle, he wound up picking up an M-16 and firing at the enemy. Later in that same battle, Greenway and fellow journalists Charlie Mohr and Al Webb were carrying a wounded Marine to safety and Greenway was hit in the leg by fragments of an RPG. He, Mohr, and Webb were each awarded a Bronze Star for rescuing the Marine and saving his life. Greenway was promoted to the head of war reporting by Henry Luce in 1970. Due to Greenway's families wide-ranging network of friendships, he would find himself on unusual missions such as escorting his friend John le Carre around Southeast Asia on a research trip for what would become The Honourable Schoolboy. Greenway was also an friend of Sean Flynn and was with him when he decided to get an entire indigenous village in Papua New Guinea high on hash. The two men were also together in Cambodia in 1970 day Flynn and Dana Stone rode off -- never to be seen again. In 1972 Greenway left Time to work for the Washington Post in Washington. After some months, the Post named him as its bureau chief in Hong Kong, but he was soon sent to Saigon in early 1973. As the American participation was winding down, Greenway found opportunities to travel with fellow correspondents like Frances FitzGerald into the jungles of central Vietnam to interview Viet Cong guerilla leaders. Greenway would later report from Cambodia with Sydney Schanberg at the advent of the Killing Fields of the Khmer Rouge. He joined the Boston Globe in 1978 and tasked with building a foreign news service. He would go on to create bureaus in London, Tokyo, Canada, Moscow, Latin America and Jerusalem for the paper. At various times he was the foreign and national editor, in charge of the Globe's Washington bureau, and, towards the end, the editor-in-chief of the editorial page. During his tenure there, Greenway covered Anwar Sadat in Jerusalem; the 1982 Lebanon War and elements of the larger Lebanese Civil War; ethnic cleansing and genocide in the Balkans during the Yugoslav Wars; both Gulf Wars and civil wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Greenway has been a Bosch Fellow in Public Policy at the American Academy in Berlin and also been awarded their Edward Weintal Prize for diplomatic reporting.

The painting depicts a woman with blonde, worn-up hair and a purple dress staring dreamily into space, while smiling. The sitter was Maria S√®the, who belonged to an affluent musical family with an interest in the arts. In the painting, she is depicted sitting at a harmonium, but she's not playing it. The painting shows the influence of Seurat on van Rysselberghe, the latter's adoption of Seurat‚Äôs pointillism, and his rejection of Seurat‚Äôs style and simplification. Painting The paintings depicts Maria S√®the, who later married the modernist architect, painter, designer and exponent of Art Nouveau Henry Van de Velde, sitting on a chair while gazing dreamily off. The woman is smiling. She's sitting at a harmonium, but she's not playing it. The head of a cello rises up behind it. The harmonium, the cello and the work of art point the social status of the wealthy S√®the family and their musical interests. The painting is signed VTR at the top, along with the date of the portrait. Seurat‚Äôs influence and van Rysselberghe's style Van Rysselberghe, as a Belgian, was imbued with the portrait tradition of Dutch and Flemish masters, and as a 19th-century artist, he was attuned to the artistic tastes of the bourgeoisie. In 1886, Van Rysselberghe visited the Impressionist exhibition in Paris. There, he discovered the work of the French artist George Seurat, and thereupon embraced Neo-Impressionism. The Pointillists used a technique in which small, distinct dots of primary color are applied in patterns to form an image. The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Because of the way the human brain works, the viewer then perceives a secondary color. Placing red and yellow stipples next to each other, for instance, makes us see orange. The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.Vivien Greene, Divisionism, Neo-Impressionism: Arcadia & Anarchy, Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2007, Strict color theory and systematic method were applied less stringently after Seurat‚Äôs death. The brushwork became more personal and expressive. Color became increasingly important. There was more room for personal insight and a less analytical approach. In this way, Pointillism eventually led to the birth of 20th-century modernism. Van Rysselberghe painted little dots for expressive parts, such as hands and face. The rest of the work was done with larger touches. Further, he did not adopt Seurat‚Äôs style and simplification. Van Rysselberghe continued to work realistically and paid a lot of attention to volume, light and shadow. His pointillist paintings create a bright, almost luminous impression. In this instance, the purple of Maria S√®the's dress is overwhelming. Equally attractive is the blonde hair realized in yellow and orange, complementary colours of purple and blue.
