They were generally hired out for a few weeks at a time to theaters, mostly located in small midwestern towns that didn't have their own radio stations, to be used for special programs broadcast to the local community. However, if WMBH ever actually toured as a portable its career was brief, because by early June it was reported to be in Joplin,\\"Picher Locals: Pupils to Broadcast\\", Miami (Oklahoma) Daily News- Record, June 5, 1927, page 13. and a government notification reported that it was \\"no longer portable\\".\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 30, 1927, page 5.

He was one of the \\"Saints\\"' most loyal players ever. Playing career Bradford was born in Walsall and played his youth football with Bloxwich All Saints, before joining the Talbot Stead Tube works team (from which Ted Hough was signed in October 1921) where he was spotted by scouts from Southampton and offered a trial. After a successful trial he signed a professional contract in September 1922 but didn't make his first team debut until 18 April 1924 in a Second Division match at Crystal Palace, replacing Bill Turner at centre half. He spent the first half of the following season in the reserves until mid-February when he was called into the team at left half (with George Harkus moving forward), and retained his place for the rest of the season. For the 1925‚Äì26 season he played approximately half of the league games and scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Fulham on 10 April 1925. He missed most of the following season, unable to break into the established half-back line of Bert Shelley, George Harkus and Stan Woodhouse. From 1927‚Äì28 onwards he was more regularly selected by manager Arthur Chadwick, often filling in at full back in place of Michael Keeping or Ted Hough. According to Holley & Chalk, he was \\"ideally built for a centre- back role (his) versatility was put to good use and in emergencies he would even play in goal\\". Midway through the 1929‚Äì30 season he was moved to right- back taking over from Hough for the rest of the season, retaining his place at right back for the following season, in which he missed only three matches. Following the departure of manager Chadwick in April 1931, his replacement George Kay signed Frank Campbell from Scotland who was generally preferred to Bradford, who played in only about half the matches in 1931‚Äì32. By the following season, with Johnny McIlwaine taking a year out to play in the Welsh League, Bradford was team captain, missing only four matches as Saints again finished in Second Division mid-table obscurity. He continued to appear regularly over the next few seasons, and could be selected for any of the two full back and three centre back positions. After 14 seasons at The Dell, Bradford eventually retired at the end of the 1935‚Äì36 season. During this period he played under four managers and made a total of 319 appearances (with 7 goals); all his league matches were in the Second Division in a period during which the Saints struggled financially and were generally forced to sell their better players to survive. Bradford's loyalty and longevity earned him two benefit matches. After leaving the Saints, he became the licensee at the Plume of Feathers public house in St Mary's Street. He also played one season with Cowes Sports helping them to win the Hampshire Senior Cup. He died in Southampton on 13 April 1944 aged only 41 years.

Biography Born in Wolfwil, Switzerland, Kissling went through apprenticeship as a plasterer before moving to Rome for 13 years, studying under the sculptor Ferdinand Schl√∂th. At the 1883 National Exhibition in Zurich, Kissling showed a portrait bust of the Swiss politician Alfred Escher.

Some historical sources says his name is Liu Zhijia (Chinese:ÂäâÂü∑Âòâ), although this name is likely chosen after Liu Bang became Emperor. He likely came from a humble, rural background. After Taigong's son Liu Bang became emperor, Liu Bang continued to visit his father once a week. However, upon hearing from an advisor that it was no longer appropriate for Taigong to \\"receive\\" his son, as Taigong was technically one of his subjects, Taigong began to greet his son in deprecatory fashion, honoring the latter's status as emperor. Upon learning the reason behind his father's actions, Liu Bang honored Taigong with the title Taishang Huang after Liu Bang declared himself emperor. The title nominally elevated Liu's status in court protocol as to remain consistent with Confucian norms of filial piety. Taigong died at a palace in the city of Yueyang in 197 BC.

He organized a volunteer company for the Confederate States Army after the outbreak of the Civil War and became its captain. He rose to the grade of brigadier general in the Confederate army. Granbury was one of the six Confederate generals killed at the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864. Early life Hiram Bronson Granbury was born in Copiah County, Mississippi, March 1, 1831.Warner, Ezra J., Generals in Gray, p. 114. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. . He was the son of a Baptist minister. He was born Hiram Granberry, but upon reaching adulthood, by 1852 Granberry had changed the spelling of his name to Granbury. After being educated at Oakland College near Lorman, Mississippi, he moved to Waco, Texas, in the early 1850s. Granbury studied law at Baylor University in Waco, was admitted to the bar and served as chief justice of McLennan County, Texas (a largely administrative position as head of the county court), from 1856 to 1858.Faust, Patricia L., ed., Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War, p. 317.

New York: Facts On File, 1988. . In October 1861, he was elected major of the 7th Texas Infantry Regiment. He was captured along with his regiment at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 16, 1862. Granbury was imprisoned at Fort Warren in Boston Harbor but was permitted to visit Baltimore on parole in order to attend to his wife, who was to have an operation. He was freed in an exchange of prisoners on August 27, 1862 for two lieutenants. Almost immediately, on August 29, 1862, Granbury was promoted to colonel of the 7th Texas Infantry Regiment. He was temporarily without a command until January 1863 because the 7th Texas Infantry Regiment was not exchanged until November 1862 and was consolidated with two other regiments until January 1863. =Vicksburg campaign, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Atlanta campaign= Granbury and his regiment served in north Mississippi with General Joseph E. Johnston‚Äôs Army of Tennessee during the Vicksburg Campaign. Colonel Granbury led the regiment in the battles of Raymond and Jackson. Granbury fought and was wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga. He then participated in the Siege of Chattanooga and the Battle of Missionary Ridge. When Brigadier General James Argyle Smith was wounded at Chattanooga, Granbury led the brigade in the retreat from Chattanooga. Division commander, Major General Patrick R. Cleburne, commended Colonel Granbury for his handling of the brigade. =Battle of Franklin, death= Brigadier General James A Smith returned to the brigade command for the Atlanta Campaign. At about the same time, on February 29, 1864, Colonel Granbury was promoted to brigadier general. He then led the Texas brigade. This brigade was composed of eight (8) understrength Texas regiments, including the 7th Texas Infantry, through the Atlanta Campaign.The other Texas regiments were the 6th, 10th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 24th and 25th Texas Infantry Regiments. He fought with particular distinction at the Battle of Pickett's Mill in the Atlanta Campaign. General John B. Hood had taken over command of the Army of Tennessee during the Atlanta Campaign. After the fall of Atlanta, Hood moved his army into Tennessee in an effort to retake Nashville for the Confederacy. At the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864, Hood ordered 18 brigades to make numerous hopeless frontal assaults against fortified positions occupied by the Union Army forces under Major General John M. Schofield. Granbury's brigade charged the center of the Federal breastworks and he was killed, along with Major General Patrick R. Cleburne, just outside the Union works.Warner, 1959, p. 115 In total, six Confederate generals died in or as a result of the battle. Brigadier General James A. Smith took command of Cleburne's division at the subsequent Battle of Nashville.Warner, 1959, p. 282. Reburial at Granbury, Texas Twenty-nine (29) years after the battle of Franklin, Hiram Granbury's body was moved to Granbury, Texas, a town named after him. At the time of Granbury's death, he was serving as the elected Senior Warden of Waco Masonic Lodge #92, the oldest organization still in existence in McLennan County. This meant that had he survived the War, he was in line to become the lead officer of the lodge the very next year. The city of Granbury celebrates an annual General Granbury's Birthday Bash.

The studios and AM transmitter are located on U.S. Route 113 northwest of Georgetown. The station is repeated by two FM translators, covering Georgetown and Laurel. History=Early years= On December 13, 1950, Rollins Broadcasting received a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a new daytime-only radio station on 900 kHz in Georgetown. The station signed on June 23, 1951, (The Yearbook says 1961, not 1951, in error.) the first in Sussex County and an independent outlet. Soon after the station launched, in October 1952, John W. Rollins, co-owner of Rollins Broadcasting with his brother O. Wayne and Lieutenant Governor of Delaware from 1953 to 1957, announced plans to file for a television station on channel 40, which would have been the first on the Lower Peninsula. The station was never opened, but Rollins continued to expand its Delaware media holdings with the 1954 acquisition of WAMS (1380 AM) in Wilmington. However, Rollins wanted to reach a larger market. After its attempt to increase power from 1,000 to 5,000 watts was dismissed in 1954, Rollins filed to move WJWL from Georgetown to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, if it could get a new frequency in Georgetown, 1250 kHz, which would use the station's present equipment. In July 1955, the application was changed to be that of a new station for Philadelphia, though another applicant was awarded the frequency in 1957. =Scott ownership= Rollins sold WJWL to Herbert Scott and his Scott Broadcasting in 1960 for $400,000. Herbert Scott continued to own and manage WJWL, airing a middle-of- the-road music format, and its FM counterpart WSEA (93.5 FM), which he had put on air in July 1969; he had become the largest individual owner of radio stations in the United States by the time he died in 1984 of a heart attack. Ed Marzoa, who had been the founding station manager in 1951 and had hosted a talk show, Hot Line, since 1967, was forced out in 1979. The station had adopted a country music format by 1983. The call letters were changed from WJWL to WSEA on September 3, 1987‚Äîby which time the station aired an adult standards format‚Äîand again to WSSR on January 18, 1991. Adult standards gave way to news/talk in 1997. The change, however, lasted less than a year, and the station reverted to adult standards in early 1998, at the same time reclaiming its heritage WJWL call letters. =Spanish and two sales= WJWL would change from standards to Spanish in 2010, becoming Spanish contemporary hit radio station \\"M√°xima\\", simulcast on WXSH (106.1 FM). The M√°xima programming was produced by Hola Media Network, Inc., under a local marketing agreement with Great Scott Broadcasting. The death of Mitch Scott in 2013, after a battle with leukemia, was the catalyst for the end of Great Scott's operations on Delmarva. Sale preparations began in September 2013. The stations were split up between Adams Radio Group and The Voice Radio Network the next year, with The Voice slated to buy WJWL. After the deal, an apparent major problem soon emerged that threatened the entire transaction, as Hola Media Network, the LMA operator of WJWL, claimed it had first right of refusal to buy the station. Great Scott claimed it did not know about any such right, given that the late Mitch Scott had negotiated the programming agreement. The protest, also dismissed by the FCC, was highly unusual, as Edwin \\"Kevin\\" Andrade was the head of Hola and The Voice Radio Network. After a settlement was reached in the deal in March 2015, Adams Radio Group CEO Ron Stone called the purchase of the Scott Delmarva cluster \\"the longest deal in my lifetime\\". The Voice continued to operate WJWL as M√°xima‚Äînow being simulcast with WKDB (95.3 FM)‚Äîand in 2015, Adams sold the station and its accompanying FM translator to The Voice for $60,000.

He was the son of Mubariz al-Din Abu'l-Fath ibn Mas'ud. Struggle to gain control of Sistan Nasir al-Din's uncle Shams al-Din 'Ali ibn Mas'ud had been the first of the Mihrabanid maliks. When Shams al-Din 'Ali was murdered in 1255, the Kartid malik Shams ud-Din occupied Shahr-i Sistan. Shams ud-Din went before Hulagu Khan and claimed that his seizure of Sistan was legitimate, as he had a grant (yarligh) that had been given to him by the Great Khan M√∂ngke for the province. Nasir al-Din, meanwhile, asserted his own claim to the throne, attempting to gain Hulagu's support and sending his great-uncle Shuja' al-Din Nasr ibn Khalaf to take control of Sistan after the Kartid malik had departed. Despite these diplomatic attempts, Nasir al-Din did not receive a yarligh for six years and was further hampered by a second invasion by the Kartids. It was only in the spring of 1261 that he received official sanction from Hulagu to rule Sistan. Upon Nasr al-Din's return to Shahr-i Sistan, Kartid representatives were expelled and a purge of individuals deemed to be supportive of the Kartids or who had collaborated with the murderers of Shams al-Din 'Ali was initiated. Despite this, when Shams ud-Din invaded again and attacked Shahr-i Sistan in October 1263, several groups hostile to Nasr al-Din supported the Kartid. Rule as Malik Shams al-Din 'Ali had courted Jochids during his reign, a policy that Nasir al-Din continued. During the Berke‚ÄìHulagu war an army led by the Jochid noyan Junjudar arrived in Sistan near the end of 1264. A joint Ilkhanid-Kartid force battled with and defeated the Jochids; Junjudar fled to Shahr-i Sistan and received refuge from Nasir al-Din. In retaliation the Ilkhanids and Kartids ravaged parts of Sistan and killed many civilians, then laid siege to Shahr-i Sistan. After forty days the siege had not ended, so the two sides made peace with each other and the invaders left Sistan in early 1265. From 1267 until 1269 Nasir al-Din was active in northern Sistan establishing his authority over the towns there. The towns, especially Uq, resented being ruled from Shahr-i Sistan. Several sieges were necessary but eventually Nasir al-Din was able to firmly regain control of the region. During this time he was also active in fighting the raids of Qaraunas (also known as Neguderis)C. Edmund Bosworth Sistan and Its Local Histories, p.39 bands who aligned with the Chagatayids and had to put down a rebellion staged by his chamberlain. Relations with the Ilkhanids had not significantly improved since the siege of Shahr-i Sistan, and in 1276 or 1277 Abaqa Khan sent an army to invade Sistan. The Ilkhanids caused havoc in the countryside but an advance on the capital was defeated by the Mihrabanid army. The breach with the Ilkhanate was somewhat mended after Ahmed Tekuder's ascension in 1282; the ilkhan sent Nasir al-Din a yarligh and other insignia as a confirmation of his rule. Having secured control of Sistan and ensured its defense against external forces, Nasir al-Din was free to pursue a relatively independent foreign policy. Sistan became a haven for political refugees, such as several Qutlugh-Khanids and the atabeg of Yazd. At the same time, the Mihrabanids used military force to expand their borders. After repelling a marauding Mongol band, Qaraunas, from Sistan, Nasir al-Din's son Shams al-Din 'Ali advanced on Quhistan, a Kartid appanage, and seized control of it. Shams al-Din soon ran into problems maintaining his hold over Quhistan, but was helped by military assistance from his father. Domestic improvements were also made, including the construction of irrigation canals and channels. In 1318 Nasir al-Din found himself threatened by the Chagatayid commander Yasa'ur, who had been granted the region around Badghis by √ñljait√º Khan. Yasa'ur invaded Sistan after having refused Nasir al-Din's offers of tribute, but became worried when a Neguderi band threatened his rear. He therefore retreated from Sistan, instead choosing to harass the Kartids. Conflict with Rukn al-Din Mahmud The late period of Nasir al-Din's reign was consumed with fighting between the malik and his eldest son, Rukn al-Din Mahmud. After relations between the two fell apart, Rukn al-Din fled to Quhistan. Eventually he established a power base on the fringes of Kerman and began conducting raids into Sistan. After an army sent to subdue him was defeated, Nasir al-Din decided to come to terms and gave Rukn al-Din the citadel of Shahr-i Sistan and several fortresses. Nasir al-Din quickly decided not to honor this peace agreement and attacked Rukn al-Din's forces. Rukn al-Din was compelled to retreat from Sistan, but only temporarily. When he returned he initiated a siege of Shahr-i Sistan. Eight months of fighting in the capital failed to establish a clear winner and caused a significant amount of damage to the city, so the religious leaders of Sistan stepped in and decided on a division of power. Rukn al-Din was allotted all of Sistan west of the Helmand River, with Nasir al-Din retaining the eastern portion of the province. Despite all this, Nasir al-Din again opened hostilities with Rukn al-Din soon after, prompting the latter to raid Uq and Zirih. In around 1318, Nasir al-Din died.There is some confusion over when Nasir-al Din actually died. Coins featuring the name of his successor Nusrat al-Din start appearing shortly after this, but at the same time there are coins featuring Nasir al-Din's ism, instead of his laqab. Either way, Nasir al-Din's rule must have effectively come to an end by this point. Bosworth, p. 441. Rukn al-Din was incapable of marching to Shahr-i Sistan due to an injury, enabling his brother Nusrat al-Din Muhammad to take control of the capital. NotesReferences *Bosworth, C.E.

This after the Cape Town Administrator and its Executive Committee decided to make funds available for the construction of residences for the school in 1950. The tradition of boarding continues to this day and has become an integral part of life at Jan van Riebeeck High, with a large number of pupils coming from afar. = Huis Jordaan = In 1952, the school committee and staff decided that the girls hostel would be called Huis Jordaan, a lasting reminder of the late Mr. J.J. Jordaan, the first head of Jan van Riebeeck High School (1926 ‚Äì 1936). On 9 December 1952, the cornerstone of Huis Jordaan was laid by Dr. W. de Vos Malan, Superintendent General of Education, and on 12 January 1953, Huis Jordaan was captured. The residence has a historically stringent staff selection criteria and employ only energetic and enthusiastic personnel. These staff are predominantly educators attached to the school so that good education practices are assured. Huis Jordaan is a busy and vibrant house, which prides itself in being more than just a residence ‚Äì one where lifelong friendships, dreams and experiences are built. The girls (Sop) and boys (Rog) houses are balanced residences that perform excellently in academic, cultural, leadership, social and sports. Time management at Huis Jordaan has historically been a focus and even though academic standards are given high priority, there remains ample time for games, braais on the ‚Äústoep‚Äù, festive excursions and exciting opportunities that gives the house its liveliness. Students departing the hostels at the end of their final year of study are said to have developed a noticeable sense of independence and confidence which accompanies a real sense of self-worth. The Huis Jordaan facility caters for boys and girls from Grade 8 to 12, and accommodates termly and weekly boarders, with students returning home for the school holidays. Being a resident on campus means boarders have easy access to the many wonderful school facilities. The facility is located next to the historic Welgemeend on the school premises in Kloof Street. Huis Jordaan reflects a homely atmosphere where strong traditions and a good spirit fill the guest rooms. Currently Huis Jordaan is jointly managed by Huibrecht Steyn, the Ladies Superintendent (House Mother), and Jakkie Steyn, the Gents Superintendent (House Father). In 2016 management started with a building and modernisation process. All boarders receive WiFI connectivity. From 2018 the Huis Jordaan facility accommodates both residences (girls and boys) on the school grounds.

It was designed for particle detectors using CAMAC and VMEbus hardware.  Description  MIDAS (Maximum Integration Data Acquisition System) has been developed as a general purpose data acquisition system for small and medium scale experiments originally by Stefan Ritt in 1993, followed by Pierre-Andr√© Amaudruz in 1996. It is written in C and published under the GPL. The experiment complexity ranges from test systems, where a single PC is connected to CAMAC via a PC-CAMAC interface, to experiments with several front-end computers and analysis nodes. The system currently runs under Linux, MS Windows, various versions of UNIX, VMS, VxWorks and MS-DOS and can be ported easily to virtually any operating system which supports TCP/IP sockets. A speed optimized RPC layer is used for data exchange, with which sustained data rates of 980kB/s (10BaseT), 8.7 MB/s (100BaseT) and up to 98MB/s (1000BaseT). An integrated slow control system contains a fast online database and a history system. Drivers exist for CAMAC, VME, Fastbus, High Voltage Crates, GBIB and several PC plug-in DAQ boards. A framework is supplied which can be extended by user code for front-end readout on one side and data analysis on the other side. The online data can be presented by PAW as histograms and N-tuples as well as by ROOT. A dedicated HTTP server gives fast Web access for experiment control and to access the slow control system including a graphical representation of variable trends (history display).  Usage of MIDAS  MIDAS is used in many experiments in nuclear and particle physics.

The song features American musician Lee Hazlewood in his last recording and collaboration. The vocal parts consist of Lee telling a story accompanied by a reworked version of the song \\"Hilli\\" whose original version is available on Kurr. The story has a strong environmental message. It starts by setting the scene of the simple life of the people from the top of the world (a \\"magical island\\") whose spirit is found by the snow laden world they live in. It conjures up an idyllic scene of children catching snowflakes - \\"they fall like candy....they open their mouths and gulp down the flakes, 'cos nothing on earth tastes so sweet.\\" Then, the story turns darker as on the horizon the people see fire \\"and the water did rise and the snow started melting away.\\" The fire represents man's environmental damage. The snow started to melt and spread throughout the world as light, running upstream and bursting through fountains and springs. At first the people around the world were not shocked by what they saw, not understanding what had caused it....\\"even their teachers did not know what the bright light was for.\\" All were initially touched by this light, but as they \\"looked all around\\" and up at the sky, they \\"realised the damage they had done.\\" It ends with penance: \\"as they started to cry, their tears filled the sky as the dark clouds formed above. And then the heavens opened and the rains came to show them, that the world needs a little more love.\\" Before the single was released it was rumored that a cover version of Lee's song \\"Leather and Lace\\" would be the single's second track, but this turned out to be just a rumor.

Examples of a web presence for a person could be a personal website, a blog, a profile page, a wiki page, or a social media point of presence (e.g. a LinkedIn profile, a Facebook account, or a Twitter account). Examples of a web presence for a business or some other entity could be a corporate website, a microsite, a page on a review site, a wiki page, or a social media point of presence (e.g., a LinkedIn company page and/or group, a Facebook business/brand/product page, or a Twitter account). Every web presence is associated with a unique web address to distinguish one point of presence from another. Owned vs. Unowned Web presence can either be owned or unowned. Owned media exists when a single person or group can control the content that is published on its web presence (e.g. a corporate website or a personal Twitter account). However, when a single person or group cannot solely control the content, the creator is different from the owner. This is considered unowned media (see earned media). A Wikipedia or Yelp page about a person, company, or product would be an example of a known (or \\"earned\\") web presence. Occasionally, a first form of media known as \\"paid media\\" is often included in the discussion of media types: \\"earned vs. owned vs. paid\\". Paid media is commonly found in the form of advertisements, but it is not considered a form of web presence. Management Web presence management is the process of establishing and maintaining a digital footprint on the web. The three factors that are considered include the following: where a person or business has web presence; how each web presence represents its enterprise; and what is published at a point of presence. Web presence management is the discipline of determining and governing: * the distribution of policy documents * which platforms are most appropriate (e.g. internal vs. external blog, YouTube vs. Vimeo) * the single inventory of personal or corporate web presence (e.g. partners or advocates) * where on the web a business and any relatable assets are represented * where on the web a business and any relatable assets are impersonated or pirated * web properties with the particular entities they represent * who has control over which web properties * new web properties which are not in the personal or corporate inventory (e.g. someone creates a new presence) * authorized and unauthorized changes to the creation (e.g. branding) of a web presence * a workflow for creating a web property that follows its corporate standards =Management system= The purpose of a web presence management system is to manage the web presence of a person or business. This includes the collection of domain names, websites, social media, and other web pages where he, she, or it is being represented. The tool generally offers the following key functions: new presence discovery, inventory management, change detection, access control, stakeholder coordination, and compliance workflow. A web presence management system is meant to have a broader reach so that it emphasizes where a presence has been established, will be established, must be maintained, or must be remediated. An example of a web presence management system is the Brandle Presence Manager. In order to publish content to the various points of web presence, multiple content management systems and sometimes even social media management systems are often used. The primary focus of most content and social media management systems is limited to their specific web platforms. =Domain names= Another aspect of web presence management is managing the collection of domain names registered to the person or business. Any entity may register multiple domain names for the same property. As a result, they can link alternative spellings, different top-level domains, aliases, brands, or products to the same website. Similarly, negative or derogatory domain names may also be registered. This is done to prevent certain domain names from being used against the person or business. It is common for a larger business to have domain names registered by multiple employees at multiple domain name registrars, possibly a result of organizational or geographical requirements. Consequently, a web presence management system can be used to monitor all domain names registered by the business, regardless of the registrars used. Discovery Web presence discovery is the process of monitoring the web for a new point of presence about a person or business. Web presence discovery is often included in a web presence management system. Whether a new domain is registered, a new website is published, or a new social media account is established, it occurs outside of the person's or business‚Äô control. As a result, its purpose is to assess a new point of presence and appropriately handle any violations. It is important to note that web presence discovery differs from content listening. The former involves looking for new properties on the web, whereas the latter refers to analyzing content that already exists to hear how a person or business is seen often in near real time. Examples of content listening systems include Sysomos and Radian6, which is now a subsidiary of Salesforce.com. =Brand protection= A person or business may choose to watch for a new web presence that might appear to misrepresent or mislead an audience, such as counterfeiters, spoofers, or malicious hackers. One of the early software in the online brand protection marketplace was MarkMonitor, now part of Thomson Reuters. This software helped detect rogue domain names and websites. However, the modern day growth of social media has seen a rise in the number of fraudulent brand impersonations. It has become much easier for a new web presence to be created on those platforms, which results in a greater frequency of them today. As a preventive measure, online brand protection providers are now adding social media to their domain and website discovery options. =Security= The widespread growth of social media has also made it easier for unauthorized individuals to impersonate an employee. Consequently, social media has now become a recognized threat vector in that it can be used to socially engineer an attack on a business. To counter this, companies are able to use web presence monitoring tools to detect new points of presence on the web and thereby defend against socially engineered attacks. =Distributed inventory management= A web presence monitoring system can be used by a business to associate a new web property with its corporate inventory. It is designed to address autonomous, distributed behaviors. This usually applies to larger businesses whose geographically diverse employees are more prone to creating new points of presence on the web. For example, a retail chain may allow each local store to create and manage their web presence to market to and communicate with their local customer base. Similarly, a global business may have teams in each country or region who create and manage a web presence to adapt to local languages or cultures. Monitoring Web presence monitoring is the process of monitoring a known inventory of web presence to detect any changes that are made. Web presence monitoring is often included in a web presence management system and can serve multiple purposes for both larger corporations and certain individuals, such as celebrities. It is important to note that presence monitoring differs from content listening. The former involves monitoring the properties (e.g. branding) of a web property in an established inventory, whereas the latter refers to analyzing content that already exists to hear how a person or business is seen often in near real time. Additionally, presence monitoring focuses on owned media and content listening on earned media. =Corporate, brand, and regulatory compliance= Many companies ensure that certain standards are met for a property on the web that represents their business. For companies in regulated industries, such as finance and healthcare, the company may be required by law to ensure that all publicized content, regardless of platform or technology, follow specific requirements. The widespread growth of social media has seen a rise in the number of fraudulent corporate impersonations. It has become much easier for a new web presence to be created on these platforms, and so these are much more prevalent than they used to be. As a preventive measure, a web presence monitoring system alerts the company when a known property is changed, allowing for the property to be reviewed and amended so that it follows the proper standards. . A web presence monitoring system helps alert the company when a known property is changed, so it can be reviewed and brought back, if necessary, into compliance with the appropriate standards. Audit A web presence audit is performed by an enterprise to determine that all points of presence on the web meet the objectives as well as governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) needs. To ensure neutrality, these audits are often conducted as part of an information technology audit by a professional services agency or an internal audit team. However, a less formal web presence audit is often performed by internal members as a routine to meet GRC objectives. A web presence audit usually includes web presence discovery and a review of all web-based content in the business‚Äô inventory of web presence. Even though web presence monitoring is not performed in a web presence audit, a review of the nature and scope of the company's web presence monitoring policies, procedures, and tools is considered. =Social media audit= Due to the emerging challenges introduced by the dynamic nature of social media, a business may choose to perform specific social media audits in greater frequency. A social media audit is similar to a web presence audit, but may also include the purposes of maintaining an accurate inventory of all business social media points of presence. Alternatively, the business may choose to employ automated web presence discovery and compliance systems to keep the corporate social media inventory up-to-date and compliant with GRC needs. Web presence vs. web reputation management Reputation management systems are often associated with web presence management. Web presence management is knowing where an individual or business is represented, whereas reputation management is knowing what people are saying about an individual or business. Web presence management handles owned media, while reputation management systems with earned media. Both systems offer some similar degree of remediation. For web presence management systems, remediation would include finding counterfeit properties that infringe on a brand or trademark. For reputation management systems, remediation would include identifying and eliminating misleading reviews and/or encouraging the contribution of authentic comments. Even though a web presence monitoring tool can help identify unowned web properties where people are talking about a person, product, or brand, it is only part of the solution. A reputation management system often includes a content listening system to monitor the stream of messages about a particular subject which may be coming from any point of presence on the web (e.g. a comment about a product by a customer on her personal Twitter account).

Initially part of Nazi German Wehrmacht, Smyslovsky's forces were elevated to the 1st Russian National Army on 10 March 1945. On 4 April 1945 it received a status of the independent allied army. Liechtenstein was the only state which denied Soviet demands for the extradition of Russians who fought in the side of the Axis powers. Before 1945, the Army was known as Sonderdivision R, an organisation composed of White emigrants, who trained prisoners of war and defectors from the Red Army to obtain information about the partisan movement, like the names of the main leaders and their locations.  Retreat By April 1945, Smyslovsky had moved his remaining fighters to Feldkirch where he met Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich, the Romanov claimant to the Russian Imperial Crown. The whittled-down army of 462 men, 30 women, and 2 children then moved into neutral LiechtensteinARGENTINA: Last of the Wehrmacht ‚Äì Monday, Apr. 13, 1953 on 2 May 1945, the Grand Duke, however, decided to stay in the US occupied zone in Austria because neither Liechtenstein nor Switzerland would issue him a visa. The Russians were cared for by the Liechtenstein Red Cross. On 16 August 1945, a Soviet delegation came to Liechtenstein in an attempt to repatriate the Russians. Homesick and subject to cajoling and menacing, about 200 of the group agreed to return. They departed in a train to Vienna and nothing was ever heard of them again. The remainder stayed in Liechtenstein for another year, resisting with support of Liechtenstein further pressure by the Soviet government to participate in the repatriation program. Eventually the government of Argentina offered asylum, and about a hundred people left. According to Alexander Frick, Prime Minister of Liechtenstein (1945-1962), the Russians were at no point in danger of being extradited, and the local population fully supported the government in providing asylum to the Russians. The small population of the country (12,141 in 1945) supported the √©migr√©s (4% of the population) at a rate of CHF 30,000 per month for two years and paid their costs to move to Argentina; they did not know that these costs were later to be reimbursed by Germany. While the Western Allies and other countries in Europe complied with Soviet requests to repatriate Soviet citizens regardless of their individual wishes, Liechtenstein was the only country that stood up to these demands and informed the Soviet government that only those Russians who wanted to go home would be permitted to go. Those soldiers of the 1st Russian National Army who chose to return to the USSR were summarily executed by the Soviet military authorities after their arrival in the Soviet Union.

The title \\"Navaratna\\", which means Nine Gems, was given to him by the seer of Uttaradi Mutt for the scholarly services rendered to the orthodox Deshastha Madhwa Brahmin Society by the nine scholar-brothers in that family.  Career  Born in 1877, Rao descended from Deshastha Madhwa Brahmins. He attended Central College of Bangalore along with C. Rajagopalachari, who would become a lifelong friend, and was influenced by Scottish teacher John Guthrie Tait. He received his law degree in Madras and subsequently practiced in Salem, Tamil Nadu. He retired in 1951 and his memoirs were published by Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, who was a close friend. Rama Rao passed the Mysore Civil Services Examination to join the State Administration in the Princely Mysore where he served in various positions starting his career as \\"Amildar\\" and retiring as the Director of Industries and Commerce of the State. His service was to the Princely State of Mysore, ruled then by HH Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Maharaja of Mysore. He attended the first Round Table Conference in London in 1930 as Advisor to the then Diwan, Sir Mirza Ismail. As a planner, he was responsible for establishing Silk Industry in Mysore and subsequently the Central Silk Board of India on which he served as Vice-Chairman. In recognition of his public service, he was conferred the title \\"RAJASEVAPRASAKTA\\" by the then Maharaja of Mysore, Sri Jayachamaraja Wodeyar. He was friends with Bharata Ratna, V. T. Krishnamachari, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, D. V. Gundappa and M. S. Subbulakshmi. As a member of Legislative Assembly representing the Government while in service and as an elected member of Legislative council by the State Chamber of Commerce and Industries, he was responsible for many decisions taken by the Government. Bharata Ratna C. Rajagopalachari used to stay in the house of Mr.Rama Rao at Basavanagudi, when he visited Bangalore.  Literary life  Though studied in Shakespeare and Western literature, he was also versed in Kannada, Sanskrit and French. Rajaji‚Äôs Ramayana and Mahabharata, two early works of Indian literature in the English language, were revised by Rama Rao, as C. Rajagopalachari himself acknowledges in the preface. All these are chronicled in his memoir Kelavu Nenapugalu and Masti‚Äôs book Navaratna Rama Rao. Rama Rao‚Äôs literary work included his translation of Masti‚Äôs Kannada novel Chenna Basava Nayaka to English, translation of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli‚Äôs book The Prince to Kannada, his Sanna Kathegalu and his chronicled life- sketches of the dynasty of Mysore Rulers besides several articles he wrote to the then Madras Times journal on Shakespeare‚Äôs works and contemporary national politics when he was studying law at Madras.

It is specified in CCITT Recommendations Q.251-Q.300.ITU-T Recommendation Q.251-Q.300 - Specifications of Signalling System No. 6 The system had limited applications since at that time the predecessor systems Signaling System No. 5 (C5) and C4 were widely in use, but there was a need to experience common channel working on a fast digital basis. Traffic switching in the ISCs was then typically handled by crossbar switches or electronically controlled cross-points such as reed relays. The transmission media were likely satellite links or long terrestrial submarine cable channels. In some cases these were advantaged or multiplied with time- assignment speech interpolation (TASI) or digital circuit multiplication equipment (DCME). These transmission methods were not suited to line or inter- register signalling. Taking the signalling function away from the traffic channel could cut costs, and would later lead to Common Channel Signalling. There would be no need for filtering signalling away from speech, and the duty cycle of the costly trunk for each revenue earning call would be better. Signalling time in call set up and clear down would be significantly shorter than with C4 and C5. With telephone signalling not transmitted over the line, the opportunities for fraud were reduced. The CCITT 6 signalling channel was typically a 2.4 kbit/s data link. Technology at the time was an M1040 or M1020 analogue Four-wire circuit presented private circuit link. Modems were slowly beginning to exceed these data rates over 4w circuits; these data links had the advantage that there was no national tail from the ISC out to a normal end point in the country. It was often the National Section that detracted the most from the quality and reliability of such links. The data circuit known with a DP designation, would have been terrestrial with no TASI or DCME, and the C6 signalling on the data link could perform for 48 or 96 traffic channels. It could function for up to 2,048 in the maximum. The question is whether two operators would have that many traffic channels between them, dependent on just one bearer for signalling and subject to occasional failure. It was of course practice to have standby route over a diverse path in case of outage on the original DP data circuit link. Finally it was considered possible that a mesh of such data channels could be set up between major centres, leading to a system where the link between country A and country B could perform the signalling functions for links to country A from country D for example. CCITT No 6 was a method developed & implemented by administrations in a limited number of countries for use in correspondent International Switching of analogue telephone calls. The next development was correspondent and non-correspondent switching of telephone calls by new operators in the countries where more sophisticated methods were required.

Executed by Elizabeth I of England at age 11 in 1544. In embroidery, plainweave is a technical category of woven base fabrics that are suitable for working certain varieties of embroidery. Plainweave fabrics have a tight weave and individual threads are not readily visible. Surface embroidery may be performed on plainweave, such as crewel work, goldwork, stumpwork, cutwork, and candlewicking. Embroideries that can be performed on plainweave do not require the crafter to perform stitches at a precise thread count. Most woven fabrics that were not specifically manufactured for the purpose of embroidery qualify as plainweave. Traditionally, linen plainweave is the preferred fabric for crewel embroidery. Other plainweaves suitable for crewel include denim, sailcloth, ticking, and organdy when worked in wool. Plainweave uses Historic eighteenth century crewel embroidery preferentially used a linen and cotton twill plainweave because it wore well. The fabric's diagonal rib was regarded as an esthetically pleasing contrast to the embroidery, although sometimes it was brushed before working to create a smoother nap. This material, known as fustian originated in Fust√¢t in ancient times and was probably the forerunner of velvet. Almost any plainweave fabric can be made suitable for goldwork and other metal embroidery. Fine linen is among the easiest to work with. Silk has been the preferred fabric historically in clerical and royal garments to achieve a shiny and sumptuous effect. Lightweight or stretchy plainweaves may require stabilization to prevent puckering. Traditionally a backing of linen or muslin would be used as a stabilizing element. Dressmaker's interlining and water-soluble paper are contemporary alternatives. Whitework may be worked on either plainweave or counted thread fabric. When worked on plainweave it is known as fine white. Organdy, sheer Dacron, lawn, batiste, muslin, net, and sheer muslin and wool are suitable plainweaves for this type of embroidery. Stumpwork embroidery can be done on nearly any fabric including silk, satin, felt, linen, cotton, and wool.

Bowling was convicted and sentenced to death for the April 9, 1990, murders of Tina and Eddie Earley. Bowling shot the Earleys dead after ramming their car outside their small dry-cleaning business in the city of Lexington, Kentucky. Bowling also shot the couple's two-year-old son, but the child survived. Thomas Bowling was arrested on April 11, in neighboring Tennessee. His car and a .357 calibre handgun were found hidden at his family's home in rural Kentucky. Bowling's attorneys pursued appeals and clemency on the grounds of potential innocence and mental retardation. Bowling died of cancer at the prisons nursing facility, aged 63. Appeal Bowling's lawyers claim the evidence against him is purely circumstantial, and there are other suspects for the murder. Bowling was assessed at the age of 12 - 13 to have an IQ of 74 which, given the margin of error, placed him within the range for mental retardation. In addition, he had a documented history of adaptive deficits, being described as a \\"follower\\" and easily manipulated. Throughout school, his parents had to lay his clothes out for him and ensure that he bathed and maintained personal hygiene. Bowling was a slow learner throughout school; He spent three years in the ninth grade, and failed health class three years in a row. Bowling's lawyers also argue that there was no physical evidence placing him at the scene of the crime; an eye-witness failed to identify him; ballistics experts admitted the weapon linked to him was one of millions that could have been used in the crime; and while the car used in the crime was his, there was no proof that he was driving it at the time. Further, the state did not establish a motive for Thomas Bowling to kill the Earley couple, whom he did not know and had never met. The lawyers assert that a local family murdered the Earleys. According to the petition and accompanying police reports, Eddie Earley told police about a local Lexington family's alleged drug activity, which resulted in an arrest. The family then had a motive for a shooting. Bowling's lawyers argue that the family apparently used Bowling's vehicle in the murder. On the day of the murders, Bowling was intoxicated and states that he cannot remember anything of that day. Apparently, however, he was told by members of the above family later that afternoon to take his car out of town. Supreme Court In 2004 Bowling sued the Kentucky State Department of Corrections along with fellow inmate Ralph Baze on the grounds that execution by lethal injection constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Baze's court case was Baze v. Rees. On April 16, 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, rejected the challenge to the use of lethal injections to execute prisoners.

Julleuchter (; \\"Yule lantern\\") or Turmleuchter (\\"tower lantern\\") are modern terms used to describe a type of earthenware candle- holder designed and manufactured in Nazi Germany. Swedish artefact The Julleuchter housed in the Nordic Museum has a height of 15cm and a base of 8.2cm squared. The candle-holder has an incised heart shape and below a six- spoked opening. This artefact was described in 1888 in the magazine of the Swedish literary club Runa (founded by Johan August Strindberg), which compared the six-spoked window in its base with the shape of the medieval h-rune; the 1888 article attributed a 16th-century date to the object (the earliest date of the introduction of candles to Scandinavian households). There are several surviving specimens of this type of candle-holder from Sweden. A comparable specimen was on display in the open-air museum of Skansen, based on a photograph kept in the Detmold state archive. Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism The Runa article came to the attention of Herman Wirth because of its supposed \\"Hagal rune\\" (the six-spoked window at its base) who mentioned it in his Ura Linda Chronik, whence it passed into Nazi-era Germanic mysticism. In a 1936 memorandum, Heinrich Himmler set forth a list of approved holidays, in part supposedly based on \\"pagan\\" traditions, including a \\"Julfest\\" intended to replace Christian rites. The Julleuchter and other symbols were also meant to serve as a consolation to women who, by having married into the SS, had to renounce the spiritual shelter and service of their church.Power Politics and Social Change in National Socialist Germany: A Process of Escalation into Mass Destruction, by John Michael Steiner, page 117. The SS soldier was instructed to set up a shrine that included a Julleuchter in the corner of one room of his household.\\"The house of the SS man ought to know because one of its corners is intended for the celebration of his family. In it is to summarize those things that remind people of his higher obligations. ...On the chest , in the corner and shall include heirlooms, are all year round and the Julleuchter the Julteller (pewter or earthenware) of individual family members who use them on all holidays of the year, but also on birthday, wedding and death . ... The Wall adorns the image of the Fuehrer and Reich SS, to pedigree and family photos, mementos of war and times of struggle. The large SS runes will not be absent. The Jul-and SS-corner is the yardstick the extent of the SS man and his wife at the Customs of the SS to participate.\\" SS Upper Section West: The design of the celebrations in the year and resume in the SS family, Wuppertal, nd, page 41, KW, Archive, 70/1/3/7, quoted in page 217 An article about the Julleuchter was published in the German magazine \\"Germanien\\" in December 1936. The author argued that this \\"millennia old\\" lantern was to be used as \\"a memento of the \\"Year of the Great Migrations of the people of the north\\"\\". Another article was published in the SS periodical SS-Leitheft Jahrgang 7 Folge 8a. In 1939 the Julleuchter was also mentioned in \\"Die Gestaltung der Feste im Jahres und Lebenslauf in der SS-Familie\\"(Celebrations of the SS Family) by Fritz Weitzel. The information about the 1936 issue of Germanien magazine about the Julleuchter is actually from the later magazine \\"Der Freiwillige.\\" The article in \\"Der Freiwillige\\" reports Germanien magazine being, ‚Ä¶\\"the official organ of the German ancestor inheritance registered association, Berlin.\\" The information given in that latter article is from Germanien magazine. A 1936 issue of Germanien magazine claimed that the \\"millennium old\\" lantern had been used as a memento of the \\"Year of the Great Migrations\\" of the people of the north and as the small light of humanity under the stars of the night sky. When used during the 2 Solstice periods of the year, this is a symbol of the victory of Light over the Darkness, and also as a token of Eternal Circulation. The Julleuchter stands for an inseparable community, its conscience and attitude, and that it was used as a symbol of never ending sunlight. Further, the magazine stated that when the Julleuchter was used during the holiday of Yule (what is now known as The 12 Days of Christmas), twelve candles are used. One is used each night symbolizing the twelve months, until the 31 of December when the \\"July Moon shines.\\" On that night a thirteenth candle is used for the new coming month of January. The candles always burn below but on the last night, the candle is again transferred upward ‚Äì this is the sun, which is spilled in order to return to the earth from the gloom of another peace.Germanien magazine, December 1936 Use in Himmler's SS The SS-Julleuchter was considered both an award and trophy of the German Schutzstaffel that was presented to members of the SS from approximately 1936 until 1944 as a service decoration. Manufactured by the Allach porcelain company, the SS Julleuchter was presented to any SS member who participated in a Julfest. Heinrich Himmler originally had the intention to make the Julleuchter a standard gift to all SS members and there were no criteria attached to its presentation. For reasons which are not entirely clear, by the start of World War II, the Julleuchter had begun to be viewed as an SS decoration, and was entered as such in SS service records once the Julleuchter had been presented.SS Service record collection, United States National Archives; College Park, Maryland However, as the SS-Julleuchter was considered \\"non-portable\\" (much like the Luftwaffe Honor Goblet), there was no outward display on an SS uniform indicating its presentation. Apparently even as the Red Army was advancing and the fall of Berlin was in the foreseeable future, The Julleuchter was used during the decoration French volunteers in the Waffen-SS. One surviving soldier said, \\"In the light of a candle burning on a Julleuchter, a Jule Candlestick, symbolizing the never dying sunlight, Fenet decorated a number of comrades with the Iron Cross. Although simple, the ceremony that evening seemed all the more extraordinary.\\"For Europe: the French volunteers of the Waffen-SS, by Robert Forbes, page 454. =SS Julfest= ::Not only the presents but the whole celebration should be full of surprises for all members of the family. The father lights the candle in the Jul-Leuchter, or 'Jul Earthenware Candlestick', from which the tree candles in turn get their light. [...] The Jul-Leuchter, presented by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Himmler to the SS Man, is the most important symbol used throughout the year to mark celebrations and commemorations. Its cut-out Heart represents hearth and home, and the Hagal Rune peace through victory. At midnight, when the candles on the Yuletide Tree are burnt down, the SS Man will put the Jul- Leuchter on the table. The Candlestick with its year-long candle has been lit at every family celebration the past year. Its candle has burned down, and it should receive a new one tonight. Just as our ancestors never let the sacred hearth cooking fire extinguish, so our Jul-Leuchter must always have a light. Thus it becomes a symbol of the never dying sunlight. Everyone becomes very thoughtful when the old candle finally burns down and the new one is put in its place.\\" (From \\"Celebrations of the SS Family\\" by Fritz Weitzel, 1939)Celebrations of the SS Family, by Fritz Weitzel 1939 =Manufacture in the Allach factory= In January 1936, the SS Porzellan Manufaktur Allach was created in Munich under the control of Heinrich Himmler. Well known artists were forced to participate. The output of the factory included over 240 porcelain and ceramic models. Due to a rapid expansion, the factory was not able to meet production targets, and so in October 1937 a part of production was shifted to the SS-operated Allach sub camp of the Dachau concentration camp. Originally the Allach factory manufactured only art ceramic, like plates, jugs and vases, but in the war years they also produced simple utensils like ointment containers and cafeteria table-ware. Special occasion gift items for SS supporters were also made and given away at dinner parties and other events. Starting from 1941 German civilians and about 50 prisoners of the Allach sub camp of the Dachau concentration camp were forced to produce art and porcelain. The Allach sub camp of Dachau remained the main location for porcelain manufacture even after the original factory in the town of Allach was modernized and reopened. The factory in the town of Allach was retrofitted for the production of ceramic products such as household pottery. The fall of the Third Reich brought an end to the Allach factory. The Allach factories were shut down in 1945 and never reopened. Allach porcelain made a variety of candle holders ranging from elaborate gilded baroque candelabras, to the most basic plain white porcelain single candle holder. More candleholders were made than for other Allach items, indicating popularity and interest among the German people. The varying styles and low cost (due to slave labor) of the candleholders produced at Allach allowed most Germans of every class to own them. The Allach factory deposited the Julleuchter design with the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin on 16 January 1936. The Allach Julleuchter was unique in that it was made as presentation piece for SS officers to celebrate the winter solstice. It was later given to all SS members on the same occasion, 21 December. Made of unglazed stoneware, the Julleuchter was decorated with early pagan Germanic symbols. =Significant recipients= * Hans Baur * Amon G√∂th * Heinrich Himmler * Ernst Kaltenbrunner * Josef Albert Meisinger * Oswald Pohl See also * Christmas in Nazi Germany * Religion in Nazi Germany * Religious aspects of Nazism References *Heinrich W.

Etymology  The name first appeared around 1780, but with a different meaning. It meant one involved in a poster's production and distribution, not its design: in particular, for producing handbills, setting up type and coordinating flyposting on walls, giving news on local and national events on a range of subjects.. Usually anonymous, these people are rarely considered artists, nor their products works of art.  Nineteenth century  At the end of the nineteenth century, poster art became a respectable art form, with the invention of large-scale colour lithography. (Chromolithography made its d√©but around 1870.) Artists such as Jules Ch√©ret and Alfons Mucha became famous within the art world, working almost exclusively on advertisements. Almost simultaneously, all Western countries had their own nascent movements: in Britain, the Arts and Crafts movement, and then the Glasgow School of Art (built by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), and in Chicago, where artist William H. Bradley had worked for an advertising agency.The Inland Printer, an American trade magazine for the press trade and the first of its kind, was founded in Chicago in 1882. In France, several famous painters such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec also worked on poster advertising for products or entertainments. Many illustrators also worked in advertising in addition to their work for illustrated newspapers.  Twentieth century  right Around 1900, posters in the art nouveau style started to appear, notably those by Leonetto Cappiello. The first dedicated street furniture for displaying posters appeared: in particular, the advertising column or \\"Morris column\\" (), together with large billboards, murals on buildings, and so on. Little by little, these new media were considered to be within the realm of the artist and the designer, leading to the notion of the graphic designer as a creator of images and new forms, with a greater understanding of the possibilities of the new graphic forms and the possibilities that the poster gave for expression. It was rare at this time for someone to be known as an affichiste or \\"poster designer\\" specifically. The names are still unknown of some prolific poster designers working in the 1910s in Anglo-Saxon countries. Art D√©co and more generally Modern Art, let many poster designers come to greater attention and to express their talents in this medium. Charles Gesmar, a prot√©g√© of Mistinguett since 1916, raised posters to high art, and his posters became enormously famous afterwards. In the 1920s, poster art became a cornerstone of graphic art, with works by artists such as Paul Iribe and Cassandre, who established Raymond Savignac. Around this time, photomontage also came to the fore, allowing poster artists to combine photography and typography. In the 1950s, techniques of xerography led to a new school of art which came to influence pop art. In the 1950s, the Polish artist Roman Cieslewicz brought an important school of affichiste to the fore, mostly on films, theatre works, and propaganda for the Polish Communist Party) with a nihilism bent, in the context of state censorship. Artists Raymond Hains and Jacques Villegl√©, meanwhile, took the name of affichistes for their photomontage work with collages of torn-up poster fragments. An exhibit of their works in 1957 termed their works (\\"Torn Posters\\"). In the last three decades of the twentieth century, techniques of offset printing and digital image processing became more widely used, but these new methods and media led to a great deal of innovation in poster design with new modes of expression.

The feature was shot using 19 rolls of 16mm film supposedly found sitting on a sidewalk on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Reports of paranormal activity The film's marketing played up the notion that the film was haunted. Media releases and interviews stated that the actors faces can be seen \\"morphing\\" into grotesque shapes in certain shots. There were reports of actors having elongated and webbed fingers, full bodied apparitions, seeing the faces of dead actors (such as Lon Chaney) manifest in shots, and shadows resembling demons or skeletons. Many of the cast and crew had confirmed many of these reports and stated they experienced odd events during production, with Jennifer Tilly in particular describing feeling \\"watched\\" and \\"touched\\" by unseen forces during filming. Release The film was released on 11 August 2013 in the United States. It was re-released on 16 January 2019 on YouTube after years of not finding home video distribution.

Early life Condor Laucke was the youngest son of a German immigrant, Friedrich Laucke, who had migrated to South Australia from Bremen in 1895. In 1899, his father established Laucke Mills at Greenock in South Australia's Barossa Valley. Laucke was educated at Immanuel College and the School of Mines in Adelaide, and after graduating, joined the family business, becoming Director and General Manager of what was now a large milling and stock feed enterprise in 1947. State politics Laucke was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly in the 1956 election, representing the Electoral district of Barossa as part of Sir Thomas Playford's Liberal and Country League government. He was re-elected in 1959 and 1962, and from 1962 to 1965 served as Government Whip and was regarded by colleagues as a potential future leader of the Liberal and Country League. However Laucke lost his seat to Labor candidate Molly Byrne in the 1965 election which swept the Liberal and Country League from office after 32 years in government--an election campaign in which Barossa, where northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate, was particularly targeted by Labor. Federal politics Laucke as President of the Senate Laucke then moved into Federal politics, being appointed as a Senator for South Australia to fill the vacancy left by the death of Senator Clive Hannaford, his term beginning on 2 November 1967. He represented South Australia until 1981, being re-elected in 1967, 1974 and 1975, and was President of the Australian Senate from 17 February 1976 until 30 June 1981. Other activities In 1974, Laucke was one of the founding members of the Barons of Barossa, an organisation formed to promote the Barossa Valley and its winemaking and grape growing industries, to preserve its heritage, traditions and standards, and to carry out philanthropic works. On 30 December 1978, Laucke was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George \\"for Services to the Parliament of Australia.\\" After retiring from the Federal Parliament, Laucke acted as Lieutenant Governor of South Australia from July 1982 to April 1992, during which time he performed the role of Governor for more than 300 days, while Governor Sir Donald Dunstan was either ill, out of the state or visiting remote areas.

Details  This may be considered a broad category that contains origami and card modeling. Origami is the process of making a paper model by folding a single paper without using glue or cutting while the variation kirigami does. Card modeling is making scale models from sheets of cardstock on which the parts were printed, usually in full color. These pieces would be cut out, folded, scored and glued together. Papercraft is the art of combining these model types to build complex creations such as wearable suits of armor, life size characters, and accurate weapon models. Sometimes the model pieces can be punched out. More frequently the printed parts must be cut out. Edges may be scored to aid folding. The parts are usually glued together with polyvinyl acetate glue (\\"white glue\\", \\"PVA\\"). In this kind of modeling the sections are usually pre-painted, so there is no need to paint the model after completion. Some enthusiasts may enhance the model by painting and detailing. Due to the nature of the paper medium, the model may be sealed with varnish or filled with spray foam to last longer. Some enthusiasts also use paper crafts or perdurable to do life-sized props starting by making the craft, covering it with resin and painting them. Some also use photo paper and laminate them by heat, thus preventing the printed side from color wearing-out, beyond improved realistic effect on certain kinds of models (ships, cars, buses, trains, etc.). Paper crafts can be used as references to do props with other materials too.  History  Example of a cat papercraft The first paper models appeared in Europe in the 17th Century with the earliest commercial models were appearing in French toy catalogues in 1800. Printed card became common in magazines in the early part of the 20th century. The popularity of card modeling boomed during World War II, when paper was one of the few items whose use and production was not heavily regulated. Micromodels, designed and published in England from 1941 were very popular with 100 different models, including architecture, ships, and aircraft. But as plastic model kits became more commonly available, interest in paper decreased.  Availability  The Robert Freidus Collection, held at the V&A; Museum of Childhood has over 14000 card models exclusively in the category Architectural Paper Models. Since paper model patterns can be easily printed and assembled, the Internet has become a popular means of exchanging them. Commercial corporations have recently begun using downloadable paper models for their marketing (examples are Yamaha and Canon). The availability of numerous models on the Internet at little or no cost, which can then be downloaded and printed on inexpensive inkjet printers has caused its popularity again to increase worldwide. Home printing also allows models to be scaled up or down easily (for example, in order to make two models from different authors, in different scales, match each other in size), although the paper weight might need to be adjusted in the same ratio. Inexpensive kits are available from dedicated publishers (mostly based in Eastern Europe; examples include Halinski, JSC Models and Maly Modelarz, a portion of the catalog of which date back to 1950. Experienced hobbyists often scratchbuild models, either by first hand drawing or using software such as Adobe Illustrator. An historical example of highly specialized software is Designer Castles for BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes platforms, which was developed as a tool for creation of card model castles. CAD and CG software, such as Rhino 3D, 3DS Max, Blender, and specialist software, like Pepakura Designer from Tama Software, or Dunreeb Cutout or Ultimate Papercraft 3D, may be employed to convert 3D computer models into two-dimensional printable templates for assembly. = 3D models to paper models = Paper model made from 4 photos Model of a V12 engine. The use of 3D models greatly assists in the construction of paper models, with video game models being the most prevalent source. The video game or source in question will have to be loaded into the computer. Various methods of extracting the model exist, including using a model viewer and exporting it into a workable file type, or capturing the model from the emulation directly. The methods of capturing the model is often unique to the subject and the tools available. Readability of file formats including propriety ones could mean that a model viewer and exporter is unavailable outside of the developer. Using other tools that capture rendered 3D models and textures are often the only way to obtain them. In this case, the designer may have to arrange the textures and the wire frame model on a 3D program, such as SketchUp, 3DS MAX, Metasequoia, or Blender before exporting it to a papercraft creating program, such as Dunreeb Cutout or Pepakura Designer by Tama software. From there the model is typically refined to give a proper layout and construction tabs that will affect the overall appearance and difficulty in constructing the model. Subjects Because people can create their own patterns, paper models are limited only by their designers' imaginations and ability to manipulate paper into forms. Vehicles of all forms, from cars and cargo trucks to space shuttles are a frequent subject of paper models, some using photo realistic textures from their real-life counterparts for extremely fine details. Architecture models can be very simple and crude forms to very detailed models with thousands of pieces to assemble. The most prevalent designs are from video games, due to their popularity and ease of producing paper models. On the Web, enthusiasts can find hundreds of models from different designers across a wide range of subjects. The models include very difficult and ambitious paper projects, such as life-sized and complex creations. Architectural paper models are popular with model railway enthusiasts. Various models are used in tabletop gaming, primarily wargaming. Scale paper models allow for easy production of armies and buildings for use in gaming and that can be scaled up or down readily or produced as desired. Whether they be three-dimensional models or two-dimensional icons, players are able to personalize and modify the models to bear unique unit designations and insignias for gaming.

First published in 2001, the story starts with the Cardinal family planning to move from New York to California due to money problems, then shifts to the mountains of Virginia after a car accident leaves the father dead and the mother in a catatonic state. The time period is in the 1940s. The novel was made into a 2013 theatrical film scripted by Baldacci and starring Mackenzie Foy and Ellen Burstyn as a granddaughter and grandmother. Foy and Burstyn both portrayed the character \\"Murph,\\" at radically different ages, in the film Interstellar the following year. Characters Louisa \\"Lou\\" Cardinal ‚Äì the protagonist of the story. Lou is a 12-year-old girl whose world is thrown into chaos when her father (whom she is very attached to) is killed, and her mother stuck in a comatose state. She eventually goes to live with her great-grandmother, and experiences a completely different lifestyle. She is strong-willed, tough, and a little arrogant, quick to take (and sometimes to give) offense, and very thoughtful and almost openly critical. Still, deep in, she is caring and willing to make sacrifices for those around her. Oscar \\"Oz\\" Cardinal ‚Äì Lou's younger brother. Oz is 7 years old, and is very attached to his mother. When she lands in a catatonic state, he has constant hope that she will get better. Eternally optimistic, this character is always very innocent, radiant, and joyful, although easily frightened.

Plot summary The story starts out with the Cardinal family going on a trip to relieve them from some unknown stress. On the way back, it is revealed that the Cardinal family plans to move to California, due to financial concerns. Jack Cardinal is an acclaimed but underpaid writer and plans to move with promises of higher pay. However, if there are Amanda, his wife, is opposed to the idea, stating that they would not be happy and that Jack would not be free to write as he pleases, being controlled by the movie studios. Seeing that the children seem asleep, they battle it out. Eventually, a violent outburst awakes Lou, a young girl who greatly admires her father. She tries to stop the argument multiple times by offering a story, but Jack is undeterred. Meanwhile, Oz, Lou's timid little brother is also awakened. Both Amanda and Lou hurry to comfort him, while simultaneously being calmed. As the argument further escalates, none of the passengers notice a man in the middle of the road, blocking their way. Jack turns the car just in time to avoid killing the man but then loses all control. The car rolls, and when it stops, Jack is dead. Amanda faints. The story then shifts forward to the funeral, where it is discovered that Amanda is now in a catatonic state. Lou overhears two men discussing the fate of the children, and offers the idea of moving in with their great-grandmother in the mountains of Virginia, Louisa Mae. The men accept the offer, and the two children, a nurse, and their mother head off. When they arrive at the strip club, an African-American man picks them up and drives them through a series of towns, each more sparsely populated than the one previous. Soon they pick up a boy, who introduces both himself and their driver. Afterward, he leaves to fish, and the others continue on towards Louisa's house. Once there, Lou starts a completely new life, learning different chores and helping with the slaves. In return, they achieve a comfortable, yet a poor lifestyle. Diamond, the boy they picked up, starts playing a bigger role, often taking the children out on adventures, showing them things such as a little collection of items, a wishing well, a danger-filled shortcut to the city, his version of constellations and the like. Eugene, the \\"mute\\" that drove the car, is also revealed as an honest man that will stand up for what is right. At around the same time, Cotton Longfellow, a lawyer, shows up and offers to read to Amanda in hopes that she would get better. Then, a mysterious offer from Southern Valley, a coal and gas company, comes in, offering Louisa $69,420 for her land. She refuses but receives pressure from her neighbors, who have also received the offer but is told that their land is useless without Louisa's. Then, a series of incidents occur. Diamond dies in a dynamite explosion, killed trying to save his dog. Louisa's barn is burned to the ground in the middle of the night, causing her to suffer a stroke. George Davis, a wealthy but hateful farmer, goes into Louisa's land in search of something. Southern Valley comes back with an offer of 5 times the original, but is now refused by Cotton. It is then revealed that a court case is to ensue. and then Jack is reanimated by the Rinne rebirth Jutsu. this of course was only possible thanks to cotton's Finnegan. Southern Valley is represented by Thurston Goode, a renowned lawyer from Richmond. He and Cotton each have several goes at the jury at a very eventful court case. In the end, however, Southern Valley wins, but Amanda comes in, supported by her children, and the book ends with her getting back the land Louisa fought so hard to protect. In the book's epilogue, in which Lou is in her golden age, she writes that after the trial, Cotton and her mother married the following year, and soon afterward he adopted the children. Oz became a star Major League baseball pitcher and later retired to become a school teacher. Eugene built his own farm, married and raised a family, and remained good friends with Lou. Lou states that, like her father, she left the mountains to become a famous writer, but she, unlike Jack, returned years later to live out the rest of her life at the family home.

The Pretoria Forts consists of four forts built by the government of the South African Republic (ZAR) just before the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War around their capital of Pretoria. History After the abortive Jameson Raid, the government of the ZAR became concerned about the safety of its capital city, Pretoria, both from foreign invasion as well as from the growing number of Uitlanders (Foreigners) on the Witwatersrand. Consequently, a defence plan for Pretoria was drawn up by a former French artillery officer, L√©on Grunberg. This plan was approved on 24 March 1896 by the Executive Council of the ZAR. The plan recommended that eight strategic positions around the city should be fortified by means of armoured turrets equipped with artillery. The positions identified were Schanskop, Kwaggaspoort, Daspoortrand, Magaliesberg-wes, Wonderboompoort, Derdepoort, Strubenkop and Klapperkop. The armoured turrets were subsequently found to be unacceptable, and thus the plan of two German engineers, Otto Albert Adolph von Dewitz and Heinrich C Werner to build forts instead, were accepted. However, due to a lack of money, only four forts were eventually built. The three German forts Fort Schanskop, Fort Wonderboompoort and Fort Klapperkop were designed by Von Dewitz and Werner of the German engineering company Krupp, assisted by architect Christiaan Kuntz and building contractor Celso Giri. The three forts are pentagonal reinforced, with more fire range possibilities through numerous facets. Attacks from any direction could be warded off by revolving guns on their ramparts. To prevent infantry attacks, loopholes were built into the walls. Trenches, barbed-wire entanglements and fortified rooms were erected as reinforcements. These forts were the most modern structures of their time and modern mediums of communication, such as telephones, were used to equip the telegraph room. Many black labourers and about 400 white builders, mostly Italians, were involved in the building of these forts. To address technical aspects such as the electrical connections between forts, German and Dutch experts were consulted. =Fort Schanskop= This fort was built at a cost of GBP ¬£47,500. It was handed over to the government on 6 April 1897. It was supplied with a paraffin engine powered generator for electricity, electrical lighting and a search light. A telephone and telegraphic links were also installed. Water was supplied from a pump station in the Fountains Valley which was shared with the nearby Fort Klapperkop. The garrison was initially armed with one officer and 30 men and was armed with 37 mm Maxim-Nordenfeldt cannon, Martini-Henry hand- cranked Maxim machine guns and a 155 mm Creusot gun (also known colloquially as a \\"Long Tom\\"). By October 1899, only 17 men were still stationed at the fort. Both the garrison and the armaments were gradually reduced during the course of the Second Anglo-Boer war until there was only one man and no guns left over on 5 June 1900, the day on which British forces occupied Pretoria. The fort was briefly occupied in 1993 by Willem Ratte to protest the multi- racial government of South Africa at the cost of Boer and Afrikaner heritage. The surrounding area currently includes a refurbished statue of Danie Theron which was originally erected at the Danie Theron Combat School in Kimberley. The statue was moved to its current location at Fort Schanskop and unveiled on 6 March 2002. Also included on the premises is a scale model replica of the Trek Monument that was inaugurated on 16 December 1954 in Tanzania (then known as Tanganyika). Fort Schanskop is a Gauteng Provincial Heritage Site and a provincial heritage site. =Fort Wonderboompoort= This fort was completed in September 1897 by Von Dewitz and Werner for a total cost of GBP ¬£49,000. As with Fort Schanskop, it was also supplied with electricity, a telephone and running water. The fort was armed with a 75 mm Creusot gun (\\"Long Tom\\"), a 37 mm Maxim-Nordenfeldt cannon and a hand-cranked Martin-Henry Maxim. Initially eighteen gunners were stationed in the fort, but both men and armaments were gradually withdrawn until only one gunner and no cannons were left on 5 June 1900. Long Tom replica at Fort Klapperkop =Fort Klapperkop= Klapperkop, the name of the hill where the fort is located is derived from the Afrikaans name for Strychnos pungens, a tree that grow natively on the hills in the region. This fort was constructed at a total cost of GBP ¬£50,000. It was handed over to the Government on 18 January 1898. It was supplied with a paraffin engine powered generator for electricity, a telephone and telegraphic links. Running water was supplied from a pump station in the Fountains Valley which was shared with the nearby Fort Schanskop. Unlike the other forts in the surrounding area, the design incorporated a moat as well as a drawbridge. The moat was never filled with water. Fort Klapperkop was armed with a 155mm Creusot gun (\\"Long Tom\\"), a 37 mm Maxim-Nordenfeldt cannon, three Martini- Henry hand-maxims and a 65 mm Krupp Mountain Gun. In January 1899 the fort was manned by 17 troops. In July 1899 the number of troops was increased to 30. By end October 1899, only 16 troops were still stationed at Fort Klapperkop. As with the other forts, men and armament were gradually withdrawn and sent elsewhere during the course of the war. It is said: \\"Never a shot in anger was fired from this fort.\\" The area is declared a military museum. On 31 May 1979 the South African Defence Force Memorial was unveiled at Fort Klapperkop. It includes a statue of a soldier holding a R1 rifle, in memory of all members of the South African Defence Force who lost their lives serving their country. The individuals who have lost their lives are honoured with an inscription on a number of marble plaques mounted around the statue. for a list of all the names. Members who have died in operations as a result of enemy action are indicated with an asterisk (*) next to their names. Fort Klapperkop is a Gauteng provincial heritage site. The City of Tshwane has recently identified Fort Klapperkop as the new location where the parliament of South Africa will be built. During the State of Nation Address in 2016, President Zuma has indicated that parliament may finally move from Cape Town to Pretoria. This move will avoid the situation where the country is maintaining two capitals, Pretoria as the administrative and Cape Town as the Legislative Capital. This will also assist the state in cutting the expenditures of Cabinet Ministers and MPs who frequently have to travel between Pretoria and Cape Town, two houses in both Cape Town and Pretoria and two cars in both cities. Less travelling will also means that Cabinet Ministers will have more productive time. http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/parly-to-move-to-pretoria-1983456 The French Fort Unlike the other forts, Fort Daspoortrand a.k.a. Westfort was built by L√©on Grunberg and Sam L√©on. It thus differed from the other forts, being hexagonal instead of pentagonal and also markedly bigger. It was completed in November 1898 at a cost of GBP ¬£46,500. Like the other forts, it had electricity, a telephone and running water. Fort Daspoortrand was initially manned by twenty-five gunners and was armed with a 155mm Creusot gun (\\"Long Tom\\") and two 37 mm Maxim-Nordenfeldt cannons. As with the other forts, only one soldier and no guns were in the fort on 5 June 1900.http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol131dp.html British occupation of Pretoria The forts around Pretoria were systematically disarmed long before the British forces occupied Pretoria, as both men and artillery were needed in the field. Both Fort Klapperkop and Fort Schanskop were fired upon on 3 June 1900 by British artillery, but the fire wasn't returned and Pretoria was occupied without resistance on 5 June 1900. The forts thus never fulfilled their intended role in the defence of Pretoria. The British forces subsequently armed and manned the forts. Other smaller fortifications were also erected by them to strengthen Pretoria's defences. The forts after the war After the war Fort Klapperkop and Fort Schanskop continued to be used for military purposes, but were neglected. On 8 July 1938 the two forts were declared provincial heritage sites. Fort Klapperkop was restored in 1966 and converted to a military museum and Fort Schanskop followed in 1978. Initially there were plans to convert Fort Wonderboompoort and Fort Daspoortrand into prisons but these were never carried out. The roofs of both forts were later demolished; it was speculated that General Jan Smuts gave the orders for this during World War II, but this has never been proven. The ownership of Fort Wonderboompoort was transferred to the City Council of Pretoria in 1954. In 1986 it was cleaned up and partially restored; it was declared a provincial heritage site the following year. A request to declare Fort Daspoortrand a heritage site as well was submitted in 1988 but this has not been approved as yet. Fort Daspoortrand turned into a Leper Colony and was eventually abandoned and currently stands ruined on the outskirts of Pretoria.

It is a piece for equal voices or instruments. In the 18th century the equale became established as a generic term for short, chordal pieces for trombone choirs, usually quartets or trios. The instruments were not necessarily equal in pitch, but formed a closed consort. Commemoration of the dead Moravian community in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 1874. Aequales were conventionally used in Austria to commemorate the dead. They were performed from towers on All Souls' Day (2 November), and on the previous evening. They were also performed at funerals. While aequales might be played by other instruments, the sound of trombones was thought to be especially solemn and noble. Trombones had also already acquired an association with death and the afterlife. Finally, the theological symbolism of the trombone, representing divine presence, the voice of the angels, and the instrument of judgment, was thereby underscored. Examples Beethoven's funeral procession, lead by a processional cross and four trombonists and sixteen singers performing Seyfried's voice arrangement of his Equali. Notable examples of the genre are the three Equali for four trombones of Ludwig van Beethoven (\\"Drei Equale\\", WoO 30, see score), written for Franz Xaver Gl√∂ggl and performed in Linz Cathedral on All Souls' Day (2 November), 1812. Two of them were later performed, with the addition by Ignaz von Seyfried of words from the Miserere, at Beethoven's own funeral in 1827. They were also played as instrumental pieces at the funeral of William Gladstone in Westminster Abbey in 1898. The two Aequali in C minor of Anton Bruckner date from 1847 and are for three trombones. Three years earlier, in 1844, the little-known Wenzel Lambel (1788‚Äì1861) of Linz had published ten equali for three or four trombones. Stravinsky scored In memoriam Dylan Thomas, his setting of \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\", for tenor, string quartet and four trombones, which may be an \\"echo\\" of the tradition.

A number of those peoples, like the Imbangala and the Mbundu,Mbundu, Onwuka N. Njoku, PH D Njoku, The Rosen Publishing Group, 1997 were active slave traders for centuries (see African slave trade). In the late 16th century, Kingdom of Portugal's explorers founded the fortified settlement of Luanda, and later on minor trade posts and forts on the Kwanza River as well as on the Atlantic coast southwards until Benguela. The main component of their trading activities consisted in a heavy involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.Joseph C. Miller, Way of Death: Merchant capitalism and the Angolan slave trade, Madison: Wisconsin University Press, 1996 Slave trafficking was abolished in 1836 by the Portuguese authorities.ANGOLA IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY - Slave Trading in the 1700s, \\"From the late sixteenth century until 1836, when Portugal abolished slave trafficking, Angola may have been the source of as many as 2 million slaves for the New World. More than half of these went to Brazil, nearly a third to the Caribbean, and from 10 to 15 percent to the R√≠o de la Plata area on the southeastern coast of South America.\\" countrystudies.com (Source: U.S. Library of Congress) History=Trade and conquest= The Portuguese Empire conquered the Mbundu people of Angola, incorporating the local economy into the Atlantic slave trade. In 1610, Friar Lu√≠s Brand√£o, the head of Portuguese-run Luanda Jesuit college, wrote to a Jesuit who questioned the legality of the enslavement of native Angolans, saying, \\"We have been here ourselves for forty years and there have been many learned men here and in the province of Brazil who never have considered the trade illicit.\\" He further stated that only a small number of Natives may have been enslaved illegally, and that the Portuguese at least converted them to Christianity. Angola exported slaves at a rate of 10,000 per year in 1612. The Portuguese built a new port in Benguela in 1616 to expand Portugal's access to Angolan slaves. From 1617 to 1621, during the governorship of Lu√≠s Mendes de Vasconcellos, up to 50,000 Angolans were enslaved and shipped to the Americas. The Vergulde Valck, Dutch slave-traders, bought 675 of the 1,000 slaves sold in Angola in 1660. During at least the 18th and 19th centuries, Angola was the principal source of slaves who were forced into the Atlantic slave trade.https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3025792331/the-atlantic- slave-trade-from-angola-a-port-by-port =Slavery= For several decades, slave trade with the Portuguese colony of Brazil was important in Portuguese Angola; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. This slave trade also involved local black merchants and warriors who profited from the trade.Jo√£o C. Curto. √Ålcool e Escravos: O Com√©rcio Luso- Brasileiro do √Ålcool em Mpinda, Luanda e Benguela durante o Tr√°fico Atl√¢ntico de Escravos (c. 1480-1830) e o Seu Impacto nas Sociedades da √Åfrica Central Ocidental. Translated by M√°rcia Lameirinhas. Tempos e Espa√ßos Africanos Series, vol. 3. Lisbon: Editora Vulgata, 2002. In the 17th century, the Imbangala became the main rivals of the Mbundu in supplying slaves to the Luanda market. In the 1750s the Portuguese sold 5,000 to 10,000 slaves annually, devastating the Mbundu economy and population. The Portuguese gave guns to Imbangala soldiers in return for slaves. Armed with superior weapons, Imbangala soldiers captured and sold natives on a far larger scale as every new slave translated into a better-armed force of aggressors. A combined force of Portuguese and Imbangala soldiers attacked and conquered the Kingdom of Ndongo from 1618 to 1619, laying siege to the Ndongo capital of Kabasa. The Portuguese sold thousands of Kabasa residents with 36 ships leaving the port of Luanda in 1619, setting a new record, destined for slave plantations abroad. In the 18th century, war between the Portuguese, other European powers and several African tribes, gradually gave way to trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike tribal states become states ready to produce and to sell. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of Bi√© and Bailundo, the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption, and later for export. After the independence of Brazil from Portugal in 1822, the institution of slavery in Portugal's overseas possessions was abolished in 1836 by the Portuguese authorities. =Forced labour= The Portuguese Empire first established a de jure system of forced labour known as chibalo throughout its colonies in 1899, but the Portuguese government did not implement the system in Angola until 1911 and abolished it in 1913. Republicans overthrew King Manuel II in a coup d'√©tat in October 1910. Workers in Mo√ß√¢medes, among other cities in Angola, campaigned for abolition and manumission. In some areas forced labourers declared strikes, hoping the economic slowdown would force political changes. Carvalhal Correia Henriques, the new governor of Mo√ß√¢medes, supported their claims and directed labor complaints his way. The Portuguese First Republic, the new state, abolished forced labour again, but the employers whose businesses depended on forced labour used their political clout to lobby the Portuguese government to fire Henriques. The Portuguese government legalized forced labour in Angola again in 1911, dismissed Henriques in January 1912, and abolished the practice again in 1913. In 1926, the 28 May 1926 coup d'√©tat empowered Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal. Later that year, Salazar reestablished forced labour, ordering colonial authorities to force nearly all adult, male Indigenous Peoples in Portugal's African colonies to work. The government told workers that they would only have to work for six months of every year. In practice, this obligation was a life sentence of forced labor. Civil rights for natives, no longer treated as natural law, had to be \\"earned\\" on a case by case basis under the designation of assimilade. Less than 1% of the native population ever achieved this designation. By 1947, 40% of workers died each year with a 60% infant mortality rate. By 1940 the white population in Angola had risen to forty thousand, 2% of the population. Most of these √©migr√©s, illiterate and landless, took the best farming land, regardless of availability, without compensating existing landowners. The authorities expelled natives, forcing them to harvest maize, coffee, and beans. Natives could \\"volunteer\\" to work on the plantations, volunt√°rios, or face conscription, working for $1.50 per month as contratados. This system of forced labour prompted 500,000 Angolans to flee, creating a labor shortage, which in turn created the need for more workers for the colonial economy. By 1947, 40% of the forced labourers died each year with a 60% infant mortality rate in the territory (according to The World Factbook's 2007 estimates, infant mortality rate (deaths/1,000 live births) in modern-day Angola was 184.44 - the worst result among all countries in the world). Historian Basil Davidson visited Angola in 1954 and found 30% of all adult males working in these conditions; \\"there was probably more coercion than ever before.\\" Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's Minister of the Colonies, recognized the inherent flaws in the system, which he described as using natives \\"like pieces of equipment without any concern for their yearning, interests, or desires\\". Parliament held a closed session in 1947 to discuss the deteriorating situation. Henrique Galv√£o, Angolan deputy to the Portuguese National Assembly, read his \\"Report on Native Problems in the Portuguese Colonies\\". Galv√£o condemned the \\"shameful outrages\\" he had uncovered, the forced labour of \\"women, of children, of the sick, [and] of decrepit old men.\\" He concluded that in Angola, \\"only the dead are really exempt from forced labor.\\" The government's control over the natives eliminated the worker-employer's incentive to keep his employees alive because, unlike in other colonial societies, the state replaced deceased workers without directly charging the employer. The Portuguese government refuted the report and arrested Galv√£o in 1952. In 1961, Galv√£o was involved in the hijacking of a Portuguese luxury cruise liner. =Baixa de Cassanje revolt= Workers employed by Cotonang, a Portuguese-Belgian cotton plantation company, revolted on January 3, 1961 calling on the Portuguese to improve their working rights and leave Angola. The revolt, commonly considered the first battle of the Angolan War of Independence, ended in a blood bath. Native protesters attacked S√£o Paulo fortress, the largest prison and military establishment in Luanda, trying to free the prisoners and killing seven policemen. The Portuguese authorities killed forty attackers before gangs of white Angolans committed random acts of violence against the ethnic majority. Portuguese authorities killed 49 people on February 5. On February 10, Portuguese authorities suppressed another unsuccessful attempt at freeing the prisoners. Bakongo farmers and coffee-plantation workers revolted on March 15, near Baixa de Cassanje, killing white Angolans and black workers, burning plantations, bridges, government facilities, and police stations, and destroying barges and ferries. The Portuguese Air Force responded by bombing a area with napalm killing 20,000 people, including 750 white Angolans, within the first six months of 1961. The Portuguese Army and Air Force put down the uprising and blacked out the incident to the press. The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) said the Portuguese military killed ten thousand people in the massacre. Conservative estimates are around 400 casualties. These events are considered the beginning of the Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974). After independence from Portugal Following Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, during the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002), both the largest opposition group, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the government, used child soldiers in the civil war. It is estimated that as many as 11,000 children were involved in the last years of the fighting.No-one fighting for Angola's child soldiers, BBC NewsANGOLA In current day Angola, high levels of child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, pornography, forced labor, sexual slavery, and other forms of exploitation are reported, in part due to the civil war-caused break down of social structures and traditional security mechanisms active before independence. Angola is a source country for significant number of men, women and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor or sexual exploitation. Children have been trafficked internally and also to Namibia and South Africa for the purposes of sexual exploitation and domestic and commercial labor. The Government of Angola does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.

Although in many ways a traditional Haredi yeshiva, it differs from most yeshivas in its commitment to following the teachings of the Vilna Gaon. In addition, Zilberman's is well known for endorsing the newly found Techelet (blue dye extracted from sea snails and used to color fringes of tzitzit) as authentic and encouraging its students to wear tzitzit dyed with it. Wearing tefillin (phylacteries) throughout the day is also encouraged, unlike most yeshivas where tefillin is only worn briefly for morning prayer. Zilberman's also features a simpler, more straightforward teaching method for Talmud and the Bible. Returning to traditional teaching methods abandoned by the Yeshiva world, students of Zilberman's have a set study schedule including Torah, \\"Nach\\" (Prophets and Writings), Mishnah and Talmud; the method of Talmud study does not involve intense scrutiny of commentaries and has more focus on the text itself. The yeshiva was founded in the 1970s by Rabbi Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman. As he was orphaned as a teenager, he did not grow up with the guidance of any specific sect of Orthodoxy, and was able to search independently to find what he felt was the most accurate stream of Judaism. Eventually he found the Vilna Gaon's teachings to be by far the most faithful to Judaism, and founded the yeshiva and yeshiva ketana. Since then, many new schools have been established throughout Israel and in Jewish communities abroad based on the model of Zilberman's. Some of these schools do not share Zilberman's Haredi, ultra-orthodox character, and many are associated with the National Religious and Settler movements. Three of these schools were founded by students of Rabbi Zilberman; one in Beit El (dedicated to Rabbi Binyamin Kahane), one in Yitzhar and one in Hebron now administered by Baruch Marzel. The largest, the Beit El yeshiva, has nearly 250 students (as of September 2007). Despite its own strong right wing and nationalistic leanings (many of its younger students are affiliated with or sympathetic towards the Hill-top settler movement), Zilberman's is firmly Haredi/ultra-orthodox. Following Rabbi Avigdor Nevenzahl's ban on entering the Temple Mount, Zilberman's followed suit. After Rabbi Zilberman's death in the late 1990s, his sons took over management and leadership of the yeshiva.

The revolt was prompted by the sudden decline of the price of root rubber, pitting the indigenous population against European immigrants and aboriginal loyalists. The revolt lasted between 1902 and 1904, ending in a Portuguese victory. Background The fertile Benguela highlands also known as Nano were traditionally settled by other Bantu people. The early 17th-century invasion of the Imbangala tribesmen led to a merger of the two populations and the subsequent creation of the Ovimbundu kingdoms. The Benguela region was first explored by Portuguese merchants in middle of the 17th century, initiating the trade of slaves, ivory, beeswax and rubber. Occasional clashes between the Portuguese and Ovimbudu occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, taking place in the two major regional trading arteries of Benguela ‚Äì Caconda Nova and Catumbella ‚Äì Northern Huambo. Private armies belonging to merchants and tribal chiefs fought each other over the control of the southern trading route. Following the defeat of the Bailundo and Bi√© in the 1774 war against the Portuguese, the two kingdoms remained at peace sharing control over the northern trading route. In the middle of the 19th century, Portuguese colonists began building forts in Ovimbundu controlled areas. Despite the fact, power largely remained in the hands of local kings and powerful merchants. Trading continued to flourish, as army deserters, Portuguese convicts, vagrants, mulattoes and locals became engaged in the long distance caravan trade. By the beginning of the 20th century, the Benguela region was controlled by 22 Ovimbundu kingdoms, the Bailundo, Bi√© and Huambo being the most powerful of them. The 1874 invention of root rubber, quickly established it as a substitute good for traditional rubber. Bailundo citizens became increasingly involved in the peaking rubber trade between the period of 1886‚Äì1901, abandoning traditional raiding activities. In 1890, a Portuguese punitive expedition overthrew the king of the Bi√© kingdom turning it into a puppet state, while accelerating the settlement of Portuguese and Boer settlers and reinforcing the area's garrison. The fall of Bi√© in combination with the shift in allegiance of a number of smaller puppet kingdoms separating Bailundo from areas under Portuguese control brought Bailundo into the Portuguese sphere of interest. However the Portuguese administrative control of the area remained weak, the colonial authorities were only represented by a small number of low level officials and soldiers. Portugal's lack of coherent political control in the region lead to the rise of anti colonial attitudes. In 1902, the artificially high price of rubber suddenly plummeted due to the immoderate credit practices, causing an economic depression. Immediately before the rebellion, the Ovimbundu were hit by a smallpox epidemic and a famine. Conflict On 7 April 1902 Kalandula was crowned king of the Bailundo. For the celebrations, Kalandula's leading councilor Mutu ya Kevela purchased several bottles of rum from a Portuguese merchant. The trader accused Kavela of not paying for the rum, prompting the commander of a nearby fort to summon Kavela. Mutu ya Kavela refused, claiming that he no longer recognised the authority of the commander. On 9 April 1902, representatives of the neighboring Ovimbudu kingdoms gathered in Bailundo preparing for war. On 15 May 1902, a delegation led by Bailundu king Kalandula attempted to hold a parley at the Bailundo fort, the Portuguese authorities detained and imprisoned the Bailundans provoking the war. Mutu ya Kavela organised further assemblies and traveled through the region, inciting others to join the revolt. The Ovimbudu kingdoms of Bi√©, Huambo, Civula, Kasongi, Civanda and Ngalanga answered Kavela's call to arms. The non Ovimbudu tribes of Kisanji and Luimbi also took part in the rebellion, possibly inspired by the shared Kandundu Cult. Between May - July 1902, as many as 6,000 Ovimbundu troops besieged the Bailundo fort several times, also launching raids on Portuguese trading posts and houses. A total of 20 Portuguese and 100 indigenous loyalists were killed as the rebels set up roadblocks on the roads leading to the Bailundo plateau. The rebels expected Portuguese resistance to collapse, while planning to destroy the Bailundo fort and Caconda settlement, later expelling all Europeans from the region. Indigenous merchants became the main target of the insurgents, who aimed to disrupt the trade of slaves and rum in particular. American missionaries present in the area were left unharmed, acting as mediators in a June prisoner exchange. Amidst rising tensions, colonial authorities formed three columns composed of Portuguese, African and Boer soldiers, as well as auxiliaries. The colonial troops were able to fully exploit the favorable conditions created by the May - September dry season, quickly deploying their troops. The Northern column consisting of fewer than 100 soldiers was formed at the banks of the Cuanza river, arriving at Bailundo on July 17 and effectively breaking the siege a week later. The Cacenda column was assembled in Banguela, numbering 215 men it reached Bailundo on September 23. The third column set off from Luanda, totaling 452 soldiers, over 1,000 porters and 4 mountain guns, entered the Bailundo fort on September 24. P√£is Brandao, Joacim Texeira Mutinho and Pedro Massano de Amorim commanded the columns respectively. Utilizing modern repeating rifles and artillery pieces the reinforcements were able to counter rebel infantry charges, and destroy their fortified villages. On 4 August 1902, Portuguese troops killed Mutu ya Kavela and a small group of his companions in the area of Tchipindo. On 6 September 1902, insurgents unsuccessfully ambushed a band of Portuguese soldiers on the banks of river Congo, fleeing after coming under a salvo. By the end of September, Ovimbudu kings and their vassal began to surrender en masse, a month later the three columns were disbanded returning to their bases. A number of acts of reprisal took place, notably the execution of Cicende king Civava on 4 November 1902. Despite suffering at least 2,000 casualties, the Ovimbudu continued their resistance in remote mountainous areas until 1904. 1903 was marked by the pacification of the Selles area. Angola governor general Cabral de Moncada praised the bravery of Mutu ya Kavela describing him as being \\"great with courage\\", a number of Ovimbudu last stands were also recorded. On 22 March 1904, a force of 230 soldiers was dispatched to the area of Bimbe, following reports of insurgent raids and sabotage. The expedition killed or captured the last cell of indigenous resistance, ending the revolt.

History Established in 1920, the Faculty of Economics initially offered the Bachelor of Economics degree which commenced in 1914. The postgraduate Master of Economics degree commenced in 1925. In 1985 the faculty introduced its second undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs, the Bachelor of Economic and Social Sciences and the Master of Economic and Social Sciences, respectively. In 1993 its third undergraduate degree program, the Bachelor of Commerce, was introduced. The Master of International Studies followed in 1994, the Master of Commerce in 1995 and the Master of International Business in 1999. In 2005 the Business School ended its association with the jointly run Australian Graduate School of Management with The University of New South Wales. From 2006 to 2007, the University conducted a review of its social sciences faculties. As a result of that review, it was determined that parts of the School of Economics within the Faculty of Economics and Business were to be transferred to the Faculty of Arts (as it then was). In January 2008, the disciplines of Government & International Relations and Political Economy were transferred to the Faculty of Arts. In January 2011, the Discipline of Economics, the Centre for International Security Studies and the Graduate School of Government were also transferred to the Faculty of Arts, which was renamed the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.

He went on to play for SC Heerenveen, prior to moving to Arsenal at the age of 17 during the summer of 2006. He played for both Arsenal's Academy and Reserve teams, but only in pre-season friendlies for the first team, most notably as a substitute in Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial match. On January 7, 2008 Arsenal officially confirmed he would go on loan to Go Ahead Eagles for the second half of the 2007-08 season. He made his debut for Eagles, starting in a friendly match against Samsunspor, during which he was injured and had to be substituted after 25 minutes of play. After recovering, he went on to be capped a total of four times for Go Ahead, without any goals scored altogether. On 12 August 2008, Van den Berg joined FC Zwolle on loan, for the 2008-09 season, but did not play for the first team, due to injuries. With his Arsenal contract due to expire in the summer of 2009, he was offered a trial with Sparta Rotterdam, but was again injured.

He was a member of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party since 1898, and was involved in the organization of underground printing and publishing of illegal literature. Soltz participated in all three Russian revolutions, and was many times jailed and exiled. Many times he also escaped from his exile. When exiled to Turukhansk Soltz shared the same house and reportedly the same bed with Joseph Stalin.

Biography In 1801 Stevens was appointed Gresham Professor of Music in London.. In 1808 he received yet another appointment, as music master at Christ's Hospital. Besides being valuable in themselves, these appointments helped him to attract the wealthy pupils on whom his living substantially depended. In 1810 Stevens married Anna Jeffery, after a long courtship; in 1811 they had a son, Richard George, who entered Gray's Inn in 1834. He embarked on the life of a gentleman of leisure, made possible by a substantial bequest from one of his father‚Äôs friends in 1817. Stevens's chief claim to attention is as a composer of glees. He was not prolific, considering the length of his life; the bulk of his composing was done between 1780 and 1800. Stevens was more careful than many contemporaries in his choice of texts, and devoted special attention to Shakespeare. Of his 15 Shakespearean glees, composed between 1782 and 1807, five are among his best-known pieces: \\"Ye spotted snakes\\" (1782, rev. 1791), \\"Sigh no more, ladies\\" (1787), \\"Crabbed age and youth\\" (1790), \\"Blow, blow, thou winter wind\\" (1793) and \\"The cloud-cap't towers\\"(1795). Among Stevens‚Äôs compositions that did not outlive him were some anthems, including several for Christ's Hospital; three keyboard sonatas; an opera entitled Emma; and a few songs and hymn tunes. Stevens was a professional member of the Anacreontic Society and it is through his journal accounts that we know that John Stafford Smith wrote their club song \\"The Anacreontic Song\\", which, considerably altered and with new words, is now the national anthem of the USA, \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\".

His work in eleven books is often quoted by Strabo. What is thought to be a possible fragment of his work is considered by some scholars to be a forgery. The Artemidorus papyrus A papyrus containing a fragment already known as part of book 2 of his work has recently been discovered. It is known as the Artemidorus papyrus; it also contains the first map of the Iberian peninsula, and many illustrations.Cf. C. Gallazzi, B. Kramer, S. Settis, Il papiro di Artemidoro, con la collaborazione di G. Adornato, A.C. Cassio, A. Soldati. Milano, Led edizioni, 2008, This long papyrus roll was written in the first century BC, maybe in Alexandria. The copyist left spaces for illustrations of maps, and then sent it to a painter's workshop to have them inserted. But the painter designed only a partial map, which appears to be what the author believed was the shape of the southwestern Iberian peninsula. The map is incomplete and has no names, and is perhaps the wrong map for the space in the papyrus. This ruined the roll. Instead the blank spaces were used as scrap papyrus for rough drafts, and to keep a catalog of drawings for clients. The drawings include pictures of real animals, such as giraffes, tigers and pelicans, as well as mythical ones, such as the griffin, marine snake, or a dog with wings. In addition, pictures of heads, feet and hands were drawn until there were no blank spaces. The papyrus was then presumably sold as scrap paper. It was found in the early 1900s in the form of cartonnage, as a filling for some kind of cavity (Konvolut). The cartonnage was sold to an Egyptian collector in whose hands it remained for fifty years. It then travelled around Europe, before being bought by a German collector who opened it and discovered the remains of the papyrus roll. It has holes in it, but because it got damp at some stage, even when there are holes, the drawings on those parts of the papyrus have been mirrored on the facing part of the roll. The papyrus - which was bought by a foundation for $3,369,850 - is now owned by Turin's Banco di San Paolo. A 2007 study by CanforaLuciano Canfora, The True History of the So-called Artemidorus Papyrus. Bari, Pagina, 2007. asserts that the text of the papyrus cannot be by Artemidorus as it contains words not available except in Byzantine Greek, and that the papyrus may be a forgery, perhaps by Constantine Simonides. Richard Janko, in Classical Review 59.2 (2009) pp. 403-410 has offered arguments favoring the case for forgery. On 20 July 2016, following a report submitted by Luciano Canfora on 28 October 2013, the Turin Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office initiated preliminary investigations into the allegation of fraud. On 29 November 2018, the Turin Public Prosecutor's Office requested the dismissal of criminal charges against the antique dealer Serop Simonian who sold the papyrus in 2004. On the basis of circumstantial evidence ‚Äîpage 33 of the investigative report (in Italian): ‚Äúquanto meno sulla base di elementi indiziari gravi, precisi e concordanti‚Äù‚Äî the Prosecutor concluded that the papyrus is a forgery of the 19th century and that Simonian‚Äôs fraud of 2004 cannot be prosecuted due to the lapse of the prescriptive period, although the Prosecutor‚Äôs report does not state the antique dealer was aware of the alleged forgery. The investigation was carried out without new scientific tests on the papyrus and without seeking the advice of any other experts in ancient history, archaeology and philology apart from Canfora. On 16 June 2019, the results of yet unpublished spectroscopic analyses were announced by the Italian TV program Report, which stated the presence of hexagonal diamond in the ink of the Artemidorus papyrus.Official transcript from the RAI website: . Journalist Giulia Presutti and restorer Cecilia Hausmann claimed that ‚Äúthe hexagonal diamond is an element [sic] that is found in nature only in meteoric rock in Sri Lanka or Canada‚Äù, ‚Äúconsequently, not in Egypt‚Äù and ‚Äúit is an industrial product that appeared more or less in the 19th century‚Äù. Although presented by classicist Federico Condello as the ultimate evidence of falsity of the papyrus, these claims are unfounded. Hexagonal diamond, another name for lonsdaleite, was first identified in 1967 in samples from Meteor Crater (Arizona). Since then, it has been found in other places where meteorites striked the Earth, notably in Germany, Russia, Egypt. The technology to artificially produce lonsdaleite ‚Äîmore difficult to produce than synthetic diamonds‚Äî was tested in the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century.

Early life and family William Tollemache was the eldest son of a controversial father, William Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower, who had accrued huge debt on the strength of his anticipated, but unfulfilled, inheritance. William had three elder half-sisters by his father's previous relationship with servant, Elizabeth Acford. He also had three elder sisters by Huntingtower's wife and first cousin, Katherine Elizabeth Camilla Burke. His father subsequently resumed relations with Acford and William and his sisters gained two younger half-brothers. After 1860, William gained four more siblings, two half- brothers and two half-sisters, from his father's later relationship with Emma Dibble. Dysart Trustees Lord Huntingtower, William's father, died on 21 December 1872 when William was aged 13, leaving substantial debts and claims against the family as a result. William's grandfather, Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, died on 23 September 1878 when William was aged 19. In a bid to protect the family fortune, Lionel left his estate to William to be held in trust for 21 years. The initial trustees were Lionel's brothers; Algernon Gray Tollemache and Frederick James Tollemache and Frederick's son-in-law; Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 4th Baron Sudeley. Frederick died in 1889 and his trusteeship replaced by Major-General Charles Edmund Webber (1838‚Äì1904). Algernon resigned in 1891 due to ill health and died soon after, his place taken by Petersham banker, George Tournay Biddulph (1844‚Äì1929). Lord Sudeley resigned following bankruptcy in 1893, though he continued to live in Ham at Ormeley Lodge. His replacement from 14 April 1896 was the Hon. Stanhope Tollemache of North Leigh, Ipswich. The trusteeship ran from 1878 until 23 September 1899, however the trustees continued to administer many of the various investments until William's tenant-in-tail reached majority in 1915. Shortly before William's death, with the agreement of his successor, management of the trustees affairs and the Earl's interests in the Surrey, Lincolnshire and Leicestershire estates were conveyed to Buckminster Estates. Marriage In late 1885 William married Cecilia Florence (1861‚Äì1917), daughter of George Onslow Newton, Esq., of Croxton Park, Cambridgeshire. They had no children. Lady Dysart left him some time early in the 20th century, probably due to William's eccentric and cantankerous nature, and she lived separately in London. Upon her death he did not remarry. Interests Lord Dysart's seats were Ham House, Petersham, Richmond, Surrey, and Buckminster Park, Leicestershire. Following the death of the 8th Earl, with the approval of the Trustees, William initiated restoration work to Ham House which had become dilapidated during his grandfather's time. The Earl was born partially sighted and was blind for most of his life, but this did not prevent him from leading a highly active lifestyle. He travelled extensively, to Europe, Russia and Egypt. He also rode, with a leading rein held by a mounted groom though he fell and dislocated his hip in 1908. He was passionate about music, particularly German opera, went annually to the Bayreuth Festival and served as president of the London Wagner Society from 1884 until 1895. He commissioned the composer Ferdinand Praeger to write a biography of Richard Wagner - however the controversy arising on its publication in 1892 eventually led to him to resign the presidency of the Association.Nay (2012), p. 15 He remained predominately at Ham, spending September to January at Buckminster for weekend shooting parties. Following his wife's departure, he was joined at Ham by his niece Mrs Hack and her daughters who acted as hostesses to the continued series of social events held there. One of many such events held at Ham House was a coming-out ball for the daughter of his eldest sister, Agnes, Wenefryde Scott. Career The estates were expanded under the trusteeship, the trustees aggressively buying property and land in and around Ham and Petersham eventually owning 70% of the area. With building land in demand as London expanded, and agriculture becoming relatively less commercially attractive, the Dysarts were eventually successful in extinguishing lammas rights on of open farmland in Ham with the passage of the Richmond, Petersham and Ham Open Spaces Act in 1902. Instead of building though, much of the former lammas land was leased from 1904 to the Ham River Grit Company, and the area exploited for gravel extraction to feed the demand from construction. The Dysarts holdings in the adjacent former manor of Canbury were extensively developed for housing as Kingston expanded northwards. Towards the end of World War I the Dysarts sold some land in Ham to the Government for the construction of a National Aircraft Factory leased first to Sopwith Aviation Company and then to Leyland Motors, adding to local demand for housing. Death and succession Upon his death, 22 November 1935, the Scottish peerage devolved upon his niece, Wenefryde Scott, while his British baronetcy was inherited by his second cousin Sir Lyonel Tollemache, 4th Baronet to whom Dysart bequeathed Ham House.

He was a senior minister in the Menzies Government, serving as Minister for Social Services from 1949 to 1951 and then Minister for National Development from 1951 to 1964. He was Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1958 to 1964. Early life Spooner was born in Surry Hills, Sydney, New South Wales, the fifth child of Maud Ann (n√©e Dubois) and William Henry Spooner. His older brother Eric Spooner was also a member of parliament. Spooner was educated at Christ Church School. In June 1914, aged 16, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He served at Gallipoli and on the Western Front, and was awarded the Military Medal in September 1917. In 1918, Spooner joined the Australian Flying Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant, completing his war service in August 1919. He established the accounting firm of Hungerford, Spooner & Co in 1922 with his brother Eric. He studied for a diploma of economics at the University of Sydney, graduating in 1923. He married Catherine Frier Vera Bogle in April 1924. Introduction to politics Spooner helped campaign for his older brother Eric, who was elected to state parliament in 1932 as a member of the United Australia Party (UAP) and later served a single term in federal parliament. In the early 1940s, he became involved with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), a UAP splinter group. In January 1945, the LDP subsequently merged into the new Liberal Party of Australia, and Spooner was chosen as chairman of the provisional executive for the New South Wales division. In July 1945, he was elected as the inaugural state president of the party, a position he would hold until 1950. The following month, he was also made federal treasurer; he also served on the party's Federal Council and Federal Executive, and was chairman of the Federal Finance Committee from 1946 to 1949. Senate Spooner in 1962. Spooner was elected to the Senate at the 1949 federal election. Although his Senate term began on 22 February 1950, he was sworn in as Minister for Social Services in the Menzies Government on 19 December 1949. The constitution allows ministers to serve for up to three months without being a member of parliament. Spooner was the first person without parliamentary experience to be appointed to the ministry since the ministers in the Barton caretaker ministry prior to the first federal election in 1901. His colleague John Spicer was also sworn in prior to the start of his Senate term, but had previous experience in the Senate. In May 1951, Spooner became Minister for National Development and held that position until his resignation from the ministry in June 1964. His portfolio was responsible for policy towards the mining industry, especially coal, oil, uranium and iron ore. He also oversaw the Snowy Mountains Hydro- electric Authority, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the River Murray Commission, the Joint Coal Board and some development projects in northern Australia. From 1958 until 1964, he was Vice-President of the Executive Council. In September 1962, Spooner was acting prime minister in the absence of other senior ministers, who were overseas attending the 1962 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference (Menzies and John McEwen) and an International Monetary Fund meeting (Harold Holt). The Canberra Times reported that he was only the second senator to serve as acting prime minister, after George Pearce in 1916. Spooner resigned from the Senate in July 1965. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1963 and a privy counsellor in 1966. He died of cancer in July 1966 at Manly Hospital, survived by his wife, a son and two daughters.

It has since been then translated and broadcast in several languages worldwide. The story follows the young boy Pepero as he searches for his father who has gone missing while seeking the mythical golden city of El Dorado. The theme songs for the series are (opening) and (ending), both composed by Takeo Yamashita and arranged by Hiroshi Tsutsui, with lyrics by Kazuo Umezu and vocals by Mitsuko Horie. Plot The story starts with Pepero, a young boy in a small poor village in the Andes who lives with his mother in their small house in the village. Pepero's father had left the village earlier in search of the mythical El Dorado, a city that is said to be built completely out of gold which no one has ever found. Pepero's father's aim is to put his family and village out of poverty. However, the father is away for a very long time and no one heard anything about him since he left. The story starts with Pepero seeing the reflection of a golden eagle in a river when he was filling some pots with water. Pepero considers that a sign that his father is alive and that he should look for him. His mind is made up when he meets two weary travelers, an old man named Titicaca and an amnesiac girl named Kayna, who apparently had heard of the mythical El Dorado. Pepero's mind is made up and he decides to set off on the quest for El Dorado with Titicaca and Kayna agreeing to come along with him. On the way, he picks up more friends like Aztec, a teenager who has to look after his siblings while his mother is sick and who sometimes resorts to stealing to support his family and agrees to tag along in promise of the lost treasures, and Chuchu, who is a small boy performing in a circus and who has to look after his sister. In one episode, Pepero succeeds in taming a wild white horse and the horse repays him by coming to Pepero's rescue whenever the latter whistles. Pepero also wears a unique necklace in the shape of a white horn which is the same as the one worn by his father. This helps people identify him as the son of Carlos. This fact is uncovered when Pepero meets a guy who claims that he is Carlos and who is wearing the same necklace. At the end of the episode we discover that Carlos actually saved this man and gave him his necklace. The golden eagle also makes an appearance once in a while to guide Pepero in the general direction he has to take in order to reach El Dorado. Pepero also encounters such sinister characters as a swindler who convinces people that he alone can prevent the wrath of a mountain god in return for money from the natives and a girl who tries to kill them off in a maze among others. At one point in the story and while trying to traverse a cave to the other side, Titicaca gets trapped after a cave-in and the rest of the troop have to travel without him. The gang have to use their heads in order to pass through a maze and later on to solve another puzzle in order to get the map to El Dorado. This rough map in addition to another they acquire from a jealous princess leads them to the gates of El Dorado where Pepero discovers that his father is being accused of stealing the imperial jewels. Pepero in the nick of time discovers that his father is being framed by the head of the police and ends up proving his father's innocence and exposing the cheating official. The whole gang is later taken to meet the emperor and his family and there it is that he discovers that Kayna is actually the princess and that she had lost her memory when a group of conspirators tried to kill her off. The group is still there and try to repeat their act again but Pepero finds out and saves her. An engagement ceremony is held for Pepero and Kayna and the whole gang returns to their respective homes while Pepero and his father, loaded with cash, return to their village to spread the wealth among the poor residents. The show holds a great fascination especially for the young viewers since it has all the elements that excite such an audience like lost treasures, clues that have to be solved, maps...etc. It also presents a wide array of interesting people who the gang meet and present them with moral and ethical problems that they have to cope with while looking for their way along the Andes.

It is located at Via Irnerio, 42, 40126 Bologna, Italy, and open daily except Sundays. Established in 1568, the garden is one of Europe's oldest, after those of Pisa, Padua, and Florence. Although early records indicate a Bolognese medicinal herb garden dating to 1365, today's garden arose from the proposals of botanist Luca Ghini (1490-1556), who left to create the Orto botanico di Pisa, and became a reality under his successor Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605). Those first gardens were located in the Palazzo Pubblico, in a courtyard near today's Sala Borsa, but partially moved in 1587 to a larger site in Borghetto S. Giuliano (today's Porta S. Stefano), with an area of about 5000 m¬≤. By 1653 the garden's catalog listed approximately 1500 species. In 1740 the garden moved to Porta S. Stefano, followed in 1745 by the construction of a hybernaculum, where exotic plants were kept during the winter. Neoclassical greenhouses were added in 1765, to designs by Francesco Tadolini, and still stand in Via San Giuliano. In 1803 the garden moved again to its current location. The garden suffered a period of severe neglect in the early 1900s, and indeed was covered with a dense natural forest, and bombing in 1944 destroyed the garden's Napoleonic-era orangerie. Since end of World War II, however, the garden has gradually been restored. Today's garden contains about 5,000 specimens representing 1200 taxa. Its site is roughly rectangular, about 2 hectares in extent, with the following major features: * Front garden - primarily trees, including Albizia julibrissin, Ginkgo biloba, Ilex aquifolium, Liriodendron tulipifera, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, as well as Musa basjoo, Phyllostachys viridis, and a fountain. * Rear garden - reconstruction of a typical local hardwood forest, with greenhouses, Orto dei Semplici, thematic collections (including those of alpine plants and carnivorous plants), and the forest. * Forest - Carex pendula, Corylus avellana, Equisetum telmateia, Hedera helix, Lonicera xylosteum, Populus alba, Salix purpurea, Sambucus nigra, etc. * Pond / wetlands * Tropical greenhouses - bromeliaceae and orchids, coffee, palm trees, spice and medicinal plants, and plants of economic interest * Succulent plant greenhouse - approximately 5000 succulent specimens from Central and South America, Africa, Madagascar, and the Canary Islands. * Carnivorous plant greenhouse - carnivorous plants from the genera Drosera, Pinguicula, and Utricularia. * Orto dei Semplici - a traditional herb garden, arranged by the plants' most common uses.

Historical background  The Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici was inaugurated with a public lecture by Eugenio Garin on 30 September 1989 in the presence of Federico Mayor Zaragoza, UNESCO General Director, and Fausta Morganti, San Marino Secretary of State for Public and Higher Education and Culture. Garin's lecture, entitled \\"Polibio e Machiavelli\\" (\\"Polybius and Machiavelli\\"), was subsequently edited by Gemma Cavalleri in July 1990 and published by the San Marino Ministry of State for Higher and Public Education and Culture.Cover with Aristotele, Perihermenias, Venetiis, 1526 edition, from the collections of the old library of the Convento di San Francesco di San Marino, the first San Marino education and cultural institution which dates back to 1468. The lecture text has since been republished by the Italian Turin-based publisher Einaudi, together with the introductory essay to the text of Istorie Fiorentine reprinted from the Le Monnier 1857 edition.  Organization  The Scuola is administratively responsible to the Department of Historical Studies within the University of the Republic of San Marino (Universit√† degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino), whose first enactment the Scuola's inauguration was. Its principal activity is a triennial doctoral programme which has represented from its inception in 1989 one of Europe's most innovative experiments in this field. The doctorate in historical studies (referred to in Italian as a Dottorato di ricerca, equivalent to a degree of Ph.D. or D.Phil. in the English-speaking world) is unusual in the level of interdisciplinary instruction offered to students. A distinguished Consiglio scientifico or academic council, recruited from Italy and beyond, is intended to ensure the strength and breadth of this interdisciplinarity, particularly in history and other humanities. Detail from the cover of the published version of Eugenio Garin's inaugural lecture edited by Gemma Cavalleri (1990)  Doctoral programme  Doctoral students attending the Scuola - some of whom are awarded full funding in the form of a borsa or scholarship on entry - have been drawn mainly from Italy and occasionally from San Marino itself; but a very substantial minority have come from other countries all over the world. During the first two years of each triennial cycle students attend intensive series of lectures delivered on historical and related academic disciplines delivered by a similarly international range of distinguished academics. At the same time they research and write their doctoral theses, which from the third year of the cycle becomes their sole academic focus. The Scuola recognises three official languages, Italian, English and French, and will accept theses written in any of the three. Students' doctoral supervisors are usually academics from other universities appointed as visiting staff for the purpose. The degree is awarded on the basis of the thesis and a viva voce examination. The first three triennial cycles ran from 1989 to 1995; after a hiatus the series resumed in 1999.  Directors  The Scuola has had two directors, both Italian ancient historians and public intellectuals: Aldo Schiavone (from 1989 to 1994) and Luciano Canfora (from 1999).  Faculty and professors  All the academics making up the Scientific Committee give lectures at the Scuola as well as invited external scholars. Among others, the Scuola has hosted, mostly on a regular basis, Giuseppe Alberigo, Etienne Balibar, Remo Bodei, , Jacques Le Goff, , , , , Umberto Eco, , Eric Hobsbawm, Michael Crawford, Michel Korinman, Charles S. Maier, Giacomo Marramao, , Anthony Molho, Wolfgang Mommsen, Romano Prodi, , , , , , Brigitte Mondrain, , Nicola Labanca, Pierre L√©v√™que, √âvelyne Patlagean, Chiara Frugoni, Eva Cantarella, Carlo Ginzburg, Ivano Dionigi, Carlo Ossola, Salvo Mastellone, , , Pietro Scoppola, , Enzo Collotti, , Domenico Losurdo, Ram√≥n Teja Casuso, Santiago Montero Herrero, Paolo Luigi Branca, Andr√© Vauchez, Tullio Gregory, , Giovanna Daverio Rocchi, , , Giuliana Gemelli, , , , , and Robert Nation.  Alumni  Among those who have studied and received their doctorates at the Scuola the following have attained eminence in their fields: Jan Krzysztof Olendzki, formerly (2006-7) Polish minister of culture and since 2008 Poland's ambassador to Tunisia; French historian of ideas and social commentator Marie Judith Revel; Italian historian of the French Revolution and of the myth of Padre Pio, Sergio Luzzatto; Michele Chiaruzzi, Ambassador of San Marino in Sarajevo; Nicola Renzi, former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of San Marino; Antonio Natalicchio, former mayor of Giovinazzo in Apulia, Italy; Roberto Gualtieri, Minister of Economy and Finances of Italy, and former Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.  Young Collection Exhibition at the Salone Internazionale del Libro 2010  In 2010 at the International Book Show (Salone Internazionale del Libro) in Turin, Italy, San Marino University Library exhibited the most precious volumes from the Young Collection, the richest collection of works on memory and mnemotechnics in the world. The Young Collection is conserved in the University library in San Marino. It includes 197 books from the nineteenth century as well as 11 incunabula, almost 2000 monographs of later date, 2000 articles, 500 prints, illustrations and artefacts, and other materials relating to memory and memorization.  Twentieth anniversary  On February 27, 2009, the twentieth anniversary from the Scuola foundation was celebrated in the presence of the Eccellentissimi Capitani Reggenti della Repubblica di San Marino (The Captains Regent). The celebration was presided over by Luciano Canfora and included three lectures by Maurice Aymard on 'I territori e i tempi della storia oggi', Giuseppe Galasso on 'Storicismo e identit√† europea' and Adriano Prosperi on 'L'et√† del disciplinamento: un bilancio'.  Positive assessment  On 5 July 2009, one of the most influential columnists on the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, historian, and former Italian ambassador to Moscow, Sergio Romano, wrote an article in praise of the University of San Marino and specifically describing the Scuola as \\"una eccellente scuola di alti studi frequentata da ottimi studiosi\\" (\\"an outstanding school of advanced studies attended by excellent scholars\\").Corriere della Sera, 5 July 2009. http://www.corriere.it/romano/09-07-05/01.spm  The \\"Artemidorus papyrus\\" controversy  In 1998 the influential pages of ‚ÄúArchiv f√ºr Papyrusforschung‚Äù brought a papyrus of obscure origin (\\"Artemidorus papyrus\\") to the attention of scholars.

Biography = Illicit gambling empire = Castor was born in 1926 to a family who was very involved in the jogo do bicho. His grandmother Iai√° was already known as a jogo do bicho lottery operator. His father, Eus√©bio de Andrade e Silva, invested in cattle raising and founded a transport company. Um Rei √† Bangu. Castor de Andrade do futebol do samba do jogo do bicho, Revista Placar, March 14, 1980 Castor had a carefree infancy.

This, however, did not prevent him from graduating in law. , Isto√©, April 16, 1997 Castor inherited the jogo do bicho office of his grandmother and father and with his uncles transformed it to an illicit gambling empire ‚Äì taking over more and more pontos (points-of-sale) where the lottery dealers collect money and keep record of the bets. He would eventually expand to slot machines and video poker as well. He rose to power despite his reputation. After the 1964 Brazilian coup d'√©tat, various generals paid homage to him. The military regime was unable to crack down on the illegal lottery.The Animal Game, Time Magazine, March 25, 1966 The Secretary of Security of Rio de Janeiro of that time, general Waldir Alves Muniz, received an instruction to \\"avoid problems with Castor de Andrade\\". Ex-president Jo√£o Figueiredo one day broke the protocol, departing from a group of authorities who surrounded him to personally greet the bicheiro.

Since the 1970s, most of the big samba schools had a \\"patron\\" related to the jogo do bicho. Castor de Andrade was the patron of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel samba school. Under his leadership Mocidade won the Rio Carnival title in 1979, 1985, 1990, 1991, and 1996. His participation in the Carnival was not limited to his samba school. For decades he invested money in the organization of parades. Dissatisfied with where the official league, the Associa√ß√£o das Escolas de Samba da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro (AESCRJ), was heading for and feeling a need to negotiate more openly with the government about financial transfers to the Carnival, Castor helped found the Liga Independente das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro (LIESA - Samba Schools' Independente League of Rio de Janeiro) in Rio de Janeiro in 1984. He served as LIESA's first president. Because of the new league, the samba schools started receiving more financial assistance and the standard of the parades could be maintained.

Castor de Andrade was one of the first bicheiros that started bribing policemen, and policemen from all police forces received money from him. A special screened unit of the BOPE (Special Police Operations Battalion), the special forces of the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State, was used during the operation against Castor.Frossard (2007), p. 189. The police investigations revealed that big names had been profiting from the illegal activities of bicho's Mafia. Among them, former president Fernando Collor de Mello, Rio governor Nilo Batista, S√£o Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf, Rio mayor Cesar Maia, seven entrepreneurs, three judges, 12 congressmen and seven assemblymen, 25 police commissioners and 100 police officers.Mafia: Never ending mud, News from Brazil, May 31, 1994 According to prosecutor Ant√¥nio Carlos Biscaia, \\"the Public Ministry of Rio de Janeiro investigated their involvement in more than 130 homicides and verified the corruption scheme centralized and led by Castor de Andrade [...], who recorded the bribes for military and civil policemen, public servants, including those of the Public Ministry and Judiciary, and even well-known politicians who received financial help for their compromised political campaigns.\\" Biscaia, Ant√¥nio Carlos. \\"A volta dos bicheiros\\", O Globo, March 22, 1998 There were also suspicions that Castor and his people had a partnership with Colombian Cali Cartel. Preliminary findings showed Rio bicheiros responsible for transporting cocaine in Brazil and shipping it overseas. In Porto Seguro, Castor had set up a fishing company that was used for cocaine trafficking. He allegedly helped the Sicilian Mafioso Antonio Salamone to settle in Brazil. Castor gave him a cover job at Bangu Textiles, which he owned. Salamone became a naturalized Brazilian because of de Andrade's influence. Maierovitch, W√°lter Fanganiello. Conex√£o Parque Laje .

Following charges that their cells were filled with luxuries, authorities decided to inspect their cells. The inspectors concluded that the jail looked like \\"a five-star hotel\\". The cells were equipped with a mini-bar, a TV, a video player, a sound system with a CD player, cellphones, an air-conditioner, a microwave oven, and a freezer.

Retrieved on 17 January 2012. Defries managed to fly at height of about 15 ft (5 m) at a speed of about 36 mph. He then lost control and crashed, that led to the opinion that no controlled flight was achieved. With the Aerial League and a newspaper denying that the flight had occurred at all, Defries made a second attempt on 18 December. Finally, his mechanic, R. C. Banks, made an attempt of his own on 1 March 1910, and crashed the plane again. Wing Commander Harry Cobby wrote in Aircraft in March 1938 that \\"the first aeroplane flight in the Southern Hemisphere was made in 1909 by Mr Colin Defries, a Londoner, at Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney, in a Wilbur Wright aeroplane\\". Colin Defries was a trained pilot, having learnt to fly in Cannes, France. By modern standards his flight time was minimal, but in 1909 he had enough experience to become an instructor. He took it off, maintained straight and level flight, albeit briefly, and landed safely, on his first flight. His crash landing on his second flight demonstrated what a momentary lack of attention could cause while flying a Wright Model A.

After a concert tour in Germany, he went to Paris and studied under Jean-Delphin Alard. In 1850 he crossed the Channel, and in London his remarkable talents as a violinist were recognized after a short time. He became leader at Her Majesty's Theatre under Sir Michael Costa and also led the new Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Choral Society. Pollitzer was a preeminent in his day as an interpreter of classic chamber- music, his playing attaining to what may be called \\"the great style\\". As a teacher of his instrument, he was regarded as the most eminent of his time in England and many pupils who attained distinction had studied under him. In 1861, on the establishment of the London Academy of Music, he was appointed professor of violin. He held this position until 1870, when he succeeded Dr. Henry Wylde as principal of the Academy and retained this position until his death, which occurred in London.

It occurred on 19 July 1960 over Brisbane in a Trans Australia Airlines Lockheed Electra. Forty three passengers and six crew were on board Flight 408, the last Sydney to Brisbane flight for the day. The crew consisted of Hostesses Fay Strugnell and Janeene Christie, Captain John Benton, First Officer Tom R. Bennett, Flight Engineer Fred McDonald, and T.A.A. captain, D.R.Lawrence (traveling as a passenger). The hijacker, Russian Alex Hildebrandt, had a fully loaded sawn-off .22 calibre rifle and had suspended over a torch battery a bare wire attached to a detonator adjoining two sticks of gelignite. Another wire was attached from the gelignite to the battery. After demanding that the plane be redirected to Singapore, Hildebrandt fired a shot, which went through the aircraft ceiling, narrowly missing Bennett who punched Hildebrandt and pulled the wires from his hand and disabled the bomb. Captain Dennis Lawrence, an employee of TAA who was travelling as a passenger, assisted Bennett to subdue and disarm the hijacker. Tom Bennett was awarded the George Medal for his actions and Captain Lawrence was commended.The Sunday Mail (Brisbane), 23 July 1995, Pages 57&87Contested Skies, John Gunn, , Page 171&172\\"BENNETT, Thomas Ross\\".

Hildebrandt, who was born in the Soviet Union in 1938, faced serious charges of attempted murder, having an explosive detonating device with the intention of destroying the aircraft and having explosives capable of causing injuries to persons on board. Hildebrandt was sentenced to three years in jail for attempted murder, ten years for attempting to destroy the aircraft and two years for the explosives charge. He successfully appealed the sentence in the Queensland Criminal Court as he argued that the aircraft which was thirty five minutes into the flight, was over New South Wales when he armed the explosives in the aircraft toilet. He served a three-year sentence in Brisbane, for attempted murder and on discharge was arrested by detectives from New South Wales. He faced court again and was convicted on the charge of attempted destruction of an aircraft and sentenced to seven in prison in New South Wales.

He was also a long jumper who represented Britain at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam where he finished 32nd in the long jump event. At the first British Empire Games, in 1930, he won the silver medal in both the long jump and triple jump competition. Early life He was born at Portsmouth, where his father was a marine surveyor. As a boy he saw his father receive a visit from seaman's representatives after the wreck of the RMS Titanic. He recollected attending the memorial service for Florence Nightingale with his mother in 1910. In the late 1920s he was a doctoral student in astrophysics at the University of Cambridge. A Commonwealth Scholarship in 1930 took him to study astrophysics and astronomy at the University of Michigan, and on his return to Cambridge as a fellow to Emmanuel he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford and Sir J. J. Thomson. There were five Nobel prizewinners in the department, but Revans found them humble enough to share their puzzlements and to listen, rather than claiming to know and be able to instruct. Revans always remembered Albert Einstein saying to him: \\"If you think you understand a problem, make sure you are not deceiving yourself.\\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article884986.ece Times obituary It was here that Revans began to develop his thinking on the role of 'non-expert' in problem solving, distinguishing between knowledge and wisdom in so doing. He moved into education to become assistant education officer for Essex (1935‚Äì1945) and then director of education for the National Coal Board from 1945 to 1950. Action Learning It was at the Coal Board that Revans did much of the early work on developing action learning, working alongside E. F. Schumacher (author of Small is Beautiful) and Eric Trist, whose theories about socio-technical systems have also had an important influence on organisation development. He then moved to the Acton Society Trust where he worked with Teddy Chester. He and Chester both moved to the University of Manchester where Revans became the first professor of industrial management (1955‚Äì1965) but left to develop the inter-university action learning programme in Belgium. Revans strongly held that the key to improving performance lay not with 'experts' but with practitioners themselves. Hence he devised Action Learning as a process whereby the participant studies his own actions and experience in conjunction with others in small groups called action learning sets.  Belgium  After resigning from Manchester University, Revans moved to Belgium where he headed the Inter-University project, which had been set up to improve the ranking of Belgium in the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development league. Working with five universities and 23 of the country's largest businesses, Revans' collaborative approaches succeeded in raising Belgium's industrial productivity growth rate above that of the US, Germany and Japan. Revans was subsequently awarded with the nation's top honour by the King of Belgium. In 1969, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath.http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/older.html Later life During the 1970s and 1980s he travelled round the world several times and wrote his most famous books: Developing Effective Managers (1971); The Origins and Growth of Action Learning (1982) and ABC of Action Learning (1983). From the 1980s Revans worked with public and private sector organisations, in the UK and internationally, advocating the process of action learning as a way of enabling and empowering people to learn with and from each other. In the 1990s he was associated with the City of London where he met Raymond Mahoney and Alan Wenham-Prosser who were using his techniques to solve peoples problems of managing their work load in the City, and other personal problems which had become long term when managing difficult situations. Reg Revans was made a Freeman of the City of London for the work which he did. Revans made furniture as a hobby, played the trumpet and painted ‚Äî even illustrating small books for his children. As well as being knighted by the King of Belgium, in 1997 he was awarded the freedom of the City of London. Revans died in Wem, Shropshire on 8 January 2003. Legacy Revans is not remembered as one of the best known gurus of management education or organisational development, not least because of his scorn for experts and his championing of ordinary people. However, his ideas have been taught at the Revans Centre for Action Learning and Research (later the Revans Institute), part of the Salford Business School and they are applied in many organisations.

It lies on the right bank of the Soƒça (Isonzo) river, north and west of the Italian town of Gorizia, after which it is named. The region has around 120 square kilometres and 7,000 inhabitants, mostly ethnic Slovenes, with a small number of Friulian speakers in its westernmost part (in the municipality of Dolegna del Collio). Today, the majority of the region is in Slovenia, with around 60% of the territory and 80% of the inhabitants. The Slovene part of the Gorizia Hills lies entirely in the Municipality of Brda. The Italian part lies within the boundaries of the Province of Gorizia, and it's divided among the municipalities of San Floriano del Collio, Cormons and Dolegna del Collio. The region is predominately a white wine producer with Friulano, Ribolla Gialla, Malvasia Istriana, Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio and Sauvignon blanc being the leading varietals. Red wine is produced under the Collio Rosso designation and is usually a blend of Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.M. Ewing- Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 132-140 Hungry Minds 2001 In Italy, the Gorizia Hills are designated Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) and belong to the Italian wine region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The DOC is located in the province of Gorizia near the border with Slovenia. Some Slovene wine from the region of Brda also carry the designation of Collio due to their vineyards overlapping across the Italian border. History The history of the Gorizia Hills has been largely influenced by its close Slavic and Austro-Hungarian ties, and it was annexed to Italy only after the First World War. After Second World War, the majority of the region became part of Yugoslavia, and only a small strip of territory between the villages of San Floriano del Collio and Dolegna del Collio remained in Italy. The boundaries of the traditional wine region thus extended further eastward into what is now Slovenia. Even today, some Italian winemakers still produce Slovene wines under the Collio designation from vineyards in the Gori≈°ka brda region across the border. In the 1970s, the Collio Goriziano was one of the Italy's leading white wine producers and was pioneer in producing fresher, more vibrant white wines using winemaking methodology that focused on minimizing skin contact and oxidation.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 187 Oxford University Press 2006 Geography The name Collio is taken from the Italian word Colli, which means 'hillsides' and describes the terrain of the Collio Goriziano region. The Slovene name Brda has the same meaning. The Gorizia Hills extend from the Judrio river in the west where it borders the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC to the Slovene border on the east. The region continues into Slovenia, where it is entirely included in the Municipality of Brda, which extends from the Italian border to the Soƒça (Isonzo) River. To the south is the Isonzo del Friuli DOC, also in the Gorizia province. Most of the region's vineyards are centered on the comune of Cormons. The soil of the region is composed of calcareous marl and flysch sandstone. Viticulture and winemaking The Collio Goriziano is the fourth- largest DOC in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia in terms of areas planted. It is also the 4th leading producer in terms of volume, trailing the Friuli Grave, Isonzo and Colli Orientali del Friuli region in production. Over 85% of the Collio production is in white wine grape varieties. While still low in comparison to the rest of Italy, the yields in the Collio Goriziano are higher than the 3.5 tons an acre average of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia. In the Collio, the yields average around 4.4 tons/acre (77 hectolitres/hectare) though some quality conscious producers have lower yields. Winemaker Mario Schiopetto was one of the first to incorporate German winemaking techniques like cold fermentation to white wine production in the Collio Goriziano. Today, winemaking on the region is very technologically advance with refrigerated fermentation tanks, pneumatic wine presses, and centrifugation bottling systems. The objective of most Gorizia Hills winemakers is to maximize the fresh fruit and pure varietal characteristic of the grape. To that extent, oak influence is not widely used in this region though some winemaking are experimenting with its use and different blends of grape varieties to produce more complex wine.

His music reflects a fascination with transitory physical aspects of sound, such as resonance and decay. Tharp was born in Indiana, and studied music composition and history at Oberlin College before entering the graduate program in composition at the University of California, Berkeley. As a recipient of the university's Ladd Fellowship, he spent two years in Paris studying composition with Philippe Leroux and orchestration with Marc-Andr√© Dalbavie. He was selected for the Stage d‚ÄôAutomne at IRCAM in 2000 and has participated in workshops and seminars with Ivan Fedele, Brian Ferneyhough and Jonathan Harvey. In recent years, his music has been performed in the U.S. and Europe by groups such as the Berkeley Contemporary Chamber Players, the Orchestre Lyrique de Region Avignon-Provence and the Nieuw Ensemble (Amsterdam), which commissioned and premiered his work A Backward Glance in 2000. Several of these performances have been broadcast on French and Dutch radio. Awards for his music include BMI‚Äôs William Schuman Prize, Columbia University‚Äôs Joseph H. Bearns Prize for his orchestral work Drift and UC Berkeley‚Äôs Nicola DeLorenzo Prize. Recent projects include commissions from the Irving M. Klein International String Competition, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players for their 2008-2009 season and a duo for flute and harp for Jonathan Keeble and Ann Yeung. Tharp has taught composition, orchestration, analysis and theory at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, UC Berkeley, Northwestern University and San Francisco State University.

Background Christmas Lutheran Church in BethlehemMitri Raheb was born in Bethlehem, in 1962. He pursued his higher education in Germany, first at Hermannsburg Mission Seminary (1980‚Äì1984) and then at Philipps University in Marburg, Germany (1984‚Äì1988), where he completed his graduate studies including a doctorate in theology. He returned to Bethlehem in 1988 to serve as the pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church (Christmas Lutheran Church), and serving as the managing editor of the Al-Liqa‚Äô Journal for religious and heritage studies in the Holy Land (1992‚Äì1996). Since 1992, Raheb has founded and led a number of projects and institutions serving the social needs of Palestinians living in the Bethlehem area, focusing specifically on women, children, youth, and the elderly. He is one of the co-authors of Kairos Palestine document together with Patriarch Michel Sabah, Rev. Naim Ateek, Rifat Kassis and others. Israeli diplomats have criticized Raheb's work on the document, claiming that it is \\"an extremist and racist document which does not contribute to reconciliation and peace between the Palestinians and Israelis.\\" Raheb has been critical of Western support for Christians of the region and their lack of support against the Israeli occupation: ‚ÄúThere is talk as if the West is genuinely interested in Christians, but most of the time they only use them for their own political ends.\\" In 2010, at the \\"Christ at the Checkpoint\\" conference in Bethlehem, Raheb stated that \\"Israel represents Rome of the Bible, not the people of the land. ... I'm sure if we do a DNA test between David, who was a Bethlemite, and Jesus, born in Bethlehem, and Mitri, born just across the street from where Jesus was born, I'm sure the DNA will show that there is a trace. While, if you put King David, Jesus and Netanyahu, you will get nothing, because Netanyahu comes from an East European tribe who converted to Judaism in the Middle Ages.\\" Tricia Miller denounced this as a \\"racial theory to support his belief that Jews are not the true people of the Land of Israel,\\" adding that \\"the idea that Jews of European descent are not really Jewish is an old anti-Semitic fabrication used to delegitimize the connection between modern Jews, their Israelite ancestors, and their historic ties to the Land of Israel.\\" He currently lives in Bethlehem with his wife and two daughters. =The Diyar Consortium= The Diyar Consortium is an umbrella organization that is responsible for the administration of its component institutions: the ICB, the Dar Al-Kalima Health & Wellness Center, and the Dar Al-Kalima College. ‚ÄúDiyar‚Äù () is the plural of ‚Äúdar‚Äù (), meaning ‚Äúhouse‚Äù or ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù in Arabic. It is headed by its president, Raheb, who is responsible for the overall vision of the consortium and securing funds for continuous growth. The consortium is governed by a Board of Directors, whose members come from diverse religious and vocational backgrounds, and administered by an executive committee and three program committees (for health, culture, and education). =The International Center of Bethlehem (Dar Annadwa Addawliyya)= The International Center of Bethlehem, or Dar Annadwa Addawliyya (), meaning ‚ÄúThe House of Worldwide Encounter‚Äù) is located in Madbasseh Square, in central Bethlehem, about half a mile (.8 km) from Manger Square. A number of initiatives operate under the aegis of the ICB. These include: * The Ad-Dar Cultural and Conference Center * The Al-Kahf Gallery and Arts & Crafts Center (independently, and in cooperation with the Dar Al-Kalima College) * The Bethlehem Media Center (independently, and in conjunction with the Dar Al-Kalima College) * The Bright Stars Program (in cooperation with the Dar Al-Kalima Model School) * The Abu Gubran Guest House and the Authentic Tourism Program * The Il‚ÄôIliyeh Restaurant and Al-Kuz Bar & Caf√© * The Ajyal (‚ÄúGenerations‚Äù, Arabic: ÿ£ÿ¨ŸäÿßŸÑ) community care program for the elderly * The Azwaj (‚ÄúCouples‚Äù, Arabic: ÿ£ÿ≤Ÿàÿßÿ¨) group for young couples and families * The ‚ÄúPalestinian Christians: Strengthening Identity, Activating Potential‚Äù Project (headed by Rifat Odeh Kassis) The ICB complex comprises the old Lutheran School building, the former church offices, and three other buildings. The Ad- Dar Cultural and Conference Center and other modern parts of the building were designed by Finnish architect Juha Leivisk√§. The ICB complex sustained significant damage when it was occupied for 3 days by the Israeli army during the siege of Bethlehem in April 2002. Reconstruction and restoration costs totaled more than US$500,000. =The Dar Al-Kalima Model School= The Dar Al- Kalima Model School (), meaning ‚ÄúThe House of the Word‚Äù) is located on the hilltop Mt. Murair campus and serves students in grades K-12. The school is coeducational and Lutheran-based, serving both Christian and Muslim students from the towns, villages, and refugee camps of the Bethlehem area. The Extra- Curricular Program after school offers students the opportunity to receive instruction in their specific, chosen areas of interest from professionals in those fields. The Bright Stars program (run through the ICB) is similar to the ECP program, but it meets once a week and is open to children who attend schools other than Dar Al-Kalima. The Dar al-Kalima Complex =The Dar Al- Kalima Health & Wellness Center= The Health & Wellness Center is also located on the hilltop Mt. Murair campus, on the ground level of the building that houses the Dar Al-Kalima Model School. It houses health clinics (audiology, nutrition, endocrinology, cardiology, and psychotherapy) as well as fitness facilities and programming, including a swimming pool and sauna, yoga and aerobics classes, and exercise machines. The aims of the Health & Wellness Center are prevention through promotion of healthy lifestyles, and providing specialist care not available elsewhere in the southern West Bank. =The Dar Al-Kalima College= The College began operating in 2006 from the ICB complex in Madbasseh Square, offering diploma courses in documentary film- making and glass and ceramic art. The College received accreditation in 2007 from the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education for Bachelor‚Äôs degree programs in contemporary fine art, multimedia and tourism studies.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated, ‚ÄúIt is an outrage that the organizers of the German Media Prize would bestow their highest honor on a religious bigot who is re-introducing Replacement Theology to de-legitimize the Jewish people and its right to pursue its spiritual and national destiny.‚Äù B‚Äônai Brith International stated, ‚ÄúDr. Raheb is distinguished by an extensive record of highly offensive statements that, any positive work notwithstanding, make him ill-suited to receive the endorsement implied by a prestigious German honor ‚Ä¶ Experts have seen in Dr. Raheb‚Äôs views an echo of the widely eschewed replacement theology maintaining that Christians have superseded Jews in the Divine plan and have inherited God‚Äôs promises to Jews.‚Äù Deidre Berger, head of the Berlin office of the American Jewish Committee, said, ‚ÄúIt is outrageous to consider Raheb a partner for peace as long as he engages in anti-Israel invective,‚Äù Raheb's work has been recognized by the Luther Institute in Washington, DC (Wittenberg Award, 2003), Concordia University in River Forest, IL, USA (Honorary Doctor of Letters, 2003), Spirituality and Health Magazine (50 Best Spiritual Books of 2004 for Bethlehem Besieged: Stories of Home in Times of Trouble), and the Central Islamic Archive Institute (Mohammed Nafi Tschleibi International Peace Award, 2006). In 2008, he was awarded the Aachen Peace Award. Press Raheb‚Äôs work has attracted attention from major media networks, including the BBC, ABC, and HBO, and has been featured in publications such as the Washington Post, the Economist, Newsweek, the New York Times and the Boston Globe. He has also been interviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, CNN and CBS.

Although it is categorised as an armoured unit, the battalion (strictly a battlegroup) primarily serves in the mechanised infantry role. As with the Telemark Bataljon it also has a tank squadron equipped with the Leopard 2 main battle tank. It was formed in 1987 and has participated in several international operations in the Balkans (KFOR) and in Afghanistan (ISAF). The battalion is recognised as a cavalry unit for ceremonial purposes, so its enlisted soldiers are referred to as dragoons as opposed to privates, as is the case in most of the Norwegian Army. Organization *Kavalerieskadronen ‚Äì The first squadron, known as ESK1, KavEsk or Kavalerieskadronen (The Cavalry Squadron) is a reconnaissance unit. Its roles also include artillery observation and sharpshooters. It also uses the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle. The unit colour is blue. The Armoured Reconnaissance platoon in ESK1 has the motto \\"Primus Intrat, Exit Novissimus\\" meaning \\"First in, last out\\". *Stridsvogneskadronen ‚Äì The second squadron, known as ESK2, Strv esk 2 or Stridsvogneskadronen (The Armoured Squadron) is the battalion's main strike weapon. The squadron operates with the Leopard 2 main battle tank. The unit colour is red. *Stormeskadron 3 ‚Äì The third squadron, known as ESK3 or Stormeskadron 3 (Assault Squadron 3). The squadron's role is to support ESK2 with mechanised infantry support. The squadron is based on quick and aggressive assaults with infantry squads supported by their CV90 infantry fighting vehicles. The unit colour is yellow. The Motto of the squadron is \\"Semper Paratus\\", which means always ready. *Stormeskadron 4 ‚Äì The fourth squadron, known as ESK4 or Stormeskadron 4 (Assault Squadron 4). The squadron has the same role as that of ESK3. The unit colour is green, and their motto \\" Gulo ad arma, Plus Ultra\\" meaning \\"Wolverines to battle, continue forward\\" is in reference to their ability to push forward in combat. *Kampst√∏tteeskadronen ‚Äì The fifth squadron, known as ESK6 or Kampst√∏tte Eskadron 6 (Combat Support Squadron 6). The largest and most complex of the battalion's units, its capabilities include logistics support, repair and recovery, signals, medevac and mortar support. The unit is also responsible for the protection and operation of the battalion's base of operations. The unit colour is black. The squadron motto is \\"Volens et Potens\\" which means willing and able. *Minkebataljonen ‚Äì During operations the battalion is usually supported by elements of the Combat Service support battalion, Engineer battalion, Intelligence battalion, Artillery battalion and Medical Battalion as well as Military police and other elements that may be attached depending on the mission. This combat group is known as Minkebataljonen. ESK5 is no longer operational. Its role as supporting the battalion's base of operations was transferred to ESK6. The motto of the battalion is Bitit fyrst (Old Norse for \\"Strike First\\"), referring to the offensive role of the battalion.

Approach In August 1945, Konstantin Volkov, Vice Consul for the Soviet Union in Istanbul, sent a letter to Chantry Hamilton Page, the vice consul in the British embassy, requesting an urgent appointment. Page decided the letter was a \\"prank\\" and ignored it. A few days later, on 4 September, Volkov, accompanied by his wife Zoya, arrived in person and asked for a meeting with Page. Page did not speak Russian, and so he brought in John Leigh Reed, first secretary at the embassy, to translate what Volkov had to say. Reed later reported: \\"I was serving in our embassy in Turkey in 1945.... One morning this Russian walks into reception looking very nervous and asks to see the acting consul-general, Chantry Page. The Russian is Konstantin Volkov, Page's opposite number in the Soviet embassy. I'd done my Russian exams so I get the job as interpreter. Anyway, it turns out that Volkov is really an NKVD officer and he has decided to defect. He says he wants a laissez-passer for himself and his wife to Cyprus and ¬£27,500. In return he is offering the real names of three Soviet agents working in Britain. He says two of them are working in the Foreign Office, one the head of a counter-espionage organization in London.\\"John Leigh Reed, interviewed by Phillip Knightley (July, 1988) He asked for ¬£27,500 and a promise of political asylum, stating that if his demands were met he was willing to expose 314 Soviet agents in Turkey and 250 Soviet agents in Britain. More importantly, he said there were two British diplomats (later revealed to be Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean) in the Foreign Office and another man (later revealed to be Kim Philby) in a very high ranking position in the Counter Intelligence Section of the British Secret Intelligence Service who were spying for the Soviet Union. He demanded an answer within three weeks, and insisted that Istanbul not send his information by cable because the Soviets were reading British Cipher System traffic. The news was sent to Sir Stewart Menzies, head of the SIS (commonly known to the media and the public as MI-6) by a diplomatic courier. In London, the matter was given to the head of the Russian Section, Kim Philby, who was one of the three Soviet agents that Volkov had threatened to name. Philby recognized this situation, informed his Soviet handlers, and intentionally took a long delay before flying to Istanbul, allowing Soviet agents to reach Volkov first. Arrest Meanwhile, Volkov returned to the Soviet Consulate, from where he quickly disappeared. He was last seen as a heavily bandaged figure being hustled aboard a Soviet transport plane bound for Moscow. Aftermath Philby arrived 21 days late; he defended himself by suggesting that his delay was caused by the slow pace of couriers. The Consulate officials who had met with Volkov were enraged by Philby's delayed arrival, believing his actions criminally incompetent. However, it was soon discovered that the British phone lines between Istanbul and Ankara had been tapped by Soviet intelligence, and that the Volkov matter was discussed during this period. This provided a cover for Philby; it was only six years later that he was eventually dismissed from his intelligence roles due to a series of other suspicious incidents by 1951. Philby's identity as a Soviet agent was finally confirmed in 1963, when he defected to the Soviet Union.

The following is a list of software bugs with significant consequences.  Space  * A booster went off course during launch, resulting in the destruction of NASA Mariner 1. This was the result of the failure of a transcriber to notice an overbar in a written specification for the guidance program, resulting in the coding of an incorrect formula in its FORTRAN software. (July 22, 1962). The initial reporting of the cause of this bug was incorrect. in , reprinted in . See and * NASA's 1965 Gemini 5 mission landed short of its intended splashdown point due to an incorrect constant for the Earth's rotation rate. The rotation rate corresponding to the 24 hour solar day was used instead of the rotation rate relative to the fixed stars. The shorter length of the first three missions and a computer failure on Gemini 4 prevented the bug from being detected earlier. * The Russian Space Research Institute's Phobos 1 (Phobos program) deactivated its attitude thrusters and could no longer properly orient its solar arrays or communicate with Earth, eventually depleting its batteries. (September 10, 1988). * The European Space Agency's Ariane 5 Flight 501 was destroyed 40 seconds after takeoff (June 4, 1996). The US$1 billion prototype rocket self-destructed due to a bug in the on-board guidance software. * In 1997, the Mars Pathfinder mission was jeopardised by a bug in concurrent software shortly after the rover landed, which was found in preflight testing but given a low priority as it only occurred in certain unanticipated heavy-load conditions. The problem, which was identified and corrected from Earth, was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion. * In 2000, a Zenit 3SL launch failed due to faulty ground software not closing a valve in the rocket's second stage pneumatic system. * The European Space Agency's CryoSat-1 satellite was lost in a launch failure in 2005 due to a missing shutdown command in the flight control system of its Rokot carrier rocket. * NASA Mars Polar Lander was destroyed because its flight software mistook vibrations caused by the deployment of the stowed legs for evidence that the vehicle had landed and shut off the engines 40 meters from the Martian surface (December 3, 1999). * Its sister spacecraft Mars Climate Orbiter was also destroyed, due to software on the ground generating commands based on parameters in pound-force (lbf) rather than newtons (N). * A mis-sent command from Earth caused the software of the NASA Mars Global Surveyor to incorrectly assume that a motor had failed, causing it to point one of its batteries at the sun. This caused the battery to overheat (November 2, 2006). * NASA's Spirit rover became unresponsive on January 21, 2004, a few weeks after landing on Mars. Engineers found that too many files had accumulated in the rover's flash memory. It was restored to working condition after deleting unnecessary files. * Japan's Hitomi astronomical satellite was destroyed on March 26, 2016, when a thruster fired in the wrong direction, causing the spacecraft to spin faster instead of stabilize. * Israel's first attempt to land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon with the Beresheet was rendered unsuccessful on April 11, 2019 due to a software bug with its engine system, which prevented it from slowing down during its final descent on the moon's surface. Engineers attempted to correct this bug by remotely rebooting the engine, but by time they regained control of it, Beresheet could not slow down in time to avert a hard, crash landing that disintegrated it.  Medical  * A bug in the code controlling the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine was directly responsible for at least five patient deaths in the 1980s when it administered excessive quantities of beta radiation. * Radiation therapy planning software RTP/2 created by Multidata Systems International could incorrectly double the dosage of radiation depending on how the technician entered data into the machine. At least eight patients died, while another 20 received overdoses likely to cause significant health problems (November 2000). See also Instituto_Oncol√≥gico_Nacional#Accident * A Medtronic heart device was found vulnerable to remote attacks (2008-03). * The Becton Dickinson Alaris Gateway Workstation allows unauthorized arbitrary remote execution (2019). * The CareFusion Alaris pump module (8100) will not properly delay an Infusion when the \\"Delay Until\\" option or \\"Multidose\\" feature is used (2015).  Tracking years  * The year 2000 problem spawned fears of worldwide economic collapse and an industry of consultants providing last- minute fixes. * A similar problem will occur in 2038 (the year 2038 problem), as many Unix-like systems calculate the time in seconds since 1 January 1970, and store this number as a 32-bit signed integer, for which the maximum possible value is (2,147,483,647) seconds. * An error in the payment terminal code for Bank of Queensland rendered many devices inoperable for up to a week. The problem was determined to be an incorrect hexadecimal number conversion routine. When the device was to tick over to 2010, it skipped six years to 2016, causing terminals to decline customers' cards as expired.  Electric power transmission  * The Northeast blackout of 2003 was triggered by a local outage that went undetected due to a race condition in General Electric Energy's XA/21 monitoring software.  Administration  * The software of the A2LL system for handling unemployment and social services in Germany presented several errors with large-scale consequences, such as sending the payments to invalid account numbers in 2004.  Telecommunications  * AT&T; long- distance network crash (January 15, 1990), in which the failure of one switching system would cause a message to be sent to nearby switching units to tell them that there was a problem. Unfortunately, the arrival of that message would cause those other systems to fail too ‚Äì resulting in a cascading failure that rapidly spread across the entire AT&T; long-distance network. * In January 2009, Google's search engine erroneously notified users that every web site worldwide was potentially malicious, including its own. * In May 2015, iPhone users discovered a bug where sending a certain sequence of characters and Unicode symbols as a text to another iPhone user would crash the receiving iPhone's SpringBoard interface, and may also crash the entire phone, induce a factory reset, or disrupt the device's connectivity to a significant degree, preventing it from functioning normally. The bug persisted for weeks, gained substantial notoriety and saw a number of individuals using the bug to play pranks on other iOS users, before Apple eventually patched it on June 30, 2015 with iOS 8.4.  Military  * The software error of a MIM-104 Patriot caused its system clock to drift by one third of a second over a period of one hundred hours ‚Äì resulting in failure to locate and intercept an incoming Iraqi Al Hussein missile, which then struck Dharan barracks, Saudi Arabia (February 25, 1991), killing 28 Americans. * A Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre in June of 1994, killing 29. Initially, the crash was dismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by Computer Weekly uncovered sufficient evidence to convince a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been caused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine control computer. * Smart ship USS Yorktown was left dead in the water in 1997 for nearly 3 hours after a divide by zero error. * In April 1992 the first F-22 Raptor crashed while landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The cause of the crash was found to be a flight control software error that failed to prevent a pilot-induced oscillation. * While attempting its first overseas deployment to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, on 11 February 2007, a group of six F-22 Raptors flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple computer crashes coincident with their crossing of the 180th meridian of longitude (the International Date Line). The computer failures included at least navigation (completely lost) and communication. The fighters were able to return to Hawaii by following their tankers, something that might have been problematic had the weather not been good. The error was fixed within 48 hours, allowing a delayed deployment.  Media  * In the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal (October 2005), Sony BMG produced a Van Zant music CD that employed a copy protection scheme that covertly installed a rootkit on any Windows PC that was used to play it. Their intent was to hide the copy protection mechanism to make it harder to circumvent. Unfortunately, the rootkit inadvertently opened a security hole resulting in a wave of successful trojan horse attacks on the computers of those who had innocently played the CD. Sony's subsequent efforts to provide a utility to fix the problem actually exacerbated it.  Video gaming  * Eve Onlines deployment of the Trinity patch erased the boot.ini file from several thousand users' computers, rendering them unable to boot. This was due to the usage of a legacy system within the game that was also named boot.ini. As such, the deletion had targeted the wrong directory instead of the /eve directory. * The Corrupted Blood incident was a software bug in World of Warcraft that caused a deadly, debuff-inducing virtual disease that could only be contracted during a particular raid to be set free into the rest of the game world, leading to numerous, repeated deaths of many player characters. This caused players to avoid crowded places in-game, just like in a \\"real world\\" epidemic, and the bug became the center of some academic research on the spread of infectious diseases. * On June 6, 2006, the online game RuneScape suffered from a bug that enabled certain player characters to kill and loot other characters, who were unable to fight back against the affected characters because the game still thought they were in player-versus-player mode even after they were kicked out of a combat ring from the house of a player who was suffering from lag while celebrating an in-game accomplishment. Players who were killed by the glitched characters lost many items, and the bug was so devastating that the players who were abusing it were soon tracked down, caught and banned permanently from the game, but not before they had laid waste to the region of Falador, thus christening the bug \\"Falador Massacre\\". * In the 256th level of Pac-Man, a bug results in a kill screen. The maximum number of fruit available is seven and when that number rolls over, it causes the entire right side of the screen to become a jumbled mess of symbols while the left side remains normal. * Upon initial release, the ZX Spectrum game Jet Set Willy was impossible to complete because of a severe bug that corrupted the game data, causing enemies and the player character to be killed in certain rooms of the large mansion where the entire game takes place. The bug, known as \\"The Attic Bug\\", would occur when the player entered the mansion's attic, which would then cause an arrow to travel offscreen, out of the Spectrum's memory and into the game's memory, altering crucial variables and behavior in an undesirable way. The game's developers initially excused this bug by claiming that the affected rooms were death traps, but ultimately owned up to it and issued instructions to players on how to fix the game itself. * The first game in the Civilization series contained a notorious bug that caused one of the world leaders, Mahatma Gandhi, to behave like an aggressive warmonger, despite being known for advocating peace in the real world. The bug, which became famously known as \\"Nuclear Gandhi\\", became possible when Gandhi's aggression rating, represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer, was set to the lowest positive value of 1. If the player chose to democratize his native India, the rating would decrease by two, causing it to roll over back to the highest value, 255, thus making him the most aggressive leader in the game. The bug was so famous that the developers decided to allow players to deliberately goad Gandhi into aggressive conflict in later sequels. * One of the free demo discs issued to PlayStation Underground subscribers in the United States contained a serious bug, particularly in the demo for Viewtiful Joe 2, that would not only crash the PlayStation 2, but would also unformat any memory cards that were plugged into that console, erasing any and all saved data onto them. The bug was so severe that Sony had to apologize for it and send out free copies of other PS2 games to affected players as consolation. * Due to a severe programming error, much of the Nintendo DS game Bubble Bobble Revolution is unplayable because a mandatory boss fight failed to trigger in the 30th level. * An update for the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero II, which was intended to fix some issues with the whammy bar on that game's guitar controllers, came with a bug that caused some consoles to freeze, or even stop working altogether, producing the infamous \\"red ring of death\\". * Valve's Steam client for Linux could accidentally delete all the user's files in every directory on the computer. This happened to users that had moved Steam's installation directory. The bug is the result of unsafe shellscript programming: : STEAMROOT=\\"$(cd \\"\${0%/*}\\" && echo $PWD)\\" # Scary! rm -rf \\"$STEAMROOT/\\"* :The first line tries to find the script's containing directory. This could fail, for example if the directory was moved while the script was running, invalidating the \\"selfpath\\" variable \`$0\`. It would also fail if \`$0\` contained no slash character, or contained a broken symlink, perhaps mistyped by the user. The way it would fail, as ensured by the \`&&\` conditional, and not having \`set -e\` cause termination on failure, was to produce the empty string. This failure mode was not checked, only commented as \\"Scary!\\". Finally, in the deletion command, the slash character takes on a very different meaning from its role of path concatenation operator when the string before it is empty, as it then names the root directory. *Minus World is an infamous glitch level from the 1985 game Super Mario Bros., accessed by using a bug to clip through walls in level 1-2 to reach its \\"warp zone\\", which leads to the said level. As this level is endless, triggering the bug that takes the player there will make the game impossible to continue until the player resets the game or runs out of lives. *\\"MissingNo.\\" is a glitch Pok√©mon species present in Pok√©mon Red and Blue, which can be encountered by performing a particular sequence of seemingly unrelated actions. Capturing this Pok√©mon may corrupt the game's data, according to Nintendo and some of the players who successfully attempted this glitch. This is one of the most famous bugs in video game history, and continues to be well-known. Encryption * In order to fix a warning issued by Valgrind, a maintainer of Debian patched OpenSSL and broke the random number generator in the process. The patch was uploaded in September 2006 and made its way into the official release; it was not reported until April 2008. Every key generated with the broken version is compromised (as the \\"random\\" numbers were made easily predictable), as is all data encrypted with it, threatening many applications that rely on encryption such as S/MIME, Tor, SSL or TLS protected connections and SSH. * Heartbleed, an OpenSSL vulnerability introduced in 2012 and disclosed in April 2014, removed confidentiality from affected services, causing among other things the shut down of the Canada Revenue Agency's public access to the online filing portion of its website following the theft of social insurance numbers. * The Apple \\"goto fail\\" bug was a duplicated line of code which caused a public key certificate check to pass a test incorrectly. * The GnuTLS \\"goto fail\\" bug was similar to the Apple bug and found about two weeks later. The GnuTLS bug also allowed attackers to bypass SSL/TLS security. The GnuTLS bug was worse than the Apple bug because it affected over 200 packages on a typical Linux system.  Transportation  * By some accounts Toyota's electronic throttle control system (ETCS) had bugs that could cause sudden unintended acceleration. * The Boeing 787 Dreamliner experienced an integer overflow bug which could shut down all electrical generators if the aircraft was on for more than 248 days. * In early 2019, the transportation-rental firm Lime discovered a firmware bug with its electric scooters that can cause them to brake unexpectedly very hard, which may hurl and injure riders. Finance * The Vancouver Stock Exchange index had large errors due to repeated rounding. In January 1982 the index was initialized at 1000 and subsequently updated and truncated to three decimal places on each trade. This was done about 3000 times a day. The accumulated truncations led to an erroneous loss of around 25 points per month. Over the weekend of November 25‚Äì28, 1983, the error was corrected, raising the value of the index from its Friday closing figure of 524.811 to 1098.892. * Knight Capital Group lost $440 million in 45 minutes due to the improper deployment of software on servers and the re-use of a critical software flag that caused old unused software code to execute during trading.

Biography Patricia Shaw spent her early years in Koo Wee Rup in Victoria, where her family owned a hotel. Her father was a bookmaker.Elisabeth Wynhausen, \\"Aussie Wunderfrau\\", Weekend Australian, 20‚Äì21 December 1997, Review, p. 9 After marrying, she and her husband moved to Surfers Paradise, Queensland in the late 1950s. Her husband was in the Royal Australian Navy and was mostly absent; after having two children, they divorced. For a number of years she was a member of the staff of Eric Robinson, member of parliament and a minister in the Fraser Government. On his sudden death in 1981, she received a widow's pension, supplemented by freelance writing. In 1983, she became head of the Oral History Department of the Parliamentary Library. Shaw was 52 years old before she began to write fiction. Among her many novels, most of which centre on the settlement of the Australian hinterland and which earned her the sobriquet of \\"Australia's Chronicler\\", the most widely known are River of the Sun (1991) and The Opal Seekers (1996). With a small amount of this money Patricia was able to buy herself a house at the Gold Coast, Queensland and begin writing. One of her books, 'The Glittering Fields', tells the story of this event and how it changed her life. Much of Shaw's popularity and success came from overseas. Her books were extremely successful in Germany. She spent a considerable amount of time in Germany because of this and earned the nickname \\"The Frankfurt Poet\\". She has also written two works of non-fiction regarding Australia's era of settlement. Patricia Shaw is also actively involved in the protection of Australia's native animals and birds.

However, data from the mapping of the lunar surface allows astronomers to predict the lunar profile for any given time with a high degree of certainty. The irregularity of the lunar limb is the cause of Baily's beads, which are collimated rays of sunlight that shine through in some places while not in others during a solar eclipse.

The region is located in the province of Udine and is sub-divided into three main sections; Ramandolo in the north, Cialla and Corno di Rosazzo. The climate and soil is very similar to the neighboring DOC of Collio Goriziano and the two region share many winemaking similarities as well. The main distinction between the Colli Orientali del Friuli and Collio Goriziano lie in the increased red and dessert wine production of the Colli Orientali del Friuli. The region also includes within its boundaries the three Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Ramandolo and the two passito wine DOCGs of Colli Orientali del Friuli Picolit and Colli Orientali del Friuli Picolit-Cialla.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 132-140 Hungry Minds 2001 History Viticulture has existed in the area since the time of the Romans. In 1866, during the Risorgimento, the region was united with Italy. In the 1970s, the white wines of the region began to receive international attention due to innovations in winemaking techniques that produced fresher, more vibrant white wines. In the 1980s, winemakers in the Colli Orientali del Friuli focused on increasing the quality of their red wine production. Following in the footsteps of the \\"Super Tuscan\\" producers, Friuli winemakers decided to produce red wines outside of DOC regulations under the vino da tavola designation. Fuller bodied white wines made from Chardonnay and Pinot bianco fermented in oak were also sold under vino da tavola to distinguish them from the crisp, lighter white wines that Colli Orientali del Friuli is typically associated with.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 187 Oxford University Press 2006 Grapes and wine The white wine production of the Colli Orientali del Friuli is dominated by the Friulano grape which accounts for nearly a third of the region's vineyard plantings. Other important white wine varieties include Sauvignon blanc, Pinot grigio, Verduzzo, Pinot bianco and Ribolla Gialla. The Picolit grape is the primary grape for sweet wines and is the main grape behind two of the regions DOCGs. Red wines account for around 35% of the region's entire production and is centered on the towns of Buttrio, Cividale del Friuli and Manzano. Merlot is the leading red wine variety followed by Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Pignolo, Refosco, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso and Schioppettino. Other DOCs and DOCGs In addition to the main Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC, there are two smaller DOCs centered on the sub- regions of Cialla and Corno di Rosazzo. The Colli Orientali del Friuli Cialla DOC is noted for its dry white wines and produces sweet and off dry wines from the Picolit and Verduzzo grapes. Dry red wines are produced in this region from the Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso and Schioppettino grapes. The Colli Orientali del Friuli Rosazzo DOC of Corno di Rosazzo is noted for its significant plantings of Ribolla Gialla which is believed to have originated in the region in the vineyard of the local abbey over 1000 years ago. Sweet wines made from the Picolit and dry wines from the Pignolo grapes are also common in this region. The dessert wines from the Picolit grape made in the passito style has two DOCG regions in the Colli Orientali del Friuli, the Colli Orientali del Friuli Picolit-Cialla DOCG is centered on the commune of Cialla while the Colli Orientali del Friuli Picolit DOCG encompasses most of the region.

The site, first excavated in 1930, was the first to provide a view of prehistoric human habitation in Prince William Sound, the ancestral home of the Chugach people, and is one of the two primary sites for identifying the sequence of occupation in the area. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Description The Palugvik site is located on the rocky shore of Hawkins Island, just west of the city of Cordova. The major feature of the site is a shell midden, and was at a somewhat higher elevation at the time of its human occupation. Since that time, the site has subsided, and was recorded in the 1960s as being about below the mean high tide level for the area. The first major archaeological survey of Prince William Sound was conducted in the 1930s by pioneering archaeologist Frederica de Laguna, at which time she led a major excavation at Palugvik. The shell midden, when first examined, measured about by , with a deposit depth of to , but this size has been greatly reduced due to erosion. The site also includes fragmented remnants of a residence, burial sites, and other artifacts. The evidence gathered dates the site from c. 500 BCE to the European contact period. The 1930 excavations yielded about 1100 artifacts. It also yielded information about the diet and hunting habits of the inhabitants, which including a significant marine diet of fish, several species of whale, as well as land-based fauna including marmot.

She was one of few members of nobility executed for sorcery in Scandinavia. As was the custom for children of the nobility, Christenze was sent to be brought up in a noble family other than her own, and she was raised at the estate Nakkeb√∂lle by Eiler Brockenhuus and his wife.  First trial  When Brockenhuus became a widower in 1582, Christenze had hoped that he would marry her, but in 1584, he married Anne Bille instead. Anne Bille bore seventeen children, who all died. When Anne's cousin bore a dead child in 1596, and accused three women for having caused the death by use of sorcery and had them burned at the stake, Anne begun to think that her own misfortune was caused by sorcery as well. She then followed the example of her cousin and accused a woman named √Öse Lauridses. √Öse confessed that the marital bed of Anne had been cursed at their wedding bed by Gunder Kaeldersvends, a demon, and Christenze Kruckow. Another of the accused women, Johanne Jensens, added that Christenze had been present at a witches' sabbath at Bloksberg. Johanne Jensens was burned at the stake for witchcraft, but the authorities did not wish to accuse a member of the nobility, and the brother of Christenze got her a new home with her sister in √Ölborg.  Second trial  In 1611, rumors were circulating in the city of √Ölborg of strange diseases and speaking cats and pigs in the cemetery. In 1619, the authorities investigated. Several women were burned at the stake for sorcery in this witch trial, and they pointed out Christenze as one of them, but the authorities did not wish to accuse a member of the nobility. The king, Christian IV of Denmark, however, who had a great interest in witchcraft, encouraged people to accuse her. A priest accused her of having caused the death of his wife; Peder Poulsen had seen her as one of the witches present when a witch gave birth to an ogre; and S√∂ren Tommermand had been victim of a knife attack after Kruckow had promised him misfortune. Christenze was then arrested. She admitted that she had cursed the bridal bed of Anne Bille years before, and that she had disliked the wife of the priest. She was judged guilty and sentenced to death for sorcery. The punishment for sorcery was to be burned to death. Christenze, however, was decapitated with a sword as a privilege of her noble status. She was then buried according to all appropriate ceremonials of the church, a burial not always given to executed witches. In Scandinavia, it was unusual for a member of the nobility to be tried for sorcery. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, only one such case each are known; in Sweden, the noblewoman Kerstin Ulfsax was executed in 1585.

Armstrong. Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, the COG-PKG is an international church which is mostly active on the Internet. It was founded in 1998 by Ronald Weinland, a former WCG minister and convicted tax evader who has made a number of public end times predictions.\\"Jesus returning on May 27?

In November 2012, Weinland was sentenced to 42 months in prison for tax evasion; he began his prison term in February 2013, though he continued to issue sermons and prophecies to his followers. Founder The COG-PKG is led by its founder Ronald Weinland (born May 30, 1949), a Colorado-born minister who served in the WCG from 1981 to 1995. When the church made major doctrinal changes after Herbert Armstrong's death in 1986, Weinland moved to the United Church of God (UCG). He served the UCG's Toledo, Ohio, congregation until 1997, when he departed after issuing an open letter to the church criticizing its management. In 1998, Weinland started publishing a newsletter called \\"News Watch\\", which ran for about four years and helped establish the prophetic themes of his later ministry. He founded the COG-PKG in 1998. On August 4, 2005 Weinland suffered from a heart attack after which he proclaimed himself as a prophet and an apostle of the God in Christianity. Weinland's deteriorating health led him to suffer a second heart attack during his prison sentence on May 28, 2015. =Tax evasion trial and imprisonment= On November 10, 2011, Weinland was indicted by a federal grand jury on five charges of tax evasion. It was alleged that he had understated his income on federal tax returns, redirected COG-PKG church funds for personal use and concealed the existence of a Swiss bank account. Weinland admitted that church funds were placed in a bank account in Switzerland and that his was one of the two names on the account, but denied that there was any tax evasion, and stated that all funds had since been repatriated to the United States and used for church advertising. Weinland informed his church before opening the account, in a December 2002 sermon entitled \\"Planning Ahead\\". Weinland's trial began on June 4, 2012.\\"Criminal Trial News Day 1\\".

He remained under house detention and electronic surveillance until his sentencing hearing. On November 14, 2012, Weinland was sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment and a $245,000 tax restitution; his prison term ended in 2016. Church history=Development= Weinland founded the COG-PKG in 1998, drawing followers from UCG's Toledo congregation and ex-WCG members in Georgia and Texas. Prior to his imprisonment, Weinland delivered his sermons weekly on Saturday afternoons to church members throughout the United States and Canada via live streaming audio on the Internet. The COG-PKG also has a number of members overseas who listen to recordings of the sermons. The church's headquarters are located in Cincinnati, Ohio. In a 2009 sermon, Weinland warned that critics who mocked him or the COG-PKG would be divinely cursed with \\"a sickness that will eat them from the inside out\\". =Predictions= Under Weinland's tutelage, the COG-PKG has adopted an apocalyptic belief in the imminent end of the existing world order. Weinland has repeatedly predicted the swift return of Jesus Christ, whom he believes will set up the Kingdom of God upon the Earth. This view was expressed in Weinland's books, The Prophesied End-Time and 2008 ‚Äì God's Final Witness. In 2006, Weinland identified himself to be \\"the spokesman of [God's] two end-time witnesses\\", who are mentioned in the Book of Revelation.Revelation 11:1. \\"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.\\" In an April 2008 sermon, he identified his wife, Laura, as the other witness of Revelation,Stated on Ronald Weinland's blog entry \\"Second Witness\\" .

May 27, 2012, passed without Weinland's predicted apocalypse. In a blog posting dated May 26, 2012, Weinland acknowledged that \\"nothing has begun in the world that would signal the need or purpose for ... Christ's return\\". He urged his followers to \\"move forward\\", and suggested that God had been, and continued to be, merciful to his people. He later stated that the end of the world had indeed begun on May 27, 2012, but would take \\"one year to become fulfilled\\". Weinland next asserted that Christ would return on May 19, 2013 (Pentecost Sunday), but later withdrew this prediction. In a blog post dated May 13, 2013, Weinland stated that Christ would return on some future Pentecost Sunday, but only when the Earth had endured \\"much suffering\\"; he did not give a specific year. He expressed hope that members would remain with the church after May 19, 2013, which passed without any apocalyptic event.  Pentecost predictions for 2019  June 9th is the date prophesied by Weinland in his book Prophecy Against the Nations as the second coming of Jesus Christ, which would be preceded by several biblical events in conjunction with the start of World War III. During the time leading up to this date, Weinland began to express uncertainties in his prediction by issuing statements such as \\"not everything is going to pan out the way you thought\\" or \\"Is Christ About to Return?\\" on his website.

The film stars Loretta Young and Robert Cummings.. Plot Wilma Tuttle (Young) is a college professor who becomes the target of the sexual interest of her student Bill Perry (Douglas Dick). When Perry tries to rape Tuttle, she beats him to death with an auto part, unintentionally, in a terrified effort of self defense. She covers up her crime by making it seem as though Perry was killed while diving into the sea from a precipitous cliff. As she follows the police investigation of Perry's death, Wilma realizes that she'll never be able to escape her conscience, especially when she falls in love with Warren Ford (Cummings), the dead boy's guardian.

Young says that shortly before filming, Wallis approached her suggesting that the two actors swap roles, with Cummings to play the detective and Corey the male lead. Young said: \\"I knew he wanted to switch because he had just put Wendell Corey under contract, and Robert Cummings was being eased out.\\" Young said it was up to Wallis but felt Corey was not a leading man. \\"He was a very attractive second lead.

It's an intelligent delineation, gifting the role with life. She gets under the skin in bringing out the mental processes of an intelligent woman who knows she has done wrong but believes that her trail is so covered that murder will never out.\\"Variety.

Definition Let X be a proper variety. By definition, a (real) 1-cycle on X is a formal linear combination C=\\\\sum a_iC_i of irreducible, reduced and proper curves C_i, with coefficients a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. Numerical equivalence of 1-cycles is defined by intersections: two 1-cycles C and C' are numerically equivalent if C \\\\cdot D = C' \\\\cdot D for every Cartier divisor D on X. Denote the real vector space of 1-cycles modulo numerical equivalence by N_1(X). We define the cone of curves of X to be : NE(X) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum a_i[C_i], \\\\ 0 \\\\leq a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where the C_i are irreducible, reduced, proper curves on X, and [C_i] their classes in N_1(X). It is not difficult to see that NE(X) is indeed a convex cone in the sense of convex geometry. Applications One useful application of the notion of the cone of curves is the Kleiman condition, which says that a (Cartier) divisor D on a complete variety X is ample if and only if D \\\\cdot x > 0 for any nonzero element x in \\\\overline{NE(X)}, the closure of the cone of curves in the usual real topology. (In general, NE(X) need not be closed, so taking the closure here is important.) A more involved example is the role played by the cone of curves in the theory of minimal models of algebraic varieties. Briefly, the goal of that theory is as follows: given a (mildly singular) projective variety X, find a (mildly singular) variety X' which is birational to X, and whose canonical divisor K_{X'} is nef. The great breakthrough of the early 1980s (due to Mori and others) was to construct (at least morally) the necessary birational map from X to X' as a sequence of steps, each of which can be thought of as contraction of a K_X-negative extremal ray of NE(X). This process encounters difficulties, however, whose resolution necessitates the introduction of the flip. A structure theorem The above process of contractions could not proceed without the fundamental result on the structure of the cone of curves known as the Cone Theorem. The first version of this theorem, for smooth varieties, is due to Mori; it was later generalised to a larger class of varieties by Koll√°r, Reid, Shokurov, and others. Mori's version of the theorem is as follows: Cone Theorem. Let X be a smooth projective variety. Then 1\\\\. There are countably many rational curves C_i on X, satisfying 0< -K_X \\\\cdot C_i \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{dim} X +1 , and : \\\\overline{NE(X)} = \\\\overline{NE(X)}_{K_X\\\\geq 0} + \\\\sum_i \\\\mathbf{R}_{\\\\geq0} [C_i]. 2\\\\. For any positive real number \\\\epsilon and any ample divisor H, : \\\\overline{NE(X)} = \\\\overline{NE(X)}_{K_X+\\\\epsilon H\\\\geq0} + \\\\sum \\\\mathbf{R}_{\\\\geq0} [C_i], where the sum in the last term is finite. The first assertion says that, in the closed half-space of N_1(X) where intersection with K_X is nonnegative, we know nothing, but in the complementary half-space, the cone is spanned by some countable collection of curves which are quite special: they are rational, and their 'degree' is bounded very tightly by the dimension of X. The second assertion then tells us more: it says that, away from the hyperplane \\\\\\\\{C : K_X \\\\cdot C = 0\\\\\\\\}, extremal rays of the cone cannot accumulate. If in addition the variety X is defined over a field of characteristic 0, we have the following assertion, sometimes referred to as the Contraction Theorem: 3\\\\. Let F \\\\subset \\\\overline{NE(X)} be an extremal face of the cone of curves on which K_X is negative. Then there is a unique morphism \\\\operatorname{cont}_F : X \\\\rightarrow Z to a projective variety Z, such that (\\\\operatorname{cont}_F)_* \\\\mathcal{O}_X = \\\\mathcal{O}_Z and an irreducible curve C in X is mapped to a point by \\\\operatorname{cont}_F if and only if [C] \\\\in F.

Her political activism followed her involuntary confinement in a psychiatric facility in the 1960s. She was the author of On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System, which is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement. Early life Judi Chamberlin was born Judith Rosenberg in Brooklyn in 1944. She was the only daughter of Harold and Shirley Jaffe Rosenberg. The family later changed their name to Ross. Her father was a factory worker when she was a child http://www.community-consortium.org/projects/chamberlin-judy.pdf and later worked as an executive in the advertising industry. Her mother was employed as a school secretary. Chamberlin graduated from Midwood High School. After graduation, she had no plans of attending college and worked as a secretary instead. Psychiatric experience In 1966, at the age of twenty-one and recently married, Chamberlin suffered a miscarriage and, according to her own account, became severely depressed. Following psychiatric advice, she voluntarily signed herself into a psychiatric facility as an in-patient. However, after several voluntary admissions she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York state for a period of five months.J.M. Lawrence states that she was involuntarily committed for a period of two months. As an involuntary patient, she witnessed and experienced a range of abuses. Seclusion rooms and refractory wards were used for resistive patients, even when their forms of resistance were non-violent. The psychiatric medication she was given made her feel tired and affected her memory. As an involuntary patient she was unable to leave the facility and became, she said, \\"a prisoner of the system\\". The derogation of her civil liberties that she experienced as an inmate provided the impetus for her activism as a member of the psychiatric survivor movement. Activism Following her discharge, Chamberlin became involved in the nascent psychiatric patients' rights movement. In 1971 she joined the Boston-based Mental Patients Liberation Front (MPLF), and she also became associated with the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Boston University . Her affiliation with this center facilitated her role in co- founding the Ruby Rogers Advocacy and Drop-in-Centers, which are self-help institutions staffed by former psychiatric patients. and was also a founder and later a Director of Education of the National Empowerment Center. The latter is also an ex-patient run organization that provides information, technical assistance, and support to users and survivors of the psychiatric system. Its mission statement declares its intent is to \\"carry a message of recovery, empowerment, hope and healing to people who have been labeled with mental illness\\". She was also involved with the National Association for Rights Protection and Advocacy and was an influential leader in the Mad Pride movement. Chamberlin met David Oaks in 1976, when he was the chief executive of MindFreedom International. They were both members of the Mental Patients Liberation Front. She later became a board member of MindFreedom International, an umbrella organization for approximately one hundred grass roots groups campaigning for the human rights of people labeled \\"mentally ill.\\" In 1978, her book On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System was published. It became the standard text of the psychiatric survivor movement, and in it Chamberlain coined the word \\"mentalism.\\" She used the word \\"mentalism\\" also in a book chapter in 1975. She was a major contributor to the National Council on Disability's report From Privileges to Rights: People Labeled with Psychiatric Disabilities Speak for Themselves, which was published in 2000. The report argued that psychiatric patients should enjoy the same basic human rights as other citizens and that patient privileges contingent on good behavior within the psychiatric system, such as the ability to wear their own clothes, leave the confines of a psychiatric facility, or receive visitors, should instead be regarded as basic rights. Chamberlin was elected as co-chair of the World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry (WNUSP) at the launching conference and General Assembly in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 2001, and served in this capacity until the next General Assembly in 2004. During this period she also served on the Panel of Experts advising the United Nations special rapporteur on disability, on behalf of WNUSP in its role as a Non-governmental organization, representing psychiatric survivors. She appears in the 2011 disability rights documentary Lives Worth Living. Personal life Her marriages to Robert Chamberlin, Ted Chabasinski, and Howard Cahn ended in divorce . Chamberlin met Chabasinski, also an early member of the psychiatric survivor movement, in 1971 at the initial meeting of the Mental Patients Liberation Project in New York City. From 2006 until her death, Chamberlin's partner was Martin Federman. She has one daughter, Julie Chamberlin, and three grandchildren, Edward, Kyle, and Vivian.

After a preview in Manchester, Twang!! opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End on 20 December 1965 and closed on 29 January 1966 after just 43 performances, receiving scathing reviews and playing to mostly empty houses.Roper, p. 98 Bart produced it with Bernard Delfont and John Bryan, and Joan Littlewood directed but quit before it opened.

Littlewood demanded a rewrite, but constant, confusing revisions failed to improve the script. Littlewood, the choreographer Paddy Stone, the designer Oliver Messel, and the writers failed to work together. Rehearsals were disorganised and fraught with tension; Bart was drinking; Littlewood threatened to walk out. At a rehearsal, Littlewood accused Bart of failing to fulfill his creative responsibilities because he was too strung-out on LSD.Roper, p. 88 Bart, in turn, accused Littlewood of ruining the piece.Twang, 1965 shows, Over the Footlights, accessed 25 December 2012 A Birmingham tryout was scheduled and cancelled. A Manchester preview opened on 3 November 1965 at the Palace Theatre with a script that was unfinished. Word of the disaster leaked to the tabloids. Littlewood quit the company, and a script doctor, American Burt Shevelove, was brought in to fix the script and score, leading to more confusing changes, but nothing helped. The scenes had no relation to the songs, and Twang!! transferred to London preceded by continued bad press.Roper, p. 89 The show opened in disarray at London's Shaftesbury Theatre on 20 December 1965. Still, Bart thought he could save the show. On opening night, the musical director, Ken Moule, collapsed of exhaustion and still had failed to orchestrate the second act. Two songs were cut in the hours before the curtain rose, and the piece was played for camp, even adding some transvestism.Roper, p. 92 The house lights kept going up and down throughout the performance, and vicious arguments were overheard backstage.Roper, p. 94 Twang!! garnered scornful and derisive reviews. The critics noted the lack of heroics and the pseudo-pantomime delivery,Roper, pp. 94‚Äì95, although there were some effective musical sequences, including a scene around a gallows that became a morris dance around a maypole.Parker, 1979 Windsor also came in for some praise. The show had been intended as a romp that poked fun at the Crusades, the attitude of the Church and the human flaw of wanting to turn an outlaw into a hero. Orkin believed the show failed because they failed to establish the exact butt of that satire; it was too vague and inconsequential. Bart lost his personal fortune in Twang!! and was devastated by the failure of the show.Roper, pp. 88‚Äì89 So was Booth, who made no money for a year while preparing for it.Blackwell, Diana.

During the period from 1906 to 1914, Leffingwell spent nine summers and six winters on the Arctic coast of Alaska, making 31 trips by dog sled or small boats. He created the first accurate map of a large part of the Alaskan arctic coastline. He was the first to scientifically describe permafrost and to pose theories about permafrost which have largely proven true. He accurately identified the oil potential of the North Slope region of Alaska. Biography Staff of the Anglo-American Polar Expedition (1906): Ernest de Koven Leffingwell (left), Captain Ejnar Mikkelsen, G. P. Howe, Ejnar Ditlevsen Ernest de Koven Leffingwell was born January 13, 1875, in Knoxville, Illinois, to Charles and Elizabeth (n√©e Francis) Leffingwell. He attended the grammar school at Racine College, then attended Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, where he was captain of the track team his senior year, graduated with the AB degree in 1895 and was awarded a MA in 1900. He studied physics and geology at the University of Chicago 1896 to 1898 and 1900 to 1906. He played on the Chicago Maroons football team. Leffingwell had passed his preliminary examination and was a doctoral candidate when he left for Alaska in 1906 but apparently did not complete the degree. He taught science at St Alban's school in Knoxville, Illinois, in 1895‚Äì96 and 1903‚Äì04, in the latter period also serving as Superintendent. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War he served as a Seaman on the US battleship Oregon during its celebrated dash around Cape Horn and in the Battle of Santiago.\\"Ernest DeKoven Leffingwell\\" One thousand American men of mark today American Men of Mark, New York, 1916\\"Obituaries\\" \\"Ernest deKoven Leffingwell\\" Polar Record 16 (101) pp. 282‚Äì83, 1971Phi Upsilon Fraternity (1917) The twelfth general Catalogue of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity p642Ernest deKoven Leffingwell Alumni Folder, Trinity College Archives, Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut.The University Record (University of Chicago) v11 p 40, 1907\\"Events and Comment\\" \\"'Leff', Polar Bearer\\" University of Chicago Magazine 7 (3) January 1915. p 69. He led the science staff in the 1901 Baldwin-Ziegler North Pole Expedition, which failed in its attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land. On this expedition, he became friends with Danish explorer Ejnar Mikkelsen. Subsequently, the two raised funds for their own expedition. Leffingwell's father, who had become wealthy from his ownership of a fruit ranch in California, contributed $5000, and Mikkelsen raised a comparable amount in England and New York. Their venture became the Anglo- American Polar Expedition of 1906‚Äì1908 which aimed to explore the Beaufort Sea. At that time, many experts believed than an undiscovered land mass lay in this region, since such a mass could account for observed patterns of arctic currents and tides.Mills, William James (2003) \\"Mikkelsen, Ejnar (1880‚Äì1971)\\" Exploring polar frontiers: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1 pp 426 ff, ABC- CLIO , Leffingwell 1915a The underfunded expedition fared badly but achieved some positive results. No new land was discovered, but they delineated part of the continental shelf and Leffingwell began his mapping efforts. Their ship, the Duchess of Bedford, was locked in pack ice and destroyed, but they salvaged the wood to build a cabin which Leffingwell used intermittently through 1914. Mikkelsen returned to the US in 1907, but Leffingwell remained on the arctic coast for another year. He returned to the North Slope 1909‚Äì1912 and 1913‚Äì1914, working with one assistant to map 250 km of the arctic coast, and the Canning River valley . Leffingwell's base on Flaxman Island, circa 1910 After spending a year and a half writing up his results at the United States Geological Survey in Washington, Leffingwell retired to Whittier, California, listing his occupation in 1917 as citriculturist. He moved to Carmel, California, about 20 years later. When he died in 1971, fourteen days after his 96th birthday, he was believed to have been the oldest surviving polar explorer. Leffingwell camp site The Leffingwell Camp Site located on a remote barrier island off Alaska, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978. and Honors Leffingwell was awarded the Patron's Medal by the Royal Geographical Society and the Charles P. Daly Medal by the American Geographical Society, both in 1922. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Trinity College in 1923. Leffingwell Fork, a stream on Alaska's North Slope, Leffingwell Ridge (Brooks Range) in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Leffingwell Glacier in the Romanzoff Mountains of the Brooks Range, Leffingwell Crags in Canada's Northwest Territories, and Leffingwell Nunatak in Greenland are named for him.

And later, according to Nicolaus of Damascus, he adopted Cyrus as a helper in the Median court. Herodotus recounts: :When the boy [Cyrus] was in his tenth year, an accident which I will now relate, caused it to be discovered who he was. He was at play one day in the village where the folds of the cattle were, along with the boys of his own age, in the street. The other boys who were playing with him chose the cowherd's son, as he was called, to be their king. He then proceeded to order them about some he set to build him houses, others he made his guards, one of them was to be the king's eye, another had the office of carrying his messages; all had some task or other. Among the boys there was one, the son of Artembares, a Mede of distinction, who refused to do what Cyrus had set him. Cyrus told the other boys to take him into custody, and when his orders were obeyed, he chastised him most severely with the whip. The son of Artembares, as soon as he was let go, full of rage at treatment so little befitting his rank, hastened to the city and complained bitterly to his father of what had been done to him by Cyrus. He did not, of course, say \\"Cyrus,\\" by which name the boy was not yet known, but called him the son of the king's cowherd. Artembares, in the heat of his passion, went to Astyages, accompanied by his son, and made complaint of the gross injury which had been done him. Pointing to the boy's shoulders, he exclaimed, \\"Thus, oh! king, has thy slave, the son of a cowherd, heaped insult upon us.\\" :At this sight and these words Astyages, wishing to avenge the son of Artembares for his father's sake, sent for the cowherd and his boy. When they came together into his presence, fixing his eyes on Cyrus, Astyages said, \\"Hast thou then, the son of so mean a fellow as that, dared to behave thus rudely to the son of yonder noble, one of the first in my court?\\" \\"My lord,\\" replied the boy, \\"I only treated him as he deserved. I was chosen king in play by the boys of our village, because they thought me the best for it. He himself was one of the boys who chose me. All the others did according to my orders; but he refused, and made light of them, until at last he got his due reward.

History The planning of the Winslow-Allen mansion, also known as Oak View, started in 1868. Construction began in 1870 for Francis Olney Winslow. F.O. Winslow was the scion of a local tanning family who expanded the family business interests on a large scale. Born in 1844, he constructed the mansion, which was finished in 1873. F.O. Winslow died in 1926. Upon Winslow's death, Oak View passed into the hands of his daughter Clara Winslow and her husband, Frank G. Allen (married December 2, 1897) who was soon thereafter to become Governor of Massachusetts. Some of the most prominent figures hosted in Oak View during those years were President (and later a Supreme Court Justice) William Howard Taft, President Calvin Coolidge, Russian Composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, artist John Singer Sargent, Episcopal Bishop of Boston Phillips Brooks and philosopher William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Viscount Kentaro Kaneko of Japan, tenor John McCormack and others of similar stature. In 1954, the Allens sold Oak View to the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity. In 1978 it was sold to Barbara Rand and Robert Pegurri who own it still Oak View has been the site of Oak View Museum of Dollhouses since 1989. OakView Preservation Incorporated (OVPI) OakView Preservation Incorporated formed as a non-profit corporation, organized in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to raise funds to purchase and preserve the home called ‚ÄúOak View‚Äù located in Norwood, Massachusetts. Oak View was used as a Governor‚Äôs Mansion in 1929 and home to industrialist George Winslow from its beginning in 1872. OVPI will protect the building as a home and museum. As a museum, operated by OakView Preservation Incorporated, OakView will promote discovery, learning, education and an appreciation for the period of antiquity and our natural, cultural and artistic heritage. After purchase and preservation, OVPI‚Äôs core activities will be collecting, curating, exhibition and education. Collection Collection shall focus on materials, objects and information that foster improved cultural understanding and appreciation of the character that is our heritage. This will include historical objects and information on the Town of Norwood, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Industrialists of antiquity, builders of the home and Victoriana. Curator Curatorial efforts will continue to upgrade collections to ensure that they are preserved and that collections and associated information are made accessible to the general public through the efforts of OakView Preservation Incorporated also known as OVPI. Exhibition Exhibition of collections will focus on themes that integrate information and concepts from across disciplines, and that foster a better understanding and appreciation for the diverse cultural heritage that defines us all. Tax Status OakView Preservation Incorporated is a corporation, not-for-profit. On December 18, 2007 OakView Preservation Incorporated received the determination letter form the IRS granting the 501(c)(3) status. OakView Preservation Incorporated became one step closer to the purchase Oak View, preservation of Oak View and sharing Oak View with the general public through self and guided tours and as a museum. Successful operation of the museum will be accomplished by year three after organization and based on the support from friends, members and contributors. By actively soliciting donations and keeping costs to less than 15% of each dollar contributed, OVPI will be and remain debt free and thus a strong, preservation entity and corporation. Objectives OakView Preservation Incorporated (OVPI) objectives include: *To care about the past and honor the achievements of previous generations and the places they lived, specifically Oak View in Norwood, Massachusetts. *Preserve Oak View for the future by protecting our past, and remember how we came to be, where we are, and what we ought to do. This objective gives rise to OakView Preservation Incorporated‚Äôs motto of ‚ÄúPast, Present, Future‚Äù. *To care about giving future generations the same opportunities to enjoy this and other beautiful buildings and landscapes that we have today. *To educate the public on the important role that Oak View played in our history. This will be accomplished through a public museum on- premises, and other educational and cultural events sponsored by and executed by OakView Preservation Incorporated. *To always keep the future in mind through continued renovations, restorations, providing education for the volunteer-staff for the museum, and treating the house as a living museum for the ages in perpetuity. *To promote discovery, learning, and an appreciation for the period of antiquity and our natural, cultural and artistic heritage. After acquisition through raising funds, OVPI‚Äôs core activities as a result of fundraising will be collecting, curetting, exhibition and education. OakView Preservation Incorporated exists to conserve and preserve the environment surrounding Oak View, the home and the building for current and future generations; to ensure that the area around the house is never allowed to be encroached upon; to treat all the land as if it were a Park; to encourage all of The Public to use and enjoy Oak View in perpetuity; to provide resources for collection, curation, exhibition and education; to raise public awareness about historic preservation and cultural heritage common to all. Preservation cares about the past. Preservation cares about honoring the achievements of previous generations, the places they lived and worked and the history and achievements we now enjoy. Preservation also cares about the present and the future. By protecting our past, it helps us remember how we came to be, where we are, and where we are going. Preservation cares about giving future generations the same opportunities to enjoy beautiful places like Oak View and landscapes and buildings that we have today.

Cit, p. 81 Append. I, item 57.-284) was a Roman citizen of the third century AD. First known to history as a high-flying professional soldier, he went on to serve as an acting provincial governor and finally became Praetorian Prefect, under the emperor Carus - in effect vice principis (a term best understood as 'the emperor's deputy'). This rendered him hugely influential in the government of the empire - not excepting in matters of Peace and War. Aper's career coincided with and benefited from the momentous changes in the structure of the Roman army and the Roman state introduced in the middle years of the Third Century that brought men such as himself - i.e. members of the Roman equestrian order with a strong military background - to the fore in the public administration. Almost certainly he would have been a man of considerable ability. However, as was almost invariably the case with those who rose to the highest levels in the Imperial Service, the main element that fuelled Aper's rise to the highest levels was his access to powerful military and political patronage. In his case this derived from his relationship with Carus which began when they were both serving soldiers and not only survived, but even flourished after Carus's accession to the principate by which time he was already the father-in-law of Carus's son, the future emperor Numerian. On the death of Carus, an event quickly followed by the demise of Numerian, this essential prop to Aper's position was gone. Almost immediately, bad luck and bad judgement brought him into competition for primacy with Diocles, commander of the Domestici'Domestici' was the term used in the later fourth century (SHA :Vita Cari 13.1): thought to refer to a close-security unit of the palace guard - see Protectores Augusti and future Emperor Diocletian. This was to have rapid and fatal consequences, not only for Aper's career, but for his very life. Background Nothing is known of Aper's origins or the date and circumstances of his birth. The praenomen and nomen with which Aper is associated (i.e. 'Lucius' and 'Flavius' respectively) are known only from an epigraph commemorating a man named Aper from Poetovio - see below.Arch. Ertesito (AE), 1936, Nos. 53, 54, 57 Poetovio. The epigraph honorand is generally held by modern historians to be identified with the Aper here considered. If the latter's nomen was indeed 'Flavius', it may be remarked that he shared it with the future emperor, Constantius Chlorus. However, no familial relationship between the two men has ever been established. Aper's cognomen (i.e. 'Aper') translates into English as 'wild boar'. Again, is not known whether this was a diacritic associated with that branch of the Flavian clan to which Aper is thought to have belonged or whether ir was a nickname derived from some personal characteristic of the man himself. Career=Early appointments= As intimated above, Aper is identified with the Aper who was commemorated on the epigraph dated 267-8 found at Poetovio, in Pannonia Superior (now Ptuj, Slovenia).For the identification of Aper with the subject of the Poetovio inscription see Malcus, p 221. The inscription describes Aper as a vir egregius praepositus legionum V Macedonicae atque XIII Geminae. Poetovio was an important fortress on the River Sava which controlled the approaches to Italy through the Julian Alps It cannot be determined whether Aper commanded the fortress garrison or whether he answered to a superior officer who would probably have been styed as a dux The force under Aper's command would have consisted of elements (i.e. vexillationes) of the legions mentioned rather than the legions themselves, (There is no known instance of a praepositus commanding a full legionary establishment, let alone two). The increasing use of composite formations such as that under Aper was a phenomenon of the mid-Third Century. Such units were independent of the regular command-structures of the frontier garrisons as traditionally deployed reflecting the strategic reaction of the imperial government to the anarchic situation in the Danube provinces (and also,incidentally, in Mesopotamia and Syria) caused by incessant incursions by northern barbarians (and the forces of the Persian Empire) into Roman territory and savage civil conflicts which were in large measure a consequence of the failure of the imperial government to control such incursions. The traditional deployment of the army in the pre-emptive defense of the frontiers had largely broken down by the 250s in the face of these threats. The new strategy which relied on ad hoc mobile expeditionary forces brought about a great expansion of the command-opportunities for officers of equestrian as opposed to senatorial rank. These were for the most part professional soldiers who had achieved their equestrian status by rising through the ranks of the legionary centurionate.For a discussion of the significance of the equestrian officials with military backgrounds kn the Third Century see B. Dobson , Op. Cit and also B. Malcus, passim. Aper is also identifiedAgain, see Malcus, op. cit.. with the officer commemorated on an undated epigraph from Aquincum in Pannonia Inferior (Budapest, Hungary.Corpus Inscriptionum Latinorum (CIL) III, 3424, 10424 Aquincum. There he is shown as a vir egregius agens vices praesidis. This wording indicates that, while his equestrian social status remained the same, Aper was now acting governor of Pannonia Inferior. There is no way of knowing the specific circumstances that had led the Imperial Authorities to give Aper this posting, but the most likely reason was that the local situation required a man with military experience and that no suitable senatorial could be found. As in the case of Aper's earlier appointment in Poetovio, the prevailing disorder made this a problem that increasingly confronted the Imperial government and that, increasingly, the solution was to appoint an equestrian officer pro temp. By 283 it had been possible to find a senator able/willing to do the job in Pannonia Inferior. However, the problem of finding suitable senators to govern devastated provinces was still endemic and under Diocletian's regime the process of making the government of provinces a largely equestrian function was carried to its logical conclusionSee Malcus and Petersen, Op.Cit. passim. =Apog√©e and downfall= At the outset of the reign of the Emperor Numerian (284) a man named Aper (perhaps Arrius Aper) was already en poste as Praetorian Prefect.Vita Cari, 13.2; 15.4; Vict., Caes, 38.6; Zonar., XII. 31, p 613; cf. 30, p. 611; Syncell., Chron., p. 724; Chron. Pasch, p 510) The Vita Cari also says that he was the father of Numerian's wife. It is probable that this Aper was the same man as the one already noted as praepositus of a detached force and as the former equestrian vice praeses of Pannonia.Howe. Op. Cit However, he is thought to have been prefect during the war with Persia initiated by Numerian's father, Carus and he had probably been given that office at the outset of Carus's reign in 282.Howe, Op. Cit. Aper is considered likely to have been the unnamed prefect who is said in the Vita Cari to have urged Carus to make war on Persia, hoping that Carus and Numerian would perish and he himself obtain the Purple.Vita Cari, 8.2; Howe, Op. Cit. It is thus insinuated, but not directly asserted that he was responsible for the death of both men during and after that campaign. The usual caveats are suggested regarding information based on the Augustan History. The truth is unknowable. Historian Pat Southern, points to Aper's scheming as the most likely reason for Carus's unexpected death while campaigning against the Sasanian Empire. What is incontestable is that when Numerian (who was by that time the Emperor following the death of his father) died as the Imperial comitatus returned from its victorious campaign in Persia. The traditional story is that Aper hid the body in a closed litter, told everyone that the emperor was irritated by the dust and light during the retreat, and issued orders in the emperor's name until the scent of the rotting corpse exposed his scheme. Aper was accused of his murder by the army and put on trial at Nicomedia (Izmit, Turkey). The suspicion of murder evidently arose because Aper had attempted to conceal the fact of Numerian's death, perhaps while he prepared the ground for his own accession to the Purple. Diocles, commander of the Domestici, then gave early proof of his capacity for ruthless and decisive action (that was to later distinguish him as Emperor) by pronouncing Aper the murderer and executing him on the spot by plunging his sword into his breast, thus giving him no chance to justify himself‚Äîor, perhaps, to implicate Diocles in Numerian's demise.Vita Car., 12-13; Vict., Caes 38.4 f; Eutrop IX. 18; 20; Zonar XII. 30 f, p 611; Syncell, Chron, p 724 f; Oros VII, 24.4. Flavius Vopiscus relates that Diocletian did this to fulfill a prophecy which had been delivered to him by a female druid, \\"Imperator eris, cum Aprum occideris.\\"Flavius Vopiscus, Augustan History, Numerian 12-14Aurel. Vict. de Caes. 38, 39, Epit. 38Eutrop. 9.12, 13 The historian Edward Gibbon was to say of this episode: > A charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without contradiction > and the legions with repeated acclamations acknowledged the justice and > authority of the Emperor Diocletian.Gibbon: History of the Decline and fall > of the Roman Empire, CXII Historian Pat Southern described Diocletian's story about Aper's scheming as ridiculous. She argued that although unlikely, it is possible that Aper could have lost his nerve because he feared retribution from suspicious soldiers if Carus had actually died of natural causes, and he claimed that the late emperor's son had also died in the same manner shortly afterwards. Aper's death is placed in autumn 284.

It runs east through Griquatown to Kimberley (Capital of the Northern Cape). It enters as Schmidtsdrift Road, then Long Street, and reaches a junction with the N12, just west of the N12's intersection with the R64. It turns south-east to be co-signed with the N12 as Bultfontein Road up to the Bishops Road junction, where the N12 turns south, leaving the N8 as the south- easterly road. At the roundabout by Kimberley Boys High School, the N8 turns south as Oliver Street, then south-east as Nathan Street, to exit the Northern Cape and cross into the Free State province. From Kimberley, on a recently upgraded stretch of road, the N8 goes eastwards for 150 kilometres, crossing the Modder River, through Petrusburg (Where it meets the northern terminus of the R48), to Bloemfontein (Capital of the Free State), where it meets the N1 (Bloemfontein Western Bypass) at a ramp junction. The N8 joins the N1 Highway northwards up to the next off-ramp, where it meets the eastern terminus of the R64. As the R64 is the road to the west, the N8 becomes the road to the east, bypassing the University of the Free State, into Bloemfontein Central. In the Bloemfontein CBD, the N8 passes through as two one-way streets. At the junction with the M30 Metropolitan Route, the N8 becomes one street eastwards again (Alexandra Avenue). After the Bloemfontein town centre, the N8 heads eastwards to form an interchange with the M10 Metropolitan Route (George Lubbe Street) and proceeds to bypass the Bram Fischer International Airport and the Air Force Base Bloemspruit. From the airport, it runs eastwards for 78 kilometres, through Botshabelo and Thaba Nchu, to reach the southern outskirts of Ladybrand. 12 kilometres before Ladybrand, the N8 is joined by the R26 Route and they are co-signed eastwards up to Ladybrand South, where the N8 becomes its own road southwards while the R26 turns north towards Ladybrand CBD. From the R26 split, the N8 goes southwards for 12 kilometres to end on the Lesotho border at the Maseru Bridge on the Mohokare River, with the city of Maseru, Lesotho's Capital, on the other side of the river.

The Neapolitan horse was frequently mentioned in literature from the 16th to the 19th centuries, and is noted for its quality. Corte wrote in 1562: \\"in Italy the horses of the Kingdom of Naples are greatly esteemed; [there] many fine coursers are born ... suitable for use in war and in the man√®ge and for every service that the rider may require\\". The decline of the breed was noted in the early 20th century by Mascheroni (1903) and Fogliata (1908). Some sources state that by 1950, the original Neapolitan horse was deemed extinct, but its lines were incorporated into other breeds, most notably the Lipizzaner. However, a breed called the Napolitano exists in Italy today, and is recognized by the Italian government. According to Gouraud, \\"a dedicated breeder ... is hoping to be able to rebuild it\\". La Repubblica reports that the attempt is based on a single stallion, Neapolitano \\"Il Vecchio\\", which belonged as a foal to Marshal Tito and passed when old to a Serbian farmer, from whom it was purchased and imported to Italy in 1989. The Napoletano as it is known today is one of the 15 indigenous horse \\"breeds of limited distribution\\" currently recognised by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association, under the terms of ministerial decree D.M. 24347 dated 5 November 2003; its status was listed in 2007 as critical by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 2005, a total population of 20 mares and four stallions was registered. Characteristics According to the breed standard, the Napoletano may be bay, black, \\"burnt chestnut\\" or grey, and must stand at least (59 in) at the withers. The head is \\"proud and square\\", the forehead broad, the eyes large, the profile straight becoming convex over the nose, the nostrils flattened, and the ears small. The neck is muscular, long and elegantly curved; the mane is thick and long. The shoulder is deep and well sloped, with high and well-pronounced withers. The croup is broad, rounded, and almost double, and the tail is thick and long, set on medium low. The legs are well-proportioned and very muscular, particularly behind, dry and with pronounced tendons, the joints broad and dry. The action is \\"elegant, pronounced and majestic,\\" the temperament \\"lively, bold and generous.\\" This may be compared with the description of the Neapolitan Horse given in The Sportsman's Dictionary in 1800: History Between the 16th and 19th centuries, Naples and the surrounding regions were known for their high- quality Neapolitan horses. The best horses were bred by nobles for transportation and cavalry. At the beginning of this time, the horses were likely small, coarse, and heavy, suitable for carrying heavily armored warriors. However, as elsewhere, the use of firearms brought on the desire for a more attractive, agile horse. This was achieved through selective breeding, but also through the use of horses from the Near and Middle East. The horses from these arid lands were, if not properly Arabian themselves, at least in type would have been very like Arabians, Barbs, and Akhal-Tekes. Neapolitan breeders, it seems, regularly exchanged stock with those in Andalusia, which would have encouraged the Barb influence. As a result, the Neapolitan horse fit the Baroque horse mold. The head was straight to convex in structure, but dry-featured. The body was deep and broad, but short-backed, with wide round hindquarters and a crested, powerful neck set on high. Neapolitan horses are often mentioned in the history of European horse breeds. A modern breed considered similar to the ancient Neapolitan is one of its descendants, the Lipizzaner. =Timeline= 1508 - Ferdinand of Spain joins the League of Cambrai, which returns Apulia to Spain, along with southern Italy, the port of Brindisi, and Sardinia, where he founds an Andalusian stud at Abbasanta. Several other Andalusian studs follow. Italian horses receive a heavy dose of Spanish blood. 1567 - 1,200 mares are selected for a project by Phillip II of Spain to breed the \\"perfect\\" Spanish horse. They are crossed with Neapolitans, which had been heavily crossed with Andalusians during the time of Ferdinand. 1572 - The first foals of Phillip II‚Äôs project are born and he decides to save these animals for his own use and to present them as gifts to other royals. Highly colored, they are elegant, with an elevated gait, and capable of performing the difficult \\"Airs above the Ground.\\" 1624 - Classical dressage is being taught in Italy. Neapolitan stallions perform the \\"Airs above the Ground\\" between pillars. 1767 - Conversano, a black Neapolitan stallion, is foaled, later to become a foundation sire for the Lipizzan breed. 1790 - Neapolitano, a brown stallion from the Po Region of Italy, is foaled. He is another foundation sire for the Lipizzan breed. 1819 - Maestoso is foaled in Hungary. He is half Spanish, half Neapolitan, and another foundation sire of the Lipizzan breed, 1950 - The Neapolitan is thought to have become extinct. 1989 - The stallion Neapolitano \\"Il Vecchio\\", which belonged as a foal to Marshal Tito is imported to Italy, with the hopes of rebuilding the Napolitano breed. 2003 - The Napoletano is recognised by the AIA under the terms of ministerial decree D.M. 24347 2005 - A total population of 20 mares and four stallions was registered. 2007 - The status of the Napoletano was listed in 2007 as critical by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Uses The Napoletano is suitable for light or medium driving and as a saddle horse, but particularly for dressage and haute √©cole.

Locality page  History  Cloister of the Trinitario convent located in Fuensanta. thumb After a supposed Consecrated virgin's appearance in 1482 that gave rise to the birth of a spring, a small hermitage was based here that belonged to the population of La Roda. Towards 1561 the Trinitaria Order was able to buy the hermitage to build a monastery, after a long conflict with the parish of La Roda. With time the people of the environs began to go to receive baths in the holy spring, and the maiden went away, creating a small village that would give rise to the birth of the municipality. In 1579 it had 20 people. In 1671 the population already had 40 people, due to the segregation of La Roda and its constitution in an independent town after the payment of 337,500 maraved√≠es to the king. The Stem initiated a lawsuit against this decision that ended the confirmation of the segregation of the Fuen Santa in 1672. With the confiscation of the goods of the Church at the beginning of the 19th century, the Monastery of the Trinitarios was abandoned, with time becoming the property of the City council, while its temple will become the local parish, replacing the old one.  Monuments  In the locality of Fuensanta is a parish, the old convent of Trinitarios friars, in whom it venerates Our Lady of the Remedies of Fuensanta. At the moment the temple is formed by two parts, the temple and the cloister. The temple is formed by a rectangular square covered with vaults. The top supports a dome which is adorned with medallions of Trinitarios saints in plaster relief. The entry room of the temple is covered by a dome with pictorial decorations. The outside is of simple construction, of baroque style. The cloister of the temple was constructed in the 16th century, and is composed of an ample space squared with double porticada galleries; arches with columns that maintain the thresholds of corridors. In the old orchards of the convent, a small chapel is conserved with great devotion from the population since it was in the spring where the appearance of the Virgin occurred. Another religious building of the town of Fuensanta is the old parish of San Gregorio Nacianceno, constructed in the 17th century that at the moment is a particular property turned into warehouse. Barroca of the 18th- century style exists in the town in one old compound divided into three distinct houses, in which it emphasizes its Rococo facade and good rejer√≠a. Also a small palace exists of modernist style known as Villa Manolita or the House the Mannas that was reconstructed in 2003 to turn it into a rural shelter.http://www.villamanolita.com/ Rural shelter Villamanolita  Celebrations  * May 9: Day of Saint Gregory of Nazianzus. * The Saturday following San Gregorio: celebration of the Return of the Virgin of the Remedies to La Roda. * Three weeks later: celebration of the return of the Virgin to Fuensanta. * Culture week from August 9 through the 15th. * September 8: Fair of the Virgin of the Remedies.

Up to the end of World War II, he worked in Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timefeev-Resovskij's Abteilung f√ºr Experimentelle Genetik at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Hirnforschung (KWIH, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research). He was taken prisoner by the Russians at the close of World War II. Initially, he worked in Nikolaus Riehl's group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal‚Äô, but at the end of 1947 was sent to work in Sungul' at a sharshka known under the cover name Ob‚Äôekt 0211. At the Sungul' facility, he again worked in biological research department under the direction of Timofeev-Resovskij. When Catsch returned to Germany in the mid-1950s, he fled to the West. He worked at the Biophysikalische Abteilung des Heiligenberg- Instituts and then at the Institut f√ºr Strahlenbiologie am Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe. While in Karlsruhe, he was also appointed, in 1962, to the newly created Lehrstuhl f√ºr Strahlenbiologie, at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe.

The article was received on 5 August 1942. a world-renowned department with the status of an institute. There, Catsch conducted research on the effects of radiation on genetic mutations. What happened to Catsch after the Russians entered Berlin at the close of World War II is best understood in the context of his colleagues Karl Zimmer and Hans-Joachim Born at the KWIH, who had a close professional relationship with Nikolaus Riehl, the scientific director of the Auergesellschaft, in Berlin. At the close of World War II, Russia had special search teams operating in Austria and Germany, especially in Berlin, to identify and ‚Äúrequisition‚Äù equipment, materiel, intellectual property, and personnel useful to the Soviet atomic bomb project. The exploitation teams were under the Russian Alsos, and they were headed by Lavrenij Beria's deputy, Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin. These teams were composed of scientific staff members, in NKVD officer's uniforms, from the bomb project's only laboratory, Laboratory No. 2, in Moscow. In mid-May 1945, the Russian nuclear physicists Georgy Flerov and Lev Artsimovich, in NKVD colonel's uniforms, compelled Zimmer to take them to the location of Riehl and his staff, who had evacuated their Auergesellschaft facilities and were west of Berlin, hoping to be in an area occupied by the American or British military forces. Riehl was detained at the search team's facility in Berlin-Friedrichshagen for a week. This sojourn in Berlin turned into 10 years in the Soviet Union! Riehl and his staff, including their families, were flown to Moscow on 9 July 1945. Riehl was to head up a uranium production group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal‚Äô (–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å‚Äù–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å‚Äù is sometimes transliterated as ‚ÄúElektrostal‚Äù.

Transliterations often also drop the soft sign ‚Äú—å‚Äù.).Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 71-72.Oleynikov, 2000, 7. =In Russia= From 1945 to 1950, Riehl was in charge of uranium production at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'. When Riehl learned that H. J. Born and Karl Zimmer were being held in Krasnogorsk, in the main PoW camp for Germans with scientific degrees, Riehl arranged though Zavenyagin to have them sent to Ehlektrostal‚Äô. Catsch, who had been taken prisoner with Zimmer, was also sent to the Ehlektrostal‚Äô Plant No. 12.Karl G. Zimmer Papers ‚Äì University of Tennessee. At Ehlektrostal‚Äô, Riehl had a hard time incorporating Born, Catsch, and Zimmer into his tasking on uranium production, as Born was a radiochemist, Catsch was a physician and radiation biologist, and Zimmer was a physicist and radiation biologist.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 2, 31, 71, 83, 89-104, 121-128, and 202.Maddrell, 2006, 179-180, 186, 189, and 210-221.Oleynikov, 2000, 11, and 15-16. After the detonation of the Russian uranium bomb, uranium production was going smoothly and Riehl's oversight was no longer necessary at Plant No. 12. Riehl then went, in 1950, to head an institute in Sungul', where he stayed until 1952. Essentially the remaining personnel in his group were assigned elsewhere, with the exception of H. E. Ortmann, A. Baroni (PoW), and Herbert Schmitz (PoW), who went with Riehl. However, Riehl had already sent Born, Catsch, and Zimmer to the institute in December 1947. The institute in Sungul‚Äô was responsible for the handling, treatment, and use of radioactive products generated in reactors, as well as radiation biology, dosimetry, and radiochemistry. The institute was known as Laboratory B, and it was overseen by the 9th Chief Directorate of the NKVD (MVD after 1946), the same organization which oversaw the Russian Alsos operation. The scientific staff of Laboratory B ‚Äì a ShARAShKA ‚Äì was both Soviet and German, the former being mostly political prisoners or exiles, although some of the service staff were criminals.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 121-128, and 202.Oleynikov, 2000, 15-17.

Timofeev-Resovskij, who, as a Soviet citizen, was arrested by the Soviet forces in Berlin at the conclusion of the war, and he was sentenced to 10 years in the Gulag. In 1947, Timofeev- Resovskij was rescued out of a harsh Gulag prison camp, nursed back to health, and sent to Sungul' to complete his sentence, but still make a contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Laboratory B, Timofeev-Resovskij headed a biophysics research department, in which Born, Catsch, and Zimmer were able to conduct work similar to that which they had done in Germany, and all three became section heads in Timofeev-Resovskij's department. In fact, in Sungul', Catsch began his work on developing methods to extract radionucleotides from various organs, which he would continue when he left Russia. In preparation for release from the Soviet Union, it was standard practice to put personnel into quarantine for a few years if they worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project, as was the case for Catsch. Additionally, in 1954, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) and the Soviet Union prepared a list of scientists they wished to keep in the DDR, due to their having worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project; this list was known as the ‚ÄúA-list‚Äù. On this A-list were the names of 18 scientists. Nine, possibly 10, of the names were associated with the Riehl group which worked at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'. Born, Catsch, Riehl, and Zimmer were on the list.The A-list prepared by East Germany and the Soviet Union in 1954 had 18 names on it. These Germans were to be encouraged to stay in East Germany, as they had done work on the Soviet atomic bomb project. At least nine members worked in Riehl‚Äôs group at Ehlektrostal‚Äô: *Hans-Joachim Born, Alexander Catsch, Werner Kirst, Przybilla, Nikolaus Riehl, Herbert Thieme, Tobein, G√ºnter Wirths, and Karl Zimmer. *Schmidt may be a tenth Riehl group member Herbert Schmitz, or the name may refer to Fritz Schmidt, another nuclear scientist who was returned to Germany. Others on the list were: *Heinz Barwich, Justus M√ºhlenpfordt, and Karl-Franz Z√ºhlke, who all worked at Institute G headed by Gustav Hertz, *Ingrid Schilling and Alfred Schimohr, who both worked at Institute A headed by Manfred von Ardenne, *Willi Lange, Gerhard Siewert, and Ludwig Ziehl. See Maddrell, 2006, 179-180. Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 137-139.Maddrell, 2006, 179-180. In Russia, Catsch was given a patronymic and his last name was transliterated from German into Russian; transliterated into English his name became Aleksandr Sergeevich Katsch.Oleynikov, 2000, Reference #154, p. 29. =In Germany again= Catsch returned to the DDR in the mid-1950s and fled West. Riehl arrived in the DDR on 4 April 1955, and by early June he was in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Other colleagues of Riehl who worked with him in Russia also went West; G√ºnter Wirths fled to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and Karl Zimmer went legally.

In 1790 his father and he relocated to Vienna because his parents' house in Tirol burned down. In 1807 he began development of the sewing machine, spending all his savings and leisure time. In 1814 he presented his first sewing machine, which imitated a human hand. Madersperger did not commercialize the 1815 granted privilege which expired after 3 years. By 1823 he was registered in the Himmelpfortgasse 14 as a \\"former\\" middle- class tailor. After several unsuccessful attempts to improve the sewing machine, in 1839 he built a machine imitating the weaving process using the chain stitch. Madersperger was out of money, so he could not set up a factory. He donated the prototype to the Imperial‚Äìroyal Polytechnical Institute (the predecessor of the TU Wien). In 1841 he received a bronze medal from the :de:Nieder√∂sterreichischer Gewerbeverein. Madersperger died on 2 October 1850, staying with his wife for only 3 months in Vienna's almshouse. He is buried in a common grave at the St. Marx Cemetery. Vienna's tailors guild erected a crucifix made of cast iron, and continues to maintain the grave. In his honour, 1933 a memorial was presented to the public in the Resselpark at Karlsplatz. Streets in Vienna, Linz and Innsbruck got his name.

He wrote poetry and prose works. His areas of service was region Baƒçka, that at the time of his birth was a part of Austria-Hungary. After World War I, his city of birth became part of newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  Biography  He attended elementary school in Subotica, while his middle school education (gymnasium) and studium (theology) he had in Kalocsa. After ending the study, he became priest on June 24, 1902. His service as priest began in Baƒçka, southern Austria-Hungary, in 1902, in villages with numerous Croat inhabitants. First, he was the chaplain in Dusnok, where he stayed for few years. There he fought against Nasarenism. In 1904 he's transferred to another village with numerous Croat inhabitants in southern Austria-Hungary, Hercegsz√°nt√≥. There he has remained for three years. After chaplainship in Hercegsz√°nt√≥, the service brought him back to his Subotica, where he was the chaplain until 1911. Later he became the vicar in Subotica, and on that service he remained until his death in 1951. He's the author of the prayer book Duhovna mana. = Political work = He early joined Illyrian movement, (Croatian national revival) along with Baƒçka Croats and Ivan Antunoviƒá. After the death of priest Pajo Kujund≈æiƒá in 1915, another Croat from Baƒçka, Rajiƒá took the lead role among Croat priests in Baƒçka. He has engaged himself intensely to pull Baƒçka into unified South Slavic country. Because of it, he travelled abroad and even participated at a Peace Conference in Paris. After seeing how things have developed after 1918, he has disappointed in his political views. September 22, 1919 he was a participant of the delegation of Bunjevci that went to Paris on conference to talk with foreign diplomats. Rajiƒá said himself, that he went into politics because the circumstances forced him to, all to help his Croat people. Later, he was a leader of Bunjevac-≈†okac Party (Bunjevaƒçko-≈°okaƒçka stranka), and after disagreements with party leadership, he led People's party of Vojvodina (Vojvoƒëanska puƒçka stranka), and later he turned to Croatian leader Stjepan Radiƒá, whose party, HSS, Rajiƒá resiliently supported. During World War II, his activity was interrupted. He was arrested and imprisoned on April 12, 1941. Greater Hungarian circles couldn't forgive him his struggle for separating Baƒçka and merging it to unified South Slavic state. Hungarian extremists have imprisoned him into the caserne of cavalry in Subotica, where they've tortured him. He was pulled out of there thanks to intercession of Croatian episcopate and Dr. Alojzije Stepinac. With the mediation of Vatican, he was interned on May 25, 1941 in Franciscan monastery in Budapest. He returned to his previous service in Subotica in April 1943, and that way remained until its death in 1951. His contemporaries witnessed about him as deep thinker and as a person with firm beliefs and attitudes. He was the editor of the Croatian language-magazine from Subotica, Na≈°e novine, the organ of Land's Christian Socialist Party (Zemaljska kr≈°ƒáansko-socijalna stranka).

There are little remains of the castle on the present day site, just some moats and earthworks. Location The castle was located atop Mount Shigi, on the border of Japan's Kawachi and Yamato Provinces (today Nara prefecture). The shugo (shogunal governors) and later daimy≈ç of Yamato province ruled the province from Shigisan, and wielded some control over the strategic passes between Yamato and Kawachi. The location was also significant for the temple of Ch≈çgosonshi-ji, which sits on the mountainside, some distance below the castle. Shigisan is the central mountain of the Shingon sect of Buddhism, and is claimed to be the location where, in 587, Sh≈çtoku Taishi defeated Mononobe no Moriya in the battle of Shigisan. History The castle was originally constructed in 1536 by Kizawa Nagamasa, who commanded it on behalf of the Hatakeyama clan, who held the post of shugo of Yamato province. It was repaired and expanded on in 1559, by Matsunaga Danjo Hisahide, who commanded it on behalf of the Miyoshi clan. It would grow to be roughly 700m from north to south, and 550m from east to west, and included a four-story yagura (tower or turret). In 1562, however, the daimyo of Yamato province moved to Tamonyama Castle. Shigisan castle fell to members of the Miyoshi clan in 1568, but was recaptured quickly afterwards when the attackers' attention was redirected to the capital by the activities of Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga would then besiege the castle in 1577, destroying it and bringing the downfall of Matsunaga Hisahide.

It is located at the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran. History The Council of Trent in its 23rd session decreed the establishment of diocesan seminaries. The Roman Seminary was established by Pope Pius IV in 1565. Although its administration was entrusted to the Society of Jesus, and the pupils studied at the Collegio Romano, founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1551, these students were intended to serve as diocesan priests in Rome, rather than join the Jesuits.The Roman Seminary. History of an institution of culture and devotion, (Luigi Mezzadri, ed.),Cinisello Balsamo, Sao Paulo, 2001, Over the course of time the Roman Seminary occupied a number of different locations. After the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, direction of the seminary was under the care of secular priests.Benigni, Umberto. \\"Roman Colleges.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 12 January 2016 The residence was changed several times before 1608, when they settled in the Palazzo Borromeo in the Via del Seminario (now 'Collegio Bellarmino', a residence for Jesuit priests, students at the Gregorian University). Each year, at Pentecost, a student delivered a discourse on the Holy Ghost in the papal chapel. In 1773, the seminary was installed in the Collegio Romano of the Jesuits. After the changes in 1798 the number of the students, generally about 100, came down to 9. Pope Pius VII restored the seminary which continued to occupy the Collegio Romano until 1824, when Pope Leo XII returned this building to the Jesuits and transferred the seminary to the Palazzo di Sant'Apollinare, formerly occupied by the Collegio Germanico; the seminary, however, retained its own schools comprising a classical course, and a faculty of philosophy and theology, to which in 1856 a course of canon law was added. The direction of the seminary and, as a rule, the chairs were reserved to the secular clergy. After the departure of the Jesuits in 1848 the seminary again removed to the Collegio Romano. The Roman Seminary included not only young men who had already decided to become priests, but also younger boys still not sure of their vocation, and while the training of the former concentrated on the need for study and the practice of strict piety, the second needed a different formation, with training and pious exercises appropriate to their age. On 29 June 1913, Pope Pius X issued the Apostolic Constitution \\"In pr√¶cipuis\\", promulgating the new regulations concerning the training of the Roman and Italian clergy. The Roman Seminary was divided into major and minor sections. The major seminary merged with the Pontificio Seminario Pio and the Seminario Lombardo dei SS. Ambrogio e Carlo and became the Pontificio Seminario Romano Maggiore (Pontifical Roman Major Seminary), with headquarters in a new building at the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran. The law department was transferred to the Collegio Leoniano, but remained a school of the Seminary. The minor seminary merged with the Vatican Seminary to form the Pontificio Seminario Romano Minore. The Lombardo was merged temporarily with the Roman Seminary from 1913 to 1920, when it was re- established as a separate college. Pontificio Seminario Romano Minore The Collegio Cerasoli with four burses for students of the Diocese of Bergamo endowed by Cardinal Cerasoli, is connected with the seminary. The students take part in the ceremonies in the church of the Seminario Pio. Gregory XV, Clement IX, Innocent XIII, Clement XII, and John XXIII received part of their formation in this seminary. During the Second World War, the Lateran and its related buildings provided a safe haven from the Nazis and Italian Fascists for numbers of Jews and other refugees. Among those who found shelter there were Alcide De Gasperi, Pietro Nenni, Giorgio Del Vecchio, and others. The Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and the sixty orphan refugees they cared for were ordered to leave their convent on the Via Carlo Emanuele. The Sisters of Maria Bambina, who staffed the kitchen at the Pontifical Major Roman Seminary offered a wing of their convent. The grounds also housed Italian soldiers.Marchione, Margherita.

Druce Pelargonium peltatum L. Jan Moninckx (c1656 Leende - buried 20 May 1714 Amsterdam), was a Dutch botanical artist and painter, best known for the colour plates he and his daughter, Maria Moninckx, created and which make up the nine-volume Moninckx Atlas. This was published in the period 1686-1709 and depicted 420 plants from the Hortus Medicus of Amsterdam. Hortus Medicus In 1682 Joan Huydecoper and Jan Commelin took the initiative in establishing a new Hortus Medicus in Amsterdam. It differed from the herb garden at the Binnengasthuis insofar as it also grew ornamental plants and would function as a Hortus Botanicus. Huydecoper was mayor of Amsterdam and had great influence with the Dutch East India Company, while Commelin was a merchant in herbs and pharmaceuticals. Both men were well known as enthusiastic and knowledgeable gardeners. Because of their contacts in the businessworld and their practical horticultural experience, they received a constant stream of plants, seeds, bulbs and cuttings to be cultivated far from their place of origin. This led to the creation of one of the richest plant collections in Europe. Plants of commercial value, also potherbs, edible crop plants and medicinal plants, were propagated in the garden for planting elsewhere. An example of this was the coffee plant, which oddly, was not illustrated in the Moninckx Atlas, but became the backbone of the Brazilian coffee industry. In addition many ornamental plants, especially strange and exotic specimens, were cultivated. These plants were grown for their interest, curiosity value and often for further research. Moninckx Atlas Between 1686 and 1709, Huydecoper and Commelin commissioned 420 large parchment aquarels of plants growing in the Amsterdam garden. The garden did not have a herbarium, and a pictorial record in the form of paintings, would create something of permanent value. Four very accomplished artists were employed to tackle this extensive project. The lion's share of work was done by Jan Moninckx: 273 sheets bear his signature. Maria Moninckx, his daughter, produced 101 paintings. The other artists were Alida Withoos (13 aquarels) and Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff (daughter of Maria Sibylla Merian) with 2 sheets; 31 aquarels were unsigned. The heraldic arms of Huydecoper and Commelin, painted by Jan Moninckx, were used to decorate volume 1 of the Atlas. In 1749 there was an attempt to expand the collection. This 9th volume consisted of a mere five aquarels, one by Dorothea Storm-Kreps and four by Jan Matthias Cock. The illustrated plants in the first five volumes and part of the sixth, had their names printed in both Latin and Dutch. The Latin names in bold Roman type, and the Dutch names in elegant Gothic calligraphy. This monumental work is still of great taxonomic, historic, and artistic interest. The aquarels have served as the basis for engravings in the Horti Medici Amstelodamensis rariorum plantarum historia, part 1, by Jan Commelin, appearing in 1697 and part 2, by his cousin Caspar Commelin, in 1701. The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus based the taxonomy for his Species plantarum of 1753 on no fewer than 259 species from the Moninckx Atlas. A recent scanning of the complete work has made the plates and text available on the University of Amsterdam website. Moninckx family The Moninckx family had a long tradition of painting and were researched in a book titled De Schildersfamilie Moninckx, published by Abraham Bredius in 1889. Well-known was Gijsbert Moninckx, a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in The Hague in 1605. Jan's parents were Johannes Moninckx, a clergyman at Leende, Noord- Brabant, and his wife, Maria Jan van Duysel. On 23 May 1682 Jan signed a betrothal register in Amsterdam, stating his intention to marry Anna Geestevelt. Anna was 23 years old and both lived at Het Singel in Amsterdam. In 1686 Jan was lieutenant in a military guard. In 1698 Jan signed a notarial document authorising the sale of a house at Voorburg that had belonged to his deceased father-in-law. At that time he lived in Leydsedwarsstraat in Amsterdam and was married to Adriaentje Uchtenbroeck, whose father had been Pieter Jans Uchtenbroeck. Jan was buried on 20 May 1714 and had died at his house in Noorderdwarsstraat near the Prinsengracht. Adriaentje was buried on 27 January 1722.

Pembroke is the location of the administrative headquarters of Renfrew County, though the city itself is politically independent. It is northwest of Ottawa. History The first European settler to the area now known as Pembroke was Daniel Fraser in 1823, who squatted on land that was discovered to have been granted to a man named Abel Ward. Ward later sold the land (where Moncion's Metro Supermarket is located) to Fraser, and nearby Fraser Street is named after the family. Peter White, a veteran of the Royal Navy arrived in 1828, squatting beside Fraser on the land where Dairy Queen is now located. Other settlers followed, attracted by the growing lumbering operations of the area. Originally named Miramichi, The hamlet was later renamed Moffat, and then Sydenham. In 1856, it merged with the hamlet of Campelltown, across the Muskrat River, to form the Police Village of Pembroke. Pembroke became a police village in 1856. Map of the Village of Pembroke, 1853 Map of the Town of Pembroke, 1880 Pembroke is indirectly named after Sidney Herbert, First Admiralty Secretary from 1841 to 1845 and son of George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke. Pembroke was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1971. It was named seat for Renfrew County in 1861. This set the stage for construction shortly thereafter on the Renfrew County Courthouse, which was finished in 1867, and the arrival of many civil servants, much wealth and much construction. In the 20-year period following 1861, Pembroke basically became the city it is today in terms of layout and buildings, although many homes and other structures have been lost to time. A fire in 1918 destroyed much of Pembroke's downtown. From 2005 to 2007, the courthouse and (now disused) jail were re-constructed into one building and historic renovations were also completed. Visitors on weekdays can view original 1867 jail cells in the basement, and the original courtroom, complete with a huge replica of the original brass light fixture. County meetings were held here for many years. Three hangings occurred at the indoor gallows inside the Courthouse, two in the 1870s and one in 1952. Other historic buildings that survive in Pembroke include a historic synagogue, two original hospitals, the Dunlop mansion (Grey Gables Manor Bed & Breakfast), the 'Munroe Block' downtown, and two houses belonging to the White family. A fire in 1918 downtown destroyed many buildings, including the Pembroke Opera House.Pembroke's great fire of 1918: 'A sorry sight'  Editorial  Opinion  Pembroke Daily Observer. Thedailyobserver.ca. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. In 1898 Pembroke became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pembroke. Economy Pembroke's public library Pembroke is the largest commercial centre between North Bay and Ottawa. Victoria Hall on 42 Renfrew Street Historically, forestry and farming formed the backbone of the local economy and remain important today. Local timber products include lumber, plywood, veneer, hydro poles and fibreboard. Other local manufacturing operations produce office furniture. CFB Petawawa in nearby Petawawa and Chalk River Laboratories of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited in Chalk River are also regional employers. Chalk River Laboratories is being restructured to a GOCO (Government Owned, Contractor Operated) Laboratory. The economy also benefits from tourism, aided partly by Pembroke's location on the Trans-Canada Highway. Pembroke is a gateway to natural adventures on the Petawawa and Ottawa Rivers, Algonquin Park and to world-class white water rafting a short distance to the southwest. Attractions Champlain Trail Pioneer Village Local attractions include 30 historic murals in the downtown area depicting the history of the city, from steam engines to logging. Pembroke has more murals than almost any city in Canada. At the Champlain Trail Pioneer Village and Museum the history of Ottawa Valley settlers comes alive inside the fully furnished schoolhouse, pioneer log home and church ‚Äî all built in the 1800s. Other outdoor exhibits include train station, sawmill, blacksmith shop, stonelifter, carriage shed, woodworking shop, bake oven, smokehouse and a 1923 Bickle fire engine. The large museum features artifacts which range from fossils and Native Canadian arrowheads to furniture, clothing and manufactured products of Pembroke from various eras. There is also a replica of Samuel de Champlain's Astrolabe (he brought the original to the Valley in 1613), an original Cockburn pointer boat, Corliss steam engine, doctor's examination room, fancy parlour rooms, general store, hair salon and more. The Pembroke Hydro Museum commemorates national hydro-electric development in Pembroke, including the first electric streetlights in Pembroke, and the first municipal building with electric lights (Victoria Hall). The city is home to an annual Old Time Fiddling and Step Dancing Festival, which happens Labour Day weekend at Riverside Park. There are often up to 1400 RVs parked there for the week preceding the event. Award-winning fiddler/step dancer April Verch is a Pembroke native. Pembroke has a 600 plus seat community arts facility, Festival Hall Center of the Arts. The facility is operated by a Consortium consisting of The City of Pembroke and the Townships of Petawawa and Laurentian Valley. This facility hosts various local productions and top Canadian artists during the year. Pembroke also is host to the annual Silver Stick Regional Minor League Hockey Tournament, which brings in several hundred children and youth on weekends in November and early December for regional qualifying games. Pembroke's Public Library was designed by architect Francis Conroy Sullivan, a contemporary of Frank Lloyd Wright. Sports Pembroke has been the home of the Pembroke Lumber Kings Junior A Hockey Club since 1958. They have been members of the Central Canada Hockey League since 1964, with the exception of the 1979‚Äì1980 season when the Pembroke Royals replaced them.

Pembroke annually hosts the Kings Sports Tournament, in August. DemographicsEducation The war memorial in downtown Pembroke. The city of Pembroke has three Anglophone Catholic primary schools; Cathedral Catholic School, Holy Name Catholic School and Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School. There are also three public primary schools; Highview Public School, Rockwood Public School and Champlain Discovery Public School. The two biggest secondary schools are Bishop Smith Catholic School, which is the only secondary Catholic school in Pembroke and Petawawa, the neighboring town, and Fellowes High School, the only public Anglophone High School. There are two French schools for the French population of the city; √âcole √©l√©mentaire et secondaire catholique Jeanne-Lajoie, which is the French catholic school, and √âcole √©l√©mentaire et secondaire publique l‚Äô√âquinoxe, which is a smaller French Public School. All the Pembroke high schools are a part of the ‚ÄòUpper Ottawa Valley High School Athletic Association (UOVHSAA). UOVHSAA includes 11 high schools in the Renfrew County. The association encourages the ‚Äúpromotion and enhancement of the educational value of school sport‚Äù. Although not all schools are able to participate in every sport due to different levels of interest or number of interested students, they students can participate in rugby, volleyball, cross country, football, basketball, alpine skiing, hockey, cross country skiing, snowboarding, curling, wrestling, badminton, golf, soccer, tennis and track and field. The possibilities for students are endless and participation can lead to competing in different associations to represent not only the school, but also the city itself. The Ottawa-based Algonquin College also has a campus in the heart of Pembroke, right by the Ottawa River. The campus doesn't offer as many programs as the Ottawa campus, but it offers some unique programs that wouldn't be available in the big city. The Outdoor Adventure and Outdoor Adventure Naturalist, Forestry Technician, and Environmental Technician programs are unique to Pembroke due to its location by the water and Algonquin Provincial Park. Healthcare services The Pembroke Regional Hospital is the city's only hospital with many different services available. It is an acute care hospital with services such as medicine, surgery, maternal and childcare, mental health care, regional rehabilitation, emergency and intensive care. The hospital is affiliated with the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Medicine and recognized as a state of the art teaching hospital. Aside from the hospital's doctors, many other doctors practice independently. There is also the Integrated Health Centre, with its focus on assisting the public to improve their health and to prevent pain and illness before problems occur. Mental health care in Pembroke is available throughout different locations. The Mental Health Services of Renfrew County is the mental health ward in the Pembroke Regional Hospital. For youth, there is the Phoenix Centre for Children and Families that is run by a volunteer board of directors and funded by the provincial government. The Phoenix Centre for Children and Families offers walk-in counselling for those who need immediate help or advice. There is also the Robbie Dean Family Counselling Centre, that offers a wide variety of services such as a Suicide Prevention & Crisis Clinic, PTSD/OSI Peer Support Group, a Youth Of Parents who Experience Occupational Trauma Program, Support Group for LGBTQ Youth, and a Parent Peer Support Group. They also hold many community events to help support mental health initiatives.

The headquarters for the district were housed in the town. It was the central location for 15 fire tower lookouts, including the towers in Algonquin Park. The 15 towers included: Wilberforce, Mt. Edna, Sherwood, Murchison, Preston, Clancy, Fitzgerald, Brent, Big Crow Lake, White Trout Lake, Stonecliffe, Deux Rivi√®res, Osler, Lauder and Skymount. When a fire was spotted in the forest a towerman would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. These towers would all be phased out after aerial fire fighting techniques were employed in the 1970s.

Preston Tucker was from Ypsilanti and did his engineering work a couple of blocks from the museum. The museum is an official site of the MotorCities National Heritage Area, which is \\"dedicated to preserving, interpreting and promoting the automotive and labor heritage of the State of Michigan.\\" Miller Motors In 1916, Joseph H. Thompson opened a Dodge dealership, possibly the first outside Detroit, in the north end of the Thompson Block. Soon after, Thompson moved his dealership across Cross Street, to the site of the museum. In 1927, Carl Miller opened a Hudson Sales and Service franchise on the site, and in 1955 the dealership was renamed Miller Motors, reflecting expanded product offerings. From 1927 until the Hudson Motor Car Company merged with the Nash- Kelvinator Corporation on May 1, 1954 to form American Motors Corporation, the dealership sold 1,969 new cars, and has retained and preserved all dealership records since opening. For about 20 years, Miller Motors continued as a used car and parts dealer specializing in Hudsons and Hudson parts. Before Miller Motors was bought and included as a feature of the museum, Miller Motors was \\"the place to go when [Hudson owners] needed clutch oil or touch-up paint, or wanted to buy or sell a Hudson.\\" Retired Museum Curator Jack Miller is known as an authority on restoring Hudson cars and the history of Hudson cars.

Abduction, murder, and island-wide manhunt=Abduction= Pai Hsiao-yen disappeared after leaving for her school, Hsing Wu High School, on the morning of April 14, 1997. Her family received a ransom note of along with a severed piece of her little finger and a photograph of a bound girl. Press in Taiwan first reported the incident on April 23, 1997, which contradicted the accepted practice of reporting the kidnapping after its resolution. Some of the pre-planned ransom drops were aborted when kidnappers spotted police and media tailing Pai Bing-bing. However, after the abductors negotiated with the police for 11 days and changed the locations of payment more than 20 times, the police finally decoded the communication methods used by the abductors. In the subsequent police raid, one suspect was arrested while two others escaped after an intense gun fight with the police. =Murder= Pai Hsiao-yen's mutilated body, weighted down with dumbbells, was found in a drainage ditch on April 28, 1997. Investigators said that she had been dead for ten days before her body's discovery. Ransom negotiations had continued after the likely time of Pai's death; an impersonator placed a telephone call to give Pai Bing-bing the impression that her daughter was alive. Tim Healy and Laurie Underwood of Asiaweek said that Pai was \\"apparently tortured\\" before her death. The photograph of her naked dead body was leaked to the mass media, including the China Times, which printed it. Twelve accessories were arrested, but three of the main criminals, (), Lin Chun-sheng (), and Kao Tien-meen () escaped. A fourth person, Chang Chih-huei (, Chen's brother-in- law) was suspected of involvement, but his sentence was eventually overturned due to insufficient evidence. An island-wide manhunt began and the police were ordered to fatally shoot and kill the suspects without warning if they showed any sign of resistance. =Island-wide manhunt= While being pursued, the trio abducted Taipei County councilor Tsai Ming-tang in June 1997 and a businessman surnamed Chen in August 1997. On August 19, the trio was spotted by two foot patrol police officers on Wuchang Street (‰∫îÂ∏∏Ë°ó) in Taipei's Zhongshan District. A brief exchange of fire ensued and Lin turned the gun on himself after he was shot six times; one of the officers was killed and the other one was wounded. Lin died around 11:55 AM. Reinforcement was immediately rushed to the neighborhood, and more than 800 officers conducted a thorough search, which turned up nothing. On October 23, Kao and Chen shot and killed a plastic surgeon, his wife, and a nurse after forcing them to perform plastic surgery on them. Kao and Chen eluded a massive police search in early November 1997. A few days later, Kao was spotted by the police and shot himself when police attempted to arrest him on November 17. The last criminal, Chen Chin- hsing, broke into the residence of Colonel Edward McGill Alexander, South African military attach√© to Taipei, and took the family hostage on November 18, but eventually surrendered to the police after negotiation initiated by politician Frank Hsieh. After being granted media access, Chen confessed to the April kidnapping and other crimes. Chen was executed on October 6, 1999, after being convicted in December 1998 for kidnappings, murders, and multiple counts of sexual assaults. Protests and resignations Demonstrators marched on and , demanding Premier Lien Chan's resignation, partially over the rise in violent crime as evidenced by the then-unsolved murders of Pai, Peng Wan- ru, and Liu Pang-yu. Eight media organizations, including the China Times, which ran the photograph of Pai's body, were condemned during the first protest. President Lee Teng-hui offered an apology on , stating Lien would be relieved of his duty as premier and the Cabinet would be reshuffled. Ma Ying- jeou, who was serving as Minister without Portfolio, resigned following the first protest. Lin Fong-cheng, who was serving as Minister of the Interior, also resigned his post following the first protest. Lien Chan resigned his post as Premier on , as did the director-general of the National Police Agency, Yao Kao-chiao. Lien had repeatedly offered to resign from his other office as Vice President in the wake of the protests; eventually he retained this office until the term ended.

She was laid down in May 1901, launched in May 1903, and commissioned in November 1904, though an accident during sea trials delayed her completion until May 1905. She was named for the German province of Elsass, now the French region of Alsace. Her sister ships were , , and . The ship was armed with a battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Like all other pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, Elsass was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, her career as a frontline battleship was cut short. The ship served in II Squadron of the German fleet after commissioning, and during this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training, as well as making good-will visits to foreign countries. Surpassed by new dreadnought battleships, Elsass was decommissioned in 1913, though she was reactivated a year later following the outbreak of World War I and assigned to VI Battle Squadron. Elsass saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy. In August 1915, she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, during which she engaged the Russian battleship . In 1916, she was placed in reserve because of crew shortages and the threat of British submarines operating in the Baltic, and she spent the remainder of the war as a training ship. She was retained after the war under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and was modernized in 1923‚Äì1924. Elsass served in the Reichsmarine with the surface fleet until 1930, conducting training operations and visits to foreign ports as she had earlier in her career. In 1930, she was again placed in reserve, and the following year she was stricken from the naval register. Elsass was used for a short time as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven. The outdated battleship was sold to Norddeutscher Lloyd in late 1935 and was broken up for scrap the following year.  Design  Line-drawing of the Braunschweig class With the passage of the Second Naval Law under the direction of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships, to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, Krupp, the supplier of naval artillery to the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) had developed quick-firing, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the Wittelsbachs. The Design Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from torpedo boats as torpedoes became more effective. Though the Braunschweig class marked a significant improvement over earlier German battleships, its design fell victim to the rapid pace of technological development in the early 1900s. The British battleship ‚Äîarmed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns‚Äîwas commissioned in December 1906, just a year after Elsass entered service. Dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including Elsass. Elsass was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and at Full load. Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers, and all of which burned coal. Elsasss powerplant was rated at , which generated a designed top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of . Elsasss armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament was composed of fourteen 17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns and eighteen 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns. Her armament was further increased by six torpedo tubes, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each broadside, and the final tube was in the stern. Elsass was protected with Krupp armor. Her armored belt was thick, with the heavier armor in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her deck was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.  Service history  Elsass on the slipway before her launch Elsass was laid down on 26 May 1901 at the Schichau-Werke in Danzig under construction number 97. The second unit of her class, she was ordered under the contract name \\"J\\" as a new unit for the fleet. Elsass was launched on 26 May 1903, and the launching ceremony was attended by Hermann zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Reichsstatthalter (Governor) of the ship's namesake province. The ship was transferred to Kiel on 26 October 1904 by a shipyard crew. She was commissioned into the fleet on 29 November 1904 and began sea trials thereafter. These were interrupted on 15 December, when the ship's rudder broke, forcing her to return for repairs that lasted until February 1905. Elsass then returned to trials, which were completed by May. She thereafter joined II Squadron, replacing the old coastal defense ship . Her first commander was then-Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Hugo von Pohl, who remained in the position until September 1905. For the next several years, Elsass and the rest of the fleet were occupied with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May and a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May 1905, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinem√ºnde. KzS Gustav Bachmann took command of the ship in September. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic. Tea dispensing on the ship lying in front of Travem√ºnde (1908) On 28 April 1908, a significant accident occurred aboard Elsass, when a round of ammunition exploded. Three men were killed and another six were wounded. In 1908 and 1909, the fleet, which had been renamed the High Seas Fleet, undertook major cruises into the Atlantic Ocean. During the first, which began on 13 July 1908, Elsass stopped in Las Palmas from 23 July to 1 August before returning to Germany on 13 August for the autumn maneuvers. The 1909 cruise began on 7 July and lasted until 1 August, and included a visit to El Ferrol, Spain from 18 to 25 July. In September, KzS Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz replaced Scheer as the ship's commander. The year 1910 followed the same pattern of individual, squadron, and fleet training as in previous years. For the summer cruises of 1910 and 1911, the German fleet went to Norwegian waters; both years also saw winter cruises in the western Baltic. On 14 December 1910, while conducting individual training, Elsass collided with the battleship , though neither ship was seriously damaged. KzS Carl Schaumann took command of the ship in September 1911, though he remained in command for just a month, being replaced by KzS Hugo Langemak in October. Elsass was transferred to I Squadron on 3 October, trading places with the battleship . On 23 March 1912, during fleet training, Elsass accidentally collided with a Swedish steamship‚Äî‚Äîin heavy fog in the western entrance to the Skagerrak. Pollux was badly damaged in the accident and sank, though Elsass was able to take off her crew. In April, Elsass served as a target ship during gunfire training with the armored cruiser in a demonstration held off the Faroe Islands. On the 29th of the month, the new dreadnought battleship replaced Elsass in I Squadron, and the latter had her crew reduced. On 24 August, the ship received her full complement again, to allow Elsass to take part in the annual maneuvers with the newly formed III Squadron. She also came under the temporary command of KzS Leberecht Maass. After the exercises, the squadron was dissolved, and on 29 September Elsass again had her crew reduced. She returned to active duty on 1 December, when she was assigned to V Division of III Squadron, along with her sister ship and the new dreadnought . The ships began the year with individual training, followed by divisional exercises in the Baltic later in January 1913. In early March, fleet exercises were held in the North Sea. Elsass was sent to Kiel on 17 March to begin preparations for her decommissioning, as her place in the division was taken by the new dreadnought . On 13 May, Elsass was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea. Effective 15 October, she was assigned to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea). =World War I= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 On 28 July 1914, Germany's ally Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, beginning World War I. Three days later, Elsass was reactivated as the European powers moved toward war, and she was assigned to IV Battle Squadron. The unit also included her sister ship Braunschweig and the five Wittelsbach-class battleships, and was commanded by Vizeadmiral Ehrhard Schmidt. Elsass began individual and then squadron training, which lasted until early September. The training exercises were interrupted on 26 August, when the squadron and the armored cruisers and and the light cruiser were sent to rescue the stranded light cruiser , which had run aground off the island of Odensholm in the eastern Baltic. By 28 August, however, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy Magdeburg before the relief force had arrived. As a result, Braunschweig and the rest of the squadron returned to Bornholm that day. Starting on 2 September, IV Squadron, assisted by Bl√ºcher, conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. From 11 to 20 September, Elsass and the rest of the division was transferred to the mouth of the Elbe to provide local defense against possible British attacks. Later that month, the IV Squadron ships were transferred back to the Baltic. The army had requested that the navy make a demonstration to keep Russian reserves along the Baltic coast, instead of allowing the Russians to re-deploy them to Galicia. The older battleships of the V Battle Squadron were sent to Danzig to embark ground forces, while Braunschweig and IV Squadron steamed in advance. The operation was called off early, however, after British submarines were reportedly sighted in the Baltic. The two squadrons rendezvoused off Bornholm before proceeded on to Kiel, arriving on 26 September. Elsass returned to the Elbe from 5 December to 1 March 1915, with scheduled periodic maintenance from 24 to 28 February. After guard ship duties in the Elbe ended, she was briefly transferred to the Schillig Roads, outside Wilhelmshaven, from 1 to 9 March. Beginning on 2 April, Elsass began training exercises in the Baltic, followed by another shipyard period from 26 April to 16 May at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel. She returned to provide coastal defense in the Elbe on 27 May. On 4 July 1915, following the loss of the minelaying cruiser in the Baltic, the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area. Additionally, the army requested naval support for the Army of the Niemen, which was operating in Courland. On 7‚Äì11 and 18‚Äì19 July, German cruisers, with the IV Squadron ships in support, conducted sweeps in the Baltic, though without engaging any Russian forces. During the latter operation, Elsass collided with the torpedo boat , though she inflicted only minor damage. In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces to assist the German Army then advancing on the city. IV Squadron was joined by I Squadron, which consisted of the eight and s, from the High Seas Fleet, as well as three battlecruisers and many smaller craft. The task force was commanded by Vizeadmiral Franz von Hipper, though operational command remained with Schmidt. On the morning of 8 August, the German fleet made its initial push into the Gulf. Elsass and Braunschweig were assigned to attack the Russian pre-dreadnought to prevent her from disrupting the German minesweepers. The German vessels engaged Slava and the gunboat at long range without result. When it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall, Schmidt called off the attempt. A second attempt was made on 16 August. Elsass remained outside the Gulf, while the dreadnoughts and dealt with Slava. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. However, reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the German fleet to call off the operation the following day. After the operation, Elsass remained in Libau, and IV Squadron was disbanded on 18 December. While in Libau, Elsass briefly served as the command ship for Vizeadmiral Friedrich Schultz, the Befehlshaber der Aufkl√§rungsschiffe der Ostsee (Commander of Reconnaissance Forces in the Baltic), from January to March 1916. By that time, Braunschweig, which had been modified in Kiel to serve as Schultz's command ship, arrived to relieve Elsass. Crew shortages forced the navy to reduce both ships' crews, to the point that they were only capable of providing local defense of the harbor. On 10 July, Elsass was transferred back to Kiel, where four days later her crew was transferred to her sister . Elsass was taken into the shipyard in Kiel for repairs before returning to service on 25 July as a stationary training ship assigned to I Marine Inspectorate. She remained in Kiel until her decommissioning on 20 June 1918. The ship underwent an overhaul and returned to training duty in October, though Germany surrendered the following month. =Postwar career= Elsass in Kiel in 1926 The Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the older \\"Deutschland or Lothringen class.\\" Elsass was kept and used as a training ship in the German fleet, which was renamed the Reichsmarine. In 1923, the aging ship underwent a major overhaul. Elsass was dry-docked in the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven, where the conning tower was rebuilt. Work was completed the following year. She was recommissioned on 15 February 1924 with a partial crew. Assigned to the Linienschiffsdivision (Battleship Division) of the Seestreitkr√§fte der Nordsee (Naval Forces of the North Sea) and based in Wilhelmshaven, the ship received her full crew by 1 April. In July, she joined the rest of the fleet for a major training cruise in the Atlantic, which included a stop in Vigo, Spain, from 6 to 13 July. In 1925, Elsass and the battleship visited Oslo, Norway, from 19 to 24 June, though Elsass proceeded alone to Odda, where she stayed from 26 to 30 June. On 1 October, the ship was transferred to the Seestreitkr√§fte der Ostsee (Naval Forces of the Baltic Sea), which was based in Kiel. The fleet went on another major cruise in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea in May and June 1926; during the trip Elsass made calls in several Spanish ports, including Mah√≥n, Barcelona, and Vigo. Another cruise followed the next year in April and May, with stops in Vilagarc√≠a, Spain, S√£o Vicente, Madeira, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Santa Cruz de La Palma in the Canary Islands, Horta and Ponta Delgada in the Azores, and Lisbon, Portugal. In 1928, Elsass made visits to Ulvik and Bergen in Norway in July, and Skagen, Denmark, in September. The winter of 1928‚Äì1929 proved to be especially cold, and Elsass and the battleship were pressed into service as icebreakers; the two ships helped to free 65 merchant ships from the heavy ice. In March 1929, Elsass also performed icebreaking duties off Gedser, Denmark. The fleet went on another Atlantic cruise in April 1929, and Elsass made calls in Villagarcia and A Pobra do Carami√±al, Spain. That fall, the ship visited Karlskrona, Sweden. Elsass was withdrawn from active service on 25 February 1930. She was stricken from the naval register on 31 March 1931 and served as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven until 31 October 1935, when the Reichsmarine sold her to Technischer Betrieb des Norddeutscher Lloyd. Elsass was broken up for scrap the following year.

He was born at Saint-Quentin, Aisne, France. He studied literature at the Coll√®ge des Bons-Enfants in his native town and then entered the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. Here he distinguished himself, taking the first prize in physics. In 1835 he entered the science section of the Ecole Normale where his brother Edouard had preceded him. He made the acquaintance there of La Provostaye who was at the time a surveillant and who became his lifelong friend and his associate in his researches. After completing his course, he accepted a professorship in 1839 at Caen, and in 1841 returned to Paris where he received similar appointments, first at the Lyc√©e St-Louis and later at the Lyc√©e Condorcet, where he succeeded La Provostaye who was forced to retire on account of ill-health. His growing reputation won for him in 1853 the chair of physics at the Sorbonne which he held for thirty-two years. Between 1858 and 1861 he made many observations in connexion with terrestrial magnetism. His most important contributions to physics, however, were his researches on radiant heat made in conjunction with La Provostaye. The two physicists concluded that radiant heat, like light, was a disturbance set up in what was then called the ether and propagated in all directions by transverse waves. They showed in a series of \\"M√©moires\\" published in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique that it manifests the characteristic phenomena of reflection, refraction, and polarization, as well as of emission and absorption. They also made a study of the latent heat of fusion of ice, and a careful investigation of the range of applicability of the Dulong-Petit law representing the law of cooling. He also worked in connexion with the establishment and development of laboratory instruction in physics. When the Ecole pratique des hautes √©tudes was founded in 1869 he was commissioned to organize the physical laboratory. During the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì1871), he succeeded after many difficulties in establishing electrical communication with d'Alm√©ida who was outside the lines.ATTEMPT TO TRANSMIT ELECTRICITY; THROUGH RIVERS, New York Times, March 13, 1881 The exposure he underwent brought on rheumatism which greatly weakened his constitution.

The valley is in the North York Moors National Park, some north of Kirkbymoorside, the nearest town. Pickering is some to the south-east and Helmsley to the south-west. The combined population of the civil parishes of Farndale East and Farndale West was 207 in 2011, and was estimated to have dropped to 180 by 2015. The two parishes were combined in 2018 to form Farndale parish. Farndale is an isolated, scattered agricultural community with traditional Yorkshire dry stone walls. The valley is popular with walkers due to its famous wild daffodils, which can be seen around Easter time all along the banks of the River Dove. To protect the daffodils the majority of Farndale north of Lowna was created a Local Nature Reserve in 1955. Farndale is home to two hamlets; Church Houses at the top of the valley and Low Mill further down. Low Mill is a tourist honeypot during daffodil season as this is where the famous daffodil walk begins. The other end of the daffodil walk is at High Mill a cluster of houses a short distance down a lane from Church Houses. The annual Farndale Agricultural Show which is held on the Summer Bank Holiday Monday in late August is a popular local event. The 100th Show was held in 2006. Etymology Sources disagree on the origin of the name Farndale, although it is a combination of two parts \\"Farn\\" and \\"Dale\\". There a four possible origins for \\"Farn\\" all of which do describe the dale. It may be derived from the Celtic \\"Faren\\" meaning beautiful; alternatively it could be derived from the Scandinavian \\"F√¶N\\" meaning sheep or possibly from Old English \\"Fearn\\" meaning fern or ferny place or from the Gaelic \\"Fe√†rna\\" which means alder tree of which there are many in Farndale. While Dale probably means Valley either derived from Scandinavion \\"Dalr\\" or Anglian \\"D√¶l\\" although it could be derived from the Gaelic \\"Dail\\" meaning level field by a river. The name of the River Dove which flows through Farndale is almost definitely from either the Old British \\"Dubo\\" meaning Black or from the Gaelic \\"Dubh\\" also meaning black, hence Black (or Dark) River. Geography Farndale is a valley within the North York Moors, it is surrounded by some of the wildest moorland in England. The dale is sandwiched between Bransdale to the west, Rosedale to the east and Westerdale to the north. To the north-east sits Blakey Ridge at over above sea level, and to the north-west, Cockayne Ridge reaching up to above sea level is one of the highest points of the North York Moors. The southern boundary of the Farndale Parishes are along Harland Beck and Shortsha Beck (across Lowna Lund), although the Gillamoor to Hutton-le-Hole road is considered as the boundary for all other purposes, south of this the dale continues but changes its name to Douthwaitedale, though the Tabular Hills until it reaches Keldhome then Kirkby Mills just east of Kirkbymoorside. The River Dove rises on Westerdale Moor North of Farndale, then flows through Farndale south-east past to Church Houses. Here it turns south and continues meandering past Low Mill to Lowna. At Gillamoor it heads south-east again past Hutton-le-Hole before returning southwards past Ravenswick and to the east of Kirkbymoorside. It continues past Keldholme and Kikrby Mills to Great Edstone. From there it flows south-south-east to where it joins the River Rye in the Vale of Pickering near the village of Salton. Several tributaries meet the Dove through Farndale two of these make the valley is almost 'cactus' shaped, with a long central valley following the River Dove, and two side branches to make the arms - Blakey Gill near Church Houses and West Gill near Low Mill. Local Nature Reserve left The Farndale Local Nature Reserve constitutes the majority of Farndale, which is a dale within the North York Moors National Park. It was created in 1955 to protect the wild daffodils (narcissus pseudonarcissus), for which the dale is famed. The Local Nature reserve comprises the larger part of the Farndale Site of Special Scientific Interest which comprises . Over 40,000 people visit the dale in the springtime to walk along the River Dove and see the daffodils. The variety of daffodil that grows wild in the valley, has shorter stems than the cultivated variety and are believed to have been planted by monks in medieval times. The daffodils are also known as Lent Lillies in Farndale and they usually appear around Lent. Long Distance Foot Paths Around the north of Farndale, between Bloworth Crossing and Blakey is the track bed of the old Rosedale Ironstone Railway (Rosedale Branch) which forms part of three Long Distance Footpaths these being Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk, The Lyke Wake Walk and the Esk Valley Walk. Governance Farndale was historically divided between three ancient parishes. Farndale Eastside was a township in the parish of Lastingham. The township of Farndale High Quarter and Bransdale Eastside (also known as Farndale Westside) and the township of Farndale Low Quarter (also known as Low Farndale) were in the parish of Kirkbymoorside. In 1873 Farndale Hiqh Quarter and Farndale Westside joined to become a single parish. The Farndale parishes were subsequently realigned to Farndale East and Farndale West.Vision of Britain website The dividing line between the two Farndale civil parishes is along the course of the River Dove. Until 2018 Farndale East had a Parish Council responsible for the eastern side including Church Houses and Farndale West had a Parish Meeting looking after the western side including Low Mill. In April 2018 a joint Farndale Parish Council was formed under a grouping order and it now represents the interests of all residents in Farndale. The second tier of Local Government is Ryedale District Council and the third tier North Yorkshire County Council, historically being part of the North Riding of Yorkshire. Farndale is part of the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency and the Yorkshire and Humber European Parliamentary constituency. In popular culture Farndale has been used as a location for a number of film and TV locations including: Film The 2020 Film adaption of The Secret Garden includes Moorland scenes filmed around Farndale. The 1975 Film, All Creatures Great and Small starring Simon Ward and Anthony Hopkins, included locations in Farndale. Television BBC Documentary: A Wild Year, The North York Moors was partly filmed in and around Farndale, and featured the wild daffodils. Bad Move, an ITV sitcom written by Jack Dee and Pete Sinclair and starring Jack Dee was partly filmed in Farndale. The location of Rawlings' new home is near Low Mill. Accidental Farmer, a pilot for BBC TV starring Ashley Jensen was partly filmed in Farndale, June / July 2010. BBC Inside Out covered Heavy Snow in Farndale in November 2010.

It was first described as a distinct species by Trevor H. Worthy in 2005. The New Zealand stiff-tailed duck was closely related to the Australian blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis) but its bones were about one tenth smaller than those of its Australian relative. The holotype was found in 1967 at Lake Poukawa in Hawke's Bay, North Island, New Zealand and remains in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The specific name honours the late Australian ornithologist Gerard Frederick van Tets (1929‚Äì1995) who first recognized the relationship of this species with the stiff-tailed ducks in 1983. Because the bones of the New Zealand stiff-tailed duck were unlabeled, it was not until 2004 that Trevor H. Worthy from the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa identified 19 bones out of 13,000 fossil remains of waterfowl found in the Holocene deposits at Lake Poukawa. The fossil remains consist of left humeri, distal left humeri, right humeri, distal right humeri, and proximal right humeri. The New Zealand stiff-tailed duck presumably became extinct due to overhunting by the MƒÅori in the 16th century.  References  *Tennyson, A. & Martinson, P.: Extinct birds of New Zealand.

The vessel returned to Hoverspeed in 1999 to reopen the Newhaven-Dieppe route which had been closed by P&O; Stena Line earlier that year. Her place on the Irish Sea was taken by her sister, SuperSeaCat Three. In 2000, she once again sailed on the Irish Sea, this time between Heysham and Belfast but again returned to Hoverspeed this time for service between Dover and Calais or Ostend operating alongside 2 of her 3 sisters. After spending some time laid up in Portsmouth she returned to service on the Newhaven-Dieppe run before being chartered to the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, which had by then been sold by Sea Containers. In May 2008, it was announced that the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company had purchased Incat 050 (now Manannan), and it would replace Viking from the 2009 season. At the end of the 2008 season, Viking sailed to Alexandra Dock, Liverpool to lay-up for the winter. In January 2009, Viking left drydock to cover the passenger sailings of Ben-my-Chree, which had gone into drydock for propeller repairs. After Ben-my-Chree returned to service, Viking returned to lay-up in Liverpool. Atl√¢nticoline Viking was expected to depart from Liverpool for her Azores charter to Atl√¢nticoline around 5‚Äì6 July . A side-loading door that was fabricated in Portsmouth was fitted. She did not leave until 23 July due to a leak that was found when her fuel tanks were being filled for her long voyage. The port side of Viking has lost the web address, \\"steam-packet.com\\", due to re-painting following the insertion of the side-loading vehicle door. During the voyage her hull was damaged due to weather and docked at Falmouth for repairs. She finally arrived in the Azores and began service on the morning of 5 August. Steam Packet masters were believed to be accompanying the ship for training purposes and then to act as the representatives. Hellenic Seaways Viking was sold to Hellenic Seaways and was renamed Hellenic Wind in September 2009. In early 2016, Hellenic Wind was renamed Hellenic Highspeed. Starting from April 2016, it operates on the Rafina - Cyclades line, calling at the ports of Tinos, Mykonos, Paros, Ios, Santorini.

His complete name is Shahab al-Din Abu'l-'Abbas Ahmad ibn 'Umar ibn Mohammad al-Ansari al-Mursi. Al-Mursi Abul-'Abbas, as he is now commonly called, is one of the four master saints of Egypt, the other three being Ahmad al-Badawi, al-Dessouqi and al-Haggag. His legacy and reverence in Egypt were such that Mursi became a common name in the country. In al-Andalus Shahab was born in Murcia in al-Andalus, in 616 H (1219 CE) to a wealthy family in the trading business and was well educated in religious sciences. He grew up helping his father in the trading business. He was known for his honesty and for his many contributions to the needy. He left Spain with his family in 640 H (1242 CE) in the face of increasing Christian control over Spain. He was accompanied by his father, brother, and his mother. However, his parents did not make it to Tunisia, their destination. Meeting al-Shadhili In Tunisia, Shahab heard about Shaykh Abu‚Äôl-Hassan ash-Shadhili, founder of the Shadhiliyya Sufi brotherhood, and he accompanied him when the latter moved to Alexandria in Egypt. Many Muslim scholars from Spain chose to live in Alexandria as Muslim Spain gradually fell under the domination of hostile Christian forces. Al-Shadhili was fond of Shahab who was becoming one of his best students. Abu'l-'Abbas al-Mursi (the Murcian) - as Shahab became known in Alexandria - married al Shadhili's daughter and had two daughters and a son from her. He lived 43 years in Alexandria as a Muslim teacher until he died in 686 H (1287 AD). His mosque in Alexandria El-Mursi Abul Abbas Mosque A mosque was built over his tomb in the Anfoushi district of Alexandria, which over time became the most famous of all of Alexandria's mosques, the El-Mursi Abul Abbas Mosque.

He was known for his roles as Andrew McNair in the musical 1776, Jim Sefelt in the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Johnny the Shoe Shine Guy on the 1982 crime comedy series Police Squad!. Described as a short, odd-looking character actor with a Shakespearean background, he had many minor roles in plays, films, and TV series. His last work was a cameo in the 2003 film How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Early life and career Duell was born in 1923 in Corinth, New York, to E. Janet (Harrington) and Leon George Duell, an employee of the International Paper Company.http://www.filmreference.com/film/54/William- Duell.html Sometime in his youth, his mother legally changed his name to Darwin William Duell. Duell never cared for his first name and thus always went by his middle name, William. Duell graduated from the Green Mountain Junior College (now Green Mountain College) (Vermont), Illinois Wesleyan University, and Yale University. A theater scholarship at Green Mountain College is named after him. He portrayed Congressional custodian Andrew McNair in the Broadway version of 1776, which made him the one actor who stayed throughout the entire run of the show and was never understudied; he also played the part in the 1972 film of the musical. In the 1997 Broadway revival of 1776 Duell was a replacement member of the cast, filling the role of Caesar Rodney after Michael McCormick took on the role of John Adams. In 2010, he appeared in a one-night only staged reading of Evening Primrose by Stephen Sondheim. Later life and death Duell married his wife, Mary Barto, in 2004. Duell died of respiratory failure in December 2011. He was 88.

It was issued as companion piece to the third state of his print of The Distrest Poet. Background In November 1740, Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: The Provok'd Musician, The Distrest Poet, and a third image on the subject of \\"Painting\\" . The third image was never completed, and the two other prints were issued together in November 1741. The engraving appears to be based on an oil sketch held in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, though there are some differences between the monochrome sketch and the engraving. Picture The image is ostensibly a purely comic scene. While the violinist attempts to rehearse, the noisiest inhabitants of London pass by his window. On the far left a squawking parrot perches above a pregnant ballad-seller singing \\"The Ladies' Fall\\" while holding her bawling baby. A young girl with a rattle (otherwise ratchet (instrument)) looks with amazement at a boy urinating below the musician's window (this is an often repeated image in Hogarth's work: similar scenes can be seen in The March to Finchley and in his illustrations for Hudibras and may be a reference to John Gay's \\"Trivia\\").Paulson p.145 The boy has a cord tied round his waist attached to a trailing slate which would clatter along the ground as he ran. In the centre of the picture a young milk- seller calling her wares provides the real focus of the picture; though set back more from the viewer than some of the subjects, she appears larger than the children and the crouching figure of the cutler. She balances a large pail of milk on her head and is the only subject that looks out at the viewer. This, combined with the large expanse of white apron, draws the viewer's eye towards her. Ronald Paulson, the modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that she is singing and that her beauty and grace‚Äîshe delicately lifts her skirt to avoid dragging it through the boy's urine‚Äîmark her out as the only natural musician in the scene; while the other inhabitants of the street produce discordant notes, the music of the violinist would be no better, because he has restricted himself by his studies and by removing himself from nature. He covers his ears to block out the cacophony of the street noise, but at the same time he denies himself the sweet music of the milkmaid's voice.Paulson p.115 John Savage's etching of Marcellus Laroon's (c.1688) The Merry Milk Maid. Images of the Cryes genre may have been a target of Hogarth's satire; Laroon's The Cryes of the City of London was the most popular series of this type during Hogarth's lifetime. The milkmaid is flanked on either side by street musicians: to her right a man plays a hautboy, metaphorically thumbing his nose at the violinist; and to her left a small boy beats a drum. Behind the milkmaid, a paviour beats the ground with a heavy rammer. In the lower right-hand corner a dog barks at the racket created by a knife-grinder sharpening a cleaver. Behind these characters, a host of street vendors noisily announce their services: a dustman with a basket on his back rings a handbell, a sow-gelder blows a horn, and a fishmonger cups his hand to his mouth as he shouts. In the distance there is a hint of yet more noise. A church‚Äîtraditionally identified as St Martin-in-the-Fields yet closer in form to St Giles-in-the-FieldsBarlow p.200‚Äîflies a flag, suggesting perhaps an important event during which bells would be rung. The building to the right is the works of pewterer John Long, from which would issue a constant ring of hammers, and on its roof two hissing cats with arched backs prepare to fight. Appearing from the chimney is a sweep who may be calling to an unseen colleague that his work is done. In the lower left corner some loose bricks‚Äîsuggestive of building works out of view‚Äîhave been piled up (no doubt noisily) into a little house. The long-nosed violinist framed in the open window clamps his hands to ears in frustration.Hallett p.138 While the image entertains purely by the number of references to noisy activities crammed into the scene, the play-bill for Gay's The Beggar's Opera, prominently displayed on the wall next to the musician's window, hints at developments in British music at the time. The Beggar's Opera had enjoyed extraordinary success and had caused, or at least coincided with, a shift in the taste of audiences away from Italian opera and towards \\"British\\" music and homegrown culture. Hogarth was an enthusiastic supporter of the change in public tastes. He had mocked the vogue for continental fashions in many of his works (A Rake's Progress and Marriage √†-la-mode both have scenes dedicated to the foolishness of the Lev√©e, and, in 1724, even before The Beggar's Opera, in the earliest of his self- published satirical prints The Bad Taste of the Town Hogarth mocked the fashion for Italian opera and Italian opera singers). The play-bill here is anachronistic as it advertises the play with the original 1728 cast. The musician's identity has never been satisfactorily established. He is identified as an Italian both by Jean Andr√© Rouquet, whose French notes on the prints were approved by Hogarth, and by John Trusler who claimed Hogarth's widow's approval for his Hogarth Moralized.Barlow p.201 He has been variously identified as a number of foreign musicians of the time, including \\"Corvetto, well known by the name of Nosee\\"Hogarth p.209 (probably Giacobbe Cervetto, often caricaturized for his large nose), and Pietro Castrucci, the leader of Handel's orchestra. Handel had noted the shift in public taste himself, and from the 1730s he composed more English oratorio and theatre works, including the setting the works of Milton, Dryden and Congreve to music. Hogarth, as well as comically juxtaposing high and low culture, could be suggesting that a foreign tradition is being silenced by a burgeoning sense of Britishness. This may have been an afterthought though, as the playbill was not present in the earliest impressions, and the hautboy player and paver are usually respectively identified as Jewish and Irish, while the drummer boy is dressed in the same fashion as the young Huguenot leaving the church in Noon, the second scene of Hogarth's Four Times of the Day. The musician has also been identified as John Festin (mistakenly rendered as Foster in some accounts), a teacher of the flute and hautboy, by Hogarth's friend and biographer John Ireland and later by the commentator John Trusler. The story Festin told Hogarth obviously provided the inspiration for at least part of the scene: The hautboy player has similarly defied identification. Charles Frederick Weideman, a leading London flautist, who had played the oboe earlier in his career, has been suggested as the flautist seen playing in plate 4 of Marriage √†-la-mode, and in The Enraged Musician: Hogarth's Musical Imagery, Jeremy Barlow claims that he and the hautboy player are one and the same.Barlow p.204 The presence of many street traders may also satirise Marcellus Laroon's much- copied 17th-century prints of The Cryes of the City of London and more recent images by Hogarth's rival, Giacomo Amiconi. Variations The early trial was not as crowded or, by extension, as noisy, as the issued print. The character of the drummer boy was most changed between versions, but other subjects also underwent alterations, and more features were added. An early trial impression was missing the church steeple, cats, the man blowing the horn and the play- bill. In this version the dustman was missing his nose (a sign that he was syphilitic), a doll was placed in the model brick house in the foreground, and the drummer boy sported a Grenadier's cap. The drummer was handsome and had turned to look towards the little girl. By the time the print was issued this suggestion of a domestic theme with the boy, girl, and house with \\"child\\" had been removed. The boy had his cap removed and his handsome face turned away from the girl and replaced by features which Charles Lamb described as \\"idiotic\\". The doll was removed and the girl given a rattle to add to the image of pure noise.Paulson. p.116 Later copies featured a black horse in place of the white horse ridden by the horn blower and showed cross-hatching on the sleeves of the ballad-seller and the play-bill. Later impressions also made the dog and grinder darker, while lightening the cap of the sow- gelder.Hogarth p.210 NotesReferences  * * Category:Prints by William Hogarth Category:1741 works Category:Musical instruments in art ","title":"The Enraged Musician"},{"id":"15099903","text":"Els Vanheusden is a Belgian physician, businesswoman and from 2004 until 31 May 2008, General Manager of FlandersBio, the cluster of the Flemish biotech industry.

The team was coached by Rocky Long. The New Mexico Lobos play their home games at University Stadium in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The team enjoyed success in comparison to the year before, where they went 6‚Äì6 before losing to San Jose State in the first inaugural New Mexico Bowl. The Lobos' schedule also appeared to be stronger, playing tough road games against Arizona, TCU, Utah, and San Diego State. ScheduleGame summaries=UTEP= Coming off a lackluster 6-7 season, the Lobos were determined to come away from El Paso with a victory. The game started off slow, with a combined score of just 3 points (UTEP's Jose Martinez scored a 51-yard field goal on their first possession). In the second quarter, the Lobos responded with a field goal of their own, bring the score to 3-3. Both teams' defenses held up for the remainder of the first half. To begin the third quarter, neither team could score. The two traded punts and had key defensive stops to end the third quarter still 3-3. Early success in the fourth quarter allowed New Mexico to go up 6-3 when John Sullivan connected for a 40-yard field goal. UTEP gained possession of the football and drove down the field, aided by two New Mexico penalties. Terrell Jackson broke free from defenders on a 36-yard run, and scored the night's only touchdown with 13:08 remaining. Despite the amount of time remaining, neither team would score again. The final was 10-6. It was the lowest point production by UTEP since 1975. =New Mexico State= In the annual Battle for 1-25, New Mexico State, which was losing in the overtime series between the two, was determined to pull out a victory against their instate rival New Mexico. New Mexico was ready, however, and their offense was on target most of the night. To begin the game, both sides showed their offenses, putting up 14 points on both sides of the scoreboard. The second quarter seemed to slow down the offensive production. New Mexico's defense allowed 0 points, while New Mexico State's gave up only a field goal. The score going into halftime was 17-14. In the third quarter, both teams again showed off their offense, but the defense was still strong. Both teams put up 10 points, making the score 27-24 going into the final quarter of the game. New Mexico scored a touchdown early in the quarter, while New Mexico State made a field goal, making the score 34-27 with around 7:00 left to play. NMSU had possession of the ball, and was driving down the field, led mostly by quarterback Chase Holbrook. Momentum swung, however, when an errant pass landed in the arms of New Mexico's Frankie Solomon. New Mexico quarterback Donovan Porterie stepped up quickly, connecting on a 50-yard pass to Travis Brown to reach the Aggies' 25-yard line. John Sullivan made a 21-yard field goal, putting the Lobos up 37-27 with 5:22 to play. Despite a 10-point deficit, the Aggies began to drive again, but their loss was guaranteed when Holbrook threw another interception. New Mexico quickly drove down the field and scored a touchdown, making the score 44-27. Holbrook would not quit, though, and he drove his Aggie team down for a touchdown with 1:16 left to play. On the onside kick, New Mexico State managed to retrieve the ball, but with such little time left, they could not score in time, reaching the 4-yard line when time expired. The game drew the fourth largest crowd ever in University Stadium, with an attendance of 41,033. University Stadium's capacity only reaches 38,634, but many fans sat on the grassy area on the southeast part of the stadium. With the win, the Lobos improved to 1-1. =Arizona= Coming off a big victory against rival New Mexico State, the Lobos headed into Arizona for a big road game. The first quarter saw impressive stats from both teams, with a close score of 7-10 leading into the second quarter. The second quarter was the start of Arizona's decline, with several key penalties called against them, and a turnover that led to a New Mexico touchdown. Going into halftime, the Lobos led 14-13. On their first possession of the third quarter, Arizona drove down the field to the 2-yard line. On the next play, however, they fumbled the ball, and New Mexico's OJ Smith picked it up. New Mexico quarterback Donovan Porterie led the Lobos down the field several times and allowed them to score 12 points. The Lobos had a comfortable 26-13 lead going into the fourth quarter. Arizona continued to play hard however, with quarterback Tuitama leading the Wildcats down the field. The team put up 14 points in the fourth quarter, but their mistakes in penalties and turnovers cost them, as New Mexico put up 3 points towards the end of the quarter, edging out Arizona 29-27. Donovan Porterie threw for 327 yards and had three touchdowns, and Arizona's Tuitama threw for 446 yards with three touchdowns. It was only the Lobos' second win against a Pac-10 team in 11 games. With the victory, the Lobos improved to 2-1. =Sacramento State= After an impressive win in Arizona, the Lobos returned home to face 1-AA opponent Sacramento State. The Hornets came into the game 0-6 against Division I-A football teams. New Mexico running back Rodney Ferguson had a total of 129 yards rushing and a career-high four touchdowns. Donovan Porterie threw for 229 yards and one touchdown. The Hornets were mistake ridden, giving up key turnovers and were not able to have offensive success. They could not score any points throughout the entire game, and the Lobos won 58-0. With the win, the Lobos improved to 3-1 =BYU= In an important Mountain West Conference game, BYU came to New Mexico with a 1-0 conference record. Both teams had strong momentum coming into the game, with New Mexico on a 3 game win streak. The first three quarters of the game were mostly even, with both offenses trading touchdowns and punts. Donovan Porterie and Max Hall were impressive, and the score leading into the fourth quarter was a tie; 21-21. Early in the fourth quarter, the Lobos fumbled the ball away to BYU, which set up a touchdown by Hall. The Lobos quickly drove down the field and answered with a 43-yard field goal, making the score 28-24. New Mexico managed to hold BYU to a three and out possession, but the momentum quickly shifted when Frankie Solomon fumbled on the punt return. Hall led the team down the field, and set up a 22-yard field goal, causing the Cougars to hold a 31-24 lead. New Mexico was unable to move down the field and was forced to punt. The Cougars ran down the clock, which led to their victory. With the loss, the Lobos fell to 3-2 overall and 0-1 in conference play. =Wyoming= Following their loss to BYU, the Lobos headed to Wyoming for their second Mountain West Conference game. On their first possession of the game, the Lobos charged down field on a drive that ended in a 39-yard John Sullivan field goal, giving the Lobos an early lead. For the rest of the first quarter, neither team managed to gain enough offensive momentum to score. At the end of quarter, a weather delay was issued because of strong lightning and heavy rain in the area. The delay would go on to last 1 hour and 43 minutes. After the delay, the second quarter began and New Mexico drove down the field, with Donovan Porterie completing a 63-yard TD pass to Travis Brown. The game went to halftime, but it was shortened to only 3 minutes because of the delay. Early in the third quarter, Wyoming quarterback Karsten Sween fumbled on their own 2-yard line, leading to a New Mexico score. Later in the quarter, New Mexico scored a field goal, bringing the score to 20-3. Neither team would score in the fourth quarter, and New Mexico walked away with the win. With the win, the Lobos improved to 4-2 overall and 1-1 in conference play. =San Diego State= Coming off a road win against Wyoming, the Lobos visited Qualcomm Stadium to face another important conference game against San Diego State. In the first quarter of the game, neither team showed any offensive breakthroughs, with New Mexico scoring only a field goal, and SDSU scoring nothing. The score going into the second quarter was 3-0 In the second quarter, San Diego State's quarterback Kevin O'Connell had success moving his team down the field, on a drive where he himself scored a rushing touchdown. SDSU also scored a field goal on a later possession. New Mexico quickly responded with a touchdown of their own, leaving the score 10-10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Lobos seemed to be out of sync offensively, while San Diego State forced them to punt. O'Connell was able to push his offense down the field and scored another rushing touchdown, making the score 10-17. Early in the fourth quarter, New Mexico began to move down the field, but their drive ended with a field goal only. The score was now 17-14. The Aztecs moved down the field rather quickly, and appeared to have the game in hand, but O'Connell made a crucial mistake when he fumbled the ball trying to run for the first down. The Lobos recovered and drove down the field. Rodney Ferguson's six-yard touchdown run with 15 seconds left in the game lifted New Mexico to a 20-17 victory. With the win, the Lobos improved to 5-2 overall and 2-1 in conference play. =Air Force= With an impressive 5-2(2-1) record, New Mexico looked to defeat another Mountain West Conference team with an impressive record; Air Force. Early in the first quarter, the New Mexico offense drove down the field twice, one ending in a field goal, and the other in a Rodney Fergusson touchdown run. The Falcons also had success early on, responding right back to bring the score leading into the second quarter to 10-7. In the second quarter, the Falcons stopped the Lobos and drove down the field to score a touchdown that gave them the lead by 3. The Lobos could not respond with any points and were forced to punt. Air Force then rolled down the field again, scoring another touchdown. The Lobos drove down the field and scored a field goal late in the quarter, cutting the Falcons' lead to 8. On the kickoff however, Air Force's Ty Paffette fumbled the ball and New Mexico. With just 20 seconds left in the game, Donovan Porterie managed to throw a touchdown pass to tight end Chris Mark, which led to a tie game, 21-21, at halftime. In the third quarter, both teams again traded touchdowns, tying the score at 28-28. Later on in the quarter, Air Force managed to score a field goal, giving them the lead. In the fourth quarter, Air Force began to drive down the field twice, but on both those possessions they fumbled the ball away to New Mexico. The Lobos put up 6 points, including one field goal with just seconds left in the game to pull away from Air Force in a 34-31 victory. With the win, the Lobos improved to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in conference play. =TCU= With the Lobos off to an impressive 6-2 start, most people could not have predicted what would happen when they invaded TCU for a key conference game. For all of the game, Donovan Porterie was completely shut down, throwing for just 76 yards. TCU also shut down Rodney Ferguson, allowing him only 28 yards. On the other side of the ball, TCU was rolling over the Lobo defense. Quarterback Andy Dalton threw 2 touchdowns, backup Marcus Brock threw 1, and the Horned Frogs made 3 field goals. They shut out the Lobos in a surprising 0-37 game. With the loss, the Lobos fell to 6-3 overall and 3-2 in conference play. =Colorado State= The Lobos returned home after a devastating loss to TCU to face their next MWC opponent, Colorado State. New Mexico seemed to dominate for most of the first quarter, putting up 17 points and allowing Colorado State just 7. Donovan Porterie threw both touchdowns, and John Sullivan kicked a field goal. Going into the second quarter, the score was 17-7. In the second quarter, the Rams began to rally back, scoring a touchdown early on. For the rest of the quarter, both teams had strong defensive stops leading to two field goals scored by each team. The score going into halftime was a close 20-17. To start the second half, the Lobos marched down the field in a drive that ended with a John Sullivan field goal. The Rams could not gain any offensive momentum, and was shut out for the remainder of the quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the Rams pushed a long drive down the field and scored a field goal, bringing the score to 23-20 with 12:05 remaining. The Lobos fumbled the ball to Colorado State at the Lobos' 25-yard line. The Rams again moved down the field to tie the game at 23 with a 32-yard field goal with 8:24 left. Both teams were stopped and were forced to punt. When the Rams punted the ball to Marcus Smith, he ran back for 18 yards, to bring it to the Rams' 26-yard line with just 3 seconds remaining. John Sullivan kicked the game winning 43-yard field goal as time expired. With the win, the Lobos improved to 7-3 overall and 4-2 in conference play. =Utah= The Lobos were again on the road to face a very important game against Utah. Both teams were fighting for their post season appearance in a bowl game, and both teams came into the game with the same overall and conference record. The first quarter of the game proved to be an offensive battle, as the defense on both sides of the ball allowed 0 points. On the Lobos' first possession, they appeared to be moving down the field effectively, but running back Rodney Ferguson fumbled away to the Utes. Both teams traded punts, making the score 0-0 going into the second quarter. In the second quarter, the Utes began to move down the field more efficiently, scoring a touchdown early on. The Lobos' were still having difficulties on offense, and were unable to score any points. Utah moved down the field again, scoring another touchdown to make the score 0-14 going into halftime. In the third quarter, Utah quarterback Brian Johnson threw a costly interception, and the Lobos were able to score a touchdown, making the score 7-14. Utah again struggled on offense and punted away to the Lobos. New Mexico rolled down the field, and scored a field goal to make it 10-14 with 4:09 left in the quarter. New Mexico made a costly turnover of their own when Ian Clark fumbled the ball away on the 39-yard line. The Utes would score a touchdown with 49 seconds left in the quarter to make the score 10-21. Early in the fourth quarter, the Lobos fumbled the ball again on a punt return, giving the ball to Utah on the 5-yard line. New Mexico would get the ball right back, however, as Johnson fumbled trying to run up the middle. New Mexico was driving down the field, when Paul Kruger knocked the ball out of Donovan Porterie's hands, where Koa Misi picked it up and ran it back for a Utes touchdown. With only 6:57 left in the game and the score 10-28, the Lobos could not make a comeback. With the loss, the Lobos fell to 7-4 overall and 4-3 in conference play. =UNLV= In the last regular season game of the year, the Lobos needed a win in order to appear in a bowl game. Their opponent was UNLV, who came into the game on a 14-game losing streak on the road against Mountain West opponents. In the first quarter, both teams moved the ball rather well, leading to field goals. The score going into the second quarter was a tied 3-3. In the second quarter, New Mexico had great offensive success, scoring two touchdowns, one by a 63-yard pass to Marcus Smith, and the other with a run by Travis Brown.

With the win, the Lobos improved to 8-4 overall and 5-3 in conference play. =Nevada= New Mexico finished strong in the Mountain West Conference, allowing them a trip to the New Mexico Bowl for the second year in a row. They would face 6-6 Nevada. The Lobos would be without their star running back Rodney Fergusson because of academic issues. To start the game, Donovan Porterie threw two touchdown passes, giving the Lobos a big lead over the Wolfpack. Nevada was stopped short on every drive, scoring 0 points in the entire game. John Sullivan kicked 3 field goals, two in the second quarter, and one in the fourth. Nevada had just 210 total yards to New Mexico's 518. The Lobos shut out Nevada 23-0. The win ended the 46-year-long drought the Lobos faced in the post season, and it marked the first bowl victory under Rocky Long. With the win, the Lobos finished the season 9-4.

In the Breakout sections, players control a paddle and must prevent a ball from touching the bottom of the screen by bouncing it back up the screen. The play area contains rows of bricks which must be destroyed by bouncing the ball against them. Destroying bricks releases power-ups and prizes, which can be collected. If the paddle is hit by enemies or weapons fire it begins to overheat, forcing the player to vent it and release heat, in turn preventing the paddle from being moved for a short period. The game is known for its odd humor, featuring cows and wolves falling from the top of the screen, monkeys being fired from a barrel and dogs flying across the screen destroying bricks in their path.

Biography McCall joined the Army from Veedersburg, Indiana, and by January 22, 1944 was serving as a Staff Sergeant in Company F, 143rd Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division. On that day, near San Angelo, Italy, he led his machine gun section in the crossing of the Gari River (erroneously identified as the Rapido1944: la battaglia di S.Angelo in Theodice e la confusione tra i fiumi Rapido e Gari, 1944: the Battle of St. Angelo in Theodice and the Confusion between Rapido and Gari rivers.) despite intense German fire. After all his men had been either killed or wounded, he single-handedly used his machine gun to destroy two enemy machine gun positions and charged a third before being captured by the Germans. For his actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor the next year, on April 17, 1945. McCall also served and was wounded in the Korean War, reaching the rank of Master Sergeant. McCall died at age 49 and was buried in Spring Vale Cemetery, Lafayette, Indiana. He drowned while rescuing his 8-year-old son, Thomas. Medal of Honor citation Staff Sergeant McCall's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond > the call of duty. On 22 January 1944, Company F had the mission of crossing > the Rapido River in the vicinity of San Angelo, Italy, and attacking the > well-prepared German positions to the west.

The building is named after the influential evangelical minister Dr. Clarence E. Macartney who grew up in Fern Cliffe House when the college moved to Beaver Falls in 1880. Today, the library consists of more than 400,000 items available to students and professors as well as surrounding community members.Guide to the McCartney Library (2007-2008), page 5.,2007 There is an online database for the library, and also an online catalog called \\"MacCat\\". The library includes a newly refurbished media center located on the ground floor and also houses collections of books about the college and the history of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, along with many other sources in the Covenanter Collection, the Geneva Author Collection, and Dr. Macartney's private collection; developed over the 160-year history of Geneva College. Mission statement The McCartney Library's mission is to provide the students, faculty, and friends of Geneva College with the information service, books, journals, pamphlets, microforms, electronic data, audio-visual media, and instructional presentation materials needed to educate and minister to a diverse Christian learning community. Library materials and service are for the purpose of developing servant-leaders and to assist them in transforming society for the Kingdom of Christ. To this end, the Library collects, organizes, and circulates the learning resources in an efficient and effective manner to meet their general informational and recreational needs, and to encourage the development of lifelong learning skills.Guide to the McCartney Library (2007-2008), page 6.,2007 History In the 1930s, S.J., E.J., and S.M. Deal (three sisters from Clarence E. Macartney's congregation) donated the funds for the construction of a college library in honor of their pastor. They employed architect and designer, William G. Eckles, who also designed Geneva's Johnston Gymnasium and McKee Hall, to design the library. More on the architecture and history of the constructing of the library can be found in the book, Pro Christo et Patria: A History of Geneva College, by David M. Carson.Carson, David M. _Pro Christo et Patria_. Virginia Beach: Donning Co. Pub., 1997. Some of the most notable features of the library are the beautiful and ornate stained glass windows, which were created by Harry Lee Willet, a friend of Macartney and a prominent glass maker who owned one of the largest glass making companies in the United States. The Reading Rooms of the library each house a glass window high. One of the windows depicts John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, and the other, John Milton's Paradise Lost. The history of the Paradise Lost window and the story that is told by it is given in the book Paradise Lost Windows: A Story in Lead and Light by Shirley J. Kilpatrick and M. Howard Mattsson-Boz√©, two Geneva professors.Kilpatrick, Shirley J. and M. Howard Mattson-Boz√©. Paradise Lost Windows: A Story in Lead and Light. Beaver Falls: Fern Cliffe House Pub., 2007. The library has also hosted community and regional conferences for several non-profit and for-profit organizations. Willet Windows Willet Windows in the library's East Reading Room One notable feature of the Library is its stained glass windows. Henry Lee Willet of Willet Stained Glass Studios, was commissioned by the Deal sisters to design and produce both of the eighteen-paneled windows in each reading room of the McCartney Library. Willet, who was a close friend of Clarence E. Macartney, was thrilled to take the project. Willet was one of the foremost stained glass makers of his time. Among his other commissions are windows at the Chapel at the United Nations, the Washington National Cathedral and the Chapel of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Willet Studios still exists, having merged in 2005 with the Hauser Art Glass Company to become the Willet Hauser Architectural Glass. It is the largest stained glass company in North America, and has creations in over 14 countries. The Library's Reading Rooms house the two windows, each standing fifteen feet tall. One of the windows provides an artistic depiction of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, and the other is a depiction of John Milton's Paradise Lost. Deal Carillon Main bell with others in the background Another feature of the library building is the Deal Carillon located in the building's bell tower. The Deal Carillon is an array of 14 bells, ranging in weight from 350 to 3,000 pounds. The bells were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry, one of the oldest foundries in the United States. They are also inscribed with psalms and excerpts from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam. The Deal Carillon has the special McShane Chime Ringer system, which enables the Carillon to be played as a musical instrument by using a special keyboard.

The defeat of the German garrison required almost an entire month of painstaking reduction of fortified positions, intense urban combat, and a final assault on the city's citadel by the Red Army, complete with medieval touches.The storm operation recalled the breaking of a medieval siege, Erickson, p. 523 Background The city of Pozna≈Ñ (called Posen in German) lay in the western part of Poland which had been annexed by Nazi Germany following their invasion of Poland in 1939, and was the chief city of Reichsgau Wartheland. By 1945, the Red Army advances on the Eastern Front had driven the Germans out of eastern Poland as far as the Vistula River. The Red Army launched the Vistula-Oder Offensive on 12 January 1945, inflicted a huge defeat on the defending German forces, and advanced rapidly into western Poland and eastern Germany. Certain cities which lay on the path of the Soviet advance were declared by Hitler to be Festungen (strongholds), where the garrisons were ordered to mount last-ditch stands. Hitler hoped the Festung cities could hold out behind Soviet lines and interfere with the movement of supplies and lines of communication.Duffy, p. 249, Erickson, p. 523 Pozna≈Ñ was declared a Festung in January 1945.Erickson, p. 470, Baumann, p. 11 The city was defended by 40,000 German troops from a great variety of units including Volkssturm, Luftwaffe ground forces, police, and highly motivated officer candidates.Duffy, p. 102. Some of the larger German units were the Fifth Infantry Officer Candidate School, Assault Gun Replacement Battalion 500, five Landessch√ºtzen battalions, one Volkssturm Battalion, Air Force Replacement Battalions I and IV, Fortress Antitank Battalion 102, Police Regiment Schallert, Kampfgruppe Lenzer, and six batteries of fortress artillery. Facing them were the experienced Guards Rifle troops of General V. I Chuikov's 8th Guards Army ‚Äì the victors of Stalingrad. The defenders made use of some of the surviving Festung Posen fortifications that had been built during Prussian rule in the 19th century. The Fort Winiary citadel stood on a hill to the north of the city centre. Around the perimeter of the city were 18 massively- built forts, spaced at intervals of about 2 kilometres in a ring with a radius of about 5 kilometres. General Chuikov described the forts as > . . . underground structures each with several storeys, the whole projecting > above the surrounding terrain. Only a mound was visible above ground -- the > layer of earth covering the rest. Each fort was ringed by a ditch ten metres > wide and eight metres deep, with walls revetted with brickwork. Across the > ditch was a bridge, leading to one of the upper storeys. Among the forts, to > the rear, there were one-storey brick bunkers. These were clad in concrete > almost a full metre thick, and were used as stores. The upper works of the > forts were sufficiently strong to provide reliable protection against heavy > artillery fire. . . . the enemy would be able to direct fire of all kinds > against us both on the approaches to the forts and within them, on the > rampart. The embrasures were such that flanking fire from rifles and > machine-guns could be directed from them.Chuikov, pp. 98-99 The city encircled Pozna≈Ñ lay on the main route between Warsaw and Berlin, and in German hands, it was a serious obstacle to any Soviet operation against the German capital. Thus, the Red Army had to clear the city of German troops before the final assaults designed to capture Berlin and end the war could begin. On 21 January 1945 the Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army forced a crossing of the Warta River north of the city, but by 24 January these bridgeheads had been abandoned in favor of better bridgeheads south of Pozna≈Ñ. Meanwhile, Red Army tank units had swept north and south of the city, capturing hundreds of German aircraft in the process.Duffy, p. 101. Moving further west, the Soviet tank units left the capture of the city to other Red Army forces. By 25 January, the Soviet 8th Guards Army had arrived and began a systematic reduction of the fortress. The following day, two of Pozna≈Ñ's forts in the south fell to a hasty assault conducted by the 27th and 74th Guards Rifle Divisions. This initial success allowed Chuikov's troops to penetrate the ring of forts and attack other forts from inside the city. On 28 January, the German high command relieved Generalmajor Ernst Mattern as the fortress commander and replaced him with a dedicated Nazi, Generalmajor Ernst Gonell. Gonell imposed draconian discipline on the German garrison. In some instances, German troops attempting to surrender were shot by their own side. Ultimately, the reduction of Festung Posen consumed the efforts of four divisions from Chuikov's army and two divisions of Colonel-General V. Ia. Kolpakchi's 69th Army. The 117th and 312th Rifle Divisions of the 91st Rifle Corps of 69th Army were deployed on the east side of the city. To the north, the 39th Guards Rifle Division of Chuikov's 28th Guards Rifle Corps, and to the south, Chuikov's 29th Guards Rifle Corps composed of the 27th, 74th, and 82nd Guards Rifle Divisions were arrayed against the Festung.Chuikov, pp. 97-98, and Baumann, p. 269. By the southwestern suburb of Junikowo, the 11th Guards Tank Corps took up positions to block any German attempt at retreat. The capture of Pozna≈Ñ Poznan Town Hall damaged in the fighting In bitter combat that saw the outlying forts reduced and city blocks seized, the Soviets succeeded in pushing the German defenders towards the city center and the citadel. By the beginning of February 1945, most of the city had been captured, and by 12 February, the Germans held only the imposing citadel. Generalmajor Gonell had previously believed that other German forces would attack and relieve his besieged forces, but by 15 February came to the realization that this was not going to happen. Incensed, he ordered his troops that were east of the Warta River to attempt to break out, and some 2,000 German soldiers managed to infiltrate the Red Army lines and head west on the following night. Arrayed against the citadel was the 29th Guards Rifle Corps, with the 27th Guards Rifle Division on the north, the 82nd Guards Rifle Division on the southwest, and the 74th Guards Rifle Division on the southeast. The final Soviet assault on the citadel started on 18 February. Before the Red Army troops lay a deep ditch matched by a steep rampart on the far side. In an odd echo of medieval warfare, the Soviet forces used ladders to cross this obstacle, but found themselves swept by fire from the citadel's redoubts. These redoubts took the better part of three days to neutralize; one was silenced by flamethrowers and explosives, the other's line of fire was blocked by debris thrown in front of the firing ports by exasperated Soviet troops. Having built an assault bridge, Red Army tanks and assault guns crossed into the main grounds of the citadel early on 22 February, commencing the final struggle for the old fortress. At this point, Generalmajor Gonell gave his troops permission to attempt to escape, but it was too late. Gonell refused to be captured and committed suicide by lying down on a flag and shooting himself in the head. That evening, Generalmajor Mattern, once again in charge of the German forces, surrendered the remaining 12,000 German soldiers to General Chuikov.Duffy, p. 250. Aftermath The Germans held out in Pozna≈Ñ for almost a month. Doubtlessly, their possession of the city complicated Soviet resupply efforts, but other influences had also convinced the Stavka to pause the Red Army advance at the Oder River instead of attempting to push on to Berlin in February 1945. The battle left over half (90% in the city center) of Pozna≈Ñ severely damaged by artillery fire and the effects of infantry combat in the city blocks. The battle definitively reduced the old Prussian fortress system which today stands mostly as monuments to an earlier military era. Finally, the outcome of the battle simplified Soviet resupply efforts between Warsaw and the Oder River. Over 5,000 German troopers who fell in the battle are buried at Milostowo cemetery. The Soviets are estimated to have lost over 12,000 men by the battle's midpoint around 3 February 1945. Today, the Pozna≈Ñ Citadel site is a large park, in which are situated the remains of some of the fortifications, a memorial to the Red Army, military cemeteries, and a military museum containing exhibits relating to the 1945 battle.

In 1955 the film was third in attendance in the Soviet Union, collecting 39.16 million ticket sales. The motion picture tells a story of the underground struggle of Italian patriots against the Austrian invaders for independence of their homeland. Against the background of these events is a tragic story of a man transformed from a pure heart and an enthusiastic young man to an ruthless revolutionary - the legendary and elusive Gadfly. The film adaptation is more ideological than the Voynich novel. The romantic subplot was significantly reduced; Arthur and Gemma are shown not as lovers but as party comrades and the jealousy between Arthur and Giovanni due to Gemma is not depicted. Plot Young student Arthur Burton says goodbye to his beloved teacher, the priest Montanelli, who is departing to Rome on the orders of the Pope. Arthur participates in activities of the organization \\"Young Italy\\". He is resentful of its leader, Giovanni Bolla; he experiences jealousy towards him regarding his girlfriend Gemma and confesses this to the priest, father Cardi. After the confession all revolutionaries end up arrested by the gendarmes. Arthur is walking through the prison courtyard and admits to Giovanni what he told in the confessional and Giovanni calls him a traitor. Arthur gets released from prison and tries to tell Gemma about what happened but she slaps him and runs away. Back home Arthur learns from his uncle Burton that his real father is Montanelli. Arthur's world falls apart before his eyes, he breaks his crucifix and runs out of his home. Everyone considers him dead. Many years later Arthur comes home adorned with scars which he received from revolutionary battles in South America. Under the pseudonym of Gadfly he joins the revolutionaries and leads an armed struggle in Italy and terrifies the Austrian invaders. To the revolutionary intellectuals he is known under the name Felice Rivarez. The Austrian emperor sends an additional military contingent to Italy and Cardi's father welcomes marching Austrian soldiers and their commander. Gadfly is involved in a secret weapons delivery but the police agents are on his tail. The Carbonari retreat from battle but Rivarez lowers his weapon as he hears the order of Montanelli and is taken prisoner. The death sentence has been predetermined for him. Compatriots give a file to the prisoner and he saws through the bars but falls unconscious in the prison yard. Before the execution Arthur admits to Montanelli that he is his son and offers his shocked father a choice between fighting for freedom or faith in Christ. The cardinal offers his son an escape but Arthur does not want to take life or become a servant of the church. Austrians shoot Gadfly at dawn and he commands his own execution. Montanelli screams in terror that there is no God. Music The film's score was composed by Dmitri Shostakovich. In the later arrangement by the composer's friend, Levon Atovmyan, the music from the film became very well known. The \\"Romance\\" is one of the most famous compositions of the 20th century. The complete original score was reconstructed by conductor Mark Fitz-Gerald and published in 2016 as Volume 138 of the DSCH New Collected Works edition. A recording was made with Fitz-Gerald conducting the Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz and published in 2017 by Naxos.

A small part of the park is a National Historic Landmark, as it was the site of the earliest documented afforestation in North America. In 1805, Russian agents planted an unknown number of Sitka spruce trees in the area, of which six were documented to be surviving in 1978. History Amaknak Island was naturally treeless, lying well outside the known growing range for trees in either Alaska or Siberia. The forestation attempt was ordered in 1805 by Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, a principal in the Russian-American Company who had secured a monopoly on the fur trade in the area. It was reported ten years later that only a small number of trees were still alive. In 1834 Bishop Ivan Veniaminov reported that there were 24 trees, several of which were more than tall. Veniaminov spearheaded a second forestation effort at a second site on Expedition Island, about south of the first site. The site was first documented by a professional botanist in 1899 when Bernhard Fernow visited Unalaska Island with the Harriman Alaska Expedition. At that time there were 19 trees, the tallest over . The site has since then been the subject of periodic reports. Prior to World War II there ten trees standing, four of which were probably killed as a result of the United States Army's partial filling in of a nearby pond with gravel.

Made from fibreglass, they may be used to land vehicles without jetties or harbour facilities. They were designed by the design team at Smallfry in the 1970s.  History  The vehicle was designed by the design team at Smallfry led by designer Tim Fry and Anthony Smallhorn with input from James Dyson while he was a student in the 1970s, as part of his final year's project at the Royal College of Art. Jeremy Fry was co-designer, along with Dyson, who was working at Rotork at the time. Dyson used the Sea Truck as part of his final year's project at the Royal College of Art. It happened to be the first engineering project for James Dyson of the Dyson company, as he had not even learned welding before. He and Fry built the prototype together. The craft was manufactured by Rotork Marine in Bath, England. It was a high-speed \\"flat-hulled fiberglass landing craft that could deliver cargo where no harbor or jetty was available.\\" According to Wired Magazine and Dyson, it was described as a \\"Welsh dresser on water,\\" with Dyson saying he learned not to prioritize conventional appearances with his projects, as \\"what it did, it did rather well.\\" It was adopted for use by the oil and construction industries, as well as military use, and could carry three tons at 50 miles per hour. In 1973, the Sea Truck was used by the Egyptian army in the Yom Kippur war.  Awards  For his work on the Sea Truck, in 1975 Dyson won the Duke of Edinburgh's Special Prize. In 1979 the Sea Truck won the Design Council Award for Engineering Products, and the Series 5 Sea Truck, credited to the Rotork Marine Design team with Tim Fry and Anthony Smallhorn of Smallfry Ltd. as consulting designer won the Prince Philip Designers Prize.  Versions  There were 5 versions of the Sea Truck. Jeremy Fry invented the original Sea Truck and the Mark2 version. Dyson as a student was involved in the Mark 3.

The screenplay by Ben Hecht, based in part on a 1930 play by Laurence Stallings, was the second feature film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's 1929 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. It was the last film produced by David O. Selznick. The logo for 20th Century Fox also does not appear at the beginning, due to the movie's poor reception. An earlier film version starred Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. Plot Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson) is an American officer serving in an ambulance unit for the Italian Army during World War I. While recovering from a wound in a British base hospital in northern Italy, he is cared for by Catherine Barkley (Jennifer Jones), a Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps nurse he had met earlier, near the front, and they engage in an affair. Frederick's friend, the doctor, convinces the army that Frederick's knee is more severely wounded than it actually is and the two continue their romance but never get married. Catherine discovers she is pregnant but after sneaking alcohol into the hospital for Frederick, the head nurse Miss Van Campen (Mercedes McCambridge) discovers the duplicity and separates them. She informs Frederick's superiors that he has fully recovered from his wounds and is ready for active duty. During their separation, Catherine comes to believe Frederick has abandoned her. Following the Battle of Caporetto, Frederick and his close friend Major Alessandro Rinaldi (Vittorio De Sica) are among the dispirited and retreating Italian army. Along the path or the retreat, several people die or are left behind due to exhaustion. Raving with illness, exhaustion and depression, Major Rinaldi professes defeatism with the pair arrested by the Carabinieri. A drumhead court-martial sentences Rinaldi to execution by firing squad that is immediately carried out. Enraged, Frederick knocks out the kerosene lamps and flees, jumping into the river. Wanted by the Italian authorities, Frederick evades capture and meets up with Catherine. They flee Milan to hide out on a lake on the Italian-Swiss border (Lake Lugano or Lake Maggiore). Fearing arrest by the police, Catherine persuades Frederick to flee to Switzerland by rowboat; after some adventures, they land successfully in Switzerland. Claiming to be tourists trying to evade the war, the two are allowed to remain in neutral Switzerland. Catherine's pregnancy progresses but due to the conditions around them, the pregnancy becomes complicated and Catherine is hospitalized. Their child is stillborn, and Catherine dies shortly afterward. Frederick leaves, shocked, and wanders the empty streets.

Selznick had wanted to film the Hemingway novel, but Warner Bros. owned the property and refused to sell it to him. He found himself in an advantageous bargaining position when Warner Bros. bought the remake rights to A Star is Born, to which he owned the foreign rights. Without them, the studio could not release their intended remake with Judy Garland overseas. Selznick offered to relinquish his rights to Star in exchange for the rights to Farewell, and Warner Bros. agreed.Memo from David O. Selznick, selected and edited by Rudy Behlmer, The Viking Press, 1972, pg. 441 On October 25, 1956, Selznick contacted director John Huston at the Blue Haven Hotel in Tobago and enthusiastically welcomed him to the project. He advised him his contract with 20th Century Fox called for severe financial penalties if the film went over schedule and/or budget, and urged him to concentrate wholly on the film until principal filming was completed.Memo from David O. Selznick, pp. 442-443 Selznick's concerns increased as Huston began to tinker with the script and spend an inordinate amount of time on pre-production preparations, and on March 19, 1957, he sent the director a lengthy memo outlining the problems he foresaw arising from Huston's lack of cooperation.Memo from David O. Selznick, pp. 446-452 Two days later, Huston announced he could not agree with Selznick on any of the issues he had raised and quit the project. Based on correspondence to Charles Vidor, it appears the producer's relationship with Huston's replacement was acrimonious as well.Memo from David O. Selznick, pp. 453-462 The producer later said the film was \\"not one of the jobs of which I am most proud.\\"Memo from David O. Selznick, pg. 441 The film was shot on location in the Italian Alps, Venzone in the Province of Udine in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lazio, and Rome. It was budgeted at $4,100,000, $4.2 million or $4,353,000. According to Carlos Baker's 1969 biography Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story, the Nobel Laureate was informed by Selznick that he would receive a $50,000 bonus from any profits the movie made. Unhappy at Selznick's nepotistic decision to cast his nearly 40-year-old wife as a character intended to be in her early 20s, he wrote back \\"If, by some chance your movie, which features the 38-year- old Mrs. Selznick as 24-year-old Catherine Barkley, does succeed in earning $50,000, I suggest that you take all of that money down to the local bank, have it converted to nickels, and then shove them up your ass until they come out your mouth.\\". A. E. Hotchner also refer this anecdote in his 2018 book Papa Hemingway: A Personal Memoir. Reception=Critical response= Hemingway's intuition proved correct as A Farewell To Arms opened to low box office receipts and harsh negative reviews after it premiered in 1957. The film would be forgotten by the moviegoing public as an epic in later years. In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther noted, \\"Mr. Selznick's picture . . . lacks that all-important awareness of the inescapable presence and pressure of war. That key support to the structure of the theme has been largely removed by Ben Hecht's script and by a clear elimination of subtle thematic overtones . . . [it] is a tedious account of a love affair between two persons who are strangely insistent upon keeping it informal . . . as a pure romance . . . it has shortcomings. The essential excitement of a violent love is strangely missing in the studied performances that Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones give in the leading roles. Mr. Hudson is most noticeably unbending, as if he were cautious and shy, but Miss Jones plays the famous Catherine Barkley with bewildering nervous moves and grimaces. The show of devotion between two people is intensely acted, not realized. It is questionable, indeed, whether Mr. Hudson and Miss Jones have the right personalities for these roles.\\"New York Times review TV Guide calls it \\"an overblown Hollywood extravaganza that . . . hasn't improved with age . . . the chief virtue of this hollow epic is the stupendous color photography of the Italian Alps . . . also enjoyable is Vittorio De Sica's inspired performance as the wily Maj. Rinaldi, but it's not enough to offset the flagrant overacting by Jones and the woodenness of Hudson.\\" Time Out New York describes it as an \\"inflated remake\\" with \\"surplus production values and spectacle\\" and adds, \\"A padded Ben Hecht script and Selznick's invariable tendency to overkill are equally to blame.\\" In his review of the DVD release, Jeremiah Kipp of Slant Magazine awarded the film two out of a possible five stars and stated, \\"To those willing to endure A Farewell To Arms: Don't be a hero! . . . We have David O. Selznick to blame for this bloated two-hour-plus Technicolor remake, announcing from the larger-than-life opening credits set against epic shots of sunsets, mountains, and valleys that he's aiming for another Gone with the Wind . . . without compelling lovers at the heart of his grand-scale love story, it's all just a meaningless protracted spectacle.\\" After this film, David O. Selznick left the movies completely, producing no other films. The movie earned an estimated $5 million in North American rentals\\"All-Time Top Grossers\\", Variety, 8 January 1964 p 69 and by the end of 1958 had made worldwide rentals of $6.9 million. Fox made some money on the movie but Selznick did not recover his costs. =Awards and nominations= Vittorio De Sica was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor but lost to Red Buttons for Sayonara.

The island is located about south of Homer. The island is archaeologically sensitive, with a number of sites documenting the prehistory of the bay. The Yukon Island Main Site, a National Historic Landmark, is a major shell midden site at which the pioneering archaeologist Frederica de Laguna was able to sequence 1500 years of the area's prehistory, and other sites have been found on the island since then. The island is now home to an educational retreat center. Description Yukon Island is a heavily wooded island, about wide and long. It has a rocky shoreline with steep, eroding cliffs, and a rugged interior forested with sitka spruce and hemlock. Its highest point has an elevation of about . The island subsided by about as a result of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, resulting in significant erosion along its shores.National Historic Landmark nomination for Yukon Island Main Site (redacted); available by request from the National Park Service. The island is located near the south shore of the mouth of Kachemak Bay, an inlet on the east side of Cook Inlet. The bay is a biologically rich environment in comparison to Cook Inlet and the outer shores of the Kenai Peninsula. Its location is of strategic benefit to small craft negotiating the coastline. Archaeology The Main Site on the island was discovered in 1924, at which time ancient female human remains were discovered in an eroding shell midden. The site was investigated in depth by Frederica de Laguna in the 1930s, as a result of which she was able to construct a 1500-year chronology of use. Her work laid the foundation for later research in the region, which has largely confirmed her initial timeline. This site has been a regular subject of archaeological research; it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. This site was particularly affected by the 1964 earthquake, and is subject to erosion. A detailed survey of the island identified five additional midden sites in 1976. One of these, designated SEL-041, has a midden deep, with historical refuse on top of it. The midden is part of what is interpreted as a village site, which has yielded radio carbon dates of CE 1100‚Äì1300. Yukon Island Center The Yukon Island Center is an educational retreat center located on a small portion of the island. Built on land cleared in the 1970s, its construction and opening were delayed by the discovery of archaeological sites at its planned location. Opened in 1991, it hosts education groups of 50‚Äì60 people.

It was given away as a free download single from the band's official website on Christmas Day 2007. The song was conceived as a Christmas single as part of the band's plans to make a \\"pop record\\" in parent album Hey Venus! The title stems from sessions in 2004 for the extended live version of \\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\\", at which the group's engineer repeatably used the phrase. Critical response to \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" was generally positive with the NME claiming it to be one of the best songs on Hey Venus! and BBC Wales describing the track as \\"brain-bendingly catchy\\". A Team D.A.D.D.Y. directed music video was made to accompany the track's release as a single. The video features a spoilt child being showered with Christmas presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts. Two different endings for the video were produced - in one Santa Claus is shown crucified on a cross while another sees Santa laid on the floor with an arrow through his head.  Origins and recording  In a 2008 interview with Uncut singer Gruff Rhys stated that \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" was written as an \\"AOR Christmas single\\" following a visit to Japan where \\"they celebrate Christmas as a commercial holiday with all the decorations .. in one store they had Santa on a cross hanging from the wall ... so the Christmas single was just an excuse to have Santa on a cross on the cover\\". Although the cover art did not in the end feature this scene, a crucified Santa does appear in the accompanying music video. Speaking to British music magazine Artrocker Rhys offered another explanation as to the origins of the song: The track was recorded at Miraval Studios, France along with the rest of Hey Venus!  Musical structure  \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" is 3 minutes 20 seconds long and is in the key of D minor. The track begins with a phased guitar melody backed only by synthesizer, hi-hat and occasional guitar chords. Cian Ciaran's piano joins the mix as the song builds up with the introduction of drums at 25 seconds. Gruff Rhys begins singing after 39 seconds and is joined by sleighbells which accompany the lines \\"all the bells started ringing\\" shortly before the first chorus which features harmony backing vocals (the first of many in the \\"falsetto-laden\\" track) singing the title phrase. Another verse and chorus follow before an instrumental verse at 1 minute 46 seconds featuring a trumpet solo playing around the vocal melody. The song \\"crescendos tenderly\\" with a double chorus before entering the outro which initially includes spoken word backing vocals chanting \\"giving again\\" and is \\"enhanced by a horn section that the Furries seem to be able to utilise more effectively than anyone else\\".  Critical response  Critical reaction to \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" was generally positive with the New Musical Express rating it as one of the best on parent album Hey Venus!; \\"[it doesn't so much raise] the bar, as balances it on top of Mount Snowdon\\" going on to state: \\"From a foundation of ELO guitar cloud-swells, Gruff's Elvis Costello-in-a-bubblegum- bath voice wraps around tender trombone parps to create the band's most beautiful moment since \\"Demons\\". BBC Wales commented on the track's Christmas links, describing \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" as a \\"mellow, mellifluous, slow ode to the joys of the festive season ... lyrically incredibly simple ... brain-bendingly catchy\\". The Guardian meanwhile, stated that the song \\"might sound more California than Christmas\\" but still possesses the \\"obligatory sleighbells ... shaken throughout\\". Much was made of the 'retro' nature of the track with Yahoo Music UK claiming that the song is \\"a pure blue-eyed soul tune, of the sort that Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham used to churn out four decades ago\\" and The Guardian describing it as a \\"gorgeous, Bacharach-tinged haze\\". In contrast the UCSD Guardian described \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" as \\"jazzy\\" and \\"lo-fi\\" and saw it as \\"a throw-back to 2000's experimental Mwng\\". Billboard noted that \\"the group's penchant for sonic flourishes is used to subtle effect\\" on \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" and went on to suggest that the track is representative of Hey Venus! as a whole. Cokemachineglow, however, thought that the song \\"will be cast into the void, one daring, lonely piece of the first Super Furry Animals album to not succeed as a thorough unit\\" and, in their single review of \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\", the NME suggested that the track wasn't one of the group's best. The band's decision to employ Japanese surrealist Keiichi Tanaami to produce the cover for Hey Venus! and its singles received some criticism, not least because the artist had already used similar designs. In a 2005 interview with German magazine Komakino, keyboard player Cian Ciaran stated that the artwork for \\"The Gift...\\" was unique, however, and praised the artist.  Music video  One ending of the music video features Santa Claus crucified on a cross. The video for \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" was directed by Team D.A.D.D.Y. and revolves around a festive theme in keeping with the track's release date of Christmas day. The video opens with a spoilt child opening numerous Christmas presents including a toy train, a box full of kittens and a copy of Hey Venus! (which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before we cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow through his head. Despite the apparently cynical nature of the video, BBC Wales asserts that it is \\"not meant to be read in any deeper level than 'ain't Christmas brilliant?'\\"  Track listing  All songs by Super Furry Animals. *# \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" ‚Äì 3:20 Although the track was initially reported to come with an \\"exclusive b-side\\" this turned out not to be the case and only \\"The Gift That Keeps Giving\\" was made available.

Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s, primarily in Germany and the Netherlands,Bob Lodewijks and Ronald Elink Schuurman, De Amsterdamse School in Utrecht (2014). where the style was created. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of Northern Germany and the Ruhr area, but the Amsterdam School belongs to the same movement, which can be found in many of the larger Dutch cities like Amsterdam and Utrecht.Bob Lodewijks and Ronald Elink Schuurman, De Amsterdamse School in Utrecht (2014). The style also had some impact outside the areas mentioned. Style Brick Expressionism developed at the same time as the \\"New Objectivity\\" of Bauhaus architecture. But whereas the Bauhaus architects argued for the removal of all decorative elements, or ornaments, expressionist architects developed a distinctive form or ornamentation, often using rough, angular or pointy elements. They were meant to express the dynamic of the period, its intensity and tension. The most important building materials were the eponymous bricks and clinker bricks. Hard-fired clinker was very fashionable, especially for facades. That material was especially well adapted to the difficult environmental requirements of industrial buildings, particularly in the Ruhr area. Its characteristic rough surface and rich variety of colours, from brown via red to purple, also contributed to the material's popularity. A striking feature of Brick Expressionism is the liveliness of its facades, achieved purely through the deliberate setting of bricks in patterns. This helped to enliven large, otherwise monotonous, walls. In some cases, even brick wasters (pieces that had been damaged during firing, or had been fired too long, or not long enough, leading to uneven or undesired colouring) were used as decorative elements, exploiting their individual appearance. The angular bricks were combined in various arrangements, creating a rich ornamental repertoire, including specific forms of sculpture. Horizontal brick courses that alternate between protruding and being slightly recessed are another common feature, e.g. on the Hans-Sachs-Haus in Gelsenkirchen (1927). The facade designs were enhanced by the use of architectural sculpture, made of clinker bricks or ceramics. A well-known representative of this form of art was Richard Ku√∂hl. Ernst Barlach also created clinker statues, such as the frieze Gemeinschaft der Heiligen (\\"community of saints\\") on St. Catherine's in L√ºbeck (completed by Gerhard Marcks). Occasionally, elements from other architectural styles were referenced, translated into the brick repertoire of forms. For example, Fritz H√∂ger's Chilehaus in Hamburg is dominated by Art Deco aesthetics. The Anzeigerhochhaus in Hanover quotes oriental architecture. Brick Expressionism also created its very own, often quite idiosyncratic forms, such as Parabola Churches (Parabel-Kirchen), e.g. the Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche at Gelsenkirchen- √úckendorf. Image:Klinkerfassade.jpgClinker bricks Image:Boettcherstrasse06a.jpgBricks set to form a complex pattern, B√∂ttcherstrasse, Bremen Image:Anzeigerhochhaus nachts Baustelle.jpgAnzeiger- Hochhaus in Hanover, 51m, built in 1928 by Fritz H√∂ger Northern Germany Some outstanding examples of Brick Expressionism are found in Hamburg. Here, Fritz H√∂ger created the highly innovative Chilehaus, with its pronounced vertically oriented design and near-playful use of material. Other examples are the neighbouring Sprinkenhof (by Hans und Oskar Gerson and H√∂ger), the Broschekhaus and the Zigarettenfabrik Reemtsma (Reemtsma cigarette factory). Another important Northern German representative of the style was Fritz Schumacher. He created numerous public buildings in Hamburg, such as the financial offices on the G√§nsemarkt, the crematorium at Ohlsdorf Cemetery, the Waldd√∂rfer-Gymnasium secondary school in Volksdorf and the Jarrestadt school. B√∂ttcherstrasse at Bremen is a further important example of the style in Northern Germany.

The material could withstand difficult industrial conditions and permitted the creation of well-balanced and varied facade designs with relatively little effort. Hard-fired clinker was comparatively expensive, so many buildings were designed with part-clinkered and part-whitewashed facades. Examples were created all over the Ruhr, including industrial architecture (assembly halls, office buildings, water towers, etc.) and residential buildings. Brick was also used for representative buildings, such as town halls, post offices, churches and villas. An important example is Alfred Fischer's Hans-Sachs-Haus in Gelsenkirchen, planned as multi-functional a building but eventually used as the city hall. Its comparatively simply brick facade and rounded corners characterise it as a synthesis between expressionism and New Objectivity. Also in Gelsenkirchen, in the √úckendorf area, is the main work of Josef Franke, the Parabola Church of Heilig-Kreuz (Holy Cross). Its vault has the shape of a tall parabola. The top of the square tower is crowned by a brick-built figure of Christ. The church was deconsecrated on 18 August 2007. Other important Brick Expressionist buildings in the Ruhr area are the police headquarters, Bert-Brecht-Haus and city hall in Oberhausen, Alfred Fischer's offices for the Regionalverband Ruhrgebiet (regional development authority) in Essen, the BOGESTRA building and the police headquarters in Bochum, and the pediatric surgery ward of Dortmund city hospital.

Thomas Memorial Library, also known as the North Star Borough Library is a historic former library building at 901 1st Avenue in Fairbanks, Alaska. Built in 1909 with funding from philanthropist George C. Thomas, this log building served Fairbanks as its public library until 1977, when the Noel Wien Public Library was opened. This building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978 as the site of a key conference in 1915 between Alaska Native leaders and federal government representatives, at which the Native leaders pressed a number of issues, including the long-running matter of native land claims, which would not be resolved until the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. and Description and history The Thomas Library building is a square log structure with a hip roof that extends over a porch on two sides. The porch is supported by six log columns on each side, and the building's main entrance is located at the corner under the porch. Construction of the building was funded by George C. Thomas, a Philadelphia philanthropist who was interested in the missionary work of the Episcopal Church, which had been providing limited library services to Fairbanks since 1904. The building was dedicated on August 5, 1909. The building and library collection were sold to the city of Fairbanks for $1 in 1940, on the condition the building always house a library. The Fairbanks North Star Borough took over operation of the library in 1968. Since the library was moved to new quarters in 1977, the building has seen commercial use. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. The latter designation was made in recognition of a significant event in the history of Alaska. On July 5 and 6, 1915, a delegation of Alaska Native leaders met with a committee of United States Government officials and representatives of the Alaska Territory to discuss a variety of concerns. Although the issues ranged to matters of employment, education, the major issue was that of native land claims, which were a significant cloud on many land transactions in the territory. The meeting marked the beginning of a lengthy struggle by the natives for recognition which culminated in the passage in 1971 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, landmark legislation granting them sweeping rights and compensation.

The strength of a wooden box is rated based on the weight it can carry before the cap (top, ends, and sides) is installed. \\"Skids\\" or thick bottom runners, are sometimes specified to allow forklift trucks access for lifting. Performance is strongly influenced by the specific design, type of wood, type of fasteners (nails, etc.), workmanship, etc. Some boxes have handles, hand holes, or hand holds. Ammunition in wooden boxes, steel strapping Nailed wood box=Cleated box= A cleated box has five or six panel faces with wood strips attached to them. The panels can be made of plywood, solid or corrugated fiberboard, etc. Wooden cleats reinforce the panels. =Wirebound box= Very thin lumber is used for a wirebound box. Wires are stapled or stitched to the girth and to wood cleats. These are sometimes used for produce and for heavy loose items for military or export use. These are lighter than wood boxes or crates.

Mission Provides global Special Air Mission (SAM) airlift, logistics, aerial port and communications for the President, Vice President, Combat Commanders, senior leaders and the global mobility system as tasked by the White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Air Mobility Command. History Established under Air Transport Command in 1944 to provide aerial transportation in China-Burma-India Theater from May 1944‚ÄìMay 1945 and in Western Pacific from c. September‚ÄìDecember 1945. The unit was equipped first with the Curtiss C-46 Commando, and then converted to the Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express in 1944. Re-established under Military Air Transport Service in November 1953, providing airlift of personnel and equipment initially flying Douglas C-54 Skymasters. Converted to long range Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs and provided long range heavy strategic transport on a global scale. In 1960 converted to the Douglas C-133 Cargomaster and provided very heavy strategic airlift until the end of the C-133's service in 1971. Reactivated in 1977 at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland and assigned to the Special Air Mission supporting transportation for the President and other high-ranking dignitaries of US and foreign governments, and Beechcraft C-12 Huron training for personnel from all branches of the military in 1977. At Andrews, has operated a variety of aircraft including the McDonnell Douglas VC-9 Skytrain II, C-12, Boeing VC-135 Stratolifter, Lockheed VC-140 JetStar, Boeing VC-137 and Gulfstream C-20.

The corvette remained in service until being broken up in 1947. Origin La Malouine was one of four Flower- class corvettes ordered by the Marine Nationale. Only two of these were delivered to the Marine Nationale. One of these ships was La Malouine, the other . On completion by Smiths Dock Co. Ltd La Malouine sailed for Portsmouth for fitting out. It was here that she was commissioned into the Marine Nationale in June 1940. However, France surrendered to Germany on 22 June 1940. As a consequence of this event La Malouine was seized by the Royal Navy on 3 July 1940 and subsequently commissioned into the Royal Navy, by Lt. Cdr. R.W Keymer RN, on 29 July 1940. Throughout the remainder of the war La Malouine flew both the Tricolore and the White Ensign.

On 5 May, during an air raid on Belfast, Northern Ireland, La Malouine was damaged by a near miss and lost two of her crew killed. This required several weeks of repair. By July she was back on active service joining convoy SL81 out of Freetown. This convoy lost six ships, including Kumasian to on 5 August 1941. La Malouine picked up 59 of the Kumasian survivors. During 1941 La Malouine escorted 10 convoys. Between January and May 1942 La Malouine was involved in 4 convoys. In February 1942 she was at Gibraltar in company with the corvettes, , , and .

After PQ 17 to 1945 Following her return from Russia, in September 1942, La Malouine found herself back in the Mediterranean undertaking 4 more convoys before the end of the year. 1943 began with La Malouine escorting convoy KMS.6G during which, on 6 January, east of Algiers, the merchant vessel Benalbanach was lost along with approximately 400 lives. The period from January to June 1943 was spent escorting convoys from Freetown to Liverpool. Whilst escorting convoy OS.45, on 2 April, La Malouine picked up some of the 53 survivors from the torpedoed merchant vessel Katha, west of Oporto.

Caprese in Tuscany, 30 Jan., 1787; d. Noventa Padovana, 26 June 1877) was an Italian astronomer and mathematician. He received his first instruction from his parental uncle, the Abbot Giovanni Battista Santini. After finishing his philosophical studies in the school year 1801-2, at the seminary of Prato, he entered in 1802 the University of Pisa. He very soon abandoned the study of law in order to devote himself, under the direction of Prof. Paoli and Abbot Pacchiano, exclusively to mathematics and the natural sciences. It appears that at Pisa, Santini still wore the cassock, with the consequence that in bibliographical dictionaries he still figures under the title of abate. It is certain, however, that he never received major orders. In 1810 he married Teresa Pastrovich, and one year after her death, in 1843, he contracted a second marriage with Adriana Conforti, who outlived him. During his stay in Pisa he became friendly with the rector of the university and of the influential Vittorio Fossombroni. At their urgent suggestion Santini's family, especially his uncle, made great sacrifices to enable him to continue his studies in Milan (1805‚Äì1806) under Barnaba Oriani, Cesaris, and Francesco Carlini. On 17 Oct., 1806, the Italian Government appointed him assistant to the director of the observatory at Padua, Abate Chiminello, whom he succeeded in 1814. In 1813 the university offered him the chair of astronomy, a position in which he was confirmed by the Emperor Francis I in 1818 after the Venetian territory had become part of Austria. In addition he taught for several years, as substitute, elementary algebra, geometry, and higher mathematics. During the school years 1824-1825 and 1856-1857 he was rector of the university, and from 1845 to 1872 director of mathematical studies. Towards the end of 1873 he suffered repeatedly from fainting spells which were followed by a steadily increasing physical and mental weakness and final breakdown. He died in his ninety-first year at his villa, Noventa Padovana. Astronomical work Both as a practical and theoretical astronomer, Santini made the Observatory of Padua famous. When he took charge the observatory was located in an old fortified tower, in a reportedly precarious condition, but he refurbished it. In 1811 he determined the latitude of Padua with the aid of Gauss's method of three stars in the same altitude, and in 1815 again, with a new repeating circle. In 1822, '24, and '28 he assisted the astronomical and geodetic service of Italy by making observations in longitude. Constantly striving to equip this institute in accordance with the latest requirements of science, he installed in 1823 a new Utzschneider equatorial, and in 1837 a new meridian circle. With these last he began at once to make zonal observations for a catalogue of stars between declination +10¬∞ and -10¬∞, an undertaking which he carried out on a large scale, and which he, with the aid of his assistant, Trettenero, completed in 1857, after ten years of work. In 1843 he made a scientific journey through Germany, and meeting scientists in his own and related fields. In the Encke- Galle catalogue he is credited with the calculation of nineteen comet orbits. He acquired his greatest repute by his calculations of the orbital disturbances during the period from 1832-1852 caused by the great planets on the comet of Biela. The time and place of the appearance of this comet in 1846 corresponded exactly with previous calculations. In 1819-20 he published his Elementi di Astronomia (2nd ed., Padua, 1830), a work in two parts. In 1828 appeared his Teorica degli Stromenti Ottici, also published in Padua, in which he explains by means of simple formulas the construction of the different kinds of telescopes, microscopes etc. A number of his dissertations on geodetic and astronomic subjects appeared in the annals of learned associations, in the Correspondence du Baron de Zach, Astronomische Nachrichten, etc. Besides some twenty Italian scientific societies, Santini became a member in 1825 of the London Royal Astronomical Society; in 1845 a corresponding member of the Institut de France; and in 1847 member of the Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften of Vienna. When in 1866 Venice was separated from Austria, he became a corresponding member of the last-named association. Danish, Austrian, Spanish, and Italian decorations were bestowed upon him.

It is located about 20 km south-west of Hastings, New Zealand, close to the settlement of Te Hauke. It is the largest lake lying within a peatland in the active tectonic Poukawa depression (or Poukawa Basin), between the Raukawa Range and Kaokaoroa Range of central Hawke's Bay. Its maximal depth is less than one metre and its diameter is ca. 1.5 km. It was deeper in the past (about 2.5 metre) but it became artificially drained after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. Lake Poukawa became a well-known paleontological site in 1956 when paleontologist Russell Price began with his excavations in the lacustrine deposits. Lake Poukawa had a species rich Pleistocene/Holocene waterfowl fauna. More than 13,400 anatid bones were unearthed at this site since 1956. Extinct birds found at Lake Poukawa include Biziura delautouri, Oxyura vantetsi, Mergus australis, Chenonetta finschi, Pachyornis geranoides, Ixobrychus novaezelandiae, Gallinula hodgenorum, Fulica prisca, Malacorhynchus scarletti, and Cnemiornis gracilis. Twelve km south of Lake Poukawa is the Te Aute swamp which is known for its moa fossils and tracks. Lake Poukawa is drained by the Poukawa Stream, which flows north- eastward through the Pekapeka Wetland and eventually into the Clive River. References *Worthy, T. H.

It was the manor house for the moiety of the Tonge with Haulgh township held by the Brownlows in the 16th century. The original building is timber framed and has a stone flagged roof; there were later additions to the house, built from stone, in 1591 and 1648. The name represents \\"Hall in the Wood' spoken in the local regional English dialect and is pronounced . The house was not used as a gentry house but rather given over to multiple occupation by families engaged in industry. Four (previously five) separate dwellings can be identified, each with its own entrance and staircase. One part was let to Samuel Crompton during the 18th century, where he designed and built the first spinning mule. About 1779, Crompton succeeded in producing a mule-jenny, a machine which spun yarn suitable for use in the manufacture of muslin. It was known as the muslin wheel or the Hall i' th' Woodwheel from the name of the house. Hall i' th' Wood was bought by William Lever (later Lord Leverhulme) in 1899 and was restored by Jonathan Simpson and Edward Ould. Lever gave the house to the Corporation of Bolton in 1900.

It rises on the North York Moors and flows south to join the River Rye, itself a tributary of the River Derwent. The upper valley of the river is known as Farndale. The name is of Brittonic Celtic origin, meaning \\"dark river\\". Its principal tributary is the Hodge Beck. Course The river flows through Farndale south-east past several small settlements to Church Houses. Here it turns south and continues meandering past Low Mill to Lowna. At Gillamoor it heads south-east again past Hutton-le-Hole before returning southwards past Ravenswick and to the east of Kirkbymoorside. It continues past Keldholme and Kirkby Mills to Great Edstone. From there it flows south south-east to where it joins the River Rye in the Vale of Pickering near the village of Salton. The Environment Agency have a gauging station at Kirkby Mills where the average low river level is and the high river level with a record high level of . The record high level shows the river can be susceptible to flooding. Geography Both the River Dove and Hodge Beck are partly swallowed by the local limestone aquifer and issue again further down the valley. During summer months the bed of Hodge Beck often runs dry. The soil in the valley floor is loam over clay. The bedrock is Jurassic limestone with some sandstone. Leisure Between Church Houses and Low Mill in Farndale, the River Dove is popular with walkers due to its picturesque setting. The banks of the river are known for their wild daffodils which are rumoured to have been planted by monks from nearby Rievaulx Abbey. Along this part of the valley is The Farndale Daffodil Walk, an circular walk starting at Lowna Bridge. In literature William Wordsworth's poem, She dwelt among the untrodden ways from the Lucy series of poems refers to the eponymous Lucy living close to the \\"springs of Dove\\", a possible reference to the source of the river, but could equally pertain to the either the River Dove in Derbyshire or in Westmorland, as Wordsworth knew of all three of them.

This method of ground improvement is also called vibro replacement. Such techniques increase the load bearing capacity and drainage of the soil while reducing settlement and liquefaction potential. Stone columns are made across the area to be improved in a triangular or rectangular grid pattern. They have been used in Europe since the 1950s, and in the United States since the 1970s. Column depth depends on local soil strata, and usually penetrates weak soil. During construction, a vibrating tool suspended from a crane penetrates to the design depth by means of its own weight and vibrations. Predrilling may be required in dense soil or may be used to reduce the amount of ground displacement during installation. Crushed stone is introduced into the hole by one of two methods. In the dry bottom method, a pipe attached to the vibrator supplies stone directly to it. In the wet top method, water jets located in the vibrator's tip create an annular space around the vibrator through which stone is introduced from the top. The vibrating probe breaks down the pores of the surrounding soil, thereby densifying the soil. The stone that is poured in takes the place of the soil and keeps up the pressure on the soil that was created by the vibrating probe. The stone consists of crushed coarse aggregates of various sizes. The ratio in which the stones of different sizes will be mixed is decided by design criteria. Spacing and diameter of columns are also determined by design criteria.

When telephony call streams started to be digitized for time-division-multiplexed (TDM) transport, processing of the media stream, to enhance it in some way, became common. For example, digital echo cancellers were added to long-haul circuits, and transport channels were shaped to improve modem performance. Then, in the mid-‚Äò80s, computer-based systems that implemented messaging, for example, used DSPs to compress the audio for storage, and fax servers used DSPs to implement fax modems. However, since the late ‚Äò90s, the millions of instructions per second (MIPS) of processing power available on low-cost PCs have been adequate to process several media streams, while still leaving enough processing power to handle the application. And, following Moore‚Äôs Law, PC capacity continues to double every 18 months, while the MIPS required to process a call‚Äôs media stream have remained relatively constant. Now, in the latter half of the century‚Äôs first decade, a single PC can handle well over 100 simultaneous calls. Prior to IP telephony, when you wanted to connect a telecommunications system to a telecom network it was necessary to have a telecom-specific physical interface. This could mean an analog interface (POTS/DS-0), for low-density non-network systems, or a digital interface, such as a T-1 or E-1 line (DS-1, delivering 24 or 32 DS-0s). A DS-4 connection delivers 274.176 Mbit/s or 4032 DS-Os. In each case, telecom-specific electronic interfaces, which were proprietary and, therefore, relatively expensive, were necessary. The situation changes dramatically with an all-IP telecom infrastructure. The network interfaces move from being a significant proprietary component to off-the-shelf high-performance IP interfaces, an inherent feature in every modern computing system. Today, 10-Gigabit Ethernet' telephony systems are being deployed. The term Host Media Processing was first used in a product name by Intel in the early 2000s. It was quickly adopted as a generic term for software-based telephony products, used by many companies including Aculab, Pika, Eicon Networks, Uniqall, Commetrex, and NMS. Intel's Host Media Processing product line (still called HMP) exists today under the Dialogic banner. The concept of using an industry standard PC to do telephony processing is now widely understood and accepted, with open-source platforms like Asterisk, YATE and FreeSWITCH using the same principle. The rise of interest in VoIP and Fax-over-IP (FoIP) have driven demand for open, host- based solutions that can be molded into a variety of different communications solutions. HMP components are used today to implement many different kinds of solutions including PBX, conference servers, unified communications servers and IVR. The emergence of virtualization in recent years also increases the appeal of HMP, since it is then possible to think of telephony resources as being virtual channels (rather than dedicated hardware boards), which offer the same benefit as virtual processors and servers, i.e. resilience; less hardware; space saving; lower maintenance. Network connectivity through low- cost industry-standard interfaces influences the consideration of whether to use DSPs or server blades for media processing, especially in media servers, where packet-delays are not as troublesome and TDM interfaces are not required. Without telephony interface blades and their attendant chassis and power systems available to host the DSPs, the addition of DSPs on proprietary blades must be independently justified. They will continue to be justified for the highest-density applications. However, with the semiconductor industry continuing to follow Moore‚Äôs law, host media processing will support 1500 channels on one blade in 2010. DSPs will always offer even higher densities, but if 1500 channels meets the system requirement, higher densities will have little incremental value. Not every use of the term ‚ÄúHMP‚Äù means the same thing. There are, for example, HMP systems that do no actual media processing, so it is important to understand how the term is being used today. Modern digital-media telephony systems require signal processing to transform a call stream or extract information from it. Transformation includes the processing required to send or receive a fax and to transcode the stream from one speech codec to another for capability matching or bandwidth reduction. DTMF detection, caller ID, and in-band call-progress analysis are good examples of information extraction. There are many limited-function media servers on the market that don‚Äôt actually do any media (signal) processing. There is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) ‚ÄúRFC‚Äù (2833) http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2833.html that defines how a gateway can perform the in-band-tone analysis to extract some of the embedded information, such as DTMF and caller ID. In this case, all the media server need do is parse the RTP buffers from a gateway to derive the tone information. But what about transcoding, where one voice-compression scheme (vocoder) it transcoded to another? Some media servers, for example, simply process buffers, and, therefore, cannot perform any transcoding, limiting them to low-function voice messaging. RTP packets are simply stored and played back as they are received. This means no AGC, volume control, time-scale modification (playback speedup and slowdown), or capabilities matching with endpoint terminals, making this type of so-called HMP media server a viable option only in the most functionally constrained applications. For years, the terms ‚Äúsignal processing‚Äù and ‚Äúmedia processing‚Äù have been used interchangeably, so, most appropriately, the term HMP is reserved for those systems where host MIPS are actually used to perform digital signal-processing tasks.

The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for its association with the early settlement of Altadena. (site #97000751). The house has notably featured in films such as Hocus Pocus (Allison's house interior shots), Matilda (Trunchbull's house), Scream 2 (Omega Beta Zeta sorority house) and Catch Me If You Can (Roger Strong's house). History=Eliza Griffin Johnston= The Crank House sits on land, the Fair Oaks Ranch, once owned by Eliza Griffin Johnston, the widow of Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston. Following the death of her husband at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, Eliza and her children came to Southern California at the urging of her brother, Dr. John S. Griffin. Griffin had large land holdings in the Los Angeles area and was a business partner of Benjamin D. Wilson in Rancho San Pascual. Wilson was a local land speculator, politician, and also the maternal grandfather of General George S. Patton. Dr. Griffin sold Eliza Griffin Johnston the property for $1,000. Eliza Griffin Johnston named her ranch \\"Fair Oaks\\", after her native city in Virginia and also for the stands of Coast live oaks‚ÄîQuercus agrifloia in the area.Robert H. Peterson, Altadena's Golden Years, Alhambra, California: Sinclair Printing and Litho, Inc., 1976, p. 23. When Eliza's son, Albert II, was killed in a steamship boiler explosion at Wilmington, California in 1864, she left California and returned to Virginia. The ranch was taken over by Benjamin Eaton, father of Frederick Eaton.Peterson, p. 23. Benjamin Eaton subdivided the ranch. The southern portion was bought by the Ellises. =James F. Crank= Another view of the house The northern portion was bought by James F. Crank in 1876. Crank came from New York and was impressed with the land, and soon planted citrus orchards and vineyards. Eliza Johnston's simple wood-frame house was moved to another location on the property, and still stands at 2072 Oakwood Street, Altadena. Crank built a much larger, more palatial home in 1882.Peterson, p. 40. The house is a -story wood-frame Victorian mansion. In 1883, Crank invested in the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, becoming its president. The rail line ran from Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad was sold and consolidated on May 20, 1887 into the California Central Railway. In 1889 this was consolidated into Southern California Railway Company. On Jan. 17, 1906 Southern California Railway was sold to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and called the Pasadena Subdivision.Michele Zack, Altadena: Between Wilderness and City, Altadena, California: Altadena Historical Society, 2004, p. 68. Even so, Crank suffered financially, and sold the ranch. It was subdivided in 1910. He donated land for the Raymond Hotel in Pasadena, that had his Pasadena rail station.

In setting up the DCB, he introduced two of its distinctive features. The first was to organize the volumes of biographies in chronological rather than alphabetical order. The most significant feature of the DCB was its establishment in 1961 as a partnership between the University of Toronto Press and Laval University Press, with identical volumes published simultaneously in English and French. This collaboration continues to the present day, and the DCB has become one of the most significant scholarly undertakings in Canada.

Research and publications = Scholarly research = Brown was an active scholar in his own right and a prolific writer. His most enduring academic interest was the emergence of Canada as a society and political entity, initially in North America and then in the wider world.

In this view, the stereotypes, which are traced back to the work of earlier scholars on New France and primary sources, have the effect of constructing French Canadians in the negative image of the contemporary (post-World War II) English Canadian, thus detaching them from the main narrative of Canadian history. In response, the passages in question were an effort to depict daily life in New France to students and to balance more traditional accounts that focus on leading historical figures and events. Brown's later publication of Notre Histoire with Charles Bilodeau, a respected Quebec historian, and his work as founding editor of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, the leading collaborative effort in Canada between anglophone and francophone historians, are both reflections of his core belief that English and French Canada were founding partners.

Produced by Sarita Patra, and P. Prem Kumar, Starring Rajendra Prasad, Aamani in lead roles with music composed by R. P. Patnaik. The film received the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film (Gold), and was screened at the AISFM Film Festival. The film was later remade in Kannada in 2006 as Sirivantha starring Vishnuvardhan. Plot The film starts with two messengers of God (Chalapathi Rao, and Raghubabu) coming to take the life of Raghuram (Rajendra Prasad). He is a kind-hearted idealistic individual who spends half of his income on charity work. He works as the editor of a newspaper. When his managing director asks him to publish tabloid photos to increase circulation, he is ready to resign and sell Papads instead of losing his values. Later he realizes his mistake and reappoints Raghuram as the editor and promises him not to involve in his duty. His wife Bharati (Aamani), two sons Shekar (Raja) and Chinna (Ping Pong Surya) and a daughter Revathi are quite against his helping attitude. His children compel him to get money for their career (bribe for a job), education (donation fee for engineering seat) and settling in the United States which he feels is completely wrong.

Charles (1912), Porches & Fonts.Pub. Wells, Gardner, Darton & Co., Ltd., London. P. 66. Kirkdale is a valley in North Yorkshire, England, which along with Sleightholmedale makes up the larger Bransdale and carries the Hodge Beck from its moorland source near Cockayne to the River Dove and onto the River Rye in the Vale of Pickering. Corallian Limestone which outcrops on the hills surrounding the Vale of Pickering runs across the region, and this appears as an aquifer in Kirkdale swallowing most of the water from Hodge Beck, which reappears further downstream. During summer months the river bed often runs dry as most of the water takes a subterranean passage. Kirkdale is noted for a bone cave, an ancient animal den, into which scavengers such as hyenas dragged the remains of many other animals. Numerous bones can still be found in the cave today.  History  Although there is no village in the dale, Kirkdale was the centre of a large ancient parish. The Saxon parish church of St Gregory's Minster stands by the river. It was built in 1055 on the site of an earlier church, and has an 11th-century sundial bearing an Old English inscription. The church gave its name to the dale, first recorded in the Domesday Book and derived from the Old Norse kirkja dalr (meaning \\"church valley\\"). The parish was composed of the townships of Beadlam, Bransdale Westside, Muscoates, Nawton, North Holme, Skiplam, Welburn (which included the site of the parish church) and Wombleton. North Holme was transferred to the parish of Great Edstone in the 19th century. All these townships became separate civil parishes in 1866.Vision of Britain website Aerial view of Gregory's Minster in Kirkdale Aerial view of Kirkdale looking north towards Bransdale.

It is located in Genesee County between Buffalo and Rochester just off of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90). It opened on September 20, 1940, and is the oldest lighted harness racetrack in the United States. The track is exactly long. History In 1939, William \\"Lefty\\" Goldberg and others chose Batavia, halfway between Buffalo and Rochester, for par-mutuel wagering on horse races. Harold Wishman, William Zimmer, Arthur Martin and Frederick Strohm were stockholders in the Monroe-Genesee Breeders Association, a predecessor to the Genesee-Monroe Racing Association, which rented the Genesee County Fairgrounds for racing. =1940s= In 1940, Batavia Downs opened pari- mutuel racing at 8:20 PM on September 20, 1940. Crowds of more than 2,500 attended and $10,411 was wagered on the first card. In 1941, Batavia Downs opened to an estimated crowd of about 4,000 and a handle of $20,231. Track lighting was improved. The season was cancelled in 1942 and 1943 because of war travel restrictions. In 1944, Pat E. Provenzano borrowed money and bought out stockholder William Weisman, a New York City attorney, for $15,000. Provenzano was elected president of the Genesee Monroe Racing Association. In 1947, Provenzano purchased the racetrack property for $150,000 after the Genesee County Agricultural Society's fair association went bankrupt. Proximity set the then-track record of 2:04. In 1948 she broke her own time record with a time of 1:59 3/5. =1950s= In 1959, Bye Bye Byrd beat Tar Boy and equaled the world record for a half-mile track, 159.2. Attendance for this race was 9,633. =1960s= In 1962, a fire devastated the stables, killing a caretaker, 26 horses, and causing an estimated $625,000 in damages, not including lost revenues. The Downs underwent extensive renovations to prevent fires. In 1963, Batavia Downs welcomed its eight millionth visitor. In 1964, the grandstand was enclosed in glass. In 1966, Bret Hanover down under Cardigan Bay set a track record of 1:58.1. Batavia Downs enjoyed its biggest crowd at the time, as 15,228 came to watch and wagered $515,334. In 1968, Downs General Manager Herm Grannis was elected president of Harness Tracks of America, where he established the Harness Tracks Security. In 1970, Batavia Downs was honored by the Genesee County Chamber of Commerce for spreading the name and fame of Batavia all over the United States. =1970s= In 1970, Batavia Downs honored by the Genesee County Chamber of Commerce for spreading the name and fame of Batavia all over the United States In 1972, New York State legislation created off-track betting to bail New York City out of near bankruptcy. In 1973, the Western Regional Off-Track Betting Corporation was formed. Batavia Downs and Buffalo Raceway changed operations in 1975 to a single season from the split-season racing. Pat Provenzano, longtime president of the Downs, and John O. Marra, Executive Vice-President, were indicted for alleged tax evasion charges in 1976. Provenzano pleads no contest and was fined $10,000. Provenzano died the next year on September 9 at age 76. In 1977, Double-Gaited Excalibur, owned by Batavia driver, Fred Haslip and driven by Elba farmer Paul Zambito Jr. set a world record.

Later that year, Getting Personal won the New York Sire Stake event and broke the track record 1:53.3. In 1994, Batavia Downs became the first track in New York history to have its license revoked by racing authorities. This was due to a contract dispute with horseman. In 1997, the track held a shorter meet, only 28 days. Live racing ended. In 1998, Western OTB bought the track for $2.48 million. The next year, Western OTB and Buffalo Raceway officials agreed that the Erie County track would support Western's bid to obtain a racing license, in exchange for Western paying an annual sum for five years. =2000s= In 2000, opposition from other racetracks in the state and a leadership battle in the State Assembly prevented legislation from being passed to allow Off-Track Betting Corporation (OTB) to run a track. In 2001, simulcasting opened under direction of OTB. That same year, a bill passed allowing Western OTB to apply for a harness racing license. Batavia Downs reopened on July 29, 2002 under the direction of Western OTB with over $10 million in renovations. It welcomed over 6,000 in attendance. Later that year the first ever Robert J.

It was built in the 12th and 13th centuries and incorporates elements of Viking tradition from the prior 11th century church. The church combines the influences of Celtic art, Viking traditions, and Romanesque architecture. The woodwork, originating from the previous church, depicts interlaced, fighting animals, and thus links the pre- Christian Nordic culture and the Christianity of the medieval ages. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Bryggen  alt=Bryggen houses, look from the street.

Family Irene was a daughter of despotƒìs Demetrios Palaiologos and his wife Theodora. Her paternal grandparents were Andronikos II Palaiologos and his second wife Irene of Montferrat. The paternal uncles of Irene included Michael IX Palaiologos and Theodore I, Marquess of Montferrat. Her maternal aunts included Simonida. Empress On 26 October 1341, her father-in-law John VI was crowned emperor at Didymoteicho. His rival John V Palaiologos reigned from Constantinople. The civil war between them lasted until 1347. On 3 February 1347, the two sides reached an agreement. John VI was accepted as senior emperor with John V as his junior co-ruler. On 15 April 1353, Matthew was declared co-emperor and the conflict between John V and John VI restarted over what was seen as an attempt of John VI to secure his succession. Irene became thus the third Empress consort along with her mother- in-law Irene Asanina (wife of John VI) and sister-in-law Helena Kantakouzene (wife of John V). On 4 December 1354, John VI abdicated and he and Asanina retired to separate monasteries while John V secured control of Constantinople. Matthew was able to keep his title and part of Thrace as his own dominion. On February, 1356, he and Irene were captured by Serbian forces and remained in captivity until delivered to John V in December, 1357.

It is played like an ancient ud.\\" Researchers have found out that the first examples of the rud were made of gourds, and that the strings were made of silk and animal gut. It is remarkable that its appearance reminds one of a gourd. Its structure differs from that of other string instruments. Fish skin is pulled over half of the body's surface, and the other part is made of pine. Primarily, the instrument was played with the fingers; later it was played with the help of a plectrum made of soft material. The rud's body is made of mulberry wood and apricot wood, the neck and head are made of nut wood, and the pegs are made of pear wood. A total of 12 frets are fastened to the instrument's fret-board. The timbre of its sound is low. The total length of the instrument is 860 mm. The length of the body is 495 mm, the width is 335 mm and the height is 170 mm. The length of the neck is 285 mm.

They were tremendously popular throughout the Renaissance and Baroque periods and were considered luxury items. Today, the breed is rare, but has a loyal following. Stallions and mares undergo studbook inspections before being allowed to breed. They are most often chestnut with white markings. History The Royal Frederiksborg Stud was founded in 1562 under King Frederik II, who populated it with the Neapolitan horse and the Iberian forerunners of the Andalusian horse. As the Norfolk Roadster and Arab-bred horses gained popularity later on, they, too, were selected to stand at the royal stud. As a courtly mount, the Frederiksborg had to be agile and trainable for the courtiers' pursuits in haute ecole and warfare, stylish and high-stepping for parades and court ceremonies, and strong and uniform in appearance to trot before the royal carriages. By the 18th century, the Frederiksborger enjoyed such particular fame that the Danes began to export them in great numbers. They contributed to the formation of the heavy warmbloods, but also to the Lipizzaner. A grey Frederiksborger stallion born in 1765, Pluto, became a foundation stallion in the breed. The popularity of the breed took its toll, and in 1839, the royal stud was closed. The breeding of Frederiksborgers continued with private breeders, though the needs of the people reshaped the horse to some degree. Instead of a luxury item, the horses were redirected to be more suitable for the stagecoach and agricultural work. In 1939, efforts to re-establish the breed were started, adding East Friesian, Oldenburgs, Thoroughbreds, and Arabians later. The modern Danish Warmblood often traces back to the Frederiksborger through the female lines, though the pedigrees of these horses are mostly German. Nevertheless, as the Danish breeders made use of German and Swedish horses, some part-Frederiksborger mares made their way back into the breeding population. So to do the Holsteiner Manfreid (Markgraf), Swedish Rousseau (Herzog), and the Hanoverians Atlantic (Abglanz), Ergo (Abendjaeger), and Boheme (Bolero). Otherwise, the Frederiksborger has been purebred for the past century, which accounts for their uniform type. Characteristics Today, the numbers of Frederiksborgers are low, but the remaining examples are handsome horses. They are most often vividly marked flaxen chestnuts, though bays, buckskins, palominos, and greys are seen, as well. They usually have sabino-type markings and many have rabicano roaning, as well. In conformation and type, the Frederiksborger was \\"ahead of its time\\", so the horses express great quality and are quite uniform. The muzzle is wide and the straight lines of the head often border on convex. The neck is powerful and usually crested, and is set high on strong shoulders. The withers are not high, and the back, while long, has a strong loin. The hindquarters are broad and deep and the croup is level. The level topline and high-set neck of the Frederiksborger belie its showy trot. The legs are solid and square, a little more than half the horse's height. The tail is well-carried. The gaits of the Frederiksborger are expressive and powerful, with natural self-carriage. The trot is the best gait and is showy with a long stride. The walk is diligent and open, and the canter is sufficient. Most Frederiksborgers are willing jumpers, though calm-natured horses are less likely to be concerned about knocking rails. Uses Frederiksborgers are best in harness and compete up to the international levels of combined driving. They are also suitable horses for amateurs, as they are not selected for sensitivity. Some individuals are successful in competitive dressage and show jumping, as well. Medical issues Frederiksborgers are early-maturing, long-lived, and sound reproductively and structurally well into their old age. The greatest concern facing the health of the Frederiksborger is inbreeding due to a limited gene pool. However, studbook inspections are intended to safeguard the breed against weakness; a horse with a known genetic disorder is not approved to breed.

Plot The film begins on Divakaram (Rajendra Prasad) coming late to video-shoot a marriage, where he sees Bhuvaneswari(Shobana) and falls head over heels in love. He then gets hold of Bhuvaneswari's maternal uncle, V. P. Jagannatham (Pradeep Shakti) and gets information about Bhuvaneswari. He gathers that she respects only people who are self-sufficient and straightforward. He also finds out that she is not married and is about to get transferred to Rajahmundry (where he stays) soon. She works as a railway booking clerk. So Divakaram comes back to Rajahmundry and gets permission from the doctor (Shubha), who raises him as her foster child, to use the front veranda in her house for his video shop. In order to secure the capital, he uses all kinds of tricks. He blackmails Bhagyam [(Jayalalitha)], cheats Chinna Rao (Mallikarjuna Rao) and claims a chit which he never was a member of, and so on. Finally, starts the video shop. That's when Bhuvaneswari enters the scene. All the while Jagannatham writes him letters in her name, making Divakaram assume that she is in love with him. Finally, when she lands in Rajahmundry he approaches taking marriage proposals. It's then that he realizes that he had been cheated by Jagannatham. Meanwhile, she finds out all of Divakaram's mischief through the neighbors. To teach him a lesson, she puts forward a deal that she would marry him only if he stays out of cheating, and does not utter a lie in a month. Divakaram goes for it. Here we see all the problems of Divakaram gets into because of the deal he had with Bhuvaneswari. He discloses the murder done by his friend. This enrages his friend who comes out of jail as there is no proof of his murder. In the climax, his friend is killed and Divakaram goes to jail but is acquitted as Dr. Krupa Mani (Shubha) confesses to the murder as an act of self-defense and he comes back to win the hand of Bhuvaneswari.
