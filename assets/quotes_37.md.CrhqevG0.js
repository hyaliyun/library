Alter is the former chief of the infectious disease section and the associate director for research of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. In the mid-1970s, Alter and his research team demonstrated that most post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or hepatitis B viruses. Working independently, Alter and Edward Tabor, a scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, proved through transmission studies in chimpanzees that a new form of hepatitis, initially called \\"non-A, non-B hepatitis\\" caused the infections, and that the causative agent was probably a virus. This work eventually led to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus in 1988, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2020 along with Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice. Alter has received recognition for the research leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest award conferred to civilians in United States government public health service, and the 2000 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research.The Lasker Foundation  Early life and education  Alter was born in New York City in a Jewish family. He attended the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1956. In 1960, Alter obtained a medical degree from University of Rochester and began a residency at Strong Memorial. Alters's post graduate training includes a rotation as a clinical associate at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, from December 1961 to June 1964; a year of residency in medicine at University of Washington Hospital System, Seattle, Washington, from July 1964 to June 1965; and work as a hematology fellow at Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., from July 1965 to June 1966.  Career  Alter has a medical license issued by the District of Columbia. Additionally he holds certification by the American Board of Pathology blood banking subspecialty and is a fellow of the American College of Physicians. Clinical appointments include: director, hematology research at Georgetown University Hospital from July 1966 to June 1969; senior investigator in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH from July 1969 to present; chief of infectious diseases section at the department of transfusion medicine in the Clinical Center NIH from December 1972 to present; associate director for research at the department of transfusion medicine at the Clinical Center at NIH from January 1987 to present. Alter's academic appointments include: clinical associate professor of medicine at Georgetown University Hospital; Adjunct Professor at Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio, TX; clinical professor of medicine at Georgetown University Hospital; and a faculty position at Clinical Research Training Program at the NIH. Alter came to the NIH Clinical Center as a senior investigator in 1969. He remains at the NIH as a chief of the infectious diseases section and associate director of research in the department of transfusion medicine.  Medical research  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2020: Seminal experiments by HJ Alter, M Houghton and CM Rice leading to the discovery of HCV as the causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis. As a young research fellow in 1964, Alter co-discovered the Australia antigen with Baruch Blumberg. This work was a major factor in isolating the hepatitis B virus. Later, Alter led a Clinical Center project to store blood samples used to uncover the causes and reduce the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis. Based on his work, the United States started blood and donor screening programs that lowered the cause of hepatitis due to this risk from 30 percent in 1970 to nearly 0. In the mid-1970s, Alter and his research team demonstrated that most post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses. Work by Alter, in collaboration with Bob Purcell, and work by Edward Tabor working simultaneously in another laboratory, proved through transmission studies in chimpanzees that a new form of hepatitis, initially called \\"non-A, non-B hepatitis\\" caused the infections. This work eventually led to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus. In 1988 the new hepatitis virus was confirmed by Alter's group by verifying its presence in their stored panel of NANBH specimens.Alter.pdf In April 1989, the discovery of the non-A, non-B virus, renamed hepatitis C virus, was published in two articles in Science.  Honors and awards  Alter in 2000 Alter has received recognition for his research including the 2000 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for his work leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C. Alter and his co-awardee Michael Houghton were recognized for the development of blood screening methods that essentially eliminated the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis in the U.S. Other honors for his medical research include the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest award conferred to civilians in United States government public health service. Alter has been elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. In 2002 he received The International Society of Blood Transfusion Presidential Award. And in 2005, he received the American College of Physicians Award for Outstanding Work in Science as Related to Medicine, and the First International Prize of Inserm (the French equivalent of NIH). Speaking of Alter's long research career at the time of the 2000 Lasker Award, Harvey Klein, chief of the Clinical Center Transfusion Medicine Department noted, \\"As a young research fellow, Dr. Alter co-discovered the Australia antigen, a key to detecting Hepatitis B virus. For many investigators that would be the highlight of a career. For Dr. Alter it was only an auspicious beginning.\\"Clinical Center News October 2000 Alter was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine alongside Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice for \\"discoveries that led to the identification of [the] Hepatitis C virus.\\"  Personal life  He married Barbara Bailey; they have two children, Mark, also an MD, and Stacey, a teacher. He is currently married to Diane Dowling and has two step children, Lydia Rodin and Erinn Torres, and nine grandchildren.

He has been ITV's senior football commentator since the retirement of Brian Moore following the 1998 World Cup final. In that role, he has led the ITV commentary team at the subsequent four World Cups and four European Championships, and been lead commentator on the last 17 UEFA Champions League finals as well as taking the microphone at nine FA Cup finals for ITV. He won the prestigious Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2005, and was voted the Sony Radio Awards' Sports Broadcaster of the Year in 1983. Career Tyldesley was born in Radcliffe, Lancashire, and was educated at Bury Grammar School, Kirkham Grammar School and the University of Nottingham. He obtained an honours degree in Industrial Economics, but always wanted to pursue a career in sports commentating. In June 1975, he began his broadcast career straight from university with Radio Trent in Nottingham, where he became their regular Nottingham Forest reporter. In April 1977, he joined Radio City in Liverpool and remained there for the next 12 years. After succeeding Elton Welsby as City's sports editor, he covered the successes of Everton and Liverpool through the late 1970s and 1980s. Tyldesley was on-air at the scene of the Heysel disaster in 1985, but did not attend Liverpool's tragic FA Cup semi- final at Hillsborough in 1989. He was heavily involved in City's coverage of the aftermath of the disaster. Early ITV career For much of his radio career, Tyldesley had contributed match reports to ITV's World of Sport programme. In 1987, he began to work on \\"Sportsweek\\", a late night Granada Television sports programme featuring Welsby and Robert McCaffrey. During the next two years, Tyldesley began to split his working time between Radio City and Granada, who he eventually joined full-time in 1989. He became their main football commentator and also worked as a reporter and occasional presenter on their Kick Off and Granada Soccer Night programmes. Tyldesley's first television commentary was in August 1989, Liverpool v Manchester City on the opening day of the season. He became ITV's rugby league commentator in the north-west alongside Hull FC coach Brian Smith, and worked with Martin Tyler and Fred Trueman as a cricket commentator on Granada's coverage of Roses matches. Tyldesley's commentaries were now being broadcast on ITV network programmes, and he was chosen to be part of their commentary team at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. From 1989, he also became a regular reporter on 'Saint and Greavsie'. BBC (1992‚Äì1996) Tyldesley received an offer to join the BBC's sports department in London in the summer of 1992. BBC's partnership with BSkyB enabled them to obtain highlights rights for the new Premier League in the spring of 1992, and they added Tyldesley to their established commentary team of John Motson, Barry Davies and Tony Gubba. For four years he contributed commentaries, voice-overs and film reports to Match of the Day and Sportsnight, working at the 1994 World Cup and the 1996 European Championships as a BBC commentator. Because of the pre-eminence of Motson and Davies, he only commentated on 4 live matches in as many years with the BBC and in 1996 he was offered a chance to return to ITV. Tyldesley's final weeks with the BBC were spent commentating on the basketball tournaments at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Return to ITV (1996‚Äì) Tyldesley rejoined ITV in August 1996 as an understudy to Moore, who he often cites with Motson and Reg Gutteridge as the greatest influences on his commentary career. When Moore retired in 1998, Tyldesley became the network's lead football commentator. During his first season in that role, he commentated alongside Ron Atkinson on all of Manchester United's games in their successful Champions League campaign in addition to their FA Cup final victory in that treble season of 1999. His most famous commentary lines came during the dramatic climax of the Champions League final of that year when he asked, \\"Can Manchester United score? They always score\\" moments before their equalizing goal. \\"Name on the trophy\\", \\"Solskjaer has won it\\" and \\"Manchester United have reached the Promised Land\\" are other phrases from his commentary fondly remembered by United fans. He has commentated on every Champions League final since 1998 for ITV, including dramatic successes for Liverpool and Chelsea as well as Manchester United. Tyldesley has been ITV's lead commentator at each European Championships since 2000 and World Cup since 2002. His regular co-commentators since Atkinson's resignation in 2004 have been David Pleat, Jim Beglin, Andy Townsend, and Glenn Hoddle. On 27 June 2016, Tyldesley was the ITV commentator for the English national team's shocking 2-1 loss to Iceland in the Round of 16 at the UEFA Euro 2016. \\"It's another wretched night for England at a major tournament. It's difficult to think of anything quite as humbling as this defeat, certainly in living memory,\\" said Tyldesley after the final whistle. \\"This is the most abject failure that I can recall.\\" He admits that football commentary is the only job he has ever really wanted to do since he was a child and regularly volunteers to speak to sports broadcast students at universities and colleges. Tyldesley says his only career disappointments were three unsuccessful interviews for BBC Radio Sport during the 1980s. He has the three rejection letters framed. He says his own personal favourite sports commentators are Pat Summerall and Brian Johnston. Since 2019, he has called select games on NBC and NBCSN along with color commentator Lee Dixon. In July 2020, Tyldesley said he was \\"upset, baffled\\" and \\"annoyed\\" as ITV promoted Sam Matterface to be senior commentator in his place. This sparked public controversy, with some news outlets reporting that Tyldesley had been sacked, however this was false information. Later that year, he joined CBS Sports to be their lead commentator for the UEFA Champions League. Video games He has provided and written scripts for the sound commentary on EA Sports FIFA series along with Andy Gray starting with FIFA 06. From 2011-2017 along with Andy Townsend mostly (PS2 and PSP (Only FIFA 12 to FIFA 14), PC, PS3 & PS4 - International Friendly (FIFA 12 - FIFA 17), Wii, 3DS, iOS and Android (FIFA 12 - FIFA 15)) who was also appeared before in the DS version of FIFA 11, FIFA World Cup 2006, UEFA Champions League 2006‚Äì2007, UEFA Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, UEFA Euro 2012 and 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil and options in commentary for FIFA 12 to FIFA 13. He also provided commentary for Championship Manager 2, the last in the franchise to feature verbal analysis, and the PlayStation video games This is Football and FA Premier League Stars 2001. Tyldesley has been host of the International Electronic Games Conference as part of the Edinburgh Festival on two occasions. He also delivered the Roscoe Lecture at St George's Hall, Liverpool in 2008.

It extends for in a generally southeast‚Äìnorthwest direction from an intersection with NY 15 and NY 21 in the village of Wayland in Steuben County to a junction with NY 18 in the town of Yates in Orleans County, south of the Lake Ontario shoreline. The route passes through the city of Batavia and enters or comes near several villages, including Dansville and Medina. NY 63 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but to a largely different routing than it follows today. The original alignment of NY 63 was identical to its current alignment between Mount Morris and Pavilion; however, the route deviated significantly from its modern routing past those points as it extended southwest from Mount Morris to Hinsdale and north from Pavilion to Hamlin. It was rerouted north of Pavilion and south of Mount Morris in the early 1940s. The latter realignment supplanted New York State Route 36A, a Dansville‚ÄìMount Morris highway assigned in 1930. For a brief period during the 1970s, NY 63 began in Dansville instead of Wayland. Route description =Wayland to Geneseo= NY 63 begins at a four-way intersection with NY 15 and NY 21 in the village of Wayland, located in northern Steuben County. It heads west through the village on the two-lane West Naples Street to a less developed part of the town of Wayland, where it parallels Interstate 390 (I-390) on the north side of a wide valley. The route soon enters Livingston County and the town of North Dansville, gaining the name Main Street as it bends northwestward into the village of Dansville. Here, it overlaps with NY 36 for one block through the village center, beginning at Clara Barton Street and ending at Ossian Street. After another block, NY 63 meets the south end of NY 256 at Perine Street. While NY 256 heads north toward Conesus Lake, NY 63 proceeds northwest past Dansville Municipal Airport and out of the village limits. alt=A paved two-lane road curving to the left into the distance through a large grassy area below a blue sky filled with cumulus clouds Continuing north into the town of Sparta, NY 63 runs along the east side of a wide, rural valley surrounding Canaseraga Creek, with NY 36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY 258, a connector to NY 36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY 408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY 63 is the primary route to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit at the point where the expressway crosses under NY 63\\\\. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY 63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route 20A (US 20A) and NY 39 just outside the village limits. =Geneseo to Batavia= The highway enters Geneseo from the south, taking the name Genesee Street as it passes the western edge of the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY 63 begins to curve northwest up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east‚Äìwest once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY 63 reconnects with NY 36\\\\. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY 36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY 63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use. alt=Two green signs on metal poles with white lettering and arrows pointing to the left. The larger one says \\"Buffalo area\\" and the smaller says \\"Trucks to Warsaw\\". There is a road behind it to the left leading to an intersection at the rear. From Greigsville, the route heads west through open land into the northeast corner of Wyoming County and the town of Covington. At Peoria, the highway turns to head due northwest, its direction for the next . The bend at Peoria was once a sharp, accident- prone turn known as Peoria Curve; however, the route has been slightly realigned to the north to create a longer, more gradual curve. From Peoria, NY 63 runs across rolling, open terrain to the Genesee County line and the town of Pavilion. Just past the county line, the route connects to the northern end of NY 246\\\\. A mile (1.6 km) beyond, NY 63 drops down slightly to intersect with NY 19 at the hamlet of Pavilion. After the traffic light at the center of the hamlet, NY 63 crosses Oatka Creek and climbs back up out of the Wyoming Valley. Once atop the hill, it continues due northwest to its next junction, the underdeveloped crossing of US 20\\\\. Here at least some Buffalo-bound traffic will turn west. Eventually acquiring the name Ellicott Street, NY 63 crosses sparsely populated parts of the towns of Bethany and Batavia on its way to the city of Batavia. The route passes under the Depew, Lancaster and Western Railroad and the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line on its way into downtown, where it intersects the two major east-west trunk routes in this corridor, NY 5 and NY 33\\\\. It overlaps with both roads for several blocks along Main Street, with NY 33 splitting off at Oak Street. This junction is also where NY 63 meets the north‚Äìsouth NY 98, which connects to the Thruway just north of the city. =Batavia to Yates= NY 63 and NY 31 north through Medina village NY 63 forks from NY 5 at the western city line, returning to the town of Batavia, changing names to Lewiston Road as it passes by Batavia Downs and runs northwest from downtown. The highway crosses over the Thruway with no access to the highway on its way across another rural stretch leading to the village of Oakfield, located in the town of the same name, where NY 262 departs to the east. Just north of Oakfield, NY 63 turns due west on Judge Road, with Lewiston Road continuing northwest as County Route 12 (CR 12). NY 63 follows Judge Road into the town of Alabama, passing through the hamlet of South Alabama on its way to an undeveloped junction with NY 77 north of Basom. NY 63 turns north here, overlapping with NY 77 for to the hamlet of Alabama. In the center of the community, NY 63 reconnects to CR 12, and NY 77 turns west to follow the county road to the Niagara County line. Past Alabama, NY 63 continues northward across the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge and into Orleans County. It traverses open, undeveloped areas of the town of Shelby to reach the village of Medina. This village begins at a junction with NY 31 and NY 31A. The latter highway continues eastward while the former joins NY 63 through the village's historic central district on Main Street. At Center Street, NY 31E comes in from the west and NY 31 leaves NY 63 to continue east. NY 63 continues northwest on Main and Commercial streets to the edge of the village, where it turns northward onto Prospect Avenue and subsequently crosses over the Erie Canal. The northernmost two blocks of the overlap with NY 31 are maintained by the village of Medina, as are the two blocks of Main Street leading away from the north end of the concurrency. This is the only segment of NY 63 not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). NY 63 northbound in Medina For the next , the highway serves a stretch of scattered homes along the western bank of Oak Orchard Creek. It traverses a mix of fields and forests to reach the town and hamlet of Ridgeway, the latter located at NY 63's junction with NY 104\\\\. NY 63 briefly overlaps the east‚Äìwest trunk road before resuming a northerly, downhill alignment toward the town of Yates. The route passes through the village of Lyndonville as Main Street, crossing over Johnson Creek in the center of the community before intersecting NY 18 about north of the village limits in the hamlet of Yates Center. NY 63 ends here while the highway continues north toward Lake Ontario as Lyndonville Road. History =Origins and designation= The New York State Legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes in 1908, with two of the routes using parts of what is now NY 63\\\\. The stretch of NY 63 connecting Dansville to Hampton Corners in the town of Mount Morris became part of Route 15, a highway continuing south to Hornell and north through Mount Morris to Caledonia. Farther north, the piece between Medina and Ridgeway was designated as part of Route 30, a cross-state route running from Niagara Falls to Rouses Point. Route 30 originally followed current NY 31 to Rochester; however, it was realigned on March 1, 1921, to use Ridge Road instead, bypassing the Medina‚ÄìRidgeway highway. NY 63 northbound at Johnson Creek in Lyndonville In the mid-1920s, three sections of modern NY 63 received posted route numbers for the first time. From Wayland to Dansville, the road was the westernmost part of NY 52\\\\. What is now NY 63 was unnumbered from Dansville northwest to Hampton Corners, where NY 36 entered from the west on current NY 408 and followed the path of NY 63 to Geneseo. The road was unnumbered again until Pavilion, at which point NY 62 joined from the south and utilized all of current NY 63 and CR 63-1 to reach the Lake Ontario shoreline in Yates. By 1926, all numbered portions of current NY 63 were state-maintained, as were the unnumbered parts from Geneseo to Piffard and from Groveland to Hampton Corners. NY 63 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The initial routing of NY 63 was significantly different from its modern alignment; in fact, the only portion of modern NY 63 that still follows its original alignment is the section between Hampton Corners and Pavilion. South of Mount Morris, the route followed what is now NY 408 to Dalton and continued south on Old State Road and west on Allegany County's CR 16 to NY 19 west of the village of Angelica. NY 63 overlapped NY 19 south to Belvidere, where NY 63 turned onto modern CR 20\\\\. It continued west on CR 20 and NY 446 through Cuba to a junction with NY 16 in Hinsdale, where it ended. North of Pavilion, NY 63 followed modern NY 19 to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Hamlin. =Alignment changes= The portion of what is now NY 63 north of Pavilion was designated as part of NY 19 in the 1930 renumbering. However, unlike current NY 63, NY 19 continued north for another on Lyndonville Road past NY 18 to the Lake Ontario shoreline. South of Mount Morris, modern NY 63 was designated as NY 36A from Mount Morris to Dansville. From Dansville to Wayland, the highway was part of NY 39 (later NY 245), a new route that replaced NY 52 in the 1930 renumbering. The first change to NY 63 came when the alignments of NY 19 and NY 63 were swapped, placing both routes on their modern alignments. NY 63 was altered again in December 1940 to follow the former routing of NY 36A south from Mount Morris to Dansville, from where it continued east to Wayland by way of an overlap with NY 245. NY 63 north near NY 262 in Oakfield NY 245 was truncated northeastward to Naples and NY 63 was cut back to NY 36 in Dansville around the same time, leaving the Dansville‚ÄìWayland highway as an unsigned reference route. This was partially reversed in the late 1970s or early 1980s when NY 63 was reextended to Wayland. On April 1, 1989, ownership and maintenance of Lyndonville Road north of NY 18 was transferred from the state of New York to Orleans County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. NY 63 was truncated to end at its junction with NY 18 while its former routing to the lake became CR 63-1. In the mid-2000s, the route was reconfigured in the northern part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. The change was made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY 31E on Center Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY 63's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July 1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state. =Proposed Mount Morris‚ÄìPavilion bypass= As part of a large scale study in the early 2000s, NYSDOT determined that NY 63 from Mount Morris to Pavilion, along with US 20 and NY 77‚Äîtermed the \\"Route 63 Corridor\\"‚Äîwere major trouble routes, primarily because of increased truck traffic using the corridor as a bypass between I-390 in Mount Morris and the New York State Thruway in Pembroke. The most publicized and perhaps most fought-over possibility mentioned was that of a new expressway from Mount Morris to Pembroke, bypassing these three routes. The Wyoming County Chamber of Commerce was a driving force behind this, hoping interchanges in Perry, Warsaw and Attica would promote business growth. While residents along the NY 63 corridor are against the increased truck traffic along the corridor (spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway. The general consensus of all of these groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY 63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania. NY 63A NY 63A was an alternate route of NY 63 between Angelica, Allegany County, and Nunda, Livingston County. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering and redesignated as NY 408A in the early 1940s.

Andrew Sibbald School was reserved for grades 1‚Äì9. Because the school was unable to house the influx of students, grade 12 students were forced to attend Mount Royal College to complete their senior matriculation. As the population of Cochrane increased, the need to build a suitable high school was approved by the Board of Cochrane School district. In December 1962, students were moved to a new building. On January 1, 1966, the schools in Cochrane became a part of Calgary Rural School Division #41 (later to become Rocky View School Division #41). New additions to the building included a home Economics room, Industrial Arts room, Biology lab, library and typing room to conclude projects for the school in the 1960s. In subsequent years, full renovations occurred such a new gymnasium, a separate wing for the Junior High, library expansion, new science labs, a drama room, cafeteria/student lounge area and a transformation of administrative areas (including guidance offices).

He notably predicted in his 1965 book L'Agonie du R√©gime en Russie Sovi√©tique (The Death Struggle of the Regime in Soviet Russia) that the USSR would collapse by 1970. Early years Garder was born in Imperial Russia. His family belonged to the local aristocracy and his grandfather was a Marshal of the Imperial Russian Army. He left Russia aged four during the Russian Civil War and settled to France with his family. Military career Garder joined the French Army. During the Second World War, he fought in 1940 during the German invasion of France. He joined the resistance against Nazi occupation. He was arrested in 1943 and subsequently detained in several concentration camps. After the war, he worked in military intelligence and eventually retired with the rank of colonel. Writings After retiring from the military, Garder published various writings about the Soviet Union and communist regimes. He published a biography of Mao Zedong, a book about the German-Soviet War, another about the East German Army and, 1965, L'Agonie du R√©gime en Russie Sovi√©tique (The Death Struggle of the Regime in Soviet Russia) In the latter book, Garder stated that the death agony of the Soviet union was evident in \\"the conflict between a decaying regime that no longer has any justification other than the personal interests of those who profit by it\\" and \\"the upper strata of the technological intelligentsia.\\" (Full book online ) Garder argued that this contest cannot end in a compromise. There is not enough flexibility in the dictatorship. He then predicted a collapse: probably a non-communist and perhaps anti-communist take-over with the help of the military elites. \\"Recognition of the harebrained absurdity of a Marxist-Leninist religion has long ago become inevitable for the true elite of the country and is from day to day dawning upon millions of \\"average persons.\\" There will come a moment when the technological masses \\"will feel impelled to seize power.\\" Garder's book and prediction were strongly criticized at the time. In a symposium launched to review the book, Yale Professor Frederick C. Barghoorn dismissed Garder's book as \\"the latest in a long line of apocalyptic predictions of the collapse of communism.\\" He warns that \\"great revolutions are most infrequent and that successful political systems are tenacious and adaptive.\\" In addition, the reviewer of the book, Michael Tatu, disapproved of the \\"apocalyptic character\\" of such a forecast and is almost apologetic for treating it seriously. When the Soviet Union did collapse, twenty years about the date he had foreseen, Garder joked that \\"the corpse moved longer than expected\\".

Publication history Created by writer Paul Jenkins and artists Ron Garney and Mike McKone, John Ryker first appeared in The Incredible Hulk Vol. 3 #12 (March 2000). Fictional character biography A corrupt U.S. Army General, John Ryker joined the military at a young age and wanted to help determine future history from the shadows. One of his most prominent actions was manipulating the creation of the conspiracy around John F. Kennedy's assassination where apparently two Corsican mercenaries were the killers but at the time was deemed too expensive to wage World War Three so the idea of a conspiracy was created. When his wife Lucy Ryker developed cancer, Ryker used the military to hunt down Bruce Banner who turned into the Hulk after gamma radiation exposure during a nuclear test that Ryker supervised.Incredible Hulk Vol. 3 #12 Ryker initially irradiated various subjects to try and duplicate the same accident behind the Hulk, with the goal of allowing him to isolate the Hulk's ability to cope with the radiation and use to heal his wife; his closest success was Private Benjamin Tibbits mutating into the imperfect Flux, leading to Ryker simply breaking Flux as a near-mindless soldier against the Hulk.Incredible Hulk Vol. 3 #17-19 However, his brutal treatment to the Hulk not only broke down the Hulk's other personalities' mental barriers from taking control, including the Devil Hulk, but also convinced General Thunderbolt Ross to turn against Ryker and free their long-time enemy. Taking Lucy hostage, Ross told the truth to Lucy, prompting Ryker to depart as Lucy coldly told him that Lucy didn't ask to be healed at the cost of innocent people.Incredible Hulk vol. 3 #20 Ryker is responsible for the special Gamma Corps military unit that dealt with the Hulk. He was spurred into action after his wife (who seemed to have been cured by a transfusion of the Hulk's blood) died from a sudden revival of cancer. His unit were unable to stop the Hulk (who went after Ryker) and caused Gamma Corps member Grey (who had the Hulk's DNA within) to lose temper, resulting in a Hulk-like rage that tore down Ryker's base with the General still inside.World War Hulk: Gamma Corps #4 However, Ryker later reappears as the CEO of Origins Corporation which specializes in giving average people superpowers through gene therapy, and sending the new Gamma Corps: Black unit under Norman Osborn's auspices to harvest the new She-Hulk's DNA.The Incredible Hulk #601 Powers and abilities General John Ryker has no superpowers but he's a genius strategist, an adept deceiver and a master manipulator.

This version is very similar to his comic counterpart. He sends out the military for the Hulk's capture so that he might be able to study the Hulk. When discovering the Gamma Orb, Ryker plans to get the Gamma Orb for his own purposes but Ravage gets the device. Ryker decided to kill both the Hulk and Ravage. He also had the Hulkbusters and Private Benjamin \\"Benny\\" Tibbetts to fight the Hulk. At the end of game, he is seen in base where Flux went to recover and he presumably began experimenting on his henchman. * John Ryker is alluded in Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes.

Each Kuhn segment can be thought of as if they are freely jointed with each other.Flory, P.J. (1953) Principles of Polymer Chemistry, Cornell Univ. Press, Flory, P.J. (1969) Statistical Mechanics of Chain Molecules, Wiley, ; reissued 1989, Rubinstein, M., Colby, R. H. (2003)Polymer Physics, Oxford University Press, Each segment in a freely jointed chain can randomly orient in any direction without the influence of any forces, independent of the directions taken by other segments. Instead of considering a real chain consisting of n bonds and with fixed bond angles, torsion angles, and bond lengths, Kuhn considered an equivalent ideal chain with N connected segments, now called Kuhn segments, that can orient in any random direction. The length of a fully stretched chain is L=Nb for the Kuhn segment chain. In the simplest treatment, such a chain follows the random walk model, where each step taken in a random direction is independent of the directions taken in the previous steps, forming a random coil. The average end-to-end distance for a chain satisfying the random walk model is \\\\langle R^2\\\\rangle = Nb^2. Since the space occupied by a segment in the polymer chain cannot be taken by another segment, a self-avoiding random walk model can also be used. The Kuhn segment construction is useful in that it allows complicated polymers to be treated with simplified models as either a random walk or a self-avoiding walk, which can simplify the treatment considerably. For an actual homopolymer chain (consists of the same repeat units) with bond length l and bond angle Œ∏ with a dihedral angle energy potential, the average end-to- end distance can be obtained as :\\\\langle R^2 \\\\rangle = n l^2 \\\\frac{1+\\\\cos(\\\\theta)}{1-\\\\cos(\\\\theta)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\langle\\\\cos(\\\\textstyle\\\\phi\\\\,\\\\\\\\!)\\\\rangle}{1-\\\\langle\\\\cos (\\\\textstyle\\\\phi\\\\,\\\\\\\\!)\\\\rangle} , ::where \\\\langle \\\\cos(\\\\textstyle\\\\phi\\\\,\\\\\\\\!) \\\\rangle is the average cosine of the dihedral angle. The fully stretched length L = nl\\\\, \\\\cos(\\\\theta/2). By equating the two expressions for \\\\langle R^2 \\\\rangle and the two expressions for L from the actual chain and the equivalent chain with Kuhn segments, the number of Kuhn segments N and the Kuhn segment length b can be obtained. For worm-like chain, Kuhn length equals two times the persistence length.Gert R.

MTS allows for both a bulk tuning dump message, giving a tuning for each of 128 notes, and a tuning message for individual notes as they are played. Frequency values If ∆í is a frequency, then the corresponding frequency data value d may be computed by :d = 69 + 12 \\\\log_2 \\\\left(\\\\frac {f}{440\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz}}\\\\right).\\\\, The quantity log2 (∆í / 440 Hz) is the number of octaves above the 440-Hz concert A (it is negative if the frequency is below that pitch). Multiplying it by 12 gives the number of semitones above that frequency. Adding 69 gives the number of semitones above the C five octaves below middle C. Since 440 Hz is a widely used standard concert A (e.g. USA, UK), and since that is represented in MIDI terms by the integer 69 (nine semitones above middle C, which is 60), this gives a real number which expresses pitch in a manner consistent with MIDI and integer notation, known as the midi note number. Converting from midi note number (d) to frequency (f) is given by the following formula: :f = 2^{(d-69)/12} \\\\cdot 440\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hz} \\\\, Frequency Data Format The frequency data format allows for the precise notation of frequencies that differ from equal temperament. \\"Frequency data shall be defined in [units] which are fractions of a semitone. The frequency range starts at MIDI note 0, C = 8.1758 Hz, and extends above MIDI note 127, G = 12543.854 Hz. The first byte of the frequency data word specifies the highest equal-tempered semitone not exceeding the frequency. The next two bytes (14 bits) specify the fraction of 100 cents above the semitone at which the frequency lies. Effective resolution = 100 cents / 214 = .0061 cents.\\" This higher resolution allows a logarithmic representation of pitch in which the semitone is divided into 1282 = 214 = 16384 parts, which means the octave is divided into 196608 (logarithmically) equal parts. These parts are exactly 100/16384 cents (approximately 0.0061 cents) in size, which is far below the threshold of human pitch perception and which therefore allows a very accurate representation of pitch. Applications The precision pitch values may be used in microtonal music, just intonation, meantone temperament, or other alternative tunings. Software which supports MTS includes Scala and TiMidity++. Software plugin instruments which support MTS include Native Instruments FM8, Synthogy Ivory, and Xen-Arts' various xenharmonic VSTi plugins, including the FMTS FM synthesizer, Ivor virtual analog synthesizer, and XenFont SoundFont sample player. Hardware instruments in current production which support MTS include: Dave Smith Instruments (DSI) Rev-2, Prophet-12, Prophet-6, Oberheim OB-6, Moog Sub37, Minitaur, Novation Bass Station II, Peak, Sonoclast Plastic Pitch Plus, and the Waldorf Kyra.

He was a large pinstriped bird that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee catcher Thurman Munson. His name was a play on the classic American folk song \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\". Creation Eager to add a mascot, Yankees management contracted Wayde Harrison and Bonnie Erickson of Acme Mascots, who created the Phillie Phanatic in 1978, to develop a mascot for their franchise. After a meeting with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, in which Steinbrenner and Erickson argued over the shade of blue to use, the Yankees leased Dandy for three years and $30,000. Release and reception On July 10, 1979, The San Diego Chicken, then working for the Seattle Mariners, put a hex on Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry during a game at the Seattle Kingdome. Yankees outfielder Lou Piniella responded by chasing the mascot and throwing his glove at him. In response, Steinbrenner said that mascots had no place in baseball, despite the imminent release of Dandy. Dandy debuted in late-July 1979, weeks after the incident in Seattle. When Thurman Munson died in a plane crash on August 2, 1979, Dandy was put on hiatus, as Dandy resembled Munson. Though Yankees organist Eddie Layton composed a song for Dandy, it was never played. Dandy was confined to the upper deck area of Yankee Stadium by Yankees management. After the lease expired, Harrison and Erickson declined the Yankees' request to sign another lease, as they felt the mascot did not receive the necessary support from management. Aftermath Along with this experiment, the Yankees briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during the mid-1990s. Outside these two occasions, the Yankees have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform on the field. Unofficial mascots have included a squirrel that Teddy Kider of The New York Times nicknamed \\"Left Field Ratatosk\\" after it was seen on the right field foul pole in late 2007.For Yankees, Squirrel‚Äôs Visit May Be Omen (a Bad One) The squirrel was referred to as \\"Scooter\\" by the fans, for Yankees legendary shortstop, Phil Rizzuto, who died in August 2007. Though George Steinbrenner gave final approval to Dandy, he claimed had \\"no recollection\\" of Dandy in 1998. Joseph M. Perello, vice president for business development for the Yankees, and Lonn Trost, Yankees' general counsel, were unaware that the Yankees once had a mascot.

Early life and career Ted Sannella was born in Revere, Massachusetts. He graduated from Revere High School in 1945, and in 1949 graduated from Tufts College in Medford, receiving degrees in biology and chemistry. He worked as pharmacist at Richardson Drug in Concord, Massachusetts, for many years. He retired after 35 years as a pharmacist and moved to Wiscasset, Maine, in 1989. He died November 18, 1995, at the age of 67. Dance career Sannella devoted much of his adult life to traditional New England dance as a caller, choreographer, dancer, and leader. He began calling professionally in 1946 and organized dance series in Cambridge, Westport Point, and Concord, Massachusetts, and in his final years, North Whitefield, Maine. He was influential as a revered and well-liked caller, as a choreographer through his social dance compositions and books, and via his cheerful attention to teaching about the pleasures of joy and style in social dance. His vigor, energy and perspective influenced many callers and dancers, and his dance compositions are regularly seen today at contra dances, 20 and 30 years after their original composition. Sannella was long involved with the New England Folk Festival Association (NEFFA) as a leader and board member. He served as president of NEFFA and the North of Boston Callers Association and was also on the board of the nationally-oriented Country Dance and Song Society. His contributions to social dance were recognized via honorary or life memberships in the Folk Arts Center of New England and the Country Dance Society, Boston Centre.Obituary His multi-faceted and generous involvement with dance and dance leadership, experience and longevity, earned him the moniker The Dean of New England Callers. One of Sannella's memorable choreographic innovations, inspired by the three-couple English country dance set dance, was to compose \\"triplets\\" suitable to contra dance tempo reels and jigs. His 41 published triplets were commonly known as Ted's Triplets. Triplets are still composed, and sometimes seen on the dance floor. Sannella was very interested in the history of dance, and he possessed an extensive collection of 500-plus dance books and more than 3,000 recordings. He was a careful note-taker, and his dance cards indicate his opinion of the best tunes to go with each dance. His archive consisting of published materials, 50 boxes of personal papers and his dance cards, invaluable to any American folk-dance researcher or present-day caller, is now in the possession of the University of New Hampshire special collection entitled the New Hampshire Library of Traditional Music & Dance.UNH New Hampshire Library of Traditional Music and Dance Publications  * References External links * University of New Hampshire, New Hampshire Library of Traditional Music & Dance: Ted Sannella * David Smukler's Index of Ted Sannella's published dances * The annotated bibliography for Ted Sannella's Swing the Next Category:American choreographers Category:Folk dancers Category:People from Revere, Massachusetts Category:1928 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People from Wiscasset, Maine ","title":"Ted Sannella"},{"id":"4834176","text":"\\"Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow\\" is a novelty nonsensical doo-wop song by the Rivingtons in 1962.

Its flagship series was Rock 'N' Roll Comics. Founded by Todd Loren, Revolutionary Comics was based in San Diego. History = Origins = After some success with Musicade, a mail order music memorabilia company, Loren formed Revolutionary Comics in 1989. The publisher's first title was Rock 'N' Roll Comics, a line of unauthorized comic book biographies of rock stars prompted in part by the success of a 1986 Bruce Springsteen parody comic called Hey Boss. = Rock 'N' Roll Comics = Early issues of Rock 'N' Roll Comics contained straight biographies in comic form and Mad magazine-style parodies. The parodies were later dropped. The line featured unlicensed biographies of rock stars, told in comic book form but geared for adults, often with very adult situations (nudity, drug use, violence, etc.).Peisneraug, David. \\"Part Ramones Biography, Part Dreamscape,\\" New York Times (Aug. 8, 2013). The comic sported a cover tagline reading \\"Unauthorized and Proud of it.\\" Some musicians featured in the comic were supportive, while others threatened legal action. The resulting media exposure garnered Rock 'N' Roll Comics huge sales of their early issues.\\"New Kids vs. Revolutionary\\": Rolling Stone (Apr. 1992). A later injunction\\"Rock 'N Roll Comics Distribution Interrupted,\\" Comics Buyer's Guide, #829 (Oct. 6, 1989), p. 1, 28. led the company to expand its distribution network outside traditional comic shops, getting their products into music and gift retail outlets which had never carried comics before. This independence from the comic book direct market served the company well, as sales continued to rise from issue to issue.Fogel's Underground Comix Price Guide, 2006. Revolutionary's only other title at first was the bimonthly Tipper Gore's Comics and Stories, an EC- inspired horror anthology which lasted five issues. Other one-shots and short- lived titles followed, but the heart of the company was Rock 'N' Roll Comics, which continued to sell large quantities. = Expansion = By the early nineties, Revolutionary Comics was among the top three selling independent comic companies in the U.S. Loren brought on his father, Herb Shapiro, to be vice president of the growing company, while Jay Allen Sanford, who'd worked for Loren's Musicade and was writing for Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics, became the line's head writer. New music titles were launched, most notably Rock 'N' Roll Comics Magazine and Hard Rock Comics, as well as a line of \\"Experience\\" limited series, on such subjects as the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd (the latter of which the band liked well enough to include in their official Shine On CD box set). In 1991, Revolutionary started a line of unauthorized sports biographical comics, which eventually included such titles as Baseball Superstars Comics, Baseball Legends Comics, Sports Superstars Comics, and Sports Legends Comics. = Carnal Comics = In 1991 Loren launched Carnal Comics, an adults-only imprint, to publish Lyndal Ferguson's erotic anthology series Sexpot, SS Crompton's Demi the Demoness, and Allen Salyer's Pineapple Perfume. Printer troubles led to some delays, but the first three Carnal Comics titles were released all at once in 1992. All only lasted a single issue. = Loren murder and company reorganization = After Loren's June 1992 murder,\\"NewsWatch: Todd Loren Slain,\\" The Comics Journal #151 (July 1992), p. 11. the company continued for two more years, under Loren's father and with Sanford serving as managing editor. During those years, Kiss participated in a three-issue biographical series called Kiss Pre-History, and other new music titles were launched, such as British Invasion and Alternative Comics. The erotic imprint's next title, the limited series Carnal Comics: Sarah Jane Hamilton was also successful, selling in numbers almost as high as Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics (which, while in decline, along with all U.S. comics publishers at the time, were still selling 15,000 to 20,000 copies per issue). The Hamilton limited series was the last title published by Revolutionary. = Dissolution and legacy = Herb Shapiro decided to close the company in summer 1994, in part because of debt accrued by a failed color sports comic line.Groth, Gary. \\"Revolutionary In Financial Disarray,\\" Comics Journal #164 (Dec. 1993). In the end, Revolutionary published more than 300 individual issues. Under the banner Re-Visionary Press, Sanford continued to publish the Carnal Comics imprint; he later oversaw reprints of Revolutionary titles in digital editions and graphic novels licensed in the U.S. and overseas, including a 2014 Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics series licensed to Croatian publishers. Sanford and Herb Shapiro kept the Revolutionary archive intact, including over 9,000 pages of original interior artwork, around 250 original cover paintings and illustrations, and all of the scripts, production materials, and printer film used to produce the comics. The copyrights and trademarks to all of the titles Revolutionary produced are also maintained, allowing for digital distribution via iTunes, Amazon.com, and other online outlets, where the comics continue to be popular with fans of both the subjects and offbeat comic books. = Bluewater Productions collections = In September 2009, publisher Bluewater Productions announced it would be reprinting Revolutionary's line of music comics (including stories from Rock 'N' Roll Comics) in ten monthly volumes, averaging 250 pages each.Parkin, J.K. \\"Don‚Äôt call it a comeback: Bluewater to collect classic Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics,\\" Comic Book Resources: Robot6 (September 10, 2009). The first collections were The Beatles Experience and Hard Rock Heroes, released in early 2010. Many of Revolutionary's original creators participated in updating and modernizing the contents of the musical comic bios. The reprints and updates were supervised by long-time Rock 'N' Roll Comics writer/editor Jay Allen Sanford. Ultimately, Bluewater released seven titles from 2010‚Äì2012:Sanford, Jay Allen, \\"No more Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics reprint editions from Bluewater Productions,\\" San Diego Reader blog (March 23, 2013). * The Beatles Experience (Feb. 2010), 240 pp. * Hard Rock Heroes (Apr. 2010), 240 pp. ‚Äî with AC/DC, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Ozzy Osbourne/Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Megadeth, Spirit, Queensr√øche, Mot√∂rhead, ZZ Top * The Runaways: Joan Jett ‚Äì Lita Ford (Aug. 2010), 32 pp. * The Pink Floyd Experience (Sept. 2010), 150 pp. * The Led Zeppelin Experience (Nov. 2010), 150 pp. * The Elvis Presley Experience (Mar. 2011), 210 pp. * Stan Lee: the Biography!

Legal challenges  The unauthorized nature of Revolutionary's biographical titles, despite the company's commitment to journalistic reporting, led to legal issues from the beginning. Loren billed his company as an advocate for free speech, and made his case in court in a number of decisions.Groth, Gary. \\"Todd Loren - First Amendment Advocate Or Lying Sack Of Shit?\\" Comics Journal #138 (Oct. 1990). Rock 'N' Roll Comics #1, cover-dated June 1989, resulted in a cease and desist order from the subject band, Guns N' Roses. No lawsuit was filed in that case, and resulting media coverage led to the comic going into multiple printings. Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics #3 and #4, on Bon Jovi and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, respectively (cover-dated Sept. 1989 and Oct. 1989), did result in legal challenges over merchandising rights, which the company circumvented by distributing the comics through alternative routes. Rock 'N' Roll Comics #8, featuring Skid Row, was never published, due to a similar injunction related to merchandising rights.Herrmann, Brenda. \\"Rockin' Comics: Super Heroes Of Music Play An Exciting New Venue ‚Äî the World Of Cartoons,\\" Chicago Tribune (October 20, 1991). Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics #12 (June 1990), an unauthorized biography of New Kids on the Block, led to a lawsuit.\\"New Kids On The Block Sue Revolutionary,\\" The Comics Journal #136 (July 1990), p. 17. Loren claimed the First Amendment protected the journalistic rights of his \\"illustrated articles\\" and he took the matter to the U.S. District Court in California. In April 1990, U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades declared that Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics #12 could be distributed because it is ‚Äúpart biography and part satire.‚Äù The judge's 12-page ruling stated that ‚Äúbookstores are filled with biographies ‚Äî both authorized and unauthorized ‚Äî of public figures. And, while the subjects of such biographies may be offended by the publication of their life stories, they generally have no claim for trademark infringement.‚Äù Rhoades‚Äô ruling also stated, ‚ÄúIt appears that the First Amendment may trump any claim that the plaintiffs have for trademark infringement.‚Äù The resultant order stated that Winterland Concessions Co. failed to show that the case met the standards required to issue a preliminary injunction. This dissolved the temporary restraining order prohibiting distribution. New Kids responded by filing suit for trademark infringement since its logo appeared in the comic. A settlement between New Kids and Revolutionary was reached in August 1990. It permanently enjoined Revolutionary from ‚Äúadvertising, manufacturing, distributing and/or selling or otherwise commercially exploiting any publication displaying the trademark and/or logo of the New Kids on the Block, either as a group or individually.‚Äù Loren promptly reprinted the New Kids story in magazine format (Rock 'N' Roll Comics Magazine), without depicting the band's logo. The lawsuits garnered Revolutionary worldwide press, eventually resulting in high sales for an independent comics publisher.\\"New Kids on the Block vs. Revolutionary Comics,\\" San Diego Reader blog (Sept. 13, 2007). Rock 'N' Roll Comics #61, about the band Yes, and scheduled for July 1993 release, was blocked from publication. Revolutionary's sports titles also faced legal challenges. In 1993, the company lost a lawsuit filed by the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins over the use of the team's logo in one of Revolutionary's sports comics.\\"Newswatch: Revolutionary Told to Ice Penguin Usage,\\" The Comics Journal #159 (May 1993), p. 19. In 1994, the company settled a suit brought by football player Joe Montana based on one of its comics.\\"Joe Montana Suit Settled,\\" The Comics Journal #168 (May 1994), pp. 38-39.  Documentary film  In 2005, BulletProof Film released a documentary titled Unauthorized and Proud Of It: Todd Loren‚Äôs Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics. The documentary features interviews with Loren's family, surviving \\"Revolutionaries,\\" comic book colleagues, adversaries, supporters, and past and present rock 'n' roll stars featured in Revolutionary's comics. Appearing in the film are Alice Cooper, publishers Gary Groth (Fantagraphics) and Denis Kitchen (Kitchen Sink Press), famed groupie Cynthia Plaster Caster, underground painter and cover artist Robert Williams (known for his controversial album art for the first Guns N' Roses LP), Jay Allen Sanford, Gene Simmons (audio only), and more. The documentary also details the San Diego police department's investigation into Loren's murder; interviews with Loren's coworkers and family members suggest that the police failed to follow up on all available leads.

The game was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Universal Interactive and was released on May 27, 2003 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows. A Game Boy Advance version was released as The Incredible Hulk. Eric Bana reprises his role from the film as Bruce Banner, and the game's story takes place eight years after the film. The Xbox version of Hulk is playable on Xbox 360. Plot Eight years after the film, the game begins in a dream sequence where a man named Bruce Banner transforms into a large and powerful monster dubbed the Hulk and destroys waves of soldiers and tanks sent by the military to attack him. Upon awakening, Bruce Banner is contacted by his old mentor Dr. Crawford who explains that he has developed a cure for the Hulk called the Gamma Orb. Unfortunately, military troops led by the corrupt General John Ryker have raided the lab. Bruce Banner sneaks into the lab and discovers that General Ryker wants to obtain the Gamma Orb. After reaching Dr. Crawford, Bruce allows his old mentor to use the Gamma Orb on him, but Crawford betrays Banner and uses it to steal the Hulk's energy. Crawford touches the Orb and absorbs a part of Bruce Banner's power transforming himself into a Hulk-like creature called Ravage. Simultaneously, Banner transforms into the Hulk. After a chase of Ravage over rooftops and through sewers with Ryker's forces in hot pursuit, Hulk finds himself at a dead end where he is ambushed by the vampire Half- Life. Hulk defeats Half-Life who explains that Ravage has taken the orb to Alcatraz but will kill a hostage there if the Hulk is detected. Bruce infiltrates Alcatraz which has been secretly occupied by the Leader and his private army. Bruce deactivates the Gamma detection device using a security terminal which shows live footage of a Gamma chamber used to mutate the Leader's henchmen into Gamma-irradiated super soldiers. It also shows the Leader's psychotic brother Madman taking the hostage Betty Ross to the irradiation chamber after being ordered by a mysterious voice to \\"dispose\\" of her when she refuses to further aid them in their schemes. Seeing Betty in distress causes Bruce to transform into the Hulk decimating the research facilities and defeating Madman after disabling the irradiation chamber. Betty tells the Hulk that she has been exposed to the Gamma radiation and must be taken to the military Gamma base. The Hulk takes Betty to the base, but is incapacitated by a force field. Bruce is sedated and strapped to an operating table where General Ryker plans on dissecting him. Betty frees Bruce, who (disguised as a soldier) formulates an antidote, transforming into the Hulk and fighting the military while trying to find and destroy the shield generator. Hulk finds the generator, but is confronted by Flux, a Hulk-like soldier. The Hulk defeats Flux and throws him into the generator, destroying it. Hulk escapes and returns to Alcatraz. After fighting through the Leader's forces as Hulk and Bruce Banner, Hulk finally confronts Ravage, who was guarding Leader's teleport device. Ravage is defeated and returns to the form of Dr. Crawford. Crawford informs Bruce that the Gamma Orb is at Leader's control center (called New Freehold) and Bruce teleports to it. After being ambushed by Half-Life and Madman, Bruce once again transforms into the Hulk and confronts them. Madman escapes at the middle of the fight, leaving Half- Life to battle Hulk alone. After beating Half-Life, the Hulk finally confronts the Leader. The Leader uses the orb to cure the Hulk. Bruce was finally free of his mutation, but in order to save humanity from the Leader's Gamma army, he touches the Orb to become the Hulk once more. He unleashes the Hulk, who beats the Leader despite his powerful psychic attacks and destroys the Gamma Orb. As New Freehold begins to collapse, the Leader escapes by teleporting himself. The Hulk manages to reach the teleport chamber, but he encounters one final fight with Madman. After defeating Madman, the Hulk teleports himself and escapes. The ending shows Dr. Crawford trying (and failing) to create another Gamma Orb, General Ryker experimenting on Flux, and Bruce Banner walking alongside a highway attempting to hitch a ride home. Banner's shadow was that of the Hulk. Reception Hulk received mixed reviews, but the overall response from critics, players and fans was positive. The game received praise for its music, graphics, gameplay, most of the game controls and camera functions, the more balanced tone compared to that of the film it is based on, and voice work, including that of the Grey Hulk. Meanwhile, the limited powers of the Hulk and the linear gameplay received criticisms. The Bruce Banner levels received mixed responses, with some criticizing it for its difficulty and placement in a game based on the Hulk, while others praising it for its stealth-based gameplay and variation it provides within the game itself. Entertainment Weekly stated that the game was too linear but appreciated its \\"mindless mayhem\\". Playboy also thought the game was linear and short, but fun. The Cincinnati Enquirer liked the game's controls and camera functions. The Village Voice lambasted the Bruce Banner levels. In Japan, where the PlayStation 2 version was ported by CyberFront for release on January 8, 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, two sixes, and one seven for a total of 26 out of 40.

From 1918 to 1936 border of Czechoslovakia was protected by \\"finance guard\\" (finanƒçn√≠ str√°≈æ), an armed branch of the Ministry of Finance. Their main task was to carry on customs duty, border protection was secondary. For over decade army and police leadership had suggested to set up an organisation of higher military value. Amid international tensions the new service was established in 1936. The roles of the defense guard were: * border security * law enforcement * customs enforcement Members of the guard were local gendarmes (ƒçetn√≠ci), existing finance guards and members of state police. Later citizens loyal to Czechoslovakia were incorporated (for example, many members of the sports organisation Sokol or active anti-fascist Germans). Plans were created to support the guard with regular army units to handle local conflicts. Planned size of the service were 38 battalions, but only 31 had been mustered (one of these inland, in Prague). Their equipment were pistols, rifles, light machine guns and grenades. There was not enough of time to equip the units with heavy machine guns. In case of attack, the guard was to delay the enemy until the army could respond. Manpower of the guard in September 1938 was 29,611 men (4,917 local policemen, 1,674 members of state police, 6,438 finance guards, 14,755 army reservists, 1,827 army members). As the tensions between Czechoslovakia, local Germans and Nazi Germany grew, the guard was deployed on the border during May 1938 and stayed there until end of September, when Sudetenland was ceded to Germany. During September the guard fought low-level warfare against local German partisans (Sudetendeutsches Freikorps) and commandos from Germany. After the loss of borderland, SOS moved inland to new positions. The clashes had still occurred but on smaller level. As a result of First Vienna Award Czechoslovakia was forced to give up territory to Poland and Hungary (southern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia). While conflicts with Polish forces were minor, clash with Hungarian forces and partisans (Szabadczapatok) was more intense (starting in November 1938). From January to March 1939 (until Czechoslovakia was dissolved) heavy clashes occurred between Hungarian forces and guard and the army in Ruthenia. Czechoslovakian units were forced to withdraw in three directions - to Slovakia, Poland and Romania. During March the units also faced local insurgents (Siƒçovci) attempting to establish an independent Ruthenian state. Estimated warfare losses (both guard and the army) from May 1938 to April 1939 are 171 dead, 404 injured, over thousand of soldiers taken prisoner and abducted to Germany proper. Losses in Ruthenia are estimated to 40 dead, 120 injured, 17 missing. On December 21, 1939, the government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia disbanded remaining parts of the guard. In Slovak State the guard was disbanded a little later. After the war the organisation was not restored. After communist takeover of power in 1948 special branch of the army called Border Guard (Pohraniƒçn√≠ slu≈æba) was tasked with border protection.

A strait in Peter the Great Gulf and a bay in the Tatar Strait are named after him. Biography Starck was born in Helsingfors (Helsinki) in the Grand Duchy of Finland and was of Scottish descent, Finno-Swedish ethnicity and Lutheran faith. He graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1864. In his early career, he participated on numerous expeditions as commander of the frigate Vostok from 1874‚Äì1877 to chart the Arctic and Pacific coasts of Siberia. He subsequently captained a gunboat in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) and later the gunboats Sivuch and Pervenets. He was captain of the cruiser from 1891‚Äì1892. From 11 April 1898 to 7 October 1902 Starck served in the Russian Pacific Fleet. On 6 December 1902, he was promoted to vice admiral. By appointment from Viceroy of the Russian Far East Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, Starck was commander of the Russian naval base at Port Arthur from 1 May 1898 to 7 October 1902. In February 1902 he was appointed commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, pp. 358‚Äì359. At the start of the Russian-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a pre-emptive strike on the Russian fleet anchored at Port Arthur, initiating the Battle of Port Arthur. At the time of the attack, Starck was holding a birthday party for his wife on the deck of his flagship, the battleship , and the crowd attending the party mistakenly thought the exploding Japanese ordnance was fired in honour of the birthday party. The Japanese attack was less-than-entirely successful, and Starck (despite wanting to engage the Japanese and being overruled by the Viceroy) was loudly criticized in the Russian and the world press as having suffered a huge defeat, and was subsequently sacked by Tsar Nicholas II from his post on 24 February 1904. Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived on 8 March 1904 as his replacement. Starck was given the Order of St. Vladimir and recalled to a staff assignment with the Russian Black Sea Fleet in 1906, but continued to be regarded as a scapegoat for the Battle of Port Arthur. After the war, Starck was discharged from the military in 1908 and became involved in business activities. For a time he was Chairman of the Board of the Obukhov State Plant and the Izhorskiye Zavody. Starck subsequently went into exile at Helsinki, Finland, where he died in 1928.

He lived through and influenced three distinct periods of New Mexico's history: the Spanish period, the Mexican period, and the American occupation and subsequent territorial period. Mart√≠nez appears as a character in Willa Cather's novel, Death Comes for the Archbishop.  Spanish period  Mart√≠nez was born Antonio Jose Martinez in Abiquiu on January 17, 1793, when New Mexico was a very isolated and desolate territory of the Spanish Empire. In 1804, the Martinez family, including his father Severino and five siblings, moved to Taos, a prosperous outpost, where they came to be known as Mart√≠nez. His mother was Mar√≠a del Carmel Santist√©van of La Plaza de Santa Rosa de Abiqui√∫. During his upbringing, Mart√≠nez's father taught him the importance of ranching and farming at the Hacienda Mart√≠nez in Northern New Mexico. In 1811, Mart√≠nez married Mar√≠a de la Luz, who died giving birth to their daughter less than a year later, when he was 19. Their child was named in honor of Mar√≠a de la Luz. Six years later Mart√≠nez moved south after much thought and correspondence with the Bishop of Durango. He decided to travel there in 1817, and become a priest, enrolling in the Tridentine Seminary of the Diocese of Durango. Mart√≠nez not only excelled at the seminary but also in understanding the ideals of liberal Mexican politicians and teachers of his day, including Miguel Hidalgo. After six years, Mart√≠nez was ordained, and he returned to New Mexico, where after a few years in other parishes, he became the parish priest of Taos, and from then on was known as Padre Mart√≠nez.  American period  In 1841, the newly formed Republic of Texas recognized the difficulties New Mexico was facing and decided to take advantage of them by sending an expedition to invade New Mexico and possibly annex the territory. The invasion failed, and the Texans were captured by Manuel Armijo. This event, in addition to the numerous Americans already living in New Mexico, led many to believe that New Mexico had weakened and become ready for invasion. The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began in 1846. Stephen W. Kearny led 1,700 American troops into Santa Fe without encountering any resistance. Before the invasion, Mart√≠nez had witnessed the animosity towards Native Americans and Mexicans displayed by the Anglos living in New Mexico. He encouraged his students to study law and it was to them he delivered his famous quote, \\"The American government resembles a burro; but on this burro lawyers will ride, not priests.\\" Within a year of the American occupation, the Taos Revolt occurred. Charles Bent, the newly appointed American governor of New Mexico, was assassinated in the uprising. American forces quickly regained power, instituted martial law, and executed the rebels involved. Many, including Kit Carson, believed Mart√≠nez himself took part in some way in instigating the rebellion, but nothing has been proven. In a letter to a friend in Santa Fe, Mart√≠nez stated that the American reprisals were too harsh and would hinder future relations between New Mexico and its new rulers. Despite the problems, Mart√≠nez was able to adjust to the administration and for seven years played a dominant role in the conventions and legislative sessions of the new Territory. = Bishop Lamy = With the new government came new leadership, both political and religious. Jean Baptiste Lamy, a Frenchman nearly 21 years younger than Mart√≠nez, became the vicar apostolic of Santa Fe in 1851. Mart√≠nez supported Lamy until January 1854 when Lamy issued a letter instituting mandatory tithing and decreeing that heads of families that failed to tithe be denied the sacraments. Mart√≠nez publicly protested the letter and openly contested it in the secular press. From then on, Lamy and Mart√≠nez clashed over many issues, such as the effects of frontier life on Catholic standards, and women's issues. The two also argued over interpretations of canon law. The situation culminated when Lamy wrote a letter explaining that he felt New Mexicans faced a sad future because they didn't have the intellectual liveliness of Americans and their morals were primitive. These comments outraged New Mexicans. The clergy of New Mexico wrote a letter directly to the Pope, expressing their concern about Lamy. Mart√≠nez was not involved in the letter but continued to write communiques criticizing Lamy for the Santa Fe Gazette. In early 1856, Mart√≠nez offered his conditional resignation, but admitted his parishioners in Taos, New Mexico to his private chapel in his home and ministered to them from there. On October 27, 1856, Lamy suspended Mart√≠nez. In response, Mart√≠nez antagonized the pastor that Lamy sent in his place, persuaded a neighboring priest of his goals and gained the allegiance of approximately a third of the parishioners in the two parishes. Finally, in April 1858, Lamy excommunicated Mart√≠nez. Mart√≠nez never recognized the validity of the excommunication, and continued to minister to his supporters until his death. Mart√≠nez also continued to write about Christianity, publishing his famous work, Religi√≥n, in which he called for small honoraria for priests in New Mexico, because of the heavy demands associated with New Mexico's isolation. He also explained the problem of denying sacraments to individuals because of their financial status. Lastly, he condemned the Inquisition and all the actions associated with it, including the many excommunications. Death and legacy The grave of Fr. Mart√≠nez Father Antonio Jos√© Mart√≠nez died on July 27, 1867. Infirm and aged beyond his years, Mart√≠nez lived the last ten years of his life estranged from Bishop Jean Baptiste Lamy. By the spring of 1858, Bishop Lamy felt compelled to excommunicate Mart√≠nez not for moral failings, but for his \\"scandalous writings.\\" Bishop Lamy wrote his denunciation of Mart√≠nez in the marginal notes of the Baptism and Funeral Register of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church where he had served since 1826. The writings in La Gaceta of Santa Fe were a critique of the Bishop's re-introduction of the system of tithing that Mart√≠nez since 1829 successfully advocated the government revoke. In 1826, he established a coed elementary school; in 1833 a seminary from which 16 men were ordained to the priesthood; and in 1846 a law school that graduated many of the earliest lawyers and politicians of the Territory of New Mexico. He produced a speller for the children of his family members, and later obtained the first printing press in New Mexico. In 1838, he published his autobiography on his press, and the following year published the first book printed in New Mexico, a bilingual ritual‚ÄîLatin and Spanish. He published only six issues of the newspaper called El Crep√∫sculo de Libertad; published religious/devotional tracts and texts for his elementary school, seminary, and law school. Mart√≠nez was a licensed attorney turned politician, and served five times under the Republic of Mexico on the legislature of the Departamento de Nuevo Mexico, and six times for the Territory of New Mexico under the United States. He was married before he became a priest; his wife died in childbirth, and his daughter died at the young age of 12. Even after ordination, Mart√≠nez had other children that he recognized as heirs in his Last Will and Testament. His eldest was Santiago Valdez (b. 1830) who wrote his 1877 biography, and the second to the youngest was Vicente Ferrer Romero (b. 1844) who became an effective evangelizer for the Presbyterian Church. Mart√≠nez has been accused of instigating the Chimay√≥ Rebellion of 1837 and the Taos Revolt of 1847 with its concomitant assassination of Governor Charles Bent, but this is unlikely. After his tension and controversies with Bishop Lamy, it seems he flirted with becoming an Anglican. However. he remained staunchly Roman Catholic as his Last Will and Testament testifies. In his Last Will, Mart√≠nez expressed a desire not to have a public ceremony, nevertheless there was a large funeral ceremony for him. Mart√≠nez requested to be buried in his Oratorio, dedicated to La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, contiguous to and on the west-side of his residence. This request was honored, and so he was buried in his own Oratorio that he had built on his property. A quarter century later in 1891, his body was moved about two miles east the American Cemetery. The land, originally owned by Mart√≠nez, was deeded to Theodora Romero, and then came into possession of the Kit Carson park and cemetery in Taos. Inscribed on the Mart√≠nez tombstone are the words La Honra de su Pa√≠s (\\"The Honor of his Homeland\\"). Mart√≠nez's peers in the Territorial Legislature pronounced this encomium in 1867, the year of his death. Sculptor Huberto Maestas of San Luis, Colorado sculpted the larger than life-sized bronze memorial of Mart√≠nez unveiled at Taos Plaza on July 16, 2006.  Controversy  =Revolution of 1837= When Santa Anna became the President of Mexico in 1833, he intentionally began to centralize and departmentalize the Mexican government. Santa Anna also began to impose harsher taxes in New Mexico, which sparked a rebellion in the northern part of the province. In 1837, the rebels, mostly poorer ranchers and farmers, captured Santa Fe, killed governor Albino P√©rez, and installed their own governor, Jos√© Gonzales. The leaders of the rebellion were divided on their goals and soon factionalized. American merchants and traders within New Mexico were uncomfortable about the new government and funded a Mexican army led by Manuel Armijo to put down the uprising. The Mart√≠nez family had grown wealthy through trade and would have become a critical subject had the rebellion survived. Mart√≠nez not only helped fund the Mexican army, but also offered his services to Armijo as chaplain of the army until the termination of the revolt in early 1838, when the old administration was restored with Armijo as governor. Upon suppression of the rebellion, Armijo ordered the execution of Jos√© Gonzales, but not before directing Mart√≠nez: \\"Padre Martƒ∫nez, confiese √° este genƒ∫zaro para que le d√©n cinco balazos\\" (\\"Father Martƒ∫nez, hear this genizaro's confession so that he may be shot five times\\"). Mart√≠nez heard Gonzales's confession and then handed him over to Armijo. =Penitentes= Following Mexican independence from Spain, Church authorities in Mexico withdrew the Franciscan, Dominican and Jesuit missionaries from its provinces. In 1832, the last of the Franciscan regional authorities authorized Padre Mart√≠nez to supervise the Penitente brotherhood, a type of folk Catholicism that had developed among the Hispano New Mexicans. In addition to offering spiritual and social aid to the community, the Penitentes engaged in such ascetic practices as flagellation and the carrying of heavy crosses. Bishop Lamy unsuccessfully attempted to suppress the brotherhood as a part of the \\"Americanization\\" of the Church in New Mexico. Padre Mart√≠nez championed the Penitente cause, putting him squarely at odds with Lamy.  Quotes  Charles Bent's statement about the \\"greate literary Martinez\\" and similar comments are sarcastic. Bent felt a strong antipathy toward Padre Antonio Jos√© Mart√≠nez who opposed his ambition to acquire the Guadalupe-Miranda (Beaubien) Land Grant / Maxwell Land Grant. Padre Martinez insisted that the extremely large territory, over 1.7 million acres including what is today Philmont Scout Ranch, remain common grazing grounds the inhabitants of New Mexico since time immemorial used for their cattle. In the early 1830s Charles Bent, together with his brother William, founded a fort on the Arkansas River (the Spanish called it Rio Napiste) in what is today's southern Colorado. The river marked the southern boundary between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain since the Otis-Anin Treaty of 1819. A couple of years later‚Äîafter Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821‚Äîthe river became the northern boundary of the Republic of Mexico with the United States. Bent's Fort was, therefore, located at a very strategic place for international commerce. It became a headquarters for French Canadian and American fur trappers and traders who‚Äîthrough the American Fur Company‚Äîsuccessfully exported beaver pelts, in the form of top hats, to the salons of Paris and London. In the spring or early summer of 1846, during the time of US-Mexican War, Charles Bent visited Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, leader of the Army of the West at Forth Leavenworth, Kansas. Together with a large contingent of his army, Kearny gathered at Bent's Fort by the end of June in preparation to march on Santa Fe on behalf of the Government of the United States to take possession of New Mexico that belonged to the Republic of Mexico. Padre Martinez, the priest of Taos, had been a Mexican nationalist. He had been ordained a priest in Durango, Mexico a year after Mexican Independence, and considered Padre Miguel Hidalgo (Father of Mexican Independence) a hero and mentor. At the same time, he considered George Washington as another of his hero-mentors. Padre Martinez appreciated the ideals spelled out in the American Constitution and Bill of Rights. Although Padre Martinez had resisted U.S. encroachment into New Mexico since the early 1840s, he eventually came to believe that New Mexico would be better off under the flag of the United States. Before coming into Santa Fe, Kearny was aware that Padre Martinez was the main religious and political leader in northern New Mexico and throughout the whole region. Kearny, ironically, dispatched Captain Bent with a dozen soldiers to escort Padre Martinez and his brothers from Taos to Santa Fe in order to pledge allegiance to the American Flag. Because of their convictions, and in order to attempt avoiding bloodshed in the civil transfer of power, they willingly complied, thus becoming the first inhabitants of New Mexico to become citizens of the United States. Moreover, Colonel Kearny asked Padre Martinez to borrow his Ramage printing press on which the Padre had published New Mexico's first book, a newspaper, as well as religious and educational materials. The Padre lent the press to the Colonel soon-to-be promoted to Brigadier General, and Kearny used it to publish his Code of Laws. The quote attributed to Padre Martinez about the clergyman/attorney riding the burrow is from an 1877 unpublished manuscript by Santiago Valdez in Spanish belonging to the Ritch Collection housed at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, near Los Angeles: Biografia del Presb√≠tero Antonio Jos√© Mart√≠nez, Cura de Taos. Padre Martinez made the statement in September 1846, a few weeks after General Stephen Watts Kearny had, on August 18 in the name of the United States of America, occupied Santa Fe and all of New Mexico.

Muhammad was an early supporter of his own brother King Abdulaziz. However, Muhammad and Abdulaziz had a falling-out after both attempted to place their respective sons in line for kingship. This conflict may have led to the death of Muhammad's son Khalid. Muhammad later became a virtual non-entity in Saudi politics. Biography There is some controversy regarding the date of his birth, with some sources making him older than his brother, the future king Abdulaziz, an important factor in his later maneuvering for succession to rule. In a publication by his family his birth year is given as 1877. It is also stated that he was born in Riyadh and was younger than King Abdulaziz. His mother was Sara bint Jiluwi bin Turki Al Jiluwi. He followed his family to exile in Kuwait after the collapse of the Saudi state in 1891. In 1902 he was one of Abdulaziz's companions on the raid which retook the Masmak Castle and Riyadh. Muhammad and Saud Al Kabeer led the forces which helped Abdulaziz in the battle of Kanzan in 1915. Only through their assistance Abdulaziz managed to defeat the Al Ajman tribe who surrounded Abdulaziz's forces for almost six months after killing Abdulaziz's younger brother Saad and wounding Abdulaziz. In late 1920 Muhammad and Prince Saud bin Abdualaziz was sent to Hail to capture the province. Following complete control over Saudi Arabia by the Al Sauds, Muhammad was appointed governor of Mecca. However, he claimed much more powerful position for himself and for his son, Khalid, in King Abdulaziz's government which was not met. To achieve his goals Muhammed attempted to eliminate Prince Saud, King Abdulaziz's eldest son, in 1927 and in 1930 which were both unsuccessful. Then, in 1935 Muhammad left Riyadh and settled in Mecca. Personal life and death One of the early palaces following the establishment of the Kingdom was built by Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman outside the walls of Riyadh and the building is called Atiqah Palace. One of Muhammad's wives was Hassa bint Ahmad Al Sudairi, who was the mother of Sudairi Seven. They had a son, Abdullah bin Muhammad. Muhammad's another spouse was Munira bint Abdullah Al Shaikh who was the sister of Tarfa bint Abdullah, mother of King Faisal. His eldest son, Khalid bin Muhammad (1904‚Äì1938), married to King Faisal's only full sister, Noura, in 1934, and he was killed in car crash on Al Dahna and Kuwait road. One of Khalid's daughters, Al Jawhara, married to Abdullah bin Faisal, one of King Faisal's sons. Muhammad's other son, Fahd (1904‚Äì?), also married to King Abdulaziz's daughter Sheikha and was one the former governors of Al Qassim Province. His grandson Fahd bin Abdullah bin Muhammad is former deputy defence minister. One of Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman's great grandsons, Khalid bin Saud, was a high- ranking official at the ministry of foreign affairs. The daughter of Khalid bin Saud is married to Saud bin Khalid, son of Khalid bin Faisal, governor of Makkah Province and son of late King Faisal. His other great-grandchildren are directors of King Faisal Foundation. For instance, Bandar bin Saud bin Khalid Al Saud is the deputy managing director of the foundation. Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman died in Mecca on 25 July 1943.

Biography  The Herrmann-Maas-Haus in Heidelberg-Kirchheim. Maas was born in Gengenbach in the Schwarzwald, Germany. In 1903, he started working as a Protestant minister in a parish of Evangelical Church in Baden. At the same time he began to make the acquaintance of Zionist Jews, and formed friendly relations with many of them, having attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel that year. Since 1918, he had been an active member of the pro- democratic left-liberal DDP. Maas, who had decidedly liberal and pacifist views, caused a scandal in 1925 by attending the funeral of social democratic Reichspr√§sident Friedrich Ebert. Conservative German pastors considered this to be an affront to the church because Ebert had been an outspoken atheist. In 1932, Maas joined an association for protection against antisemitism. In 1933, when the Nazi regime introduced the economic boycott of the Jews of Germany, Maas first went to Palestine to meet with some of the Zionist activists, impressing them by speaking fluent Hebrew. Upon his return to Heidelberg he faced harsh criticism as a \\"Jew-lover\\". After Hitler's Machtergreifung, he joined the Pfarrernotbund and the Confessing Church along with other notable Protestant theologians such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Niem√∂ller and Hans Ehrenberg. In the early 1940s, Maas helped many Jews flee from Germany by using his connections to obtain exit visas. In mid-1943, on the instigation of the Nazi regime the Superior Church Council of the Baden Church forced him out of office for his activism. In 1944, he was sent to a forced-labor camp in France, from which he was later released by the US forces. In 1945 he resumed work as minister for the Baden Church. In 1950, Maas was the first non-Jewish German to be officially invited to the newly formed state of Israel. On July 28, 1964, Yad Vashem decided to recognize Reverend Hermann Maas as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. He died on 27 September 1970 in Mainz-Weisenau.

It is one of a very few aviation museums located at an airport which serves as a major hub (Charlotte is the #2 hub for American Airlines). Its centerpiece attraction is the Airbus A320 used on US Airways Flight 1549. Overview The museum was founded in 1992 by Floyd and Lois Peithman Wilson, and has a collection of over 50 static aircraft and many smaller historic items related to aviation in North Carolina and South Carolina. Most of the collection consists of Cold War military aircraft, including several historic jet aircraft from the 1950s and 1960s. Several aircraft came from the closed Florence Air & Missile Museum, in Florence, South Carolina. A significant number of aircraft have also come from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and Marine Corps Air Station New River. The museum no longer operates flying aircraft, however, due to its location on Charlotte-Douglas International Airport property, it has on occasion hosted historic aircraft for fly-ins. Those aircraft include the B-17, B-24, B-29 and Berlin Airlift C-54. Until April 2010, the museum was located in the airport's original 1932 hangar, built by the Works Progress Administration. The museum moved into a new facility at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport at 4672 First Flight Drive. The new facility enabled the majority of the aircraft to be inside a climate-controlled facility and allowed for new displays. In October 2012, the museum became a Smithsonian affiliate. In July 2019, the museum closed to the public and all aircraft were moved into temporary storage in preparation for the new facility. The museum is currently working to develop plans for a new location with a planned re-opening in 2022.

Sullenberger's and First Officer Skiles's uniforms On 15 January 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport for a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, when multiple bird strikes a few minutes after takeoff forced a ditching in the Hudson River. The ditching and subsequent rescue operations were accomplished without loss of life. The aircraft, an A320-214, was eventually recovered from the river. Flight 1549 landing on the waters of the North River In January 2011, the Carolinas Aviation Museum acquired the entire airframe from the insurance company, AIG, who donated the aircraft to the museum. The airframe was transported by road from its storage location at J Supor & Son Trucking & Rigging Co. Inc. in Kearny, New Jersey to the museum at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte. The transportation took 7 days, between June 4 and June 10, 2011, and covered 788 miles through New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia & North Carolina. Because the fuselage was transported in one piece, as it was when it was recovered from the river, the truck was 190 feet long. Virtually everything except the passengers' personal belongings are still in the airplane. The landing gear pins, fire axe, and the manuals were still in the cockpit, and the Coke cans were still in the beverage carts. The airframe has been reassembled and was on display from 2011 to 2019 in the same configuration as it was when it was pulled out of the Hudson River in January 2009. The airframe is being conserved as opposed to restored with dents from the birds and tugboat. In addition to the airframe, Captain Sullenberger and First Officer Skiles have contributed their uniforms to the museum's 1549 exhibit. The aircraft arrived in June 2011, and reassembly of the main components took about one year. The engines arrived in May 2012 and were planned to be reassembled in time for the fourth anniversary of the landing in the Hudson (January 15, 2013). The museum opened a major new exhibit surrounding Flight 1549 with artifacts such as Captain Sullenberger's uniform in August 2012. The aircraft is currently in storage as the museum designs a new facility, set to open in 2022.

Wise Blood, an opera based on the novel by Flannery O'Connor His opera Wise Blood, based on the novel Wise Blood by Flannery O'Connor, premiered in June 2015 in collaboration with Minnesota-based media artist Chris Larson. With a cross-media libretto written by Gatto after the novel by Flannery O'Connor, the immersive opera exhibition was co-commissioned and co-presented by the Walker Art Center and The Soap Factory.

Gatto's contemporary style is somber and atmospheric, veering from unsettlingly clamorous to eerily serene. Though there are comic moments in the show, laughter dies quickly and may be replaced by tears; in its total effect, the piece is almost an American requiem.\\" See several excerpts and the full video of the Minneapolis 2015 performances of the opera Wise Blood here. The Making of Americans, an opera based on the novel by Gertrude Stein Gatto's opera, The Making of Americans, based on the novel by Gertrude Stein, was commissioned by the Walker Art Center and premiered in two sold-out shows in December 2008.

He was held in the United States Guantanamo Bay detainment camp in Cuba. He was released in late May 2014 in a prisoner exchange that involved Bowe Bergdahl and the Taliban five. Press reports have referred to him as \\"Mullah\\" and \\"Maulavi\\", two different honorifics for referring to senior Muslim clerics. Claims from analysts at Guantanamo that Khairkhwa was directly associated with Osama Bin Laden and Taliban Supreme Commander Mullah Muhammad Omar have been widely repeated. Kate Clark has criticized her fellow journalists for uncritically repeating U.S. claims that were largely based on unsubstantiated rumor and innuendo, or on confessions and denunciations coerced through torture and other extreme interrogation techniques. Early life American intelligence analysts estimate that Khairkhwa was born in 1967 in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He is a Popalzai from Arghestan in Kandahar province. He studied religious topics at the Haqqaniya and Akhora Khattak madrassas in Pakistan, together with other influential Taliban leaders. He held various government posts before the Taliban took over Afghanistan, including a police official in Kabul, and finally, Governor of Herat Province. Khirullah was one of the original Taliban members who launched the movement in 1994. Khairullah Khairkhwah was the Minister of the Interior under Taliban rule in 1997 and 1998. The Deputy Minister was Mohammad Khaksar. Some reports have said he had been the Taliban's deputy minister of the interior, interim minister of the interior, the minister of the interior, and the Minister of Information. Khirullah was also to serve as the Taliban's Minister of Foreign Affairs spokesman, giving interviews to the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America. Kate Clark, then of the BBC News, interviewed Khairkhwa in September 2000. Clark wrote that Khairkhwa was comfortable conversing in the Dari language when most Taliban leaders, all members of Afghanistan's Pashtun ethnic group, would only speak in the Pashtun language. She wrote that under Khairkhwa, she was allowed to film openly in Herat, even though doing so was disallowed under Taliban law. She wrote that under Khairkhwa, Afghan women felt comfortable approaching her, and speaking with her, something that never happened in other regions of Afghanistan. According to journalist Mark Mazzetti, in February 2002, Khairkhwa and alleged CIA agent Ahmed Wali Karzai discussed the possibility of Khairkhwa surrendering and informing for the CIA. However, the deal broke down and Khairkhwa fled for Pakistan; the CIA learned of his flight through a communications intercept and the U.S. military dispatched a helicopter-borne commando team to capture Khairkhwa. However, the CIA hoped to allow the Pakistanis to recruit or capture Khairkhwa, which would also boost U.S.-Pakistan relations. Thus, the CIA recalled the drone following Khairkhwa's truck and a second drone pinpointed a different truck, whose innocent occupants were captured and later released. Khairkhwa successfully crossed into Pakistan at Spin Boldak, but after further talks over informing broke down, Khairkhwa was arrested by the Pakistanis in Chaman, transferred to the CIA in Quetta, and then sent to Guantanamo. Khirullah Khairkhwa arrived at Guantanamo on May 1, 2002, and had been held there for 12 years. In early 2011, President Hamid Karzai demanded his release and Hekmat Karzai, the director of the Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies in Kabul said \\"His release will be influential to the peace process,\\" and that \\"Mr Khairkhwa is well respected amongst the Taliban and was considered a moderate by those who knew him\\". Official status reviews Originally, the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions and could be held indefinitely without charge and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Following the Supreme Court's ruling. the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 200, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was listed as one of the captives who the military alleges were members of either al Qaeda or the Taliban and associated with the other group. * Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.\\" * Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was listed as one of the captives who was a member of the Taliban leadership. * Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was listed as one of \\"36 [captives who] openly admit either membership or significant association with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or some other group the government considers militarily hostile to the United States.\\" * Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was listed as one of the captives who had admitted \\"being [a] Taliban leader.\\" =Joint Review Task Force= On January 21, 2009, the day he was inaugurated, United States President Barack Obama issued three Executive orders related to the detention of individuals in Guantanamo. He put in place a new review system composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Khairullah Khairkhwa was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release. Obama said those deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board. =Periodic Review Board= The first review wasn't convened until November 20, 2013. Khairkhwa and the other four members of the Taliban Five are the only \\"forever prisoners\\" to be released without being cleared by a review. Release negotiations The Afghanistan High Peace Council called for his release in 2011. Throughout the fall of 2011 and the winter of 2012, the United States conducted peace negotiations with the Taliban and widely leaked that a key sticking point was the ongoing detention of Khairkhwa and four other senior Taliban, Norullah Noori, Mohammed Fazl, Abdul Haq Wasiq. Negotiations hinged on a proposal to send the five men directly to Doha, Qatar, where they would be allowed to set up an official office for the Taliban. In March 2012, it was reported that Ibrahim Spinzada, described as \\"Karzai's top aide\\" had spoken with the five men in Guantanamo earlier that month and had secured their agreement to be transferred to Qatar. Karzai, who had initially opposed the transfer, then reportedly backed the plan. Release Khairkhwa and the other four members of the Taliban five were flown to Qatar and released on June 1, 2014. Simultaneously, U.S. soldier and deserter Bowe Bergdahl was released in eastern Afghanistan. Khairkhwa was required to spend the next year in Qatar, a condition of his and the other Taliban members, release. In 2015, CNN reported that Khairkhwa had recommenced terrorist activity after his release in exchange for Bergdahl. References External links * Who Are the Remaining Prisoners in Guant√°namo?

It lasted until its replacement by the imperial examination system during the Sui Dynasty. In Confucian philosophy, filial piety is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors.[Confucianism in Context Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond] Under the advice of Dong Zhongshu, Emperor Wu ordered each district to recommend one filial and one incorrupt candidate for civil offices. Later the nomination became proportional; Emperor He of Han changed the proportion to one candidate for every 200,000 residents, and one for every 100,000 residents in ethnic minority regions. The nominator was also responsible if the nominee was charged with corruption, and could be punished if he refused to nominate qualified individuals. After the Han dynasty, high positions were usually nominated according to the Nine-rank system, so Xiaolian became increasingly unimportant.

Poetry in Brief, The Independent She spent the first sixty years of her life in Romania until she moved to the USA in 1985 for a teaching job. A few years later Cassian was granted permanent asylum and New York City became her home for the rest of her life. Much of her work was published both in Romanian and in English.  Life and Work  = Early life = Nina Cassian was born into a Jewish family in Gala≈£i in 1924, the only child of Iosif Cassian-MƒÉtƒÉsaru, a translator, and an amateur singer. In 1926 the family moved to Bra»ôov. Cassian‚Äôs fascination is said to date back to that time of her childhood since this is when she started spending time with children form the German and Hungarian community. In 1935, the family moved to Bucharest, where Cassian attended a girl's high school in the Jewish ghetto. Over the years she took drawing lessons with George Loewendal and M. H. Maxy, acting lessons with Beate Fredanov and Alexandru Fin»õi, piano and musical composition lessons with Theodor Fuchs, Paul Jelescu, Mihail Jora and Constantin Silvestri. In 1944 she entered the Literature Department of Bucharest University, but abandoned her studies after one year. = Life in Communist Romania = In the mid-40s Cassian started to find her place in the literary scene in Romania. She was married to the young poet Vladimir Colin in 1943 (their marriage lasted until 1948) and had a very close relation with Ion Barbu. Most interestingly though, Cassian also formed a very close friendship with the famous french poet Paul Celan when he lived in Bucharest between 1945 and 1947. Along with other writers and artists Celan and Cassian played surrealist such as \\"Questions and Answers\\" or \\"Ioachim\\" which is the Bucharest version of Bretons famous game Exquisite Corpse. Cassian and Celan bonded over their fascination for languages and used multilingualism as an inspiration for their work. In 1945 Cassian published her first poem, Am fost un poet decadent (\\"I Used to Be a Decadent Poet\\") in the daily Rom√¢nia liberƒÉ, and her first poetry collection, La scara 1/1 (\\"Scale 1:1\\") in 1947. These early publications were greatly influenced by French modernist poets she had spent time with, especially the surrealist writers are said to have had a lasting influence on Cassian. It was labeled \\"decadent poetry\\" in a Sc√Ænteia article in 1948. Scared by that fierce criticism, she then turned to writing in the proletkult and socialist-realistic fashion. This phase lasted for about eight years. This is also when Cassian turned to writing children's books, such as Copper Red and the Seven Dachsies (which was published in English in 1985 after it had become a bestseller in Romania), and children's stories, such as Tigrino and Tigrene (which was written in verse and published in English in 1986, adapted from the Romanian original Pocestea A Doi Pui de Tigru, Numiti Ninigra Si Aligru). In an interview in 1986, she explains why she made the choice to focus on children's literature: ‚ÄúIt was in 1950, during the dogmativ period in Romania. Socialist realism is, unfortunately, characterized by the restraining of structures and styles and vocabulary. [...] So when I was asked to write in a rigid and simplified manner, I tried to do my best, but after awhile, I switched to literature for children because it was the only field where metaphors were still allowed, where imagination was tolerated and assonance was permitted.‚Äù At least some of her children's stories and books have been translated to English but are not available in bookstores anymore today. Cassian was later married to Al. I. ≈ûtefƒÉnescu. Although born into a Jewish family, he was Romanian Orthodox, and during their marriage, she stated that she was much closer to his religion than to Judaism, and that she had never read a page of the Talmud. = Exodus and Life in the USA = Cassian travelled to the United States as a visiting professor for creative writing at the New York University in 1985. During her stay in America, a friend of hers, Gheorghe Ursu, was arrested and subsequently beaten to death by the Securitate for possessing a diary. The diary contained several of Cassian's poems which satirized the Communist regime and the authorities thought to be inflammatory. Hence, she decided to remain in the US. She was granted asylum in the United States, and continued to live in New York City.Gray, Channing (19 June 2008). Poet, composer, refugee at URI, The Providence Journal Eventually, she became an American citizen. In the US, she started writing poems in English and published in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly and other magazines. Some of these poems were also published in collections, for example Life Sentence in 1990 and Take My Word for It in 1998, both of which are still available today. In the US, she was married to Maurice Edwards. Cassian died of a cardiac arrest or heart attack in New York on 14 April 2014. She is survived by her husband.

Early life Erroll was the son of William Hay, 17th Earl of Erroll, and his wife Alice (n√©e Eliot). His paternal grandfather was James Hay, 15th Earl of Erroll, son of William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock (who was attainted with his titles forfeited in 1746). He became heir apparent to the earldom in 1815 on the death of his elder brother, Lord Hay, who was killed during the Waterloo Campaign. He was educated at Eton.  Career  Erroll succeeded his father in the earldom in 1819, aged 18. In 1823 he was elected a Scottish Representative Peer and took his seat in the House of Lords. He was Master of the Horse to Queen Adelaide from 1830 to 1834. In 1831 he was sworn of the Privy Council and created Baron Kilmarnock, of Kilmarnock in the County of Ayr, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, a revival of the Kilmarnock title held by his great-grandfather. When the Whigs came to power under Lord Melbourne in 1835, Erroll was appointed Master of the Buckhounds.

The dispute has been the subject of many formal land claims since the 1970s, and several instances of direct action in the form of protests, blockades, and occupations. The dispute focuses on land along the length of the Grand River that was granted to Indigenous allies of the British Crown in the eighteenth century to make up for territorial losses suffered during the American Revolutionary War and as a result of the Treaty of Paris (1783). The dispute came to wide attention in Canada in 2006 when the Six Nations formally reactivated litigation against Canada and Ontario initially brought in 1995. Protesters from the Six Nations of the Grand River began a demonstration to raise awareness about First Nation land claims in Ontario, Canada, highlighting their claim to a parcel of land in Caledonia, Ontario, a community within the single-tier municipality of Haldimand County, roughly 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of Hamilton. Soon after this demonstration, the demonstrators took control of the disputed land, the planned site of a subdivision Douglas Creek Estates. The land, along with all of Caledonia, is part of the plot of land originally known as the Haldimand Tract, which was granted in 1784 by the British Crown-in-Council to the Six Nations of the Grand River for their use in settlement.Map of the 1784 Haldimand Tract, reclamation.kisikew.org (moved to reclamation.kisikew.org - site owner) In 2020, the dispute once again entered public consciousness with Mohawk protesters blockading Highway 6 in February and March as part of the 2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests in solidarity with the Wet ºsuwet ºen, and later with the occupation of the site another planned subdivision, McKenzie Meadows, renamed 1492 Land Back Lane by the protesters, self-proclaimed \\"land defenders\\". Background =18th century= * May 22, 1784 - Frederick Haldimand purchases land along the Grand River from the Mississauga nation. * October 25, 1784 - In return for military support provided by member states of the Six Nations during the American Revolution, the British Crown provides these nations with territory to replace lands ceded south of the Great Lakes via the Haldimand Proclamation. A contingent of Haudenosaunee people led by Brant decides to settle at the Grand River. The nations' new, shared, territory extends from either side of the Grand River, from its source to its termination at Lake Erie. As of November 2006, Henco Industries claims that the Haldimand Grant was a licence to occupy the land, with title remaining with the Crown. * 1791 - Sir John Johnson, who had been placed in charge of managing the resettlement of the Haudenosaunee, notices an error regarding the northern boundary of the Haldimand Tract. He found that the headwaters of the Grand River did not fall within the land purchased from the Mississaugas in 1784. The Crown's surveyor Augustus Jones redefines the boundary of the Six Nations' parcel, establishing straight-lined boundaries, including Jones Baseline, which provided the northern boundary of the newly- defined parcel, around the later location of Guelph. * December 1792 - The Crown purchases the remainder of the land included in the Haldimand Grant (ie up to the actual headwaters of the Grand River) from the Mississaugas, but does not transfer it to Six Nations. * January 14, 1793 - Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe confirms the grant with a limited deed, known as the Simcoe Patent, or the Crown Grant to the Six Nations or the Haldimand Tract, no. 4. The Simcoe Patent limits the Haldimand Tract to for the exclusive use of the Six Nations, leaving the rest of the land available to be leased, surrendered, or sold by the Haudenosaunee to the Crown. It does not address the issue of the territory around the headwaters. Brant and the other Six Nations chiefs reject the patent and claim it is not binding on them. * 1796 - The Six Nations grant its chief, Joseph Brant, the power of attorney to sell off some of the land and invest the proceeds to provide annuity for tribal members, who were struggling to survive in the new settlements. The Crown initially opposes the sales but eventually concedes. * c. 1794-6 - Joseph Brant begins selling land to private interests, having reached a deal with Peter Russell that allowed him to sell and lease the land so long as it was offered first to the Crown. Ultimately, he sells , an area comprising the northern half of the reserve, for ¬£85,332. The interest on the annuity promises an income of ¬£5,119 per year, far more than any other Iroquois people had received up until that point. * February 5, 1798 - The land sold by Brant to the Crown is parcelled off into six blocks and sold to private land speculators. These blocks later developed into towns as follows: ** Block No. 1 - Township of Dumfries (later North Dumfries and South Dumfries Township, incorporated in 1819) ** Block No. 2 - Waterloo Township (incorporated in 1816) ** Block No. 3 - Pilkington Township in Wellington County, and Woolwich Township (incorporated in 1816) ** Block No. 4 - Nichol Township in Wellington County (opened for settlement in 1822) ** Block No. 5 - Moulton Township in Haldimand County ** Block No. 6 - Canborough Township in Haldimand County = 19th century = * 1801 - All of the land speculators have fallen behind in their payments due to being unable to sell farm-size lots to settlers fast enough to keep up. * 1828 - Nearly two thirds of the Grand River territory has been sold, leased, or occupied by squatters. * 1835 - The Crown approaches the Six Nations about developing Plank Road (now Highway 6) and the surrounding area. The Six Nations agree to lease half a mile of land on each side for the road but did not surrender the land. Lieutenant-Governor John Colborne agrees to the lease but later, his successor, Sir Francis Bond Head, does not. * 1840 - The government recommends that a reserve of approximately be established on the south side of the Grand River and the rest sold or leased to the Crown in order to protect them from encroaching squatters. * January 18, 1841 - According to the Crown, the Six Nations council agrees to surrender for sale all the lands outside those set aside for a reserve, on the agreement that the government would sell the land and invest the money for them. * February 4, 1841 - The Six Nations petition against the surrender of land, saying the chiefs had been intimidated and deceived and they had agreed only to lease the land. * July 7, 1841 - There is another petition against the surrender. * 1843 - A further petition to the Crown says the Six Nations need a reserve of and want to keep and lease a tier of lots on each side of Plank Road (Highway 6) and several other tracts of land within the territory laid out by the Haldimand Proclamation. * December 18, 1844 - A surrender is signed by 47 Six Nations chiefs that authorizes the sale of land to build Plank Road. * 1845 - Starting this year, despite the protests of Six Nations citizens, the Crown sells Plank Road and surrounding lands to third parties. * May 15, 1848 - The land that would later be the site of the development of Douglas Creek Estates is sold to George Marlot Ryckman for 57 pounds and 10 shillings; a Crown deed of title is issued to him. * 1850 - The Crown passes a proclamation setting the extent of reserve lands to about , which is agreed to by the Six Nations chiefs. = 20th century = * 1924 - Under the Indian Act, the Government of Canada establishes an elected band government on the Six Nations reserve. * 1931 - The Statute of Westminster is put into effect; the parliament of the United Kingdom relinquishes the ability to legislate on behalf of Canada. All Canadian First Nations affairs are now fully within the jurisdiction of the Canadian Crown. * 1974 - The Six Nations Land Claims Research Office (SNLCRO) is created by Six Nations to pursue the terms laid out in the Haldimand Proclamation. * 1974-1995 - SNLCRO submits 29 separate land claims to the Specific Claims Branch of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. * 1995 - After only one of the 29 submitted land claims is resolved, the Government of Canada closes the rest (including those already validated for negotiation), because they receive notice of pending litigation from Six Nations.  Canadian National Railway Settlement  In 1980, the Six Nations Council, along with SNLCRO, submitted a claim to Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada against Canadian National Railway's unauthorized use of reserve land for a stretch of rail that runs along the eastern end of the reserve (near the site of the later Douglas Creek Estates dispute). The First Nation eventually accepted a settlement in 1987 that consisted of $610,000 in the form of three parcels of land added to the reserve, which added approximately . The Council also retained the right to purchase said railway lands if they were not used for railway purposes and were re-acquired by Canada.  Douglas Creek Estates (Kanonhstaton)  In 1992, Henco Industries Ltd. purchased of land for what it would later call the Douglas Creek Estates. The proposed subdivision was set to be located southeast of Caledonia, between Argyle Street South, 6th Line, the CN rail line, and the houses along Thistlemoor Drive. That land was part of an existing land claim submitted by the Six Nations Elected Council; the claim had been closed by 1995. In March of that year, the Six Nations sued the federal and provincial governments in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice over the developers' purchase of the land. The lawsuit is an accounting claim for \\"all assets which were not received but ought to have been received, managed or held by the Crown for the benefit of the Six Nations.\\" The case was openly litigated until 2004, when it was paused for \\"exploratory\\" negotiated settlement talks with the federal government. These talks were never pursued, due to the Douglas Creek Estates conflict in 2006. Regarding their right to purchase the land, Henco argued that the Six Nations had surrendered their rights to the land in 1841 and Henco had purchased it from the Government of Canada. The Six Nations, however, maintained that their title to the land was never relinquished, as their chiefs protested the 1841 surrender and sent a petition to the government arguing against the terms. In July 2005, the subdivision plan for Douglas Creek Estates was registered, with title to the property guaranteed by the province of Ontario. Starting in February 2006, community members from Six Nations occupied the site of the proposed development, which they named Kanonhstaton, \\"the protected place\\" in the Mohawk language. Direct action on the part of protesters over the years included blockade of roads and rail lines, damage to a power station resulting in an area blackout and more than $1 million in repairs, and low levels of violence from both sides, as well as isolated, more serious attacks. The government halted negotiations at times because of public danger from protesters' actions, such as blocking public roads. As protests continued, on June 12, 2006, more than 400 area residents and businesses filed a class-action suit against the Government of Ontario for its \\"failure to protect them adequately\\". This was settled in July 2011, with the government paying to class members. By the end of 2011, several criminal cases related to assaults had been prosecuted. During the continuing dispute, on June 16, 2006, the Government of Ontario announced it had bought the disputed tract from the developer and would hold it in trust until negotiations settled the claim. Talks began, including the Confederacy chiefs, but were put on hold in 2009 when litigation of the 1995 lawsuit was resumed. The trial is scheduled to start in October 2022. = Dispute Timeline (2005-2006) =  2005  = October = * October 26 - Six Nations Elected Council Chief David General writes to Henco, expressing concerns about the development proceeding on disputed lands. 2006 Occupation of Douglas Creek Estates = February = * February 28 - A group of community members from Six Nations erect tents, a tipi and a wooden building on the proposed development site. = March = * March 3 - Henco Industries, the developer of the land, obtains an injunction from Justice Matheson, ordering the protesters off the land. * March 5 - The Sheriff tries to deliver Justice Matheson's order to the protesters late Sunday evening. They do not accept the injunction. One of the protesters, Dawn Smith, burns the order. The burning is broadcast on local television. * March 6 - The protesters burn the order again. * March 10 - At Henco's request, motions judge Justice Marshall makes the March 3 court injunction permanent. He also adjourns Henco's contempt motion against the First Nations protesters to March 16, and he orders that the service of the contempt motion on the respondents could be effected by the same methods Justice Matheson had provided for service of the injunction order (ie by police). * March 17 - Justice Marshall makes a finding of contempt and orders the Sheriff to go to Douglas Creek Estates, read aloud the new contempt order along with the March 3 injunction, and distribute copies to anyone present. Finally, he orders that warrants of committal for contempt be issued. The protesters are given five days to leave the encampment. * March 22 - The deadline for occupiers to leave the site. They are still there, but the OPP do not enforce the injunction. = April = * April 4 - Several hundred people, including some who had bought homes in Douglas Creek Estates, gather in Caledonia to demand an end to the occupation. * April 19 - Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty says the land dispute will be settled in a \\"peaceful manner\\". * April 20 - More than three weeks after the second contempt order, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), reportedly armed with M16 rifles, tear gas, pepper spray, and tasers, go to the site of the occupation and arrest sixteen people at around 4:30 in the morning. * April 20 - Several hundred people from Six Nations, some of whom are masked and armed with bats, axes and hockey sticks, return to the site in the morning, and a further busload of supporters from other reserves arrive later in the evening. The police retreat and the protestors reclaim the site and set up roadblocks along the access street. During the evening, the protesters put hundreds of tires across the highway, and light them on fire. In addition, they set fire to a wooden bridge over the nearby railway tracks. Firefighters are unable to extinguish both fires because the fire chief is concerned the OPP are not able to adequately protect his men. Several boxes of documents from the land developer's office inside a model home are taken, and some are tossed into a bonfire. * April 20 - In solidarity with the protesters at Kanonhstaton, a group of Mohawks raise a banner and Mohawk flags on a bridge near Montreal, blocking traffic for about a half hour. * April 21 - Several members of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte First Nation light bonfires by the CN rail line near Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory. CN freight trains are blocked, and Via Rail announces that its trains will be replaced by shuttle buses. In the afternoon, CN announces that it has obtained an injunction to clear blockage from its rail lines. * April 21 - Talks begin between the government of Canada, the government of Ontario, the Six Nations Elected Council, and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council, seeking to resolve the dispute. This is the first time since the establishment of the elected council in 1924 that the federal government has negotiated with the Confederacy Chiefs. * April 22 - The parties sign an agreement to continue talking, with a view of settling the land claim. They agree to each appoint a representative within two weeks. Blockade of Highway 6 over the Grand River by Six Nations protestors * April 24 - About 3000 Caledonia residents hold a rally demanding an end to the occupation. Later in the evening, several hundred residents confront OPP and Six Nations occupiers at the blockade. * April 25 - Haldimand County Mayor Marie Trainer says in an interview with CBC Newsworld that the residents of the town are being hurt economically by the protest and \\"don't have money coming in automatically every month\\". The protesters take this as an insult, believing it implies they all received provincial welfare. The Mayor said she does not intend that. The municipal council quickly distances itself from her comments, voting to replace her with deputy mayor Bob Patterson as their spokesperson on the issue. * April 28 - Caledonia residents once again gather to demand an end to the blockade. * April 30 - The provincial government appoints former premier David Peterson to help negotiate a settlement in the conflict. = May = Blockade of Highway 6 and 7th Line by Six Nations protestors * May 16 - Protesters open one lane of Argyle St. after an accident closed McKenzie Rd., the main detour route into Caledonia from points south of Town. After the accident is cleared, protesters close Argyle St. again, though they agree to let emergency vehicles through. * May 19 - In a letter to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council of Chiefs, the Government of Ontario announces that there will be an indefinite moratorium on construction on the Douglas Creek Estates site. * May 19 - Several Caledonia residents establish a counter-blockade on Argyle St., to prevent the protesters from accessing the site. * May 22 - Early in the morning, native protesters removed their blockade on Argyle St. Traffic remained blocked by the Caledonia residents' counter-blockade. * May 22 - Around 2:00 PM, protesters re-establish a barricade across Argyle St., using an electrical transmission tower and two backhoes, which dig a trench across the road. The two sides face each other separated by dozens of OPP officers. Scuffles including fistfights and verbal assaults continued to break out throughout the day, resulting in injuries to natives, residents and police. * May 22 - A truck crashes through the gates of a hydro substation, setting it on fire and damaging two transformers. This causes a blackout throughout Haldimand and parts of Norfolk counties, as well as over $1 million in damages.\\"Caledonia has hydro, backup repairs in works; State of emergency could be lifted Monday,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 27 May 2006 * May 22 - Six Nations Confederacy Chief Allen McNaughton (Tekarihoken) says, \\"As the world has seen, our protest has been firm but peaceful. Our people are responding without weapons, using only their bodies to assert that we are a sovereign people with a long history and that we cannot be intimidated.\\" * May 22 - A state of emergency is declared late in the evening due to the escalation of violence and the power-outage. * May 22 - In Saskatchewan, Cree protesters blockade the Yellowhead Highway near North Battleford in solidarity with the Six Nations protesters in Caledonia. Following negotiations with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the roadblock is removed after about two hours. * May 23 - At 1:30 PM, protesters offer to remove the barricade across Argyle St. as long as the counter-barricade is removed as well. By 3:20 PM the road is fully open to traffic. * May 24 - Power is restored to Caledonia during the morning hours. * May 27 - Power is restored to all areas affected by the blackout. = June = * June 5 - Six Nations protesters and Caledonia residents clash on the town's main street after a police cruiser drives through an area protesters consider \\"restricted\\" the night before. * June 9: Two elderly Simcoe residents are followed and surrounded in their car in a parking lot away from the occupation site. Native protesters jump onto the vehicle and threaten to kill them. According to residents, the police do not intervene. Following the altercation in the parking lot, more than 300 Caledonia residents gather at the Canadian Tire lot. Moving to a place near the construction site, some clash with OPP officers in full riot gear. * June 9 - Two CH News camera operators are surrounded by Six Nations protesters and assaulted when they refuse to hand over video tape containing footage of an altercation between natives and two non-natives in a parking lot adjacent to the Douglas Creek site. One reporter is later hospitalized with a head injury. Caledonia residents and the cameramen say the OPP did not assist the men. However, the Hamilton Spectator reports that Lynda Powless, publisher of the Turtle Island News, has produced photos which show OPP officers intervening. * June 9 - A U.S. Border Patrol vehicle, with agents reportedly observing the OPP's management of the crisis, is swarmed by Six Nations protesters. Two occupants are immediately forced out of the vehicle and a protester climbs in. A third OPP officer is injured as he tries to escape out the back door. The car is driven directly at him and he is narrowly pulled to safety by onlookers. Protesters seize sensitive OPP documents from the vehicle, which include identities of undercover officers and reports from confidential informants. The documents are later returned, but not before being photocopied and distributed to the media. The Ontario government has asked Six Nations that all photocopies be turned in. The vehicle is later returned. * June 9 - Arrest warrants are issued on charges related to this incident for Albert Douglas, 30; Skyler Williams, 22; Arnold Douglas, 61; and Ken Hill, 47, all of Ohsweken; Audra Ann Taillefer, 45, of Victoria, B.C., and Trevor Miller, 30.

Dubbed the \\"March for Freedom\\", the rally is blocked from the main entrance to the Douglas Creek Estates by the OPP. Instead, the rally goes to the grounds of the school that borders the site. McHale encourages the rally members to control their tempers. Meanwhile, some Six Nations people and their Native and non-Native supporters gather together for a \\"Potluck for Peace\\" on the contested site. = December = * December 16 - OPP arrest Gary McHale for breach of the peace for organizing a rally in Caledonia. = Further developments = On January 27, 2007, a report from the Department of Justice to the Six Nations Confederacy stated that their land claims would not hold up in court. On April 12, 2007, Haldimand County Mayor Marie Trainer said she received an e-mail from OPP commissioner Julian Fantino implying that the town was encouraging \\"divisive rallies\\" at the occupation site. He added that if any officers are harmed, he would not support a renewal of the town's policing contract in 2008 and would back any lawsuit brought against the town by individual officers. An OPP spokesperson told The Hamilton Spectator that the OPP would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the e-mail because it was meant to be private correspondence. On February 22, 2010, Marie Trainer said that the province was leaning towards giving the Douglas Creek Estates to the Six Nations Band Council, but that she expected it to be some time before a formal decision would be reached. In June 2014, the Haldimand County council ordered the removal of a native-made blockade in Caledonia. In November 2014, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council completed construction of a fence and gate surrounding the Douglas Creek Estates site in order to prevent trespassing on the disputed land. The only house at Douglas Creek Estates that had survived the violent confrontations in 2006 nearly burned to the ground overnight on the morning of November 15, 2016. =Allegations of police inaction= Throughout the occupation and protests, many Caledonia residents complained that they had been subject to threats and violence from Native protesters and that the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) failed to take any action to protect them. David Brown, who lived with his wife near the disputed area at the time, testified in court in November 2009 that he was required to carry a native-issued passport and needed approval from the protesters to enter his own house. He also claimed that after arriving \\"after curfew\\" one day, he was denied entry and jailed by the OPP when he caused trouble by ignoring the natives. Brown alleged that Native protesters threatened and harassed him repeatedly, and that rocks and mud were thrown at his family and their home. Brown and his wife sought $7 million in a civil lawsuit against the OPP on the basis that the police did nothing to protect him and his family during the occupation. In response to Brown's claims, Crown lawyer David Felicient stated that the situation \\"must be understood against the backdrop of the unique character of Aboriginal occupations and protests\\" and that the OPP were prevented from taking action due to \\"policy implications.\\" Felicient also suggested that Brown had fabricated portions of his testimony to draw attention to his lawsuit. When Felicient asked why Brown kept a loaded shotgun, Brown responded that \\"We were doing what we had to do to stay alive. I had no protection from our government. I felt that I needed to protect my wife and my family.\\" In court testimony, OPP Inspector Brian Haggith stated that the Native protesters \\"set up a checkpoint... Almost like they were entering another country,\\" and that community lost confidence in the OPP's ability to protect them. Haggith also testified that when natives set fire to a wooden bridge in town, the fire department withdrew from fighting the blaze when threatened by protesters. The fire chief told the OPP he did not believe they would protect him or his men. In addition, an electrical substation was destroyed, causing more than $1 million in damage and a blackout, when a truck crashed through its gates and was left ablaze. Haggith said that there was little response from the police. Inspector Haggith also testified that he hadasked for a change in policy at a subsequent meeting he had with his OPP superiors, but that his request was denied. On June 15, 2009 some Caledonia residents announced the formation of an unarmed \\"militia\\" to enforce laws they felt the Ontario Provincial Police had failed to uphold. Six Nations Councillor Claudine VanEvery-Albert, along with OPP spokesperson Constable Paula Wright both spoke out against the formation of a militia, and three days later, Ontario Community Safety Minister Rick Bartolucci called it a \\"dumb idea.\\" On July 8, 2011, Ontario Attorney General Chris Bentley announced a settlement of $20 million ending a class-action lawsuit which had been filed by 440 residents, 400 businesses and a handful of sub-contractors, which claimed negligence and malfeasance on the part of the provincial government and the OPP for failing to properly protect citizens who lived near Douglas Creek Estates. Some residents continued independent lawsuits. In 2018, a lawyer who oversaw the class-action lawsuit by Caledonia residents was charged with fraud. = Assault on Sam Gualtieri = On September 13, 2007, builder Sam Gualtieri was attacked and seriously injured in a confrontation with native protesters at the 90-home Stirling South subdivision development in Caledonia. Following a brief occupation two weeks prior, a small group of natives had occupied the property that morning, and the confrontation was going to end peacefully in the afternoon before Gualtieri arrived and clashed with the young protesters. On December 2, 2011, Richard Smoke (Mohawk) was convicted of assault for the attack on Gualtieri, which was described in court as \\"just a notch below culpable homicide\\". Gualtieri had asked Smoke and several other intruders to leave his daughter's house, which he was helping build as a wedding present. They attacked him. Smoke apologized to Gualtieri in court, in one of several criminal cases arising out of the DCE occupation.  September 2007 Brantford development protest  On September 4, 2007, a development site within six miles of the Grand River in Brantford was blocked off by native protesters, following an earlier visit where the protesters expressed concerns about the construction taking place on the disputed Haldimand Tract. Later in the day, police arrived on the scene and eventually some work was allowed to continue on the site.  Solidarity Protests  = Tyendinaga Gravel Quarry Occupation solidarity blockade = On April 25, 2008, Six Nations protesters blocked off the Highway 6 bypass and the CN Rail line to show support for four Mohawks arrested during a protest at Tyendinaga the day before; this protest was centred around a quarry on the disputed Culbertson Tract that had started in March 2007. Shawn Brant, one of the Tyendinaga protesters arrested, was charged with assault with a weapon, breach of bail conditions, possession of weapons and possession of marijuana. At around 4:30 PM, protesters in Caledonia dug a trench across the Highway 6 bypass and dragged a large part of a hydro tower over the road. The OPP erected two blockades on either side of the bypass to ensure public safety. = Wet ºsuwet ºen solidarity blockade = In response to the OPP moving in to arrest protesters at the level crossing located near Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory on the morning of February 24, 2020, and in solidarity with the Wet ºsuwet ºen opposing the construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline, members of the Mohawk Nation (Bear Clan) from Six Nations began a peaceful demonstration on the Ontario Highway 6 bypass near Caledonia, blocking traffic and commuter trains along the Lakeshore West GO line later in the day on February 24. Eventually, a blockade consisting of pallets and parked vehicles was set up on the highway, forcing traffic to be rerouted to a nearby bridge, and leading the OPP to place concrete barriers around the blockade for safety. The blockade remained up until March 19, when the protesters agreed to leave the road and withdraw to Douglas Creek Estates \\"as a sign of good faith\\".  McKenzie Meadows (1492 Land Back Lane)  = Background = McKenzie Meadows is a planned residential development project located south of Caledonia, on the west side of McKenzie Road and the south side of Fuller Drive. The project is owned by 2036356 Ontario Inc., with Michael Corrado listed as one of the owners and Losani Homes listed as one of the developers. The land involved in the development amounts to . In October and November 2013, the Six Nations Elected Council, through the community engagement website Six Nations Future, engaged in consultation with Six Nations citizens regarding the development. Benefits presented to the community during the consultation process include job prospects for community members and the raising of funds throughout the construction of residential units for the eventual construction of \\"Kawenn:io/Gaweni:yo Private School\\", a language school to be built on the reserve. Ultimately, a majority of respondents to the engagement process opposed the project, and the Grand Council voted to not execute an agreement with the developer at a council meeting on December 17. On September 9, 2015, Foxgate Development acquired the land for the project from Haldimand County. In 2016 and 2019, the Elected Council of Six Nations of the Grand River received various \\"accommodations\\" for the development, as per an agreement signed with Ballantry Homes, a Toronto-based residential development company that co-owns Foxgate. The agreement outlined an accommodation for the construction, consisting of of land across from Little Buffalo along Townline Road (170 Concession 17 Road in Hagersville) being transferred to Six Nations in 2016, as well as a transfer of $352,000 to the SNEC for use in future purchases of land, transferred in 2019. In return for these accommodations, the Elected Council agreed to support the development in a variety of ways, namely: * \\"To publicly support the development as it proceeds, including expressions and statements of ongoing support and commitment to the development (as may reasonably be requested from the owner from time to time); * \\"To not interfere with or disrupt the development, whether by protest, blockade or any other manner of interference; and * \\"To use all reasonable efforts to work with the owner to support a cessation of any action conducted by any member of any First Nations that is intended or is reasonably likely to delay, frustrate or interfere with the development. If the owner must seek legal remedies to deal with such action or conduct, or respond to any legal action which may be brought by any third party, SNEC shall support the owner and shall provide confirmation of such support in such form as may \\"be reasonably requested or required by the owner, provided that SNEC is reimbursed by the owner for the legal expenses that SNEC incurs in connection with the provision of SNEC's support.\\" This agreement was signed by SNEC Chief Ava Hill on June 18, 2019, but was not signed by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council (HCCC), the organization representing the traditional governance structure of the Haudenosaunee, which precedes the SNEC, established in 1924, and governs alongside the elected council. = Land reclamation/occupation =  July-August  Development of the McKenzie Meadows project continued, but on the afternoon of July 19, 2020, Six Nations community member Skyler Williams, along with a group of about 20 others, walked onto the site at 1535 McKenzie Road in order to stop the development. Once they had managed to put a stop to the construction work, the group established an encampment, referred to as a \\"reclamation site\\", on the site of the development. The reclamation site was eventually dubbed 1492 Land Back Lane by the self-proclaimed \\"land defenders\\" (the number referring to 1492, the year Christopher Columbus made landfall in the Caribbean, a commonly accepted starting point for European colonization of the Americas). Lonny Bomberry, Director of Six Nations Land and Resources, has said that there is no traditional land claim associated with the occupied development, since it has been under third-party ownership for at least 150 years, and while the entirety of the Haldimand Tract is subject to a land claim, that claim is not against third-party developers. On July 31, 2020, the OPP helped a court sheriff read and deliver a court injunction issued the day before against the demonstrators. The occupation continued, and on August 5, 2020, the OPP moved in to enforce the injunction, arresting nine people in the process, including Skyler Williams. While most media reported that the police fired \\"a single round from a weapon that shoots rubber bullets\\", several members of the occupation reported that at least three rubber bullets were fired during the violent enforcement of the injunction, which also involved land defenders throwing rocks at OPP. In response to this, Six Nations community members established a blockade on Argyle Street, the Highway 6 bypass, and the rail line. Tires and wood pellets were set on fire, and while police officers were setting up checkpoints, they were swarmed by protesters and prevented. The vice-president of Losani Homes indicated that the enforcement of the injunction would allow construction to continue. However, the following day, demonstrators returned to the camp, with community members and supporters showing up intermittently to provide support to those occupying the land. When asked about the events at 1492 Land Back Lane, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during his COVID-19 briefing on August 6, On August 7, a second court injunction was obtained by Haldimand County that \\"prevents anyone from blockading or restricting use of public roads in the municipality\\". That same day, the people at the occupation site requested meetings with federal officials, with only Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller agreeing to sit down and talk, according to a person at the occupation site as of August 10. On August 15, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council released a statement in support of the land defenders, stating that the McKenzie Meadows development was \\"proceeding in [their] 'red zone' which clearly sets out there will be a development moratorium within his [sic] area\\". In the statement, they called on the governments of Canada and Ontario to sit down at the negotiation table and address land issues with them, the hereditary chiefs, citing the issues left unresolved after the breakdown of talks following the dispute at Kanonhstaton. In a letter dated August 19, Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller and Minister of Crown‚ÄìIndigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett offered to resume negotiation of \\"longstanding and unresolved land issues\\" with elected chief Mark Hill and the Confederacy chiefs, referring to the negotiations that had been suspended pending litigation first in 1995 and then again in 2009. The last blockade near the site was removed on August 22. Someone was arrested in connection to the camp on August 24 in Hamilton, Ontario. On August 25, the Superior Court extended both the August 7 (despite the final blockade having come down three days prior) and July 30 injunctions, the latter of which \\"restrains anyone from occupying or hindering development of the construction site\\" and names Skyler Williams as a defendant. That day, the OPP reported that they would not be enforcing the injunction again until their liaison team \\"[had] had a chance to deescalate the situation,\\" but that they would have to move in should that fail.  September  Co-host of the podcast One Dish, One Mic Karl Dockstader (a member of Oneida Nation of the Thames, Bear Clan) and Mohawk Ryerson University research fellow Courtney Skye (a member of Six Nations of the Grand River, Turtle Clan) were arrested on September 2 and 3, respectively, along with three other arrests on September 2. Dockstader had been covering the occupation as an independent journalist, while Skye was reportedly \\"sitting on the banks of the Grand River with [her] auntie/sis.\\" Dockstader and Skye were both charged with disobeying a court order and mischief. No further information on the reason for his arrest was given to Dockstader at the time. Dockstader's release barred him from the site and from contacting employees of Foxgate under threat of further charges, conditions for which the OPP faced criticism for limiting media access to the campsite, and going against the decision made in the case of Justin Brake in 2019, where the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador set a precedent to distinguish activists and reporters. By the end of the day on September 3, OPP Constable Rodney LeClair estimated that there had been 17 arrests made so far, up from 13 reported earlier that morning. Two more arrests were made over the September 5-6 weekend, with the same charges as Skye and Dockstader. On Tuesday, September 15, Starla Myers, a member of Six Nations and reporter for Real Peoples Media, was arrested and charged with two counts of mischief and one count of disobeying a court order. The OPP continued to face criticism for arresting another reporter, but Constable LeClair re-iterated that the OPP are \\"committed to the freedom of the press and respects the important role the media has in the community. We value and strive to have collaborative relationships with our media partners.\\" The following day, Lela George (a member of the Oneida First Nation) became the 23rd person to be charged in relation to the occupation. In a letter dated September 17, Foxgate's legal counsel urged ministers to not enter into negotiations with the \\"occupiers\\" while they continued to defy the court injunction Foxgate held against them. On September 23, Haldimand County's police services board called on the OPP to step up enforcement of the injunction, claiming their current framework for responding to \\"Indigenous critical incidents\\" was not working, and characterizing the occupation as \\"acts of terrorism\\" in reference to the Canada Criminal Code. On September 29, the land defenders' spokesperson Skyler Williams received a phone call from the OPP informing him that there was a warrant for his arrest, for disobeying the existing injunction, continuing to occupy the site, mischief, and breaching conditions from his arrest on August 5.  October  According to the affidavit filed on October 5 by OPP West Region Regional Commander John Cain, police intelligence believed that a second raid on the occupation site would result in a very violent confrontation that wouldn't resolve the \\"underlying land dispute.\\" According to the affidavit, the OPP was concerned with the violent enforcement of the injunction, and had been actively trying to seek peaceful resolutions instead. The affidavit was filed in advance of a hearing on the injunctions in the Ontario Superior Court scheduled for October 9. As of October 9, 29 people had been charged in connection to the occupation and solidarity actions. In the October 9 injunction hearing at the Ontario Superior Court in Cayuga, Ontario, Justice John Harper again extended the injunctions and ordered those occupying the site to vacate it immediately. In his oral judgment, Harper said, The next injunction hearing is scheduled for October 22, 2020. = Solidarity action = In early August, it was reported that some Wet ºsuwet ºen had set up a rail blockade on their territory in northern British Columbia in solidarity with the demonstrators at the encampment, mirroring the blockades in solidarity with the Wet ºsuwet ºen earlier in 2020. On August 21, a local preacher organised a solidarity protest at the Rainbow Circle overpass south of Gravenhurst, Ontario. As of Monday, September 7, a GoFundMe legal fund in support of people facing criminal charges in connection to the camp had raised nearly $84,000 from over 1,100 donors. On October 9, in response to a call out across Turtle Island (North America) from the protesters at 1492 Land Back Lane, a day of action was held. Protests in solidarity with the land defenders (as well as with the MiÍûåkmaw fishers in their fight for fishing rights in Nova Scotia) were seen across the country. One solidarity blockade on Gitxsan and Wet ºsuwet ºen territory stopped traffic on British Columbia Highway 16 for several hours, in a demonstration meant to reinforce the continent-wide solidarity that had been seen earlier in the year as the Wet ºsuwet ºen opposed the construction of a pipeline on their territory. Another protest in Muskoka saw the third banner-drop in solidarity with Indigenous protesters this year, with banners reading \\"Muskoka Supports Six Nations Land Defenders,\\" \\"No More Land Theft!\\" and \\"We Are All Treaty People.\\" See also *Iroquois *Six Nations 40, Ontario * Indian Register * Indian Act * Oka Crisis * Ipperwash Crisis * Burnt Church Crisis * Gustafsen Lake Standoff * 2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests Notes References * Blatchford, Christie, Helpless: Caledonia's Nightmare of Fear and Anarchy, and How the Law Failed All of Us, 2010, * Graymont, Barbara, The Iroquois in the American Revolution, 1972, * Taylor, Alan, The Divided Ground, 2006, External links * CBC timeline of the 2006 dispute * Wikimapia placemark showing location of Douglas Creek Estates * Six Nations Future page on McKenzie Meadows Development Category:2006 in Ontario Category:2020 in Ontario Category:First Nations history in Ontario Category:Haldimand County Category:Indigenous conflicts in Canada Category:Protests in Canada Category:Aboriginal title in Canada ","title":"Grand River land dispute"},{"id":"4834608","text":"\\"Everyone's in Love with You\\" is a song written by Mike Love for the American rock band The Beach Boys.

The phrase was coined by Marcia Lynn Whicker in 1996 and is linked with a number of dysfunctional leadership styles. Their leadership style is both self-destructive and ultimately corporately harmful as they subvert and destroy organizational structures. In his book, Petty Tyranny in Organizations, Blake Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of leadership and identified what he referred to as petty tyrants, i.e.leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.Petty Tyranny in Organizations, Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)  Basic traits  The basic traits of a toxic leader are generally considered to be either/or insular, intemperate, glib, operationally rigid, callous, inept, discriminatory, corrupt or aggressive by scholars such as Barbara Kellerman. They boast that they are supposedly clever, always criticize other staff members and avoid or dislike to be asked awkward questions about their leadership style. These may occur as either: * Oppositional behaviour. * Plays corporate power politics. * An overcompetitive attitude to other employees. * Perfectionistic attitudes. * Abuse of the disciplinary system (such as to remove a workplace rival). * A condescending/glib attitude. * They are shallow and lack self-confidence. Toxic leaders are not confident with themselves and become aggressive to cope. * Poor self-control and/or restraint. * Physical and/or psychological bullying. * Procedural inflexibility. * Discriminatory attitudes (sexism, etc.). * Causes workplace division instead of harmony. * Use \\"divide and rule\\" tactics on their employees. * Arrogant * Irritability = Aggressive narcissism = This syndrome is also the 'Factor 1' in Robert D.Hare's Psychopathy Checklist, which includes the following traits: * Glibness/superficial charm * Grandiose sense of self-worth * Pathological lying * Cunning/manipulative * Lack of remorse or guilt * Callous/lack of empathy * Shallow emotional affect (genuine emotion is short-lived and egocentric) * Failure to accept responsibility for own actions = Other traits = Among toxic leaders, many are autocratic and/or control freaks to varying degrees, who tend to use both micromanagement, over management and management by fear to keep a grip of their authority in the organizational group. Micromanagers usually dislike a subordinate making decisions without consulting them, regardless of the level of authority or factual correctness. A toxic leader can be both hypocritical and hypercritical of others, seeking the illusion of corporate and moral virtue to hide their own workplace vices. Hypocrisy involves the deception of others and is thus a form of lying. They are sometimes maladjusted, and afraid of change. They can also be both frightening and psychologically stressful to work with. The Russian Army defines toxic leaders as commanders who put their own needs first, micro- manage subordinates, behave in a mean-spirited manner or display poor decision-making.\\"\\"Army worries about ‚Äòtoxic leaders‚Äô in ranks,\\" The Washington Post National. June 25, 2011. Retrieved 2011-09-13. A study for the Center for Army Leadership found that toxic leaders in the army work to promote themselves at the expense of their subordinates, and usually do so without considering long-term ramifications to their subordinates, their unit, and the Army profession.\\"Why do we allow Toxic Leadership to occur? \\" Combined Arms Center Blog. September 2, 2011. Retrieved 2011-09-13.  Tools  * Workload: The setting up to fail procedure is in particular a well established workplace bullying tactic that a toxic leader can use against his rivals and subordinates.Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)Rayner C, Hoel H A Summary Review of Literature Relating to Workplace Bullying Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 181‚Äì191, June 1997Randle J Workplace Bullying in the NHS (2006) * Corporate control systems: They could use the processes in place to monitor what is going on. Disciplinary systems could be abused to aid their power culture. * Organizational structures: They could abuse the hierarchies, personal relationships and the way that work flows through the business. * Corporate power structures: The toxic leader controls who, if any one makes the decisions and how widely spread power is. * Symbols of personal authority : These may include the right to parking spaces and executive washrooms or access to supplies and uniforms. Narcissistic symbols and self-images (i.e. workplace full of self-portraits). * Workplace rituals and routines: Management meetings, board reports, disciplinary hearing, performance assays and so on may become more habitual than necessary. Inevitably the victim's workplace performance, self-esteem and self-confidence will decline as employee(s)' stress inclines. Heavy running costs and a high staff turnover/overtime rate are often also associated with employee related results of a toxic leader.  Key theorists  = Jean Lipman-Blumen = Jean Lipman-Blumen's book, The Allure of Toxic Leaders : Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt Politicians‚Äîand How We Can Survive Them, Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen explained that there was and still is a tendency among contemporary society to seek authoritative, even dominating characteristics among our corporate and political leaders because of the public's own personal psychosocial needs and emotional weaknesses. Dr. Lipman-Blumen noticed \\"toxic leadership\\" was not about run-of-the-mill mismanagement. Rather, it referred to leaders, who, by virtue of their \\"dysfunctional personal characteristics\\" and \\"destructive behaviours\\" \\"inflict reasonably serious and enduring harm\\" not only on their own followers and organizations, but on others outside of their immediate circle of victims and subordinates, as well. A noted rule of thumb suggests that toxic leaders leave their followers and others who come within their sphere of influence worse off than they found them either on a personal and/or corporate basis. Dr. Lipman-Blumens' core focus was on investigating why people will continue to follow and remain loyal to toxic leaders. She also explored why followers often vigorously resist change and challenges to leaders who have clearly violated the leader/follower relationship and abused their power as leaders to the direct detriment of the people they are leading. Lipman-Blumen suggests there is something of a deeply psychological nature going on. She argues the need to feel safe, specialness and in a social community all help explain this psychological phenomenon. = Barbara Kellerman = In Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters, Barbara Kellerman (2004) suggests that toxicity in leadership (or simply, \\"bad leadership\\") may be analysed into seven different types: * Incompetent ‚Äì the leader and at least some followers lack the will or skill (or both) to sustain effective action. With regard to at least one important leadership challenge, they do not create positive change. * Rigid ‚Äì the leader and at least some followers are stiff and unyielding. Although they may be competent, they are unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new information, or changing times. * Intemperate ‚Äì the leader lacks self-control and is aided and abetted by followers who are unwilling or unable to effectively intervene. * Callous ‚Äì the leader and at least some followers are uncaring or unkind. Ignored and discounted are the needs, wants, and wishes of most members of the group or organization, especially subordinates. * Corrupt ‚Äì the leader and at least some followers lie, cheat, or steal. To a degree that exceeds the norm, they put self-interest ahead of the public interest. * Insular ‚Äì the leader and at least some followers minimize or disregard the health and welfare of those outside the group or organization for which they are directly responsible. * Evil ‚Äì the leader and at least some followers commit atrocities. They use pain as an instrument of power. The harm can be physical, psychological or both. = Terry Price = In his book, Understanding Ethical Failures in Leaders', Terry L. Price argues that the volitional account of moral failures in leaders do not provide a complete account of this phenomenon. Some have suggested that the reason leaders misbehave ethically is because they willingly go against what they know to be wrong. Professor Price however, offers an alternative analysis of leaders who excuse themselves from normally applicable moral requirements. He argues that a cognitive account for ethical failures in leaders provides a better analysis of the issues involved in all the ethical conundrums under the rubric of \\"toxic leadership\\". Leaders can know that a certain kind of behavior is generally required by morality but still be mistaken as to whether the relevant moral requirement applies to them in a particular situation and whether others are protected by this requirement. Price demonstrates how leaders make exceptions of themselves, explains how the justificatory force of leadership gives rise to such exception-making, and develops normative protocols that leaders should adopt.

In 1956, with the death of boss Jack Dragna, Bompensiero was demoted to the rank of soldier by the new boss, Frank DeSimone. He was the older brother of associate Salvatore \\"Sam\\" Bompensiero. Bompensiero made a name for himself for the many killings he committed on the orders of his superiors. Jimmy Fratianno, a close associate, once said that Bompensiero \\"had buried more bones than could be found in the brontosaurus room of the Museum of Natural History.\\"\\"Frank Bompensiero: San Diego Hit Man, Boss and FBI Informant\\" Crime Magazine by Allen May Early life and family Bompensiero's family was from Porticello, Sicily. His family immigrated to the United States in 1904 along with the Balistrieri family (Frank Balistrieri would eventually lead the Milwaukee crime family). After the family settled in Milwaukee Bompensiero was born on October 29, 1905. As a child, he attended Andrew Jackson Elementary School in Milwaukee but dropped out after the third grade. While in Milwaukee, he worked at an automobile parts manufacturer. He moved to San Diego as a young man in the mid-1920s. It was during his time in San Diego that he also worked in organized crime and bootlegging alcohol. He eventually married Thelma Jan San- Felippe and had one child, a daughter named Mary Ann. He also had a grandson named Frank. His first home in San Diego was at 5878 Estelle Street before moving to Pacific Beach neighborhood later on. During World War II Bompensiero also served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1943. Western rackets Early in Bompensiero's crime career in San Diego in the 1920s, he met Jack Dragna in Los Angeles, who was the boss of the Los Angeles crime family. After seeing how fearless Bompensiero was, Dragna soon became his mentor. Bompensiero was then involved in bootlegging operations in San Diego during Prohibition. He was later convicted of a liquor violation in San Diego. His other early arrests were for possession of firearms, illegal gambling, kidnapping, and murder. Charges were dropped in most cases. He eventually served a year in McNeil Island Corrections Center for the liquor conviction and was released in 1933. Impressed with the young criminal, Dragna eventually made him a caporegime, placing him in charge of all of the L.A. family's interests in San Diego. Wanted for questioning in the Redondo Beach murder of mobster Les Brunemann, Frank Bompensiero left California, but was able to return in 1941 after an innocent man was convicted of Brunemann's murder. During the 1940s and 1950s, Bompensiero owned a San Diego music store with Gaspare Matranga and a horseracing wire service company. He also owned the Gold Rail cafe in downtown at the U.S. Grant Hotel, a successful business that he owned with Tom Dragna's son Frank and nephew Louis. Bompensiero and his crew also co-owned and operated several bars in the downtown San Diego area where they often conducted loan sharking operations. During this time Bompensiero was tabbed by Dragna as an extortion shakedown artist and hitman in San Diego and Los Angeles. He was involved in one of the attempts on Mickey Cohen's life at Cohen's business office on the Sunset Strip, and killed Cohen torpedo Neddie Herbert. Bomp's San Diego crew included Tony Mirabile, Paul Mirabile, Gaspare Matranga, Joe Adamo, Biaggio Bonventre, and Joseph Li Mandri. His close associates in the Los Angeles mob included Jimmy The Weasel Fratianno and Leo Lips Moceri, both of whom he teamed up with on multiple occasions to commit mob sanctioned murders. In 1955, Bompensiero was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in an illegal liquor license transaction and was sentenced to 3‚Äì42 years in prison. He began his sentence at Chino in Chino. While in prison, his wife Thelma died of a stroke. Bompensiero was escorted from prison by the police so he could attend her funeral. He was later transferred to San Quentin State Prison in Northern California, the same prison where Jimmy Fratianno was serving a prison sentence for extortion. While Bompensiero was in prison, Mob boss Jack Dragna died of a heart attack and attorney and mobster Frank DeSimone took over the Los Angeles crime family. DeSimone immediately demoted Bompensiero to soldier from caporegime, and appointed Tony Mirabile as the boss of San Diego. Outraged, Bompensiero later attempted to transfer to the Chicago Outfit, but was unsuccessful. Johnny Roselli later told Fratianno that he didn't want both Fratianno and Bompensiero to transfer to Chicago, because it would seem to Chicago like \\"everyone\\" who was a good worker wanted to leave the L.A. family. While on parole, Bompensiero worked several jobs for friends and associates to satisfy his parole work requirements. Soon Bompensiero had numerous new dealings in Las Vegas with Cleveland mobster and casino owner Moe Dalitz and Chicago Outfit mobster Anthony Spilotro. He also counted retired Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Bonanno in Arizona, and John Roselli as allies; later over a hit dispute, he had a falling out with Roselli. In 1967, Bompensiero was arrested with Fratianno over a Fratianno Trucking Company dirt hauling union scheme where Jimmy's company had violated PUC regulations. This legal violation involved Jimmy and Jewel Fratianno's large trucking company, Fratianno Trucking. Under intense pressure, with he and Fratianno in the El Centro jail, unable to make a high bail, Bompensiero agreed to become an undercover FBI informant, and the charges against him were eventually dropped. In the early 1970s, Bompensiero and Tony Spilotro started a large loan sharking operation in Las Vegas. In November 1975, acting as driver, Bompensiero helped Spilotro murder Tamara Rand, a multi millionaire real estate broker and investor from San Diego. At that time, Rand was suing Allen Glick, the mob front man in Las Vegas, to pay back a $2 million loan that she had made to him. Spilotro carefully snuck into Rand's house as she was ready to have tea, and fatally shot her with a .22 caliber handgun, equipped with a silencer, while Bompensiero drove the murder getaway car. FBI sting and murder Bompensiero (right) Jimmy Fratianno. Since the death of Los Angeles boss Jack Dragna, Bompensiero had been highly critical of the new family leadership. Boss Dominic Brooklier, who never trusted Bompensiero, finally lost patience and decided to have him killed. Bompensiero was an extremely cautious gangster and proved difficult to kill. To make Bompensiero less cautious, Brooklier promoted him from soldier to caporegime. Six months later, the Los Angeles family was still trying to get to Bompensiero. In 1977, the FBI set up a pornography sting business called \\"Forex\\" and used Bompensiero to convince the Los Angeles family to make an attempt to extort money from Forex. The sting operation worked, and Michael Rizzitello was given a subpoena by the FBI agents who ran Forex. After the Forex indictments in February 1977, Fratianno questioned Bompensiero about how he learned about Forex. Unsatisfied with Bompensiero's cagey responses, Fratianno became convinced that Bomp was an informant. A week later, on February 10, 1977, Frank Bompensiero was shot to death at close range with a silenced .22 caliber handgun while walking home after using a pay phone outside an Arco Station in the Pacific Beach neighborhood of San Diego. In 1978, Fratianno told law enforcement that mob associate Thomas Ricciardi had killed Bompensiero in return for membership in the Los Angeles family. When Ricciardi shot Bompensiero, Jack LoCicero was waiting in the getaway car. The government later charged Ricciardi with Bompensiero's murder, but he died of heart disease before the trial could start. The rest of the defendants were acquitted of murder at the trial, but were convicted of racketeering.

It starred Stacey Cadman, Stephen Marcus and Lucinda Rhodes-Flaherty. It followed the adventures of a teenage cavegirl. Although based in a Stone Age world, there are many references to modern pop culture and in a similar vein to The Flintstones there are many ancient versions of modern inventions featured. Its theme tune is a cover version of Go Wild in the Country, sung by Stacey Cadman. It was developed by Dan and Producer Andy Bell. Daniel Peacock's production company Two Hats Film and TV eventually produced.  Plot  The main characters are Cavegirl herself and her family Dad, Mum, Big Sis, Gran and Little Bro. Other tribe members feature prominently. Cavegirl is a pretty, feisty individual and a bit of a tomboy although during the series she begins to become interested in boys and many of the storylines involve her becoming more mature. Big Sis is very interested in her appearance and how boys see her. She is also rather shallow. Dad is the stereotypical rugged caveman, although he is protective of his children, and is the chief of the tribe. Mum is a little dozey and Gran is very young at heart and more than a little crazy. Little Brother is curious about the world and often annoys Cavegirl immensely. In season 2, Dad has left to look for new hunting grounds, and a new character, \\"Chief\\", has replaced him. In a flashback episode near the end of the season it was shown that Dad left Mum in charge, but she lost a bet with \\"The Chief of the Tribe to the North\\" and the tribes merged to form a larger one.

Written by Steve Carell, who also acts in the show as Michael Scott, and directed by Ken Kwapis, the episode originally aired in the United States on May 11, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Nancy Carell as Carol Stills and Melora Hardin as Jan Levinson. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the office hosts a casino night, to which Michael Scott (Carell) inadvertently invites two dates. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) decides to transfer to Dunder Mifflin's Stamford branch and reveals to Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) his feelings for her. The episode was the first of the series to run as a \\"supersized\\" episode, featuring twenty-eight minutes and twenty seconds of content rather than the standard twenty minutes and thirty seconds. In addition, the episode was the first of the series to be written by Carell; he had suggested the idea for the episode to executive producer Greg Daniels, who thoroughly enjoyed the idea and green lit the script. \\"Casino Night\\" also introduces the musical exploits of Kevin Malone, played by Brian Baumgartner. The episode received wide acclaim from television critics and earned a Nielsen rating of 3.9 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, being seen by 7.7 million viewers. It is generally considered by both critics and audiences to be one of the show's greatest episodes. Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) organizes a casino charity event in the warehouse, and unwittingly winds up with two dates for the evening, his boss Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and his real-estate agent Carol Stills (Nancy Carell). Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) go through audition tapes for her wedding band and discover that colleague Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) has his own band. Jim, upset about Pam's impending marriage to Roy Anderson (David Denman), tells the documentary crew that he met with Jan about transferring to the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin because he has \\"no future here.\\" During Casino Night, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) wins a game of craps and kisses Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) on the cheek, disregarding their attempts to keep their intimate relationship a secret. She slaps him and walks away, with the two quietly enjoying the experience. Jan and Carol share an awkward conversation when they realize Michael has invited them both. Jim tells Jan that he's made a decision about the transfer. After Roy leaves, Jim tells Pam that he is in love with her. After a stunned pause, she states she cannot be with him. He tells her he wants to be more than friends, but she claims he \\"misinterpreted things.\\" Heartbroken, Jim apologizes for misinterpreting their friendship and discreetly wipes a tear from his cheek as he walks away. Jan leaves Michael and Carol, noticeably upset from the night's events, and it is revealed she packed an overnight bag in her car, implying she had planned to spend the night with Michael. Pam returns to the office and talks to her mother over the phone about Jim's confession. Jim enters the room and approaches her as she hastily hangs up. She begins to say something but Jim kisses her, and after hesitating, she returns the kiss, ending with the two staring at each other in silence. Production Actor Steve Carell (pictured) wrote \\"Casino Night\\". \\"Casino Night\\" was the first episode of the series written by Steve Carell. Initially, Carell suggested to executive producer Greg Daniels that an episode should revolve around a casino night. When it came time to plan the finale for the show, Daniels chose the idea and picked Carell to write the script. Parts of the script were fleshed out during the flights to and from New York City when the show was filming the earlier episode \\"Valentine's Day\\". Later, Carell had only one weekend to write the bulk script. Daniels was very happy with the rough script and noted that Carell \\"came in with a great draft\\". Jenna Fischer admitted that filming the episode was a relief because she had \\"been carrying around the secret cliff-hangers for two months\\". Toby Flenderson, who is portrayed by writer Paul Lieberstein, stated during the episode \\"I'm gonna chase that feeling\\" after winning at a game of poker. The line was originally intended to lead to a subplot wherein Toby develops a gambling addiction, but the storyline was later abandoned.Daniels, Greg (Producer). 2006. \\"Casino Night\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal, retrieved May 12, 2008 The episode was the fifth episode of the season and the seventh of the entire series directed by Ken Kwapis. During the editing of the episode, executive producer Greg Daniels publicly addressed NBC in an interview, stating, \\"I'd like to get a supersized episode, because it‚Äôs a really long script with a lot of good stuff.\\"Ryan, Maureen (February 23, 2006). 'Office' promotions pay off in a big way , Chicago Tribune (Tribune Company). Retrieved May 12, 2008 In response, fans of the show set up an online petition to \\"supersize\\" the season finale. The website generated over 2,800 signatures. On April 20, NBC announced it would be extending the season finale by ten minutes. Although other NBC shows Will & Grace and My Name Is Earl that aired on the same night had extended episodes, cast members David Denman and John Krasinski credited in interviews the petition for the extended time. Denman and Krasinski both believed that the petition was partially responsible for the other two shows getting extended times as well. The filming of the episode's ending caused a \\"huge divide among the writing staff and the director and the cast\\". Carell, Kwapis, and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to \\"follow the characters and the emotion of the moment\\" by having the action captured in full by the show's cameramen. The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, \\"The writing staff was itching to do something kind of weird [with the scene] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn't know was going to happen and so only heard on their mics and came running around the corner to film.\\" The episode features Kevin Malone playing the drums in a band, which had been an idea circulated since the first season, when allusions to him being in a Steve Miller tribute band were written; the scenes had to be removed from the series due to issues negotiating with the singer. The crew later decided to have Kevin be in a Police tribute band called Scrantonicity because he \\"talks so low, and has very little expression, and there is no band that sings higher and with more expression than the Police.\\" While Kevin was always intended to be the band's lead singer, executive producer Greg Daniels approached Baumgartner about possibly playing an instrument, but the actor replied he could not play anything. Daniels and Baumgartner then discussed instruments that would be \\"funny\\" to play and brought up harmonicas, saxophones, and drums. They ultimately decided on drums because they deemed a \\"drumming lead singer [to] be the funniest choice,\\" regardless of the fact that the actor had \\"absolutely no drumming experience, and it's a difficult instrument.\\" The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael creating Dunder Mifflin Mad Libs, Dwight and Jim choosing their charities, Dwight considering Jim's telekinetic powers, an extension of Michael's scene with Darryl, Pam finding planning a wedding stressful, Meredith and the casino dealer sharing a past. Cultural references On the phone with Jan, Michael compares the performance of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin to the biblical story of David and Goliath. He later tells her that she's the \\"Eva Peron to his Cesar Chavez\\". He later answers a phone from her by saying \\"Jan Levinson, I presume\\", a reference to the quote \\"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume\\", supposedly said by Henry Morton Stanley to David Livingstone after the former met the latter on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in 1871. Michael reasons that the money from the casino night should benefit the Boy Scouts of America because \\"They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts!\\" He later states that he will donate all of his charity winnings to Comic Relief, a British charity. Kelly reasons that she would donate her winnings to Kobe Bryant's foundation, only because he bought his wife a large ring. When Michael mentions donating money to \\"Afghanistanis with AIDS\\", the conversation gets confused, and the various office workers being talking about Afghanis, Afghans, and the nonsensical \\"Afghanistanannis\\". In a talking head, Michael notes that AIDS is not a humorous disease, and is one of the many things that is off-topic in comedy, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy and The Holocaust. However, he notes that the assassination of Abraham Lincoln recently became funny. While looking through the various cover bands, Jim and Pam stumble upon a Kiss tribute and Jim tells Pam that her wedding should have three stages like Lollapalooza. Kevin's band is playing a cover of \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" by The Police. Reception =Ratings= \\"Casino Night\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 11, 2006. The episode received a 3.9 rating/10 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode was viewed by 7.7 million viewers, and retained 93 percent of its lead-in \\"My Name is Earl\\" audience. Alt URL For his work on this episode, Steve Carell was nominated for and won the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Comedy. =Reviews= \\"Casino Night\\" received widespread critical acclaim from television critics. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad stated that \\"This episode, the season finale, was, in a word, brilliant. You could not ask for a better way to tie up story lines that occurred over the course of a season while opening up new ones at the same time.\\" Sciannamea went on to praise Carell's writing, as well as the progression of the relationship arcs in the show. Brian Zoromski of IGN said that \\"'Casino Night,' was full of great character development, awkward situations and laugh-out-loud moments.\\" Zoromski enjoyed the unfolding of the Jim-Pam relationship during the latter half of season two, and the climax of it in the season finale. He also enjoyed and praised the development of two minor characters, Kevin Malone and Creed Bratton, the latter played by the actor of the same name. He ultimately awarded the episode a ten out of ten, denoting a \\"Masterpiece\\". Jacob Cliffton of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an \\"A\\". Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly noted that, unlike other shows that featured resolved sexual tension, The Office was in no worry of being cancelled. She based this deduction on the fact that the show \\"isn't based entirely on the endearing flirtation between\\" Jim and Pam. In a 2011 poll conducted by fansite OfficeTally, fans voted \\"Casino Night\\" as their favorite of all Office episodes that had been aired at that time.

One night he was in Manhattan when he looked toward the New Jersey Palisades Cliffs, on which the amusement park sat. That was when inspiration hit and the title was added. Years later the Palisades Amusement Park closed, on September 12, 1971. A tribute to New Jersey's Palisades Amusement Park, it is an up-tempo rock and roll tune led by a distinctive organ part. The track also incorporates amusement park sound effects, including the sounds of screaming riders on the roller coasters, and the quoting of a slower version of \\"Entrance of the Gladiators\\", played on an organ imitating a hurdy-gurdy or calliope. In the song, the singer takes a walk after dark and discovers Palisades Park, where he meets and falls in love with a girl.

He descended from a long line of rulers of the British Kingdom of Alt Clut. Either he or his father, Dyfnwal ap Rhydderch, King of Alt Clut, may have reigned when the Britons are recorded to have burned the Pictish ecclesiastical site of Dunblane in 849. In 870, the seat of Arthgal's realm‚Äîthe island fortress of Alt Clut‚Äîwas besieged by the Viking kings Amla√≠b and √çmar. After four months, the fortress fell to the Vikings, who are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of Arthgal's realm. Afterwards, the capital of the kingdom appears to have relocated up the River Clyde to the vicinity of Govan and Partick, and became known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Two years after the fall of Alt Clut, Arthgal is recorded to have been assassinated at the behest of Causant√≠n mac Cin√°eda, King of the Picts. The circumstances surrounding Arthgal's death are uncertain. Whilst it is possible he was captured by the Vikings in 870 and slain whilst still in captivity, it is also possible that he was reigning as king when he died. The fact that Arthgal's succeeding son, Rhun, was Causant√≠n's brother-in-law could be evidence that Arthgal was killed to make way for Rhun. Another possibility is that, following the destruction of Alt Clut, Arthgal ruled as a puppet king under the Vikings. If so, this could also account for Causant√≠n's actions. On the other hand, Causant√≠n may have merely acted out of sheer opportunism, and Rhun may have succeeded to the throne without his assistance. In any event, either Arthgal or Rhun could have been the first kings to rule as King of Strathclyde. Family Locations relating to Arthgal's life and times. According to a pedigree preserved within a collection of tenth-century Welsh genealogical material known as the Harleian genealogies, Arthgal descended from a long line of kings of Alt Clut.Guy (2016) pp. 22‚Äì23; Clarkson (2014) chs. genealogical tables, 1; Edmonds (2014) p. 201; Clarkson (2010) chs. genealogical tables, 2, 8; Bartrum (2009) p. 29; Clancy (2006c); Dumville (1999) p. 110; Macquarrie (1998) pp. 3‚Äì12; Woolf (1998) pp. 159‚Äì160; Williams; Smyth; Kirby (1991) p. 134; Macquarrie (1990) p. 7; Anderson, AO (1922) pp. clvii‚Äìclviii; Phillimore (1888) pp. 172‚Äì173; Skene (1867) p. 15.

In about 849, the ninth- to twelfth-century Chronicle of the Kings of Alba reports that Britons burned Dunblane, a Pictish ecclesiastical centre seated on the southern Pictish border.Evans (2015) p. 150; McNiven (2014) p. 53; Clarkson (2010) ch. 8 ¬∂ 19; Downham (2007) p. 162; Woolf (2007) pp. 93‚Äì95; Davidson (2002) p. 126, 128 n. 75; Macquarrie (1998) p. 12; Hudson, BT (1998) pp. 148, 153; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 288; Skene (1867) p. 8.

The razing of Dunblane could be evidence that the British Kingdom of Alt Clut was in the process of extending its authority at the expense of the Pictish regime. If so, the kings of Alt Clut would appear to have seized upon the chaos wrought by contemporaneous Viking attacks upon the Picts.Downham (2007) p. 162. King of Alt Clut The fortress of Alt Clut occupied Alt Clut (\\"the rock of the Clyde\\").Yorke (2009) p. 49.

On one hand, it is possible that Alt Clut was targeted because it was regarded as a rich target.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 171; Downham (2007) p. 142; Woolf (2007) p. 110. On the other hand, the remarkable duration of the siege could indicate that, instead of merely plundering Arthgal's realm, Amla√≠b and √çmar specifically sought and succeeded in capturing the capital.Clarkson (2014) ch. 3; McLeod, SH (2011) p. 171. It could be that Amla√≠b and √çmar regarded the kings of Alt Clut as an active threat to their maritime interests,Woolf (2007) p. 110; Macquarrie (1998) p. 18. and that the fortress of Alt Clut served the Britons much like how ' were utilised as naval bases by the Vikings in Ireland.Woolf (2007) p. 110. The destruction of the citadel may have allowed the Vikings to gain unrestricted access into central Scotland.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 88‚Äì89. On one hand, the recorded ethnicity of the Vikings' captives could reveal that the Britons of Alt Clut possessed many English and Pictish slaves or subjects.Hicks (2003) p. 34 n. 74. On the other hand, the recorded ethnicities may be evidence that Alt Clut's fall was the only recorded incident in what may have been a series of coeval Viking campaigns in the region,Downham (2018) p. 49; McLeod, S (2015) p. 11 n. 65; McLeod, SH (2011) p. 124; Hicks (2003) p. 34 n. 74; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 51. and may indicate that Amla√≠b and √çmar not only established overlordship over the Strathclyde British, but that they also asserted power over the English of Lothian and throughout the Pictish realm.McLeod, SH (2011) p. 171; √ì Corr√°in (2008) p. 430; √ì Corr√°in (2006) pp. 56‚Äì57; √ì Corr√°in (2001b) p. 21.

The fact that the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland seems to show that Amla√≠b promptly returned to Britain in about 872 could be evidence that the assault on Alt Clut was undertaken in the context of territorial conquest/control rather than the mere acquisition of portable wealth.Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2010) ¬ß 400; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland (2008) ¬ß 400; Downham (2007) pp. 142, 240; √ì Corr√°in (1998a) ¬ß¬ß 39‚Äì40; √ì Corr√°in (1998b) p. 332.

Conversely, if there was no strife between Rhun and Arthgal, Causant√≠n's actions against the latter could have been carried out in the context of an intrusive and aggressive neighbour.

The sarcophagus could to be that of Arthgal's adversary, Causant√≠n.Driscoll, ST (2014). Arthgal's elimination may have been carried out in the context of an attempt by Causant√≠n to capitalise upon the political turmoil wrought by the Viking onslaught.Downham (2007) p. 163; Broun (2004a); Hudson, BT (1994) p. 52.

This relocation of the capital seems to be borne out by surviving documentary sources. Until the fall of Alt Clut, for example, the rulers of the realm were styled after the fortress. After the loss of this site, the Kingdom of Alt Clut came to be known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde in consequence of its reorientation towards Ystrat Clut (Strathclyde), the valley of the River Clyde.Driscoll, ST (2015) p. 5; Clarkson (2014) ch. 3 ¬∂ 11; Edmonds (2014) pp. 200‚Äì201; Clarkson (2012a) ch. 8 ¬∂ 23; Clarkson (2012b) ch. 11 ¬∂ 46; Clarkson (2010) ch. 8 ¬∂ 26; Davies (2009) p. 73; Downham (2007) p. 162 n. 158; Clancy (2006c); Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

In fact, it is possible that he or Rhun was the first monarch to rule this realm.Clarkson (2014) chs. 1 ¬∂ 23, 3 ¬∂ 18. There is also reason to suspect that Arthgal's death occurred in the context of conflict with the Picts.Clarkson (2014) ch. 3 ¬∂ 21, 3 n. 21; Davidson (2002) p. 126; Hudson, BT (2002) p. 41; Hudson, BT (1998) p. 154 n. 23; Hudson, BT (1996) pp. 203‚Äì204; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 52; . For example, the twelfth-century Prophecy of Berch√°n attributes four victories to Causant√≠n, with the fourth described as that of '‚Äîa location possibly identical to Glasgow‚Äîwhere he overcame the \\"king of the Britons of the green mantles\\". This source, coupled with Arthgal's obituaries, could indicate that Causant√≠n had Arthgal executed or assassinated after defeating him in battle.Clarkson (2014) ch. 3 ¬∂ 21, 3 n. 21; Hudson, BT (2002) p. 41; Durkan (1998) p. 129; Hudson, BT (1998) p. 154 n. 23; Hudson, BT (1996) pp. 43 ¬ß 128, 84‚Äì85 ¬ß 128, 203‚Äì204; Hudson, BT (1994) p. 52; Anderson, AO (1930) p. 39 ¬ß 126; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 335; Skene (1867) p. 85. Such an event may account for the specific records of Causant√≠n's role in Arthgal's demise.Hudson, BT (2002) p. 41; Hudson, BT (1996) pp. 203‚Äì204. Another possibility is that, following the conquest of Alt Clut, Arthgal ruled as a puppet king under Amla√≠b and √çmar. Certainly, the Vikings utilised royal puppets in the conquered English kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia. A similar relationship between Arthgal and Viking power could explain Causant√≠n's role in Arthgal's demise, and could explain how Rhun succeeded to the throne. There is also reason to suspect that, as a result of Rhun's assumption of power, Causant√≠n gained overlordship over the kingdom.Walker (2013) ch. 1 ¬∂ 42. In any event, Arthgal's apparent elimination at Causant√≠n's instigation would appear to have rid the Picts of a neighbouring adversary, and would have served to increase Causant√≠n's authority and reputation.Clarkson (2012b) ch. 11 ¬∂ 46.

It usually reduces the tendency to relapse of tooth rotations corrected by dental braces or other treatments. The most frequently encountered post-orthodontic problem is the retention of re- established tooth position. Relapse (drifting of the tooth back to its position prior to orthodontic correction) may occur anywhere, but it is often associated with teeth that have undergone rotation (twisting) as part of the orthodontic therapy. A fiberotomy involves the detachment of the fibers that attach the tooth to the bone via the gum. The fibers act much like twisted rubber bands and releasing the tension between the fibers and the tooth reduces the forces that attempt to pull the tooth back to its original position. It is performed near the completion of the orthodontics and is shown to be effective in preventing the relapse of teeth. To perform this procedure, there is the surgical cutting of disrupted transeptal fibres by making a gingival crevicular incision under local anesthetic after orthodontic alignment. This procedure is painless as long as the patient takes an analgesic after the numbing has worn off.

New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a New York state law preventing convicted felons from practicing medicine, even when the felony conviction occurred before the law was enacted. The case Dr. Hawker was convicted in 1878 of performing an illegal abortion. He served his time, and then resumed the practice of medicine. In 1893 and 1895, the legislature of the State of New York passed public health laws making it illegal for convicted felons to practice medicine. Dr. Hawker was convicted under this law in 1896, but contended that the law passed after his conviction was putting an additional penalty on him, contrary to the protection from ex post facto laws in Section 10 of Article One of the United States Constitution. Majority opinion Justice Brewer's opinion cites Dent v. West Virginia and other cases which held that states may add new qualifications for practicing medicine that apply to those already in practice. It also cites Jones v. Brim , which held that the states have a right to classify individuals for application of laws and also Alabama and California cases where the right to vote or to sell liquor (respectively) could be revoked on the basis of a prior conviction when that conviction is reasonable evidence that a person has broken a law, and thus is evidence of insufficient good character to exercise the right. An exigent threat to patient safety was provided as the reason to revoke Dr. Hawker's medical license. However, it is worthy of note that he was not an existential threat when legally practicing. However, when the law changed, the safety of the public suddenly became of paramount concern and he was disbarred. \\"It is, no one can doubt, of high importance to the community that health, limb and life should not be left to the treatment of ignorant pretenders and charlatans. It is within the power of the legislature to enact such laws as will protect the people from ignorant pretenders, and secure them the services of reputable, skilled and learned men... To require this is an exercise of the police power for the protection of the public against incompetents and impostors, and is in no sense the creation of a monopoly or special privileges. The door stands open to all who possess the requisite age and good character, and can stand the examination which is exacted of all applicants alike.\\" Dissenting opinion Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion contends that this is a case of an ex post facto law, given that the law does not consider the doctor's current fitness for the job, but rather relies on a conviction nearly 20 years old, which he does not consider evidence of current character.

It analyzes sources, including the New Testament and non-canonical works. The latter include the agrapha, the apocryphal gospels (such as the Gospel of Thomas), Josephus, and other Jewish and second-century Roman works. For deciding what comes from Jesus as distinct from early Christian tradition it proposes these primary criteria (pp. 168‚Äì77): :1. The criterion of embarrassment: Why invent what would invite difficulty for the early church? :2. The criterion of discontinuity: Why reject as words or deeds of Jesus what cannot be derived from the Judaism of Jesus' time or the early church? :3. The criterion of multiple attestation: Is it more plausible to deny words, sayings, or deeds attributed to Jesus in more than one independent literary source (e.g., Mark, Q, Paul, and John) or literary genre (e.g., parable, miracle story, or prophecy)? :4. The criterion of coherence: Given the claims to historicity from any of the above criteria, are different sayings or deeds evidently inconsistent? :5. The criterion of rejection and execution: If Jesus' ministry came to a violent, public end, what of Jesus' words or deeds could have alienated people, especially powerful people? The criteria are to be used in concert for mutual correction. Still, any claim is only to the probable, not the certain. The rest of Volume 1 discusses the origins of Jesus as to formative years, \\"external\\" influences (language, education, and socioeconomic status), and \\"internal\\" influences (family ties and marital and lay status). The volume concludes with a survey of Jesus' life chronology.John P. Meier, 1991. The Roots of the Problem and the Person, Yale University Press. On the question of references to Jesus in the Talmud, Meier considers the thesis of Joseph Klausner (1925) that some very few rabbinic sources, none earlier than about the late 2nd or early 3rd century, contain traces of the historical Jesus. He presents further considerations and arguments, including those of Johann Maier (talmudic scholar) (1978) who maintains that the Yeshu texts are later medieval corruptions, and writes that: :While not accepting the full, radical approach of Maier, I think we can agree with him on one basic point: in the earliest rabbinic sources, there is no clear or even probable reference to Jesus of Nazareth. Furthermore, ... when we do finally find such references in later rabbinic literature, they are most probably reactions to Christian claims, oral or written.John P. Meier, 1991. A Marginal Jew, v. 1 pp. 95, 97-98. =Volume 2= Volume 2 (1994) is in three main parts: * Jesus' relationship to John the Baptist (as 'mentor') * Jesus' message of the kingdom of God * accounts of Jesus' miracles in ancient and modern minds. The kingdom of God in the second part (pp. 235‚Äì506) is examined as to: *the Old Testament, related writings, and Qumran * Jesus' proclamation of a future kingdom * the kingdom proclaimed by Jesus' words and deeds as already present in his ministry (pp. 451‚Äì53). The third part applies the same criteria of historicity to miracle stories as to other aspects of Jesus' life. Rather than adopting say an exclusively agnostic or Christian perspective or relying on philosophical arguments whether miracles can occur, it poses narrower data-based historical questions (pp. 510‚Äì11, 517). Meier is quoted in a 1997 interview as saying: \\"The proper stance of a historian is, 'I neither claim beforehand that miracles are possible, nor do I claim beforehand they are not possible.'\\"John Bookser Feister, 1997. \\"Finding the Historical Jesus:An Interview With John P. Meier,\\" Saint Anthony Messenger, December. Meier finds that Jesus' performance of extraordinary deeds deemed miracles at the time is best supported by the criteria of multiple attestation and the coherence of Jesus' deeds and words (p. 630). In moving from the global question of miracles to the particular, Meier examines each miracle story by broad category. That examination drives the conclusion that no single theory explains all such stories with equal assurance and applicability. Rather, it is suggested that some stories have no historical basis (such as the cursing of the fig tree) and that other stories likely go back to events in the life of Jesus (though theological judgment is required to affirm any miracle) (p. 968). At the global level again, Jesus as healer is as well supported as almost anything about the historical Jesus. In the Gospels, the activity of Jesus as miracle worker looms large in attracting attention to himself and reinforces his eschatological message. Such activity, Meier suggests, might have added to the concern of authorities that culminated in Jesus' death (p. 970).John P. Meier, 1994. Mentor, Message, and Miracles, Yale University Press. =Volume 3= Volume 3 (2001) places Jesus in the context of his followers, the crowds, and his competitors (including Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Samaritans, scribes, and Zealots) in first-century Palestine.John P.

It is played on a standard eight by eight checkers board with two opposing players. The game gained popularity amongst northeastern collegiate students in the US. Gameplay Using a standard checkers set, pieces are divided into Red (light) and Black (dark). Players are traditionally referred to by the color of their pieces. The colors are chosen either by a friendly agreement, by a game of chance or by a neutral third party. Each player begins with twelve pieces which they may arrange in a configuration of their choice, confined to the back three rows of their side. These formations are agreed to by both players before the game starts. Red moves first. The players alternate moving one piece at a time. Standard (beginning) pieces move in three forward directions (relative to each player), straight ahead, and diagonal to the left or right, and move one unoccupied space at a time unless jumping. Jumping involves capturing the other player's pieces by moving two spaces in the same direction, jumping over the opponent's piece in the intermediate square. Multiple opposing pieces may be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece. Pieces must jump into an unoccupied square, and jumping enemy pieces is mandatory in all circumstances (including each successive jump). If multiple opportunities are available, players may choose which piece to jump with. Normal pieces may only jump in their three forward directions. Upgrades When a standard piece reaches the opponent's closest row (known in checkers as the crownhead or kings row), it becomes a ‚Äúking.‚Äù Pieces may be upgraded beyond this level (tier) by returning to the original players first row. The process of going back and forth further upgrades piece reaches its fifth tier (reaching the original players side for a second time). Each tier provides the upgraded piece with new abilities.Beyond Checkers * Kings are the first and most basic improvement upon the standard piece. Kings are signified by stacking two standard pieces of the original player's color (this process is referred to as ‚Äúkinging‚Äù). Kings may move and jump in any direction, but are otherwise similar to standard pieces. Kinging is only awarded at the end of the pieces movement, including mandatory successive jumps. * Triple kings (abbreviated as trip kings), the first upgrade to the king, are signified by a tier of three stacked standard pieces of the original color. They are obtained by returning a king to the owning player's closest row. Not only can triple kings jump over consecutive enemy pieces in any direction as a standard king would, they also have the ability to make standard jumps over friendly pieces. The process of jumping over a friendly piece is never mandatory, does not sacrifice the jumped piece, and does not have priority over other jumps. Triple kings can jump over both enemy and a friendly pieces in a series of jumps. Movement is identical to kings. * Quad kings, the upgrade of triple kings, have the most complex jumping rules, and consist of four stacked pieces. They do not possess the ability to jump over their own pieces as triple kings do, but do retain the ability to jump over two consecutive pieces in one jump. Quad kings have the unique ability to skip an empty space before they jump a single piece; this process has the same priority as regular jumps. Quad kings can also make normal jumps and sequences, and have the same movement as normal kings. * Ultra kings are the final piece upgrade to be attained by reaching the ends of the board, and are signified by placing an opposing player's piece color between two of your own. Ultrakings can move (teleport) to any unoccupied square. They can also capture in a way completely unique to standard checkers games. Ultrakings ‚Äúconsume‚Äù an adjacent enemy piece by moving into the occupied square. This is, similarly, a mandatory procedure. Ultra kings also possess the ability to teleport any friendly piece. This procedure is performed by moving the ultraking adjacent to the piece one turn, placing that piece on top of the Ultra king another turn (whereby the Ultra king may not attack or move), and then moving the friendly piece to any unoccupied square on the board. If a piece is teleported onto the side needed to make an upgrade, the upgrade occurs. If it is teleported, it may make no further actions for that turn. *If an ultraking is placed upon another ultraking, the resulting double ultraking can take two actions per turn (e.g. move next to an opposing piece and then consume it). Strategy The complex rules for Tiers allow for a number of successful strategies. Rapidly upgrading a single piece before the opposing player is a common and generally successful strategy. Another common practice is to trap a stronger piece by forcing it to jump into a place where it can be taken. The ability to create unique formations for each player before the game begins is also considered very important to the overall outcome of the game.

It consisted of five PMOS integrated circuits: four identical RALU chips, short for register and ALU, providing the data path, and one CROM, Control and ROM, providing control sequencing and microcode storage. The IMP-16 is a bit-slice processor. Each RALU chip provides a 4-bit slice of the register and arithmetic portion of a processor. Multiple RALU chips work in parallel, providing a longer word length. Each RALU chip provides 4 bits of the program counter, several registers, the ALU, a 16-word LIFO stack, and the status flags. \\"Use of RALU flags\\". \\"IMP-00A/520 MOS/LSI register and arithmetic logic unit (RALU)\\". p. 1 The IMP-16 provided four 16-bit accumulators, two of which could be used as index registers. The instruction set architecture was similar to that of the Data General Nova. The chip set could be extended with a multiply and divide CROM chip (IMP-16A / 522D) that implemented 16 bit multiply and divide routines using the ALU's. The chip set was driven by a two-phase 715 kHz non-overlapping clock that had a +5 to -12 voltage swing. An integral part of the architecture was a 16 bit input mux that provided various condition bits from the ALUs such as zero, carry, overflow along with general purpose inputs. The microprocessor was used in the IMP-16P microcomputer. The IMP-16 was later superseded by National Semiconductor's PACE and INS8900 single-chip 16-bit microprocessors, which had a similar architecture but were not binary compatible.

A contributor to The Atlantic since February 2001, she was a staff writer for The New Yorker in 2004 and 2005, contributing five articles, including To Hell with All That. In 2019, she was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary award. She is the author of To Hell with All That: Loving and Loathing Our Inner Housewife (2006) and Girl Land (2012).  Early life  Flanagan was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Berkeley, California. Her father is the writer Thomas Flanagan. Flanagan holds a B.A. and an M.A. (1989) in art history from the University of Virginia.  Career  Before becoming a writer, Flanagan was an English teacher and college counselor at the Harvard-Westlake School in North Hollywood, a theme she later returned to in her articles about college admissions. Flanagan's writing and social criticism frequently explore the intersection of public and private, and seek to expose hypocrisies in social narratives of the powerful and the prominent. Although such critiques sometimes use traditionally conservative arguments, Flanagan has referred to herself as a Democrat and a liberal. Bitch magazine awarded Flanagan its \\"Douchebag of the Century\\" award for her criticism of feminism. She has written, for example, about contradictory currents in the lives of American women, including herself, who discovered later in life a joy in motherhood and social value in domesticity that ran counter to the view of women's domestic lives as oppressive. Some of her essays underscore the emotional rewards and social value of a housewife's role. Consequently, she has been criticized, for instance by Joan Walsh, for misrepresenting her life choices and then condemning other women for not choosing a lifestyle Flanagan herself did not choose either. In her article \\"How Serfdom Saved the Women's Movement\\", Flanagan challenged the narrative of economic and social liberation of women credited to feminism by accusing middle-class women of succeeding at the expense of foreign nannies and illegal workers who replaced them in mothering roles. She argued that these women, while claiming to be virtuous and concerned for others, simultaneously robbed these workers by not paying Social Security taxes. Flanagan has appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report and Real Time with Bill Maher. Flanagan's book To Hell with All That: Loving and Loathing Our Inner Housewife was published by Little, Brown in 2006. The book was developed from a New Yorker essay by the same title, as well as other magazine pieces by Flanagan and new writing. In 2012, she published a book about teenage girls, Girl Land.  Personal life  Flanagan lives in Los Angeles. She has twin sons. When her children were in preschool, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which later metastasized to other parts of her body.

The show was produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions, hosted by Tom Kennedy and announced by Kenny Williams. This was Kennedy's third NBC show to debut in the span of one year; his first, 50 Grand Slam, was canceled after a 13-week run in December 1976 and was replaced by a daytime version of Name That Tune, which was canceled in June 1977 after 26 weeks. It initially fared well in the Nielsen ratings against CBS' The Young and the Restless and ABC's The Better Sex, but when The $20,000 Pyramid took over the noon slot on ABC in early 1978, the ratings began to suffer, and To Say the Least was cancelled in April of that year, with reruns of Sanford and Son taking its former time slot. Format Two teams, one consisting of men and the other women, competed. Each team consisted of one civilian player and two celebrities. The object of To Say the Least was to guess the identity of subjects in as few words as possible. For each subject, one team member played while the other two were placed in isolation. Both onstage players were shown a clue of six to ten words and the subject to which it referred. The players alternated choosing one word at a time to eliminate from the clue. At any time, either player could challenge the other team's offstage players to guess the subject, at which time they were brought back onstage and shown the clue. If the clue was reduced to a single word, the teammates of the player who eliminated the next-to-last word were forced to guess. A correct answer won the game, while a miss awarded the win to the opposing team. The first team to win two games won the match, with $100 and a prize package awarded to the civilian player. All-Star Game The winning contestant advanced with all four celebrities to play the All-Star Game for a chance at a cash jackpot. Each of the celebrities stood behind one of four numbered doors on stage, assigned in random order, and the contestant was given the subject and a clue. The contestant eliminated all but three words in the clue, after which it was shown to the first celebrity so he/she could guess. A correct response won $100 for the contestant. One more word was then eliminated, and the second celebrity then took a guess that awarded an additional $200 to the contestant if correct. Regardless of the outcome of these two guesses, the contestant removed one more word and the remaining two celebrities were given a chance to guess, one at a time. If either of them guessed correctly, the contestant won a cash jackpot that started at $2,000 and increased by $1,000 for every game it went unclaimed. Contestants remained on the show until they either lost two matches or played seven All-Star Games, whichever came first. Any contestant who won four consecutive matches received a new car. Episode status The entirety of the series is unknown. One episode is held at The Paley Center for Media, while the premiere and several others are known to circulate among video collectors; some of which are on YouTube.

The city's climate displays four very distinct seasons and great variation in temperatures over very short periods of time. Like other cities in the northern Great Plains, its climate is also fairly dry. Overview Temperatures Temperatures in Bismarck are variable throughout most of the year, with some stability in summer due to the yearly weakening of the jet stream. Nevertheless, there are four very distinct seasons, with great temperature variation. The warmest month of the year is July, when the average high temperature is . Overnight low temperatures in July average . The coldest month of the year is January, with an average high temperature of and lows of on average.

It runs along the Niagara River from the city of Buffalo to the city of Tonawanda. The southern terminus of the route is at the ramps leading to Interstate 190 exit 8 in Buffalo. Its northern terminus is at an intersection with NY 265 just south of North Tonawanda in Tonawanda. Route description Southern terminus of NY 266 at I-190 in Buffalo NY 266 begins at the end of the off-ramps for exit 8 of I-190 (the Niagara Thruway) in the city of Buffalo. Running northwest along Buffalo's West Side, NY 266 proceeds along Niagara Street, a two-lane commercial street through the city. Paralleling I-190 through the city, the route passes east of D'Youville College and through Prospect Park at the junction with Porter Avenue. Porter Avenue connects NY 266 to I-190's exit 9 just to the southwest. Bypassing all the entrance ramps to the Peace Bridge, NY 266 continues along the two-lane Niagara Street to a junction with Busti Avenue. At Busti, NY 266 and Niagara Street turn north, running in the shadows of I-190 near the Niagara River. A couple blocks north, the route reaches Robert Rich Way, which connects to Broderick Park and the wastewater treatment facility for Buffalo. NY 266 continues north on the West Side of Buffalo, crossing into a large interchange with I-190, NY 198 (the Scajaquada Expressway) and the southern terminus of NY 265 (Tonawanda Street). At this interchange, NY 266 turns northwest with Niagara Street along Scajaquada Creek and parallels I-190 into the Black Rock section of Buffalo. Soon after, the ramp from exit 12 crosses NY 266 at another Tonawanda Street and exit 13 junctions at Austin Street. The route continues northeast, crossing exit 14 at Ontario Street and entering the Riverside neighborhood of Buffalo. At Crowley Avenue, the route passes southwest of St. Francis Cemetery and Riverside Cemetery. Just north of the cemetery, the route crosses into the town of Tonawanda. NY 266 as seen from the South Grand Island Bridge heading through Tonawanda Passing General Motors Tonawanda Engine Plant, NY 266 is now known as River Road, crossing over I-190 and providing a ramp to the roadway. Just north of the ramp, the route comes to an intersection with the western end of NY 325 (Sheridan Drive). Passing a plant for Dunlop Rubber, NY 266 runs along the shores of the Niagara River through Tonawanda, passing multiple factories as well as the Huntley Generating Station as it bends northward along the shore. Crossing an intersection with County Route 189 (CR 189 or Grand Island Boulevard), NY 266 crosses under the South Grand Island Bridge, used by I-190 and NY 324\\\\. On the other side of a bridge, NY 266 connects to the roadway at exit 17. Continuing along the Niagara River, NY 266 bends northeast through Tonawanda, passing south of Isle View Park and crosses over Twomile Creek. Passing Veterans Memorial Park, the route enters the city of Tonawanda, gaining the Niagara Street moniker. Becoming a two-lane park and residential street, NY 266 passes Nia-Wanda Park and soon enters the downtown section of the city at Bouck Street. Passing north of Clinton Park, the route passes south of a large commercial development along the Niagara River, reaching a junction with NY 265 (Seymour Street) near the bridge into Niagara County and the city of North Tonawanda. History All of modern NY 266 was originally designated as part of NY 384 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 384 began at Main Street (NY 5) in Buffalo and followed Niagara Street and River Road north to the city of Tonawanda, where it turned north onto modern NY 265 and proceeded across the Erie Canal into North Tonawanda. NY 266 was assigned to the portion of modern NY 384 between Sheridan Drive (NY 324) in the town of Tonawanda and River Road (then-NY 384) in North Tonawanda. NY 384 was realigned by the following year to follow Delaware Avenue between downtown Buffalo and North Tonawanda. The change supplanted NY 266, which was reassigned to the portion of NY 384's original, riverside routing south of NY 265 in the city of Tonawanda. The south end of the route was shifted three blocks west to Niagara Square in the 1960s after NY 5 was realigned through downtown Buffalo to serve the square. NY 266 was truncated again in the early 1970s to begin at the newly constructed ramps leading to Interstate 190 exit 8.

Originally a small community built around agriculture, the convergence of several railroads made the city a strategic location for several expanding industries. During the time, Dallas prospered and grew to become the most populous city in Texas,: The city surpassed was Houston. Alongside strong population growth, Dallas annexed the city of East Dallas, which placed it ahead of Houston. lavish steel and masonry structures replaced timber constructions, Dallas Zoo, Southern Methodist University, and an airport were established. Conversely, the city suffered multiple setbacks with a recession from a series of failing markets (the \\"Panic of 1893\\") and the disastrous flooding of the Trinity River in the spring of 1908. The Praetorian Building (1909) was the city's first skyscraper, soaring 190 feet above Main Street was demolished in 2013.  Shift to industry  An advertisement for the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad in an 1881 Dallas city directory The shift towards manufacturing and heavy industry in Dallas formed partially out of problems hurting Dallas area cotton farmers. After purchasing supplies on credit during the year, farmers owed merchants most of their crop, whose price was lowered by the high shipping costs to the port of Galveston. Worldwide cotton prices were low, due to overproduction. The Farmers' Alliance, created in 1877, hoped to help farmers by setting up a Dallas warehouse to ship cotton to St. Louis. However, bankers refused to finance the warehouse, and the venture failed within twenty months. There was little manufacturing in Dallas. The city began to light its streets with gas lamps in 1874 and began to brick over dirt lanes. In 1880, the first telephone switchboard came to Dallas, linking the water company and the fire station.Dallas Historical Society - Dallas History . Retrieved on April 20, 2006.

By the turn of the century, Dallas was the leading wholesale market in the entire Southwestern United States for many products. More important it became the world center for the cotton trade. It led the world in the manufacturing of saddlery and cotton gin machinery. As it further entered the 20th century, Dallas built up a major presence in banking and insurance. Progressive reform Progressive Era reformers sought to improve municipal government by such changes as the commission system, city planning, and zoning controls. The interests of white business and residential districts were protected, but sometimes at the expense of blacks who lived in segregated neighborhoods.Patricia E. Gower, \\"The Price of Exclusion: Dallas Municipal Policy and its Impact on African Americans.\\" East Texas Historical Journal 2001 39(1): 43-54. Fairbanks (1999) explores the changing assumptions about city planning and government among the city's leaders. Dissatisfied with its haphazard development they endorsed centralized planning and wrote and secured the adoption of a new charter and set up a board of commissioners. The commission structure, however, caused government officials to view the city in separate parts rather than as a whole. By the 1920s supporters of comprehensive planning were calling for a program that included adoption of council-manager government, a citywide zoning policy, and public funds for improvements in parks, sewers, schools, and city streets. Voters approved the bond proposals and charter amendments in 1927 and 1930. Dallas thus achieved a more coordinated government which was theoretically more aware of the city's needs and more able to treat those needs equally for the benefit of the city as a whole. Self image The city's fathers originally depicted Dallas as southern in order to rationalize slavery and opposition to Reconstruction, but this discouraged Northern investment and the political support of wealthy northern migrants to the city. From the 1870s on, Dallas leaders portrayed the city as southwestern, or later as part of the \\"Sunbelt\\", in order to incorporate wealthy non-southern whites, including Jews, into society. For example, between 1852 and 1925 the seven Sanger brothers built successful mercantile businesses along developing railroad lines, including the Sanger Bros. department store, and occupied numerous city and state government posts.Rose G. Biderman, \\"The Sanger Brothers and Their Role in Texas History.\\" Western States Jewish History 1996 28(2): 149-158. White blue collar workers were marginalized, and even more so the Mexican Americans, and blacks.See Michael Phillips, White Metropolis: Race, Ethnicity, and Religion in Dallas, 1841-2001. (2006). Gender Women did much to establish the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle-class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics in the name of social issues.Elizabeth York Enstam, Women and the Creation of Urban Life: Dallas, Texas, 1843-1920. (1998). During 1913‚Äì19, advocates of woman suffrage drew on the educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings to the task of political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.Elizabeth York Enstam, \\"The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association, Political Style, and Popular Culture: Grassroots Strategies of the Woman Suffrage Movement, 1913-1919.\\" Journal of Southern History 2002 68(4): 817-848. Women of color usually operated separately. Juanita Craft (1902‚Äì85) was a leader in the civil rights movement through the Dallas NAACP. She focused on working with black youths, organizing them as the vanguard of protests against segregationist practices in Texas.Stefanie Decker, \\"Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Juanita Craft Versus the Dallas Elite.\\" East Texas Historical Journal 2001 39(1): 33-42.  Great Trinity River Flood of 1908  The relationship between Dallas and the Trinity River was never as healthy as Dallasites hoped it would be. Dallas was established on the banks of the Trinity in hopes that navigation south to the Trinity and Galveston Bays, and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico, would eventually be possible. However, attempts to move even paddleboats up and down the river proved futile, and plans to transform the river into a canal never came to fruition. The Trinity also suffered from chronic flooding: floods occurred in 1844, 1866, 1871, and 1890, but none were as severe as the flood of 1908. On May 26, 1908, the Trinity River reached a depth of and a width of . Five people died, 4,000 were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at $2.5 million. Dallas was without power for three days, all telephone and telegraph service was down, and rail service was canceled. The only way to reach Oak Cliff was by boat. West Dallas was hit harder than any other part of the city--the Dallas Times Herald said \\"indescribable suffering\\" plagued the area. Much to the horror of residents, thousands of livestock drowned in the flood and some became lodged in the tops of trees--the stench of their decay hung over the city as the water subsided. The Trinity River flooding on July 8, 1908. Flood control Efforts to repair the damage caused by the flood and prevent future disasters began in 1911 when George Kessler, a city planner, created a plan for both the Trinity and the city. His plans included using levees to divert the river, removing railroad lines on Pacific Avenue, consolidating train depots into a central station, new parks and playgrounds, and the straightening and widening of several streets. Most of his plans went unimplemented for one or two decades, but in later years, many city officials began to see their importance. Kessler was brought back in 1920 to update his plans, and by the 1930s many had been realized. After the disastrous flood, the city wanted to find a way to control the reckless Trinity and to build a bridge linking Oak Cliff and Dallas. The city and citizens' immediate reaction was to clamor for the construction of an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity. This had already been attempted following the 1890 flood--the result was the \\"Long Wooden Bridge,\\" an unstable structure which had connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz Street in Dallas until being washed away in the 1908 flood. George B. Dealey, publisher of the Dallas Morning News, proposed a concrete bridge similar to one crossing the Missouri River in Kansas City. Soon, a US$650,000 bond program was approved in a city election, and the new Oak Cliff viaduct (now the Houston Street Viaduct) was opened in 1912 among festivities that drew 58,000 spectators. The bridge, at the time, was the longest concrete structure in the world.  Financial center  Efforts began in 1910 to have Southwestern University in Georgetown relocate to Dallas. The school refused, but this action brought Dallas to the attention of the Methodists. They voted in 1911 to establish a university in Dallas, after the city offered $300,000 and of land for the campus. The result of this agreement, Southern Methodist University, opened in 1915 and remains operational today. In 1911, Dallas became the location of the eleventh regional branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. The city had campaigned to have it located in Dallas for years, and the bank's arrival assured Dallas's place as a major financial center. In 1912, The Adolphus Hotel was constructed in downtown Dallas. The Beaux Arts style building, at twenty-one stories and was the tallest building in Texas at the time. It officially opened on October 5, 1912. In August 1922, the 29-story Magnolia Petroleum Building (now the Magnolia Hotel) opened next door and took the title of tallest-in- Texas.Dallassky.com - Magnolia Building.

Love Field was established by the U.S. Army as an aviation training ground, and Fair Park was home to Camp Dick, another training facility. The city of Dallas purchased Love Field in 1927 to use as a municipal airport, and Camp Dick was dissolved in 1919.

He was only able to hold the city of Dunhuang for several months, before Juqu Mengxun successfully sieged the city, and Li Xun committed suicide.  Brief reign  Very little is known about Li Xun's life, including whether he was the son of his brother Li Xin's mother Princess Dowager Yin. Under his father Li Gao (Prince Wuzhao) and/or Li Xin, Li Xun successively served as the governor of Jiuquan (ÈÖíÊ≥â, roughly modern Jiuquan, Gansu) and Dunhuang Commanderies. His rule of Dunhuang was said to be benevolent and favored by the people. In 420, while trying to attack Northern Liang, Li Xin fell into a trap set by Juqu Mengxun and was killed in battle. Juqu Mengxun then quickly reached the Western Liang capital Jiuquan, and Li Xin's other brothers abandoned Jiuquan and fled to Dunhuang. Once they reached Dunhuang, they and Li Xun, then the governor of Dunhuang, abandoned Dunhuang and fled to the hills north of Dunhuang. Juqu Mengxun commissioned Suo Yuanxu () to be the governor of Dunhuang. However, Suo quickly lost favor with the people by being rude, dishonest, and cruel. Some people of Dunhuang, under the leadership of Song Cheng () and Zhang Hong (), secretly invited Li Xun back to Dunhuang, and in winter 420 he did so, forcing Suo to flee. Song and Zhang offered Li Xun the titles of General Guanjun () and Governor of Liang Province (), and he changed the era name to signify that Western Liang was still a state. Juqu Mengxun then sent his heir apparent Juqu Zhengde () to attack Dunhuang, and Li Xun defended the city, refusing to engage Juqu Zhengde. However, Juqu Mengxun soon arrived, and he built levees to accumulate water around Dunhuang. Li Xun offered to surrender, but Juqu Mengxun refused. At this point, Song Cheng betrayed him and offered the city to Juqu Mengxun. Upon hearing this, Li Xun committed suicide, and Juqu Mengxun slaughtered the city. Western Liang was at its end.

Givhan was a fashion editor for The Washington Post. She joined the Post in 1995, and left in 2010 to become the fashion critic and fashion correspondent for The Daily Beast and Newsweek. She returned to the \\"Post\\" in 2014. Givhan won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 2006, the first time the award was given to a fashion writer. The Pulitzer Committee cited Givhan's \\"witty, closely observed essays that transform fashion criticism into cultural criticism.\\" Background She is a native of Detroit, MI. She was the valedictorian at Renaissance High School in 1982, graduated from Princeton University in 1986, and holds a master's degree in journalism from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After working for the Detroit Free Press for about seven years, she held positions at the San Francisco Chronicle and Vogue magazine. Givhan appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report in January 2006. In 2009 she moved from New York City to Washington, D.C., where her fashion beat was expanded to also cover First Lady Michelle Obama. Opinions Givhan generated an uproar on July 20, 2007, when she penned a Washington Post opinion piece that drew attention to an outfit worn by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during her July 18 speech on the Senate floor. Givhan said Sen. Clinton's slightly V-shaped neckline was \\"unnerving\\" and \\"startling,\\" especially for a woman \\"who has been so publicly ambivalent about style, image and the burdens of both.\\" She added, \\"[I]t was more like catching a man with his fly unzipped. Just look away!\\" Givhan has made a reputation for being blunt. In an interview on writers who cover the fashion industry, Givhan told CBS News, \\"There are a lot of people who sort of say that something is good or important or progressive or edgy when in fact, it's just crappy. And no one will just say it's crappy.\\" She added, \\"I'll also say when I think something is absolutely magnificent.\\" Commenting on a heavy, dark-green parka worn by Vice President Dick Cheney at a ceremony in 2005 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Givhan wrote, \\"It's the kind of attire one typically wears to operate a snow blower.... Here he was wearing something that visually didn't symbolize to me the level of solemnity and respect that I thought a service like this demanded... He was representing the American people. I don't want to be represented by someone in, you know, a parka who looks like he's at a Green Bay Packer game.\\" She also slammed the attire worn by the wife and young children of Supreme Court nominee John Roberts during his swearing in as Supreme Court Chief Justice, saying they resembled \\"a trio of Easter eggs, a handful of jelly bellies, three little Necco wafers.\\" In August 2009, she criticized First Lady Michelle Obama for wearing shorts while on a family vacation. \\"Avoiding the appearance of queenly behavior is politically wise. But it does American culture no favors if a first lady tries so hard to be average that she winds up looking common,\\" wrote Givhan on the subject of the first lady's attire.Givhan, Robin (August 23, 2009), \\"A Judgment Call That Comes Up a Bit Short\\", Washington Post. Givhan continued her criticism in the Washington Post of January 3, 2010, complaining the First Lady lacked \\"focus\\" in her advocacy.

Initially known as Freight Victoria, it operated rail freight services and controlled non-urban rail track in the state of Victoria, later expanding into freight haulage in other states. Freight Australia was sold to Pacific National in August 2004. Background V/Line formerly had a freight division, known as V/Line Freight. Under the Kennett State Government, V/Line was split into two separate entities on 1 July 1997: V/Line Passenger and V/Line Freight, with separate management to each other in preparation for privatisation. When V/Line was privatised in 1999, the passenger and freight divisions were sold separately.

The newest and most powerful locomotives were the 3,300 hp G class delivered from 1984, but other locomotives dated as far back as the 1950s. With traffic growing Freight Victoria decided to replace the prime movers in number of the G class, increasing the power output to 3,800 hp. The older X class diesels also saw a more extensive power upgrade program, being stripped to the frame and rebuilt as the XR class. The company only purchased a single new locomotive, V544 which was built new in 2002 to replace two written off G class locomotives. Additional rollingstock was also acquired, including new 100 tonne capacity grain hoppers built by Alstom at the Ballarat North Workshops, second hand grain hoppers from FreightCorp, and the conversion of surplus vans into log and container flats. To fulfill a contractual condition with customer CRT Group that if Freight Australia was acquired by a competitor of CRT Group, of locomotive power (calculated by the business CRT Group was offering Freight Australia) was to be transferred to them, two G and two X class locomotives were transferred to CRT Group. The balance of the fleet was included in the sale to Pacific National.

Meadowbrook is centered on open fields adjacent to the Community Center, Meadowbrook swimming pool, and Nathan Hale High School. It is bounded on the south by NE 95th Street and the Wedgwood neighborhood, on the north by NE 120th Street and Cedar Park, on the west by Lake City Way NE (State Route 522-SR 522) and Victory Heights., and on the east by 35th Avenue NE and Matthews Beach. See heading, \\"Note about limitations of these data\\". The neighborhood is almost entirely residential. There are no commercial strips, though there are some small restaurants and other businesses. The area is served by a number of public schools, including John Rogers Elementary, Jane Addams Middle School, and Nathan Hale High School.The site where Nathan Hale High School now sits was formerly Meadowbrook Golf Course.  History  Meadowbrook Pond, July 2009 Meadowbrook, with Thornton Creek near Lake Washington, has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE--10,000 years ago).

The Lake City area was clearcut by crude wagon road or by using Lake Washington from 1850 through the start of the 20th century, more rapidly with the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (c. 1886) providing easy access along what is now the Burke-Gilman Trail through adjacent Matthews Beach neighborhood and along the lake. A Little Germany neighborhood of several immigrant farmers grew up in the 1870s around where Nathan Hale High School now stands.Wilma The Blindheim family LaVilla Dairy,http://northonline.sccd.ctc.edu/cl/elh/cases/case05B/5B-AR-2_thumb.jpg located on what is now the 10300 block of Fischer Place NE,http://northonline.sccd.ctc.edu/cl/elh/cases/case05B/5B-AR-1_thumb.jpg and the orchards extending up the adjacent hill to the east are defining characteristics of Meadowbrook. The dairy operated from 1913 to 1929, although it was occupied until 1990. The dairy was also called La Villa. Both the dairy building and the family house still stand. Traces of the original Bothell- Everett highway can still be found nearby. The centerpiece of Meadowbrook is on land sold by the family to the City for the park (as well as for other green space).

A small herbivore, it is very poorly known. Two species have been assigned to it, but as the original name is based on teeth, there is no concrete evidence to connect the two species. Its fossils have been found in China. Description Gongbusaurus, by extrapolation from the remains of possible species \\"G.\\" wucaiwanensis and other basal ornithopods, was a herbivorous bipedal animal around long. The tibia of \\"G.\\" wucaiwanensis is 19.5 centimetres long. It would have been a strong runner. Classification \\"Gongbusaurus\\" wucaiwanensis (\\"Eugongbusaurus\\") skull IVPP 14559 Dong Zhiming, Zhou Shiwu, and Zhang Zicheng, who originally described the type species G. shiyii, thought it was most similar to Fabrosaurus and assigned it to the nebulous Fabrosauridae. Upon description of the second species \\"G.\\" wucaiwanensis several years later, Dong elected to assign it to Hypsilophodontidae, an equally nebulous (paraphyletic) family of somewhat more derived small bipedal ornithischians, while at about the same time, David B. Weishampel and Larry Witmer found Gongbusaurus to be an indeterminate basal ornithischian. The most recent reviews also found the genus to be a dubious ornithischian, and recommended renaming the better-known second species. Peter Galton has noted that the teeth on which Gongbusaurus is based resemble those of Sarcolestes and Gastonia, so the genus may actually be an ankylosaurian. History Dong and his coauthors established Gongbusaurus on two small teeth, holotype IVPP V9069: one, V9069-1, from the beak (premaxilla), and the other, V9069-2, from the cheek (maxilla). These remains came from the Oxfordian-age Upper Shaximiao Formation in Sichuan, China and were found by a unit of the Chinese aerial survey behind an elementary school in the village of Huangtong, part of the Duxin commune, in Rongxian or Rong County. The type species Gongbusaurus shiyii was named and described by Dong, Zhou, and Zhang in 1983. The generic name is derived from the imperial ministry, bu, of public works, gong, in honour of the great poet Du Fu who in Sichuan worked for that ministry after 760, in the rank of shi yi, \\"junior consultant\\", which explains the specific name. As shi yi also can mean \\"register of lost objects\\" the specific name is at the same time a pun on the fact that the teeth were later separately found among the assorted bones collected during the dig. Dong added a second species, \\"G.\\" wucaiwanensis, in 1989 for a fragmentary skeleton (holotype IVPP 8302) including a partial lower jaw, three tail vertebrae, and a partial forelimb, and added another specimen (paratype IVPP 8303) consisting of two hip vertebrae, eight tail vertebrae, and two complete hind limbs. A partial foot (IVPP 8304) and four separate dorsal vertebrae and a caudal vertebra were referred. These remains came from the roughly contemporaneous Shishugou Formation of Wucaiwan, Xinjiang. Tooth species are not well regarded in dinosaur paleontology, because dinosaur teeth are generally not distinctive enough to hold a name. Therefore, it is unsurprising that other paleontologists have suggested removing \\"G.\\" wucaiwanensis. A possible replacement name, \\"Eugongbusaurus\\", has accidentally gotten to the public, but remains informal.

He and Carmela do not know how to punish her. She prompts them to take away her credit card for three weeks, while still providing cash for gas. She walks away, smiling to herself. At first, Janice defends Meadow, saying she is showing her independence. But when she sees the state of the house, she is furious. Tony and Carmela tell her to stop interfering. Janice says she ought to leave, but she and Carmela later reconcile and she is persuaded to continue to stay at the house. Meadow overhears their argument. When Tony goes to the house to have the locks changed, Meadow is kneeling on the floor, scrubbing. Tony turns away, perplexed by this remorse. Jackie Aprile's elder brother Richie is released after ten years' imprisonment. He says he has changed, taken up meditation and learned yoga, but he cannot accept other changes: that Tony, a younger man, is boss, and that he does not immediately get the same benefits as before. When Tony says these things will come in time, Richie says, \\"What's mine is not yours to give me.\\" Richie demands payments from a former associate, \\"Beansie\\" Gaeta, now the proprietor of some pizzerias. Beansie refuses; Richie viciously assaults him. One night, he waits in a parking lot, draws his gun, and tells Beansie to show him proper respect. Beansie manages to escape. Later, thinking it is safe, he returns to his car. Richie drives up fast and rams into him; then, as he lies on the ground, drives over him. In the hospital, Beansie is told he may never walk again. Tony tells Richie emphatically, \\"I'm the one who calls the shots,\\" and if he does not show respect they \\"have a problem, a bad one.\\" Richie meets with Junior, and says, \\"I'm yours, Junior. Whatever, whoever. You just say it.\\" He happens to meet Janice at a yoga class, and tries to revive the intimacy they had years ago.

He followed his nephew Eberhard as Duke of Bavaria in 938. It is known that Berthold was a count in the March of Carinthia in 926 while his elder brother Arnulf the Bad was Bavarian duke. In 927 German King Henry the Fowler vested him with ducal rights in Carinthia. When in 938, Arnulf's son and successor Eberhard tried to retain the autonomous status of the Bavarian duchy, he was removed and banished by King Otto I the Great, who appointed Berthold in his place. Unlike the powerful late duke Arnulf, Berthold was not given the right to appoint bishops or administer royal property, but he remained loyal to the Ottonian dynasty throughout his reign. He even planned to marry Otto's sister Gerberga, widow of Duke Gilbert of Lorraine, and later Hedwige, another sister, but these plans fell through. Instead he married Biltrude, a Bavarian noblewoman, about 939. In 943, he dealt defeat to the Magyars at the battle of Wels (12 August) and staved off their attacks for a while, as Arnulf had done before him. With Berthold's accession to the throne, Bavaria and the Carinthian march were once again united. After his death in 947 however King Otto I the Great did not enfeoff Berthold's minor son Henry the Younger with his duchy, but instead gave it to his own brother Henry I, who had married Arnulf's daughter Judith. In 976 Henry the Younger received the severed Duchy of Carinthia in compensation. Duke Berthold is buried at Niederaltaich Abbey.

There are button-activated traffic light crossings at most major road-trail intersections. For safety reasons, cyclists are no longer allowed to ride on the Princes Freeway (or any other urban freeway). The Federation Trail therefore is the preferred alternative route. West of Werribee, where the Federation Trail ends, Geelong cyclists may use the freeway shoulders, as it is then considered a rural freeway. The trail was officially opened on 22 October 2006. In 2010 work started on extending the trail from Millers Road to Williamstown Rd. Completion of stage 1 of the VicRoads Truck Action Plan should see the trail finally connected from Williamstown Road to the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail on Hyde Street. In March 2011, work on the extension stopped completely, due to a change of government and troubles with funding and design of the bridge to Fogarty Avenue. Thirteen hundred metres of concrete path had been built which lay idle until November 2014, when the bridge was completed. In November 2014, VicRoads announced that the trail has been extended from Millers Road to Fogarty Avenue in Yarraville with the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge over the Brooklyn freight line. The next two stages include extending the trail to Williamstown Road and Hyde Street. An interactive map of the trail as well as others in the Melbourne area is available from the 'External Links' section in this article. Route Much of the trail follows the historic reservation of the heritage listed Main Outfall Sewer which was built in the 1890s. At that time the sewer was the largest civil engineering project ever undertaken in Victoria. The associated pumping station can be found in the Scienceworks Museum complex. In recent years, the Greening the Pipeline initiative is exploring opportunities to transform the Main Outfall Sewer into a parkland to connect communities, and provide a unique space to meet, play and relax. This project is a partnership between Melbourne Water, Wyndham City Council, VicRoads and City West Water. The project is supported by Greening the West. Snakes may be seen in the Skeleton Creek and Werribee River areas during hot weather. Walkers are advised to stay on the path to enjoy the scenery. Landmarks include the Kororoit Creek, a tunnel under the Western Ring Road freeway, RAAF Williams (Laverton base), Lawrie Emmins Reserve, Skeleton Creek, Werribee Mercy Hospital, Victoria University (Werribee campus), Werribee Park, Werribee Open Range Zoo, and the Werribee River. =Connections= The western terminus of the trail is with its junction with the Werribee River Trail at Werribee where there is access to the Princes Freeway at this point. Near Hoppers Crossing it intersects with the upper section of the Skeleton Creek Trail. The trail intersects the Western Ring Road Trail west of Millers Road. The eastern terminus of the trail is at Millers Road in Brooklyn, near Altona North. The Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail can be accessed by relatively quiet back streets: At the east end of the trail, cross Fogarty Avenue to the shared path that accesses Mill Avenue and Benbow Street. Go north on Wembley Avenue to Freame Street. Take Drew Street to Austin Crescent East via the Stony Creek footbridge and then Anderson Street and Schild Street to the Bay Trail at Hyde Street. Be cautious on Anderson Street between Williamstown Road and Schild Street. Another option of riding into the Melbourne City Centre is to leave the Federation Trail at Geelong Road and ride along the service lanes (and a pedestrian subway under the railway) to connect with one of the numerous paths or streets which go east-west through the Footscray area.

The only species is Gongxianosaurus shibeiensis. Based on four fragmentary to complete specimens found in China (Sichuan Province), it is one of the most completely known early sauropods. The skeleton is known in large part, missing both the hand and the majority of the skull. Gongxianosaurus was firstly named and described in a short note published in 1998; however, a comprehensive description has yet to be published. Gongxianosaurus shibeiensis was named for the place it was found, near the village Shibei in Gong County (ÁèôÂéø; Pinyin: G«íng Xi√†n). Description Gongxianosaurus may have reached in length. Like other sauropods, it moved quadrupedally (on four legs), as indicated by the elongated fore limbs that reached 70 to 75% of hind limb length. The pedal phalanges were short and robust, as typical for sauropods. The pedal phalangeal formula, counting the number of phalanges for each digit starting from the innermost, was 2-3-4-5-1. All but the outermost digit ended in claws. Unlike in other sauropods, pleurocoels (deep lateral excavations of the vertebrae) were absent; thus, the vertebrae would have been quite massive. The sacrum was made of three fused sacral vertebrae, fewer than in later sauropods. The chevrons were unbifurcated. An important characteristic of sauropod limbs is their reduced ossification ‚Äì the tendency to replace bone by cartilage. Gongxianosaurus is the only known sauropod with ossified distal tarsals. Thus, either Gongxianosaurus was one of the basalmost sauropods, or ossified distal tarsals were present in other early sauropods but are simply not preserved due to the fragmentation of the specimens. Classification {style=\\"margin-left: 1em;; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 248px; border: #99B3FF solid 1px; background-color: #FFFFFF; color: #000000; float: right; \\"  Basal Sauropod phylogeny simplified after Apaldetti et al. (2011). } Because the fossils are not fully described yet, available character information that can be used in cladistic analyses is limited. Thus, only few cladistical analyses have incorporated Gongxianosaurus. A recent analysis by Apaldetti et al. (2011) suggests that Gongxianosaurus was more basal than Vulcanodon, Tazoudasaurus and Isanosaurus, but more derived than the early sauropods Antetonitrus, Lessemsaurus, Blikanasaurus, Camelotia and Melanorosaurus. Discovery Gongxianosaurus fossils were found near the village of Shibei (Sichuan province) in purple mudstones pertaining to the Ziliujing Formation (Dongyueshan Member). These rocks are considered to be Toarcian in age (182.7 to 174.1 mya). Thus, Gongxianosaurus is geologically younger than the \\"prosauropod\\" Lufengosaurus but older than the basal sauropod Shunosaurus. The fossils were found in May 1997 during a geological exploration. Excavation started in the same month and led to the recovery of a wealth of fossils in an area of approximately 200 square meters. While most fossils pertain to a new sauropod genus, remains of theropods have also been found. The sauropod material includes four fragmentary to complete individuals similar in size, together encompassing most of the skeleton, though hand and skull bones were not found except a premaxilla and teeth. In 1998, the sauropod material was briefly described as a new genus and species, Gongxianosaurus shibeiensis, in a preliminary note by palaeontologists led by He Xinlu. A more detailed description was announced, noting that excavation was still in progress while the paper was published. In 2000, a second short description was published by Luo Yaonan and Wang Changsheng, also presenting Gongxianosaurus as a new sauropod and without mentioning the first description that was published two years before. Also, much of the information published by Luo and Wang was already published by He and colleagues. Luo and Wang suggest that several bones may do not pertain to the type species Gongxianosaurus shibeiensis but to a second species of Gongxianosaurus.

The resulting prices serve as signals communicated between producers and consumers which serve to guide the production and distribution of resources. Through the free price system, supplies are rationed, income is distributed, and resources are allocated. A free price system contrasts with a fixed price system where prices are administered by government in a controlled market. The price system, whether free or controlled, contrasts with physical and non-monetary economic planning. Mechanics of a free price system A diagram presenting the argument for free prices Rather than prices being set by the state, as in a command economy with a fixed price system, prices are determined in a decentralized fashion by trades that occur as a result of sellers' asking prices matching buyers' bid prices as a result of subjective value judgement in a market economy. Since resources of consumers are limited at any given time, consumers are relegated to satisfying wants in a descending hierarchy and bidding prices relative to the urgency of a variety of wants. This information on relative values is communicated, through price signals, to producers whose resources are also limited. In turn, relative prices for the productive services are established. The interchange of these two sets of prices establish market value, and serve to guide the rationing of resources, distributing income, and allocating resources. Those goods which command the highest prices (when summed among all individuals) provide an incentive for businesses to provide these goods in a corresponding descending hierarchy of priority. However, the ordering of this hierarchy of wants is not constant. Consumer preferences change. When consumer preferences for a good increase, then bidding pressure raises the price for a particular good as it moves to a higher position in the hierarchy. As a result of higher prices for this good, more productive forces are applied to satisfying the demand driven by the opportunity for higher profits in satisfying this new consumer preference. In other words, the high price sends a price signal to producers. This causes producers to increase supply, either by the same firms increasing production or new businesses coming into the market, which eventually lowers the price and the profit incentive to increase supplies. Hence, the now lower price provides a price signal to producers to decrease production and, as a result, a surplus is prevented. Since resources are scarce (including labor and capital), supplies of other goods will be diminished as the productive resources are taken from other areas of production to be applied toward increasing output of the good that has risen in the hierarchy of consumer preferences. Also, as resources become more scarce the price increases, which signals to consumers to reduce consumption thereby ensuring that the quantity demanded does not exceed the quantity supplied. It is in this way that the free price system persuades consumers to ration dwindling resources. Hence, supply and demand affect price, while at the same time price affects supply and demand. If prices remain high because increases in supply cannot keep pace with demand, then this also signals other business to provide substitute goods in order to take advantage of profit opportunities. Individual employments and incomes are also guided by the price system. Employment will move toward those goods and services that consumers value and away from those with declining importance to consumers as a result of changes in prices.

The fact that Rhun seems to have been Causant√≠n's brother-in-law could account for Causant√≠n's interference in the kingship of Alt Clut. The Viking destruction of the capital fortress of the Kingdom of Alt Clut appears to have brought about a reorientation of the kingdom towards the valley of the River Clyde. In consequence, the realm came to be known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Either Rhun or his father could have been the first kings of Strathclyde. In the years following the fall of Alt Clut, Rhun's realm may have endured periods of Pictish and Viking overlordship. Despite his kinship with the Pictish king, there is reason to suspect that the two clashed at some point. It is unknown when Rhun's reign came to an end or when he died. One possibility is that he fell with Causant√≠n, who seems to have been killed warring against the Vikings in 876. Certainly, Rhun's son, Eochaid, is recorded to have succeeded Causant√≠n's successor, √Åed mac Cin√°eda, King of the Picts, after 878. Whether Eochaid's succession reflects the end of Eochaid's reign and life is unknown. Family Locations relating to Rhun's life and times. Rhun's patrilineal ancestry is evidenced by a pedigree preserved within a collection of tenth-century Welsh genealogical material known as the Harleian genealogies. According to this source, Rhun was a son of Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, King of Alt Clut, and descended from a long line of kings of Alt Clut.Guy (2016) pp. 6 tab. 1, 22‚Äì23; Clarkson (2014) chs. genealogical tables, 1 ¬∂ 23, 2 ¬∂ 21; Clarkson (2010) chs. genealogical tables, introduction ¬∂ 12, 2 ¬∂ 35; Broun (2004c) p. 117; Dumville (1999) p. 110; √ì Corr√°in (1998a) ¬ß 38; √ì Corr√°in (1998b) p. 331; Woolf (1998) pp. 159‚Äì160; Williams; Smyth; Kirby (1991) p. 134; Macquarrie (1990) p. 7; Anderson, AO (1922) pp. clvii‚Äìclviii; Phillimore (1888) pp. 172‚Äì173; Skene (1867) p. 15.

The razing of Dunblane could be evidence that the Kingdom of Alt Clut was in the process of extending its authority at the expense of the Pictish regime.

Conversely, if there was no strife between Rhun and Arthgal, Causant√≠n's actions against the latter may have been carried out in the context of an intrusive and aggressive neighbour.

Another possibility is that, following the conquest of Alt Clut, Arthgal ruled as a puppet king under Amla√≠b and √çmar. Certainly, the Vikings utilised royal puppets in the conquered kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia.

The No. 77 consisted of around 225 grams (8 ounces) of white phosphorus, an impact fuze and a tin casing. It was intended for laying down smoke screens and as a signalling device. The grenade was also very effective as an anti-personnel, incendiary weapon. As well as being issued to the Home Guard, the No. 77 grenade was issued to the British army. This grenade was fitted with an \\"all-ways\\" action impact fuze designed to set the grenade off when it hit a surface - the fuze was called \\"all-ways\\" as it was designed to work no matter which way the grenade landed. Once the grenade exploded, the contents (i.e. the white phosphorus) scattered and ignited as soon as they touched the air. This made the grenade extremely dangerous -- hence its usefulness in combat. When the war had ended, many of the grenades had become dangerous, due to corroding of the inferior tin plate steel used in the manufacture of the grenade bodies. In 1948 the grenade was determined to be obsolete and all were destroyed to minimize the danger they could cause. However, these were produced and used in Canada until the 1950s, for the quality and manufacturing of them was better than found in Britain.. References to the No. 77 smoke grenade could also still be found in Dutch army manuals up to the fifties, coded as \\"C-hgr Nr 77\\", (chemische handgranaat nummer 77) indicating its use up to that decade in Western Europe.

It is a microraptorine dromaeosaurid. The type species Graciliraptor lujiatunensis was first named and described in 2004 by Xu Xing and Wang Xiaoling. The generic name is derived from Latin gracilis and raptor. The specific name refers to the village Lujiatun where the fossil site is located. Its fossil, holotype IVPP V 13474, was found in Beipiao, Liaoning Province, China. Description Restoration The type and only known specimen comprised part of the maxilla with some teeth, nearly complete fore and hind legs; and ten partial tail vertebrae. It is estimated to have been about long in life.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave higher estimations of one metre and 1.5 kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 132 Graciliraptor is extremely lightly built for a non-avian theropod, with very elongated middle caudal vertebrae and lower leg bones. The femur is thirteen centimetres long and total body length was estimated at one metre. The posterior articular processes of the tail vertebrae, or postzygapophyses, are connected by a thin bone sheath or lamina, that extends to the back over an eighth of the centrum of the following vertebra, thus further stiffening the middle tail, already immobilised by the typical dromaeosaurid long prezygapophyses.Xu, X. and Wang, X.-L. (2004). \\"A New Dromaeosaur (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Western Liaoning.\\" Vertebrata PalAsiatica, 42(2): 11-119. Graciliraptor has been found in the lowest portions of the Yixian Formation, the Lujiatun Member, below the rocks where similar early dromaeosaurids (such as Sinornithosaurus and Microraptor) were found. It is, in geological age, the oldest named dromaeosaurid, and the oldest known from good fossil remains (dromaeosaurid fossils date back all the way to the Middle Jurassic, but consist mostly of teeth). Classification As an early dromaeosaurid, Graciliraptor provided information on the early evolution and diversification of the group. It shares several characteristics in common with both early troodontids and avialan birds, supporting a close relationship between avialans, troodontids, and dromaeosaurids. Xu and Wang considered Graciliraptor to have been closely related to Microraptor, a similar dromaeosaurid from the slightly younger Jiufotang Formation. Later it was placed in the Microraptorinae.F.

Background and education Meade was the only son of Richard Meade, 2nd Earl of Clanwilliam, and Caroline, Countess Thun and succeeded in the earldom at the age of ten. His early years were spent in Vienna, where his father had moved after a series of bitter quarrels with his own parents about his marriage and about their enormous debts, which deprived him of what should have been a great inheritance. After his father's death Richard was raised by relatives in England. He was educated at Eton. In his 1848 memoirs, Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand writes of Meade that \\"at the head of the younger [London dandies of the 1820s] . . . Lord Clanwilliam was prominent, the son, it was said, of the Duc de Richelieu. He did wonderful things: he rode his horse to Richmond, and returned to Almack's having fallen off twice. He had a certain trick of speaking in the manner of Alcibiades, which delighted.\\" Diplomatic and political career Lord Clanwilliam joined the Diplomatic Service. He attended Lord Castlereagh's suite at the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and was his private secretary from 1817‚Äì19 in the latter's capacity as Foreign Secretary. He was one of the first people to see Castlereagh's widow after his suicide: she embraced him warmly, saying that Castlereagh had loved him. It was he who was largely responsible for the decision to give Lord Castlereagh an official funeral in Westminster Abbey, for which he was criticised by those who believed that Castlereagh's own wish was for a private family funeral. He was one of many witnesses who later testified to Castlereagh's increasingly strange mental condition in the days before his suicide. He became Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1822 and afterwards Envoy to Berlin from 1823 to 1827. In 1828, he was created Baron Clanwilliam, of Clanwilliam in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

One day at Walmer the Duke drove out with Lord Clanwilliam, who had been chef de chancellerie to the Duke‚Äôs mission at the Congress of Verona, (The Congress of Verona met at Verona on 20 October 1822 as part of the series of international conferences or congresses that opened with the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, which had instituted the Concert of Europe at the close of the Napoleonic Wars), horrifying his passenger, a good twenty-five years younger than himself, by the speed at which they hurdled down the narrow country lanes followed by George Gleig who soon lost sight of them. On their return Gleig apologised for the fact that the Duke had left him so far behind. ‚ÄúI thought more than once,‚Äù Clanwilliam said, ‚Äúthat he would have left me behind too!‚Äù In 1847 he was awarded the honorary position of Captain of Deal Castle, which he held until his death. Family Lord Clanwilliam married Lady Elizabeth Herbert, daughter of George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke, on 5 July 1830. He died in 1879 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard. His second son, Sir Robert Henry Meade, later achieved distinction as Permanent Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office.

The Mississippi Mass Choir Musical career After wrestling with the idea of forming a mass choir, Frank Williams, a member of The Jackson Southernaires and an executive in the gospel music division of Malaco Records, decided to form The Mississippi Mass Choir. First, he got the record company's support. Then, he began calling on Mississippi talents like David R. Curry Jr., who became the choir's music director. Having the foundation laid, open auditions were held and more than 100 voices from across the state came together to form The Mississippi Mass Choir. After months of rehearsals, the choir recorded their first album and video The Mississippi Mass Choir live on October 29, 1988. In the spring of 1989, five weeks after their debut album was released, Billboard magazine certified it as the Number 1 Spiritual album in the country. The album stayed on the Billboard charts for a consecutive 45 weeks, setting a new record for gospel recordings. At the 9th annual James Cleveland GMWA Awards, the Mississippi Mass won the Choir of the Year- Contemporary, and Best New Artist of the Year-Traditional. They also walked away with four Stellar Awards in 1989 and were nominated in several categories for the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards and Dove Awards. The choir's next project, God Gets The Glory, in 1990, debuted on the Billboard chart in the Number 16 position, reaching Number 1 position two weeks later. Awards followed with the release of the album. One of the most treasured albums released by the choir was the one in January 1993; It Remains To Be Seen. It maintained the Number 1 position for twelve months. The special part of the album is that it contains the last recorded performance of the choir's founder, Frank Williams, who died on March 22, 1993. Three albums were released since Williams' death, I'll See You in Rapture, Praise the Lord, and Emmanuel (God With Us). Jerry Mannery, Executive Director of the choir, states, ‚ÄúWe are all about our Father‚Äôs business. We are not entertainers, we are ministers for Christ. Our mission remains constant; to serve the Lord and spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ.‚Äù The choir has ministered in song in over 40 states within the US, including Alaska. They have traveled to Japan, Italy, Spain, Bahamas, and Greece; becoming the first gospel group to perform at the Acropolis. While attending the Umbria Jazz Gospel and Soul Easter Festival in Terni, Italy, the choir was invited to sing for Pope John Paul II at his summer residence. The Mississippi Mass Choir recorded their ninth album and live recording for their 20th Anniversary on June 19, 2009 before 4500 people at the First Baptist Church Jackson The Mississippi Mass Choir released their ninth live album, Then Sings My Soul, on February 1, 2011. In 2009 The Mississippi Mass Choir celebrated its 20th anniversary with the release of The First Twenty Years, a compilation DVD and CD of songs recorded over the years, and interviews with choir members. On December 8‚Äì26, 2010, the choir made a fourteen city tour of Spain and the Canary Islands. According to concert promoter Luis Manjarres, ‚ÄúSince their first Spanish tour, Mississippi Mass Choir has become a classic of the European and the Spanish Christmas. They will showcase their talent in the main venues of Barcelona, Madrid, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Pamplona, Gijon, and Vigo. This tour of fourteen concerts will culminate on Christmas night, in the wonderful city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife at the Canary Islands, in a very special event with the 92 piece Tenerife Symphonic Orchestra, under the direction of Maestro Lu Jia. Mississippi Mass Choir will be the first African American choir to perform with a European Symphonic Orchestra before an audience of 20,000. It is the time for Mississippi Mass Choir‚Ä¶It is the time for Classic Gospel.‚Äù In October 2013, The Mississippi Mass Choir commemorate their 25th anniversary by recording their 10th \\"LIVE\\" album in front of a sold out crown in Jackson, MS. On April 11, 2014, the choir released their new single \\"God's On Your Side\\" featuring Sunday Best Winner Le'Andria Johnson and Stan Jones. The album was released in June 2014. The choir the begin a 10 city tour and 13 cities Spain tour. The Stellar Award-winning Mississippi Mass Choir is slated to join the ICAN Foundation in South Africa for the 2011 National Youth Day Celebration. The choir will present various concerts around the country during their visit. This tour will be the choir's first visit to the African continent. On Wednesday January 11, 2017, the choir was featured on an episode of ABC's Show Black.ish. On Sunday October 7, 2018 The award-winning Mississippi Mass Choir appeared on Discovery Channel's #1 series ‚ÄúExpedition Unknown.‚Äù The episode entitled ‚ÄúSearch For The Afterlife ‚Äì Heaven and Hell,‚Äù explores religions and cultures from around the world.

It contains a single species, G. stipanicicorum, which is placed in the clade Suchia, close to the ancestry of crocodylomorphs. Both the genus and the species were first described by Alfred Romer in 1972. Discovery =Discovery of the holotype= A four-month expedition spanning 1964 and 1965 in the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni√≥n Basin of La Rioja Province, Argentina was conducted by Alfred Romer and his colleagues, who consisted of researchers from the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) at Harvard University. While the first two months of the expedition were unfruitful, excavations near the Cha√±ares River and the Gualo River, soon uncovered specimens belonging to a wide variety of tetrapod groups. Among these was the skeleton of a small suchian archosaur, discovered about north of the Cha√±ares River. The skeleton was stored at the La Plata Museum (MLP), which had supported the expedition, under the specimen number MLP 64-XI-14-11. The specimen has since been transferred to the Museum of Paleontology at the National University of La Rioja (PULR), where it bears the specimen number PULR 08. This specimen, which would become the holotype of Gracilisuchus, consists of a partial skull, an incomplete vertebral column, parts of the scapula and humerus, gastralia, and several associated osteoderms. Several other specimens are mixed in with these remains on the same slab. A vertebral series (\\"Series A\\"), originally identified as the tail of Gracilisuchus, has been reassigned to Tropidosuchus. Another series of cervical vertebrae (\\"Series B\\") underwent a similar reassignment. A scapula and coracoid overlapping the holotype's limb bones likely belongs to a second Gracilisuchus. There are three ilia, none of which belong to the holotype; one belongs to a specimen of Lagosuchus, another to Tropidosuchus. A right hindlimb and a left femur and tibia have been assigned to Tropidosuchus, and another one has been assigned to Lagosuchus. The right hindlimb's foot was originally assigned to Gracilisuchus. =Additional specimens and description= Gracilisuchus as restored by Romer in 1972 Three other specimens, stored at the MCZ, were found by Romer and his team in the same locality as the holotype. They are MCZ 1147, a nearly complete skull with jaws; MCZ 4118, parts of the skull, a well-preserved neck, and other elements; and MCZ 4116, a crushed skull and jaw with material from the rest of the body, some of it pertaining to a smaller specimen. Jos√© Bonaparte from the Miguel Lillo Institute (PVL) later collected additional material from the site between 1970 and 1972, including two new specimens: PVL 4597, the \\"Tucuman specimen\\", which includes a nearly complete skull and jaws, nearly complete cervical and dorsal vertebrae, partial sacral and caudal vertebrae, the hip girdle, most of the left hindlimb, and part of the hindlimb, which is 20% larger than the holotype; and PVL 4612, a nearly complete skull and jaws. In 1972, Romer described the specimens his team had discovered in the journal Breviora. He named a new genus for the specimens, Gracilisuchus, with the prefix Gracili- referring to \\"the obviously graceful build of the little reptile\\". Furthermore, he placed them in the type and only species G. stipanicicorum, which honors the work of Pedro and Maria Stipanicic in the stratigraphy and paleobotany of the Triassic period. In this paper, Romer also provided a skeletal reconstruction of Gracilisuchus, due to his impression that nearly the entire skeleton was available. However, several elements had been erroneously referred by him. The lack of complete knowledge regarding its anatomy hampered subsequent studies of Gracilisuchus, until papers from Lecuona, Desojo, and Diego Pol in 2011 and 2017 redescribed its remains. The first of these focused on PVL 4597, while the second reviewed all of the known specimens. Description Gracilisuchus was a small member of the Pseudosuchia. The largest skull has a length of slightly over , and the largest femur has a length of roughly . In 1972, Alfred Romer estimated a total length of ; in 2014, Agustinia Lecuona and Julia Desojo estimated a length of for the body excluding the hip and tail. The weight of Gracilisuchus has been estimated at . =Skull= Illustration A number of characteristics of the skull can be used to distinguish Gracilisuchus. Its skull openings are relatively large, with the antorbital fenestra occupying 30-36% of the skull roof's length and the eye socket occupying 35-42% of the skull roof's length. Additionally, the supratemporal fenestra is, uniquely, wider than it is long. Within the eye socket, there is a sclerotic ring, and the ossicles (bony segments) comprising the ring contact but do not overlap each other. Unlike its closest relatives, Turfanosuchus and Yonghesuchus, but convergent upon Tropidosuchus, early theropods, and the Crocodylomorpha, the lacrimal bone is as tall as the eye socket instead of being significantly shorter. Behind the eye socket, the vertical process of the jugal bone is uniquely straight. The backward process of the jugal is located underneath the forward process of the quadratojugal bone, convergent upon Erpetosuchus, Postosuchus, Polonosuchus, and the Crocodylomorpha, unlike Turfanosuchus and Yonghesuchus where they are the other way around. Furthermore, a postfrontal bone is present, with an outer process that is uniquely long and extends over the back of the eye socket. There is also a postparietal bone, which is small and triangular. At the back of the skull, the posttemporal foramen is large relative to the skull's width. Also unlike Turfanosuchus and Yonghesuchus, Gracilisuchus has four teeth in the premaxilla instead of five, like Prestosuchus, Saurosuchus, Fasolasuchus, Batrachotomus, the Rauisuchidae, and the Crocodylomorpha. There is no cutting edge, or carina, at the front of the premaxillary teeth, and they lack serrated denticles on either the front or rear edges. =Vertebrae= There are eight cervical vertebrae. Unlike Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, Fasolasuchus, Saurosuchus, and sphenosuchians, the suture between the centrum and neural arch of the axis (second cervical) bears an unrounded, triangular upward projection. There is a long, narrow longitudinal keel on the bottom of the axis, which is also seen in Riojasuchus, Saurosuchus, the aetosaur Stagonolepis, and phytosaurs. The front border of the neural spine is uniquely high and vertical, while the rear border is concave like Turfanosuchus but unlike Erpetosuchus. Similar to both, the articular process known as the postzygapophysis projects over the back of the centrum, but it is uniquely in the horizontal plane. The remaining cervicals have poorly- developed keels on their bottom surfaces, in contrast to Erpetosuchus, Nundasuchus, aetosaurs, Saurosuchus, and Riojasuchus. The sides of their centra have long depressions, like Turfanosuchus, aetosaurs, Batrachotomus, and Ticinosuchus. In at least the fourth, sixth, and seventh cervicals, there are narrow, rounded \\"tables\\" at the base of the neural spines, like Turfanosuchus and Euparkeria. There are circular depressions at the front of the neural spines, above the neural arches, a trait shared with Turfanosuchus. The postzygapophyses are located at the same level as another set of processes, the prezygapophyses, like Turfanosuchus, Erpetosuchus, and Ornithosuchus. The top margin of the postzygapophyses are convex like Turfanosuchus. There are depressions below the postzygapophyses, which are not seen in any other archosaurs except for Stagonosuchus and Batrachotomus, where they are deeper. Another set of processes known as the parapophyses extend backwards onto longitudinal ridges, like Nundasuchus, Batrachotomus, and Postosuchus. There are sixteen dorsal vertebrae. Like Parringtonia, Nundasuchus, and other archosaurs, the articulating surfaces of their centra are flat. The keels on their bottom surfaces are again very weak, which is unlike Riojasuchus, Erpetosuchus, Parringtonia, and Nundasuchus, but like aetosaurs. There are no \\"tables\\" on the neural spines either, unlike Turfanosuchus, Erpetosuchus, Parringtonia, aetosaurs, Nundasuchus, and Ticinosuchus. Like Turfanosuchus, Parringtonia, and Nundasuchus, the prezygapophyses are located at the same level as the top of the front of some of the centra. Some of the sideways-projecting transverse processes have somewhat deep cavities underneath, like Turfanosuchus, but they are more poorly developed than Nundasuchus, Batrachotomus, or Stagonosuchus. Two sacral vertebrae are known. The transverse processes of the first sacral, which are nearly fused to the ribs, are separated from the neural spines by two pairs of grooves which form an acute angle. The second sacral's neural arch also bears a long depression on its top surface. The appearance of these characteristics are more similar to Turfanosuchus than Nundasuchus. Uniquely, the outer edges of the first pair of sacral ribs are longer than their inner edges. The second pair has a more prominent expansion, also seen in Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, and Saurosuchus. The two pairs did not contact each other, like Euparkeria. There were at least 16 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Their neural spines do not have accessory processes at their front margins, like Turfanosuchus and Euparkeria but unlike other basal archosaurs. They also lack \\"tables\\", unlike Turfanosuchus and Parringtonia. =Limbs= In the shoulder girdle, the end of the scapular blade is widely and asymmetrically expanded, unlike Turfanosuchus, Batrachotomus, and Ticinosuchus, but similar to the crocodylomorph Dromicosuchus. Unlike Turfanosuchus but like Terrestrisuchus and Dibothrosuchus, the articulation with the radius on the humerus is narrower than the one with the ulna. The width of the bottom end of the humerus is 2.5 times that of the shaft, like Batrachotomus (2.5), Ticinosuchus (2.7), Postosuchus (2.4), and Terrestrisuchus (2.4), but smaller than Turfanosuchus (3.75). In the pelvis, the ilium has a weakly expanded frontal process, like Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, Postosuchus, and Caiman. The front of the articulation with the pubis reaches further than the process, like Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, Saurosuchus, Postosuchus, and Lagerpeton. Meanwhile, the rear process is long, like Turfanosuchus and Postosuchus. There is a shelf along the bottom of this process, most similar to those of Terrestrisuchus, Dromicosuchus, and Marasuchus. The sacral ribs articulate at this shelf, unlike Turfanosuchus where the shelf is located above. The acetabulum, or hip socket, of Gracilisuchus was larger than other archosauriforms. Like Turfanosuchus, Marasuchus, Lagerpeton, and other archosaurs, the acetabulum does not bear a perforation, and there is a buttress above the acetabulum for the femur. Unusually, but like Tropidosuchus, Protosuchus, and Orthosuchus, the articulation with the ilium on the pubis is short. There is a small bony tongue projecting downwards from this articulation, which has only been recognized in Postosuchus. There is no prominent surface of the acetabulum on the pubis, nor is there a visible articulation with the ischium; the former is similar to Fasolasuchus and Orthosuchus, and the latter is similar to living crocodilians. An L-shaped lamina is present on the rear surface of the \\"apron\\" of the pubis. The articulation between the two halves of the ischium is characteristically close to the top of the bone, with the separated portion being only 22% the length of the bone; Ornithosuchus may have a similar condition. Roughly the bottom 55% of the femur is bowed, resulting in a sigmoidal shape. The top of the femoral head is expanded towards the midline, with the expansion closely resembling those of Fasolasuchus, Postosuchus, and the phytosaur Parasuchus. There is also a small forward projection like Pseudohesperosuchus. Like Macelognathus and Trialestes, the fourth trochanter, an archosauriform characteristic, is poorly-developed. On the bottom end, the groove separating the articulations with the tibia and fibula is shallow, like Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, Tropidosuchus, Riojasuchus, Marasuchus, and Lagerpeton. Depressions on the rear and outer surfaces are equally poorly-developed, as in Aetosauroides and Marasuchus. The tibia is 90% of the femur's length, like other basal archosaurs, with a straight shaft, like Euparkeria, Aetosauroides, Neoaetosauroides, Fasolasuchus, Postosuchus, and Lagerpeton. The bottom end of the bone is wider than it is long, like Dromicosuchus. There is a bend about a quarter of the way down from the top of the fibula, where the elongate, weakly-developed iliofibular trochanter is located. Euparkeria, Marasuchus, Terrestrisuchus, Dromicosuchus, and Effigia have a similarly poorly-developed trochanter. Like Turfanosuchus and other members of the Crurotarsi, Gracilisuchus has a \\"crocodile-normal\\" ankle joint, with the astragalus and calcaneum being joined with a \\"peg-and-socket\\" joint. Unlike Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, and Marasuchus, the astragalus has a \\"screw-joint\\" articulation with the tibia, with slightly divergent articulating surfaces. Like Turfanosuchus and Euparkeria, the hollow on the front of the astraglus covers more than half of the surface. Unlike those two, the inner face of the astragalus has one flat surface instead of two. The calcaneum has a \\"sliding\\" articulation with the fibula like Turfanosuchus and other pseudosuchians. There is a notch on the back of the bone, like in Turfanosuchus, Aetosauroides, Fasolasuchus, Dromicosuchus, Protosuchus, and Caiman. The tuber beside the notch is directed backwards and is wider than high, like Turfanosuchus and aetosaurs. There are five digits in the foot, with the number of phalanges being preserved on each digit being 2-3-2-2-1 from the first digit to the fifth; the first digit is completely preserved. =Osteoderms= Gracilisuchus bore two rows of bony plates known as osteoderms above its neck and torso, with the first pair beginning immediately behind the skull. They do not appear to continue over the hip; this may be associated with the lack of \\"tables\\" in the neural spines of the rear vertebrae, or it may be an artifact of preservation. Like Turfanosuchus, Ticinosuchus, Saurosuchus, and Qianosuchus, there were two pairs of osteoderms over each vertebra. Each osteoderm slightly overlaps the one immediately behind it, and the left osteoderm of each row is slightly further forward than the right, creating an asymmetrical appearance. This staggered arrangement is also seen in Euparkeria, Ticinosuchus, Nundasuchus, Qianosuchus, Prestosuchus, and Saurosuchus. While osteoderms from the frontmost row are triangular, osteoderms further behind are leaf-shaped. These leaf-shaped osteoderms have small forward projections where they meet each other at the midline, like Turfanosuchus and Euparkeria but unlike Postosuchus, Batrachotomus, and Saurosuchus, which possess osteoderms with forward projections situated further to the sides. The surface of each osteoderm bears a longitudinal midline crest, with a depression on either side. This is similar to Saurosuchus and Batrachotomus, but unlike Turfanosuchus, Euparkeria, Erpetosuchus, Parringtonia, and Postosuchus, which all have crests not on the midline. Different specimens of Gracilisuchus have different osteoderm surface textures; some are smooth like Turfanosuchus, while others bear radial pits and grooves like Erpetosuchus. Classification =Interpretation as an ornithosuchid= Romer considered Gracilisuchus to be, \\"quite clear[ly]\\", a relative of the Scottish Ornithosuchus, owing to similarities in skull structure and other skeletal features. When Alick Walker described Ornithosuchus in 1964, he suggested that Teratosaurus and Sinosaurus were its closest relatives, collectively forming the family Ornithosuchidae. He further suggested that they were theropod dinosaurs. At this time, theropods were divided into two groups following Romer's 1956 classification: the Coelurosauria (long-necked, small-headed theropods) and Carnosauria (short- necked, large-headed theropods). Walker considered ornithosuchids to belong to the latter group, due to strong morphological similarities between the limb girdles of Ornithosuchus, Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, and Antrodemus (=Allosaurus). He identified ornithosuchids as the ancestral Triassic stock from which Jurassic and Cretaceous carnosaurs originated. This assessment remained fairly popular in ensuing years, and was adopted by Romer for the 1966 edition of his textbook Vertebrate Paleontology. By the time of Romer's description of Gracilisuchus in 1972, the geographic range of ornithosuchids had expanded to include the Argentinian Venaticosuchus and Riojasuchus, which had been referred to the family by Bonaparte in 1969. Romer noted that Gracilisuchus was the smallest and oldest known member of the group to date, and accordingly had a fairly basal morphology (notwithstanding supposedly aberrant traits such as the partial closure of the infratemporal fenestra). However, he had reservations regarding Walker's identification of ornithosuchids as dinosaurs, noting basal archosaur traits such as the closed acetabulum, osteoderms, and crocodile-normal ankle. Thus, he considered the supposedly carnosaurian features to be products of convergence. =Reidentification as a non-ornithosuchid= Doubts arose in following years regarding whether Gracilisuchus was actually referable to the Ornithosuchidae. In 1979, Arthur Cruickshank separated pseudosuchians (\\"crocodile-line\\" archosaurs) into two groups based on whether they bore \\"crocodile-normal\\" or \\"crocodile-reversed\\" (where the peg and socket are located on the opposite bones) ankles. He observed that, while Gracilisuchus had a \\"crocodile-normal\\" joint, other ornithosuchids had a \\"crocodile-reversed\\" joint; he thus removed Gracilisuchus from the Ornithosuchidae. Donald Brinkman noted in 1981 that, without further information regarding the origin of \\"crocodile-reversed\\" joints, it would be possible that \\"crocodile-normal\\" joints represent the basal condition, which was retained in Gracilisuchus, with \\"crocodile- reversed\\" joints representing a specialization of later ornithosuchids. However, at the same time, Brinkman noted a number of other traits in Gracilisuchus that differ from \\"advanced\\" ornithosuchids. These include the rectangular antorbital fenestra; the rounded bottom of the eye socket due to the absence of a prominent projection of the jugal bone in front of the eye; the tall, slender quadratojugal bone; the lack of a gap between the teeth of the premaxilla and maxilla; the rectangular infratemporal fenestra; a concave flange on the rear of the squamosal bone; the rear of the mandible of the lower jaw being unforked, and extending backwards only above the mandibular fenestra; the splenial bone forming the bottom of the jaw as opposed to being restricted to its inner surface; the lack of keels in the cervical vertebrae; and the presence of two osteoderm rows over each vertebra instead of one. The first, fourth, and fifth of these are shared with Euparkeria, leading Brinkman to consider them as basal traits; however, Euparkeria is more similar to \\"advanced\\" ornithosuchids with respect to the other traits. According to Brinkman, this left two possibilities: either Gracilisuchus was derived from the basal ornithosuchid condition in a manner different from other ornithosuchids, or it represents a different evolutionary radiation altogether, separate from the ornithosuchids. He noted intriguing similarities between Gracilisuchus and members of the Sphenosuchia; the third and sixth of the above traits are shared with Sphenosuchus and Pseudohesperosuchus, while the ninth is shared with Lewisuchus. Thus, in a phylogenetic tree, Brinkman tentatively depicted Gracilisuchus as being closer to the \\"crocodile-line\\" Erythrosuchidae, the Rauisuchidae, and the Stagonolepididae (=Aetosauria) than the Ornithosuchidae and the Euparkeriidae. =Inclusion in the Suchia and Crurotarsi= Phylogenetic analysis soon supported Brinkman's hypothesis that Gracilisuchus was closer to \\"crocodile-line\\" archosaurs. In 1988, Michael Benton and James Clark published a phylogenetic analysis incorporating Gracilisuchus and 16 other taxa. It was recovered as a member of the Suchia, a group defined by Bernard Krebs as being characterized by a \\"crocodile-normal\\" ankle, among other characteristics. Within the Suchia, they found that Gracilisuchus was the sister taxon of crocodylomorphs and \\"pseudosuchians\\" (which they restrictively defined to include rauisuchids and stagonolepidids). It was differentiated from the latter two by the presence of postparietals and the absence of: a pit between the basioccipital and basisphenoid bones; fusion between the atlas (first cervical) and the intercentrum, an element below the axis; accessory processes on the caudal neural spines; and osteoderms on the bottom of the tail. Meanwhile, ornithosuchids were closer to dinosaurs in the Ornithosuchia, and Euparkeria was the sister taxon of the group containing suchians and ornithosuchians. In 1990, Paul Sereno and Andrea Arcucci suggested that ornithosuchids - in which they included Gracilisuchus - were actually closer to the conventional \\"crocodile-line\\" archosaurs than dinosaurs. They named the collective group of Suchia, Ornithosuchidae, and Parasuchia (=Phytosauria) as the Crurotarsi, and noted some uniting characteristics: the strong inward arch of the top of the humerus; the bottom end of the fibula being wider than the top; the specialized \\"sliding\\" articulation between the fibula and calcaneum; the \\"screw-joint\\" articulation between the tibia and astragalus; the robust tuber of the calcaneum, with a flared bottom end; and a \\"recess\\" at the back of the top end of the pubis. Gracilisuchus was identified as an exception for additional uniting traits, such as the robust trochanter on the fibula and the single row of osteoderms per vertebra. This classification was further revised by Sereno in 1991, when he removed Gracilisuchus from the ornithosuchids, and used it to define Suchia's contents. =Phylogenetic \\"limbo\\"= Subsequent analyses did not reach a consensus on the relationships between Gracilisuchus and other crurotarsans. Despite this ambiguity, Gracilisuchus has been widely used as the staple outgroup, or taxon representing a basal condition, in analyses of more derived pseudosuchians such as crocodylomorphs, including both crocodyliforms and sphenosuchians (now known to be a paraphyletic assemblage of non-crocodyliform crocodylomorphs). J. Michael Parrish's 1993 analysis noted that a \\"splint-like\\" fifth metatarsal in the foot, likely a consequence of the compaction of the foot, united Gracilisuchus with its sister group, the newly-defined Paracrocodylomorpha (Poposauridae and Crocodylomorpha). They formed the Rauisuchia along with the Rauisuchidae. However, Parrish also noted that Gracilisuchus differed from other rauisuchians in the absence of an ossification at the back of the top of the skull, and the absence of a fenestra between the premaxilla and maxilla. In a 1994 analysis, Lars Juul moved Gracilisuchus inside the Paracrocodylomorpha, placing it as the sister taxon of Postosuchus (then a poposaurid). Paracrocodylomorpha, in turn, was united with the Ornithosuchidae to form the Dromaeosuchia. Both analyses suggested that the squamosal flange of Gracilisuchus was homologous with that of Postosuchus and crocodylomorphs. Descriptions of material from Erpetosuchus in the early 2000s were accompanied by further analyses incorporating Gracilisuchus. In a 2000 description of North American material, Paul Olsen, Hans-Dieter Sues, and Mark Norell recovered Gracilisuchus as more derived than Stagonolepis but more basal than Postosuchus, Erpetosuchus, and crocodylomorphs. Later, in a 2002 revision of the genus, Benton and Walker found contrasting hypotheses for the position of Gracilisuchus: as being more derived than a group containing Ornithosuchus and rauisuchians (Saurosuchus, Batrachotomus, Prestosuchus); or being in a polytomy with Ornithosuchus and rauisuchians. In both cases, it was more basal than the same group in Olsen and colleagues' analysis, being united by a ridge on the squamosal bone above the supratemporal fenestra and the absence of a foramen on the quadrate. In an analysis for the 2004 second edition of The Dinosauria, Benton performed another phylogenetic analysis, finding Gracilisuchus to be the sister taxon of the Phytosauria (by then renamed from the Parasuchia). They formed a polytomy with Ornithosuchidae, which was in a basal position relative to the Suchia (defined to include Stagonolepididae, Postosuchus, and Crocodylomorpha), Fasolasuchus, and the Prestosuchidae. Later, in 2006, the same relationship with the Phytosauria was recovered by Chun Li and colleagues in a phylogenetic analysis conducted for the supplementary material of the description of Qianosuchus. They found that group to be in a polytomy with Ornithosuchidae; Qianosuchus; the group of Postosuchus and Crocodylomorpha; and the group of Stagonolepididae, Fasolasuchus, and Prestosuchidae. Stephen Brusatte, Benton, Desojo, and Max Langer conducted the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis at the time in 2010. They noted Gracilisuchus had been a \\"singleton\\" taxon in prior analyses, one that couldn't be definitely placed in any particular group. In their own analysis, Gracilisuchus was the sister taxon of a group containing Erpetosuchus and the Crocodylomorpha, which along with the Aetosauria (by then renamed from the Stagonolepididae) formed one branch of the Suchia. Although they found strong support for this grouping in the form of eight synapomorphies (shared traits), with two of them (involving the ossification and position of the perilymphatic foramen of the braincase) being unambiguous, later assessment noted that this may have resulted from poor non- rauisuchian sampling. Meanwhile, Revueltosaurus and ornithosuchids formed a group on the opposite branch of the Suchia, being closer to rauisuchians. In 2011, Sterling Nesbitt conducted another, better-sampled phylogenetic analysis. Contrary to Parrish and Juul, he found that Gracilisuchus acquired a squamosal flange independently of Postosuchus and crocodylomorphs. Although he recovered a variety of positions for Gracilisuchus in different trees, all of them agreed that Gracilisuchus was a basal suchian, and was closer to crocodylomorphs than the non-archosaurian phytosaurs. The consensus found Gracilisuchus to be in a polytomy with a group of Revueltosaurus and Aetosauria; Turfanosuchus; and a group of Ticinosaurus and Paracrocodylomorpha. He noted that the removal of Turfanosuchus allied Gracilisuchus with ornithosuchids in one possible tree, with this relationship being based upon unambiguous synapomorphies such as the presence of three premaxillary teeth; the length of the pubis being more than 70% that of the femur; the pubis being longer than the ischium; the presence of a midline gap at the bottom of the ischium; and the lack of a \\"hook\\" at the top end of the fifth metatarsal. =Formation of the Gracilisuchidae= The redescription of the hindlimbs of Gracilisuchus by Lecuona and Desojo in 2011 allowed additional data to be incorporated into subsequent analyses. Lecuona and Desojo also noted that the poor development of the fourth trochanter and femoral head was shared with members of the Sphenosuchia, which allowed for the possibility that they formed a monophyletic group. However, they also noted that Nesbitt's analysis provides support for a position outside the Crocodylomorpha, due to the absence of a perforated acetabulum. In 2014, an analysis led by Richard Butler, modified from that of Nesbitt, suggested for the first time that Gracilisuchus formed a group with Turfanosuchus and Yonghesuchus, two basal suchians with similarly convoluted taxonomic histories. The group was named the Gracilisuchidae. They found that Gracilisuchidae was the sister taxon of a group containing Ticinosuchus and the Paracrocodylomorpha, with all of these collectively forming the sister taxon to a group consisting of Revueltosaurus and the Aetosauria; both sub- groups had previously been recovered by Nesbitt. Strong support was obtained for the Gracilisuchidae in the form of six unambiguous synapomorphies: a process on the back of the premaxilla that fits into a slot on outer surface of the nasal bone; the nasal bordering the top of the antorbital fenestra; the tapering frontal bone; the presence of a depression on the bottom of the calcaneal tuber; the osteoderms bending downwards at their outer edges; and the presence of a triangular process bearing a clear apex on the maxilla. Within the Gracilisuchidae, Butler and colleagues noted that Gracilisuchus was likely closer to Yonghesuchus than Turfanosuchus, on account of three synapomorphies: the contact between the squamosal and postorbital bones continuing backwards along much of the former's bottom surface; the jugal stopping short at its rear end of the infratemporal fenestra; and the conjunction of the basisphenoid and parasphenoid being located between plate- like, triangular projections of the basioccipital known as tubera, with the basipterygoid processes at the base of the basisphenoid being at least 1.5 times longer than it is wide. However, poor support for this relationship was obtained, partially due to the incompleteness of material referred to Yonghesuchus. Lecuona, Desojo, and Pol conducted another analysis, building upon the work of Butler and colleagues as well as Lecuona's 2013 thesis, in 2017 to accompany their redescription of Gracilisuchus. They uncovered the same phylogenetic arrangements within the Gracilisuchidae and in relation to other pseudosuchians. However, their analysis was able to provide a well- resolved tree even with the inclusion of the erpetosuchids (Erpetosuchus and Parringtonia); the inclusion of erpetosuchids had collapsed Gracilisuchidae into a polytomy in Butler and colleagues' analysis. Lecuona and colleagues added two synapomorphies of Gracilisuchidae to those listed by Butler: the absence of the jugal's contribution to the postorbital bar behind the eye socket, and the articulations with the fibula and astragalus forming a continuous structure on the calcaneum. They also removed the original character involving the calcaneal tuber. Finally, they added one synapomorphy uniting Gracilisuchus and Yonghesuchus: the absence of the postorbital's contribution to the border of the infratemporal fenestra. Palaeobiology =Posture= Owing to its supposed affinities with Ornithosuchus, Romer reconstructed Gracilisuchus as a facultative biped in his initial description. Both Walker and Bonaparte noted that the forelimbs of ornithosuchids were considerably reduced relative to the hindlimbs, with likewise reduced fingers that were more suitable for grasping than locomotion. Although the hand is not preserved in Gracilisuchus, Romer noted that its forelimbs were three-fifths the lengths of the hindlimbs, like ornithosuchids; however, this interpretation was based on material which has since been reassigned. Palaeoecology =Stratigraphic context= The locality where Gracilisuchus was discovered is known as the Los Cha√±ares locality, and is located at . It consists of badlands at the base of a latitudinal escarpment, with the exposed rocks being composed of feldspar and quartz grains, along with glass shards, embedded in a geology silica and clay. These rocks belong to the lower portion of the Cha√±ares Formation, which locally overlies the Tarjados Formation and underlies the Los Rastros Formation. Starting about above the boundary between the Tarjados and Cha√±ares Formations, brown concretions of carbonate are present throughout the rock. It is in these concretions that the remains of Gracilisuchus and other tetrapods have been found. Unlike other Carnian (Late Triassic) formations, there are no dinosaur remains in the Cha√±ares Formation. This has led researchers to assign a Middle Triassic age to the Cha√±ares. Owing to shared faunal components, correlations with the Dinodontosaurus Assemblage Zone of the Santa Mar√≠a Formation in Brazil have been used to assign a Ladinian age to the Cha√±ares. Argon-argon dating of the Ischigualasto Formation (which locally overlies the Los Rastros) in 1993 also produced an age near the Ladinian-Carnian boundary, thus constraining the Cha√±ares to the Ladinian. However, more accurate uranium-lead dating subsequently necessitated revisions of the geological time scale. The Ischigualasto was reassigned to the late Carnian, making a Carnian age possible for the Cha√±ares. This was reaffirmed by uranium-lead dating of Cha√±ares deposits in 2016, indicating an early Carnian age of 236 to 234 million years.

Her first book, Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust (2006), is an autobiographical work detailing how she survived during the Rwandan genocide. She was featured on one of Wayne Dyer's PBS programs, and also on a December 3, 2006 segment of 60 Minutes (which re-aired on July 1, 2007). In Left to Tell, Immacul√©e Ilibagiza shares of her experience during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. She survived hidden for 91 days with seven other women in a small bathroom, no larger than 3 feet (0.91 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m) (an area of 12 square feet). The bathroom was concealed in a room behind a wardrobe in the home of a Hutu pastor. During the genocide, most of Ilibagiza's family (her mother, her father, and her two brothers Damascene and Vianney) was killed by Hutu Interahamwe soldiers. Besides herself, the only other survivor in her family was her brother Aimable, who was studying out of the country in Senegal and did not know of the genocide. Ilibagiza shares how her Catholic faith guided her through her ordeal and describes her eventual forgiveness and compassion toward her family's killers. Immacul√©e Ilibagiza's second book, Led by Faith: Rising from the ashes of the Rwandan Holocaust (2008), picks up where she left off in Left to Tell. She tells her story of survival immediately following the genocide she had lived through. It describes how her faith in God kept her going as she struggled to find her place in the world again, and it also shows how she sought out and encouraged many of the orphans who were equally lost. She finally finds a safe refuge in the United States where she is able to look back at everything she had been through. It is in this safe place where she has the potential to reflect on why she lived through the experience at all. In 2006, a documentary short about her story, The Diary of Immacul√©e, was released by Academy Award‚Äìnominated documentarians Peter LeDonne and Steve Kalafer. Ilibagiza speaks all over the world and is the recipient of the 2007 Mahatma Gandhi Reconciliation and Peace Award. In 2012 she was the June 9 speaker for the Robert E. and Bonnie Cone Hooper Plenary Address of the Christian Scholars Conference at Lipscomb University. In 2013, Ilibagiza became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She studied electrical and mechanical engineering at the National University of Rwanda and received honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame in 2007 and St. John's University in 2008.

This instrument was normally built in C and the pedal (lowest) note of the majority of tenor cornetts was the C below middle C. A number of surviving instruments feature a key to secure the lowest note. The instrument has a useful range of approximately two and a half octaves, however, an experienced player with a strong embouchure may be able to push the instrument higher. The tenor cornett was used by composers like Giovanni Gabrieli, Heinrich Sch√ºtz and Orlando di Lasso as an alto or tenor voice in an ensemble of cornetts and trombones. Like most specimens of treble cornetts, tenor cornetts were usually pitched in ' or Cornettton, ca. a' = 466 Hz ‚Äì around a semi-tone higher than modern concert pitch, which is a' = 440 Hz. Nomenclature The tenor cornett was also known as the lyzard, lizarden, lysarden or lyzarden, because of the \\"S\\" shape of the instrument. The instrument was also known as the cornetto tenore, cornetto grosso, cornetto storto or cornone, in Italian, and Corno, Tenor-Zink or Gro√ü Tenor-Zink in German. In a number of works from the late 16th and early 17th centuries there are parts for tenor cornetts which feature only the word \\"cornetto\\" or \\"cornetto √¥ trombon\\" above or next to the part. We know that such parts are intended for the tenor cornett because the tessitura of the musical line and the fact that the tenor clef is used. For example, see: Canzon in echo duodecimi toni √† 10 by Giovanni Gabrieli and Ist nicht Ephraim mein teurer Sohn SWV 40 (from the Psalmen Davids of 1619) by Heinrich Sch√ºtz. Both of these works feature low cornetto lines written in the tenor clef. Tessitura The tessitura of the tenor cornett is c to around e\\". However, an experienced player with a powerful embouchure and a small bore instrument may reach g\\" or higher. Timbre The timbre or sound quality of the tenor cornett is somewhat horn-like with an agreeable woodwind character. In the hands of an experienced player, the tenor cornett has a smooth sound, which is an ideal link between the sound of the higher cornetti and the lower trombones. The sound has been described as \\"foggy\\". The instrument blends extremely well with male voices, particularly those of countertenors. Michael Praetorius was not enthusiastic about the sound of the tenor cornett; he describes it as \\"bullocky and horn-like\\" in his Syntagma Musicum of 1619. He suggests that a trombone is to be preferred and the alto and tenor voices of cornett and trombone ensembles was usually played on trombones. However, tenor cornetts seem to have been common enough and composers like Gabrieli, Lassus, Hassler and Sch√ºtz (the fourth cornetto part of the Psalmen Davids of 1619 requires a tenor cornett) frequently made use of this instrument. Christopher Monk speculates that Praetorius heard the instrument played rather badly on several occasions. The In Dulci Jubilo √† 20 cum Tubis setting by Praetorius from his Polyhymnia Caduceatrix & Panegyrica of 1619, seems to require a tenor cornett on the third line of Choro I, the part is scored for a viola (alto) and a cornett playing together. The 1619 Polyhymnia and, indeed, other collections by Praetorius, contain works with parts plausibly intended for tenor cornetts. The tenor cornett has a powerful forte, yet its piano is soft enough to render it a suitable substitute for the C bass in a recorder consort. Cornettists Douglas Kirk and Nicholas Perry play tenor cornetts in the 1991 recording Giovanni Gabrieli: Canzonas, Sonatas & Motets by the Taverner Consort, Choir & Players, directed by Andrew Parrott. Originally on EMI (CDC 7 54265 2), this recording is now available on the Virgin label. Roland Wilson and his group Musica Fiata employ tenor cornetts in their recordings of the Psalmen Davids of Heinrich Sch√ºtz and the Feast of San Rocco recording of music by Giovanni Gabrieli and his contemporaries. Both recordings are available on the Sony label. Variants Tenor cornetts seem to have come in two varieties ‚Äì small bore and large bore. The smaller bored instruments seem to have been \\"scaled up\\" cornetts, true alto or tenor cornetts. However, a number of instruments with a larger bore have survived and these instruments seem to have had a sound somewhat reminiscent of the serpent. The timbre of the small bore tenor cornetti is more \\"focused\\" and incisive than that of their large bore counterparts. Some modern cornett makers, like Christopher Monk, for instance, have made both varieties of tenor cornett available to customers. Usage The tenor cornett was used almost exclusively as a consort instrument. No solo music survives for this instrument. In the works of Sch√ºtz, Schein, Scheidt, Praetorius, Gabrieli, Viadana and other composers from 16th and 17th century Venice, the tenor cornett appears to have been employed as the 3rd or 4th voice in instrumental and vocal music, usually playing alto or tenor ranged musical parts. Works which employ three or more cornetts in a single \\"choir\\" frequently require the use of a tenor cornett on the lowest line specified for the cornetts. Orlande de Lassus employed the tenor cornett in various broken consort combinations of instruments in performances under his direction at the Munich court. Trojano, a singer at the Munich court, lists the instrumentations of a number of works under the direction of Lassus in 1569. One work included: eight viols, eight viole da braccio (violins, violas, cellos, etc.), eight mixed wind; fagotto, corna-musa, mute cornett, cornett, tenor cornett, flute, dolzaina and a bass trombone. It was also a popular instrument with Renaissance Waits. Walther's Fugen, 1542, marked \\"especially for cornetts\\", needs a tenor on the lowest line.

Thus, to establish a lower bound on the performance of randomized algorithms, it suffices to find an appropriate distribution of difficult inputs, and to prove that no deterministic algorithm can perform well against that distribution. This principle is named after Andrew Yao, who first proposed it. Yao's principle may be interpreted in game theoretic terms, via a two-player zero-sum game in which one player, Alice, selects a deterministic algorithm, the other player, Bob, selects an input, and the payoff is the cost of the selected algorithm on the selected input. Any randomized algorithm R may be interpreted as a randomized choice among deterministic algorithms, and thus as a strategy for Alice. By von Neumann's minimax theorem, Bob has a randomized strategy that performs at least as well against R as it does against the best pure strategy Alice might choose; that is, Bob's strategy defines a distribution on the inputs such that the expected cost of R on that distribution (and therefore also the worst case expected cost of R) is no better than the expected cost of any single deterministic algorithm against the same distribution. Statement The formulation below states the principle for Las Vegas randomized algorithms, i.e., distributions over deterministic algorithms that are correct on every input but have varying costs. It is straightforward to adapt the principle to Monte Carlo algorithms, i.e., distributions over deterministic algorithms that have bounded costs but can be incorrect on some inputs. Consider a problem over the inputs \\\\mathcal{X}, and let \\\\mathcal{A} be the set of all possible deterministic algorithms that correctly solve the problem. For any algorithm a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} and input x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, let c(a, x) \\\\geq 0 be the cost of algorithm a run on input x. Let p be a probability distribution over the algorithms \\\\mathcal{A}, and let A denote a random algorithm chosen according to p. Let q be a probability distribution over the inputs \\\\mathcal{X}, and let X denote a random input chosen according to q. Then, : \\\\underset{x\\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}}{\\\\max}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{E}[c(A,x)] \\\\geq \\\\underset{a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}}{\\\\min}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{E}[c(a,X)]. That is, the worst- case expected cost of the randomized algorithm is at least the cost of the best deterministic algorithm against input distribution q. Proof Let C = \\\\underset{x\\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}}{\\\\max}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{E}[c(A,x)] and D = \\\\underset{a\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}}{\\\\min}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{E}[c(a,X)].

History  Laid out by General Jefferson C. Davis, at some point between 1868 and 1870 during his time as the first commander of the Department of Alaska, as a place to inter military personnel who died while serving at the local Marine base or were under care at the Naval hospital. In 1912, the military withdrew from the area and the cemetery was neglected until 1921 when the Sitka American Legion petitioned the Secretary of the Navy for an allocation of funds to maintain the site. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge gave an executive order declaring the site a National Cemetery, and the maintenance responsibility was turned over to the United States Department of War. A 1925 revision of the executive order reduced the area of the site, but donations of land in 1957, 1959, and in the mid 1980s made it larger than it was originally. The cemetery was enlisted as a historic district in the National Register of Historical Places in 2012.

The type specimen is ANSP 15072\\\\. It was discovered by Bock's four-year-old son. It was not a large animal; the type skeleton was estimated by Bock as long, and its thigh bone was only 23 millimeters long (0.91 in). Friedrich von Huene assigned the animal to Protorosauria in 1948 as the smallest known member of the group, finding it to be most like Macrocnemus. Steel (1970) classified it as a theropod dinosaur, whereas Olsen and Baird (1986) identified it as a chimera of mixed remains from a coelacanth and possibly the tanystropheid Tanytrachelos; Olsen and Flynn (1989) later modified this interpretation, describing the type specimen of Gwyneddosaurus as a \\"gastric ejection\\" (regurgitation) composed of Tanytrachelos bones and possibly scraps of a coelacanth. They noted that this would make Gwyneddosaurus a senior synonym of Tanytrachelos, and recommended conserving the younger but better-represented genus.

Cornettini usually featured a primary scale of C or D major, with middle C or the adjacent D the pedal note of the instrument. The regular cornett was the 'treble' instrument of the family. Cornettino  Construction  Like the cornetto, the cornettino was made from two pieces of wood, carved out and glued together. The instrument was covered in leather or parchment to prevent leaks and improve the grip for the player. Some instruments were made from ivory and these instruments were, accordingly, not covered in leather. The mouthpieces were made from animal horn, bone or ivory. Some instruments featured metal mountings at one or both ends of the instrument. These mountings help prevent the fraying of the leather or parchment and were decorative. Silver and gold were used for these mountings.  History  Cornettini were common in the high Renaissance and the Baroque musical periods. Cornettini were featured extensively in Northern European music and almost ignored entirely by Southern European composers, except those who migrated north. In the time of Michael Praetorius, the cornettino seems to have sometimes been used in sacred vocal music to play in unison with voices (esp. tenors) an octave higher. Later in the 17th century, Northern European composers frequently used cornettini in large scale Masses, cantatas and other sacred music. The cornettino was favoured by the Stadtpfeiffen and composers like Johann Caspar Horn and Matthias Spiegler wrote a significant quantity of consort music featuring the one to three cornettini. It appears that the cornettino continued to be used, primarily in church music and in Stadtpfeiffer bands, in some places in Europe until the late 18th century. Georg Philipp Telemann and Johann Sebastian Bach used the cornettino in several church cantatas.  Tessitura  The tessitura or compass/range of the cornettino is c' to around g\\"'. A player with a strong embouchure may be able to coax higher notes from this instrument.  Pitch  Almost all surviving specimens of this instrument are pitched circa a' = 466 Hz or higher. Like organs, cornetts and trombones, the cornettino was regarded as primarily an ecclesiastical instrument and hence was constructed in Chor-ton or Kornett-ton pitch.  Timbre  The timbre of the cornettino is more pungent, brighter and a little more incisive than that of the regular cornetto. Cornettini were frequently used in large consorts and orchestras in the company of trumpets and high violin parts. The timbre of the instrument seems to have been regarded by 17th century Northern European composers as very agreeable juxtaposed the natural trumpets of the time which featured a conical bell and a much more \\"oboe-like\\" sound and the violins pitched at a' = 466 Hz. The second and third octaves of the cornettino can be made to sound piercing. The primary/fundamental octave has an agreeable \\"reedy\\" quality, which is reminiscent of the later oboe.  Variants  A small number (three: one in Nuremberg; two in Vienna) of mute cornettini (id est descant mute cornetti) have survived and these instruments are straight, like their treble and alto counterparts, with an integral mouthpiece. No extant music for the mute cornettino has yet come to light and the function of this instrument remains obscure. The surviving score of the large scale madrigal, Udite chiari e generosi figli √† 16 voci, by Giovanni Gabrieli, requires a cornetto muto on the cantus line of Choro I. Since this part requires the instrument to play up to a\\", a mute cornettino may have been intended by the composer - certainly this part would be readily playable on such an instrument, although, the tessitura of the part is well within the compass of a regular mute cornett in G or F.  Repertoire  Some composers who specified the use of the cornettino in their scores include: Michael Praetorius, Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Johann Heinrich Schmelzer, Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber, Matthias Weckmann, Antonio Bertali, Johann Caspar Horn, Johann Erasmus Kindermann, Matthias Spiegler, Johann Vierdanck, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann.

Works by Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber and Andreas Hofer specify the cornetto in a number of sacred compositions, but one may presume that such parts were intended to be played on cornettini on account of the tessitura of such parts. The Missa Salisburgensis √† 53 voci is an example.  Nomenclature  The cornettino was also known as: Cornettin [Cornettinen], Kornettin, Quart-Zink, Klein Discant Zink, Klein Diskant Zink, Diskant Zink, Krummer Diskant Zink and cor√±io (as in Bach's chorale cantata Christum wir sollen loben schon, BWV 121).

Van Gorkom 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985) is a United States corporate law case of the Delaware Supreme Court, discussing a director's duty of care. It is often called the \\"Trans Union case\\". Van Gorkom is sometimes referred to as the most important case regarding business organizations because it shows a unique scenario when the board is found liable even after applying the business judgment rule.Jarrod Shobe, BYU Law, Lecture on Business Judgement Rule (Oct 2017). The decision \\"stripped corporate directors and officers of the protective cloak formerly provided by the business judgment rule, rendering them liable for the tort of gross negligence for the violation of their duties under the rule.\\" Facts The case involved a proposed leveraged buy-out merger of TransUnion by Marmon Group which was controlled by Jay Pritzker.Ribstein, L. E., & Letsou, P. V. (2003). Business associations. Analysis and skills series. [New York, N.Y.]: M. Bender. Defendant Jerome W. Van Gorkom, who was the TransUnion's chairman and CEO, chose a proposed price of $55 without consultation with outside financial experts. He only consulted with the company's CFO, and that consultation was to determine a per share price that would work for a leveraged buyout. Van Gorkom and the CFO did not determine an actual total value of the company. The board approved the sale of TransUnion because it suffered accelerated depreciation and a reduced income; in other words, it had more tax credits than income. The court was highly critical of this decision, writing that \\"the record is devoid of any competent evidence that $55 represented the per share intrinsic value of the Company.\\" The proposed merger was subject to Board approval. At the Board meeting, a number of items were not disclosed, including the problematic methodology that Van Gorkom used to arrive at the proposed price. Also, previous objections by management were not discussed. The Board approved the proposal. Judgment = Majority = The Court found that the directors were grossly negligent, because they quickly approved the merger without substantial inquiry or any expert advice. For this reason, the board of directors breached the duty of care that it owed to the corporation's shareholders. As such, the protection of the business judgment rule was unavailable. The Court stated, > The rule itself \\"is a presumption that in making a business decision, the > directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in > the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the > company.\\" ... Thus, the party attacking a board decision as uninformed must > rebut the presumption that its business judgment was an informed one. 488 A.2d at 872. Furthermore, the court rejected defendant's argument that the substantial premium paid over the market price indicated that it was a good deal. In so doing, the court noted the irony that the board stated that the decision to accept the offer was based on their expertise, while at the same time asserting that it was proper because the price offered was a large premium above market value. The decision also clarified the directors' duty of disclosure, stating that corporate directors must disclose all facts germane to a transaction that is subject to a shareholder vote. = Dissent = Justices McNeilly and Christie wrote dissenting opinions. McNeilly hotly dissented, calling the majority's opinion a \\"comedy of errors,\\" and saying it \\"reads like an advocate's closing address to a hostile jury. And I say that not lightly.\\" Particularly, McNeilly argues the facts show the board made an informed decision: > I have no quarrel with the majority's analysis of the business judgment > rule. It is the application of that rule to these facts which is wrong. An > overview of the entire record, rather than the limited view of bits and > pieces which the majority has exploded like popcorn, convinces me that the > directors made an informed business judgment which was buttressed by their > test of the market. Christie also argues the business judgment rule protects the board in this case. Significance The case prompted an outcry from boards of directors of public companies, a sharp increase in insurance premiums for directors and officers' insurance, and the eventual adoption by the Delaware legislature of Delaware General Corporation Law ¬ß102(b)(7) as extracted below. This permits Delaware companies (with shareholder approval) to adopt charter amendments that exculpate directors from personal liability for breaches of the duty of care. > (7) A provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director > to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of > fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not > eliminate or limit the liability of a director: (i) For any breach of the > director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for > acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct > or a knowing violation of law; (iii) under ¬ß 174 of this title; or (iv) for > any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal > benefit. No such provision shall eliminate or limit the liability of a > director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such > provision becomes effective. All references in this paragraph to a director > shall also be deemed to refer (x) to a member of the governing body of a > corporation which is not authorized to issue capital stock, and (y) to such > other person or persons, if any, who, pursuant to a provision of the > certificate of incorporation in accordance with ¬ß 141(a) of this title, > exercise or perform any of the powers or duties otherwise conferred or > imposed upon the board of directors by this title. The vast majority of Delaware corporations now have a 102(b)(7) provision in their certificate of incorporation.In re Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, 907 A.2d 693, 752 (Del. Ch. 2005) Nevertheless, the case lives on as a reminder that directors should take reasonable actions to inform themselves before acting. After the court's decision to remand the case back to the Court of Chancery the defendants agreed to a settlement. The directors agreed to pay $23.5 million in damages, of which $10 million was covered by insurance with Pritzker then paying the remainder of the settlement even though he was not a party to the lawsuit. Pritzker paid as he did not agree with the court and some of the defendants were unable to pay the settlement. Ultimately, the main significance of the Trans Union case is that fairness opinions, typically provided by investment banks, are effectively now a legal requirement of any public company merger. =Criticism= Daniel Fischel, a leading scholar in the regulation of corporations, described the Smith v. Van Gorkom opinion as \\"one of the worst decisions in the history of corporate law.\\"Daniel Fischel, The Business Judgment Rule and the Trans Union Case, 40 Bus. Law. 1437, 1455 (1985) This criticism stems in part from the fact that the court made independent directors potentially liable for millions of dollars in damages for selling a company for approximately a 60% premium to its market value. Such liability provides a strong disincentive for the best potential directors to serve on the board, and one would expect such a disincentive to result in worse corporate governance. The decision has also been derided as the \\"Investment Banker's Relief Act of 1985\\" because of all the business it has generated for investment bankers from boards seeking to avoid liability or other legal entanglements.

It is a medium to large bird, striped white and brown, slightly smaller and paler than its near relative the greater prairie chicken. Adults range from 15.0-16.1 in (38-41 cm) in length and 22.1-28.7 oz (628-813 g) in weight. About half of its current population lives in western Kansas, with the other half in the sandhills and prairies of western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle including the Llano Estacado, eastern New Mexico, and southeastern Colorado. Like its larger relative, it is known for its lekking behavior. Considered \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN due to its restricted and patchy range, it is vulnerable to habitat destruction. There is evidence suggesting that global warming may have a particularly detrimental influence by greatly reducing the size of the sagebrush ecosystem. Subfossil remains are known, e.g., from Rocky Arroyo in the Guadalupe Mountains, outside the species' current range but where more habitat existed in the less humid conditions in the outgoing last ice age. Range contraction apparently took place no later than about 8000 BC. The United States Department of the Interior proposed creating a Lesser Prairie Chicken Preserve as a National Monument, but action was never taken action on the proposal. On March 27, 2014, the lesser prairie chicken was listed as threatened (T) under the Endangered Species Act but the listing was vacated in 2015 following a legal challenge and the bird's status remains uncertain. In 2015, Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan) introduced an amendment to legislation authorizing construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline that would overturn the listing.

Disarmament entails the physical removal of the means of combat from ex-belligerents (weapons, ammunition, etc.); demobilization entails the disbanding of armed groups; while reintegration describes the process of reintegrating former combatants into civilian society, ensuring against the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict.  Factors for successful DDR  Former combattants of the Seleka engaged in a DDR process in the Central African Republic, February 2017. DDR is somewhat different from the blanket term \\"peacekeeping\\", in that DDR requires certain conditions to be effectively implemented. For demobilisation and reintegration to occur, there must first be a successful disarmament of armed groups. In general terms, parties to a conflict must be willing to negotiate a peace settlement and bring an end to the conflict. If there is no end in sight, or not all parties are willing to negotiate a peace, this will make it difficult to establish trust between each party. Disarmament measures must also be applied to all parties of a conflict. One case that highlights both these elements is that of Somalia. The UN and US began disarming selected armed groups but not all, and there was no peace agreement agreed or on-going. Those groups who had been disarmed were then targeted by groups who had not been disarmed, and the violence continued. As mentioned above, trust is also a key factor of successful DDR, specifically in relation to disarming armed groups. Small scale acts may help engender trust on both sides, such as public appearances of group leaders together with international mediators. To strengthen trust, public bonfires of weapons taken from all parties to violence will show the disarming groups that the other groups are also handing over their weapons. Challenges of DDR One challenge or difficulty, as highlighted above, is that of forming trust between the different armed groups. If no peace agreement has already been reached but armed groups wish to start the DDR process, then the underlying issues that led to the violence in the first instance must be addressed. DDR cannot be approached as a purely technocratic exercise, and to not address the grievances of each group may seriously undermine or negatively influence the peace process. Further challenges appear when we consider reintegration of ex- combatants. Unlike other aspects of peace agreements such as strengthening democratic institutions, introducing fair elections and governmental structures, the reintegration of ex-combatants back into civilian society may be difficult to accurately monitor. This in part is due to its social nature: how do you measure how ex-combatants have integrated with society? How can you measure the societal cohesion that DDR aims to promote throughout the affected region? Civil war often involves high degrees of communal violence, and this poses a particular challenge for fighters who may have joined armed groups that committed violent acts in the ex-combatants' communities. Even if the individual ex-combatant in question did not commit violent acts against their own community, they may still face difficulties being accepted back if associated with a group that did. This may lead to disjointed familial ties, communal tensions, or ex-fighters choosing not to return home altogether. As such, it may be possible to successfully reintegrate fighters back into civilian society, but reintegrating them back into their own communities may be a much harder task. Requirements for successful DDR implementation There are 6 aspects to a successful DDR conversion: # Reduction of military expenditure # Reorientation of military research and development # Conversion of the arms industry # Demobilization and reintegration # Redevelopment of troops # Safe disposal and management of \\"surplus weapons\\" Demobilization is one aspect of conversion. Conclusion To assess the impact of demobilization one has to consider the resources involved, the dynamic processes of production, redistribution and the different factors and actors in policy making and implementation. The ultimate objective of demobilization and reintegration efforts should be to improve the welfare of people. Demobilization of combatants frees human potential that can contribute to achieving these objectives.

Essentially a follow-up to the better- known Mirari Vos of 1832, Singulari Nos focused strongly on the views of French priest Hughes Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais, who did not see any contradiction between Catholicism and then-modern ideals of liberalism and the separation of Church and State. Background In October 1830 Lamennais, Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, and Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert founded the newspaper, L'Avenir, which advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press, views were opposed by the French bishops. Despite being warned by Archbishop Quelen of Paris that their expectations were unrealistic, they sought support from Pope Gregory XVI.Chadwick, Owen. \\"Gregory XVI\\", A History of the Popes, 1830-1914, Oxford University Press, 2003 Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter.Bernard, Cook. \\"Lamennais, Hugues-Felicit√© Robert de (1782-1854)\\", Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions, (James Chastain, ed.), Ohio University, 2005 John Henry Newman described the situation in Rome at that time: > The French Revolution in July, 1830, had been followed in no long time by > insurrection within the papal territories; Austria intervened to reduce the > revolting cities; and France took possession of Ancona to keep Austria in > check. These events placed the Sovereign Pontiff between two opposite > dangers; his fears from France are intelligible enough; Austria, on the > other hand, had always been supposed to covet the portion of the pontifical > states on the north of the Apennines; and the suspicion had been so strong > in Rome, in 1821, that the government had not allowed the Austrian forces to > pass through the city on their way to Naples. Whilst then the Pope was in > this unpleasant dilemma, Russia, according to M. de la Mennais, stepped in > and offered her aid. She alleged that she could not possibly have any > interested views as regards the Italian peninsula, either revolutionary or > ambitious, and she offered to place a force at the Pope's disposal to defend > him against all emergencies. In return she did but ask, that the Pope would > take the part of the Autocrat against Poland, and instruct the Polish Roman > bishops accordingly. The offer was accepted on the specified > condition.Newman, John Henry. \\"Fall of de la Mennais\\", British Critic, > October 1837 Newman noted, \\"Nothing can be more discordant, less capable of a common measure, than a question of abstract religious truth, and a question of practice and matter of fact, in relation to the measures to be pursued by one secular power towards another; as discordant was the position of the Pope with that of the conductors of the Avenir.\\" Circulation of Lamannais's later account (1837) of his trip to Rome, Affaires de Rome, was prohibited in Prussia.\\"Abb√© de la Mennais\\", The New-York Review, Vol. 2, (Lambert Lilly, Coleb Sprague Henry, Joseph Green Cogswell, eds.), George Dearborn & Co., 1838 In August 1832 Gregory issued the encyclical Mirari vos. General in scope, it upheld clerical celibacy, and raised concerns over too close alliances between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated divorce, and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian statesGregory XVI, Mirari vos, Rome, August 15, 1832 It also denounced the views of Lemannais without specifically naming him. The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor detractors. Paroles d'un croyant Hugues-Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais (1826) While Lamennais agreed to submit to the Pope in matters of faith and morals, he noticeably did not retract any of his political views. Although he ceased publication of L'Avenir, Lamennais continued to be attacked by French conservatives. In 1834 he responded with a short, biting book, Paroles d'un croyant (Words of a Believer), in which he denounced all authority, civil as well as ecclesiastical. The book was a sensation. Franz Liszt dedicated the piano piece \\"Lyon\\" (S156 1) to Lamennais.Merrick, Paul. Revolution and Religion in the Music of Liszt, CUP Archive, 1987 Fyodor Dostoyevsky encouraged Alexander Milyukov to translate Words of a Believer into Church Slavonic.Frank, Joseph. Dostoevsky: The Stir of Liberation, 1860-1865, Vol. 3, Princeton University Press, 1986 Encyclical In early April 1834 when the French government attempted to suppress trade union activities, silk-weavers in Lyon rose in revolt. The government responded by arresting republican sympathizers in Paris and sending the army to put down the rising. The experience of the popes during the recent revolutions, being expelled from Rome, widespread unrest in the Papal States and temporal power to anti-Catholic forces, and the erosion of even spiritual allegiance, predisposed the reaction of the Papacy.Schultenover, S.J., David G., A View from Rome: On the Eve of the Modernist Crisis, New York: Fordham University Press, 1993 Gregory issued Singulari Nos on June 25. \\"We have learned of the pamphlet written in French under the title Paroles d'un croyant, for it has been printed by this man and disseminated everywhere. ... Though small in size, it is enormous in wickedness.Pope Gregory XVI, Singulari Nos, ¬ß2, June 25, 1834 ... Once the torch of treason is ignited everywhere, it ruins public order, fosters contempt of government, and stimulates lawlessness.\\" > We have studied the book entitled Paroles d'un croyant. By Our apostolic > power, We condemn the book: ... It corrupts the people by a wicked abuse of > the word of God, to dissolve the bonds of all public order and to weaken all > authority. It arouses, fosters, and strengthens seditions, riots, and > rebellions in the empires. We condemn the book because it contains false, > calumnious, and rash propositions which lead to anarchy; which are contrary > to the word of God; which are impious, scandalous, and erroneous; and which > the Church already condemned... The encyclical ends with plea for the author to recognize his errors. Effects Lamennais's brother Jean-Marie, by that time Superior General of the Mission Priests of the Immaculate Conception, repudiated Paroles and the two never met again.Harrison, Carol E., Romantic Catholics: France‚Äôs Postrevolutionary Generation in Search of a Modern Faith, Cornell University Press, 2014 Paroles and Gregory's response effectively allowed no middle ground between the two positions. Few of Lamennais's associates were willing to follow him out of the Church. J.P.T. Bury finds it ironic that the most lasting effect of Lamennais's polemics was a strengthening of Ultramontanism. He notes that Dom Prosper Gu√©ranger, who was an early Lemannais follower, became the principal agent of a liturgical revival and a uniform Roman Liturgy.Bury, J.P.T., \\"Religion and Relations of Churches and States\\", The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 10, CUP Archive, 1960 Lacordaire was instrumental in reestablishing the Dominican Order in France.

This film was directed by Robert Ramirez, produced by Scholastic Entertainment and Big Red Dog Productions, and originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. Pictures on February 20, 2004. The film depicts a giant red Labrador Retriever named Clifford (John Ritter) running away and joining a travelling animal show known as \\"Larry's Amazing Animals\\" with his best friends. Larry Gablegobble (Judge Reinhold), the presenter of the animal show, doesn't allow animals who have owners, so they pretend their dog tags are fake. The film takes place in the fictional island of \\"Birdwell Island\\", which the name is inspired by Norman Bridwell, the author of the books. This was John Ritter's final theatrical film role as he died on September 11, 2003. The film was dedicated to his memory, and it served as the series finale to the original show, as no new episodes aired after the film's release, though the show's spin-off Clifford's Puppy Days continued to air before concluding in 2006. The show would later be remade with the 2019 reboot.It is currently the only animated theatrical film directly based on a PBS Kids TV series, not counting Barney's Great Adventure or the films based on Sesame Street (the programming block did not exist at the time said films were made). The film notably depicts characters with sclera, in contrast to the books and TV series, which portrayed every character except the giant Clifford with black bead eyes. The film received mixed reviews but it was a box office success, grossing $3.3 million against a $70,000 budget. Plot The story begins in Birdwell Island, while Emily Elizabeth calls for her enormous red Labrador Retriever, Clifford. She hears a rustling in the bushes, and Clifford pops up and rushes toward her. Emily Elizabeth tells Clifford that they are going to be late for a carnival. Clifford is excited and then races away. Clifford visits the carnival with Emily Elizabeth and her friends, Charley and Jetta, and Clifford's friends, Cleo and T-Bone. Clifford, Cleo, and T-Bone are amazed by an animal act known as Larry's Amazing Animals, consisting of Shackelford the High Flying Ferret, Dorothy the High Wire Heifer aka Daring Cow, Dirk the Extreme Dachshund, and Rodrigo, Chihuahua of Steel. However, despite the animals best efforts, their show is failing due to their respective failed acts, but all remain oblivious of the truth as their owner and the show's host, Larry Gablegobble, expresses how proud he is of their efforts. After the show, Larry tells the worrisome carnival owner, Peter Tiberius \\"P.T.\\" Jones, that the only way for their performances to continue is to win a Tummy Yummies Animal Talent Contest, promising fame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies. When Clifford and his friends go to collect their autographs, Shackleford attempts to convince them to join the act, believing Clifford's size and appearance would help them improve and save their show, but none of them agree because they don't want to leave their owners. The next day, Clifford overhears the Howards' conversation with their neighbor Mr. Bleakman. He mistakenly believes he is a financial burden on the family and decides to join the Amazing Animals, with T-Bone and Cleo joining him. After escaping a town afraid of Clifford, the group finds Larry‚Äôs animals. Since Gablegobble cannot accept animals with owners, they dispose their dog tags, claiming they are to trick dogcatchers. Larry happily welcomes Clifford and his friends and during their next performance, Clifford manages to save the show, receiving a great round of applause and sparking jealously from Shackleford. Clifford soon begins to make a great and positive impact on the show as he manages to help the others improve their acts, such as helping Dorothy conquer her fear of heights. Clifford immediately becomes the star of the show, much to Shackleford's jealousy and annoyance, believing Clifford has begun to take his place, and the newspapers are sent to P.T., who is proud of Larry. Meanwhile, Emily Elizabeth searches for Clifford and finds out he ran away. Larry's Amazing Animals finally receives entry for the Tummy Yummies contest that will perform the next night. However, when Clifford goes to find Shackleford and reveals the news, Shackleford reveals his anger and jealousy towards Clifford. He believes they are all better off without him. Hurt by Shackleford‚Äôs words and missing Emily Elizabeth, Clifford decides to leave early and return home to Birdwell Island to reunite with Emily Elizabeth. Cleo and T-Bone join him, but managed to convince Clifford to return and in the process saves Larry and the others from their broken down bus and make it to the contest. Larry's Amazing Animals wins the contest, but the fun-loving CEO of Tummy Yummies, George Wolfsbottom, tricks Larry into signing a contract giving him full custody of Clifford and kidnaps him for his spoiled daughter Madison. At a hotel, Shackleford tries to get everyone to realize Clifford just wanted the Tummy Yummies, prompting a furiously disgusted Cleo to expose his true intentions. Shackleford realizes he was wrong about him and shows the tags to Larry, who contacts Emily Elizabeth. Larry drives the animals to Wolfsbottom‚Äôs mansion. While Larry talks to a security guard, the animals infiltrate the mansion and Shackleford breaks Clifford out of his cage. Shackleford apologizes to Clifford for being jealous, but T-Bone accidentally sets off the alarm and Wolfsbottom's security guards try to capture the animals. The group narrowly escape from the security guards and Emily Elizabeth arrives in time to claim Clifford before Wolfsbottom can get him. Wolfsbottom refuses to let her keep Clifford, showing his contract, but Madison, having a change of heart, steps in and convinces her dad to let Clifford go. Wolfsbottom tears up the contract and allows Clifford to go where he truly belongs. Cleo and T-Bone bid the Amazing Animals a farewell and Clifford reconciles with Shackleford. The film ends with Clifford, Emily Elizabeth, Cleo and T-Bone returning to Birdwell Island and moving on with their lives.

The orchestra traces it roots to December 18, 1926, the first concert broadcast by Tallinn Radio. The broadcast concert was performed by an ENSO predecessor, a trio headed by Hugo Sch√ºtz. The ensemble‚Äôs ranks grew steadily, and by 1939 the Radio Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra included 39 performers. In addition to radio concerts, the public enjoyed live symphonies presented by the orchestra in conjunction with guest artists from the Estonia Theatre. In 1939, one of Estonia‚Äôs most outstanding musical figures of the day, Olav Roots, accepted the role of orchestra director. With Roots as director, the Orchestra continued to perform symphonies in Tallinn throughout the WWII period. In the post-war years, the Orchestra was directed by Leo Tauts, Sergei Prohhorov and Roman Matsov, who was principal conductor from 1950-1963. By 1956 the Orchestra had 90 members. Despite the Soviet repertoire policy of the time, Maestro Roman Matsov managed to also bring oratorial works by such greats as Bach, H√§ndel, Mozart and Beethoven to the public. For the first time in what was then the Soviet Union, Matsov also managed to give audiences the listening pleasure of works by Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Anton Webern, Carl Orff and others. It was not unusual for the Tallinn audience to be among the first to hear symphonies by Dmitry Shostakovich; Tallinn was usually the third venue, only preceded by premiere performances in Moscow and Leningrad. Since the season 2020/21, its Chief Conductor and Artistic Director is Olari Elts. Neeme J√§rvi, the longest- serving chief conductor of the ERSO, continues to cooperate with the orchestra as Honorary Artictic Director for Life and the Artistic Adviser of the orchestra is Paavo J√§rvi . The orchestra has dazzled the world with numerous tours and participated in reputable international music festivals. They have played in prestigious venues such as the Konzerthaus Berlin, Musikverein in Vienna, Rudolfinum in Prague, Brucknerhaus in Linz, the Avery Fisher Hall (current David Geffen Hall) in New York, the Grand Hall of Saint Petersburg Philharmonia and the Concert Hall of the Mariinsky Theatre, the K√∂lner Philharmonie, Festspielhaus in Bregenz, Helsinki Music Centre, the Berwaldhallen in Stockholm, and many more ‚Äì including, of course, their home venue, the Estonia Concert Hall in Tallinn. In 2019, ENSO and Neeme J√§rvi opened the highly acclaimed Festival de Radio France et Montpellier. In addition to their praiseworthy live performances, the high quality of the musical recordings of the orchestra has been recognised by several renowned music magazines and the recordings have won several prizes, including a Grammy Award (conductor Paavo J√§rvi). The orchestra has enjoyed fruitful cooperation with highly acclaimed record companies such as Chandos, BIS, and Onyx, and in the past also with Alba Records, Harmonia Mundi, and Melodiya. In 2018, Neeme J√§rvi received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the magazine Gramophone and ENSO had the honour of performing at the Gramophone Classical Music Awards Gala. In addition to local radio and television channels, ENSO‚Äôs concerts have been broadcast by Mezzo and medici.tv. They have also reached many radio listeners in Europe via the EBU. As for conductors and soloists, ENSO is fortunate to perform with the very best from all around the world, including front-rank Estonian musicians. Commanding a repertoire that ranges from the Baroque period to the present time, the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra has had the honour to premiere symphonic pieces by almost every Estonian composer, including Arvo P√§rt, Erkki-Sven T√º√ºr, T√µnu K√µrvits, and Eduard Tubin. In 2018, when the Republic of Estonia celebrated its 100th birthday, ENSO was deeply involved in the anniversary programme both in Estonia and internationally.

It is based on the novella Death in Venice by the German author Thomas Mann, first published in 1912 as Der Tod in Venedig. Plot Gustav von Aschenbach, a composer, travels to Venice for health reasons. There, he becomes obsessed with the stunning beauty of an adolescent Polish boy named Tadzio who is staying with his family at the same Grand H√¥tel des Bains on the Lido as Aschenbach. While Aschenbach attempts to find peace and quiet, the rest of the city is gripped by a cholera epidemic, and the city authorities do not inform the holiday-makers of the problem for fear that they will leave. As Aschenbach and the other guests make day-trips into the city centre, they begin to realize that something is seriously wrong. Aschenbach decides to leave, but in a moment of impulse decides to stay. However, he himself is dying from heart disease. Rejuvenated by the presence of Tadzio - though they never actually converse - he visits the barber who, in his words, \\"returns to you merely what has been lost\\", dyeing his grey hair black and whitening his face and reddening his lips to try to make him look younger. As he leaves the barber's shop the barber exclaims: \\"And now Sir is ready to fall in love as soon as he pleases\\". Aschenbach continues to gaze at Tadzio from afar, the latter more aware that he is being gazed at. In the climactic scene, Aschenbach sees Tadzio being beaten up on the beach by an older boy. When released, Tadzio walks away from him alone towards the horizon. He suddenly turns back to look at Aschenbach, then turns away to face the sun, and stretches his arm out towards it. Aschenbach too, stretches his hand as if to reach Tadzio, and at that very moment‚Äîheightened by the crescendo in Mahler's Adagietto‚Äîhe dies from a heart attack. A few people notice him collapsed on his chair and alert the hotel staff. They carry Aschenbach's body away.

This allows the musical score, in particular the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony by Gustav Mahler, which opens and closes the film, and sections from Mahler's Third Symphony, to represent Aschenbach's writing. Apart from this change, the film is relatively faithful to the book, but with added scenes where Aschenbach and a musician friend debate the degraded aesthetics of his music. The film's score was performed by the Orchestra dell'Accademia de Santa Cecilia, conducted by Franco Mannino, and subsequently released by EMI. In addition to the music of Gustav Mahler's Third and Fifth Symphonies which embodied the character and suffering of Aschenbach, Visconti included a number of pieces from other composers. Although overshadowed as they are by the dominance of Mahler they play an important part in the film's narrative. One is the ballad by Armando Gil, sung by the strolling player, Chi con le donne vole aver fortuna (He who wants to be successful with the ladies). Another is Beethoven's famous piano piece F√ºr Elise played by Claudio Gizzi. The third which is particularly evocative, is Modest Mussorgsky's Lullaby which in the film, heralds Ashenbach's death. It is sung by Mascia Predit, an unforgettable soprano whom Visconti was happily surprised to discover among the extras when filming the last scene. Hush, hush-a-bye, my little grandchild, Sleep in slumber deep, little peasant's son Hush, hush-a-bye; our forefathers never saw such a misfortune, But misfortune has come, disaster upon disaster, . . . Hush, hush, hush-a-bye! Your small white body lies there in the cradle, Your soul flies in the heavens, Your quiet slumber is guarded by God himself. By your side stand bright angels, Bright angels! Behind the scenes In the second volume of his autobiography, Snakes and Ladders, Bogarde recounts how the film crew created his character's deathly white skin for the final scenes of the film, just as he dies. The makeup department tried various face paints and creams, none of which were satisfactory, as they smeared. When a suitable cream was found and the scenes were shot, Bogarde recalls that his face began to burn terribly. The tube of cream was found and written on the side was \\"Keep away from eyes and skin\\": the director had ignored this and had been testing it out, as small patches, on various members of the film crew, before finally having it applied to Bogarde's face. In another volume of his memoirs, An Orderly Man, Dirk Bogarde relates that, after the finished film was screened for them by Visconti in Los Angeles, the Warner Bros. executives wanted to write off the project, fearing it would be banned in the United States for obscenity because of its subject matter. They eventually relented when a gala premiere of Death in Venice was organized in London, with Elizabeth II and Princess Anne attending, to gather funds for the sinking Italian city. In 2003, Bj√∂rn Andr√©sen gave an interview to The Guardian in which he expressed his dislike of the fame Death in Venice brought him and how he sought to distance himself from the objectifying image he acquired from playing Tadzio. He stated that he now disapproves of the film's subject matter: \\"Adult love for adolescents is something that I am against in principle. Emotionally perhaps, and intellectually, I am disturbed by it ‚Äì because I have some insight into what this kind of love is about.\\" He also recounted attending the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival: \\"I was just 16 and Visconti and the team took me to a gay nightclub. Almost all the crew were gay. The waiters at the club made me feel very uncomfortable. They looked at me uncompromisingly as if I was a nice meaty dish...it was the first of many such encounters.\\" Critical reception Death in Venice holds a 71% \\"fresh\\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with an average score of 7.04/10. Film historian Lawrence J. Quirk wrote, in his study, The Great Romantic Films (1974), \\"Some shots of Bj√∂rn Andr√©sen, the Tadzio of the film, could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the Louvre or the Vatican in Rome.\\" He says Andr√©sen did not represent just a pretty youngster as an object of perverted lust, but that novelist Mann and director-screenwriter Visconti intended him as a symbol of beauty in the realm of Michelangelo's David or Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the beauty that moved Dante to \\"...seek ultimate aesthetic catharsis in the distant figure of Beatrice.\\" In 2011, writer Will Aitken published Death in Venice: A Queer Film Classic, a critical analysis the film, as part of Arsenal Pulp Press's Queer Film Classics series.Richard Burnett, \\"Montreal author Will Aitken revives Death in Venice\\" . Xtra!, January 26, 2012. In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.

It takes its name from the natural gas which bubbled up through the spring and would burn when lit. In the early 19th century, wells were drilled at the springs to produce brine which was evaporated to produce salt. Some petroleum was produced along with the salt brine. By 1836, the salt wells were producing 50 to 100 barrels per year of oil that was sold as illuminating oil.Edgar Wesley Owen (1975) Trek of the Oil Finders, Tulsa, Okla.: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p.10. The wells at Burning Springs produced and sold petroleum many years before the Drake Oil Well at Titusville, Pennsylvania. John V. Rathbone bought 100 acres in 1842 and a decade later drilled a new well, only to discover it produced more oil than salt. However, by 1859 it was producing 7 40-gallon barrels of oil per day, more effectively than gathering oil from the nearby river. The first well at Burning Springs drilled to obtain oil rather than salt was begun in 1859, and soon the Rathbone family (John V. and his son John C. (\\"Cass\\") Rathbone), sold 70 one-acre plots to others who wished to drill. In 1861, 10,000 people moved to the area, and the boom town grew to more than a mile long. Burning Springs was then larger than Elizabeth, the Wirt County seat, as well as Parkersburg, where the barrels transported down the Little Kanawha River were transferred to larger boats on the Ohio River or to railroad cars.https://www.theclio.com/entry/20351 As the American Civil War had begun, Col. Cass Rathbone recruited a militia company which became the 11th West Virginia Infantry, with his brother in law Daniel E. Frost as Lt. Col. However, on September 2, 1862, Col. Rathbone surrendered with about 200 troops to Confederate raiders in Spencer (the Roane County seat), which some believed partial payment for protection from Confederate raids on the oil field. The raiders had immediately paroled Rathbone and his men, but Rathbone was transferred to Pennsylvania, then President Lincoln dismissed him from the army in January 1863. On May 9, 1863 during the Jones-Imboden Raid partially to prevent West Virginia's statehood, Confederate raiders set every oil well afire, as well as 120,000 gallons ready for shipping, destroying the town and causing the river (and its forested banks) to burn for miles. The Rathbones and others managed to rebuild somewhat, but in 1865 following the patriarch's death and several others during the war, the remaining Rathbones sold their interest for $400,000 and moved west. Others thus drilled hundreds of wells in the following decades. Although the town is now small, some oil production continues to this day. The Burning Springs Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, although not many original buildings remain (fire being a constant danger for the wood structures). The Ruble Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In addition to a historical marker remembering the Rathbones, a park and museum were opened in 2002.

Early life Dolours and her sister, Marian, also an IRA member, were the daughters of Albert Price, a prominent Irish republican and former IRA member from Belfast. Their aunt, Bridie Dolan, was blinded and lost both hands in an accident handling IRA explosives. Paramilitary activity Price became involved in Irish republicanism in the late 1960s and joined the Provisional IRA in the early 1970s. She participated in the car bombing of the Old Bailey in London on 8 March 1973, which injured over 200 people and is believed to have contributed to the death of one person who suffered a fatal heart attack. The two sisters were arrested, along with Gerry Kelly, Hugh Feeney and six others, on the day of the bombing, as they were boarding a flight to Ireland. They were tried and convicted at the Great Hall in Winchester Castle on 14 November 1973. Although originally sentenced to life imprisonment, which was to run concurrently for each criminal charge, their sentence was eventually reduced to 20 years. Price served seven years for her part in the bombing. She immediately went on a hunger strike demanding to be moved to a prison in Northern Ireland. The hunger strike lasted for 208 days because the hunger strikers were force-fed by prison authorities to keep them alive. On the back of the hunger-striking campaign, her father contested West Belfast at the UK General Election of February 1974, receiving 5,662 votes (11.9%).West Belfast election results The Price sisters, Hugh Feeney, and Gerry Kelly were moved to Northern Ireland prisons in 1975 as a result of an IRA truce.IRA Truce: 9 February 1975 to 23 January 1976 ‚Äì Summary of Main Events CAIN Web Service, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 3 January 2016. In 1980 Price received the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and was freed on humanitarian grounds in 1981, purportedly suffering from anorexia nervosa due to the invasive trauma of daily force feedings. The Price sisters remained active politically. In the late 1990s, Price and her sister claimed that they had been threatened by their former colleagues in the IRA and Sinn F√©in for publicly opposing the Good Friday Agreement i.e. the cessation of the IRA's military campaign. Price was a contributor to The Blanket, an online journal, edited by former Provisional IRA member Anthony McIntyre, until it ceased publication in 2008. Personal life After her release in 1980, she married Irish actor Stephen Rea, with whom she had two sons, Danny and Oscar. They divorced in 2003. Later life In 2001, Price was arrested in Dublin and charged with possession of stolen prescription pads and forged prescriptions. She pleaded guilty and was fined ¬£200 and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In February 2010, it was reported by The Irish News that Price had offered help to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in locating graves of three men, Joe Lynskey, Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, who were allegedly killed by the IRA and whose bodies have not been found. She was the subject of the 2018 feature-length documentary I, Dolours in which she gave an extensive filmed interview. Allegations against Gerry Adams In 2010 Price claimed Gerry Adams had been her officer commanding when she was active in the IRA. Adams, who has always denied being a member of the IRA, denied her allegation. Price admitted taking part in the murder of Jean McConville, as part of an IRA action in 1972. She claimed the murder of McConville, a mother of 10, was ordered by Adams when he was an IRA leader in West Belfast. Adams subsequently publicly further denied Price's allegations, stating that the reason for them was that she was opposed to the Provisional Irish Republican Army's abandonment of paramilitary warfare in favour of politics in 1994, in the facilitation of which Adams had been a key figure. Boston College tapes Oral historians at Boston College interviewed both Dolours Price and her fellow IRA paramilitary Brendan Hughes between 2001 and 2006, the two giving detailed interviews for the historical record of the activities in the IRA, which were recorded on condition that the content of the interviews was not to be released during their lifetimes. Prior to Price's death, in May 2011, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)PSNI subpoena of Boston College materials, bbc.co.uk; accessed 3 January 2016. subpoenaed the material, possibly as part of an investigation into the disappearance of a number of people in Northern Ireland during the 1970s. In June 2011, the college filed a motion to quash the subpoena. A spokesman for the college stated that \\"our position is that the premature release of the tapes could threaten the safety of the participants, the enterprise of oral history, and the ongoing peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland.\\" In July 2011, US federal prosecutors asked a judge to require the college to release the tapes to comply with treaty obligations with the United Kingdom. On 6 July 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed with the government's position that the subpoena should stand. On 17 October 2012, the United States Supreme Court temporarily blocked the college from handing over the interview tapes. In January 2013 Price died, and in April 2013, the Supreme Court turned away an appeal that sought to keep the interviews from being supplied to the PSNI. The order left in place a lower court ruling that ordered Boston College to give the Justice Department portions of recorded interviews with Dolours Price. Federal officials wanted to forward the recordings to police investigating the murder of Jean McConville.Boston College IRA interviews update, wbur.org; accessed 21 December 2015. Death On 24 January 2013 Price was found dead at her Malahide, County Dublin home, from a toxic effect of mixing prescribed sedative and anti-depressant medication. The inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure. Her body was buried at Milltown Cemetery in West Belfast. References Further reading *Keefe, Patrick Radden.

The town is situated approximately north of Winnipeg on PTH 67. It is known for its limestone quarries. The local festival is the Quarry Days which is usually held over three days in August on Main Street. The town is surrounded by the R.M. of Rockwood. History When the last ice age retreated, as well as the prairies, escarpments such as Riding Mountain were left behind. In addition to these, smaller elevations were left behind such as Stony Mountain and Stonewall. It is believed that these escarpments were used as look-outs by early hunters approximately 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. These formations were later used as buffalo jumps by the indigenous populations. Stonewall was founded by Samuel Jacob Jackson in 1878, after he acquired the land the town is built upon in 1875. However, Jackson did not move to Stonewall himself until 1881. In the early 1880s, the quarry opened with the focus of their operation being the production of quicklime. During the peak times of the quarry, large amounts of dynamite was used for blasting the rock. The dynamite was kept in the powder magazine which has since been rebuilt near the entrance to Stonewall Quarry Park. On June 30, 1880, the CPR railway line between Winnipeg and Victoria Junction, east of Stonewall, was completed. The construction of the line continued west passing through Stonewall, Hanlan and Meadow Lea before turning south-west towards Portage la Prairie during the summer of 1880. The transcontinental line was originally planned to pass through Selkirk, but was actually built through Winnipeg following heavy lobbying from the city. The line west of Stonewall was therefore rebuilt through Rosser. The line north-west from Stonewall was subsequently extended through Teulon, Komarno before eventually reaching Arborg in 1910. In 2008, the RM of Rockwood decided that there was no purpose left with the line. With the city of Winnipeg's help the line was taken out. The present town hall was built in 1912 using local limestone. Following the closure of the quarry, Kinsmen Lake was developed on the site and opened to the public on August 10, 1956. The lake has become a popular location for locals and visitors to the town. In 1983, the town council initiated a project to develop the former quarry site around Kinsmen Lake into a historical site and natural area. Education Stonewall is situated in the Interlake school division and is served by three schools: * √âcole R. W. Bobby Bend School offers a dual-track (French Immersion and English)kindergarten to grade 4 students; * √âcole Stonewall Centennial School offers a dual-track program for grade 5 to 8 students; and * Stonewall Collegiate Institute offers classes for grades 9-12. Government =Municipal= Stonewall is represented by a Head of Council (Mayor), a Deputy Mayor and three councillors.

Climate Stonewall experiences a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with warm to hot summers and cold winters Sports Stonewall is home to the Stonewall Jets of the MMJHL and the Stonewall Rams of the WHSHL. Stonewall has two Hockey rinks: the Stonewall Arena (Ice Palace) and the Veterans Memorial Sports Complex. The only curling rink is the Sunova Credit Union Curling Rink. Stonewall has a senior baseball team named the Stonewall Blue Jays. Attractions =Stonewall Quarry Park= Old Quarry Park Interpretive Centre (as seen 3 months before it burned down). A new one was opened on the fourth anniversary of the fire The Stonewall Quarry Park has been maintained as a natural area on the edge of town and provides picnic facilities and walking trails for visitors and residents alike. The nine baseball diamonds are available for hire and have been used for the Blue Jays Cups in 1997 and 1998, the Pan Am Games in 1999 and the Western Canada Summer Games in 2003. There is also a campsite and swimming available in Kinsmen Lake. Stonewall Quarry Park also displays the many aspects of limestone production. There was a museum and visitor centre, however these were destroyed by fire in the early hours of November 11, 2007. The new interpretive centre was opened in fall 2011. =Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre= Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre is a restored prairie marsh featuring artesian springs, aspen-oak bluff, waterfowl lure crop, tall-grass prairie and of trails. The marsh is home to mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates.

LeBel Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT. Stevens was head of the Speech Communication Group in MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), and was one of the world's leading scientists in acoustic phonetics. He was awarded the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in 1999, and the IEEE James L. Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award in 2004. He died in 2013 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. Education =Early education= Ken Stevens was born in Toronto on March 23, 1924. His older brother, Pete, was born in England; Ken was born four years later, shortly after the family emigrated to Canada. His childhood ambition was to become a doctor, because he admired an uncle who was a doctor. He attended high school at a school attached to the Department of Education at the University of Toronto. Stevens attended college in the School of Engineering at the University of Toronto on a full scholarship. He lived at home throughout his undergraduate years. Though Stevens himself could not fight in World War II because of his visual impairment, his brother was away for the entire war; his parents tuned in nightly to the BBC for updates. Stevens majored in engineering physics at the university, covering topics from the design of motorized machines through to basic physics, which was taught by the physics department. During summers he worked in the defense industry, including one summer at a company that was developing radar. He received both his S.B. and S.M. degrees in 1945. Stevens had been a teacher since his undergraduate years, when he lectured sections of home economics that involved some aspect of physics. After receiving his master's degree, he stayed at the University of Toronto as an instructor, teaching courses to young men returning from the war, including his own older brother. He was a fellow of the Ontario Foundation from 1945 to 1946, then worked as an instructor at the University of Toronto until 1948. During his master's research Stevens became interested in control theory, and took courses from the applied mathematics department, where one of his professors recommended that he should apply to MIT for doctoral studies. =Doctoral studies= Shortly after Stevens was admitted to MIT, a new professor named Leo Beranek noticed that Stevens had taken acoustics. Beranek contacted Stevens in Toronto, to ask if he would be a teaching assistant for Beranek's new acoustics course, and Stevens agreed. Shortly after that, Beranek contacted Stevens again to offer him a research position on a new speech project, which Stevens also accepted. The Radiation Laboratory at MIT (building 20) was converted, after the war, into the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE); among other labs, RLE hosted Beranek's new Acoustics Lab. In November 1949, the office next to Ken's was given to a visiting doctoral student from Sweden named Gunnar Fant, with whom he formed a friendship and collaboration that would last more than half a century. Stevens focused on the study of vowels during his doctoral research; in 1950 he published a short paper arguing that the autocorrelation could be used to discriminate vowels, while his 1952 doctoral thesis reported perceptual results for vowels synthesized using a set of electronic resonators. Fant convinced Stevens that a transmission-line model of the vocal tract was more flexible than a resonator model and the two published this work together in 1953. Ken credits Fant with the association between the Linguistics Department and the Research Laboratory for Electronics at MIT. Roman Jakobson, a phonologist at Harvard, had an office at MIT by 1957, while Morris Halle joined the MIT Linguistics Department and moved to RLE in 1951. Stevens' collaborations with Halle began with acoustics, but grew to focus on the way in which acoustics and articulation organize the sound systems of language. Stevens defended his doctoral thesis in 1952; his doctoral committee included his adviser Leo Beranek, as well as J. C. R. Licklider and Walter A. Rosenblith. After receiving his doctorate, Stevens went to work at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (now BBN Technologies) in Harvard Square. In the early 1950s, Beranek decided to retire from the MIT faculty in order to work full-time at BBN. He knew that Stevens loved to teach, so he encouraged Stevens to apply for a position on the MIT faculty. Stevens did so, and joined the faculty in 1954. Research, teaching and service =Scientific contributions= Stevens is best known for his contributions to the fields of Phonology, speech perception, and speech production. Stevens' most well-known book, Acoustic Phonetics, is organized according to the distinctive features of Stevens' phonological system. Contributions to phonology Stevens is perhaps best known for his proposal of a theory that answers the question: Why are the sounds of the world's languages (their phonemes or segments) so similar to one another? On first learning a foreign language, one is struck by the remarkable differences that can exist between one language's sound system and that of any other. Stevens turned the student's perception on its head: rather than asking why languages are different, he asked, if the sound system of each language is completely arbitrary, why are languages so similar? His answer is the quantal theory of speech. Quantal theory is supported by a theory of language change, developed in collaboration with Samuel Jay Keyser, which postulates the existence of redundant or enhancement features. Contributions to speech perception The quantal theory suggests that the phonological inventory of a language is defined primarily by the acoustic characteristics of each segment, with boundaries specified by the acoustic-articulatory mapping. The implication is that phonological segments must have some type of acoustic invariance. Blumstein and Stevens demonstrated what appeared to be an invariant relationship between the acoustic spectrum and the perceived sound: by adding energy to the burst spectrum of \\"pa\\" at a particular frequency, it is possible to turn it into \\"ta\\" or \\"ka\\" respectively, depending on the frequency. Presence of the extra energy causes perception of the lingual consonant; its absence causes perception of the labial. Stevens' recent work has re-structured the theory of acoustic invariance into a shallow hierarchical perceptual model, the model of acoustic landmarks and distinctive features. Contributions to speech production While on sabbatical at KTH in Sweden in 1962, Stevens volunteered as a participant in cineradiography experiments being conducted by Sven √ñhman. Stevens' cineradiographic films are among the most widely distributed; copies exist on laserdisc, and some are available online. After returning to MIT, Stevens agreed to supervise the research of a dentistry student named Joseph S. Perkell. Perkell's knowledge of oral anatomy permitted him to trace Stevens' X-ray films onto paper, and to publish the results. Other contributions to the study of speech production include a model by which one can predict the spectral shape of turbulent speech excitation (depending on the dimensions of the turbulent jet), and work related to the vocal fold configurations that lead to different modes of phonation. =Stevens as a mentor= Stevens joined MIT as an assistant professor in 1954. He became an associate professor in 1957, a full professor in 1963, and was appointed as the Clarence J. Lebel Chaired Professor in 1977. One of his long-time collaborators, Dennis Klatt (who wrote DECtalk while working in Stevens' lab), said that \\"As a leader, Ken is known for his devotion to students and his miraculous ability to run a busy laboratory while appearing to manage by a principle of benevolent anarchy.\\" The first doctoral thesis Stevens signed at MIT was that of his fellow student, James L. Flanagan, in 1955. Flanagan started graduate school at MIT in the same year as Stevens, but without a prior master's degree; he earned his M.S. in 1950 under Beranek's supervision, then finished his doctoral thesis under Stevens' supervision in 1955. Stevens estimated in 2001 that he had supervised approximately forty Ph.D. candidates. On the occasion of his receipt of the Gold Medal of the Acoustical Society of America, in 1995, colleagues wrote of Stevens' Speech Group that \\"during its existence of almost four decades\\" it \\"has been outstanding in the support that it has provided to women researchers, many of whom have gone on to populate the upper echelons of research labs throughout the world.\\". Stevens‚Äô laboratory has been referred to by colleagues as a \\"national treasure\\" =Professional service= Stevens was active in the Acoustical Society of America since his time as a graduate student. He was a member of the executive council from 1963 to 1966, Vice President from 1971‚Äì2, and President of the Society from 1976‚Äì7. He is a Fellow of the ASA. In 1983 he received its Silver Medal in Speech Communication, and in 1995 he received the Gold Medal from the society. Stevens was also active in the IEEE, where he held the rank of IEEE Life Fellow. In 2004, Ken Stevens and Gunnar Fant were the joint first winners of the IEEE James L. Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award. Stevens was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a 1999 recipient of the United States National Medal of Science.

Early life and career Coy Turnbull (the original spelling) was born on December 12, 1976 in Elmhurst, Queens, New York. Most of his early years were spent in New York. When he was 13, Turnbull's family moved to Asheboro, North Carolina. There, he learned the ins and outs of the comic industry from working at a local comic shop with fellow future comic inker John \\"Waki\\" Wycough. Turnbull learned from the likes of local artist Randy Green and Rick Ketcham, who mentored him in preparation for a future in comics. In 1997, Turnbull moved back to New York to pursue a career in comics. His skills were noticed and he began work as a background artist on Marvel projects for Adam Pollian and Walter McDaniel. In 2002, Turnbull's big break happened during the Wizard World Chicago Comic Convention, at a portfolio review with Aspen MLT's Frank Mastromauro (Executive Vice President) and Peter Steigerwald (Vice President of Publishing). The work caught their eyes, and a week after the con they contacted him about future employment with Aspen MLT. After receiving the penciler job with Aspen MLT, Turnbull moved to Santa Monica, California to work in the Marina Del Rey studio. Working under the direction of Michael Turner, Turnbull's talent grew, and with that followed Turner's run on Fathom with his own run starting with Fathom Volume 2. Not feeling hindered by the large fan following of Turner's work, Turnbull was able to follow Mike's work with his own and bring his influence to the comic during his run. Following Turnbull's run on Fathom, he has since found work with DC Comics (working on Flash and Superman Confidential), Marvel Comics (Terror INC, New Warriors, Black Panther and One Month 2 Live storyline) and other comic projects.

It is based on the play of the same name by Robert Bolt, which was previously adapted in the Academy Award winning 1966 film A Man for All Seasons. It was the first made- for-television film produced on behalf of the TNT (Turner Network Television) television network. The film stars Heston as More, Vanessa Redgrave (who had a small cameo in the version from 1966) as his wife Alice More, Sir John Gielgud as Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Martin Chamberlain as King Henry VIII, Richard Johnson as the Duke of Norfolk (historically, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk), and Roy Kinnear as the narrator, \\"The Common Man\\", who was cut from the previous film. (The \\"Common Man' functions in the manner of a Greek chorus throughout the play, appearing at crucial moments and seeming to comment on the action.) The film follows the original stage play more literally and runs half an hour longer than the 1966 film, and could be considered \\"stagier\\" than that film, which divided the Common Man into several more realistic characters and omitted portions of the play.

Today the mausoleum and its adjacent mosque are under the purview of Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura. The mosque is not to be confused for another mosque with a similar name along Geylang Road.  History  The makam sat on top of Mount Palmer, but following an 1890 refurbishment by Syed Mohamed bin Ahmed bin Abdul Rahman Alsagoff (Nong Chik), it was rebuilt with 52 stairs. A merchant from Betawi (now Jakarta) and a good friend of Habib Nuh, Haji Muhammad Salleh had built a surau for Habib Nuh before the 1860s. The surau known as Surau Kampong Sambau, was demolished and replaced with the present-day Masjid Haji Muhammad Salleh in 1903.  Habib Noh  Habib Nuh bin Muhammad bin Zain bin Abdul Rahman Alhabshi (178827July 1866) is one of the well-known Islamic saints (Wali Allah) of South East Asia. He was also widely known as The Grand Saint Of Singapore. Born in 1788 into a family of five brothers on board ship en route from Palembang to Pulau Pinang, he arrived in Singapore before 1819. Habib Nuh was a direct descendant of Muhammad and was named after Nuh (Noah). He came to be held in high regard by not only Muslim community but also non-Muslim and seafarers as well as renowned for distributing cash to local children. Habib Nuh's father, Habib Muhammad bin Zain Alhabshi, also known as Habib Putih, worked as a palace official under Sultan Ahmad Tajudin Halim Shah II of Kedah. The seat of the Kedah government then was at Kota Kuala Muda. When his first wife died, Habib Muhammad married Ku Pahmah, widow of Syed Yasin Al-Anggawi Al-Hassani who was killed at Limbong Kapal when the Siamese attacked Kedah in 1821. After the marriage, the family moved to Pulau Pinang. Habib Nuh also has a sister by the name of Sharifah Aloyah whose descendants still reside in Pulau Pinang. After Habib Nuh died, folklore tells of how on his body's journey to Telok Blangah Muslim Cemetery, the pallbearers could no longer bear the weight of the coffin. When the mourners remembered Habib Nuh had wanted to be interred on Mount Palmer, they could once more lift the coffin. After Habib Nuh's death a keramat or shrine was built over the grave, which became a place of Muslim pilgrimage and attracted Haj visitors from afar afield as the Dutch East Indies and China on their way to Mecca. = Siblings = Habib Nuh had four male siblings:- *Habib Abdul Rahman (resided in Yemen) *Habib Arifin (resided in Pulau Pinang) *Habib Zain (resided in Johor) *Habib Salikin (resided in Riau) = Offspring = Habib Nuh fathered three children:- *Sharifah Raguan; died at a very young age *Syed Ahmad; had a son by the name of Syed Shaikh *Sharifah Badariah; married to Syed Muhammad bin Hassan Al-Syatrie and they had a daughter by the name of Sharifah Rogayah. Sharifah Rogayah who died at Bukit Pasoh in 1891 and buried at Duxton Plain Park married to Syed Alwi bin Ali Aljunied and they had five children:- Syed Abdul Rahman, Sharifah Zubaidah, Syed Abdullah, Sharifah Zainah and Sharifah Maznah. = Death Anniversary (Haul) = Habib Nuh's death anniversary ceremony (or Haul) is often held on the last day of the month Rabiul Akhir. It starts about 'Asr with various invited 'ulamas or religious scholars from within Singapore and overseas giving lectures. Maulid and Tahlil are read after Maghrib. Generous food is then served to the hundreds of guests regardless of race or religion, after Isya' prayers.  Administration and Current Status  Habib Nuh's family (from his only son, Syed Ahmad) at first administered the makam through a trust fund known as Habib Nuh Trust Fund, with responsibility for the tomb's upkeep later transferred to the Muslims And Hindus Endowment Board in 1936, and finally in 1968 to the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura. In providing Muslim office workers a convenient location for prayers, the institution continues to play a major role in the community. In addition to the upkeep of visitors to the mausoleum, it also receives high- profile scholars for lectures and Khutbah and other religious services. In July 2017, the mosque and mausoleum have been upgraded with better facilities and greater accessibility to the hilltop shrine. Key architectural features are still preserved.http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/haji-muhammad- salleh-mosque-reopens-after-146m-revamp Transportation The mosque is accessible from Tanjong Pagar MRT station.

In this instance, the Spanish word estuario is used to describe what in English would normally be called part estuary, part tidal river. The estuary becomes a tidal river which extends into the city of Bilbao, starting from the Bilbao Abra bay. It hosts the port of Bilbao throughout its length, although the Port Authority has recently restored most of the upper reaches to Bilbao and other municipalities for their urban regeneration. The port is now being transferred to the seaboard on the coast at Santurtzi and Zierbena. Downstream from Bilbao the river divides its metropolitan area in its left bank (Barakaldo, Sestao, Portugalete and Santurtzi) and right bank (Erandio, Leioa and Getxo).

She helped organise protests against the Gulf War and was involved in free education campaigns throughout the early 1990s, as well as participating in nearly every left-wing political cause over the past decade (including her own defence campaign as one of the Austudy Five). Biography Having spent her early years in the United States, Jill Sparrow was raised in Melbourne and attended University there, working in Student Unions and at the early ISP Vicnet, an organisation providing free internet access and advocating community empowerment via freeing flows of information. She is the author, with Jeff Sparrow, of two books, Radical Melbourne: a Secret History and Radical Melbourne II: the Enemy Within. As one of the founding members of Socialist Alternative, she has been active in various Trotskyist groups aligned to the International Socialist Tendency including the International Socialist Organisation. She is currently at work on a science fiction project with Paul Voermans and is a founding member of Rumspringe Cooperative. Non-fiction Work Radical Melbourne, published by Vulgar Press, written in collaboration with her brother Jeff Sparrow, presents a guide through the first hundred years of political radicalism in Melbourne, focusing on the structures, streets and public places that remain today. It concentrates on identifying the physical traces of radical Melbourne, in the hope that geographical familiarity will provide a cultural and political bridge between the struggles of the past and the people of the present. Radical Melbourne is a secret history of Melbourne, illustrated by rarely seen images from the archives of the State Library of Victoria. The book originated in a series of tours conducted by the Sparrows. The authors say, \\"The secret history of this city seemed to us an inspiration.\\" Australian-born journalist John Pilger called Radical Melbourne \\"a brilliantly original, long overdue unveiling of a great city's true past\\" and has spawned a sequel and Radical Brisbane, a similar book about the Queensland capital, by Raymond Evans and Carole Ferrier. Radical Melbourne 2: The enemy within, also published by Vulgar, uncovers a story of secret police and secret armies, guerrilla artists and underground cells, militant unionists and intransigent peaceniks.

This very large species of flatfish is native to the North Pacific and is fished by commercial fisheries, sport fishers, and subsistence fishers. Distribution The Pacific halibut is found on the continental shelf of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Fishing for the Pacific halibut is mostly concentrated in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, off the west coast of Canada. Small halibut catches are reported in coastal Washington, Oregon, and California. Pacific halibut is broken up into 10 regularity management areas. Halibut are demersal, living on or near the bottom of the water and prefer water temperatures ranging from . Pacific halibut belong to the family Pleuronectidae. From November to March, mature halibut concentrate annually on spawning grounds along the edge of the continental shelf at depths from . Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to migrate long distances. Halibut of all ages and sizes are involved in a predominantly clockwise (northwest to southeast) migration from their settlement areas (western part of the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea), reproductive fish also make regular seasonal migrations from more shallow feeding grounds in summer to deeper spawning grounds in winter. Characteristics Pacific halibut have diamond-shaped bodies. They are more elongated than most flatfishes, the width being about one-third of the length. It has a high arch in the lateral line over the pectoral fin, and a lunate, or crescent-shaped tail, which is different from other flat fishes.Schultz, Ken. Ken Scultz‚Äôs Essentials of Fishing.John Wiley and & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey, 2010. , pp. 66-67 Small scales are embedded in the skin. Halibut have both eyes on their dark upper side. The color on the dark side varies, but tends to assume the coloration of the ocean bottom. The underside is lighter, appearing more like the sky from below. This color adaptation allows halibut to avoid detection by both prey and predator. They are one of the largest flatfish (only surpassed by the closely related Atlantic halibut), and can weigh up to and grow to over long.Pacific halibut NOAA FishWatch. Retrieved 7 November 2012. Food Being strong swimmers, halibut are able to eat a large variety of fishes, including cod, turbot, and pollock, and some invertebrates, such as octopus, crab and shrimp. Sometimes, halibut leave the ocean bottom to feed on pelagic fish, such as salmon, sand lance, and herring, and even seal remains have been found in their stomach. Life cycle Spawning takes place during the winter months, with the peak of activity occurring from December through February. Most spawning takes place off the edge of the continental shelf in deep waters of . Male halibut become sexually mature at seven to eight years of age, while females attain sexual maturity at eight to 12 years. Females lay 0.5 to 4.0 million eggs annually, depending on the size of the fish. The Pacific Halibut: Biology, Fishery and Management IPHC Technical Report No. 40, 1998 Fertilized eggs hatch after about 15 days. Free-floating larvae float for up to six months and can be transported several hundred miles counter-clockwise by North Pacific currents. During the free-floating stage, many changes take place in the young halibut, including the movement of the left eye to the right side of the fish. During this time, the young halibut rise to the surface and are carried to shallower water by prevailing currents. At six months, the halibut has its adult form and is about long. In the shallower water, young halibut then begin life as bottom dwellers. Most young halibut ultimately spend from five to seven years in rich, shallow nursery grounds such as the Bering Sea. Young halibut are highly migratory and generally migrate in a clockwise direction east and south throughout the Gulf of Alaska. Halibut in older age classes tend to be less migratory, but continue to move predominately on a clockwise direction. Mature fish are also involved in winter spawning migrations towards deeper waters, migrating across several areas in some instances. Research has indicated small, localized spawning populations may occur in deep waters such as in Chatham Straight in northern Southeast Alaska. However, because of the free- floating nature of larvae and subsequent mixing of juvenile halibut from throughout the Gulf of Alaska, only one genetic stock of halibut is known in the northern Pacific. Halibut growth rates vary depending on locations and habitat conditions, but females grow faster than males. The oldest recorded female and male were 55 years old. The largest recorded sport-caught halibut was near Unalaska, AK, in 1996.Bethers, Mike. Pacific Halibut. Alaska Department of Fish & Game. Read Online Accessed 5/23/2010 Length and weight thumb As Pacific halibut grow longer, they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between total length (L, in inches) and total weight (W, in pounds) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: W = cL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant that varies among species.R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996. A weight-length relationship based on a least-squares fit to data published in 2003 by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)Halibut weight/length chart (Imperial) published by the IHPC 2003 suggests, for Pacific halibut, c = 0.00018872 and b = 3.24. This relationship predicts a Pacific halibut will weigh about , a halibut will weigh about , and a halibut will weigh about . Commercial fishing Commercial halibut fishing probably began in 1888 when three sailing ships from New England fished off the coast of Washington. As the industry grew, company-owned steamers carrying several smaller dories, from which the fishing was actually conducted, dominated the halibut industry. Subsequently, smaller boats of schooner design from were used by fishermen. These boats carried crews of five to eight and were specifically designed for halibut fishing. Today, many types of boats are used in the halibut industry. Most of the old-style halibut schooners have been replaced by more versatile craft that may also be used in commercial salmon seine, troll, gill net, and crab fisheries. Halibut gear consists of units of leaded ground line in lengths of referred to as ‚Äúskates‚Äù. Each skate has about 100 hooks attached to it. ‚ÄúGangens‚Äù, or the lines to which the hooks are attached, are either tied to or snapped onto the ground line. A ‚Äúset‚Äù consists of one or more baited skates tied together and laid on the ocean bottom with anchors at each end. Each end has a float line with a buoy attached. Hooks are typically baited with frozen herring, octopus, or other fresh fish. Depending on the fishing ground, depth, time of year, and bait used, a set is pulled two to 20 hours after being fished. Longlines are normally pulled off the ocean floor by a hydraulic puller of some type. The halibut are cleaned soon after being boated and are kept on ice to retain freshness. Homer, Alaska, claims the title of \\"Halibut Capital of the World\\" because of the large volume of both sport and commercial halibut fishing in the area. In 2018 the International Pacific Halibut Commission set the catch limit at 2,823.18 tonnes, of which 2,402.25 tonnes was for commercial fisheries and 420.93 tonnes for recreational fisheries. Sport fishing Sport fishing for halibut in Alaska is a very popular activity; it is a strong fighter and one of the world's largest bony fish with an impressive yield of firm, white flesh. Over 65% of the effort and harvest occurs in Cook Inlet, southeast Alaska, the Kodiak area, and near the mouth of Deep Creek in the Lower Cook Inlet. Halibut taken by anglers are generally in weight; but fish over are regularly caught. The current Alaska state record for a sport-caught halibut is , and a fish must weigh at least to qualify for the state's trophy fish program. Anglers use stout saltwater gear to harvest halibut. Most anglers prefer to fish with bait, especially herring, but also squid, octopus, cod pieces, or other small bottom fish. To get the bait down to the halibut, it is usually fished on a wire spreader or a sliding-sinker rig with sinker size to , depending on such factors as depth and current. Halibut, along with salmon, provide sustenance for several Pacific Coast native groups. Many of these groups smoke and dry the halibut for winter use. Sportsmen's effort and interest in catching these fish is increasing each year. In southeast Alaska, halibut are second only to king salmon in sport angler preference. Fishing for Pacific halibut is regulated by the International Pacific Halibut Commission. Members from the United States and Canada meet yearly to review research, check the progress of the commercial fishery, and make regulations for the next fishing season. The management of halibut fishing by this commission is intended to allow a sustainable yield.

The crowded deportees were being transported to CƒÉlƒÉra≈üi without water or food. Many of them had died before reaching Roman, on the trip from Ia≈üi (which normally took two hours). The transport they were on, supervised by the Gendarmerie, has been described as a \\"death train\\". The Gendarmes, instigated by Second Lieutenant Aurel Triandaf and the non-commissioned officer Anastase Bratu, prevented passengers access to water and shot several of those who attempted to procure it.David Cesarani, Holocaust: Critical Concepts in Historical Studies, Routledge, London, 2004, p.498-499 In parallel, various local people and soldiers made attempts to sell the victims water at exorbitant prices, while troops, both local and German, attacked the prisoners with stones. Taking advantage of her position, Agarici asked and received permission to give food and water to the passengers, to allow them to wash, and to remove of the dead bodies. This first aid operation was accomplished with assistance from Romanian Red Cross and local Jewish volunteers, and effectively stalled the transport a full day. According to one account, Agarici actually ordered the authorities to obey -- a Colonel Eraclide possibly complied due to the respect he may have had for Agarici's son. On July 4, all Jewish prisoners were moved to another train, where they received some food and water (despite the improved conditions, 75 died during the subsequent trip and 69 shortly after). Of 2,530 people forcefully embarked in Ia≈üi, only 1,011 were still alive in CƒÉlƒÉra≈üi.

He also served three terms in the Georgia General Assembly, two in the House of Representatives, and one in the Senate. Mitchell resigned from the governorship in 1817 to accept an appointment by President James Monroe as United States Indian Agent to the Creek Nation in their lands in present-day Georgia and Alabama. He followed the more than two-decade tenure of Benjamin Hawkins. In 1820 he was prosecuted for being involved in smuggling of American slaves from Spanish Florida. He was replaced in 1821 by President Monroe, who appointed John Crowell. Early life Mitchell was born in Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland, on October 22, 1766. As a young man, he inherited land in Georgia from his late uncle. He moved to Georgia in 1782 after the American Revolutionary War to Savannah, Georgia to claim it.\\"David Brydie Mitchell,\\" This Day in Georgia History: April 22, Ed Jackson and Charly Pou, Carl Vinson Institute of Government, The University of Georgia, accessed February 14, 2012 Enthusiastic about the new country, Mitchell read the law with established attorneys and passed the bar.

Mitchell married Jane Mills in 1792, and according to family records the couple had six children: William, John, Sara, Edward, Mary, and David II. Political career Mitchell was appointed as Attorney General of Georgia (1796‚Äì1806). He moved to Mount Nebo Plantation, near the state capital of Milledgeville. He served three terms in the Georgia General Assembly, two as a representative and one in the Senate. Mitchell was elected to two consecutive two-year terms as the 27th Governor of Georgia (1809‚Äì1813) and a third non-consecutive term from 1815 to 1817. He resigned from his third term as governor to accept appointment by President James Monroe as the U.S. agent to the Creek Indians. One of Mitchell's responsibilities was the negotiation of the Treaty of the Creek Agency (1818), by which the Creek ceded land to the United States. He was accused in the American Importation Case of 1820 of smuggling slaves into Creek and US territory, in violation of the 1808 law against the American slave trade. While his direct responsibility remains controversial, Mitchell allowed those engaged in this illegal activity to seek refuge for their captives at the agency he supervised along the Flint River. The incident resulted in a major inquiry and his dismissal by President James Monroe in 1821. Beginning in 1828, Mitchell was appointed to serve as the inferior court judge of Baldwin County, Georgia. He was later elected as Baldwin County's State Senator in 1836.

The monastery has been an important spiritual centre for the Seto people.  History  The monastery was founded in the mid-15th century, when the first hermits settled in local caves. The first cave Church of the Dormition of the Theotokos (—Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å –£—Å–ø–µ–Ω–∏—è –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü—ã) was built in 1473 (its modern facade was constructed in the 18th century).

After the monastery had been destroyed by the Livonian feudals, it was rebuilt by a Pskovian dyak Mikhail Munekhin-Misyur in 1519. A posad (settlement) was built next to the monastery, which would later grow into a town. In 1550s-1560s, Pskovo- Pechorsky Monastery and its posad were surrounded by a wall with towers (eventually, these fortifications were rebuilt in 1701). The monastery became an important outpost for defending the western border of Russia. In 1581‚Äì1582, it withstood the siege laid by Stefan Batory‚Äôs army. In 1611‚Äì1616, the monastery repelled the attack of the Polish army led by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Aleksander J√≥zef Lisowski and Swedish army led by Gustav II Adolf. As a fortification Pskovo-Pechersky Monastery lost its importance after the Great Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721. In 1920‚Äì1944, Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery belonged to Estonia. The monastery was one of the few acting male monasteries in the USSR, having been saved from destruction by Pechory being Estonian territory before World War II. In Soviet times, famous Russian mystic Sampson Sievers briefly lived and served in the monastery. Since the fall of the Soviet Union the monastery has flourished. Currently the monastic community numbers over 90 who through their pastoral labors live the tradition of asceticism and eldership as witnessed recently by the Archimandrite John (Krestiankin). In 2013 the monastery marked the 540th anniversary of its existence. In 2011 a book by one of its former inhabitants Archimandrite Tikhon (Shevkunov) Everyday Saints and Other Stories, reflecting the Monastery's life, appeared. Over a million copies were printed and over 3 million digital copies sold worldwide by 2012. In 2012 its English translation won a first prize at New York‚Äôs Read Russia 2012 Festival. Its translator Julian Henry Lowenfeld was baptized into the Orthodox faith that same year, on Holy Saturday, in Moscow's Sretensky Monastery, where Archimandrite Tikhon was hegumen at the time.–ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω –ü–æ—Å–ø–µ–ª–æ–≤. ¬´–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ ‚Äî –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—Ç—å –º—É—Ä–∞—à–∫–∏!¬ª // –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏–µ.Ru.

In 1994 Radchenko founded the now- defunct political party Power to the People (Vlast narodu). During the February 2001 elections to the Republic of Moldova Parliament his party advocated participation of Transnistrians at those elections and campaigned for the Moldova Communist Party.

His party was twice banned for short periods. Alexander Radchenko participated in the 9 December 2001 Transnistrian presidential election, running against the incumbent Igor Smirnov and Tom Zenovich. Of the three candidates, he came last with just under five percent of the votes. Between 2000 and 2005 he was a member of parliament but he failed to win re-election on 11 December 2005.

Biography Born Mary Anne Stewart in Spanish Town, Jamaica, she was the eldest daughter of Walter Steward, Island Secretary of Jamaica. She was educated in England, and in 1852 married Captain George Robert Barker of the Royal Artillery, with whom she would have two children. When Barker was knighted for his leadership at the Siege of Lucknow, Mary Anne became \\"Lady Barker\\". Eight months later Barker died. On 21 June 1865, Mary Anne Barker married Frederick Napier Broome. The couple then sailed for New Zealand, leaving her two children in England. The couple's first child was born in Christchurch in February 1866, but died in May. By this time, they had moved to the sheep station Steventon, which Broome had partnered with H. P. Hill to buy. They remained there for three years; they lost more than half their sheep in the winter of 1867, and in response Broome sold out and the couple returned to London. Both Mary Anne and her husband then became journalists. Still calling herself \\"Lady Barker\\", Mary Anne Broome became a correspondent for The Times, and also published two books of verse, Poems from New Zealand (1868) and The Stranger from Seriphos (1869). In 1870, she published her first book Station Life in New Zealand, a collection of her letters home. The book was reasonably successful, going through several editions and being translated into French and German. Over the next eight years, Lady Barker wrote ten more books, including A Christmas Cake in Four Quarters (1871), a sequel to Station Life entitled Station Amusements in New Zealand (1873), and First Lessons in the Principles of Cooking (1874). This last title led to her being appointed Lady Superintendent of the National Training School of Cooking in South Kensington. When Frederick Broome was appointed Colonial Secretary of Natal in 1875, Lady Barker accompanied him there. Broome's subsequent colonial appointments had him traveling to Mauritius, Western Australia, Barbados, and Trinidad. Drawing on these experiences, Lady Barker published A Year's Housekeeping in South Africa (1880) and Letters to Guy (1885). Frederick Broome was knighted on 3 July 1884, and thereafter Mary Anne called herself \\"Lady Broome\\". She published the last of her 22 books, Colonial Memories under this name. After Sir Frederick Broome's death in 1896, Lady Broome returned to London, dying there on 6 March 1911.

It is named for drummer Sanford A. Moeller, as described in his book The Art of Snare Drumming, also called The Moeller Book. It is believed that he described the method after observing drummers who had fought in the Civil War in the 19th century. Moeller was impressed at their ability to play at high volumes for long periods without tiring. He later taught the system to Jim Chapin in 1938 and 1939. Chapin worked to popularize this method until his death in 2009. Whipping motion The technique uses a specific \\"whipping motion,\\" also sometimes referred to as a \\"wave motion,\\"Beck, John H. Encyclopedia of Percussion. Routledge, 2013. that uses gravity and a dual- fulcrum motion to do the work, allowing the drummer to play faster, and louder, by staying relaxed. It has been promoted as requiring significantly less effort and carrying less risk of injury than other methods. Chapin asserts in his video that the technique does not rely on the rebound - that the drummer must master the hand motion while playing each note as an actual stroke, while Dave Weckl in another video says that it does rely on the rebound. Strokes The Moeller Method uses the whipping motion, described above, and applies it to the 4 basic strokes of drumming, the Full, Up, Down, and Tap strokes.https://www.howtoplaydrums.com/moeller-method/ Using a combination of the basic strokes, in the whipping Moeller style it is possible to play extremely quickly with minimal effort, or to introduce a series of accents into a stream of notes with relative ease.https://www.freedrumlessons.com/articles/moeller-method.php Moeller strokes are often grouped into doubles, using alternating Up and Down strokes, and triples, using Down, Tap, and Up strokes in succession.https://www.electronicdrumadvisor.com/moeller-technique/ In practice, any combination of strokes can be used to play any rhythm or accent pattern needed.https://www.notsomoderndrummer.com/not-so-modern- drummer/2019/4/18/is-the-moeller-method-wrong-for-todays-drumming Grips The Moeller book discusses two different right hand grips for traditional grip: the little finger or vintage grip, and the modern thumb fulcrum grip. The pinky fulcrum is pictured on page 4 of his book. His two-grip concept, missed and overlooked by many, was pointed out by Moeller advocate Tommy William Hanson, in a 2004 online article reviewing Moeller's book. Gripping the right drumstick with the little finger was normally associated with \\"ancient style\\" drumming, aka a pre-1920s grip style that was normally taught to military drummers going back to the American Revolution. The \\"vintage\\" grip consisted of pressing or gripping the drumstick predominately with the little finger. The other fingers would then be curled gently around the drumstick without pressing tightly. With this approach, the fulcrum is situated at the back of the hand. This allows for less vibration to be imparted to the hand during a loud stroke. In contrast, the thumb fulcrum right hand grip (the second recognized grip in The Moeller Book) works better for a jazz drum set, rendering closed rolls and playing cymbal rhythms that require a more delicate touch. The left hand grip that Moeller advocates is an open, loose grip.https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/february-2018-moeller-through- chapin-lens/ This contrasts with the \\"band and orchestra\\" grip popular in his era, which was closed and stiff. It is also entirely different, and more relaxed than the Alan Dawson \\"thumb back\\" grip and less thumb-centered than the Scottish \\"thumb on top\\" grip.

The allegations against Muslim Dost, in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, was that he was a member of the Jamaat al Dawa al Quran (JDQ) militant group, and served as a contact between that group and Al Qaeda. Muslim Dost acknowledged being a member of JDQ, but said he joined long ago, during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Muslim Dost's brother was also a journalist; was also a held in extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo; was also released by the Americans following his Tribunal. Their presence in Guantanamo was discussed in the press prior the Department of Defense released the official list of detainee identities. He has been noted for his poetry while detained by the American government and the lengths he went through to record it, ranging from scratching with a spoon onto polystyrene teacups to using rubbery pens, and has received much esteem in this regard. His account on his stay at Guantanamo, The Broken Chains, is currently being translated into English. =Determined not to have been an enemy combatant= Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost was one of the 38 captives the Bush Presidency determined had not been enemy combatants after all. The Department of Defense refers to these men as No Longer Enemy Combatants. Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost was freed on April 20, 2005 with sixteen other Afghans whose Tribunals had determined they were not enemy combatants. The Associated Press reported that their release ceremony was addressed by Afghan Chief Justice Fazl Hadi Shinwari. Carlotta Gall of The New York Times reported that the Chief Justice encouraged the men to regard their detention as something sent from God. The reports stated that the Chief Justice warned the cleared men that a candid description of their detention could damage the chances of other Afghan captives to be released. Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost was one of the three captives who chose to address the Press. Carlotta Gall described him as openly disagreeing with the Chief Justice as to whether any Afghans should have been sent to Guantanamo: Both reports quoted Chief Justice Fazil Hadi Shinwari distinguishing three categories of captives: =Combatant Status Review Tribunal= thumbCombatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a trailer the size of a large RV.

Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status. Subsequently, the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants‚Äîrather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant. =Summary of Evidence memo= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Abdul Rahim Muslimdost's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, on 29 September 2004. The memo listed the following allegations against him: =Transcript= Muslimdost chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. On March 3, 2006, in response to a court order from Jed Rakoff the Department of Defense published a sixteen-page summarized transcript from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. According to Fox News, the US considered Muslim Dost \\"too old and sick to get back in the fight\\" and his intelligence value had been \\"maxed out\\". 2006 Pakistan arrest On September 30, 2006 the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Muslim Dost had been arrested by Pakistani officials.Pakistan arrests freed Guantanamo Afghan scholar, Xinhua, September 30, 2006 The article quotes Muslim Dost's brother, who linked the arrest to criticisms of the Inter- Services Intelligence Directorate's role in the capture of Guantanamo detainees. Muslim Dost's brother said he was arrested while leaving his Mosque. Local Peshawar Police Superintendent Iftikhar Khan denied any knowledge of Muslim Dost's arrest, but acknowledged Inter-Services Intelligence officials may have executed a covert arrest. In 2008, Muslim Dost was released from detention as part of a prisoner swap between the Pakistani Government and the Pakistani Taliban, who had been holding Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan and others hostage. Affiliation with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant In July 2014, Abdul Raheem Muslim Dost swore allegiance to the leader of ISIL, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and began recruiting fighters and distributing propaganda for its Khorasan branch in the Nuristan and Kunar provinces of Afghanistan, parts of the Afghan-Pakistan tribal belt, and in some Afghan refugee camps in Peshawar. In a video released in 2014, Dost claimed to have had a vision about the reestablishment of the Caliphate, while in an interview with a journalist, Dost admitted being a supporter of the group, while denying reports he held an influential position in it. In late 2015, Dost publicly disassociated himself from ISIL in Khorasan, condemning the group's leadership and killings in Afghanistan. He reportedly maintained his allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his self-proclaimed Caliphate.

He was born in the village of Hochfeld, Principality of Transylvania, Austrian Empire (today Fofeldea as part of Nocrich, Romania). He was a participant in the 1848 revolution, an organizer of the Romanian school and one of the founding members of the Romanian Academy. Laurian was a member of the Latinist School, a mainly-Transylvanian movement in the Romanian culture which promoted the idea that Romanians are pure Romans, whose history was a continuation of the history of the Roman Empire.Boia p.87 His book on History of the Romanians began with the Foundation of Rome in 753 BC and after the demise of Rome, it continues with the history of the Romanians, with all dates being converted to the Roman system, Ab urbe condita. Thus, in his book it is written that Vladimirescu's rebellion occurred in the year 2574 AUC.Boia p.46‚Äì47 Because of this alleged continuity, he supported the purification of the Romanian language by stripping it of non-Latin elements and attempting to bring it as close to Latin as possible. Between 1871 and 1876, Laurian collaborated with Ioan Massim for a two-volume Romanian language dictionary, commissioned by the Romanian Academy. The dictionary was stripped of non-Latin words, including neologisms as replacements for such words, which were supposed to be eliminated from the language. The dictionary was also written in an etymological spelling system, the result being an artificial language which only vaguely resembled Romanian and it provoked laughter, discrediting the Latinist school.

It is an affluent residential area that was built over the sands of a beach where the Gobela Creek died into a diffuse delta at the mouth of the Estuary of Bilbao in the early 20th century. It is connected to Portugalete at the other side of the firth by the Vizcaya Bridge transporter bridge and offers a marina, a small beach that can unfortunately be polluted, and a monument to Evaristo Churruca, who planned and directed the channelization of the estuary. The Vizcaya Bridge is now a tourist attraction with visitors able to go by lift to the top of the bridge (from where it was originally operated). Neighbourhoods It can be divided in three neighbourhoods: *Central Areeta, around the Main Street, location of many shops, restaurants and bars. *Santa Ana, a quiet residential area, named after the small church located in the eponymous plaza. *Zugazarte, an area of more affluent homes along a road and park, looking to the sea and neighbouring Neguri. Sometimes the neighbouring district of Erromo is also included in Areeta but this is surely a misuse, as Erromo was built for the working classes and was separated by the suburban railroad until it was recycled by the Metro Bilbao in its subway system and by the canalized Gobela creek. Public transport Public transport to and from the area is provided by Metro Bilbao, with Areeta (Las Arenas) station in the centre of the area flanked by Lamiako (a mainly industrial district) and Gobela (a wealthy residential area), and BizkaiBus, whose yellow buses provide services throughout Biscay. The Barik card can be used on the metro, the bus system, and also to cross the Vizcaya Bridge. A small passenger ferry also operates across the river between Areeta and Portugalete.

The film, based on the best-selling 1939 novel of the same name by Richard Llewellyn, was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and scripted by Philip Dunne. The film stars Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Anna Lee, Donald Crisp, and a very young Roddy McDowall. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, famously beating Citizen Kane, Sergeant York and The Maltese Falcon for Best Picture. It also won Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Supporting Actor. The film tells the story of the Morgans, a hard-working Welsh mining family, from the point of view of the youngest child Huw, who lives with his affectionate and kind parents, and his five brothers, in the South Wales Valleys during the late Victorian era. The story chronicles life in the South Wales coalfields, the loss of that way of life and its effects on the family. The fictional village in the film is based on Gilfach Goch;(February 7, 2009)\\"How Green Was My Valley\\", BBC Radio Wales. Retrieved August 20, 2019. Llewellyn spent many summers there visiting his grandfather, and it served as the inspiration for the novel. In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The Academy Film Archive preserved How Green Was My Valley in 1998. Plot The Welsh mining village of How Green Was My Valley The film begins with a monologue by an older Huw Morgan (voiced by Irving Pichel): \\"I am packing my belongings in the shawl my mother used to wear when she went to the market. And I'm going from my valley. And this time, I shall never return.\\" The valley and its villages are now blackened by the dust of the coal mines that surround the area. A young Huw (Roddy McDowall), the youngest child of Gwilym Morgan (Donald Crisp), walks home with his father to meet his mother, Beth (Sara Allgood). His older brothers, Ianto (John Loder), Ivor (Patric Knowles), Davy (Richard Fraser), Gwilym Jr. (Evan S. Evans), and Owen (James Monks) all work in the coal mines with their father, while sister Angharad (Maureen O'Hara) keeps house with their mother. Huw's childhood is idyllic, the town, not yet overrun with mining spoil, is beautiful, and the household is warm and loving, the miners sing as they walk home (in this case Bread of Heaven in Welsh). The wages are collected, the men wash then eat together. Afterwards the spending money is given out. Huw is smitten on meeting Bronwyn (Anna Lee), a girl engaged to be married to his eldest brother, Ivor (Patric Knowles). At the boisterous wedding party Angharad meets the new preacher, Mr. Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon), and there is an obvious mutual attraction. Trouble begins when the mine owner decreases wages, and the miners strike in protest. Gwilym's attempt to mediate by not endorsing a strike estranges him from the other miners as well as his older sons, who quit the house. Beth interrupts a late night meeting of the strikers, threatening to kill anyone who harms her husband. While returning home, crossing the fields in a snowstorm in the dark, Beth falls into the river. Huw dives in to save her with the help of the townspeople, and temporarily loses the use of his legs. He recovers with the help of Mr. Gruffydd, which further endears the latter to Angharad. The strike is eventually settled, and Gwilym and his sons reconcile, yet many miners have lost their jobs. Angharad is courted by the mine owner's son, Iestyn Evans (Marten Lamont), though she loves Mr. Gruffydd. Mr. Gruffydd loves her too, to the malicious delight of the gossipy townswomen, but cannot bear to subject her to an impoverished churchman's life. Angharad submits to a loveless marriage to Evans, and they relocate out of the country. Huw begins school at a nearby village. Abused by other boys, he is taught to fight by boxer Dai Bando (Rhys Williams) and his crony, Cyfartha (Barry Fitzgerald). After a beating by the cruel teacher Mr. Jonas (Morton Lowry), Dai Bando avenges Huw with an impromptu boxing display on Mr. Jonas to the delight of his pupils. On the day that Bronwyn gives birth to their child, Ivor is killed in a mine accident. Later, two of Morgan's sons are dismissed in favor of less experienced, cheaper laborers. With no job prospects, they leave to seek their fortunes abroad. Huw is awarded a scholarship to university, but to his father's dismay he refuses it to work in the mines. He relocates with Bronwyn, to help provide for her and her child. When Angharad returns without her husband, vicious gossip of an impending divorce spreads through the town. Mr. Gruffydd is denounced by the church deacons, and after condemning the town's small-mindedness, he decides to leave. Just then, the alarm whistle sounds, signalling another mine disaster. Several men are injured, and Gwilym and others are trapped in a cave-in. Young Huw, Mr. Gruffydd, and Dai Bando descend with others for a rescue attempt. Gwilym and his son are briefly re- united before he succumbs to his injuries. Huw rides the lift to the surface cradling his father's body, his coal-blackened face devoid of youthful innocence. Narration by an older Huw recalls, \\"Men like my father cannot die. They are with me still, real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved forever. How green was my valley then.\\" The movie ends with a montage of family vignettes showing Huw with his father and mother, his brothers and sister.

William Wyler, the original director, saw the screen test of McDowall and chose him for the part. Wyler was replaced by John Ford. Fox wanted to shoot the movie in Wales in Technicolor, but it was impossible to do so during World War II. Instead, Ford had the studio build an 80-acre authentic replica of a Welsh mining town at Brent's Crags (subsequently Crags Country Club) in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California. The cast had only one Welsh actor, Rhys Williams, in a minor role. Reception Alternate \\"Style B\\" theatrical poster How Green Was My Valley maintains a 90% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.04/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Though it perhaps strays into overly maudlin territory, this working-class drama is saved by a solid cast and director John Ford's unmistakeable style.\\" Tim Dirks of Filmsite.org lauded the film as \\"one of John Ford's masterpieces of sentimental human drama.\\" While the opinion among the Academy Awards committee that it was 1941's Best Picture has been disputed by some later critics, How Green Was My Valley continues to be well received in its own right and, in 1990, was added to the American National Film Registry. Academy Award-winning actor and director Clint Eastwood named it as one of his favorite movies. Awards =Academy Awards= ;Winners *Best Picture - Darryl F.

Williams) is an American singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist of New Orleans-based sludge metal band Eyehategod. Williams is the former associate editor of heavy metal magazine Metal Maniacs and has also worked on other projects.

Album credits. have featured his vocals which have been described as \\"tortured laryngitis screams\\", an \\"indecipherable ranting\\", and \\"the utmost sickening, puke-ridden audio atrocities that could actually prove deadly if taken in large doses\\". For the recording of Dopesick, Eyehategod's third album, Williams went through several issues. At the time he was living in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn in New York City so he had to travel between there and New Orleans, Louisiana frequently for the recording sessions,Williams, Mike. Dopesick. Recording notes on the 2007 European reedition. Century Media Records. which took place at Side One Studios. He attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process, Williams slashed his hand open badly and bled all over the studio floor. One of the band members then apparently smeared the words \\"Hell\\" and \\"Death to Pigs\\" in his blood. The studio owner reportedly called Century Media to ask if the band were insane, and threatened to kick them out because of this. =Role in the band= The band's lyrics and themes are completely conceived by Williams. He always has lyrics written by him ready so when the other members of the band send him songs he just decides which lyrics he wants for each song. His lyrics never try to portray anything, they never have a story attached to them. Sometimes he works with the musical atmosphere created by his partners in Eyehategod. Other projects During his first years as an Eyehategod member, Williams was in two other bands. Drip, a sludge metal band, which also featured fellow Eyehategod band members Jimmy Bower and Brian Patton, and Crawlspace. In 2006, he began a hardcore punk band along with Phil Anselmo named Arson Anthem. He's the band's singer. Williams stated on 2008 that his desire with this band is that it makes people explore early hardcore punk, what he listened to when he had no responsibility and used to ride on his skateboard. Along with all Eyehategod members except Jimmy Bower he formed Outlaw Order, another sludge metal band. He provides vocals for the band. In 2005, Williams' first book, Cancer as a Social Activity, was released. The book includes old lyrics and portions of collages that Williams assembled for Eyehategod which date back as far as 1988 as well as unreleased stuff, written during the period of two or three years before the release of the book. The book also shows Eyehategod's history. It was mostly written in New Orleans and New York City but there are also part which were written while he was travelling. Early 2013 saw the emergence of Corrections House, an industrial project involving Williams plus members of Neurosis, Nachtmystium, and Yakuza. Hurricane Katrina and jail When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, on August 29, 2005, Williams was at his home in the Lower Garden District with his then-girlfriend. About eight hours after the beginning of the storm the power went out. By listening to battery powered radio announcements they were able to find out that the situation in New Orleans was quite bad. After the hurricane passed, the water in Williams' neighborhood subsided. At this time violence and crime in the area became rampant and the police were not in a position to help the residents. In the 2020 book Raising Hell: Backstage Tales from the Lives of Metal Legends, Williams stated he looted a pharmacy after the hurricane and \\"didn't get busted until three days later.\\" Inside the house they could hear gunshots and at one time, upon leaving the apartment, Williams' partner was confronted by a person who attempted to rob her. Williams intervened on her behalf. In order to escape the violence, Williams and his partner slept at the apartment of a friend. The following morning they borrowed a car and traveled to Morgan City, Louisiana, where Williams received word that his house had burned down. They booked a hotel room in Morgan City. Apparently, the person who attended them could see they were from New Orleans because they had to show their identity document; for unknown reasons this person contacted the police. Members of the police entered Williams room and arrested him. Williams was then convicted of drug possession and jailed. Bail was set at $150,000; an amount Williams was unable to afford. With help from his lawyer Williams filed for a bond reduction which was rejected by the court on the grounds that Williams was a threat to society. Williams was anxious at this time as his friends and associates were unaware that he was in prison. A fund to help to free Williams was created and his bandmates encouraged fans to send letters to him while he was in jail. Later, Phil Anselmo paid the bail money to have Williams released. Upon his release Williams spent several months staying at Anselmo's home. Personal life He was born in High Point, North Carolina. His parents died when he was a child. At the age of 15, he left home. During most part of his life he has lived in New Orleans, Louisiana but he also lived some time in New York City. He has always suffered from asthma. He used to be the associate editor of Metal Maniacs. =Drug addiction= Williams struggled with drug addiction before Hurricane Katrina. By the time the hurricane hit, he had stopped using heroin and was in a methadone program. During his stay in prison he did not receive the substance so he couldn't sleep for about seven days. He hardly ate for six days; he just soaked the bread from lunch in water and swallowed it because he knew he needed to keep something down. After this, he wasn't addicted to opiates anymore. Jimmy Bower stated in an interview that Mike inspired him to kick opiates also.

In 2009, president Igor Smirnov appointed a constitutional commission, which has proposed some controversial constitutional changes.Yevgeny Shevchuk, \\"I call on you all to unite to protect our future, where there is the rule of law, the strong people are just, the weak people are protected, and everyone works and maintains stability‚Äù. The stated purpose of the new constitution is to harmonize Transnistrian legislation with that of its main guarantor state, Russia. Among the proposed changes is the introduction of a bicameral legislature (of which the lower house is to be elected and the upper house to be appointed) and the abolition of elections for rural administrations. An official draft was published on 11 September 2009. Smirnov sent the draft to parliament on 23 October. A referendum was planned for 24 January 2010, but the proposal failed in parliament on 18 November. The draft is now to be amended once more.

The SAR has three major rail gauges: 1600 mm (5 ft 3 in); 1435 mm (4 ft in); and 1067 mm (3 ft 6 in). History Y71 steam locomotive on display at the Western Australian Rail Transport Museum The horsedrawn Goolwa to Port Elliot railway, in 1860 =Colonial period= The first railway in South Australia was laid in 1854 between Goolwa and Port Elliot to allow for goods to be transferred between paddle steamers on the Murray River and seagoing vessels. The next railway was laid from the harbour at Port Adelaide to the colony, and was laid with Irish gauge track. This line was opened in 1856. Later on, branch lines in the state's north in the mining towns of Kapunda and Burra were linked through to the Adelaide metropolitan system. From here, a south main line extended to meet the horse tramway from Victor Harbor to Strathalbyn, and towards the South Australia/Victoria Border. With the metropolitan systems being broad gauge, the mid north and south east of the state were originally laid with narrow gauge track. These systems were closely based on British practice, as was the broad gauge system prior to 1926. Locomotives and rolling stock were bought from the United Kingdom and United States, from builders such as Beyer, Peacock & Company, D√ºbs and Company, North British Locomotive Company, and Baldwin Locomotive Works. Nine broad gauge tank locomotives plus the frame of a tenth were bought second-hand from the Canterbury Provincial Railways in New Zealand when it converted to narrow gauge. =Rehabilitation= William Webb, who transformed South Australian Railways in the 1920s In 1922, after the SAR's worst financial deficit, the government appointed American railroad manager William Webb, from the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad as Chief Commissioner. When Webb arrived in Adelaide with his young family, he found a railway system unchanged since the late 19th century. The locomotives and rolling stock were small, wagons and carriages were of wooden construction, the track and bridges were unsuitable for heavy loads, the workshops had antiquated machinery and the signalling system was inflexible. These attributes drove up the ratio of operating costs to revenue. Webb introduced a rehabilitation plan based on American railroad principles of large, standardised locomotives and steel bodied freight wagons, with automatic couplers to enable a significant increase in productivity. Lightly patronised passenger trains would be replaced by self-propelled rail cars, enabling faster, more frequent and more efficient services. He recruited Fred Shea as his Chief Mechanical Engineer and had him prepare specifications for this new equipment. This resulted in orders being placed for 1,200 wagons of four types from American Car and Foundry, 12 petrol mechanical railmotor cars from the Service Motors Corporation, Wabash, Indiana, and 30 locomotives based on American Locomotive Company plans but built by Armstrong Whitworth & Co in the United Kingdom. These were of the Mountain, Pacific and Mikado wheel arrangements, 10 of each type, which became the 500, 600, and 700 class locomotives.David Burke. Kings of the Iron Horse. Methuen. 1985. p118-121. To carry the heavier trains, the rehabilitation plan included the strengthening of track and bridges, and the conversion of the mid north narrow gauge system (the Western division) to broad gauge. The antiquated Islington Railway Workshops were demolished and replaced with a thoroughly modern railway maintenance and manufacturing works, a large new round house was built at Mile End, near Adelaide, and several 85 foot turntables were installed throughout the state to enable the much larger locomotives to be turned. Efficient train operations were facilitated by the adoption of American train order working on country lines, and Adelaide railway station was replaced with an imposing new building, opened in 1927. This grand building has been partially taken over by the Adelaide Casino. 500 class locomotive introduced by Webb to haul heavy trains over the Adelaide Hills When the two shiploads of new locomotives arrived in 1926 they caused a sensation with the public and throughout the railway industry in Australia. The 500 class \\"Mountain\\" was over twice the size of the biggest pre-Webb engine, and was the most powerful locomotive in Australia. Henceforth double heading broad gauge trains became a rarity in South Australia. The massive locomotives were unloaded at Port Adelaide and taken off the pier by horses (the locomotives weight alone exceeding the dock's maximum loading capacity). Apart from some initial teething problems (mainly to do with overheating bearings and rough riding due to excessive play allowed on driving axles) the new locomotives settled in nicely to their assigned positions. After the success of the original locomotives, ten more 700 class locomotives, with larger tenders, were locally built using the facilities of the new Islington Workshops. These were the 710 class. The 500 class was rated to haul 400 tons over the Mount Lofty Ranges immediately east of Adelaide, where a continuous 1-in-45 (2.2%) gradient faced trains heading for Victoria. Two years after their introduction, the class was modified by the addition of a booster engine which required replacement of the two-wheel trailing truck with a four-wheel truck. This altered the wheel arrangement from 4-8-2 to 4-8-4, but the term \\"Mountains\\" stuck with the locomotives. Reclassified 500B class, their maximum load to Mount Lofty was increased to 600 tons, or eleven passenger cars. In the pre-Webb era the Rx class - a 4-6-0 with a Belpaire firebox was rated at 190 tons for this line, with three of them required to lift a heavy Melbourne Express - two at the front and one banking from the rear.Douglas Colquhoun et al. 500: The 4-8-2 and 4-8-4 Locomotives of the South Australian Railways. Australian Railways Historical Society. 1969. pp. 4, 11, 15-16 The broad gauge system was the main focus of Webb rehabilitation scheme. The narrow gauge systems north of Terowie and on the Eyre Peninsula remained untouched, as did the gauge South Eastern division (although it was subsequently converted to broad gauge in the early 1950s). Webb decided not to extend his contract in 1930 and returned to the US, having revolutionised the SAR. =Post-depression period= In 1936 for the centenary year of the state, a fleet of ten new 620 class Pacific type locomotives were introduced. These locomotives, with streamlining based on that of the London & North East Railway's P2 class Cock O' the North locomotive, were able to traverse branch lines laid with 60-pound rail, as well as the mainline 80-pound rail, and were used to power the East-West Express between Adelaide and Port Pirie from 1937, after the extension of the broad gauge line north from Red Hill. Concurrently, the Commonwealth Railways extended its standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway line south from Port Augusta, and a new transfer station was opened at Port Pirie Junction.Burke, Ibid Other additions to the big power locomotive fleet after the Depression included the 720 class, Berkshires based around the 700 and 710 class locomotives, the 740 class based around the 700 class, and the 520, a modern light lines locomotive, styled after the Pennsylvania Railroad T1, and more than able to handle all mainline passenger services except the heaviest services over the Mount Lofty Ranges. In June 1949, two 350 class diesel locomotives, built by the SAR's Islington Railway Workshops with a Bo-Bo wheel arrangement, entered service.Broad Gauge 350-class diesel locomotives Chris' Commonwealth Railways Pages SAR 900 class diesel-electric locomotive, built by the SAR and also designed for the demanding Adelaide Hills route, entered service in 1951 The first mainline diesel locomotives to enter service were the 900 class in 1951, also built by Islington Railway Workshops. The SAR then turned to American Locomotive Company products with the 930, 830, 600 and 700 classes manufactured in Sydney by AE Goodwin. In the 1950s, railcars were introduced, the Redhens for Adelaide suburban services and the Bluebirds for regional services. As part of the Sydney-Perth standard gauge link, the Port Pirie-Broken Hill railway line was converted to standard gauge while the Roseworthy-Peterborough line north of Terowie was converted from narrow to broad gauge in 1970. In the 1972 election, the Whitlam Federal Government made a commitment to invite the states to hand over their railway systems to the federal government. The Government of South Australia took up the offer, but elected to retain the Adelaide metropolitan services that were transferred to the State Transport Authority. Financial responsibility for the remaining services passed to the Federal Government on 1 July 1975, although the SAR continued to operate services until operations were formally transferred on 1 March 1978 to Australian National.Australian National Railways Amendment Act 1978 Government of Australia Steam Locomotives =Broad Gauge= =Narrow Gauge= Diesel Locomotives & Railcars Commissioner of Railways South Australian Railways Commissioner John A.

Its programs represent efforts to protect the press as well as to promote professional and ethical values in journalistic practice. CMFR logo  History  The formation of the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) addresses one of the critical concerns confronting the Philippines after People Power toppled the Marcos dictatorship in February 1986. That concern called attention to the power of the media and the role of the free press in the development of Philippine democracy. All over the world, press freedom has been found to be essential to the democratic system. Effective participatory government is possible only when it can count on a well-informed society where individuals freely exchange ideas, and public debate and discussion arise from knowledge and understanding of national affairs. That freedom involves not only media professionals, but also the public served by the media‚Äîpublic officials, the private sector, civil society groups, readers, viewers, and listeners‚Äîwho receive information and are a part of the cycle of public communication. But freedom of the press, like all liberties, has its limits, for the simplest reason that it is vulnerable to abuse. Democratic recovery confronts serious obstacles on the media front. The press and the media need to exert special efforts to measure up a collective vehicle of information, and as an instrument for clarifying complex issues and dilemmas of development that the public should understand. Against this background, CMFR was organized in 1989 as a private, non-stock, non-profit organization involving the different sectors of society in the task of building up the press and news media as a pillar of democratic society. Its programs uphold press freedom, promote responsible journalism, and encourage journalistic excellence.  Objectives  * To protect and strengthen the press as a pillar of democracy * To establish a framework of responsibility and ethics in the practice of the press * To raise levels of competence for coverage of special areas of news * To promote journalistic excellence * To engage different sectors of society in the growth of a quality press in the Philippines * To promote media literacy and create awareness on the public's need for information  Program of Activities  = Media Monitoring = With content analysis, CMFR evaluates media coverage of major issues and events, susch as elections and corruption. Based on its findings, CMFR has recommended measures to improve media performance. In addition to special projects based on content analysis, PJR Reports includes case studies of media performance.  PJR and PJR Reports  The Philippine Journalism Review (PJR), which was previously in magazine form, was revived in 2007 as a refereed journal for students and professors of journalism. PJR Reports is its monthly sister publication addressed to journalism professionals. PJR Reports is not just a publication; it is the result of a continuing monitoring activity of how the press covers and reports events and issues. PJR Reports meets the need for the continuing education of journalists. Sent to over 500 journalists nationwide, PJR Reports also serves as a regular forum for the discussion of the issues and problems of the news media in the Philippines. PJR Reports serves as a reference for journalism faculty and students in universities and colleges. PJR Reports was first released as a quarterly and then as a bimonthly journal. It is now released monthly to make the material more accessible to the public. = Jaime V. Ongpin Awards for Excellence in Journalism (JVOAEJ) = CMFR holds the Jaime V. Ongpin Awards for Excellence in Journalism (JVOAEJ) yearly to promote the practice of investigative journalism and explanatory reporting. These involve basic building blocks for any kind of reporting: research, inquiry, and corroboration to ensure the validity of one‚Äôs findings. CMFR serves as the technical and administrative secretariat of the awards. In 1995, the program initiated the first Jaime V. Ongpin Journalism Seminar on Investigative Journalism in order to broaden public interest and support for the development of investigative journalism. The seminar, now known as the Jaime V. Ongpin Journalism Seminar, invites journalism students and faculty from different schools to interact with a panel of finalists who discuss their articles and views on journalism. = Freedom Watch = CMFR monitors attacks against and threats to press freedom in the Philippines. It maintains a database of journalists killed in the line of duty and trains a national network of journalists to report on assaults against the press. Correspondents provide updates on unsolved cases of journalists killed and issue calls for action when necessary. CMFR serves as a clearing house for information to international groups. CMFR forwards alerts and reports on the state of press freedom in the PHilippines to the Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA), the International Freedom of Expression eXchange (IFEX), Reporters Without Borders (RSF), and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). = Journalism Asia = A yearly publication that reports on the state of the press and the issues affecting media in Asia. Contributors are media practitioners from the region who gather for a conference (the Journalism Asia Forum) to discuss selected issues that will be taken up in the magazine. = Books and other publications = CMFR also publishes reports and books on major topics of media interest and performance such as media and gender issues and media and governance.

He formed the Five Minutes, also known as Five Men-Its, who quickly garnered regional recognition. Two of the members of the group, drummer Johnny Sandlin and keyboardist Paul Hornsby, would join Duane and Gregg Allman in the Hour Glass and later go on to success as record producers. Hinton, Sandlin and Hornsby all spent time working as session players in Muscle Shoals. Hornsby and Sandlin worked at Rick Hall's FAME Studios (Florence Alabama Music Enterprises) and from there went to Capricorn Records in Macon, Ga. Hinton had joined some former FAME players known as the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (or \\"the Swampers\\") who split off from Hall and started their own studio, Muscle Shoals Sound, in Sheffield. Hinton was replaced at MSS by Wayne Perkins. As a session guitarist in Muscle Shoals, Hinton played on hit records recorded by Wilson Pickett, Arthur Conley, Aretha Franklin, Joe Tex, Solomon Burke, Percy Sledge, The Staple Singers, The Dells, Bonnie Bramlett, Paul Kelly, Johnny Taylor, Elvis Presley, The Box Tops, R. B. Greaves, Boz Scaggs, Evie Sands, Looking Glass, Toots Hibbert and Otis Redding. Hinton was a songwriter in his own right as well. His most well known song is \\"Breakfast in Bed\\" which has been recorded many times, most notably by Dusty Springfield and by UB40 with Chrissie Hynde. He also co-wrote \\"It's All Wrong But It's All Right\\" sung by Laura Lee. Willy Deville recorded his song \\"Help Me To Make It (Power of a Woman's Love)\\" on his album Coup de Gr√¢ce. Legacy and influence The song \\"Sandwiches for the Road\\" by fellow Alabamians Drive-By Truckers is based on the life of Eddie Hinton. It appears on their 1998 debut LP, Gangstabilly. A documentary of the life and musical career of Hinton was made by New Mexico Filmmakers Deryle Perryman and Moises Gonzalez. Narrated by bluesman Robert Cray, Dangerous Highway screened in film festivals across the US and made its European premiere at the 2008 Porretta Soul Festival in Porretta, Italy. Dangerous Highway Beginning in 2009, Shake It Records based in Cincinnati, Ohio, began releasing entries from their series Dangerous Highway: A Tribute to the Music of Eddie Hinton. This series featured cover versions of Hinton's songs by artists who were inspired by and continue his legacy. Volumes one and two were released in 2009. Volume 1 - Greg Dulli Side A - \\"Hard Luck Guy\\"; Side B - \\"Cover Me\\" Volume 2 - Drive-By Truckers Side A - \\"Where's Eddie?\\"; Side B - \\"Everybody Needs Love\\" Volume 3 - Heartless Bastards and Wussy Side A - \\"Got Down Last Saturday Night\\" - Heartless Bastards ; Side B - \\"Breakfast in Bed\\" - Wussy Volume 4 - Buffalo Killers Side A - \\"Heavy Makes You Happy\\"; Side B - \\"Still Water Runs Deep\\" Personal life Hinton was the grandson of a preacher and used his gospel influences to weave stories of pain and redemption. Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler heard Hinton while he was doing session work at Muscle Shoals Sound and deemed him \\"the next big thing.\\" However, Hinton's battles with mental illness, drugs and alcohol addiction prevented that from happening. He died at home with his mother, Deanie Perkins and stepfather, Paul Perkins, in Birmingham, Alabama from a heart attack at age 51.

History  Lifestart began in 1996 when eight families whose children attended the Macquarie University Early Intervention program decided to set up an Early Childhood Intervention service which would be a model of best practice in service provision and family support. They won a tender from the NSW state government which allowed them to set up a small service in Turramurra, and was later named the model program for the state of NSW. The service is now spread right across Sydney, covering Northern Sydney, Western Sydney (including the Hills District), Eastern and Inner Sydney, Southern Sydney (including Illawarra/Shoalhaven), South West Sydney (including Wollondilly/Southern Highlands) and Nepean Blue Mountains (including the Hawkesbury). Lifestart has been funded by the NSW Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care, the NSW Department of Education and Training, and is now a registered NDIS provider. Lifestart is a registered charity and relies on donations for some programs.ALICE SPRINGS YOUTH & ACCOMMODATION SUPPORT  Services  A Lifestart team can provide speech therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology, early intervention, social welfare, transition to school and high school, community inclusion and school support. Services are provided within the home, the child‚Äôs school or daycare, at one of Lifestart‚Äôs centres, or within the community (e.g. supporting inclusion into a swimming program). One of the most important programs is Open Playgroup, a weekly playgroup where parents can meet together and support one another while their children are supported in play by trained staff. This playgroup is open to members of the community and families on the waiting list as well as Lifestart members. Lifestart uses a key worker approach. A key worker is the person you will see and talk to the most.

Okazaki fragments contributed to the understanding of DNA replication. Dr. Tsuneko Okazaki has continued to be involved in academia, contributing to more advancements in DNA research.  Early life and education  Tsuneko Okazaki was born in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan in 1933. She graduated from Aichi Prefectural Asahigaoka Senior High School. During her undergraduate years, she studied biology at Nagoya University School of Science. She graduated with her PhD from Nagoya University School of Science in 1956, which was also the year that she met her husband, Reiji Okazaki. They married that same year and soon after, they joined their research work and laboratories.  Work leading to and discovery of Okazaki Fragments  Tsuneko and Reiji Okazaki's early research consisted of studying DNA synthesis and specific nucleotide characteristics in frog eggs and sea urchins. This work led to the discovery of thymidine-diphosphate rhamnose, a sugar linked nucleotide, which then opened up the doors for them to work in the U.S. They worked at Washington University and Stanford University in the labs of J. L. Strominger and Arthur Kornberg, respectively, where there was a lot more availability of resources to further their research. Years later, after much research done in both the U.S and Japan, in 1968, Tsuneko and Reiji published their breakthrough findings on Okazaki fragments in PNAS. After Reiji Okazaki's early death from Hiroshima-induced leukemia in 1975, Tsuneko continued her research and moved on to proving the structure of the RNA primer associated with Okazaki fragments.  Additional research contributions  Tsuneko has continued to be involved in different research projects up to this day, mainly investigating different aspects of DNA. She has served as head of laboratories, lead academic supervisor of students, and as a significant intellectual contributor. Specifically, her contributions have been on research done on revealing hGCMa as a placenta-specific transcription regulator, possibly involved in the expression of multiple placenta-specific genes. She contributed to research on the human centromere protein B found to induce translational positioning of nucleosomes on Œ±-satellite sequences. She worked on understanding the genomic regulation of HLA-G and how the presence of a LINE1 gene silencer may explain the limited expression of HLA-G. She also contributed to the research on mice with characteristics of down syndrome in order to understand the genotype-phenotype characteristics of down syndrome in humans.  Career involvements  Tsuneko was an associate professor in molecular biology at the School of Science in Nagoya University from 1967 to 1983. She held this position until she became a lead professor from 1983 to 1997. In 1997, she moved to the Institute of Comprehensive Medical Science, Fujita Health University, where she was a professor for five years and then became a visiting professor until 2008. Additionally, throughout the years of 2004 to 2007, her main job was in the Stockholm office, where she was the director of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. She was also CEO/president and director of Chromo Research Inc. from 2008 to 2015.  Family life  In 1963, after coming back from conducting research at Washington and Stanford University along with her husband, Tsuneko had her first child. She then had her second child in 1973. Due to low nursery care in Japan at the time, Tsuneko had difficulty finding help to take care of her children, as she was working full-time with her research. She was part of a citizen's campaign where she marched for more availability of child-care support.[5] Reiji Okazaki died in 1975, but Tsuneko continued working to complete the research they were working on. Recognitions Tsuneko was awarded the L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science in 2000.(2015-04-05) DNA researcher Okazaki wins int'l award for female scientists., the Free Library, Retrieved 2017-10-31. She was also awarded the Medal with Purple Ribbon in 2000, the Order of the Sacred Treasure, [and] Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon in 2008. In 2015, Nagoya University created the Tsuneko and Reiji Okazaki Award, \\"in honor of the spirit and legacy of Professors Okazaki.\\" In 2015, she was elected as a Person of Cultural Merit.

The drug has only weak activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is only useful in preventing resistance to more powerful drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin. It is never used on its own to treat tuberculosis; it is used in a similar way to ethambutol. There is no advantage to using thioacetazone if the regimen used already contains ethambutol, but many countries in sub-Saharan Africa still use thioacetazone because it is extremely cheap. Use of thioacetazone is declining because it can cause severe (sometimes fatal) skin reactions in HIV positive patients. The biological target of thioacetazone has proven elusive and its mechanism of action remains unknown, although it is thought to interfere with mycolic acid synthesis. Adverse effects One of the documented adverse effects of thioacetazone is the excessive accumulation of serum (or blood plasma) in the brain. Another is weakening of the thyroid glands.

The film generated considerable hype prior to its release but was a commercial failure. Plot The plot, though interesting and certainly a change from the normal which tends to be either slapdash comedy or highly predictable stuff, is perhaps too radical for the digestion of the still largely conservative public. Unknown faces, a couple of which often wear deadpan expressions, expounded the problem. The opening scene is impressive enough with a well-executed dance-tableau performance of The story of life by students of an art academy.

Ashal has dreams of striking it rich before settling down to marital bliss and fate brings him face-to-face with the one person that is determined to make his dreams become a reality - Nisha (Nisha). Nisha, enamoured by Ashal, sweeps him off to Dubai to establish a branch of the academy there. Ashal gets involved with her, although he still loves Sara, and Nisha manages to create enough hurdles between them to make Sara marry a loving business tycoon, Akhter. Meera makes a guest appearance as a dancer. Ashal spots her dancing at a nightclub and begins to pursue her. And all this before the interval! After a couple of dance sequences, Ashal discovers that the woman he has been pursuing is not Sara, but her twin sister Anchal. Before he can think of starting with her where he had left off with Sara, he discovers she has a fiance, Sameer. He brings her to Pakistan, fiance in tow, to reunite with her mother and sister and discovers that Sara has become a widow. She gives birth to a son and her step mother-in-law gets her kidnapped to coerce her to marry her younger son, so as to keep the wealth in the family. Some of the developments that take place are totally unnecessary and one is left wondering why they were incorporated to begin with, except perhaps to give the required footage to the film. For instance, the sole reason for Anchal's presence seems to be an excuse to choreograph two glamorous songs on the twin sister, since they couldn't possibly be depicted on her as a widow. The presence of a villain, Grenwich, also appears to be superfluous, for he arrives and disappears without making any difference to the plot. Other than the fact that there is simply too much happening, the one aspect that detracts from the film is that some of the concepts introduced are largely unacceptable. Nisha could well have played the role of 'the other woman' without having to resort to drinking, smoking and sleeping with the hero, or for that matter, kidnapping him, brief as it may have lasted. And similarly, there were no justifiable reasons for Ashal to be drinking and sleeping around - other than the fact that he didn't have to strive hard for either. While it is heartening to see new and attractive faces finally gracing the silver screen, and Nisha and Sameer definitely have talent, both Ashal and Anchal need to be groomed further. Anchal has a tendency to speak with her eyes shut and both of them have frequently delivered their lines sans expression. Anchal's make-up, especially as Sara, is horrendous, while she looks considerably better in her role as the twin sister. The costumes are pleasing to the eye and the only grouse one has is Anchal's insistence on wearing heavy walking shoes under most of her slinky, sexy outfits. The songs are well choreographed and have catchy lyrics, especially Dharak dharak keh kehta hai dil and the cinematography is slick. One does wonder why there was such hype about leading film stars for a guest role, as Fahim Burney stated. A dance sequence in the film that eventually went to Meera, though it was an enjoyable number, didn't strike one as anything particularly spectacular. On the whole, one feels that the basic fault with Fahim Burney's direction lies in his treatment of the film as a bold television play. Otherwise, the film is packaged well and other than the one time when Ashal and Nisha are shown as speaking on stage without mikes, he has been quite meticulous about details and logical sequencing of events. Maybe he'll be wiser the next time round.

The Catholic population for which it catered was largely German in ethnic origin, although there were also significant Polish and Armenian Catholic communities. The see city of the diocese was Saratov rather than Tiraspol; the choice of Tiraspol for the name of the diocese may have been because the city had been the cathedral city of the fourteenth century diocese of Kherson. The first Roman Catholic bishop of Tiraspol, appointed in 1850, was Ferdinand Helanus Kahn, OP, a German Dominican. Wincenty Lipski, a Pole, was appointed auxiliary bishop in 1856. After Bishop Kahn's death in 1864, successive bishops were Franz Xaver Zottmann, 1872‚Äì1888; Anton Zerr, 1889‚Äì1902; Eduard von der Ropp, 1902‚Äì1903; Joseph Kessler, from 1904. Under Soviet rule, the diocese, as with the structures of many other churches and religious communities, was the subject of repression. Bishop Kessler went into exile in 1918,Joseph Aloysius Kessler in the Center for Volga German studies at the Concordia University, Portland. and the see of Tiraspol became formally vacant on his death in 1933. Meanwhile, there were attempts to organise the diocese under a series of apostolic administrators, viz.: Johannes Roth, Alexander Frison, and Augustin Baumtrog, but these attempts ended in increased repression, and in two cases, their execution (Frison in 1937, Roth in 1938).Catholic Russia The diocese remained inactive, but formally in existence, until its formal suppression in 2002, when the new diocese of St Clement in Saratov was erected, incorporating territory within Russia belonging to the former diocese of Tiraspol. Territory of the former diocese now situated in Moldova and Transnistria was assigned to the Apostolic Administration of Moldova, erected in 1993. Territory of the former diocese in southern Ukraine is now part of the Diocese of Odessa- Simferopol.

He served as a coach for four Major League Baseball teams over the course of 15 seasons (1989‚Äì2000; 2002‚Äì04). A former infielder in the minor leagues, he stood tall, weighed , and threw and batted right-handed. He was of Korean and Hawaiian descent. Early life Kim was born in Honolulu, one of three children of welterweight boxer Phil \\"Wildcat\\" Kim, who compiled a 43-15-3 record as a professional fighter, and his wife Doris Caserman. According to Wendell, his father abused both Doris and their children. Phil Kim retired from boxing in 1956, and was shot to death two years later, when Wendell was eight. The crime remains unsolved.Rains, Sally Tippett. \\"Whatever happened to Wendell Kim? The sad story\\", STL Sports Page (RobRains.com), 8/24/14. Playing career Kim played three years of varsity college baseball at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, where he was selected twice for the All-California Collegiate Athletic Association team. In 1973, he attended an open tryout camp held by the San Francisco Giants, and he impressed the team enough that they signed him as a free agent. He reached the Triple-A level in 1978, and had a .303 batting average in the Pacific Coast League. He never reached the major leagues, however, and he was released by the following spring. He played a brief stint in the Miami Amigos of the Inter-American League in 1979, but was out of baseball by the end of the season. As coach and manager In 1980 he began his post-playing career, starting out as a coach for the Double-A Shreveport Captains. Throughout the eighties he coached and managed several teams in the Giants' organization, including the Captains, Clinton Giants, Fresno Giants and Phoenix Firebirds. It wasn't until 1989 that he got his first taste of big league baseball, when he became the first base coach for the Giants under Roger Craig. The Giants won the National League pennant in Kim's first season, but fell in the 1989 World Series to the cross-bay Oakland Athletics. Kim coached for the Giants under Craig and Dusty Baker for eight years (1989‚Äì96), switching to the third-base coach's box in 1992. He then left to coach third base for the Boston Red Sox under Jimy Williams. He held that job in Boston for four years, manning the position from 1997 to 2000. After his replacement by Gene Lamont as Boston's third base coach in October 2000, Kim became manager of the 2001 Indianapolis Indians, the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. That job was short-lived, however, as he left after one season to become Frank Robinson's bench coach for the 2002 Montreal Expos. Kim returned to coaching third base, taking that position with the Chicago Cubs in 2003‚Äì04, reuniting him with Baker. Kim's controversial and aggressive style of sending runners home often resulted in outs and garnered him the nicknames \\"Wavin' Wendell,\\" \\"Windmill Wendell,\\" and \\"Wave 'em in Wendell.\\" After one year managing in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in the Washington Nationals organization, Kim retired from baseball in 2006 and moved to Arizona. In ten seasons as a minor-league manager, he compiled a win-loss record of 669‚Äì645 (.509). In retirement, Kim suffered from short-term memory loss, and was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. He died on February 15, 2015, in Phoenix at 64.

Plot Zimmy (Ali Tabish) and Tina (Resham) belong to middle-class families; live and study in Dubai, and fall in love after initial indecisiveness. Zimmy becomes a famous singer thanks to Tina who appears in his first music video as a friendly-cum-romantic gesture. Seth Tahir Dawood (Nadeem) in Bangkok catches a glimpse of Tina on TV and asks his personal secretary, played by Kanwal, to arrange his meeting with her. The secretary is helped by Sweetie (Sajid Hasan), Tina's brother - a drunkard and a gambler - who manages to convince her mother that the 40-something Seth is the perfect match for Tina. Zimmy returns from an outdoor shoot to learn of the marriage and heartbroken, vows never to get married. But unknown to him, he is admired by Haya (Zara Sheikh), the daughter of Seth Dawood and Tina's step daughter. The film moves at an amazingly rapid pace in the latter half, but sadly in no particular direction. People die as if there is they have some kind of death wish, and the abrupt conclusion confirms that the director, for reasons better known to him, was in a rush to wrap things up.

It rose to become an economic powerhouse, a commercial center whose merchants dominated Mediterranean and Italian trade for a century. before being surpassed and superseded by the Republic of Genoa. The republic‚Äôs participation in the Crusades secured valuable commercial positions for Pisan traders, thereafter the city grew in wealth and power. Pisa was a historical rival to Genoa at sea and to Florence and Lucca on land. The power of Pisa as a mighty maritime nation began to grow and reached its apex in the 11th century when it acquired traditional fame as one of the main historical Maritime Republics of Italy.  Rise to power  During the High Middle Ages the city grew into a very important commercial and naval center and controlled a significant Mediterranean merchant fleet and navy. It expanded its influence through the sack of Reggio di Calabria in the south of Italy in 1005. Pisa was in continuous conflict with the Saracens for control of the Mediterranean. In alliance with Genoa, Sardinia was captured in 1016 with the defeat of the Saracen leader MujƒÅhid al-‚ÄòƒÄmirƒ´ (). This victory gave Pisa supremacy in the Tyrrhenian Sea. When the Pisans subsequently ousted the Genoese from Sardinia, a new conflict and rivalry was born between the two maritime republics. Between 1030 and 1035 Pisa went on to successfully defeat several rival towns in the Emirate of Sicily and conquer Carthage in North Africa. In 1051‚Äì1052 Admiral Jacopo Ciurini conquered Corsica, provoking more resentment from the Genoese. In 1063, the Pisans approached the Norman Roger I of Sicily, who was conducting a campaign to conquer Sicily that would last over three decades, with the prospect of a joint attack against Palermo. Roger declined due to other commitments. With no land support, the Pisan attack against Palermo failed. In 1060 Pisa engaged in its first battle against Genoa and the Pisan victory helped to consolidate its position in the Mediterranean. Pope Gregory VII recognized in 1077 the new \\"laws and customs of the sea\\" instituted by the Pisans, and Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV granted them the right to name their own consuls, advised by a Council of Elders. This was simply a confirmation of the present situation, because at the time the marquis of Tuscany (the nominal feudal sovereign of Pisa) had already been excluded from power. Pisa sacked the Zirid city of Mahdia in 1088. Four years later, Pisan and Genoese ships helped Alfonso VI of Castile force El Cid out of Valencia. In 1092 Pope Urban II awarded Pisa supremacy over Corsica and Sardinia and at the same time elevated the Diocese of Pisa to the rank of metropolitan archdiocese.  Territories and administration  Dagobert sailing in a ship flying the cross of St George The territory subjected to the Republic of Pisa has had important variations over the centuries. During the period of great political and economic expansion, the republic had its own consoles with commercial farms and warehouses in many seaside cities: Gaeta, Naples, Salerno, Messina, Palermo, Trapani, Mazara del Vallo and in Tunis. Pisan troops were among the first to conquer Jerusalem in 1099, and were led by their archbishop, Dagobert, the future Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. With significant presences in the Levant, in the Byzantine Empire and in the Crusader states of Palestine, particularly in Constantinople (where the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus granted them special mooring and trading rights), Antioch, Latakia, Tyre, Acre, Jaffa, Tripoli, Alexandria and Cairo. In all these cities the Pisans were granted privileges and immunity from taxation, but had to contribute to their defence in case of attack. In the 12th century the Pisan quarter in the eastern part of Constantinople had grown to 1,000 people. The well-known \\"Societ√† dei Vermigli\\" was established in Tyre and was reported in the defense of the city against the attack by Saladin in 1187. For some years of that century Pisa was the most prominent merchant and military ally of the Byzantine Empire, surpassing the Republic of Venice itself. Its influence also extended to the major islands of the Tyrrhenian Sea: * Sardinia from 1207 to 1324. * Corsica from 1050 to 1295. * Balearic Islands from 1115 to 1184. Pisan merchants were among the initiators of the 1113‚Äì1115 Balearic Islands expedition.Charles Julian Bishko (1975), \\"The Spanish and Portuguese Reconquest, 1095-1492\\", A History of the Crusades, Vol. 3: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, ed. Harry W. Hazard (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), 405. After the defeat of Meloria in 1284, the territory of the Republic gradually became more continental, limiting itself to the coast and to the immediate hinterland that from Migliarino to Piombino, with the islands of Elba, Gorgona, Pianosa, Giglio and Giannutri and the exclaves of Castiglione della Pescaia and Porto Ercole. The important Pisan port, key to the entire state economy, was defended by some towers on the sea and on the land side by a fortified system of fortresses on the hills behind, havingLari as the seat of the captaincy of the upper hills, Crespina, Fauglia, Castellina, Rosignano and finally Livorno with the plan of Porto Pisano, essential outlet to dominate the western Mediterranean, while the area that intersected the Arno with the Valdera was defended by the castles of Appiano, Petriolo, Montecuccoli and finally, by order of foundation, that of Ponte di Sacco (1392).

The main strongholds were the Verruca fortress, near Calci, which served as the cornerstone of the mountain defensive system on the Lucca border that ran from the ancient lago di Bientina to the Serchio with the castles of Caprona, Vicopisano, Asciano and Agnano. On the Florentine road to block the access to Pisa there was the castle of Cascina, the scene of important Battle of Cascina. Castelnuovo di Val di Cecina was long disputed by Volterra. The Maremma territory south of the port of Vada was administered in the name of the republic by the Pisan counts of Della Gherardesca family with the castles located in numerous cities such as of Guardistallo, Bibbona, Riparbella and Suvereto.  Decline The rivalry between Pisa and Republic of Genoa intensified in the 13th century and resulted in the naval Battle of Meloria (1284), fought right in front of the Pisan port, which marked the beginning of the decline of the power of the city, with the renunciation of any claim on Corsica and with the sale of part of Sardinia to Genoa in 1299. Furthermore, from 1323, the Aragonese conquest of Sardinia began, which deprived the city of the dominion over the giudicati of Cagliari and Gallura. Given the difficult economic and political situation of the now decadent Republic, on February 13, 1399, the lord of Pisa Gherardo Appiani sold the city and the countryside for the sum of 200,000 gold florins to Gian Galeazzo Visconti of the Pisan branch of the Visconti family to become lord of Piombino and obtain the appointment as Lord of Pisa. However, the control of the Republic by the Visconti did not last long, in fact Pisa maintained its independence and dominion over that part of the Tuscan coast and beyond until 1406, when it was occupied by the mercenaries Angelo Tartaglia and Muzio Attendolo Sforza who ordered the annexation to the Republic of Florence. With the Florence's domination began an unstoppable decline of the city which, in the past centuries had spread its Romanesque architectural style, even in Sardinian churches. Suffocated the commercial and merchant traffic, which had characterized its efficiency for centuries, some of the most important Pisan families such as the Alliata, the Della Gherardesca, the Caetani and the Upezzinghi, to escape the Florentine domination, emigrated to other Italian city-states, in particular to the Kingdom of Sicily.
