It has a mixed intake of both boys and girls ages 11‚Äì18, and has over 2,100 pupils on roll with a comprehensive admissions policy. The school is operated by Outwood Grange Academies Trust, and the current principal is Brian Kelly. It publishes a newsletter, Outlook Magazine, on a termly basis. History Outwood Grange School was established in 1972 through the merger of Outwood and Stanley secondary schools, with John L Snowdon as its first headteacher. The Department for Education stated that when Michael Wilkins became headteacher of the school in 2001 it was performing in the bottom 10% of schools. In 2001 BBC secondary school league tables placed Outwood Grange School at 1581st of 3571 secondary schools in England for GCSE results, achieving a 54% pass rate compared to a 50% national average. In 2002 it became Outwood Grange College after achieving specialist technology college status. The school subsequently undertook major redevelopment work to improve its grounds, buildings and facilities in general. This included major renovation works to the majority of the Upper College Block, where new ICT suites, a recording studio and improved reception facilities were created. The Lower College Hall also received attention and was equipped with retractable seating and conferencing equipment. In 2005 a gravel playing field, commonly known as \\"redgra\\" after its composition of red gravel, was replaced with an astroturf sports field after many years of fundraising. In the same year a new Business and Training Centre was opened, housing both the Business Department and additional training facilities for rental purposes. The college has used these advanced facilities to aid other schools in the region, and to participate in the launch of national initiatives such as \\"Make Your Mark Start Talking Ideas\\", which encourages children and young people to engage themselves with businesses. In 2008 Outwood Grange College, Horbury School, and Wakefield City High School together formed Aspire Trust, and became trust schools. In spring 2009 the school was praised in a speech made by Prime Minister Gordon Brown after securing government approval to become England's first \\"Academy of Excellence\\". During the transition to academy status the school left Aspire Trust. =Outwood Grange Academy= In September 2009, Outwood Grange College re-opened as Outwood Grange Academy, operated by the newly formed Outwood Grange Academies Trust. The school's headteacher, Michael Wilkins, became Chief Executive of the trust, which has since gone on to operate other schools across Northern England using Outwood Grange as a model. Mr Wilkins received criticism for spending public funds excessively and for overseeing a dramatic increase in pupil exclusions and expulsions. In 2014 Michael Wilkins received a knighthood for services to Education. The Sir Michael Wilkins Arts Centre opened to pupils in January 2016, after suffering from delays due to the original construction company entering into bankruptcy. The purpose built ¬£6.5 million facility includes art studios, performance spaces, and recording studios. Tracking pupil progress The college uses a series of effort grades known as \\"Praising Stars.\\" The system uses grades prefixed with the letter \\"E\\", standing for \\"Effort\\", which range from E1 (Brilliant) to E3 (Reasonable) to E6 (Exclusion). Praising Stars, or 'E Grades' as they are commonly called, are given to pupils six times a year as a form of report to parents. It is commonplace for individual year groups to have assemblies which recognise and commend pupils who have performed well throughout the term achieving E1s, E2s and E3s. In many cases individual teachers also use Praising Stars as a way of marking pieces of classwork. Pastoral care In early 2007, the college revealed plans to restructure how tutor groups, the main provision of pastoral care within the college, are organised, moving from the traditional horizontal structure to a vertical one. Although controversial, the plan progressed through consultation and has been put into place from September 2008.Outwood Grange College news The former structure saw each pupil belonging to a form group of around 30 pupils from their own year- group, which they remain in, together with a teacher acting as a tutor, for their entire school career. The new structure keeps a consistent teacher acting as a tutor to the group, but is mixed-age with pupils from all year groups being included in each mentoring group. This means that each group evolves every year, as older pupils leave and are replaced by younger pupils entering the school. Pupils entering the school are guaranteed, as in the past, to have at least one friend in their mentoring group. Vertical structuring has been implemented in other secondary schools, the main advantages being seen as the mixing of ages leading to an increased sense of community, allowing for pupils to share experiences, foster understanding and reduce bullying. Initially this program included members of the 6th form of the academy as part of these vertical mentor groups, or VMGs. However as of 2015 these groups were rearranged. Members of the 6th Form were taken out of the vertical mentor groups and instead placed within mixed guidance groups of year 12s and 13s. This meant the vertical structure was still maintained however it was on a smaller scale of both sides of the academy. As well as separating the secondary school students and 6th form students they also changed the rooms of these groups. This was so that the vertical mentor groups of the same continents were able to be in the same buildings in order to increase coherency within the academy.

By 2005 that result had risen to 83%, an increase underpinned by the quality of an updated curriculum and new intervention schemes used to aid underperforming pupils. Additionally, it has been said that much of the increase in 'success' was brought about by using 'GCSE equivalent' qualifications such as GNVQs, which have been criticised as resulting in illusory increases in statistical performance rather than genuine academic improvement.

It was founded in 1972 by Eileen Lodge, a British nurse, who had emigrated to Nepal in the 1950s to work with the International Nepal Fellowship (INF). The Nepal office headquarters is in Tutepani, Lalitpur-14. In 1996 it established Lalgadh Leprosy Services Centre, a hospital in Lalgadh, Dhanusa district in the southeast part of the country. The Self Care Training Centre run from the hospital is still a key service for patients who have been damaged by leprosy, as they learn how to live with anaesthetic hands or feet or other problems, without making matters worse. There are many skills that they need to learn, which help prevent further ulcers and damage. Two weeks in the SCTC teaches them the main skills, and also links them with a self-help group local to their home. The community development work at Lalgadh has been a major part of their work since 2000, ever since it was recognised that the key to beating leprosy lies in changing the attitudes of ordinary people living in the community. This work has already improved the lives of many destitute people affected by leprosy, but has also transformed whole communities. The key has been to empower people affected by leprosy to help their communities actively in practical ways. Many of them were marginalised and treated as human debris, not to be included in village life and certainly not useful. The major community development programmes ‚Äì STEP and RECLAIM ‚Äì enable them to work together and initiate projects in their own villages for water, sanitation etc. The hospital also has the Village Alive Programme which is working with 6 extremely poor villages in their work area. They are in bad shape, but each has a nucleus of trust in one of their existing self-help groups connected to the village. Their Field Staff work with them to identify problem areas and help them find ways of solving them. These tend to focus on issues such as health, education, sanitation etc. Farmers' groups, women's groups have also been started; the different groups run saving schemes which have enabled group members to start businesses and carry out village projects such as the building of proper toilets. Every year in November the hospital runs a hand surgery camp. A team of doctors from the UK stay for a fortnight and operate all day and every day on needy patients. The NLT Kathmandu office shelters leprosy-affected people (and other differently-able, poor and marginalized), provides them skill-based/capacity-building training, and employs them in its handicraft production project, which produces high-quality handicrafts, especially for the export market. NLT is also a member of World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), WFTO-Asia, and Fair Trade Group (FTG) Nepal. The Headquarters staff are led by Mr. Kamal Shrestha, the CEO of NLT, also provide a range of support services for the various projects of NLT, especially for the hospital in Lalgadh out of which many projects are run. This involves sourcing equipment and supplies in Kathmandu, liaising with the various government departments involved, organising and hosting NLT Executive Board meetings that have to take place periodically, and overseeing funds coming from abroad, ensuring their safe distribution to the various projects. The Lydia Children's Fund is also run from the Kathmandu office. It supports around 90 young people aged from 5 to 18 years old in school. For these children, some of whom have no living parents, the Fund enables them to receive an education which they could not otherwise access. This Head Office also runs a Social Support programmes providing help to about 50 people who are vulnerable due to poverty, age, sickness or disability and who lack any support network. 2015 saw staff from the hospital going into the mountains with supplies to help those that had been made homeless by the earthquake. This work has continued into 2016. It has been realised by the hospital staff that this will be an ongoing business as the mountain areas are hard to access and are many miles away from the capital, Kathmandu. The headquarters in Lalitpur underwent a facelift in 2016 to make room for a local road widening scheme. The building lost several feet from its front.

The remains were discovered in late 1979 on a battlefield of the Vicksburg Campaign. Artifacts accompanying the remains showed that the person had been a Confederate soldier but did not show the person's identity, unit, or place of origin. The discovery led to the establishment of the Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier in the Confederate Veterans Cemetery at Beauvoir. The soldier's remains were buried there in a cypress casket in 1980. The tomb, inscribed \\"Known but to God\\", was dedicated on June 6, 1981. Approval of the plan and official designation was sought and received from all recognized Confederate organizations, including the Sons of Confederate Veterans, United Daughters of the Confederacy, Military Order of the Stars and Bars, and Children of the Confederacy. The tomb's two sides are inscribed: \\"The Unknown Soldier of the Confederate States of America.\\" The head of the tomb bears the inscription: Known but to God.

Its main object was to promote closer relations between the European and Atlantic countries by providing a regular forum in Britain for informed discussion of their problems and possibilities for better economic and political co- operation. The Founders stated that their purpose was to disseminate authoritative information concerning the work of International Organizations such as the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Western European Union, the European Coal and Steel Community, Euratom, the European Economic Community, as well as the European Free Trade Association, the Association for General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, and the Economic Commission for Europe. In addition to holding monthly dinners and meetings in London, the group sent many delegations abroad to study at first hand the European and NATO institutions in Brussels, Paris, and Luxembourg, as well as visiting Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Greece, as the guests of governments and International Organizations. Group representatives have also visited the United States, the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc with the object of improving relations between West and East. The Group has also held Discussions on European-Atlantic relations with the rest of the world, including the Middle East, Far East, Africa, Afghanistan, and Latin American countries. The Group's London office was originally at 6 Gertrude Street, Chelsea. The President was the Earl of Bessborough, D.L. (a founder), and there was an impressive list of Vice-Presidents, including the Marquess of Lansdowne, the Earl of Limerick, the Earl Jellicoe, The Lord Carrington, The Lord Chalfont, The Lord Shawcross, The Lord Granchester. Sir Nicholas Henderson, Sir Frederic Bennett, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, Bt., General Sir Harry Tuzo, and Douglas Fairbanks junior. The Chairman was Geoffrey Rippon, Lord Rippon of Hexham, Q.C., Vice-Chairmen were Sir Antony Buck, Q.C., M.P., and Sir W. Hugh-Jones. Director was Elma Dangerfield, O.B.E.who co-founded the Group in 1954 and remained active in it in her nineties. Until her decease in January 2006 her co-Director was Justin Glass, who became Finance Director in 1987 and Director in 1992, retiring from the Group in 2012. He was succeeded as Director by Anthony Westnedge, OBE. Other E-AG Presidents have included The Lord Layton CH CBE, the Earl of Listowel, Sir Geoffrey de Freitas KCMG MP and, since the 1990s, The Earl of Bessborough DL, Sir Frank Roberts GCMG GCVO, Lord Rippon of Hexham QC, The Lord Dahrendorf, Lord Judd, The Earl of Limerick KBE, The Viscount Montgomery of Alamein CMG CBE, Sir Michael Burton KCVO CMG, The Baroness Hooper CMG, Lord Dykes and Baroness Symons of Vernam Dean. The E-AG hosted Anniversary celebration banquets for the founding of NATO every decade. In 1989, the 40th Anniversary, the Duke of Edinburgh was the main Speaker at Guildhall and General John Galvin, US Army, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe also spoke. In 1999 the 50th Anniversary celebration was at Guildhall with the Duke of York, the Secretary-General of NATO Herr Manfred Worner, the Foreign Minister of Poland and 525 influential delegates. In 2009 the 60th Anniversary was held at St James's Palace with 27 Ambassadors among the delegates and the main speaker again was the Duke of York. The monthly events of the E-AG were addressed by figures as diverse as President Nyerere of Tanzania, King Hussain of Jordan and his brother Prince Hassan, Ian Duncan-Smith, Michael Howard, David Blunkett, and more recently by Former Presidents - Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Tan Mahathir of Malaysia and Vytautis Landsbergis of Lithuania. Elma Dangerfield was appointed CBE for her work with the Group. What is now considered an annual event is when two ex-Congressmen representing the Democrat and Republican parties are guests at a Meeting, usually held in November, that concentrates on American Politics both Home and Abroad. The European-Atlantic Group, a non-aligned, all party, registered charity, is a wide-ranging Westminster based group in the field of international relations. Most of the EAG's recent meetings [2018] have been held at Westminster in House of Commons Committee Rooms, but when Parliament is not sitting meetings may be held in the City or elsewhere in London. Few matters of importance in Europe or America can remain untouched by wider world affairs, so countries such as Afghanistan and South Sudan as well as Lithuania and Ukraine, and many others around the world, have been the subjects of expert discussion and analysis. EAG speakers have included royalty and presidents, the ambassadors of America, China and Russia, ministers, shadow ministers, the head of MI5, and the chiefs of the British armed forces. The Trustees of the EAG were Lord Hamilton of Epsom and Mr Christopher Arkell until July 2018, when new Trustees were appointed. The EAG aims to strengthen trans-Atlantic links. The future of the EAG depends on the support of those who care about issues such as defence and security, the UK relationship with America, NATO, and other important international challenges. The EAG is a non-party organisation and is classified as educational by the Charity Commission. The Director between 2014 and July 2018 was Charles Bennett.

The district is centred on the A61 Leeds Road south of Lofthouse. It grew up as a pit village and was only a small settlement until the 1970s, when construction of new houses caused it to grow and merge with neighbouring settlements such as Wrenthorpe and Stanley. In 2001, it had a population of 7,623. History Not quite recorded in the Doomsday book, it is possible the settlement of Outwood gets its earliest literary mention in around 1400 in \\"The Lyttle Gest of Robyn Hode\\". Transcribed from at least a century of oral renditions telling the stories of Robin Hood and published in print form a century later in 1500, the prominent work features a mention of the name or phrase 'Outwoods'. This is quite possibly the earliest mention in any work of literature of one of England's greatest national myths alongside King Arthur and Joseph of Arimathea. Outwood was the site of a pit disaster on 4 March 1879, when 21 people were killed in an explosion at Deep Drop Colliery.Stanley History Online - Deep Drop Colliery explosion In 1905, the miners left homeless by the Kinsley evictions camped at Outwood Hall Farm, off Victoria Street, until they were able to return to their homes in Kinsley.\\"Outwood Hall Farm and evicted miners\\", Wakefield Express, page 30, 12 December 2014 The area near the railway station was once the site of Lofthouse pit, that is known for the disaster in March 1973 that claimed the lives of several miners.http://www.stanleyhistoryonline.com/Lofthouse-Colliery-Disaster.html The coal mine closed in 1981, and many of the coal miners subsequently took transfers to the new Selby Coalfield and left the village.BBC Bradford & West Yorkshire - 'It was never the same again!' The site of the mine is now a golf course and housing estate. The Wakefield 41 Industrial Estate is also situated near to Outwood. The parish church St Mary Magdalene was dedicated in 1858.  Transport  Outwood railway station is an unmanned station, served by Northern, offering rail services towards Leeds, Wakefield, Doncaster and Sheffield. The A61 (Leeds Road) runs through the middle of Outwood, connecting towards Leeds to the north and Wakefield to the south. Junction 41 of the M1 is also close-by.  Education  Outwood is home to Outwood Grange Academy, one of the largest secondary schools in the UK with over 2,100 students. The local primary schools are Outwood Primary Academy Ledger Lane (headteacher Rachael Skirrow) and Rooks Nest Academy (headteacher Kimberley Dawson).  Sport and recreation  Outwood is home to one park. Outwood Park has facilities for football, 5 a side, crown green bowling and a children's play area. Outwood is also home to two other playing fields and another play area. Local teams include Nightingale Football Club and Outwood Rangers Junior Football Club.  Local agriculture  Outwood is located within the Rhubarb Triangle. Because of its mining history Outwood has good supplies of soot and ash to condition its soil, which provide good conditions for the plant to grow.

In 1944, as it was becoming clear that hostilities in Europe (the Second World War) would soon be at an end, SAAB realised that the company had to diversify from purely military endeavours if it were to survive. The board therefore decided to put into action a plan to manufacture a twin-engined, short- to medium-haul passenger aircraft, as a successor for the Douglas DC-3. (This was the same commercially driven stimulus that led to automobile production, with the Ursaab and subsequent Saab 92 passenger vehicles.) The design of the 90 Scandia was quite similar to the DC-3. The most distinct visible difference was that the 90 had tricycle landing gear while the DC-3 had a tailwheel. The Scandia also had a quite different vertical stabilizer shape, and numerous more subtle differences. The 90 had to compete with the many surplus DC-3s available on the market at the same time, making sales difficult. Design and development Model of Saab Scandia at Link√∂ping Development started in February 1944. Takeoff weight was specified at about 11,600 kg, with a range of about 1,000 km. The prototype Saab 90 (Scandia) first flew in November 1946. It was capable of seating 24‚Äì32 passengers, with low-speed capability. It was to be fitted with Pratt & Whitney R-2000 engines. It had a single nosewheel and fully retractable landing gear. ABA Swedish Airlines, a predecessor of SAS, ordered 11 examples. The Type certificate was issued in June 1950. Delivery started in October 1950 but, after testing, specification had changed to the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E. Two Brazilian airlines (VASP and Aerovias do Brasil) also ordered a total of six aircraft. The prototype was subsequently converted to a luxury private executive aircraft for the Brazilian industrialist Olavo Fontoura. =Design= The Scandia project was initiated in 1944 by a supposed need (after World War II) for an aircraft carrying 25‚Äì30 passengers for a distance of up to 1000 km. Main design objectives were: safety; two engines; long life; economic operation. The wing was shaped, using NACA profiles, to provide good stalling characteristics. Low wing design was chosen since it provided: * Less structural weight * Better safety in an emergency landing * Possibility for one continuous flap The wing was built in three pieces. The centre section with engine mounts, and left and right sections which were bolted to the centre section, immediately outboard of the engine nacelles. The fuselage diameter was chosen to allow for four seats per row. This configuration gave a capacity of 32 passengers. A configuration with wider and more comfortable seats, three seats per row, carrying a total of 24 passengers was also offered. The prototype (90.001) was equipped with Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp R2000 engines (changed to P&W; Twin Wasp R2180 on the production version). The entire aircraft was built of metal except for the rudders which were fabric- covered metal frames. =Test flights= The prototype (SE-BCA) made its first flight on November 16, 1946. Claes Smith was the pilot. The first flight lasted for 20 minutes. The plane had exceptionally good slow-flying characteristics, with full control down to 110‚Äì115 km/h. The stall was slow and preceded by vibrations. The plane also turned out to be easily maneuvered with one engine shut down, which at the time was typically not the case with twin-engined aircraft. Unfortunately the rudder harmony was not satisfactory, with high control forces in some situations. The engine installation also needed redesign. The prototype flew a total of 154 hours before the winter of 1947/48 when it was parked in the hangar for modifications. The engines were elevated for increased clearance between propeller blades and ground. The cabin, which previously contained only test equipment, was furnished. On February the 7th 1948 the prototype took off again and began the second testing phase. The second phase consisted of mainly performance tests. After 700 hours of test flying it was decided to introduce the following changes to the production planes: *More powerful engines *Four-blade Hamilton-Standard propellers *Spring tabs on rudder and elevators for reduced control forces =Promotional flying= In 1947 the prototype had quickly visited Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland. In May 1948 it made a one-day trip from Link√∂ping to Newcastle via Oslo. During these flights the prototype had only test equipment on board. No real demonstration flights with potential customers took place. For this reason it was decided to make a real demonstration tour through Europe now that the cabin was properly outfitted. The prototype departed on August 9, 1948. After visits to 11 European countries, SE-BCA returned to Link√∂ping on November 11, 1948. The first stop was in Stockholm. Then in the following order it visited Norway (Oslo), Ireland (Dublin), Great Britain (Prestwick, Gatwick, Jersey), Denmark (Copenhagen), Belgium (Brussels), the Netherlands (Amsterdam), Switzerland (Geneva, Z√ºrich), Portugal (Lisbon, Oporto), Spain (Madrid), France (Paris) and finally Finland. Total flying time was 113 hours with 123 takeoffs and a total distance of 37,200 km. 1,200 passengers were transported. In the Netherlands, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands flew the plane. In every town the Scandia was welcomed by the respective airline and local press, but it did not result in any orders. Many airlines also visited Link√∂ping for a closer look and demonstration during the years 1948‚Äì49. Some of these were DNL, Fred Olsen, DDL, Aero Oy, Swissair, FAMA, Aerol, Argentinas, KLM, Air Service, Sabena and Garuda. A second promotional tour was started on August 16, 1949. With six extra fuel tanks, each carrying 400 litres, SE-BCA started a tour that would take it to three continents. This was also the last time it was seen in Sweden. The first trip went to Paris, where the extra fuel tanks were removed. On August 23, SE-BCA arrived to Addis Abeba (Ethiopia). The following day, emperor Haile Selassie went on a demonstration tour. Present on this tour was also Carl Gustaf von Rosen, who at the time was counsellor to the Ethiopian Air Force. Athens, Cairo, Asmara, Port Sudan and Luxor were also visited on this tour. On this tour the plane was subjected to temperatures of 50 ¬∞C, with no problems. When the plane returned to Paris the extra fuel tanks were reinstalled. On September 4, SE-BCA left Paris with destination Pratt & Whitney's home base in Hartford, Connecticut. With stop-overs in Prestwick, Iceland and Greenland, the trip took three days. In Hartford the extra fuel tanks were removed and the interior was refitted. An extensive demonstration program all over the USA followed. Some of the cities visited were New York, Washington, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles and Houston. In Los Angeles Howard Hughes flew the Scandia, and he praised the design. On October 14 the Scandia returned to Hartford. Operational history VASP Scandia PP-SQN (nearest) at S√£o Paulo Congonhas airport in 1965 The first production Scandias were delivered in 1950. SAS received its eight aircraft between October 1950 and October 1954. SAS initially operated its Scandias on intra-Scandinavian flights. Scheduled services by Scandias were operated also to European cities including Amsterdam, Brussels and London Airport (Heathrow) between 1951 and 1955. VASP operated its fleet of new and ex-SAS Scandias on intra-Brazilian scheduled flights between October 1950 and late 1966. The Swedish Air Force put heavy and insistent demands upon the SAAB factory, for the Saab 29 fighter aircraft, which spelled the end of the Scandia project in Sweden, with residual production being undertaken by Fokker, in the Netherlands. Altogether, only 18 examples were manufactured. The entire SAS fleet was eventually purchased by VASP, in 1957. A larger version with pressurised cabin called 90B was planned, but never made. The last flight with a 90 Scandia was on July 22, 1969. The sole surviving Scandia is the 16th built, ex VASP PP- SQR, which is preserved in deteriorating condition by a museum at Bebedouro in the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil.

Early life He was the eldest son of the minister John Roberts, born on 6 March 1800 at the chapel-house, Llanbrynmair, Montgomeryshire. He was taught until he was ten by his father, and subsequently at a school at Shrewsbury, after which he worked on his father's farm, and acquired a knowledge of shorthand. After preaching for his father's church around 1819, Roberts went to the dissenting academy kept by George Lewis (1763‚Äì1822), first at Llanfyllin, and later at Newtown, where he remained for six years. In April 1826 he was invited to become assistant pastor to his father, and was ordained 15 August 1827. He succeeded in 1834 to the sole charge of the church, together with eight chapels of ease. He attended them all, with the assistance of his brother John Roberts (1804‚Äì1884). John Roberts (1804‚Äì1884) Roberts advocated free trade, opposing the Corn Laws. He was an early advocate of Welsh disestablishment, and in 1834‚Äì35 organised a drive by Welsh independent churches to pay their chapel debts. In 1840‚Äì41 he engaged in controversy with Lewis Edwards on presbyterianism and independency. The degree of M.A. was conferred on him by Lane Theological Seminary, Cincinnati in 1841. Reformer Roberts was a pacifist, worked for the London Peace Society, and wrote on the peace issue. His Thoughts on War, addressed to People of All Classes (1834) explained that the absolute pacifist line required by the Peace Society of London need not be followed by pacifists in local \\"auxiliary\\" societies. In 1843, Roberts founded a Welsh language journal, Y Cronicl, in which he campaigned for radical causes. In 1857, he travelled to Tennessee in the hope of setting up a Welsh colony there, with a group including his brother Richard Roberts (1810‚Äì1883). Both a pacifist and an abolitionist, Roberts was placed in a difficult position by the outbreak of the American Civil War. After ten years, he gave up the attempt and returned to Wales. He was one of the early advocates of postal reform. The Times newspaper, in an obituary for Samuel Roberts, reported that \\"he had pleaded before many associations for a low and uniform rate of postage, both inland and foreign, addressing letters on the subject to the Welsh Cymreigyddion societies in 1824 and to the authorities of the General Post Office in 1829 and again in 1836\\".Times, 30 September 1885 In 1883 he received a grant of ¬£50 from the Royal Bounty Fund, on the recommendation of the prime minister, William Gladstone, as recognition for his pioneering work in the cause of social progress and postal reform.Williams, p. 99 Last years During his later years Roberts concentrated on denominational issues, supporting the congregational principle of self-government against attempts to organise Welsh independent churches on presbyterian lines. In 1868 he started a weekly paper called Y Dydd (published at Dolgelly), which was later amalgamated with Y Tyst. In 1878 he started another paper, Y Celt. Roberts died unmarried on 24 September 1885, and was buried in Conway cemetery in the same grave as his two brothers, Richard and John, who had predeceased him. A monument provided by public subscription was placed over the grave, and a memorial tablet in Llanbrynmair chapel.

It is planned be the largest real snow indoor ski slope in the world with a 415 metre long slope, 70 metre wide run, and a 100 metre drop; accommodating 1000 skiers per hour: the overall ski area of SnOasis will be more than double that of any other indoor ski slope in the world. The project is being promoted by Onslow Suffolk Ltd with a budget of ¬£300 million and would create around 1800 new jobs in the local area once fully open, and 3500 jobs created during the construction phase. There is a separate proposal to build 537 new homes adjacent to the site. The scheme is being opposed by SnOasis Community Alliance which represents 11 town and parish councils and by SnOasis Concern. History The site was acquired in 2001 and planning permission was applied for in 2004. Local planning permission for the project was granted on 21 April 2006 and public inquiry was announced on 26 July 2006 which upheld the decision, subject to conditions. Final government approval was granted by Hazel Blears on 6 November 2008 concluding that all the conditions had been met. Construction work cannot start until Natural England, a government agency, issues a licence to move the wildlife. The majority shareholder of the scheme in 2008 was an Irish private equity group First Equity Group, which owned 70% of Onslow Suffolk with debt funding provided by Allied Irish Bank. The managing director was Godfrey Spanner. In January 2011 the promoters said that construction would start in 'late 2011'. However, the leader of Mid-Suffolk District Council has stated that the scheme is highly unlikely to go ahead.East Anglian Daily Times 31 May 2012 In February 2011, Mr Spanner was found guilty by the High Court in February 2011 of wrongful trading in a separate venture, Onslow Ditchling Ltd, of which he was a director which had been liquidated with debts of ¬£900,000. The judge, Mr Justice Norris, said Mr Spanner and the other director of Onslow Ditchling Ltd showed \\"wilfully blind optimism\\" and \\"reckless belief\\". Mr Spanner says that the verdict will have no impact on Snoasis and that he is appealing the verdict. Mr Spanner was declared bankrupt in March 2012 and no longer has any link with Onslow Suffolk. As of April 2011 a number of planning issues were still outstanding and the predicted opening date had been put back to November 2014. By February 2013, Godfrey Spanner, manager for the SnOasis project, said he was confident that once a business plan on the new railway station on the site is completed, work can start and will be finished by 2016. In November 2016, the developer stated that he hoped SnOasis would be open in 2020 and that \\"It will become a reality\\" as ¬£20m had already been spent on the project. He explained that once SnOasis is built, it would be home to 14 winter sports, the world's largest snow dome, and the UK's first speed skating circuit.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-37837797 On 16 November 2016 the Mid Suffolk Council confirmed that it had registered and was considering an application to satisfy all outstanding matters and that a final decision by its Committee was due in 2017 following a recommendation by the Council's planning manager, Steven Stroud. By 2018, the scheme remains undetermined. , Godfrey Spanner is listed as the contact on the SnOasis website.http://www.snoasis.co.uk/snoasis/contacts_location In April 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown, Mid Suffolk District Council used emergency delegated powers to approve the Snoasis development to proceed.https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/snoasis-ski-centre-given-final-green- light-after-over-a-decade-1-6615618  Features  thumb The resort will include various indoor and outdoor activities to suit a range of age groups. =Winter sports= * One of the largest indoor ski slopes in the world: 415m long with 100m vertical drop - virtually international competition standard. * Nursery slope 100m long with a 9m vertical drop * External ice rink * Full length 100m drop dry run bobsleigh track * Luge run * Cross country ski run * 400m speed skating / ice track * 16m ice climbing wall & 50m ice wall =General sports= * Multi purpose sports hall * Health and fitness centre * Outdoor sports pitches * Roller blade track * Rock climbing wall * Swimming pool * Jogging track * Skate park * Squash * Tennis * 5-a-side football * Rowing * Windsurfing * Sailing * Canoeing * Fishing =Accommodation and amenities= * 350 log cabins * 350 bed four-star hotel and conference centre * 100 apartments * 17 restaurants and bars * Food court * Shops * 20-lane bowling alley * Snooker/pool hall * Cinema * Nightclub * Health spa Transport Some 600,000 visitors are expected per year with 2000 parking spaces provided on the site itself and a new railway station at Great Blakenham on the Great Eastern Main Line with a further 500 spaces. The main access routes by car will via the A12 from the south and the A14 from the west. A12 traffic will join the A14 briefly at the Copdock roundabout which would be improved. Employment The developers estimate that the scheme will create 3,500 jobs during the construction phase and 1,800 when it is operational. That will also be offering an array of skills and training initiatives. Opposition concerns =Traffic= Concern has been expressed by some local residents over potential traffic congestion. They stated that the traffic modelling at the Copdock Roundabout was unrealistic and was based on only 737,000 visitors in first year and 825,000 in the second without sufficient sensitivity testing for higher traffic levels. They also expressed concern about the potential for traffic from the south to 'rat run' through Sproughton saying this had not been considered. The developers plan to pay for improvements to the Copdock intersection of the A12 and A14. =Biodiversity= Part of the site is in a Special Landscape Area designated a County Wildlife Site by Suffolk Wildlife Trust and protected great crested newts and badgers will have to be moved as part of the planning agreement. The Suffolk Wildlife Trust objected on the basis that there would be a \\"significant loss to biodiversity\\". Natural England objected from the start saying that insufficient measures to protect great crested newts on the site. The developers say they will be creating a ecological mitigation area. =Damage to the rural nature of the area= It was stated that the huge development would be out of character with the rural location with increased noise, air and light pollution with a negative effect on tranquillity in the area although they are adding 140,000 trees in . =Climate change= sNOasis Concern estimate that the SnOasis site and its visitors are likely to generate at least 34,000 tons of CO2 per annum exacerbating climate change and that the proposed of woodland will only cover 10% of the emissions. The developers claim that 75% of their energy will come from renewable sources include a large-scale woodchip burner and a proposed \\"energy from waste\\" incinerator on land adjacent to the site is also proposed and they also plan to plant 130,000 trees to act as a carbon sink.

The work had its genesis as a serialization. In June‚ÄìDecember 1876 it appeared as a series of sketches in Belgravia magazine. Plot introduction The novel is a satire consisting almost entirely of dialogue and mocking most of the important figures then at Oxford University, with regards to aestheticism and Hellenism. Characters The famous people Mallock depicts are as follows, together with the names of the characters that represent them. :Matthew Arnold ‚Äî Mr. Luke :Thomas Carlyle ‚Äî Donald Gordon :William Kingdon Clifford ‚Äî Mr. Saunders :Violet Fane ‚Äî Mrs. Sinclair :William Money Hardinge ‚Äî Robert Leslie :Thomas Huxley ‚Äî Mr. Storks :Benjamin Jowett ‚Äî Dr. Jenkinson :W.

As author David Daiches wrote in 1951, \\"If we can read through The New Republic without at one point or another being made to feel a little foolish, we are wise indeed.\\" Walter Pater is of particular interest because Mallock's apparent homophobia against him‚Äîexpressed first in the more extensive treatment given the Mr. Rose character in the initial serialization‚Äîhelped ruin Pater's public reputation as well as his career at Oxford. Reading Wilde, Querying Spaces: An Exhibition Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Trials of Oscar Wilde notes that, as Linda Dowling has observed, \\"Mr. Rose\\" is \\"the first in a long line of popular depictions of effeminate English aesthetes such as Gilbert's Bunthorne and Du Maurier's Postlewaite and Maudle\\".Wilde at Oxford/Oxford Gone Wilde This depiction of Pater appeared during the competition for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry and played a role in convincing Pater to remove himself from consideration.

Containing Libya Op√©ration √âpervier began on the night of February 13th and 14th 1986, under the defence agreement between France and Chad, and was prepared during a meeting in N'Djamena between the Chadian President Hiss√®ne Habr√© and the French Defence Minister Paul Quil√®s. Its goal was to contain the Libyan invasion that had resulted in the loss of all Chadian territory north of the 16th parallel and was threatening the capital; a new offensive had been started on 10 February by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the belief that there would be no French reaction. The French Air Force was the first to strike: on February 16th an air raid on Ouadi Doum badly damaged the Ouadi Doum airbase, a strategic air base in Chad from which Libyan planes could attack N'Djamena and hamper the deployment of troops. On February 17th 1986, in retaliation for the Ouadi Doum air raid, a LARAF Tu-22B attacked the airport at N'Djamena. The bomber ran into technical problems on its return journey. U.S. reconnaissance planes based in Sudan monitored distress calls sent by the pilot of the Tu-22 that probably crashed before reaching its base at Aouzou (it may have hit by twin-tubes that fired in N'Djamena airport).The Ottawa Citizen, Page A7, 18 February 1986 On February 18th, 200 French Commandos took possession of Camp Dubut, near N'Djamena, which had previously been France's headquarters during Op√©ration Manta (1983‚Äì1984). The Commandos secured the camp for the mission's air force. The air force arrived the night of the 18th and was composed of six Mirage F1, four Jaguar fighter-bombers, and a battery of low altitude (anti aircraft) Crotale missiles. To defend the capital and the camp against high altitude air attacks a battery of French Army Air Defense MIM-23 Hawk missiles arrived on March 3rd, and shortly afterwards a radar was stationed at Moussoro, defended by 150 French troops. This brought the total number of troops in the country to 900. For months the troops remained largely inactive, and the air force limited itself to reconnaissance missions for the Chadian army, remaining careful not to cross the 16th parallel. But when in October the leader of the GUNT Goukouni Oueddei rebelled against Gaddafi, and vicious fighting erupted in the Tibesti between his People's Armed Forces militia (1,500 to 2,000 men) and the Libyan army, who had 8,000 men in Chad, the situation changed. Overwhelmed by superior forces, Goukouni's forces were in peril; this led France to plan a mission to help the Tibesti rebels. On the night of September 16th and 17th, two Transall transport aircraft parachuted 6,000 litres of gasoline, munitions, provisions and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles into the Tibesti. It was also reported by Le Monde that a small number of French soldiers had secretly entered the Tibesti to support Goukouni's men. On 2 January 1987 Habr√©'s troops invaded the capital of the Ennedi, Fada; the battle was a triumph for the Chadians, while 781 Libyans remained on the ground. A decisive role was played by French supplies, especially the anti- tank MILAN missiles. Gaddafi answered by violating the red line of the 16th parallel; Libyan planes bombed Arada, 110 km south of the line, and Oum- Chalouba, close to a new French base established at Kala√Øt, exactly on the 16th parallel, manned by 250 troops. France's reaction was to bomb again on January 7th the airbase of Ouadi Doum: the fourteen aircraft employed in the operation destroyed the Libyan radar station, but limited themselves to this. In what appears to have been an escalation, Libyan forces raided the French- Chadian base of Kala√Øt on January 11th; it was the first direct attack on the French contingent, which suffered no losses. Additionally, Gaddafi prepared a vast offensive: he added 4,000‚Äì6,000 troops to the 8,000 men stationed in the Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti. In the meantime, the French also strengthened their forces; in February Op√©ration √âpervier reached 2,200 men and established two new bases at Biltine and Ab√©ch√© (Camp Moll), in eastern Chad. Habr√© concentrated most of his forces near Fada; and when on March 18th the Libyan offensive was at last started the result was a disaster for Gaddafi. 1,200 Libyans were killed and 500 taken prisoner, and Faya-Largeau, the main Libyan stronghold in Chad, was taken without fighting on March 27th. In this recapture of Northern Chad, France did not officially take part in the fighting; but it is believed that a special unit of the DGSE (Service Action) participated in the taking of Ouadi Doum. In May, when the French Defence Minister Alain Giraud visited the town of Faya-Largeau, the policy of respect of the 16th parallel by the French troops was declared no longer applicable. Libyan expulsion from Chad did not end the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict: the dispute over who was the rightful possessor of the Aouzou strip remained open, and when Habr√© occupied Aouzou on August 8th, the French contingent was once again involved. On August 25th, Gaddafi's forces bombed Faya-Largeau, where a French parachute regiment was stationed, but damage was minimal. Habr√© started new offensive, on September 7th a Tupolev Tu-22 was sent to bomb the capital, but the aircraft was destroyed by the French Army MIM-23 Hawk battery. A simultaneous Libyan attack on Ab√©ch√© was more successful, if not very effective, owing to the inadequacy of the French Air Force SAM Crotale battery recently deployed. France decided not to react to these attacks, to prevent an escalation. On September 11th, the Chadian and Libyan governments accept a ceasefire mediated by the OAU, which put an end to the conflict. While long negotiations between the two parties started, the French continued to fortify their positions in Chad, including completion of an air strip at Ab√©ch√© in September. The French started assuming humanitarian tasks, such as mine- clearing in northern Chad; it was during one of these missions that Op√©ration √âpervier reported on its first loss on January 14th 1988. The Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict officially came to an end in October 1988, when Chad resumed formal diplomatic relations with Libya, in accordance with recommendations made by the OAU. As a result, the French contingent started decreasing in size. Cost was another reason for a decrease in France's military presences: in 1987 alone, Op√©ration √âpervier had cost France 1,700,000 French francs. In 1989 the number of men deployed to Chad had fallen to 1,000, and many minor bases had been dismantled. New president in Chad, 1990s Habr√© was an indirect victim of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The diminished importance of Africa for French policy also brought France to become more critical of Habr√©'s bad human rights record. Habr√© moved to free himself from French tutelage by seeking friendship with the United States. Relations between Paris and N'Djamena diminished, to the point that the French decided to remain neutral in the conflict that started in April 1989 between the President and his former general Idriss D√©by. D√©by promised not to attack the French base at Ab√©ch√©, and in his march to the capital was followed by an officer of the DGSE, Paul Fontbonne. D√©by occupied the Chadian capital on 3 December 1990, with the French maintaining themselves neutral. The increasing pillaging in the city did cause the troops to react: they secured the city's key-points (the airport, the embassy, the power station) and evacuated its 1250 western civilians. With D√©by in power, while Franco-Chadian relations remained good, those with Libya deteriorated considerably. Gaddafi sent a request to D√©by for the deportation to Libya of the Haftar force, composed of former Libyan troops that had deserted. However, a secret joint operation to bring the troops to Nigeria was orchestrated by the CIA and components of Op√©ration √âpervier. Despite this failure, Chadian‚ÄìLibyan relations remained good, and the last issues among the two countries were resolved in 2004 by the International Court of Justice of The Hague, that gave the Aouzou Strip to Chad. The operation's key roles since have been logistical support in the restructuring and reduction of the Chadian army, that was reduced from 40,000 to 25,000 men, and in making possible the presidential election of 1996. Actions like the former helped the French authorities justify their presence in the country: when Amnesty International questioned them in April 1996 on this continued presence, the official answer was that Op√©ration √âpervier was being used to assist the democratic process in Chad, and also as an internal and external deterrent. In theory, Op√©ration √âpervier, originally created to contain Libyan expansionism, should have come to an end with the settlement of all issues among the two countries; but Chad came to be seen as the \\"French aircraft carrier of the desert\\", of key strategic importance as one of the five countries (the others were Djibouti, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Gabon) with a continuing French military presence in August 2002. In that period Op√©ration √âpervier could count on 951 men, deployed in the bases of Hadji Kossei near N'Djamena and that of Croci next to Ab√©ch√©. New Sudanese Threat, 2000s The threat represented by Sudan and its proxies had already brought the French forces to increase their units to 1,200 troops based near N'Djamena to protect the Chadian President Idriss D√©by's administration in the event of a large scale attack by the United Front for Democratic Change rebels or an invasion by their chief tactical and financial supporters, the Sudanese military. French involvement, which increased by 300 troops in April 2006, further complicates the Chadian‚ÄìSudanese conflict. Air support at this time consisted of six Mirage F1 fighters, three tactical transport planes, two Breguet reconnaissance planes and three Puma helicopters. Before and after the Battle of N'Djamena, French airplanes participated in reconnaissance missions to determine the scope of Sudanese involvement. The French forces also played a small but important part in the battle of N'Djamena, where they provided logistical support to the government but without taking sides in the fighting. They also provided the Chadian army with intelligence on the enemy's movements, and fired warning shots near the rebel column. In 2006, President D√©by responded to increasing instability by threatening to expel the 200,000 Sudanese Fur refugees: \\"If after June we can't guarantee the security of our citizens and the refugees, then it is up to the international community to find another country to shelter these refugees\\". On 1 August 2014, Op√©ration √âpervier was replaced by Operation Barkhane.

He also served as president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, and sat on the board of trustees for Lehigh University.  Early years  He was born in Cape May, New Jersey, the son of a sea captain John W. Grace, and Rebecca Grace. He married Marion Brown, daughter of Charles Brown, co-founder of the Brown-Borhek lumber supply company. Grace attended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and played for the university baseball team. He was considered to be one of their best players, playing shortstop and batting a .400 average. Upon graduation in 1899, at the top of his class and as valedictorian, he turned down a contract to play for the Boston Braves to work as a crane operator for Bethlehem Steel. Though his friends doubted his decision, by 1913 he had worked his way up to become president of the company, and three years later, president of the corporation.  Industrial career  Grace (Hand on Face) testifying before Congress, 1955 Grace led the company through World War I, tripling the company's steel output over the course of the war. By 1929, through several acquisitions, the company operated nine major steel plants. He is quoted as saying \\"Gentlemen, we are going to make a lot of money.\\" when informed of the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He was right, as Bethlehem Steel quickly became one of the major steel suppliers of the war, as well as constructing many ships for the United States Navy. In 1941, he received the second highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $522,637. During his career, Grace earned a reputation for strident anti-unionism. After the war, Grace led the company to retool for peace time, and they changed focus to building bridges, including the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and skyscrapers. Grace was generous with the money he earned, and donated much to Lehigh University and the city of Bethlehem. He retired from the company in 1957. He died in 1960, and was buried in Nisky Hill Cemetery in a site overlooking the steel plant in south Bethlehem.

It is named after William Saunders. William Saunders was a Canadian pioneer and an authority on all matters pertaining to agriculture and horticulture. Grades offered are 9‚Äì12. Saunders' school colours are red and gold and its mascot is a sabre-tooth tiger. Saunders Secondary School is the largest high school in the Thames Valley District School Board with close to 2000 students and 120 teachers. As of 2008, Saunders is also the site of new credit summer school for the TVDSB.  History  Classes for Saunders began in portables at Westminster S.S. in 1970. Construction of Saunders was completed in 1972. The school cost more than $8 million to build. The location caused many heated debates. The people of Byron, Ontario had been promised, upon amalgamation with the city of London, Ontario, a secondary school in their area so that their children would not have to be bused to the Westmount area. The chosen site for the multimillion-dollar school ‚Äì right in the heart of the Westmount area, across the street from the Westmount Mall ‚Äì greatly angered the Byron Area Secondary School Association. In spite of this, in January 1969, the London Board of Education approved the Westmount location for the school. On April 18, 1994, arsonists set fire to Saunders forcing the evacuation and temporary closure of the school, as well as an extensive rebuilding of the rear part of the building. London Police subsequently charged three students with setting the blaze. Saunders recently underwent an exterior renovation, the first new construction at the school in over three decades. A new entryway was added on the north-east corner of the building along with the fire escape stairs at the south and on the north-west corner of the school, contrasting modern with brutalist architecture.  Tech programs  Saunders has been recognized as having one of the most developed and diversified programs in London. Current tech programs include: photography, broadcasting, electrical, computer engineering (offering CCNA & A+ certifications), woodworking, automotive, autobody, drafting graphic design, machine shop, welding and a newly added art welding course. Notably, Saunders offers co-operative education in the above courses as well as: science, physical education, family studies, business and administration, computer programming, and others.  Musical theatre  Saunders is one of the only schools in the TVDSB that offers the musical theatre performance course, another being H.B. Beal. One difference between the two schools' programs is the rotation. While Beal takes a 2 show-break schedule, Saunders does a big show on the main stage, and then a smaller show in the drama studio, alternating each year. The shows that have been performed are: *Little Shop of Horrors *Godspell *Snow White *Chicago *Groovy *Bye Bye Birdie *The Wedding Singer *The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee *Annie *The Wizard of Oz *Grease * Fame  Sports  The senior boys' volleyball team won both TVRAA and OFSAA in AAAA for the fourth straight year in 2007, the only team in Ontario history to accomplish this feat. Saunders is considered one of the best volleyball high schools in Canada, having many of the provinces' elite young players. The Saunders junior football team won the city championships in 2007 for the first time in ten years.

Very little is known about N. thorelii and it is unlikely to have entered cultivation, although various other taxa are often mislabelled as this species in the plant trade.Mey, F.S. 2010. In: S.R. McPherson Carnivorous Plants and their Habitats. Volume 2. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 1340‚Äì1367. Prior to its rediscovery in 2011, N. thorelii was considered possibly extinct, both in the wild and in cultivation.Ziemer, B. 2010. Exciting conservation news: The Rare Nepenthes Collection project! Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 39(3): 67. Botanical history The first known collection of N. thorelii was made by Clovis Thorel between 1862 and 1866Specimen Details: Nepenthes thorelii Lecomte. The New York Botanical Garden. from Ti- tinh, Lo-thieu, Guia-Toan, Vietnam.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. During this time, Thorel collected a number of specimens of N. thorelii, all of which have been designated as Thorel 1032. One of these specimens, the lectotype, is a male plant with lower pitchers. It is deposited at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, together with one isotype: a female specimen with upper pitchers. A second isotype is held at Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the herbarium of the Bogor Botanical Gardens. An additional specimen of Thorel 1032 is deposited at the New York Botanical Garden. The female isotype deposited at the Paris herbarium Nepenthes thorelii was formally described in 1909 by French botanist Paul Henri Lecomte, who named it after Thorel. The description was published in Lecomte's Notulae systematicae. Since then, one infraspecific taxon of N. thorelii has appeared in print; Nepenthes thorelii f. rubra was mentioned by Leo C. Song in a 1979 article published in the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter,Song, L.C. 1979. Nepenthes crosses made at California State University, Fullerton. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 8(1): 13. but is considered a nomen nudum.Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes thorelii. Carnivorous Plant Database. In 1983, Bruce Lee Bednar wrote that cultivated plants labelled as N. kampotiana were thought to represent a natural hybrid between N. mirabilis and N. thorelii, and that these appeared on some lists under the unofficial name N. √ó lecouflei.Bednar, B. 1983. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 12(3): 64. Bednar noted that a plant known in the horticultural trade as \\"thorelii-long green\\" was considered by many to be a Thailand form of N. mirabilis, while another plant called \\"short round\\", which had pubescent leaves and squat pitchers, might represent the true N. thorelii. If this were the case, it would mean that artificial crosses such as N. 'Hachijo' and N. 'Effulgent Koto' are intergrades of N. mirabilis as opposed to hybrids. In their 1997 monograph on the genus Nepenthes, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek designated the male specimen deposited at the Paris herbarium as the lectotype of N. thorelii. The authors noted that there are \\"problems with the delimitation\\" of N. thorelii and the related taxa N. anamensis and N. smilesii (which are now considered conspecific).McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Catalano, M. 2010. Nepenthes della Thailandia: Diario di viaggio. Prague.

Description Nepenthes thorelii is a shrub with an erect stem having a smooth circular cross section and a tapering form. The stem reaches 40 cm in height and is 4 to 8 mm in diameter. The species has a well-developed perennial rootstock that produces shoots every wet season. The rootstock is irregularly branched and measures up to 2 cm in width. A closeup of the stem and leaves of the lectotype Leaves vary in shape from linear-lanceolate to narrowly obovate. The lamina or leaf blade measures up to 26 cm in length by 3 cm in width. Its apex is acute to acuminate. The base of the lamina is amplexicaul and decurrent into two wings that extend up to 2.5 cm down the stem. The ends of these wings are rounded such that they almost touch. Two to four longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are numerous and curve towards the apex of the lamina. Rosette and lower pitchers are ovoid in shape and measure up to 11.5 cm in height by 4.5 cm in width. They are light green with reddish markings and a reddish lid. A pair of wings up to 8 mm wide runs down the front of each pitcher. These wings bear fringe elements up to 5 mm long and spaced around 2 mm apart. The pitcher mouth is ovate-triangular and has an oblique insertion. The peristome is rounded at the front and ranges in width from 2 to 4 mm at the front to 7 mm at the rear. It bears a series of ribs spaced 0.25 to 0.4 mm apart. The inner margin of the peristome is lined with rounded teeth measuring 0.2 to 0.5 mm. The lid or operculum is ovate to rounded in shape and up to 3.5 cm long by 2.8 cm wide. Numerous prominently lipped glands are present on the underside of the lid, particularly near the base of the midrib, where they are 0.3 to 0.7 mm wide. Glands become less dense and smaller (around 0.15 mm wide) towards the margins. An unbranched spur measuring 2 to 4 mm is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers arise from uncurled tendrils. They are obovate, becoming narrower towards the mouth. They are similar in size to their lower counterparts, reaching 12.5 cm in height by 4.5 cm in width. In aerial pitchers, the broad wings of the lower pitchers are reduced to narrow structures only 1 to 1.5 mm wide, with shorter acuminate fringe elements (‚â§1.5 mm long) spaced 3 to 7 mm apart. As in lower pitchers, the pitcher mouth is oblique and concave. The peristome is rounded and 3 to 5 mm wide, with a regularly undulate outer margin. The lid is similar to that of the lower pitchers. Nepenthes thorelii has a large racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is 8 to 18 cm long, while the rachis is 50 to 70 cm long. Partial peduncles are one-flowered. Pedicels are up to 6 mm long and may or may not be shortly bracteate. The species has an indumentum of simple or branched white hairs between 0.3 and 0.4 mm long. The diploid chromosome number of N. thorelii is 78 according to a 1969 paper by Katsuhiko Kondo.Kondo, K. 1969. Chromosome numbers of carnivorous plants. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 96(3): 322‚Äì328. However, a 1997 study by G√ºnther Rudolf Heubl and Andreas Wistuba found the chromosome number to be 80,Heubl, G.R. & A. Wistuba 1997. A cytological study of the genus Nepenthes L. (Nepenthaceae). Sendtnera 4: 169‚Äì174. and this is now accepted as the diploid number of all species in the genus.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. A plant matching the description of N. thorelii, growing in grassland at 0‚Äì200 m Ecology Nepenthes thorelii is known with certainty only from Vietnam, where the type specimen was collected.Mey, F.S., L.H. Truong, D.V. Dai & A.S. Robinson 2011. Nepenthes thorelii, an emended description and novel ecological data resulting from its rediscovery in Tay Ninh, Vietnam. In: McPherson, S.R.

Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes thorelii occurs in seasonally dry savannah grassland from sea level to an elevation of 200 m. During the dry season it is believed to survive as a dormant rootstock while bushfires burn any above-ground vegetation. New shoots are produced annually with the advent of the wet season.Kurata, S. 1976. Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu. Sabah National Parks Publications No. 2, Sabah National Parks Trustees, Kota Kinabalu. Since the extent of its natural range is uncertain, N. thorelii is listed as Data Deficient on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species based on an assessment carried out in 2000. Related species Preserved upper pitchers of N. thorelii, showing the characteristic uncurled tendrils of this species N. mirabilis √ó N. thorelii, showing a lower pitcher intermediate in appearance between its parent species Nepenthes thorelii is closely related to the Indochinese species N. smilesii. These two taxa share several morphological features, such as narrow linear leaf blades and leaf bases that clasp the stem. In addition, N. smilesii may grow in similar habitats to N. thorelii. Distinguishing features of N. thorelii include the large rootstock that allows it to perennate through dry and wet seasons, the uncurled tendrils of upper pitchers, and its large inflorescence. However, the extent of the variation of the Indochinese species is unknown, making them difficult to circumscribe. Nepenthes thorelii is also allied to N. bokorensis of Cambodia, from which it differs in several aspects of vegetative morphology. Firstly, the lamina of N. bokorensis is sessile to sub-petiolate and only slightly decurrent down the stem, if at all.Mey, F.S. 2009. Carniflora Australis 7(1): 6‚Äì15. In comparison, N. thorelii has an amplexicaul leaf attachment and the base of the lamina is decurrent into two wings that extend up to 2.5 cm down the stem. In addition, N. thorelii has wholly ovoid lower pitchers, whereas those of N. bokorensis are only ovate in the basal third, becoming cylindrical above. In his Carnivorous Plant Database, taxonomist Jan Schlauer treats N. suratensis as a possible heterotypic synonym of N. thorelii.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes suratensis. Carnivorous Plant Database. Natural hybrids Putative natural hybrids between N. mirabilis and N. thorelii have been recorded.Mey, F.S. 2012. Virtual Nepenthes herbarium on \\"Europeana\\".

Mainly a landscape painter, his style can be considered as neo-figurative although his synthesis of forms lead a considerable abstract approach to nature depiction. His landscapes are always meditative and silent with an \\"earthy\\" feeling within it (often only one quarter of the painting is occupied by the sky) using for example in his preparatory studies close-up photographs of particular rocks that would later form mountains or rocky landscapes. left He was also an important printmaker, especially in woodcut, and giving along with other contemporary artists an impulse to the growth and teaching of this art form, almost forgotten in his time in Portugal.

He is known for the discovery of the Faddeev equations in the theory of the quantum mechanical three-body problem and for the development of path integral methods in the quantization of non-abelian gauge field theories, including the introduction (with Victor Popov) of Faddeev‚ÄìPopov ghosts. He led the Leningrad School, in which he along with many of his students developed the quantum inverse scattering method for studying quantum integrable systems in one space and one time dimension. This work led to the invention of quantum groups by Drinfeld and Jimbo. Biography Faddeev was born in Leningrad to a family of mathematicians. His father, Dmitry Faddeev, was a well known algebraist, professor of Leningrad University and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. His mother, Vera Faddeeva, was known for her work in numerical linear algebra. Faddeev attended Leningrad University, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1956. He enrolled in physics, rather than mathematics, \\"to be independent of [his] father\\". Nevertheless, he received a solid education in mathematics as well \\"due to the influence of V. A. Fock and V. I. Smirnov\\". His doctoral work, on scattering theory, was completed in 1959 under the direction of Olga Ladyzhenskaya. From 1976 to 2000, Faddeev was head of the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences (PDMI RAS). He was an invited visitor to the CERN Theory Division for the first time in 1973 and made several further visits there. In 1988 he founded the Euler International Mathematical Institute, now a department of PDMI RAS. Honours and awards Faddeev was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1976, and was a member of a number of foreign academies, including the U. S. National Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society. He received numerous honors including USSR State Prize (1971), Dannie Heineman Prize (1975), Dirac Prize (1990), an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Mathematics and Science at Uppsala University, Sweden, Max Planck Medal (1996), Demidov Prize (2002 - \\"For outstanding contribution to the development of mathematics, quantum mechanics, string theory and solitons\\") and the State Prize of the Russian Federation (1995, 2004). He was president of the International Mathematical Union (1986‚Äì1990). He was awarded the Henri Poincar√© Prize in 2006 and the Shaw Prize in mathematical sciences in 2008. Also the Karpinsky International Prize and the Max Planck Medal (German Physical Society). He also received the Lomonosov Gold Medal for 2013. Faddeev also received state awards: * Order of Merit for the Fatherland; **3rd class (25 October 2004) - for outstanding contribution to the development of fundamental and applied domestic science and many years of fruitful activity **4th class (4 June 1999) - for outstanding contribution to the development of national science and training of highly qualified personnel in connection with the 275th anniversary of the Russian Academy of Sciences * Order of Friendship (6 June 1994) - for his great personal contribution to the development of mathematical physics and training of highly qualified scientific personnel * Order of Lenin * Order of the Red Banner of Labour * State Prize of the Russian Federation in Science and Technology 2004 (6 June 2005), for outstanding achievement in the development of mathematical physics and in 1995 for science and technology (20 June 1995), for the monograph \\"Introduction to quantum gauge field theory\\" * USSR State Prize (1971) * Honorary citizen of St. Petersburg (2010) * Academician (Finland) (1991) Selected works Source:Scientific publications of L.

The scheme was run jointly by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA). Details The VIC applied only to cars, and was intended to ensure that a vehicle registration certificate (V5C) was not issued for a stolen or cloned vehicle taking the identity of a destroyed vehicle. When a car was written off by an insurance company as \\"category C\\" or higher, then checking was required before a V5C could be issued.Code of Practice for the Disposal of Motor Vehicle Salvage, Association of British Insurers, March 2007. Category D vehicles did not require inspection. The test, carried out by VOSA, determined whether or not a car presented was the same one that was listed against DVLA records. To apply for a check, a VIC1 form had to be completed and submitted to VOSA. A car bought with no V5C might also require a VIC, even if there had been no insurance claim, to confirm its identify before a new V5C was issued. The VIC was not a check on any repairs carried out to the car, and did not certify its roadworthiness or mechanical safety, which was part of the MOT test. Closure Up to July 2012, an estimated 900,000 vehicles had been tested under the scheme. However, only 38 \\"ringers\\" or cloned vehicles had been successfully identified. The VIC scheme officially closed on 26 October 2015. Since then, the conditions for issue of a V5C are that the vehicle has obtained an MOT test certificate, be roadworthy, and have insurance.

Botanical history Nepenthes neoguineensis was first collected in 1828 by Alexander Zipelius near Triton Bay, New Guinea. Two further collections were made by on June 19 and September 25, 1907. N. neoguineensis was again collected on May 10, 1910, by Knud Gjellerup.Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. The first name applied to this species was Nepenthes leptoptera by Hermann Zippel in 1900. However, this name is not valid as it only appeared on the label of a herbarium specimen (HLB.908.154-597) deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes leptoptera. Carnivorous Plant Database. The specimen was collected from New Guinea. Nepenthes neoguineensis was described by John Muirhead Macfarlane in 1911 based on the specimen Versteeg 1746, which consists of female plant material. In 1916, Henry Nicholas Ridley described what he believed represented a male plant of N. neoguineensis. However, in his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", B. H. Danser showed that it belonged to a closely related but distinct species, which he named N. papuana. Description Nepenthes neoguineensis is a climbing plant. The stem is up to 6 mm thick and cylindrical to obtusely angular in cross section, especially in the upper part of the internodes. Internodes are up to 4 cm long. Climbing stems with inflorescences Leaves are chartaceous and petiolate. The lamina is lanceolate and reaches 25 cm in length and 4.5 cm in width. It has an acute apex and is gradually or rather abruptly attenuate towards the base. Three or four indistinct longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins ascend obliquely from the midrib and are irregularly reticulate in the outer part of the lamina. Tendrils are up to 4 mm thick and about as long as the lamina. Upper pitchers gradually arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 7 to 23 mm wide curve. They are infundibulate in the lower part, somewhat ventricose at two-fifths of their height, and widened towards the mouth. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§8 mm wide) runs down the entire length of the pitcher. The pitcher mouth is oblique and acuminate towards the lid. The peristome is cylindrical or flattened and up to 1.5 mm wide. The glandular region covers the lower third of the inner surface of the pitcher. The glands occur at a density of about 700 to 900 per square centimetre. The lid is suborbicular, truncate or slightly emarginate, and rounded or slightly cordate at the base. Round, depressed glands are present on the undersurface of the lid, being concentrated and increasing in size towards the middle. A flattened, unbranched spur (‚â§3 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. Upper pitchers The male inflorescence is a long, cylindrical panicle. The peduncle reaches 12 cm in length and 4 mm in width. The rachis is attenuate and up to 44 cm long. Pedicels lack bracteoles, reach 55 mm in length, and are one- to four-flowered. Tepals are orbicular-elliptical and around 4 mm long. Stamens are about 4 mm long, including the anthers. The female inflorescence is a panicle-like raceme. The peduncle may be up to 15 cm long and 2.5 mm wide. The rachis is attenuate and reaches 20 cm in length. Pedicels are up to 35 mm long and most have filiform bracteoles. They are one- to three-flowered. Tepals are oblong-lanceolate and approximately 4 mm long. The ovary is sessile. Nepenthes neoguineensis has a very sparse indumentum. The stem is virtually glabrous, as is the lamina. Tendrils are densely hirsute when young, becoming only hairy near the pitcher or entirely glabrous when mature. Pitchers have a dense covering of caducous stellate hairs. The exception is the spur, which has persistent stellate hairs. Inflorescences have a very dense indumentum of short, white or brownish stellate hairs. The pedicels, tepals and the ovary are very densely stellate-tomentose. Lower pitchers range in colour from light green to dark purple throughout. Upper pitchers are generally yellowish-green, often with a darker peristome and bright red lid. Herbarium specimens are fallow-dun in colour. Ecology Nepenthes neoguineensis growing in a clay-based substrate Nepenthes neoguineensis is native to New Guinea and the nearby D'Entrecasteaux Islands, and may also occur on Misool (see N. sp. Misool).McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Australia and New Guinea. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The species is relatively widespread in New Guinea, ranging across the entire length of the island and occurring in both Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian portion of the island (Western New Guinea). As such, its conservation status is listed as Least Concern on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Nepenthes neoguineensis grows on river edges, river gravel bars, ridge crests, and rarely in open grassland or disturbed forest. It has a wide altitudinal distribution, occurring from sea- level to an elevation of , occasionally .Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. In the wild, N. neoguineensis occurs sympatrically with N. ampullaria and N. maxima. Related species An upper pitcher of N. papuana Danser considered N. tomoriana from Sulawesi and N. distillatoria from Sri Lanka to be the closest relatives of N. neoguineensis. He also noted its similarity to N. papuana, stating: \\"N. papuana is so much alike N. neoguineensis in its vegetative parts, that only the complete knowledge of the generative parts has suggested me to establish a new species\\". The two taxa can be distinguished on the basis of several morphological features. N. papuana has a racemose inflorescence, while that of N. neoguineensis is a panicle or panicle-like raceme. Furthermore, the inflorescence of N. papuana usually bears only one-flowered pedicels, both in male and female plants. Those of N. neoguineensis can be up to four-flowered. The lamina of N. papuana has very distinct longitudinal veins and indistinct pinnate veins, whereas in N. neoguineensis the opposite is true. In addition, the leaves of N. papuana are very densely ciliate, much more so than in N. neoguineensis. The wings are less developed in the upper pitchers of N. papuana and the fringe elements are more closely spaced. Based on the structure of its inflorescence, it has been suggested that N. neoguineensis belongs to a group of relatively primitive Nepenthes species, which includes N. distillatoria and N. pervillei.Nerz, J. Nepenthes neoguineensis. Joachim-Nerz.de. Natural hybrids Where their ranges overlap, N. neoguineensis is known to hybridise with N. ampullaria and N. maxima.McPherson, S.R. 2009.

It includes, the Bachelor's Program for Adults and Transfer Students, Milano School of Policy, Management, and Environment founded in 1964, School of Media Studies, Creative Writing Program, the Julien J. Studley Graduate Programs in International Affairs, and School of Languages.  History  The Schools of Public Engagement at The New School is the direct successor of the original institution making it the oldest division of The New School having been founded in 1919. The school‚Äôs founding members wanted to create a ‚Äúcenter for discussion and instruction for mature men and women‚Äù and by 1934 it was chartered as a university by the state of New York and began conferring degrees. The division was restructured in September 2011 after it would include both Milano School of Management and Urban Policy and what was then called The New School for General Studies. =Growth and change= Dean Allen Austill led the division from the 1960s to the 1980s. Austill was assisted by Albert Landa, who directed publicity for the New School while also informally acting in many other capacities, and Wallis Osterholz, who was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration. Austill also added areas as guitar study and culinary science to the curriculum. In 1962, Austill initiated the Institute for Retired Professionals, a community of peer learners aged 50 to 90 who develop and participate in challenging discussion groups; the Institute, now headed by Michael Markowitz, still exists today. Austill's subordinate as Chair of Humanities for many of these years was Reuben Abel, a philosopher. Abel was succeeded by Lewis Falb, a specialist in interwar Paris who broadened the humanities curriculum further. Prominent teachers in this era included the philosopher Paul Edwards; the literary scholars Hasye Cooperman, Justus Rosenberg, and Margaret Boe Birns; the political scientist Ralph Buultjens; and the visual arts instructors Anthony Toney, Minoru Kawabata, and Henry C. Pearson. = The 1990s and after = The New School, for most of its history, operated as a noncredit institution, serving largely white, middle-class, often politically progressive, often Jewish adults living in Manhattan who were interested in intellectual stimulation and self-improvement. In the early 1990s, the institution, sensing demographic changes and needing to supplement its revenue, began to encourage credit students to matriculate at the institution, a trend which culminated in the establishment of the adult BA program in the mid-1990s. The credit students generally represented a younger and more diverse population. The New School possesses a prestigious MFA program in creative writing, directed by Luis Jaramillo, that has featured such authors as Rick Moody, Colm Toibin, and Marie Ponsot as instructors. The division also has an MA/MS program in International Affairs, directed by Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and, until 2007, hosted the World Policy Institute, a well-regarded foundation devoted to the study of foreign affairs and formerly led by Stephen Schlesinger. Several important developments occurred at the institution in the early 2000s. A strong advising program guided the curriculum's transformation from an intellectual free-for-all of courses often taught by teachers with sharply varying credentials to a smaller, more rigorous set of offerings taught by professionals, often bearing the highest degree in their fields. In 2005, as part of the rebranding of the entire university envisioned by President Bob Kerrey, the division was renamed The New School for General Studies, to clarify its mission and perhaps to invite comparisons with Columbia University's prestigious, similarly named School of General Studies. Also in 2005, the New School agreed to a contract with Local 7902 of ACT-UAW, an affiliate of the United Auto Workers, guaranteeing job security to part-time faculty who had taught at The New School for more than ten semesters. Following the part-time faculty's success in gaining recognition and security, New School students set about creating a university- wide representative body. Many efforts had been made to establish a student legislative body, to address student grievances and concerns, but they were stymied by disconnected university divisions and an unenthusiastic administration. However, the long-standing efforts finally paid off in the Fall 2006 term when a University-wide Student Senate was formed involving representatives from all of the school's divisions. The USS gained administration support and funding from the board of trustees and is set to ratify a new constitution.

It featured a new 3D accelerated graphics engine at the time of its release. The game contains over 20 missions, with access to 18 different mechs. A novelization called Trial Under Fire was written by Loren L. Coleman.  Gameplay  Mechwarrior 3 is a first-person mecha simulation game, where the player pilots a Mech in each mission. Mechs are giant armored robots and fitted with various projectile and energy weapons. Mechs engage in combat with other mechs as well as traditional military vehicles such as tanks, helicopters, and occasional weapon emplacements. During combat a Mech's weapons and critical components can be damaged, and it is even possible for entire limbs to be blown off of a Mech. Mech customization is a major aspect of gameplay. The player has near total control over the configuration of each of his or her Mechs. From the type and amount of armor used to various internal components, and all of the Mech's weaponry and ammunition. In the campaign additional parts, weapons, and ammunition are acquired through the missions, captured supplies, and salvaged enemy Mechs. Also in the campaign, the player controls up to three squadmates, with the ability to issue basic orders such as attack, move, and return to the Mobile Field Bases (MFBs) for repairs. The Mobile Field Bases are a unique feature not seen in any other Mechwarrior game. The player starts the game with three MFBs, although these can be destroyed. The MFBs travel with the player throughout the missions advancing when ordered to by the player. They carry all the player's supplies, which means there is a weight limit to the amount of supplies the player can keep. The MFBs can provide field repair and resupply provided they are carrying suffient armor and ammunition. As Mechs do not have shields, and are only protected by armor which is damaged in combat, the MFBs can become crucial in enabling the player to complete a mission.  Plot  The story opens with a short briefing of the Inner Sphere's Operation: Bulldog, a daring plan to eliminate the most hostile and vicious clan in the Inner Sphere: Clan Smoke Jaguar, led by Anastasius Focht and Victor Steiner-Davion. Operation Bulldog and Task Force Serpent have already completed their objectives, but there is one last operation left‚Äîthe one with which the player is tasked‚Äîthe disruption of a ranking Smoke Jaguar officer's attempt to rally and restore the Clan forces. This mission (codename: Damocles) is to destroy key Smoke Jaguar installations on the planet Tranquil, including a mech factory, a starport, a geothermal power plant, and the Smoke Jaguar control structure. The mission is a commando operation with limited forces, and does not include elimination of the enemy as an objective. Two dropships are deployed to release the BattleMech force to destroy these installations. However, while in orbit above Tranquil, a dropship is attacked by naval laser fire. The Blackhammer is shot down and the remaining dropship, the Eclipse, retreats to safety. The player was already deployed from the dropship, which had been slightly off target before it was destroyed. The Mobile Field Bases (MFB), which were deployed at the same time as the player, land on target. The player's first mission is to rendezvous with the MFBs and secure the area from hostile forces. At least seven Mechs are deployed. Two are destroyed by the enemy near the beginning of the game and one toward the end. The novelization mentions one more casualty lost due to a parachute malfunction. The remaining four survivors gradually link up over the course of the game. Twelve more Mechs remain aboard the Eclipse, but they cannot be deployed directly, and an attempt to fight through from a safe landing area fails after heavy casualties. Despite this setback, the player must continue with his objectives, and eventually secure a Clan shuttle to rendezvous with the Eclipse in low orbit.  Pirate's Moon (expansion pack)  In-game screenshot of Mechwarrior 3 with a 'Puma' Light Mech and a 'Thor' Heavy Mech MechWarrior 3: Pirate's Moon is the only expansion pack for MechWarrior 3, with an all new storyline and 20 new missions, plus six new mechs, brand new terrains, and a number of weapons. The player can select either Campaign Missions or Pirate Missions which contain respective stories. = Campaign = The Lance Leader from MechWarrior 3 is now given an official name known as 'Lieutenant Connor Sinclair' and returns as main protagonist of the campaign missions. Sinclair is assigned to protect the Federated Suns' control over the planet Vale and its resources against New Belt Pirates led by Susie Ryan. During the confrontation, Sinclair and his lancemates encounter overwhelming pirate forces unexpectedly and explore for the further plot to be unveiled. = Pirate Missions = The player controls 'Scourge', the New Belt Pirate working for Susie Ryan as the forces attempt to attack the Federated Suns' defense and claim control over the resources on Vale. Reception =Sales= MechWarrior 3 was heavily promoted in the lead-up to its release. In the United States, it debuted at #2 on PC Data's computer game sales rankings for May 30‚ÄìJune 5, 1999. The title rose to first place the following week, then remained in the top 10 from June 13‚ÄìJuly 10. It took positions 1 and 9, respectively, for June and July overall. MechWarrior 3s sales had risen to 99,000 units in the United States by the end of July, according to PC Data. Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter reported that these figures were \\"good but certainly not what Hasbro Interactive hoped for.\\" Alongside the underperformance of Starsiege and Heavy Gear II, the sales of MechWarrior 3 led Asher to speculate that \\"the mecha market just isn't as big as we thought.\\" MechWarrior 3 was absent from PC Data's weekly top 10 by the week ending July 17, and charted 16th for August before exiting the monthly top 20. In September 2000, Asher wrote that \\"the evidence seems to be piling up that games that require anything more than a keyboard and mouse for a control setup suffer at the cash register, [but] the FASA license is as strong as ever. Hasbro Interactive expects to sell about 200,000 copies of MechWarrior 3 this year alone.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20010418022824/http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/Textonly/0,78,0-4751,00.html =Reviews and awards= MechWarrior 3 and the expansion pack Pirate's Moon garnered generally positive reviews, and hold an average scores of 82% and 76% respectively on aggregate web site GameRankings. John Lee reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Sorry, guys.

The station, inaugurated on December 20, 1882, is located in the barrio of Balvanera immediately north of Plaza Miserere, a large public square. The station is named after the September 11, 1852, rebellion of Buenos Aires against the Federal government of General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Coincidentally President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento also died on September 11 (1888), but contrary to popular belief in Argentina, this is not the date commemorated by the station's name. History =Background and first buildings= The original Del Parque railway station of the Buenos Aires Western Railway. Sarmiento Line Trenes Argeninos train at the station. H line subway entrance. Ticket office and schedule board. The Buenos Aires Western Railway was the first railway line of Argentina, having been opened in August 1857 joining Del Parque station (where currently Plaza Lavalle is located) to Flores district of Buenos Aires through 10-km. length. The first intermediate stop was named \\"Once de Septiembre\\". That first Once de Septiembre station was a modest building made of wood and placed on Bartolom√© Mitre street. It had only one platform and some warehouses to store wood and other materials. The increasing growth of Buenos Aires as a consequence of mass immigration to Argentina meant the closure of Del Parque railway station, therefore Once became the terminus. A new building was built for that purpose, which was inaugurated on January 1, 1883. The building was made of wood.Arquitectura Ferroviaria by Jorge Tartarini, Google books The continuous expansion of Buenos Aires produced a growth of road traffic with a large number of trams and carriages in the city. By the 1890s new groups of immigrants established near Once station. The original terminal, an unassuming clapboard structure, was ordered to be replaced by larger facilities following its 1890 purchase by the Buenos Aires Western Railway. Designed by architect John Doyer, the new, Renaissance Revival terminal was built in two stages, from 1895 to 1898, and then from 1906 to 1907; refurbishment works completed in 1972 removed most of the terminal's ornate, cast-iron roof trusses (though these are still visible in the adjoining subway station). =Rail accidents= On February 22, 2012, a commuter train entered Once station traveling at an excessive speed, about 26 km/h, and crashed into the buffers at the end of the line, killing 51 people and injuring at least 703. A similar, though less severe, incident took place on the morning of October 19, 2013, when a commuter train crashed into the buffers and landed on the platform above. Passengers reported that the conductor was speeding from Caballito Station (the previous stop); a crowd of passengers surrounded the control booth following the crash yelling \\"murderer\\", though the conductor had already fled. The conductor, Julio Ben√≠tez, was arrested after he was found with the train event recorder hidden in his backpack; Ben√≠tez had attempted to destroy the device. Services Estaci√≥n Once handles both long-distance and local passenger trains. The publicly owned provincial railway company Ferrobaires operates trains over four principal rail lines which fan out west over the surrounding Buenos Aires Province. Destinations include Pehuaj√≥, Bragado, Bahia Blanca and points between. Additionally, the commuter rail State-owned company Trenes Argentinos S.E. operates a regular train service to the suburbs of Buenos Aires along the branches of its Sarmiento Line to destinations including Moreno, Luj√°n, Lobos, and Mercedes. The station is accessible by numerous public bus services and by the A line of the Buenos Aires Underground via its \\"Plaza Miserere\\" station. Estaci√≥n Once underwent extensive renovations prior to 2007, when the new H line of the metro reached the heavily transited terminal.

Biography Aleksandr Akimov was born on 6 May 1953 in Novosibirsk, Russian SFSR (Republic of the Soviet Union). In 1976, Akimov graduated from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, with the degree of specialist in engineering and automation of heat and power processes. He began his career at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in September 1979. During his first years at Chernobyl, he held positions of senior turbine management engineer and shift supervisor of the turbine hall. On 10 July 1984 Akimov was appointed to the position of shift supervisor of Reactor Unit 4. Chernobyl disaster On the night of 26 April 1986, Akimov was on duty as the shift supervisor of the 4th power unit. The reactor power level had been reduced, preparing for a planned safety test. Akimov refused to do the test due to its low and unstable condition but was overruled by Anatoly Dyatlov. However, the power reduction had been too abrupt, which put the reactor into a \\"poisoned\\" condition (a buildup of 135Xe, a strong neutron absorber), and made the reactor stall. Raising power after this point put the reactor into a potentially dangerous state, unbeknownst to the operators. The turbine was shut down. The test was completed and the AZ-5 (\\"scram\\") button was pressed to shut down the reactor. The control rods had graphite moderators to speed up reaction, and the other part of the rods were made of boron to decrease reaction. As the rods were being inserted, the graphite tips of the control rods accelerated the reaction, creating neutron flux in the bottom of the core. This further increase in power caused the reactor to explode. The communications networks were suddenly flooded with calls and information. Akimov heard reports of massive reactor damage, but did not believe it, and as a result, relayed false information about the state of the reactor for hours thereafter. Akimov worked with his crew in the reactor building after he learned the extent of the accident. They would try to pump water into the exposed reactor core until the morning hours of the 27th. Unknown to Akimov, he was exposed during his work to a lethal dose of 15 Gy of radiation. At some point he gave deathbed confessions stating repeatedly: ‚ÄúI did everything correctly. I don't understand why it happened.‚Äù Akimov eventually succumbed to acute radiation syndrome two weeks after the disaster at the age of 33. Recognition In 2008, Akimov was posthumously awarded with the 3rd degree Order For Courage by Viktor Yushchenko, then the President of Ukraine. He was portrayed by actor Aleksandr Khoroshko in the 2004 Zero Hour television series, by Alex Lowe in the 2006 BBC production Surviving Disaster: Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster and by Sam Troughton in the 2019 HBO miniseries Chernobyl.

General Casimir Pulaski and Kovats are together known as the \\"Founding Fathers of the US Cavalry.\\" Early life Kovats was born Kov√°ts Mih√°ly in Karcag, Hungary. In English historical records his family name is sometimes spelled \\"Kowatz\\" or \\"Kowatsch\\". A nobleman, he became an officer in the Hungarian cavalry under Maria Theresa. He later became captain in the Prussian Cavalry, serving under Frederick the Great and earning the highest distinction in the Prussian Army, the Pour le M√©rite. Correspondence with Benjamin Franklin In 1777, after learning about the American Revolution, he offered his sword to the American ambassador in France, Benjamin Franklin. In a letter that has since become famous, he wrote in Latin: > Most Illustrious Sir: Golden freedom cannot be purchased with yellow gold. > I, who have the honor to present this letter to your Excellency, am also > following the call of the Fathers of the Land, as the pioneers of freedom > always did.

Military career in America Upon his arrival in America, Kov√°ts joined Count Casimir Pulaski, who was then brigadier general and commander-in-chief of Washington's cavalry. Pulaski's cavalry was poorly trained. Few trained cavalry officers made the task of commanding the forces formidable. On February 4, 1778, Pulaski proposed a plan for the formation of a training division of hussars. In a letter to Washington Pulaski wrote: \\"There is an officer now in this Country whose name is Kovach. I know him to have served with reputation in the Prussian service and assure Your Excellency that he is in every way equal to his undertaking.\\" Later, in another letter to Washington dated March 19, Pulaski again recommended Kovats: \\"I would propose, for my subaltern, an experienced officer, by name Kowacz, formerly a Colonel and partisan in the Prussian service.\\"http://www.americanhungarianfederation.org/news_michael_kovats_de_fabricy.htm Pulaski's Legion was commissioned by the Continental Congress on March 28, 1778, and Michael Kov√°ts was named colonel commandant of the legion on April 18, 1778. He was finally allowed to perform the task he had initially been intended: to organize and train hussar regiments for the American army. The recruiting of men began almost immediately, and by October 1778, the legion consisted of 330 officers and men. Kov√°ts trained these men in the tradition of Hungarian hussars: in basic form, training and organization, they were similar to their European counterparts. In October, the legion was transferred to New Jersey and sent into battle with the British at Osborne Island on the 10th and Egg Harbor on the 14th. With winter's approach, the legion was ordered to Cole's Fort, where they spent the first part of the winter in training. On February 2, 1779, the army marched to South Carolina to join the forces of General Benjamin Lincoln. During the long march, smallpox took its toll: only 150 soldiers arrived in Charleston‚Äîmore than half of the legion had died of disease along the way. The Siege of Charleston was underway. The situation was critical, the population urged for surrender. Pulaski's legion arrived on May 8, 1779, and unsuccessfully attacked the British troops led by General Prevost on May 11. In the battle on May 11, 1779, in Charleston, South Carolina, Colonel Michael Kov√°ts lost his life in the war for American independence. He was buried where he fell. His British opponent in the battle, Brigade Major Skelly, paid Pulaski‚Äôs Legion the highest of compliments during the requiem, describing it as, \\"the best cavalry the rebels ever had.\\" Legacy A phrase from his letter to Franklin, \\"Most Faithful unto Death\\" (Fidelissimus ad Mortem) has since been taken as the motto of the American Hungarian Federation. On May 11, 1779, Colonel Kovats gave his life in the American War for Independence while leading the Continental Army cavalry he had trained in Hungarian hussar tactics against a British Siege of Charleston. To this date, Michael de Kovats is celebrated by cadets at The Citadel Military College in Charleston, South Carolina, where part of the campus is named in his honor. The Hungarian Embassy in Washington, D.C., has a statue sculpted by Paul Takacs and executed by Attila Dienes. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

She directed the films But I'm a Cheerleader, The Quiet and Itty Bitty Titty Committee. She has also directed episodes of television programs including Russian Doll, Gilmore Girls, Malcolm in the Middle, United States of Tara, Looking, Nip/Tuck, The L Word, Silicon Valley, and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Early life and education Babbit was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio. She grew up in Cleveland with her father, a lawyer and law school professor, and her mother who ran a treatment program for teenagers with drug and alcohol problems, before her death in 2006. The program was called New Directions, and it provided inspiration for the fictional \\"reparative therapy\\" (conversion therapy) camp \\"True Directions\\" in But I'm a Cheerleader. Babbit began acting at the Cleveland Play House at the age of seven, later moving into stage management and lighting. She studied West African Studies at Barnard College (graduating in 1993) and began taking film classes at New York University during her summer vacations. Career After graduating from Barnard College in 1993, Babbit's first job was as an assistant to the assistant for Martin Scorsese on The Age of Innocence. After that she worked as an intern on John Sayles's The Secret of Roan Inish where she worked with fellow aspiring filmmakers Karyn Kusama and Jasmine Kosovic. Babbit's next job was as script supervisor on John Duigan's film The Journey of August King-a job for which she had little experience, that she said she \\"lied her way into\\". This was followed by Su Friedrich's television film Hide and Seek. In 1996, after working on If These Walls Could Talk, where she met her future partner Andrea Sperling, Babbit got a job as script supervisor on David Fincher's film The Game. This proved to be influential to her career as a director. =Short films= In 1996, Babbit, with Ari Gold, directed Frog Crossing, a comedic short film about an animal rights activist who protects frogs as they hop across a highway. She followed this with 1999 comedy short Sleeping Beauties. While working on The Game, she discussed her idea for a short film based on a fairy tale with Fincher. He gave Babbit about 6,000 feet of 35 mm film. His editor gave her free use of an Avid editing machine. The star of The Game, Michael Douglas, wrote to Paramount and asked them to let Babbit access their costume department. As a result, she was able to make Sleeping Beauties for about $10,000. Based on the classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, the film is about a young woman (Sarah Lassez) who works as a makeup artist at a funeral home. Obsessed with an unavailable ex-girlfriend, she eventually meets and falls in love with a photographer's assistant (Clea DuVall). The short premiered at Sundance in 1995. Her other short film Stuck premiered at Sundance in 2002 and won a jury prize. =But I'm a Cheerleader= In 1999, Babbit directed her first feature film, But I'm a Cheerleader. Starring Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall, it is a romantic comedy about a high school cheerleader who is sent to a so-called \\"reparative therapy\\" camp when her parents suspect she is a lesbian. The film was inspired by an article that Babbit read about a man who had been sent to a similar camp. The camp in the film was partly based on a halfway house for young people with drug and alcohol problems run by her mother. Babbit appeared in This Film Is Not Yet Rated discussing this film and her struggle against an NC-17 rating.

He also received a Guggenheim Fellowship. After the spring 2007 semester he retired to emeritus status at the University of California Berkeley, where he received the Golden Apple Award for Outstanding Teaching that year.

He has taught at the University of Wisconsin, University of South Carolina, Louisiana State University and Colorado College. Litwack's interest in history was sparked by The Growth of the American Republic, by Samuel Eliot Morison and Henry Steele Commager (1930). Litwack said, \\"The textbook was my first confrontation with history. I asked my 11th grade teacher for the opportunity to respond to the textbook's version of Reconstruction, to what I thought were distortions and racial biases. (I had already read Howard Fast's Freedom Road.) The research led me to the library‚Äîand to W. E. B. Du Bois's Black Reconstruction, with that intriguing subtitle: An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860‚Äì1880.

In 1983-84, he was National Campaign Director for the successful Reagan-Bush 1984 campaign. Rollins is currently the chairman of the pro‚ÄìDonald Trump Great America PAC. Early life and education Rollins was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into an Irish Catholic blue-collar household. At the time, his father was stationed with the U.S. Army in the Aleutian Islands. After the war, his parents returned with him to Vallejo, California, where his father worked as an electrician at the city's Mare Island Navy Yard, primarily building submarines. Rollins grew up in the Federal Terrace housing project, attending St. Vincent Ferrer Grammar and High School. For a year, at age 14, he attended St. Joseph's, a junior seminary in Mountain View, before returning to Vallejo. He competed as a boxer from ages 13 to 23, winning several West Coast amateur titles. Rollins recalls his record as 164 victories and just 2 defeats.Rollins, Ed, with Tom DeFrank, Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics (New York: Broadway Books, 1996), p. 11, 26 Graduating from high school in 1961, he tried to enlist in the Marines, but failed the physical. Shortly thereafter, Rollins spent most of a year in the hospital dealing with his back problems. Once healthy, in 1962, he began undergraduate studies at Vallejo Junior College, eventually earned his associate degree, and transferred to San Jose State University in 1965. Unable to pass the physical exam required for a sports scholarship because of his continuing back problems, after one semester Rollins transferred to California State University, Chico, where he was hired as boxing coach. There he earned his BA in Political Science with a second major in Physical Education in 1968. Early political career Rollins interned in Sacramento for California's Democratic leader, Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh, in 1967. Unruh introduced Rollins to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy; in early 1968 he worked for Kennedy as a campus coordinator, then later for his primary campaign in Northern California. After the 1968 election and the GOP takeover of the California Assembly, he was hired by Republican Assemblyman Ray E. Johnson as his Chief of Staff, despite his prior service under the Democrats.http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/resource/findaid/rollins.htm In 1972, Rollins worked for the California campaign to re-elect President Richard Nixon. This gave Rollins his first close contact with Governor Ronald Reagan, who chaired Nixon's California campaign, and Lyn Nofziger, who ran the West Coast Nixon political operation.Ed Rollins on CNN, November 5, 2008 Rollins moved to Washington in 1973, to serve as principal assistant to Monagan overseeing congressional relations at the U.S. Department of Transportation. He continued as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs through the end of the Ford administration. From 1977 to 1979, he served as dean of the faculty and deputy superintendent at the National Fire Academy in Washington. During that time, he met and married Kitty Nellor Burnes. In early 1979, Rollins returned to Sacramento with his wife Kitty Nellor and became chief of staff for the Assembly Republican Caucus. During this period, he was offered but ultimately declined the position of chief of staff to former President Nixon. Reagan Administration, 1981-83 After the landslide GOP victory in November 1980, Rollins was hired to serve as Deputy Assistant to the President for Political Affairs under Nofziger. When Nofziger resigned in November 1981, Rollins was appointed as Assistant to the President for Political Affairs and Director of the Office of Political Affairs. A week before the 1982 election, on October 25, Rollins suffered two strokes, the result of a deteriorating neck artery that had been injured during his final boxing match in 1967. He recovered and returned to his White House job in December 1982, holding the position until resigning in October 1983 to lead Reagan's re-election campaign. University of Texas. In the second term, he rejoined the Reagan Administration for several months in 1985 as Assistant to the President for Political and Governmental Affairs. Political campaigns Rollins worked as National Campaign Director to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. Rollins was personally selected for the job by White House Chief of Staff James A. Baker III, who had served as Gerald Ford's manager in 1976. Rollins's deputy and Political Director was Lee Atwater. The Reagan-Bush ticket ultimately won 49 of the 50 states. After the election, Rollins agreed in January 1985 to return to the White House Office of Political Affairs, under new Chief of Staff Donald Regan. However, Rollins grew disenchanted after Regan passed him over for the post of Secretary of Labor following the resignation of Raymond Donovan, and with the abrasive chief's staff and style. On October 1, 1985, Rollins joined the Sacramento- based political consulting firm of Russo & Watts. In the 1988 Republican presidential primaries, Rollins managed the campaign of former New York Congressman Jack Kemp. In 1989, Rollins headed the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans' campaign wing. Leading Authorities Rollins got into a highly visible feud with President Bush over the 1990 budget deal, in which Bush broke his 1988 campaign promise not to raise taxes. Rollins wrote a memo to GOP candidates, telling them unequivocally, \\"Do not hesitate to distance yourself from the President.\\" He later wrote, \\"My job was electing Republicans to the House. George Bush and his tax deal made that impossible. Now my job was to see how many we could save ... Guys who didn't think they had a race were all of a sudden fighting for their lives, including Newt Gingrich.\\"Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, pp. 200-207 After resigning from the NRCC, Rollins began working as Washington managing partner for the Sawyer/Miller Group consulting firm. In June 1992, Rollins agreed to serve as co-manager (with Carter Democrat Hamilton Jordan) of Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign. He resigned in July. Later, he suggested that Perot was not emotionally suited to be President. Perot initially ended his campaign the day after Rollins resigned, only to resume his campaign after the Democratic National Convention. Rollins worked as the campaign manager for Christine Todd Whitman in her 1993 New Jersey gubernatorial race. After organizing a campaign that led to Whitman's come-from-behind victory, Rollins claimed to TIME magazine that he secretly paid black ministers and Democratic campaign workers in order to suppress voter turnout. \\"We went into black churches and we basically said to ministers who had endorsed Florio, 'Do you have a special project?' And they said, 'We've already endorsed Florio.' We said, 'That's fine, don't get up on the Sunday pulpit and preach. We know you've endorsed him, but don't get up there and say it's your moral obligation that you go on Tuesday to vote for Jim Florio.'\\" After public outcry and calls for an investigation, Rollins partially retracted some of these claims telling People magazine (March 31, 1997, Vol. 47, No. 12) that his comments were \\"an exaggeration that turned out to be inaccurate.\\" Rollins managed the campaign of George Nethercutt, who defeated Tom Foley in Washington State's eastern congressional district in November 1994.Edward Rollins - Leading Authorities Speakers Bureau That year, he was also general consultant to the Michael Huffington campaign for U.S. Senate in California, who lost to incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein, and also helped direct the Bruce D.

Khoury was running in the Republican primary against incumbent Representative Ken Calvert. In the 2002 campaign for Governor of California, Rollins consulted for then-Secretary of State Bill Jones, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination, losing to Bill Simon. Rollins was then hired by Simon for the fall gubernatorial campaign, which lost to incumbent Democrat Gray Davis. In 2006, Rollins consulted on the campaign of Republican New York State Senate contender Kathleen Troia \\"KT\\" McFarland. He also worked for the campaign of United States Representative Katherine Harris for the U.S. Senate from Florida. According to a Wall Street Journal article, the two had a falling-out, with Rollins not attending a staff meeting in Tampa and quitting a few days later after he questioned the viability of her campaign.The Wall Street Journal, May 10, 2006: \\"Katherine Harris Battles Old Friends For Florida's Keys\\" Rollins was the national campaign chairman on Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. Rollins was later overheard saying that he wanted to \\"knock out\\" Mitt Romney's teeth. Rollins signed on to plan the campaign of Michele Bachmann (R), U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 6th district. At the time of his appointment, Bachmann had not yet announced her candidacy but was expected to make her intentions known in June 2011.

Its main aim was to ensure the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child UNCRC. Welsh Regional Coordinator 1998 - 2000 was Millie Collins  About  The group, run by a steering committee, worked to ensure the rights of young people were heard by decision makers. It was founded after a young people's rights conference in Greenwich, London (England) and was run by and for young people aged 18 and under. The administrative duties of Article 12 were run by CRAE (Children's Rights Alliance for England). The group's most high-profile campaigns included 'Stop Smacking Us' (challenging Reasonable Chastisement) when it led a rally in Westminster to 10 Downing Street with 100 children. Its members have represented the United Kingdom at several United Nation's sessions. In 1999 Daisy Langmaid and David Joseph Henry took part in 10th commemorative meeting of the UNCRC in Geneva. In 2001 James Anderson and Lucy Mason took part in the Special Session on Children in New York. Many of its key members have gone on to become Human Rights activists. Article 12 also produced a report in 2000. It was called Respect and was \\"a report into how well Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is put into Practice across the UK\\". The team who produced this report called themselves CR2000, which stood for Children's Rights 20000. The report was put together by the members of CR2000 conducting interviews and research with children in schools, youth groups etc., gaining their opinions and views on how well their rights were upheld and how much their opinions were heard. Members of the team were : Anna Fisher, Daisy Langmaid, Emma Richardson, Francine Lansdown, Georgia Lansdown, Hossnieh Nayyeri, James Anderson, Laura Fisher, Lucy Mason, Michael Baker, Millie Collins, Robert O'Farrell, Tamsin Landells, This organisation is no longer active but its work continues through CRAE and work of former members who continue to work in the young people's rights movement.

Classical sources from the Greco-Roman era, in Greek and in hieroglyphics, give Rhacotis as an older name for Alexandria before the arrival of Alexander the Great. Rhacotis was located west of the now-silted Canopic branch of the Nile. Unlike ports within the Nile Delta, it was reliably accessible to large ships, and enough water for a city could be supplied by a canal. It is also described as the home of sentinels who protected the Egyptian kingdom from outsiders.  Etymology  The root of the name, qd, means \\"construct\\". The prefix r-Íú• can be used as a derivational morpheme forming nouns of action from infinitives, so a likely interpretation of the name as a whole is \\"building site\\" or \\"construction in progress\\".Mark Depauw, \\"Alexandria, the Building Yard\\"; Chronique d'√âgypte 75(149), pp. 64‚Äì65. doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.309126. Michel Chaveau of the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes argues that Rhakotis may simply have been the Egyptian name of the construction site for Alexandria; while John Baines contends that the style of the name and its linguistic context indicate that the name is older.John Baines, \\"Possible implications of the Egyptian word for Alexandria\\", Journal of Roman Archaeology, Vol. 16 (2003), pp. 61‚Äì63. (Appendix to Judith McKenzie, \\"Glimpsing Alexandria from archaeological evidence\\".)  Classical descriptions  The original city may have included the island of Pharos, a harbor mentioned in Homer's Odyssey as the kingdom of Proteus.Ahmed Abdel- Fattah, \\"The Question of the Presence of Pharaonic Antiquities in the City of Alexandria and its Neighboring Sites (Alexandria pre-Alexander the Great\\"; in Hawass (2003), pp. 63‚Äì73. Plutarch writes that this reference influenced Alexander in his decision to found a new capital at the harbor of Pharos.Plutarch, Life of Alexander, 26. \\"Accordingly, he rose up at once and went to Pharos, which at that time was still an island, a little above the Canobic mouth of the Nile, but now it has been joined to the mainland by a causeway. And when he saw a site of surpassing natural advantages (for it is a strip of land like enough to a broad isthmus extending between a great lagoon and a stretch of sea which terminates in a large harbour), he said he saw now that Homer was not only admirable in other ways, but also a very wise architect, and ordered the plan of the city to be drawn in conformity with this site.\\"Daniel Ogden, \\"Alexander and Africa (332‚Äì331 BC and beyond) : the facts, the traditions and the problems\\"; Acta Classica supplement 5, January 2014. The earliest text from Alexandria, a hieroglyphic \\"satrap\\" stela from the month of Thout in 311 BC, refers to R-qd as the preceding name of the city.Michel Chaveau, \\"Alexandrie et Rhak√¥tis: Le Point de Vue des √âgyptiens\\"; in Alexandrie : une m√©gapole cosmopolite (Proceedings of ninth colloquium at Villa K√©rylos, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, 2‚Äì3 October 1998); Cahiers de la Villa K√©rylos 9); Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, 1999.Ahmed Bey Kamal, Catalogue G√©n√©ral des Antiquit√©s √âgyptiennes du Mus√©e du Caire: Nos. 22001‚Äì22208: St√®les Prolemaiques et Romaines. Cairo: L'Institut Franƒáais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale, 1905; Cairo Museum #22182, p. 168. Strabo, in his description of Alexandria, describes Rhacotis as the home of Egyptian sentinels guarding the Nile.Strabo, Geographica, XVII.1.6. \\"The former kings of Egypt, satisfied with what they possessed, and not desirous of foreign commerce, entertained a dislike to all mariners, especially the Greeks (who, on account of the poverty of their own country, ravaged and coveted the property of other nations), and stationed a guard here, who had orders to keep off all persons who approached. To the guard was assigned as a place of residence the spot called Rhacotis, which is now a part of the city of Alexandreia, situated above the arsenal. At that time, however, it was a village. The country about the village was given up to herdsmen, who were also able (from their numbers) to prevent strangers from entering the country.\\" Pliny the Elder mentions Rhacotes as the former name of the site of Alexandria.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, V.11. \\"With the greatest justice, however, we may lavish our praises upon Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great on the shores of the Egyptian Sea, upon the soil of Africa, at twelve miles' distance from the Canopic Mouth and near Lake Mareotis25; the spot having previously borne the name of Rhacotes.\\" Alexandria was planned by Dinocrates, an experienced Greek architect and city planner from Rhodes, who modeled the new city after the Hellenistic architectural style popular in the Greek world at the time. The existing small village of Rhacotis, then a fishing port, became the Egyptian quarter of the city, located on the West side.Michael Sabottka, Kathrin Machinek, & Colin Clement, \\"Le Serapeum d'Alexandrie ‚Äì R√©sum√©\\"; Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie Orientale. Das Serapeum in Alexandria. Untersuchungen zur Architektur und Baugeschichte des Heiligtums von der fr√ºhen ptolem√§ischen Zeit biszur Zerst√∂rung. Etudes Alexandrines (15), pp.XI-XIII, 2008. Egyptians may have continued to refer to the whole city as Rhakotis, and in some cases resented its existence. Tacitus relates a story of the Egyptian priests that Ptolemy I, seeking a blessing for the construction of Alexandria, received instructions to obtain a certain statue from the temple of \\"infernal Jupiter\\" (Pluto) in Pontus (on the northern coast of modern Turkey, along the Black Sea). First they visit the oracle Pythia at Delphi, who confirms they are to remove the statue, but not its female companion (Proserpina). When they reach King Scydrothemis at Sinope, they find him reluctant to part with the statue. The god then leaves the temple of his own will and conveys the party back to Alexandria, where a new temple is established at Rhacotis‚Äîthe historical site of a temple to Serapis and Isis.Tacitus, Histories, 4.83‚Äì84. \\"A temple, proportioned to the grandeur of the city, was erected in a place called Rhacotis, where there had stood a chapel consecrated in old times to Serapis and Isis.\\" See also Plutarch, Moralia, \\"Isis and Osiris\\" ¬ß28.  Archaeology  Continuing maritime archaeology in the harbour of Alexandria has revealed details of Rhakotis before the arrival of Alexander. In 1916, while preparing construction of a new port, French engineer Gaston Jondet found a sophisticated ancient port facility west of Pharos. Kamal Abu el-Saadat continued research in the 1960s with a pioneering submarine archaeology campaign which found more ruins and a 25-ton statue fragment. Another campaign began in the 1990s under the supervision of Franck Goddio, finding numerous artifacts including twelve sphinxes, some apparently removed from Heliopolis by the Ptolemies.Victor V. Lebedinsky, \\"The Potential of Egyptian‚ÄìRussian Cooperation in Underwater Archaeology: An Historical Perspective\\"; in Hawass (2003), p. 289. Wood pilings and planks dated chemically and stratigraphically to c. 400 BC, and potsherds dated to 1000 BC, have been recovered from Alexandria's eastern harbor.Jean-Daniel Stanley, Thomas F. Jorstad, & Franck Goddio, \\"Human impact on sediment mass movement and submergence of ancient sites in the two harbours of Alexandria, Egypt\\"; Norwegian Journal of Geology 86(3), 2006.Jean-Daniel Stanley et al., \\"Alexandria, Egypt, before Alexander the Great: A multidisciplinary approach yields rich discoveries\\"; GSA Today 17 (8), August 2007; doi:10.1130/GSAT01708A.1. Recent chemical analysis of artifacts found in the harbor has discovered high levels of lead in the third millennium BC, peaking circa the turn of the 23rd century BC (Old Kingdom), and again near the turn of the first millennium BC (Nineteenth and Twentieth dynasties), as well as in the Hellenic era following the conquest of Alexander.A. V√©ron, J. P. Goiran, C. Morhange, N. Marriner, & J. Y. Empereur, \\"Pollutant lead reveals the pre-Hellenistic occupation and ancient growth of Alexandria, Egypt\\"; Geophysical Research Letters 33(6), 2006. They also suggest an expansive trade network including metal imports from Cyprus and Turkey.Alain J. V√©ron et al., \\"A 6000-year geochemical record of human activities from Alexandria (Egypt)\\"; Quaternary Science Reviews 81, 2013. Some or all of the remains of Rhacotis may lie beneath the densely populated modern city of Alexandria, and thus remain off limits to archaeologists. No attempts to date have discovered remains of an early city in the Alexandrine neighborhood with the same name.  Significance  The importance of Rhacotis remains a matter of debate. If the Rhacotis was indeed no more than a building yard, it may have been an inconsequential part of the Egyptian civilization before the arrival of Hellenic invaders.

Brief Overview The Chicana/o Latina/o Law Review is a student-run law journal which was established by the UCLA law school in 1972. At that time it was the first and only law journal in the United States to focus primarily on how law and policy affect the Chicana/o and Latina/o community within the country. Since then it has provided an essential forum for the discussion of central issues that Latinos in America face. This was a groundbreaking creation because popular law reviews at the time tended to overlook this vibrant and thriving community. Today, the Chicana/o Latina/o Law Review has a strong reputation for publishing reputable scholarly work on an array of topics, such as affirmative action and education, Spanish and Mexican land grants, environmental justice, language rights, and immigration reform. It has been cited as a persuasive authority in courtrooms across the country. =Editors- in-chief= *Volume 30 - Lisa Alarcon and Jeremy Avila *Volume 29 - Pablo Almazan and Joel Marrero *Volume 28 - Erica Grove and Jose Macias *Volume 27 - Fabian Renteria *Volume 26 - Yvonne Ballesteros and Johanna Sanchez *Volume 25 - Isabel Cesanto Safie and Caryn Mandelbaum =Current Board Members (2011-2012)= *Editor in Chief ‚Äì Laura Hernandez *Chief Executive Editor ‚Äì Esmeralda Meza *Chief Articles Editor ‚Äì Evonne Silva *Chief Managing Editor ‚Äì Tanya Franklin *Chief Productions Editor ‚Äì Christina Burrows Issues Addressed in the Law Review From the beginning of its publication, the most pervasive issue addressed in the Chicana/o Latina/o Law Review is the issue of immigration. Within this topic there have been numerous articles addressing immigration reform laws, immigration restrictions, the process of immigrating to the United States, and the troubles immigrants face once arriving in the United States. Throughout the nearly 40 years of the journal‚Äôs publication, the subject of immigration has come up repeatedly. Schooling is also a common topic of import in multiple articles throughout the CLLR‚Äôs publication. Under this heading have been articles on primary schooling, secondary education, the quality of public schools, affirmative action, and graduate and undergraduate schooling and opportunities for the Latino community in the United States. Many articles have focused on the role UCLA plays in the education and betterment of the Latino community. Throughout its publication, the law review has been self-evaluative, often looking at the UCLA community‚Äôs effect on Latino students. There have been many articles discussing the formation of the Latino identity within the United States, especially topics involving the importance of language. The issue of language, within schools and in the greater US society at large, is examined closely in many articles that have been published in CLLR throughout its history. Policies on language and language requirements have been examined and critiqued. Articles discussing language acquisition and how language restrictions affect the greater Latino community in the United States are also commonly found within the journal‚Äôs publication history. Other common topics and issues that have been covered in the Chicana/o Latina/o Law Review since its founding are naturalization, employment and undocumented labor, voting and the protection of other fundamental rights, criminal justice in regard to the Latino community, the political mobilization of the Latino community, and environmental justice. Role the Law Review has played for the larger Chicana/o and Latina/o communities Long before issues important to the Latina/o and Chicana/o communities, like immigration, language regulation, and bilingual education were being analyzed in mainstream law reviews, the Law Review wrote focused attention on these issues. By publishing articles on issues that impacted the Latino community in a law journal attached to UCLA Law School, the journal helped to bring these issues to the forefront of the academic community. The Law Review has given a voice to those who have been underrepresented in American society. It has helped to bring to light issues that impact the Chicano community that have been negated or forgotten by mainstream legal academia. Notable Alumni and Contributors Linda S√°nchez, who graduated from UCLA Law School in 1995, was editor of the Law Review. She is the U.S. Representative for California‚Äôs 39th congressional district Mich√®le Alexandre is an Associate Professor of Law at The University of Mississippi School of Law. She did not graduate from UCLA Law School, but has published law review articles in the UCLA Chicano/a-Latino/a Law Review Kevin R. Johnson is the Dean and Mabie-Apallas Professor of Public Interest Law and Chicana/o Studies at UC Davis School of Law. Although not a graduate of UCLA Law School, has contributed to the law review. His most recent article is An Essay on the Nomination and Confirmation of the First Latina Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor: The Assimilation Demand at Work Gerald P. Lopez, a current professor of Law at UCLA Law School, has written articles for the law review. He is the founder of the Center for Community Problem Solving at New York University School of Law.

He was a transport entrepreneur who developed the modern intermodal shipping container, which revolutionized transport and international trade in the second half of the twentieth century. Containerization led to a significant reduction in the cost of freight transportation by eliminating the need for repeated handling of individual pieces of cargo, and also improved reliability, reduced cargo theft, and cut inventory costs by shortening transit time. Early life McLean was born in Maxton, North Carolina in 1913. His first name was originally spelled Malcolm, though he used Malcom later in life. In 1935, when he finished high school at Winston-Salem, his family did not have enough money to send him to college, but there was enough for Malcolm to buy a used truck. The same year, McLean, his sister, Clara McLean, and his brother, Jim McLean, founded McLean Trucking Co. Based out of Red Springs, North Carolina, McLean Trucking started out hauling empty tobacco barrels, with Malcolm as one of the drivers.Cudahy, Brian J., - \\"The Containership Revolution: Malcolm McLean's 1956 Innovation Goes Global\\" TR News. - (c/o National Academy of Sciences). - Number 246. - September‚ÄìOctober 2006. - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document) Containerization The idea of transporting trucks on ships was put into practice before World War II. In 1926 regular connection of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or, by Southern Railway and French Northern Railway began. For transport of passengers' baggage, four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat cars in the UK and ‚ÄúCIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL‚Äù in France. In the early 1950s, McLean decided to attempt use of the containers commercially. By 1952, he was developing plans to carry his company's trucks on ships along the U.S. Atlantic coast, from North Carolina to New York. It soon became apparent that \\"trailerships\\", as they were called, would be inefficient because of the large waste in potential cargo space on board the vessel, known as broken stowage. The original concept was modified into loading just the containers, not the chassis, onto the ships, hence the designation container ship or \\"box\\" ship. At the time, U.S. regulations would not allow a trucking company to own a shipping line. McLean secured a bank loan for $22 million and in January 1956 bought two World War II T-2 tankers, which he converted to carry containers on and under deck. McLean oversaw the construction of wooden shelter decks, known as Mechano decking. This was a common practice in World War II for the carriage of oversized cargo, such as aircraft. It took several months to refit the ships, construct containers to carry on and below the vessels' decks and design trailer chassis to allow removable containers. On April 26, 1956, with 100 invited dignitaries on hand, one of the converted tankers, the SS Ideal-X (informally dubbed the \\"SS Maxton\\" after McLean's hometown in North Carolina), was loaded and sailed from the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, New Jersey, for the Port of Houston, Texas, carrying fifty-eight Trailer Vans later called containers, along with a regular load of liquid tank cargo. As the Ideal-X left the Port of Newark, Freddy Fields, a top official of the International Longshoremen's Association, was asked what he thought of the newly fitted container ship. Fields replied, \\"I'd like to sink that son of a bitch.\\" McLean flew to Houston to be on hand when the ship safely docked. In 1956, most cargoes were loaded and unloaded by hand by longshoremen. Hand-loading a ship cost $5.86 a ton at that time. Using containers, it cost only 16 cents a ton to load a ship, 36-fold savings. Containerization also greatly reduced the time to load and unload ships. McLean knew \\"A ship earns money only when she's at sea\\", and based his business on that efficiency. In April 1957, the first container ship, the Gateway City, began regular service between New York, Florida, and Texas. During the summer of 1958 McLean Industries, still using the name Pan- Atlantic Steamship Corporation, inaugurated container service between the U.S. and San Juan, Puerto Rico with the vessel Fairland. The name was officially changed from Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation to Sea-Land Service, Inc. in April 1960. McLean's operation was profitable by 1961 and he kept adding routes and buying bigger ships. In August 1963, McLean opened a new port facility in Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, to handle even more container traffic. The development of the container market was slow until the late 1960s. Many ports did not have the cranes to lift containers on and off ships, and change was slow to come to an industry steeped in tradition. Moreover, unions resisted an idea that threatened their very livelihood. In April 1966, Sea-Land commenced service between New York and Rotterdam, Bremen and Grangemouth (Scotland). The following year (1967), they were invited by the U.S. Government to start a container service to South Vietnam. The service to Vietnam produced 40% of the company's revenue in 1968/69.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08jbd20 In late 1968, commercial container ship service was inaugurated from the Far East to the United States. This service was expanded to Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1969, and to Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines in 1971. To achieve reductions in labor and dock servicing time, McLean followed Roy Fruehauf's lead and became vigilant about standardization. His efforts to increase efficiency resulted in standardized container designs that were awarded patent protection. \\\\- (Apparatus for shipping freight) McLean made his patents available by issuing a royalty-free lease to the International Organization for Standardization. By the end of the 1960s, Sea-Land Industries had 27,000 trailer-type containers, manufactured by Fruehauf, 36 trailer ships and access to over 30 port cities. As the advantages to McLean's container system became apparent, competitors quickly adapted. They built bigger ships, larger gantry cranes and more sophisticated containers. Sea-Land needed cash to stay competitive. McLean turned to Reynolds Tobacco Company, a company he knew from his trucking company days when his trucks transported Reynolds cigarettes across the United States. In January 1969, Reynolds agreed to buy Sea-Land for $530 million in cash and stock. McLean made $160 million personally,Hanseatic Lloyd‚ÄîNews and got a seat on the company's board. To carry out the purchase, Reynolds formed a holding company, named R.J. Reynolds Industries, Inc., which bought Sea-Land in May 1969. That same year, Sea-Land ordered five of the largest, fastest container ships in the world - SL-7 class vessels. They had come a long way since the inaugural sailing of the Pan-Atlantic \\"Ideal-X\\" in 1956. Under Reynolds, Sea- Land's profits were intermittent. By the end of 1974, Reynolds had put more than $1 billion into Sea-Land, building huge terminals in New Jersey and Hong Kong and adding to its fleet of container ships. Sea-Land's biggest expense was fuel, so in 1970, RJR bought the American Independent Oil Co., better known as Aminoil, for $56 million. RJR put millions into oil exploration, trying to get Aminoil large enough to compete in the world exploration market. In 1974, R.J. Reynolds Industries had its best year. Sea-Land's earnings increased nearly 10 times, to $145 million. Aminoil's earnings soared to $86.3 million. Dun & Bradstreet, the financial-ratings firm, named RJR one of its five best-managed companies in America. But in 1975, Sea-Land's earnings dropped sharply, along with Aminoil's. McLean gave up his Reynolds board seat in 1977 and cut ties with the company. In June 1984, R.J. Reynolds Industries, Inc. spun off Sea-Land Corporation to shareholders, as an independent, publicly held company, with stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Sea- Land achieved the highest revenues and earnings in its 28-year history. In September 1986, Sea-Land Corporation merged with CSA Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of CSX Corporation. Sea-Land Corporation common stock was exchanged for $28 per share, cash. Sea-Land's international services were sold to Maersk in 1999, and the combined company was named Maersk Sealand, which, in 2006, became known simply as Maersk Line. The former Sea-Land's domestic services now operate as Horizon Lines, which accounts for approximately 36% of the total U.S. marine container shipments between the continental U.S. and the markets of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and to Guam. The company is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Subsequent business ventures In 1968 McLean financed a real estate project in Waveland, Mississippi, that has become Diamondhead. In 1978, McLean purchased United States Lines. There, he built a fleet of 4,400-TEU container ships that were the largest afloat at the time. The ships, operating in round-the-world service, were designed in the aftermath of the 1970s oil shortages and were fuel-efficient but slow, and therefore not well-adapted to compete in the subsequent period of cheap oil. USL went bankrupt in 1987. McLean took very personally the criticism directed against him after the collapse of USL and the resulting loss of many jobs associated with and dependent on USL. In 1982, McLean made the Forbes 400 Richest Americans list with a net worth of $400 million, however, a few years later, having gambled on rising oil prices that failed to materialize, McLean had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy owing debt of $1.3 billion. In 1991, at 78, McLean founded Trailer Bridge, Inc., which operates between the US mainland (Jacksonville, Florida), Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. McLean also developed non-maritime inventions, including a means of lifting a patient from a stretcher onto a hospital bed. Death McLean died at his home on the East Side of Manhattan on May 25, 2001, age 87, of heart failure. His death prompted Norman Y. Mineta to make the following statement: In an editorial shortly after his death, Baltimore Sun stated that \\"he ranks next to Robert Fulton as the greatest revolutionary in the history of maritime trade.\\"\\"Shipping Pioneer Largely Ignored\\". - The Baltimore Sun. - June 14, 2001. p.23A. Forbes Magazine called McLean \\"one of the few men who changed the world.\\" On the morning of McLean's funeral, container ships around the world blew their whistles in his honor. Honors Fortune inducted McLean into its Business Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1995, American Heritage named him one of the ten outstanding innovators of the past 40 years. In 2000, he was named Man of the Century by the International Maritime Hall of Fame. McLean was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1982. In 2000, McLean received an honorary degree from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. McLean is the only person to found three companies that were later listed on the New York Stock Exchange (plus two others on the NASDAQ). Trailer Bridge, Inc., which McLean founded in 1992, annually awards the Malcolm P. McLean Innovative Spirit Award. The annual McLean Award recognizes an outstanding graduating student at George Mason University, selected by professors. McLean was inducted into the North Carolina Transportation Hall of Fame in 2006. Notes and references ; Footnotes ; References *Marc Levinson.

With a membership of 400,000 including retirees, its stated mission is to achieve quality healthcare, good jobs and social justice for all. It is the largest local union within the Service Employees International Union. History Local 1199 was founded in 1932 as a local of the Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union by Leon J. Davis to organize pharmacists in New York City. The local also included pharmacists, pharmacy clerks and \\"soda jerks\\". The union led pioneering pickets and strikes against racial segregation and racially discriminatory hiring in Harlem and elsewhere in New York City during the 1930s. The House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Local 1199's leadership in 1948 for Communist \\"infiltration\\". 1199 was a tiny local at the time, however, and during the expulsions of large left-led unions from the CIO in the 1940s, 1199 eventually found shelter under the auspices of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Local 1199 first successfully organized nonprofessional hospital workers in 1958, mobilizing a heavily Black and Puerto Rican workforce in the first flush of the postwar Civil Rights Movement. On 8 May 1959 about 3500 hospital workers began a strike against seven large private hospitals in New York City that lasted forty-six days. This unprecedented action ended when both sides agreed that labor relations in the hospitals would be supervised by a quasi-public agency, the Permanent Administrative Committee. The committee was successfully challenged in 1962. The local began organizing professional and technical workers in 1963, and in the same year won the right to collective bargaining under provisions of the state's labor relations act. In 1965, began representing workers throughout New York State, won a contract in 1968 that for the first time secured a minimum salary for workers of $100 a week, and in 1973 began to organize registered nurses. The union's first campaign outside of New York City was the formation of District 1199B in Columbia, South Carolina in 1969. The union led a strike there that never led to a contract, but had success in creating new 1199 districts in Upstate New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, elsewhere in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, and elsewhere. Serious faction fights broke out within the flagship New York local and among other 1199 locals after the retirement of the union's original leadership. An initial attempt by the national union to merge with SEIU in the early 1980s prompted the local to leave the RWDS to form a short-lived National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees during the 1980s, but its constituent locals soon thereafter sought mergers with other unions. Most locals eventually merged with SEIU, but 1199C in Philadelphia, under the leadership of Henry Nicholas, merged with AFSCME. Internal disputes persisted until 1989, when Dennis Rivera became its president. Rivera oversaw the local's 1998 incorporation into SEIU and a tremendous growth in membership as it integrated smaller SEIU chapters and conducted new organizing drives. Influence Thomas Menino, then-Mayor of Boston, at an 1199SEIU event in 2007 Martin Luther King, Jr. famously described 1199 as \\"my favorite union,\\" and the \\"authentic conscience of the labor movement.\\" His widow Coretta Scott King became the honorary chairman of 1199's organizing campaigns as it sought to expand outside of New York City beginning the late 1960s. 1199SEIU today represents 400,000 registered nurses, techs, aides and other healthcare workers in hospitals, nursing homes, homecare programs, clinics and pharmacies throughout New York State, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Maryland and Washington, D.C. More recently, Patrick Gaspard, a former executive vice president for politics and legislation at the union, was the political director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Gaspard was appointed White House Political Director during Obama's first term in office. In addition to collective bargaining for its 400,000 members along the East Coast, 1199 utilizes its substantial budget to lobby and make political endorsements across party lines. Milly Silva, current executive vice president of 1199SEIU, was the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of New Jersey in the 2013 election. In the winter and spring of 2016, 1199SEIU's president George Gresham was appointed chair of the Mario Cuomo Campaign for Economic Justice, which was the leading force behind the successful passage of the $15 minimum wage in New York State.

The film features 30 songs from segments of four concerts of the tour: New York, on 25 May (four songs); Seattle, Washington, 10 June (five songs); and Los Angeles, California, 22 June (fifteen songs) and 23 June (six songs). Both the cover of the home video release and McCartney himself in his intro to The McCartney Years DVD acknowledge only the Seattle concert, however. These concerts were part of the 1975‚Äì76 Wings Over the World tour, which also produced the triple live album Wings over America (1976) and the Wings Over the World television documentary (1979). This is also the first film released by Miramax. Production The music for what was to become Rockshow and part of Wings Over the World was produced by Chris Thomas and engineered by Phil McDonald during 1979. However, the processing of the Rockshow overdubs was obviously completed by the airdate of Wings Over the World, as these same performances were featured in both productions. Not all of the songs made it to the film in their entirety (\\"Medicine Jar\\" and \\"Letting Go\\" have been edited), and the song introductions did not always match the performance which followed. For example, several of the introductions came from the Seattle performance while the actual song was taken from a Los Angeles show: \\"Magneto & Titanium Man\\", \\"Spirits of Ancient Egypt\\", \\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"Let 'Em In\\", and \\"Soily\\". The introduction of the horn section was a composite as well with portions coming from Seattle and the final Los Angeles show. Release The film premiered on 26 November 1980 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York; McCartney did not attend, as he was in the studio at the time. They did attend the London Premiere at the Dominion Theatre in Piccadilly Circus on 8 April 1981. The film was later edited down to 102 minutes for its home video release. Its first home video release was on Betamax in October 1981, with a VHS, laserdisc, and CED release in 1982. This would be the last time a feature-length version of the film would be available to the general public until 31 years later, as McCartney had remained reluctant to make the entire film available to the general public on VHS or DVD. In 2007, a shortened cut with only seven songs was released as part of The McCartney Years DVD set ‚Äì one of which, a version of the Beatles' \\"Lady Madonna\\", was originally left out of the Rockshow home video release. =2013 re-release= In June 2013, a new restored version of the film was released. The longer 125-minute version was digitally restored from the 35mm negative with the soundtrack remixed in 5.1 surround sound. The film had a limited worldwide cinema re-release on 16 May 2013, with an exclusive introduction and interview with McCartney. An exclusive VIP premiere screening, with McCartney in attendance and introducing the film, took place at BAFTA on 15 May. This restored cut was released on DVD and Blu-ray in June 2013.

He also became a best-selling author and the producer of swimming videos that drew millions of views.  Birth and Education  Laughlin (pronounced LOCK-lin) was born March 25, 1951 in Brooklyn, New York to electrician John Laughlin and the former Patricia O‚ÄôToole, who worked in a doctor's office. The oldest of six children, he grew up on Long Island, in Williston Park. He graduated from a Roman Catholic high school and then St. John's University in Queens. He majored in political science and graduated in 1972.  Student Swimmer  His swimming abilities as a young student growing up on Long Island were not impressive. He was cut from his grammar school swim team, but still aspired to race competitively. After swimming two summers in pursuit of his Red Cross 50-Mile swim badge, he landed a spot in his high school swim team. \\"At age 13, I discovered I really enjoyed the solitude of doing laps,\\" Laughlin told author Tim Ferriss. \\"Just through doing the laps to earn my 50-Mile badge, I turned myself into an OK swimmer, certainly not one with any sort of efficient technique, but one who could swim a mile a day.\\" \\"After a modest high school swimming career in which he never qualified for the New York City Catholic High School Athletics Association championships and swimming four years at St. John‚Äôs University without winning any major honors, Laughlin accepted a job coaching at USMMA in 1972,\\" wrote Bob Herzog in Newsday.  Coach and Founder  Laughlin started coaching in the early 1970s at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York. His coaching of college and club teams produced 24 national champions. He then founded the Total Immersion swim program in 1989 to work with what he termed ‚Äúadult-onset swimmers,‚Äù who took up the sport in adulthood, often as triathletes with little swimming experience. His teaching emphasized efficiency in the water through balance, streamlining, drag reduction and energy conservation. He targeted Masters swimmers and triathletes, stressing the benefits of finishing the swimming leg of competition with a low heart rate. Many coaches of age group, collegiate and elite swimmers adopted his approach. ‚ÄúHis teaching methods opened up a whole new world to runners and cyclists who wanted to become triathletes,‚Äù said Ann Svenson, registrar for the Adirondack Masters.  Author and Producer  Laughlin's first book ‚ÄúTotal Immersion: The Revolutionary Way to Swim Better, Faster and Easier‚Äù, was published in 1996 by Simon & Schuster, and has sold more than 275,000 copies as an e-book and trade paperback. Trainer Christopher Drozd described the book as \\"gold\\" in a review at SportFit.com, \\"Just as there is more to weightlifting than pushing some iron from point A to point B, swimming is a subtle and complex endeavor. A potentially dry (no pun intended) subject ‚Äì learning to swim ‚Äì becomes an entertaining journey through hydrodynamics and physics. Laughlin also authored \\"Extraordinary Swimming For Every Body - a Total Immersion instructional\\", \\"Triathlon Swimming Made Easy: The Total Immersion Way for Anyone to Master Open-Water Swimming\\", \\"Swimming Made Easy: The Total Immersion Way for Any Swimmer to Achieve Fluency, Ease, and Speed in Any Stroke\\" and \\"Swimming Made Easy\\". He also produced numerous instructional videos, swimming in many of them. His most popular video \\"Total Immersion Freestyle Swimming Demonstration\\" has accumulated more than 2.2 million YouTube views. \\"He was on a mission to change how swimming was taught all over the globe ‚Äì the business was a byproduct of that passion. Terry stood tall in stature and influence, and to some he appeared larger than life. But those who knew him well were struck by his child-like curiosity about the world, and the optimism with which he confronted life‚Äôs challenges and rewards,\\" wrote Laughlin's friend and business associate Keith Woodburn.  Death  Before prostate cancer claimed him at age 66, Laughlin was swimming better than he had ever done before, winning championships and setting records. According to his blog, he completed a Corsica-to-Sardinia swim of nearly ten miles in four hours, 31 minutes, with two friends in 2015. ‚ÄúAfter living with metastatic prostate cancer for two years (about which he blogged widely), Terry passed away on Friday, October 20th, 2017, of complications related to his condition. He displayed his characteristic optimism, wit, and passion for life‚Äîand swimming‚Äîuntil the very end,\\" wrote his wife Alice and daughters Fiona, Carrie and Betsy, in a news release carried by Slow Twitch.com. Following his death The Economist wrote that Terry Laughlin's Total Immersion \\"has become a bestselling book, a much-watched series of videos, a coaching business and a catchphrase among hydrophiles the world over. It turned even the most timid novices into smooth, confident strokemakers, and honed the technique of champions.\\"  Legacy  Laughlin's Total Immersion clinics taught thousands of swimmers and certified hundreds of instructors to run their own clinics, spreading the discipline globally. His wife, Alice, who founded Total Immersion with him said there are more than 350 certified Total Immersion instructors operating in more than 30 countries as of 2017. His lifelong passion for swimming involved multiple roles‚Äîstudent, athlete, coach, teacher, technician, author and producer‚Äîwhile his career took him all over the world, from Hawaii to Thailand to the Caribbean. Although he trained national-level swimmers as well as top-ranked triathletes, Laughlin found much satisfaction in teaching people who were afraid of water ‚Äî who were 20, 30, 40, even 90 years old, who had never learned to swim. While he improved swimming for thousands, Laughlin also paused to focus the individual. \\"He never dismissed an honest inquiry with a curt response and would spend hours each day returning emails,\\" wrote his longtime Master's Swimming lane mate David Barra. \\"Terry always sought new ways to quantify and communicate the relationship between effort and efficiency in terms accessible to the novice and expert alike. He did so with a contagious enthusiasm.\\" Further reading  *  References   External links  * http://www.totalimmersion.net/ * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2TSkgdy7jI Category:American swimming coaches Category:People from Williston Park, New York Category:St. John's University (New York City) alumni Category:1951 births Category:2017 deaths ","title":"Terry Laughlin"},{"id":"4854950","text":"Thomas J. Fararo Thomas J. Fararo (February 11, 1933 - August 20, 2020) was Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh. After earning a Ph.D. in sociology at Syracuse University in 1963, he received a three-year postdoctoral fellowship for studies in pure and applied mathematics at Stanford University (1964‚Äì1967). In 1967, he joined the faculty of University of Pittsburgh; during 1972-1973, he was visiting professor at the University of York in England. Fararo is listed in American Men and Women of Science, Who's Who in America, and Who's Who in Frontier Science and Technology. In 1998, he received the Distinguished Career Award from the Mathematical Sociology section of the American Sociological Association. In addition to over a dozen books, Fararo has published over two dozen book chapters, over one dozen articles in reference works, and over 50 journal articles. Some of his books are edited works that relate to his career-long interest in making mathematical ideas relevant to the development of sociological theory. Fararo has served on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Sociology, the American Sociological Review, the Journal of Mathematical Sociology, Social Networks, Sociological Forum, and Sociological Theory. Fararo has been both an originator and an explicator of ideas and methods relating to the use of formal methods in sociological theory. In his original work, he has employed theories and methods relating to social networks in combination with a focus on social processes. This combination is illustrated by the theoretical method he has called E-state Structuralism (where E stands for Expectations) with work on this done with former student John Skvoretz. He often employs the axiomatic method in such work, as in the 2003 monograph with his student Kenji Kosaka that sets out a formal theory of how images of stratification are generated. In his expository work, he has attempted to move the field of sociology closer to a conception of theorizing that is more formal, as in his 1973 book Mathematical Sociology and in various papers and edited books, including the 1984 volume Mathematical Ideas and Sociological Theory. One of his objectives has been to articulate a coherent vision of the core of sociological theory: its philosophy, its key theoretical problems, and its methods, especially those employing formal representation. This objective is represented in his 1989 book, The Meaning of General Theoretical Sociology: Tradition and Formalization. The general vision that informs Fararo's theoretical work is \\"the spirit of unification,\\" a theme that is set out in Social Action Systems: Foundation and Synthesis in Sociological Theory, a 2001 book that analyzes key theories from the standpoint of the aspiration of synthesis, moving toward more comprehensive theories of social life.

In 2020, it had 97,000 members, down from nearly 150,000 in 2013. UHW is headquartered in Oakland, California and has offices statewide. UHW is an industrial union representing all classifications of health care workers in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, home health agencies as well as homecare workers. History UHW was created by the merger of two SEIU local unions: Local 250 in Northern California and Local 399 in Southern California. The larger of those two locals, Local 250, began when workers at San Francisco General Hospital, who were inspired by the 1934 general strike in San Francisco, organized a union at their hospital in 1934 as the Hospital and Institutional Workers Union #19818, later affiliating with the Building Service Employees International Union, becoming BSEIU Local 250. After affiliation, they won a groundbreaking first contract with the San Francisco Hospital Conference, covering 11 hospitals. BSEIU Local 399 emerged in 1949, when several Southern California local unions consolidated under the leadership of BSEIU's Charles \\"Pop\\" Hardy who had a vision of joining small unions together to build strength. It then successfully negotiated a contract with the first Kaiser Permanente hospital, in Los Angeles, the following year. In 1958, both BSEIU Local 250 and Local 399 joined together in leading the BSEIU effort to defeat Prop. 18, a right-to-work initiative. After BSEIU changed its name to SEIU in 1968, the two locals partnered again in 1974 to successfully lobby Congress to change federal law, allowing non-profit hospitals to organize. The two merged to form SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU Local 2005) in 2004. On January 27, 2009, SEIU placed UHW West under trusteeship and dismissed 70 of the local's executives, including president Sal Rosselli.\\"SEIU Takes Over West Coast Union\\", San Francisco Chronicle (January 28, 2009)Steven T. Jones, \\"Union Showdown\\", San Francisco Bay Guardian (January 28, 2009) Rosselli and other ousted leaders reformed under the National Union of Healthcare Workers and pushed for UHW West members at 60 facilities to vote to decertify SEIU.George Raine, \\"Ousted SEIU Leaders Push Decertification Vote\\", San Francisco Chronicle (February 3, 2009) In the series of elections that have taken place so far to determine whether or not current SEIU-UHW members want to stay in their union or join rival NUHW, more than 73,000 have chosen to stay in the local.\\"Workers in Four Healthcare Facilities Choose to Stay in SEIU-UHW, Reject Rival Union\\", BusinessWire (July 30, 2010) On June 23, 2010 SEIU-UHW members at Kaiser Permanente ratified a contract covering 46,000 California workers guaranteeing a 3% annual wage increases.\\"Kaiser workers OK two-year labor contract\\", Kathy Robertson, Sacramento Business Journal (June 25, 2010) Other recent victories of the union include winning a six-week strike against Sutter Health in San Francisco; the conclusion of successful negotiations with Catholic Healthcare West; organizing victories at O'Connor Woods Retirement Community in Stockton, California (later decertified two years later which was a stunning defeat for SEIU-UHW), St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, Parkview Community Hospital in Riverside, California, and of IT workers at Kaiser; and a statewide contract victory with HCA, the nation's largest hospital company. Most of the union's current organizing work is being carried out in Southern California. On March 26, 2020, amid concerns about a shortage of protective equipment for healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic, SEIU-UHW announced it had secured a stockpile of 39 million N95 masks, for purchase by various hospital systems and government agencies. (The union later clarified that it had no financial interest in arranging these transactions.) Hospitals that did not place orders became the target of SEIU petitions accusing them of \\"putting bottom line profits over [healthcare workers' and patients'] safety.\\" On April 11, it was revealed that SEIU-UHW and other middlemen had been the victims of a scam and that the stockpile did not exist. The scheme was uncovered by FBI agents during attempts to seize the shipment for FEMA under the Defense Production Act.

The highway extends northwest from (US 195) in Steptoe through Sprague to an intersection with in Harrington. It serves as a route from and in Sprague towards Pullman via US 195, and has a longer child route, that travels north from SR 23 near Sprague to Reardan and Chewelah. SR 23 was formally established in 1964 using roadways that have existed since 1937 as Secondary State Highway 11F (SSF 11C) from Sprague to Harrington and Secondary State Highway 11C (SSH 11C) from Steptoe to Sprague. SSH 11C was removed from Steptoe to Ewan in 1943 and became an extension of Primary State Highway 18 (PSH 18) and was completely designated as PSH 18 in 1953 and removed from the highway system in 1961. A second child route, , is proposed to be built from Ritzville to Ewan, but has not been built. Route description Steptoe, the southern terminus of SR 23 State Route 23 (SR 23) originates as Cashup Avenue at an intersection with (US 195) in Steptoe, about north of Colfax. The road has 2 undivided lanes as it travels west through mostly rural areas and becomes Front Street in Saint John. Leaving the town, the highway turns northwest following Pleasant Valley Creek, intersecting the proposed terminus of in Ewan and a road serving Lamont, passing several lakes, and leaving Whitman County. After entering Lincoln County, the highway crosses over Union Pacific and BNSF rail lines, then passes through Sprague. The highway serves as exit 245 on (I-90) and in a diamond interchange, and is the busiest point on the route with an annual average daily traffic of 1,300 vehicles in 2011. North of the interchange, splits off and travels north towards Reardan, being longer than SR 23.

The road crosses a BNSF rail line and turns north, becoming 3rd Street until the route ends at . History SR-23 was formally established in 1964, but the roadway has existed as early as 1926. The road was officially added to the state highway system as two highways in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 11C (SSH 11C) from Steptoe to Sprague and Secondary State Highway 11F (SSF 11C) from Sprague to Harrington. SSH 11C was shortened in 1943 to a Ewan-Sprague route and the former section to Steptoe became part of an extension of Primary State Highway 18 (PSH 18). SSH 11C was completely removed from the system in 1951, and it took effect in 1961 as the number was reused elsewhere.

After studying philosophy and psychology at the University of Paris-Sorbonne, he graduated with a dissertation on \\"hierarchical representations in the history of philosophy\\". He currently teaches at various elite engineering colleges. Most of Rosenbaum's multidisciplinary works are meant to put modes of comparison into historical perspective. The sacred order (L'ordre sacr√©) questions the importance of hierarchical images (levels of thought, strata of Being, scales of virtue,...) in the history of western philosophy. Stressing the importance of platonic traditions, Rosenbaum argues that stratification is the prevailing mode of comparison in antique and medieval philosophy. He acknowledges the decline of hierarchical images during the European Renaissance, but contends that this decline is misleading, as hierarchical representations have been surviving in more discreet ways ever since. The fear of inferiority (La peur de l'inf√©riorit√©) investigates the historical changes in procedures of social comparison, highlighting the peculiarities of the contemporary system of \\"overcomparison\\". The influence of Alfred Adler's thought on this work is undeniable. Through the expectation of personal success, the intensification of envy and the invasion of measures, it is argued, subjects of nonhierarchical societies are constantly comparing to each other and \\"prone to feelings of inferiority\\". In Antisemitism, Rosenbaum tries to show how this permanent and ubiquitous social jealousy frames the modern forms of antisemitism. In Vivid memories, lastly, the question of the collective components of pride or humiliation is tackled. Drawing on social comparison theory, Rosenbaum maintains that History of one's group is a major resource for individuals seeking to gain or regain self-esteem. The emergence of competing memories in multicultural countries like France or the U.S. is then traced back to social comparison processes.  Bibliography  * 2007: Vivid memories. [M√©moires vives.

It outgrows the blennies, its relatives, and may reach a length of TL A low spiny dorsal fin stands along the entire back. This includes about 70 spines and unites with the caudal and anal fins. Small eyes lie near the top of its big head. The mouth slants sharply above a ponderous lower jaw. Along its reddish brown upper sides extend several irregular rows of small dark spots. The dorsal and anal fins also show spots. The lack of ventral fins and a pronounced upward pointing mouth are characteristic. Distribution and habitat Dwelling along the North Atlantic coast of North America, it ordinarily hugs the bottom from shallow water down to a depth of around . It creates burrows in the mud bottom on which it lives. About 2 inches around and 1.5 to 3 in below the surface, the burrow branches into tunnels. Sometimes, however, the burrow stands as high as 4 feet above the low water mark. It begins in a centrally placed mound with smaller openings along the tunnel and at its end. At night, they may be seen protruding about a head's length from their burrows, but are seldom seen out in the open. In thousands of hours of night diving in their habitat, we only observed one out of its burrow once, and when disturbed it returned immediately to the nearest opening. It spawns in the winter, probably in deep water. Little is known about their food, but it seems likely that they feed mainly on amphipods, polychaete worms and the occasional small fish. Wrymouth in its burrow Reproduction Almost nothing is known about their reproductive biology. Small, but well developed fry have been recorded from the northern parts of their range in Howe Sound in early spring, suggesting that spawning may take place in winter. Eggs and early fry are completely unknown, suggesting the possibility that spawning may take place inside the burrow system.

In Spain Don Luis Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n was the ninth conde de Alba de Liste. He was a lieutenant and police officer in Zamora and mayor of Sacas. He also held other posts in government service, and was made a Knight Commander in the Order of Calatrava. In New Spain He was named viceroy of New Spain on May 28, 1648, under King Philip IV of Spain. He arrived in Chapultepec, near Mexico City, on June 27, 1650, and the following day received his office from the Audiencia. Nevertheless, his actual government didn't begin until July 3, when he made his official entrance into Mexico City. His main accomplishment as viceroy was to reform the colony's treasury. He took the collection of tributes and sales taxes from the royal officials and established instead two tribunals to oversee the taxes. This resulted in a considerable increase in revenue, most of which was sent to Spain to relieve the dire financial straits of Philip IV. Other events during his tenure included the following. A heated dispute broke out between Don Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, bishop of Puebla and the Audiencia over whether the bishop could display an emblem of his office publicly on the facade of the cathedral in Puebla. A large fire broke out in the Palace of Cort√©s. And the legendary Monja Alf√©rez died in Veracruz. The Tarahumara Indians had been in revolt in the mountains of Chihuahua for several years. They had killed several Franciscan friars, one Jesuit, and some soldiers. They had sacked and leveled some Spanish villages. The viceroy ordered the governor of Durango to establish a presidio at Papig√≥chic, and he sent troops there to deal with the insurrection. However, the rebels destroyed the fort and continued their pillaging. The Spaniards eventually caught the leader of the rebel, Teporaca. He was hung from a tree. He died \\"spouting curses against the Spanish and against the cowards in his own force, who had surrendered him\\". Thereafter the revolt collapsed. In 1651 and 1652 there was famine in Yucat√°n. The Indians hid their seeds from the Spanish, but to no effect. They also suffered frightful hunger. In Peru As a reward for the large quantity of money he had sent back to Spain, on February 22, 1653 he was named viceroy of Peru. In order to tie up affairs in New Spain, he delayed his departure until August of that year. He took office in Peru on February 24, 1655, and served until December 31, 1661. In 1657 he founded the Nautical Academy of the colony, at the Hospital of Espiritu Santo in Lima. There had been a royal mint in Lima briefly, with the king's permission, beginning in 1565, but it was soon closed. Now because of a shortage of coinage, Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n ordered it reopened in December 1658, but without the royal authority to do so. It produced coins of 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4 and 8 reales from January 1659 to April 1660, as well as 1 and 8 escudos from September 1659 to April 1660. These are known today as Estrellas de Lima (Stars of Lima), due to the large star featured in their design. Surviving examples are very rare.

Domnall was High King of Ireland from 628 until his death. He belonged to the Cen√©l Conaill kindred of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. The year of Domnall's birth is not known, and even an approximation depends on the date of the convention of Druim Cett, which is debated. Certainly he must have been born around 570 at the earliest, and around 590 at the latest. According to Adomn√°n's Life of Saint Columba, Domnall mac √Åedo met Columba at Druim Cett while still a boy. Columba prophesied great success and a peaceful death in old age for Domnall.Druim Cett is usually dated to c. 575, but it was possibly as late as 590, see Sharpe's notes 86 & 204 to Adomn√°n's Life. Sharpe's dating has found support, but is not accepted by all. Domnall's brother M√°el Cobo (died 615) is said to have been High King of Ireland, and his father √Åed also, but both claims are later inventions based on the Annals of the Four Masters and similar writings. The list of High Kings found in the Baile Chuinn C√©tchathaigh (The Frenzy of Conn of the Hundred Battles), which is dated to before 695, includes Domnall. The original writer of the Annals of Ulster named just twelve \\"kings of Ireland\\", starting with Domnall in 628-642, and ending with Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair in 1166-1186.Byrne, Irish Kings and High- Kings, pp. 256-257. The first reference to Domnall in the Annals of Ulster is for 628, a report of the battle of Both where Domnall was defeated by the reigning High King, his distant U√≠ N√©ill cousin Suibne Menn of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. Shortly after, Suibne Menn was killed by Congal C√°ech, the D√°l nAraidi king of the Ulaid. Later in the year Domnall took his army raiding into Leinster. Success in warfare was the usual test of a new king, and afterwards the Annalists assume Domnall was acknowledged as High King.This inaugural raid was known as the crech r√≠g, see √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 99. In 629, the Annals tell of battles at Fid E√≥in and D√∫n Ceithirn, although it is not clear which was fought first. At Fid E√≥in, M√°el Ca√≠ch mac Sgannail defeated the army of the D√°l Riata, clients of the Cen√©l Conaill.Presumably M√°el Ca√≠ch is either brother of Congal C√°ech, or perhaps it is a scribal error and Congal is meant. The king of D√°l Riata, Connad Cerr, and two grandsons of √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in were killed in the defeat. At D√∫n Ceithirn, Domnall inflicted a defeat on Congal C√°ech and the armies of the Ulaid and D√°l nAraidi. In addition to the defeat of the Ulaid, constant enemies of the Cen√©l Conaill, Domnall's hold on power can only have been helped by fighting amongst the other kindreds of the U√≠ N√©ill, war amongst Cen√©l nE√≥gain reported in 630, and between Clann Cholm√°in and the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine in 634-635\\\\. In 637, Domnall faced another challenge from Congal C√°ech and the Ulaid. Congal was joined by Domnall Brecc, king of D√°l Riata, and by the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. Domnall was aided by the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine. The battle of Mag Rath (Moira, County Down) was a decisive victory for the High King and Congal C√°ech was killed. On the same day as Mag Rath, the battle of Sailt√≠r (off Kintyre), fought between Domnall's fleet, led by his nephew Conall C√°el mac M√°ele Cobo, and a fleet of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain and D√°l Riata, was won by the High King's forces. The Ulaid were not the main sufferers however, as the D√°l Riata are thought to have lost their lands in County Antrim as a result of the battle. Mag Rath was attached to the Buile Shuibhne, the tale of a fictitious D√°l nAraidi king named Suibhne Gelt, which is probably much older in origin. The Annals of Tigernach report the death of Domnall's wife Duinseach in 641. Domnall died at the end of January of 642, perhaps after a long illness. Domnall was followed as king of the Cen√©l Conaill by his nephew Cellach mac M√°ele Cobo. Domnall's sons included √ìengus mac Domnaill (died 650), father of Loingsech mac √ìengusso (died 703), high king of Ireland; Fergus Fan√°t, father of Congal Cennmagair (died 710), also high king; Ailill Flann Esa (died 666) as well as Conall and Colcu (both died 663).Loingsech is also named \\"king of Ireland\\" in the original hand of the Annals of Ulster.

It is located 7 km east of the city of Trail along Highway 3B. Geography The village of Montrose is built on a mountain ledge leading to Beaver Valley. Because of its limited physical area, there is very little fluctuation in population. History Originally known as \\"Wood's Flats,\\" Montrose was developed as a retirement village for workers from the nearby Cominco (now Teck) smelter. It was incorporated in 1956 as a village, and is named after a popular resort destination in Scotland (Montrose, Angus). The construction of the \\"Montrose Cutoff,\\" an extension of Highway 3B from Fruitvale to Trail, reduced travel time to Trail from ~45 minutes to 10 minutes, making the village more attractive to commuters. Economy There is a post office, an Oriental restaurant and one combined gasoline station/corner store in the village. Other than home-based businesses, virtually all other employment is based in the nearby city of Trail. Major employers of Montrose residents include Teck, the Kootenay Boundary Regional Hospital, School District 20, Ferraro Foods, and the Trail operations of such large corporations as Fortis BC, Wal-Mart, Extra Foods (Weston Corp), Canadian Tire and international engineering consultants Wood. Montrose is known throughout the Kootenay region of BC for its excellent drinking water, a sample of which received silver medals in the 2008 and 2009 Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting Competition. Features Montrose is also the location of the \\"Antenna Trail\\" a 4 kilometre loop hiking trail that rises 250 metres above the village and has views of the Beaver and Columbia Valleys. This trail is part of the Kootenay Columbia Trail system although it is not contiguous with the rest of the trails located near, and accessed from, nearby Rossland. The Antenna Trail is popular because it is snow-free much earlier in the spring than the higher elevation trails, and has little if any mountain bike traffic. The village shares its territory with a variety of native BC wildlife. Elk, Whitetail Deer, Mule Deer, Black Bears, and Wild Turkeys are frequently spotted on Montrose Mountain, and occasionally within the village proper. Hummingbirds are attracted by the numerous feeders put out by residents, with at least seven different species recorded.

The condition is more common in those aged 50‚Äì70 years, specifically more prevalent in females than males, and more so in Caucasians than those of African descent. It is a deforming disease that causes many complications for the individual.  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of Felty's syndrome are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients suffer from painful, stiff, and swollen joints, most commonly in the joints of the hands, feet, and arms. In some affected individuals, Felty's syndrome may develop during a period when the symptoms and physical findings associated with rheumatoid arthritis have subsided or are not present; in this case, Felty's syndrome may remain undiagnosed. In more rare instances, the development of Felty's syndrome may precede the development of the symptoms and physical findings associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Felty's syndrome is also characterized by an abnormally enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and abnormally low levels of certain white blood cells (neutropenia). As a result of neutropenia, affected individuals are increasingly susceptible to certain infections. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca may occur due to secondary Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Individuals with Felty's syndrome may also experience fever, weight loss, and/or fatigue. In some cases, affected individuals may have discoloration (abnormal brown pigmentation) of the skin, particularly of the leg, sores (ulcers) on the lower leg, and/or an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly). In addition, affected individuals may have abnormally low levels of circulating red blood cells (anemia), a decrease in circulating blood platelets that assist in blood clotting functions (thrombocytopenia), abnormal liver function tests and/or inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). = Complications = * Recurrent infection * Enlargement of the spleen causing too few red blood cells and platelets in the bloodstream * Enlarged lymph nodes * Skin hyperpigmentation * Cutaneous ulceration  Causes  The cause of Felty's syndrome is unknown, but it has been found to be more common in those with chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Some patients share the HLA-DR4 serotype. This syndrome is mostly present in people having extra articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. People with this syndrome are at risk of infection because they have a low white blood cell count.  Mechanism  The underlying pathogenesis of Felty's syndrome is not clear. = Rheumatoid Arthritis = A 65 year old patient with rheumatoid arthritis displaying swan neck deformity. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints due to attack by the body's own immune system. In this condition, the white blood cells travel through the blood stream to the synovial joints and release pro-inflammatory cytokines upon arrival. The result of this chemical release causes the synovial cells to release harmful chemicals in response as well as begin the growth of new blood vessels, forming a pannus. The pannus receives blood supply from the newly formed vessels and grows inward, invading the articular cartilage and bone within the joint. The damage to the once healthy tissue causes inflammation and ultimately fluid build-up in the joint. An accumulation of fluid results and the joints swell, slowly decreasing the space that keeps the bones from touching. If this condition is not treated, the joint space will completely narrow, causing ankylosis. At the advanced stage of ankylosis, joint mobility is completely occluded. Early presentation is commonly seen in the joints of hands and of the feet. As the disease progresses it can be seen in the knees, wrists, hips, and shoulders. This condition can affect and damage several other body systems such as the eyes, heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition that cannot be cured but symptoms can be treated using certain medications alone or in conjunction. Due to the increased inflammatory response of the body's immune system, this condition can cause a reduction in red and white blood cells. =Neutropenia= In Felty's syndrome, chronic activation of neutrophils progresses to neutropenia and unabated infections.Dwivedi, N., & Radic, M. (2012). Neutrophil activation and B-cell stimulation in the pathogenesis of Felty's syndrome. Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej, 122(7-8), 374-379. Neutropenia is a decreased concentration of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells among white blood cells and play an important role in the immune system by destroying bacteria via phagocytosis. Inflammatory chemicals draw neutrophils to the area where they congregate and fight infection. A decrease in the number of neutrophils stimulates an autoimmune response which leads to arthritis. The loss and destruction of neutrophils leading to neutropenia is therefore, inflammation- driven due to the body's need for the immune response. = Splenomegaly = Splenomegaly is a condition of the spleen causing it to be enlarged. The splenic condition involving Felty syndrome is more specifically noted as inflammatory splenomegaly. The spleen is an important lymphatic organ that is involved in filtration of the blood by discarding old and damaged red blood cells as well as maintaining platelet levels. The spleen is a lymphatic organ, which means it is largely involved in the immune system and immune responses. When the spleen becomes enlarged, it is a strong sign of infection somewhere in the body, and can be caused by inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The increased need for production assistance of white blood cells to affected areas causes hyperfunction of the spleen. This increase in defense activities ultimately causes hypertrophy of the spleen, leading to splenomegaly. The spleen is found in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the peritoneal cavity and due to its enlargement, can cause stress on neighboring organs.  Diagnosis  This condition affects less than 1% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of three conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and an abnormally low white blood cell count are indications that Felty's syndrome is possibly occurring. This condition as a whole is difficult to diagnose due to its complexity given a combination of disorders. It is commonly overlooked or misdiagnosed as other conditions (e.g., leukemia, systemic lupus erythrematosus)Woolston, W 2017, 'Felty's Syndrome: A Qualitative Case Study', MEDSURG Nursing, vol. 26, no. 2, pp. 105-118. because of the rarity and lack of good understanding about it. An acronym can be used to make recognizing this disease somewhat easier: S: Splenomegaly A: Anemia N: Neutropenia T: Thrombocytopenia A: Arthritis (rheumatoid) = Conditions of the Blood = A complete blood count (CBC) can be done to diagnose anemia (normochromic, normocytic), thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Abnormal liver function tests are commonly used to help in diagnosis as the spleen and liver are strongly affected by one another. = Splenomegaly = If rheumatoid arthritis is present and other symptoms occur that are not commonly found within RA itself, such as a palpable spleen, further testing should be done. A palpable spleen is not always a clinical significance, therefore CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound can be administered in order to help diagnose the condition. According to Poulin et al, dimensional guidelines for diagnosing splenomegaly are as follows: Updated Apr. 2012 (referring the classification system to Poulin et al. * Moderate if the largest dimension is 11‚Äì20 cm * Severe if the largest dimension is greater than 20 cm = Rheumatoid Arthritis = RA in patients with Felty's syndrome is chronic (after 10‚Äì15 years), and presents with increased severity along with extra articular manifestations. RA can be mistaken for other conditions such as gout if not clinically diagnosed. Diagnosis can be confirmed by use of X-rays or synovial fluid analysis.Eggebeen AT (2007). \\"Gout: an update\\". Am Fam Physician. 76 (6): 801‚Äì8. PMID 17910294. Treatment There is no real treatment for Felty's syndrome, rather the best method in management of the disease is to control the underlying rheumatoid arthritis. Immunosuppressive therapy for RA often improves granulocytopenia and splenomegaly; this finding reflects the fact that Felty's syndrome is an immune-mediated disease. A major challenge in treating FS is recurring infection caused by neutropenia. Therefore, in order to decide upon and begin treatment, the cause and relationship of neutropenia with the overall condition must be well understood. Most of the traditional medications used to treat RA have been used in the treatment of Felty's syndrome. No well-conducted, randomized, controlled trials support the use of any single agent. Most reports on treatment regimens involve small numbers of patients. Splenectomy may improve neutropenia in severe disease. Use of rituximab and leflunomide have been proposed. Use of gold therapy has also been described. Prognosis Prognosis is dependent on the severity of symptoms and the patient's overall health.  History  The condition was named after its founder Augustus Roi Felty (1895-1964), after the doctor reportedly saw 5 patients in 1924 with a combination of conditions never before documented. The presence of chronic arthritis, splenomegaly, and leucopenia in all 5 patients prompted him to use his name to define the unknown syndrome.

Unlike previous installments, it only saw release in Japan and the PAL region. It was released a total of three times in Europe; it originally came out on June 30, 2000, and was re-released on the white label range on April 12, 2001, and was re-released again by Play It On, November 20, 2003. Gameplay Plot Ten years after the events of Toshinden 3, Eiji Shinjo, who is now the new leader of an organization called the \\"Gerard Foundation\\", has organized a fourth Toshinden tournament which revolves around the gathering of four holy weapons that can be used to either save the world or destroy it. Eiji's old enemy, Vermilion, is after the four holy weapons for his own malevolent ambition and that many fighters from within the tournament, including Eiji's own nephew Subaru, will find themselves getting caught from within the conflict itself. Can Eiji stop Vermilion before it's too late? A plot point introduced in this game focused on the Four Sacred Arms. Though seen in full since Battle Arena Toshinden 2, their relevance was never previously brought up. Each weapon bears a reference to one of the Chinese cardinal beasts, Byakko, Suzaku, Seiryu and Genbu. The weapons also seem to change appearance depending on the user. While the Byakko no tachi (White Tiger Fang) is usually seen as a rather plain katana, the Seiryuu no yari (Azure Dragon Spear) was a long leaf tipped spear while held by Mondo, yet altered to an ornate golden rod in the hands of Eos. As a purely cosmetic addition, when using a certain attack, an image of the beast associated with the weapon will display in the background. Plotwise, it was said that when all four weapons were gathered together, they would bestow tremendous power on a person. Most characters in the game have their endings based around uniting the weapons and receiving the power of them. In some endings, they use this power to speak to a parent or loved one. However, Eiji's ending reveals the true nature of the power behind the weapons: It is the \\"Toshin\\", or god of fighting.

Bang Boo and Eos's warm up animations also had the ends cut resulting in a sudden jump in their animations. Reception The game was poorly received.

In its sexual stage (teleomorph) it is a parasite on scarab beetles. It forms a small, compound ascocarp that arises from the cadaver of its host beetle. In its asexual stage (anamorph) it is a white mold that grows on soil. It is much more commonly found in its asexual stage and this is the stage that was originally given the name Tolypocladium inflatum. History In 1969, a soil sample containing microfungi from Norway, found by Hans Peter Frey. was brought to Switzerland from which a fungus misidentified as Trichoderma polysporum was isolated. In 1971 the Austrian mycologist, Walter Gams, re-identified the isolate as a previously unknown microfungus affiliated with the order Hypocreales. He erected the genus Tolypocladium to accommodate the isolate which he named T. inflatum Gams. The taxon is characterized by swollen phialides, sparingly branched conidiophores, and small, unicellular conidia borne in slimy heads. Canadian mycologist John Bissett re-examined the strain in 1983, finding it to match the species Pachybasium niveum, a fungus described prior to the work of Gams. According to the rules of publication priority for botanical nomenclature, Bissett proposed the combination Tolypocladium niveum. However due to the economic importance of the fungus to the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that the incorrect name had already become well-entrenched, a proposal to formally conserve the name T. inflatum against earlier names was made and accepted, establishing the correct name of the mold that produces ciclosporin as Tolypocladium inflatum. Growth and morphology Tolypocladium inflatum occurs most commonly in soil or leaf litter, particularly at high latitudes in cold soils. The species is characterized by spherically swollen phialides that are terminated with narrow necks bearing subglobose conidia. T. inflatum is highly tolerant of lead and has been found to dominate the mycota of lead- contaminated soils. A study conducted by Baath et al. found that 35% of the fungal isolates recovered from lead-laden soil were T. inflatum. In 1996, Kathie Hodge of Cornell University and colleagues determined that the mold T. inflatum was the asexual state of what was then known as Cordyceps subsessilis. Cordyceps subsessilis was later moved to the genus Elaphocordyceps. However, under the ICN's 2011 \\"one fungus, one name\\" principle, fungi can not have different names for their anamorphic and teleomorphic stages if they are found to be the same species so Elaphocordyceps subsessilis was made a synonym of Tolypocladium inflatum. The genome of the T. inflatum strain/isolate NRRL 8044 (ATCC 34921) was sequenced and published in 2013 by Bushley and colleagues. This was the same strain from which the ciclosporin was first isolated. Metabolite production Tolypocladium inflatum is similar to other fungi in the order Hypocreales in generating a variety of biologically active secondary metabolites. Two significant groups of metabolites are produced from T. inflatum: ciclosporins and efrapeptins. Ciclosporin exhibits insecticidal and antifungal properties and is a key immunosuppressant drug used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. Ciclosporin A also has the potential use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The genome of filamentous T. inflatum contains a 12-gene cluster associated with a repetitive element. Efrapeptins are mitochondrial and prokaryotic ATPase inhibitors that also have insecticidal and antifungal properties. Little is known about the role of these metabolites in the ecology of the fungus. In 2011, Linn and co-workers studied crude extracts of T. inflatum and found that the fungus produced six new secondary metabolites and four other chlamydosporol derivatives. Pathogenicity Although Tolypocladium inflatum is chiefly as a soil fungus its sexual state has been encountered as a pathogen of insects, specifically beetle larvae. Hodge and co-workers suggested that the fungus may have originated as an insect pathogen but evolved over time survive asexually as a facultative soil saprobe. Although T. inflatum has not been shown to affect nematodes, researchers Samson and Soares hypothesized that the Tolypocladium species may have a nematode alternate host. Tolypocladium inflatum has also shown to produce substances that inhibit the in vitro growth of a number of fungal species. Some suggest that T. inflatum may also have the ability to inhibit certain fungal plant pathogens from colonizing their hosts. For example, T. inflatum had a small but significant effect on inhibiting mycorrhiza formation. Furthermore, secondary metabolites isolated from the crude extract of T. inflatum have shown modest cytotoxicity against eight human tumour cell lines including A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), A375 (human malignant melanoma), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer). Medical uses Tolypocladium inflatum has long been of interest in biotechnology due to its production of a relatively non-cytotoxic, natural 11 amino acid cyclic peptide named Ciclosporin A. Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant drug used in the management of autoimmune diseases and the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation. Ciclosporin A works by targeting and binding with human ciclophilin A. This ciclosporine-ciclophilin binding inhibits calcineurin and effectively inhibits the human immune system. Without calcineurin, the activity of nuclear factor of activated T-cells and transcription regulators of IL-2 in T-lymphocytes is blocked. Ciclosporin A considerably alters the nuclear morphology of in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from ovoid to a radially splayed lobulated structure. The expression levels of alanine racemase affects the level of cyclosporine production by T. inflatum. Ciclosporin A was first introduced in medical use in the 1970s after an organ transplant to reduce graft rejection. This use was based on cyclosporin‚Äôs ability to interfere with lymphokine biosynthesis. Ciclosporin A also has anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antiparasitic abilities. It has been recommended for autoimmune diseases as well as potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and HIV-1. Despite its use in medicine, cyclosporine A exhibits significant nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and hepathotoxicity. Drugs containing T. inflatum-produced cyclosporin A are a major product of the pharmaceutical company, Novartis.

It runs west from the high plateau between Shotts and Fauldhouse to its joining with the much larger River Clyde. The high plateau is also the watershed of the River Almond, which flows east into the River Forth.  Etymology  The etymology of the name is not confirmed but is most likely from the Cumbric language, a language closely related to modern Welsh and was spoken across the Strathclyde area throughout the Early Middle Ages to about 1200 AD. The proposed etymology would come from the words \\"caled dwr\\", meaning \\"hard water\\", most likely either referring to the strength of the current or the rocky riverbed beneath the water.  History  It is known that the ancient Romans constructed roads through Wishaw and Motherwell not too far from the river, and the ruins of the fort at Bothwellhaugh lies at the convergence of the Calder with the Clyde. Supposedly, a bridge that crosses the river at Bothwellhaugh was built by the Romans, but the accuracy of this claim is doubted. In the early 1600s, a large manor was constructed on the banks of the river and named Wishaw House, as well as the purchase of several local farmsteads. It is thought that this house was inherited through generations of nobles until its was abandoned and eventually demolished in the 1950s. Course The South Calder Water follows a short course of approximately 10 miles, during which it winds round Shotts, Wishaw and Motherwell before flowing into the Strathclyde Loch. Between its source at Calderhead and Newmains the stream follows a wide glacial valley and passes the villages of Bonkle and Murdostoun Castle, but after Newmains, until its end at Strathclyde Loch in Motherwell, it cuts through a very deep and meandering valley. It lies on the edge of areas of Wishaw such as Bonkle and Coltness. This valley was filled in at Ravenscraig during the construction of Ravenscraig steelworks to provide a large flat area. The river is therefore placed in a \\"cut and cover\\" tunnel as it passes for approximately 1/2 mile underneath the site, before reappearing at Jerviston. Driving across the now derelict Ravenscraig site gives no clues as to the underground river flowing below. The river ends at Strathclyde Loch, where it used to join directly with the River Clyde. The River Clyde was diverted about 1 mile west of this point in the 1960s to create the large man made loch, which is now fed purely by water from the South Calder Water. The river is referenced in man-made features near its course, including Calder public park in Coursington (Motherwell), Calderbridge Primary School in Coltness (Wishaw) and Calderhead High School in Shotts.

He is best known for his stand-up and as Sidekick Simon in Mid Morning Matters and This Time, both with Alan Partridge. Early life Tim Key attended secondary school at Histon and Impington Village College; Hills Road Sixth Form College and subsequently the University of Sheffield, where he studied Russian. Following graduation he returned to his native Cambridge where he eventually joined the Cambridge Footlights. Through The Footlights, Key met future colleagues Tom Basden, Stefan Golaszewski and Lloyd Woolf; with whom he formed sketch group Cowards. Edinburgh Fringe Key was first noticed in the stage production Far Too Happy with the Cambridge Footlights (although not attending Cambridge University itself) which was at the Edinburgh Fringe and was nominated for a Perrier Award for Best Newcomer. This show also featured comedian Mark Watson and actress Sophie Winkleman. In 2003, Key returned to Edinburgh directing (with Mark Watson) a sketch show - \\"Non-Sexual Kissing\\" - and performing in Alex Horne's \\"Making Fish Laugh\\". The latter was nominated for a Perrier Best Newcomer Award. In 2004, Key took \\"Luke & Stella\\" to Edinburgh. This was a tragic one-man comedy play about a \\"div-boy\\" called Luke who has all sorts of problems one evening. He also performed in Alex Horne's Every Body Talks and Mark Watson's 24-hour show. In 2005, Key took the four- man sketch group Cowards to Edinburgh. Key also performed in Alex Horne's When In Rome and Mark Watson's 2005 minute show. In 2006, Cowards returned to Edinburgh and Key performed in Mark Watson's 36-hour show. In 2007, Key took his first solo poetry show to Edinburgh. It was called The Slut in the Hut and sold out.

Boundaries Old drinking fountain The Ealing Common Area is bounded by Ealing Town Centre to the west, North Ealing and Hanger Hill to the north, Acton to the east and South Ealing and South Acton to the south. The Ealing Common open space is bounded by Gunnersbury Ave (A406) to the east and the Uxbridge Road to the north. A smaller area of the common extends to the east of Gunnersbury Ave, including Leopold Road. The western boundary includes The Common and Warwick Dene, with Elm Avenue to the south. Some distance to the south is also the much larger Gunnersbury Park. Ownership The Ealing Common open space is a common land as designated by the 1866 Metropolitan Commons Act. History In August 1733 a cricket match was played on the common between Ealing & Acton and London. The result is unknown but the terms of the match were \\"for ¬£50, play or pay\\", a substantial prize. London was the sport's premier club at the time. This is the only mention of Ealing & Acton and of Ealing Common in the surviving records of early cricket. p. 8. Flora Ealing Common preserves a large area of open space with fine avenues of horse chestnut trees, most of which were planted in the late Victorian period, following the purchase of the common land by the Ealing Local Board. The northern part of the common has a large English oak tree at its centre, and London plane trees are also found with the horse chestnuts around the perimeter of the common. Charles Jones was the borough surveyor responsible for the layout. In the south-west corner of Ealing Common there is a small enclosed park, called Warwick Dene, with rose beds at its centre. Other information There is a local Conservation Area which includes streets around the common. Ealing Common is also informally used by some as the name of the area in the London Borough of Ealing surrounding Ealing Common station, which is named after the common; however, it is officially part of the Ealing district.

Walewander was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 9th round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft. During his professional career, he played for the Tigers, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, California Angels and Florida Marlins of the Major League Baseball (MLB). He attended Iowa State University and is an alumnus of Arizona State University and UCLA. Career As an infielder, Walewander's advancement to the majors was delayed by shortstop Alan Trammell and second baseman Lou Whitaker. \\"Wales\\" was finally summoned to Detroit on May 31, 1987, going 1 for 2 against the Minnesota Twins. Walewander primarily appeared as a defensive substitute or pinch-runner in the late innings. He was a key figure as the Tigers battled the Toronto Blue Jays for the division crown. In the 12th inning of the season's penultimate game against Toronto, pinch-hitter Walewander scooted home with the game-winning run after Trammell drilled a game-winning single through Toronto shortstop Manuel Lee's legs.http://archive.freep.com/article/20110626/SPORTS02/106260581/Ex-Tiger- Jim-Walewander-reflects-Sparky-Dead-Milkmen-87-division-title Detroit won the division title the next day via a Frank Tanana 1‚Äì0 shutout. Walewander was not on the playoff roster, and Minnesota defeated Tigers in the ALCS. Walewander had his own quirky style that endeared him to the fans of Detroit, who felt compelled to start The Jimmy Walewander Fan Club. His behavior was often interpreted as unconventional. He played 18 holes of golf wearing combat boots, but that was because he left his spikes at home. He used tin foil as curtains to cover the window in his Minor League apartment, because that was the only thing that kept sun out. When asked how he found Mark Langston, one of the first pitchers Walewander faced in the Major Leagues, Walewander responded, \\"I walked from the on-deck circle to the batter's box and there he was on the mound.\\" Walewander was also a fan of the Philadelphia punk band The Dead Milkmen. The punk rockers were guests in the dugout when Walewander hit his only major-league home run.http://www.chinmusic.net/Walewander.html A local Tigers fan, named \\"Eastside Billee\\" aka William Speelman, wrote a \\"theme song\\" for Walewander, called \\"The Jim Walewander Blues\\", and recorded it with his band The Ten Speeds. The song got radio airplay in the Lakeland, Florida area during spring training one year. Broadcaster Ernie Harwell even gave a Detroit newspaper review of the song in an article written by Shelby Strother. The song, and its lyrics, were also mentioned in a Sports Illustrated article regarding Walewander. Wales played one more year with the Tigers before his release. He played with the New York Yankees and then in Italy before his last game, in a California Angels uniform in 1993. For his Major League career, Walewander batted .215 with a home run and 14 RBI in 242 at-bats. Walewander's 24 runs scored on only 13 hits during the 1987 season represents the all-time record for the highest 'runs to hits' ratio (1.846) for a major league season for players with 10 or more hits. After leaving baseball, Walewander earned his undergraduate degree from Arizona State University and an MBA from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.

The Oakland Long Wharf was built, beginning 1868, by the Central Pacific Railroad on what was previously Oakland Point. Beginning November 8, 1869, it served as the west coast terminus of the First Transcontinental Railroad. In the 1880s, Southern Pacific Railroad took over the CPRR, extending it and creating a new ferry terminal building with the official station name Oakland Pier. The entire structure became commonly and popularly called the Oakland Mole. History The Oakland Long Wharf, in 1878 The first use of the site for boats was in 1852, when Gibbons' Wharf was constructed at Gibbons' Point, westward into San Francisco Bay. In 1862, Gibbons' Point was renamed Oakland Point, and the wharf was first used as a ferry landing as part of the San Francisco and Oakland Railroad service. On November 8, 1869, it succeeded Alameda Terminal and became the western terminus of the First transcontinental railroad trains. = Central Pacific = In 1868 the Central Pacific Railroad acquired this pier which it renamed the Oakland Long Wharf and immediately began extending and improving it, fully opening for business on January 16, 1871. The first through train on the transcontinental route left Oakland on the morning of November 8, 1869, with the inaugural west bound arrival at the Oakland pier that evening.History of Alameda County, v.2, p.670, published 1883 by M.W. Wood, Oakland, California Local commuter trains also used the pier, while trains of the Pacific Railroad (aka: \\"First Transcontinental Railroad\\") used another wharf in nearby Alameda for about two months in 1869 (September 6 - November 7), after which the Oakland Long Wharf became the western terminus of the Pacific Railroad as well. From there San Francisco Bay ferries carried both commuters and long distance passengers between the Long Wharf and San Francisco. The CPRR floated freight to San Francisco starting in 1871. Part of the wharf was filled in between 1879 and 1882, creating the Oakland Mole and Pier, which opened for traffic on January 22, 1882. A large depot covered in corrugated iron and glass, and lit by electric lighting was constructed. It opened in February 1881.History of Alameda County, v.2, p.631, published 1883 by M.W. Wood, Oakland, California = Southern Pacific = Approach to the Oakland Ferry Mole (1889) The Central Pacific's operations were consolidated under the Southern Pacific in the 1880s, and in 1882 the Oakland Pier was opened about a half-mile east of the west end of the Long Wharf, which was then used only for freight until being abandoned in 1919. Freight trains served docks just south of the train shed after the original was abandoned. The mole became one of the busiest piers in the United States. A huge stained-glass window of the SP logo was placed on the western end of the train shed in 1929. When the building was demolished, it was removed and put in storage. It is now at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California. For decades, Oakland Pier was the main intercity connection to San Francisco. SP operated ferries between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Oakland Pier for passengers traveling between San Francisco and intercity destinations to the east (Chicago) and north (Seattle). = Commuter trains = East Bay Moles in 1937 After January 15, 1939 the electric commuter trains of the East Bay Electric Lines no longer ran to the Oakland Pier but instead used tracks on the lower deck of the new San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, running to the Transbay Terminal in San Francisco. The station was closed to intercity traffic in 1958. The San Francisco-Oakland ferry service was replaced with buses over the Bay Bridge between San Francisco's Third and Townsend Depot and 16th Street Station, two miles from the mole. =Demolition= Throughout the pier's existence, progressively greater portions of the bayshore tidelands were filled in. It was demolished in the 1960s to make way for an expansion of the growing container ship facilities of the Port of Oakland. The only structure that remains of the Oakland Long Wharf is the SP Mole's switchman's tower, which was restored and moved to Middle Harbor Shoreline Park. =Nearby railroad wharves= In order from north to south, the other moles and wharves along the Oakland shore have included: * The Key System Pier and Mole, which extended from Yerba Buena Avenue nearly to Yerba Buena Island (built on the site of the original California and Nevada Railroad wharf) * Oakland Long Wharf/The Oakland Mole and Pier * The Western Pacific Mole began construction in 1906 and opened for business in 1910. It operated until 1933, and the passenger terminal was demolished in 1940. The area is now the Middle Harbor Shoreline Park. * The Alameda Mole existed from 1876 to the 1930s and was used to connect San Francisco to Santa Cruz via a narrow-gauge railroad, initially owned by the South Pacific Coast Railroad, which was purchased by Southern Pacific in 1878. It was also used by Red Line trolley cars, and in the 1930s Pan American built a seaplane port at the base of the mole. * The Alameda Terminal and wharf, at the foot of Pacific Avenue in Alameda, was part of the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad (1863-1870) and became the original western terminus of the First transcontinental railroad on September 6, 1869, when the first Western Pacific through train from Sacramento arrived at Alameda Terminal. In popular culture The mole in its latter years can be seen at the beginning of the 1957 movie Pal Joey as Frank Sinatra's character arrives by train and makes his way to the ferry. It also appears in the 1952 noir film \\"Sudden Fear\\" starring Joan Crawford.

It is the first novel of the trilogy A Requiem for Homo Sapiens.Brown, Charles N.. \\"David Zindell: Back to Roots\\" (excerpt), Locus, v44:6 No.473 June 2000. Retrieved on 2000-09-07. The Broken God is essentially a coming of age tale of youngster named Danlo, but at a much grander scale on a faraway planet in the distant future. Interspersed throughout the novel there is also much philosophical contemplation and musings on subjects ranging from mysticism to linguistics and metaphysics. Introduction Danlo (Danlo wi Soli Ringess) is a human child living among a tribe of Neanderthal like beings living in the mountainous island Kweitkel, on the Planet Icefall. Danlo's tribe is called the Devaki. The Devaki belong to a group of tribes called the Alaloi, who settled on the planet. Seeking a simple life, the Alaloi transformed their genetic makeup to look like Neanderthals at the time of settlement on Icefall. However, all the Devaki die of a mysterious disease. Only Danlo and another Alaloi called Soli (or Three Fingered Soli) survive the disease. Soli performs the Devaki rite for passing into manhood on Danlo, a mutilation of his penis via circumcision followed by continued mutilation of his member that creates colored strands on it and the choosing of the animal spirit. Danlo chooses Ahira, which is otherwise called the White Thallow. The White Thallow is actually a snowy owl. However, the rite exhausts Soli and he dies. Before his death, Soli tells Danlo about his true father and mother from the Unreal City (Neverness). Soli informs Danlo that he is actually Danlo's grandfather, Leopold Soli. Danlo's mother, father and Soli were humans on a scientific mission among the Alaloi, who had physically carked (not genetically transformed, but changed through surgery) their bodies to look like the Alaloi. Danlo's Mother, Katherine, was murdered 40 days before Danlo was due to be born. Danlo was cut from her womb, because his mother was accused of being a \\"satinka\\" (witch). Danlo's father (Mallory Ringess) fled back to Neverness, returning only once to the Alaloi. Soli stayed among the Devaki. Soli also tells of exploding stars in a region of space called the Vild. He instructs Danlo to travel through the snow-covered land to the city of Neverness, which lies to the east of Kweitkel. Danlo makes the perilous journey across the ice during the winter - facing snow storms, dwindling supplies and dying sled dogs - and makes it to Neverness. He is frostbitten and hungry, starved and has grown thin to the bones. On reaching Neverness he starts to look for food and encounters a group of men and women along with an alien, who do not understand Danlo's Alaloi language. He is taken into the house of the alien, a member of the Fravashi race. Neverness is the center of the galactic civilization and is home to many different alien races and the Fravashi are one among them. The Fravashi who took in Danlo is called the Old Father. The Fravashi are a race of intelligent beings who like to think and teach others to think. The Old Father is a teacher and the men and women are his students. They nurse Danlo back to health and cure his frostbite. The Old Father presents Danlo with a Shakuhachi (Japanese end-blown flute). While Danlo regains his strength the Old Father learns how to speak the Alaloi language.

History Grayson is part of the wealthy Sinclair family. He was married to Perdita Hyde-Sinclair (Georgia Slowe) and is the eldest son of Rosemary King (Linda Thorson) and brother of Alasdair Sinclair (Ray Coulthard). He first appeared at a family dinner party with Perdita, Alasdair and Sadie Campbell (Patsy Kensit). He appeared again at Alasdair and Sadie's wedding and was present when Sadie and Rosemary agreed Sadie would annul her marriage to Alasdair in return for the Sinclair business that had the most sentimental value to Rosemary. Grayson and Perdita got together, following the death of Perdita's brother, Harry. Harry died in action during the Bosnian war. He and Grayson were best friends. Rosemary told Tom King (Ken Farrington) that Grayson and Perdita met at Harry's funeral and fell in love. However, Perdita told local vet, Hari Prasad (John Nayagam), that Grayson was unfaithful. He had a gambling habit, which saw him sell some of Rosemary's paintings to Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) and made friends with Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and she accompanied him to casinos until Perdita asked her to stop. Grayson was shocked to learn that Perdita has had five miscarriages. During a heart to heart, she confessed and seemed to resent his philandering. Grayson is an experienced solicitor advocate. He advised Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw) and the villagers about how they could sue King and Sons for the show home collapse but changed sides, defending the Kings when they were charged with corporate manslaughter. Grayson is very close to his mother, Rosemary, due to the death of his father when he and his brother were young. Rosemary, Grayson and Perdita lived at Oakwell Hall until Gray and Perdita bought Mill Cottage. When Grayson was away, Perdita slept with Matthew King (Matt Healy). Worried she was pregnant, she told Grayson and admitted that Matthew could be the father. Fortunately, Perdita wasn't pregnant but the damage was done. Matthew and Grayson despised each other as Matthew felt Grayson was an idiot for not treating Perdita right while Grayson resented Matthew for trying to steal his wife. Matthew called Grayson, \\"Larry\\", a reference to comedian Larry Grayson, which Grayson hated. Matthew did this until he and Grayson had a fight over it. Matthew still did it but not to his face. In December 2006, Paul Lambert (Mathew Bose) rescued Grayson from a homophobic attack in Hotten. Paul asked Grayson what happened and Grayson told him that he is bisexual. Grayson and Paul became good friends because of this and also made friends with Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) after Perdita became Katie's business partner. Grayson advised her about her divorce from Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher). =Marriage difficulties= Grayson and Perdita's marriage was always rocky but the final straw was when he had her sectioned. Grayson struggled to cope as Perdita was refusing to see him so Paul visited for him. In Perdita's absence, Rosemary ran Mill Cottage, looked after Grayson and helped Katie run the stables. Consequently, she and Rosemary became friends. Rosemary saw Katie had feelings for Grayson and encouraged her, hoping Grayson would move on and have a family. Katie, however, kept her distance as she refused to steal her best friend's husband. Only Matthew knew Perdita was telling the truth about Rosemary and her illness but made her realise that to be released, she had to admit to her \\"illness\\". Perdita told Grayson that Rosemary was responsible but he didn't believe her until the family doctor backed her up. Grayson confronted his mother and threw her out so she moved in with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) briefly but disappeared after arguments with Grayson, Matthew and Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) . Fearing Rosemary, Perdita stayed with Matthew but when Rosemary admitted poisoning Perdita, Grayson begged Perdita to give their marriage another chance. She agreed, much to Matthew's disappointment, and began contacting surrogacy agencies to discover if they could have a family. In October 2007, Rosemary's handbag and passport were seen under a bush when Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox) was walking Tootsie. A few days later, Paddy found them. He told the police and, in her diary, on the day of her disappearance, they found an entry \\"MK MF\\", which they guessed meant \\"Matthew King, Manor Farm\\". When the police searched the farm, they found coffee cups with Matthew and Rosemary's fingerprints and traces of her blood. They concluded Matthew asked Rosemary to meet him at Manor Farm, made her a coffee and killed her. Matthew was arrested and charged with Rosemary's murder and released on bail. In October 2007, Perdita told Katie about her and Grayson's plans to hire an American surrogate, due to American law favouring genetic parents, unlike British law. Katie offered to be surrogate and they agreed. Touched by Katie's offer, Grayson asked her to move in with them. He wanted to look after her but Perdita was annoyed about this. When Perdita found a negative pregnancy test, she and Matthew started making plans to get together but discovered that Katie had merely done a test too early. Perdita changed her mind about leaving as she wanted her baby, planning to leave once she had custody. However, Grayson found out and framed Matthew for Rosemary's murder but Perdita found evidence of this and blackmailed Grayson so he cleared Matthew and would give her sole custody. Matthew was released and Perdita moved into Home Farm with him. Grayson was devastated to lose Perdita but Katie was furious. She and Grayson became an item and when she learned about the blackmail, she persuaded Perdita to burn her evidence before revealing that she and Grayson were together and intended to keep the baby. Furious, Perdita physically attacked Katie, almost causing a miscarriage. Luckily, the baby was fine. Following this, Grayson warned Perdita she would have a fight for any contact and told Matthew why Perdita and Katie were fighting. Matthew was horrified to discover this and threw her out, saying he never wanted to see her again. She moved in with Paul and Jonny as Paul was the only friend she had left in the village. =Revenge= When Katie came home, Perdita dropped a bombshell - Grayson's bisexuality. Katie didn't believe her but Grayson admitted it. Diane told Grayson that he had to tell the truth if he wanted a future with her. Katie was shocked but told Grayson that she would accept it as part of his past but insisted he stay faithful to her. In late March 2008, Katie was due to go for a scan and suggested inviting Perdita but Grayson persuaded her not to and learned that the baby was a boy. After the scan, Grayson and Katie went to the pub and told Diane. Jonny, Paul and Perdita saw them there and Perdita lost her temper when she heard their news. Trying to restrain Perdita, Paul and Jonny carried her outside but Grayson followed and they argued. Perdita attacked Grayson when he told her that he'd slept with Paul so he had her arrested for assault. She was cautioned and released the next day. Perdita was angry with Paul and left the area as Grayson had taken out a restraining order, telling Katie that it was in her and the baby's best interests. A couple of months later, a friend of Grayson's, visited. Richard told Grayson that Perdita wanted custody and it would be best to settle out of court, giving Grayson her address. Feeling remorse for his behaviour, he got her a nicer flat and paid the rent. Worried about upsetting Katie, Grayson didn't tell her but she found out when she took an important document to him. Realising what Grayson was doing, she suddenly realised why he was talking about Perdita and access agreements but visited Perdita a few days later, wanting answers. Perdita warned her that she couldn't trust Grayson and implied he only wanted her because she was pregnant. Katie now worried about the baby's future if she gave him to his natural parents. When Katie confided in Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) about Grayson and Perdita's behaviour, Chas suggested Katie leave but she decided to have the baby in London and put him up for adoption there. In the meantime, she tested Grayson by suggesting Perdita have custody but he stormed out in a huff, making Katie think Perdita was right. She asked Chas to go with her and be her birth partner and Chas agreed. To make sure Grayson and Perdita didn't get suspicious, she agreed to allow Perdita access and join them at the antenatal clinic but needed money for the London trip. Grayson was very well off so Katie claimed her mother had lost all her money. He wasn't happy about Katie's suggestion that she move in with them and suggested he pay her mother's debts. Katie agreed and asked him to give her the money, telling him she would send it to her mother. Claiming to be worried about finances, Katie suggested saving money by asking Perdita to move in. Grayson agreed so Perdita returned to Mill Cottage and started work at the stables. However, Katie realised that Paul and Perdita had argued and neither would explain so Jonny told her about Grayson and Paul's one night stand. She confronted Perdita and threatened to confront Grayson but Perdita begged her not to, scared Grayson would revoke her access. Katie agreed, deciding to give Perdita custody, telling Jonny but not Perdita about her decision as she worried that Perdita would say tell Grayson but Paul made Grayson suspicious about what Katie was up to. Investigating, he discovered she'd changed the date of the birth and still had the money meant for her mother. Angry at Katie's deception, he confronted her and demanded she give him custody of his son but Jonny intervened so Katie got away. She realised she was in labour and asked Matthew to collect Perdita and take her to hospital but gave birth in the car. Perdita left Grayson a message, telling him what had happened. Katie was horrified when Perdita told her and gave the baby and the ¬£20,000 to Perdita so they could leave. She and Matthew convinced Perdita that she and the baby would be better off without Grayson and Matthew distracted Grayson while Perdita left. Grayson went after them but Perdita had already gone. He got the hospital staff to phone the police and reported his son had been kidnapped. Katie told them Perdita was the baby's mother - she was just the surrogate - and gave them Perdita's mobile number. She confirmed that she and the baby were fine and asked them not to tell Grayson where she was. He sank into self-pity and was drunk constantly. Chas found Grayson in a state and told Diane. She and Paul made him pull himself together and look for Perdita and the baby. However, Paul had promised Jonny that he wouldn't see Grayson so when Jonny was upset to see them together. Grayson went out, looking for fun, but was caught by the police, charged with indecent behaviour and released. While drunk, Grayson locked himself and Katie into Victoria Cottage and demanded she tell him where Perdita was. Katie refused and escaped but he came after her. Paul and Diane saw Katie running away from him. He thought they would support him but Paul hit him for destroying his and Jonny's relationship. Nearly everyone saw this and when Donna Windsor-Dingle (Verity Rushworth) and Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) arrived, Grayson wanted Paul arrested, but nobody backed him up. Ostracized, Grayson left the next day, warning Matthew and Chas he would be back. Chas told him to stay away from Katie unless he wanted to join Rosemary in the churchyard. Matthew laughed and told Grayson that he could have had it all but it was his own fault that Katie left him and gave his baby away. Grayson returned in September, and took Matthew and Katie hostage at Home Farm. Grayson demanded they tell him where Perdita was but they refused. Grayson threatened to shoot Matthew but Katie still refused to tell him anything Jimmy (Nick Miles) and Carl King (Tom Lister) arrived later and he took them hostage too. They tried to calm him down but Grayson sneered at Carl for being a part-time father. Furious, Carl walked towards Grayson, daring him to shoot, which he did. Thankfully, Carl wasn't seriously injured. Jimmy and Matthew tackled Grayson and Katie grabbed the gun. She could have shot Grayson but Matthew persuaded her not to. Grayson allowed Katie to phone an ambulance but she called the police too and Grayson was arrested while trying to escape. Just before they left, in an unexpected kind gesture, Matthew gave Grayson the photo Perdita had sent him of her and the baby.

It is a key step of the junction tree algorithm, used in belief propagation on graphical models. The moralized counterpart of a directed acyclic graph is formed by adding edges between all pairs of non- adjacent nodes that have a common child, and then making all edges in the graph undirected. Equivalently, a moral graph of a directed acyclic graph is an undirected graph in which each node of the original is now connected to its Markov blanket. The name stems from the fact that, in a moral graph, two nodes that have a common child are required to be married by sharing an edge. Moralization may also be applied to mixed graphs, called in this context \\"chain graphs\\". In a chain graph, a connected component of the undirected subgraph is called a chain. Moralization adds an undirected edge between any two vertices that both have outgoing edges to the same chain, and then forgets the orientation of the directed edges of the graph. Weakly recursively simplicial A graph is weakly recursively simplicial if it has a simplicial vertex and the subgraph after removing a simplicial vertex and some edges (possibly none) between its neighbours is weakly recursively simplicial. A graph is moral if and only if it is weakly recursively simplicial. A chordal graph (a.k.a., recursive simplicial) is a special case of weakly recursively simplicial when no edge is removed during the elimination process. Therefore, a chordal graph is also moral. But a moral graph is not necessarily chordal., p. 50.  Recognising moral graphs Unlike chordal graphs that can be recognised in polynomial time, proved that deciding whether or not a graph is moral is NP-complete.

Biography Lynch was born in Buenos Aires. He came from a family of Irish origin, settled in the R√≠o de la Plata region since the 18th century. They were descendants of Patrick Lynch from Galway. He spent his childhood and adolescence on the large country estate of his grandfather Ventura Lynch. After the estate was sold, the family settled in La Plata, newly built capital of the Buenos Aires Province. Lynch was a lifelong recluse √† la Emily Dickinson, living all his life with two unmarried sisters in a large old house in La Plata. An eccentric, Lynch's quirky short stories have been often filmed and dramatized. He wrote more than a hundred of them, most of them in a neo-gauchoesque manner that sometimes evokes magic realism. He also strikes a genuinely and authentically popular vein. He was also a sport fan. He played professional soccer in 1901. His club, Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, was founded in 1887 and is now the oldest professional soccer club in America. He played in the first organized match recorded in La Plata.

Reilly Jr."},{"id":"4855524","text":"In Judaism, a berakhah, bracha, ''''', ''''' (; pl. , berakhot, '; \\"benediction,\\" \\"blessing\\") is a formula of blessing or thanksgiving, recited in public or private, usually before the performance of a commandment, or the enjoyment of food or fragrance, and in praise on various occasions. The function of a berakhah is to acknowledge God as the source of all blessing.Sefer Hachinuch Chap. 430 Berakhot also have an educational function to transform a variety of everyday actions and occurrences into religious experiences designed to increase awareness of God at all times. For this purpose, the Talmudic sage, Rabbi Meir, declared that it was the duty of every Jew to recite one hundred berakhot every day.Menachot 43b The Mishnah of tractate Berakhot, and the gemara in both Talmuds contain detailed rabbinical discussions of berakhot, upon which the laws and practice of reciting blessings are founded. Berakhot typically start with the words \\"Blessed are You, Lord our God...\\" One who hears another recite a berakhah answers with amen; but one who is engaged in prayer may at certain points be forbidden from other speech, including responding amen. With few exceptions, one does not respond amen to his or her own berakha, although other prayers--such as the kaddish--include \\"amen\\" in their text. Categories of blessings There are three major categories of berakhah: *on pleasurable experiences ( birkhot ha'nehenin) such as before eating food or smelling fragrances *when performing a commandment (Hebrew: birkhot hamitzvot) such as the lighting of Sabbath candles *in praise, gratitude or recognition of God's justice (Hebrew: birkhot ha'shevach v'ha'hodaya) such as upon seeing awe-inspring natural phenomena, or upon hearing very good or very bad news. Blessings over food are intended to sanctify the physical act of taking nourishment, those recited before performing a commandment serve to prevent the performance of the activity in an unthinking, rote way, and the blessings of praise serve to remind people of the presence of God in all situations. =Before enjoyment= Judaism teaches that food ultimately belongs to the one great Provider, God, and that to partake of it legitimately one must express gratitude to God by reciting the appropriate blessing beforehand.Bavli Berakhot 35a There are 6 types of blessings said before eating different foods: Ha-Motzi/Hamoytsi Mezonot/Mezoynes Ha-gefen/Hagofen Ha-\`etz/ho-eytz Ha-‚Äôadama/Ho-adomo and She- ha-kol.Mishna Berakhot 6:1 Additionally, there are 5 blessings said after eating different foods: Birkat Hamazon, Al Hamihya, Al Hagefen, Al Ha‚Äôetz and Borei Nefashot. These blessings, however, are only required if a certain predefined amount (Ke'zayit for a solid food, and Revi'it for a liquid) is consumed within a predefined time period (different for solids and liquids). =When performing a mitzvah= Blessings recited before the observance of a mitzvah (commandment) begin with the formula \\"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us through his commandments and commanded us to...\\" and mention the specific mitzvah about to be performed. The blessing over fulfilling the commandment is sometimes followed by another blessing (for example, when lighting the Chanukkah candles, the additional berakhah \\"...who performed miracles for our ancestors long ago at this season\\" is recited). When a mitzvah is performed for the first time in the year, the She'hecheyanu blessing (\\"...who has kept us alive and preserved us and enabled us to reach this season\\") is also added. Contrary to the usual pattern of making a blessing before the commandment, the blessing for relieving one's bodily needs and the blessing for ritually rinsing the hands are both recited afterwards. In the former case, it is forbidden to recite any blessing while one feels one's need, and so the blessing is postponed. In the latter case, one may also not recite the blessing beforehand since clean hands are a prerequisite for reciting the blessing. Even if one is certain that one's hands are clean (for example, at the Rabbinically-instituted rinsing before breaking bread), one still recites the blessing afterwards to avoid confusion. Also contrary to the usual pattern, blessings are said after certain public readings from the Tanakh as well as before it. Examples include the public reading of the Torah, the readings from the prophets called the Haftarah, and the recitation of Psalms of Praise, and the Psalms of the Hallel. Mitzvot for which a blessing is not recited No blessing is recited for the performance of certain commandments. Some commentators have suggested that the reason is that no blessing is said before fulfilling commandments which do not involve any action (for example, leaving the corner of the field for the poor), or the observance of which is possible only in undesirable circumstances (for example, granting a divorce, or the return of stolen goods). In the case of other commandments (for example, giving charity), commentators say it is because there is no fixed amount or limit to the observance of the commandment; however, there is no general agreement regarding the underlying principles. Abudirham wrote that there is more than one reason why these commandments do not have blessings.Abudirham, Third Gate, Blessings on Commandments Abudirham and RashbaShut haRashba 1:254 suggested a blessing is not recited for tzedakah because the recipient may refuse the gift, and blessings are not recited when it is uncertain whether the mitzvah will be performed. Baruch Epstein suggested that a blessing is not recited on interpersonal mitzvot because the standard blessing text refers to Jews being distinguished from other nations who do not perform the mitzvah; however, non- Jews do perform interpersonal good deeds.Torah Temimah on Exodus 24:12; a similar reason appears in Shut Ateret Paz, part 1 volume 2, Yoreh Deah, section 10 note 4. Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg suggested that interpersonal mitzvot are done best out of love and care for the recipient, not out of commandment or coercion, so a blessing which refers to the commandment is not recited.Sridei Esh 1:61 page 172 =Praise on various occasions= The main purpose of this category of blessings, often called \\"blessings of praise,\\" is to help remind people of the Creator at all times. These blessings are said on various occasions, including upon hearing good and bad news; on witnessing awesome natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning, high mountains or the ocean,Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, Travel Guide: Blessings for Special Sights on Arutz Sheva. or a rainbow; upon visiting a place where miracles have been performed in the past, especially in the Land of Israel, and the Birkat ha- Gomel, upon being saved from danger. The blessing Ha-tov ve-ha-metiv (\\"Blessed is He Who is good and does good\\") is recited by a person when they hear good news that will also benefit others, such as news that one has received an inheritance or when rain begins to fall after a drought. It is also said upon the drinking of additional wine that is different from that drunk previously at the meal. Structure of blessings Most blessings begin with the words Barukh Attah Adonai (\\"Blessed are You, Lord\\"). When the blessing occurs at the beginning of a prayer, the words ' (\\"our God, King of the Universe\\") are added. There are three types of formulas for benedictions: # a short blessing (', \\"short formula\\") which, after the opening words, is followed by a few words of praise specific to the occasion, for example, the blessing over bread: ' (\\"who brings forth bread from the earth\\"). # a long blessing (', \\"long formula\\"), in which the opening is followed by a more elaborate text, for example, in the first section of the Birkat Hamazon (Grace after Meals), after which a concluding blessing formula is recited at the end of the prayer, for example, ' (\\"Blessed are You, Lord, Who feeds all\\"). # the blessing forms part of a series (', \\"a blessing that is next to another\\") and the opening formula is omitted, except in the first benediction of each series, and only the conclusion is phrased in the style of a long blessing. The second section of the Birkat Hamazon, for instance, begins with the words ' (, \\"We thank You\\"), and ends with the blessing ' (\\"Blessed are You Lord, for the land and the food\\").  Safek berakhah  In certain cases it is doubtful whether a blessing should be said. For example, when someone doesn't remember whether he has already recited the proper blessing or not. One cannot argue to recite the blessing \\"just to be sure\\", because it is forbidden to say a \\"\\" (an unnecessary blessing) so as not to transgress the grave prohibition of taking God's name in vain. The ruling in such cases is to say the blessing in a D'Oraita case, and to not say it in a D'Rabbanan case. Reciting amen The most common context in which an amen is required by halakhah is after one hears a blessing recited.Orach Chaim 124:6 In fact, it is prohibited to willfully refrain from responding amen when it is indicated.Chayei Adam 6:1 The source of this requirement is the verse in Deuteronomy 32:3: \\"When I proclaim the name of Hashem, give glory to our God.\\" This mandate refers to the mention of the Tetragrammaton, which was only pronounced at certain specific times within the confines of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Whoever heard this special name of God mentioned was obliged to respond with Barukh shem kvod malkhuto l'olam va'ed (, \\"Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity\\").Deuteronomy 32:3 and associated commentary of Rashi and super commentaries Mizrachi and Gur Aryeh With the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, however, pronouncing the Tetragrammaton was prohibited,Chayei Adam 5:27 and was replaced with the pronunciation Adonai. Although this term bears significant holiness (and is in fact one of the seven names of God) and may not be pronounced without purpose, it may be pronounced when appropriate in prayer and blessings. The aforementioned response for the Tetragrammaton, however, is not warranted when one hears Adonai pronounced. The Talmudic Sages therefore mandated that one must answer amen at the completion of a blessing outside of the Temple, comparable to the barukh shem that was used in the Holy Temple.See Tractate Brachot 63a and associated commentary of Rashi, which state that barukh shem was used not only as a response to the recital of the Tetragrammaton, but also whenever one heard a blessing within the Temple. However, while \\"barukh shem is an expression of praise and honour, amen is an affirmation of belief.\\"Forst, Binyomin. The Laws of B'rachos, Artscroll 1990, page 86-87. The Talmud teaches that the word Amen is an acronym for (', \\"God, trustworthy King.\\")Tractate Shabbat 119b and Tractate Sanhedrin 111a The word amen itself is etymologically related to the Hebrew word ' (, \\"faith\\") asserting that one is affirming the fundamental beliefs of Judaism.Rietti, Rabbi Jonathan. The Greatest Promise Ever Made: The Eternity of The Jewish People (audio) Although amen, in Judaism, is most commonly stated as a response to a blessing that incorporates God's name, amen is more generally an affirmation of any declaration. Accordingly, it is customary in some communities to respond amen after each harachaman in Grace after mealsMagen Avraham 215:3, citing the Midrash and after a '. When reciting amen, it is important that the response is not louder than the blessing itself.Orach Chaim 124:12 When trying to encourage others to respond amen, however, one may raise ones voice to stir others to respond in kind.Mishnah Berurah 124:47 Since answering \\"amen\\" indicates approval of the content of the blessing, it is appropriate to answer \\"amen\\" to another's blessing even if one could not halachically recite the blessing oneself. For example, when the kohanim recite the blessing, \\"...Who has sanctified us with the holiness of Aaron, and commanded us to bless His people Israel with love,\\" the congregation responds \\"amen,\\" even though they are not descendants of Aaron the High Priest. Likewise, a Gentile may respond \\"amen\\" to a Jew's blessing, even when the blessing contains the text, \\"...Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to...,\\" since by answering \\"amen,\\" the Gentile is agreeing that the Jew was sanctified with the commandment about to be performed. So too with blessings on foods and smells; one is not required to likewise partake in order to answer \\"amen.\\" When one person recites a blessing for another, and the second says \\"amen\\", it is considered as if the second person recited the blessing by proxy. In this manner, a person can fulfill their obligation to recite kiddush, or recite a blessing before eating, without saying the actual blessing but rather the one word \\"amen\\". =Proper articulation when answering amen= When responding amen, it must be pronounced in a proper manner, consistent with its significance in Jewish law. There are a number of ways to respond amen that are discouraged as being either disrespectful or careless. The articulation of the alef (, first letter of amen in Hebrew) and its proper vowelization must be clear. If the kametz vowel is rushed and mispronounced as the vowelization of a shva, the amen is termed an amen , as ' is synonym for the shva.Orach Chaim 124:8 Another type of amen is one that is recited prior to the completion of the blessing it is being recited to follow; this comes from the Hebrew word ' (, \\"snatched\\").Orach Chaim 124:8 The impatient rush to respond amen before the blessing has even been completed is prohibited.Mishnah Berurah 124:30 If insufficient stress is placed on the nun (, the last letter of amen in Hebrew) and the mem (, the middle letter) drowns it out, this is termed an amen ketufa (, \\"a cut amen\\").Tractate Brachot 47a One must also not recite amen too quickly; one should allocate enough time for the amen as necessary to say ‚ÄôEl melekh ne‚Äôeman. Saying an ' (, \\"short amen\\") recited too quickly shows a lack of patience. =Situations in which one may not recite amen= Although it is not prohibited to say the word amen in vain, the Talmudic Sages indicated particular circumstances in which it is improper to answer amen.' Yoreh De'ah 110 (Dinei s'feik s'feika, Shach note 20) An ' (◊ê◊û◊ü ◊ô◊™◊ï◊û◊î, \\"orphaned amen\\") is one such example of an improperly recited amen. There is a dispute among the halachic authorities as to exactly what constitutes an orphaned amen. * As amen is recited as an affirmation of what a blessing has just asserted, one who is unaware of which blessing was just recited can certainly not affirm its assertion with true conviction. Therefore, if someone just arrives in a place and hears others reciting amen to an unknown blessing, he or she may not respond amen together with them.Rema Orach Chaim 124:8, 11 * The opposing view maintains a much narrower definition of amen . They assert that its application is limited to a situation in which someone is intending to hear another's blessing and respond amen with the intention of fulfilling his or her obligation to recite that blessing. In such a situation, should any member of the listening party miss hearing any of the words of the blessing, it would be equivalent to an omission of the recital of that word (in accordance with the principle of shomea k'oneh), and a response of amen would thus be prohibited, even though the listener knew which blessing was being recited.Orach Chaim 124:8 + associated Be'er Heitev * Another type of ' is when someone does not respond amen immediately after hearing the conclusion of a blessing, but rather pauses for a few seconds (toch k'dei dibur),Mishnah Brurah 124:34 thereby causing the amen to lose its connection to the blessing. Responding with such an amen is forbidden. If however some people are still responding amen to a blessing, one may begin to respond amen, even if this time interval has passed.Mishnah Brurah 124:34, 42 One may not respond amen to a ' (, \\"blessing made for nought\\").Orach Chaim 215:4 Thus, one should not respond amen to a blessing made by someone who is merely reciting the blessing for educational purposes (i.e. to learn how to recite it).Orach Chaim 215:3 Because one cannot attest to one's own blessing any more than he or she already has by reciting it, responding amen to one's own blessing is redundant and one may not do so.Orach Chaim 215:1 If the blessing is being recited on food, one who responds amen to one's own blessing will either cause a hefseik (, \\"[prohibited] interruption\\")Mishnah Brurah 215:1 or likely pronounce an amen , depending on whether one responds immediately or waits until after one swallows some food or drink, respectively. An exception to this rule is a situation in which an individual is reciting a series of blessings; in such a case, some authorities permit the individual to respond amen to the last blessing in order to signal the ending of the series. While there are many examples of series of blessings within the Jewish prayer services, Ashkenazi tradition dictates that amen is not recited at the conclusion of a series of blessings. The one exception to this is in Grace after Meals after the third blessing of Boneh Yerushalayim; in order to signify that the first three blessings are biblically mandated, as opposed to the fourth rabbinically-mandated blessing, the TalmudTractate Berachot 45b mandates that one recite amen at its closing.Mishnah Brurah 215:4 When responding amen will constitute a prohibited interruption When responding amen will constitute a ' (, \\"[prohibited] interruption\\"), one should not respond amen. An example of this type of situation would be within the evening kiddush on Jewish holidays, when the blessing of sheheheyanu is added within the kiddush prayer. By listening intently and responding amen to each blessing of the kiddush prayer, all those present can effectively fulfill their obligation to recite kiddush, even though only one person is actually reciting it, via the principle of shomea k'oneh (, \\"One who hears is the equivalent of one who recites\\"). While men either recite the ' blessing in kiddush or dispense their obligation by listening to someone else recite it, women generally recite their ' during candle lighting. Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank notes that anyone who lit candles should refrain from responding amen to the ' blessing during kiddush because it would effectively be an interruption in their fulfillment of reciting kiddush, as they have already recited their ' blessing.

It is a close relative of Halisaurus, and part of the same subfamily, the Halisaurinae. It is known from the Late Cretaceous of North America, Colombia and Sweden. Originally, this taxon was included within Halisaurus, but was placed in its own genus, which also led to the subfamily Halisaurinae being created for the two genera.  Discovery and naming  Eonatator is known from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Chalk Formation (Late Coniacian to Early Campanian) of Kansas, from the Eutaw Formation (Santonian) and Mooreville Chalk Formation (Selma Group; Santonian-Lower Campanian) of Alabama (United States), from the Kristianstad Basin of southern Sweden (late early Campanian), and the unit Nivel de Lutitas y Arenas (Campanian) of the Olini Group in La Mesa, Colombia. The name Eonatator means \\"dawn swimmer\\" (Greek eos = dawn + Latin natator = swimmer). Originally, it contained only a single species, E. sternbergii. The species is named in honour of Charles H. Sternberg and his son, Levi, who discovered the type specimen in the Niobrara Chalk during the summer of 1918. A second species, E. coellensis, was named for the town of Coello in the Department of Tolima in Colombia, near of which it was discovered.  Description  Eonatator was among the smaller mosasaurs. The length of the type skeleton, which represents an adult, is only 2.65 meters in length. Like many mosasaurs, it likely fed primarily on fish and smaller marine reptiles. The length of the type specimen of E. coellensis, IGM p 881237 (which lack a complete tail), is of 2.8 meters until the last preserved caudal vertebrae, with a skull of 41,5 centimeters. The specimen of this species is remarkable for having remains of soft tissue in the ear region, the neck, thoracic and the abdominal region. Under the pygal vertebrae and the seventeenth dorsal vertebra there is a series of 20 small vertebrae centra and a flattened bone, that together measure 25 centimeters in length. It have features of the mosasauroids, with three vertebrae with haemal arches and procoelic centra, that suggest the possibility that these small bones belong to an embryo of this species, although the lack of diagnostic fossils like the skull or teeth prevents a complete identification. In any case, it will be consequent with the ovoviviparism previously reported in mosasauroids like Carsosaurus. Bardet et al. (2005, p. 465) diagnose Eonatator sternbergii as follows: \\"Ambiguous characters: premaxilla-maxilla lateral suture ending posterior to 9th maxillary teeth; tail about 40% of the head and trunk length (convergent in mosasaurines); caudal vertebra length greater than width; fewer than four pygal vertebrae; femur length about twice distal width (convergent in Clidastes). Autapomorphies: parietal with smooth triangular table extending very far posteriorly, bearing medium-sized circular foramen, located at distance twice its diameter from the frontal-parietal suture, and surrounded anteriorly and posteriorly by two parallel ridges; rounded quadrate with regularly convex tympanic ala (wing); vertebral formula: seven cervicals, 24 dorsals, four pygals, 28 median caudals and at least 41 terminal caudals; humerus length approximately 2.5x distal width.\\" E. coellensis is diagnosed by more retracted nostrils, between the 7 and the 17 maxillary teeth, premaxilla and maxilla with a short rostrum anterior to the first teeth; presence of a septomaxilla, a large prefrontal that makes most of the margin of the outer nostril, a short and wide frontal, a parietal foramen located near of the fronto-parietal suture, a triangular surface of the parietal with two medial depressions and 22 caudal vertebrae.  Classification  Like many mosasaurs, this genus has a complicated taxonomic history. The type specimen (UPI R 163, Uppsala University Palaeontological Institute, Uppsala, Sweden), a nearly complete skeleton, was originally referred to the genus Clidastes by Wiman and then to Halisaurus by Russell. Hence, Clidastes sternbergii became Halisaurus sternbergii. However, by the late 1980s, some paleontologists began to suggest that H. sternbergii belonged in its own genus and that Halisaurus was polyphyletic. In 2005, Halisaurus sternbergii was reassigned to its own genus, Eonatator by Nathalie Bardet and colleagues along with the description of Halisaurus arambourgi and the creation of the subfamily Halisaurinae. Below is a cladogram following an analysis by Takuya Konishi and colleagues (2015) done during the description of Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans, which showcases the internal relationships within the Halisaurinae. The analysis excluded the dubious Halisaurus onchognathus and the genus Pluridens.  References   Further reading  * Lindgren J, Siverson M. 2005.

He has worked with Alan Licht, Jim O'Rourke, bassist Darin Gray, Thurston Moore, John Fahey, Keiji Haino, Jandek, Suzanne Langille, poet Steve Dalachinsky, Chan Marshall, Margarida Garcia, Kath Bloom and Robert Crotty. Biography Connors was born in New Haven, Connecticut and studied art at Southern Connecticut State University and the University of Cincinnati in the early 1970s, before deciding to pursue music rather than visual art. An early champion of his music was Dr. William Ferris, noted blues historian who served as head of the National Endowment for the Arts under the Clinton Administration. Connors made contact with him in the late 1970s, while Dr. Ferris was teaching at Yale University. Although Ferris did not know it at the time, Connors was the janitor who cleaned his office. Many years later, Ferris wrote the liner notes for a sweeping compilation CD set of Connors's seven- inch recordings, called \\"Night Through.\\" Best known as a composer and improviser on acoustic and electric guitar, Connors has released over 50 albums, on commercial record labels such as Table of the Elements and Father Yod as well as on his own Black Label, St. Joan and Daggett self publishing imprints. They include spare solo and duo blues, ensemble experimental jazz, noise, drones, and folk music. From 1981-1984, Connors released six limited edition albums with singer-guitarist Kath Bloom. In the mid-1980s, Connors took a partial break from music and honed his compositional skills by focusing on the art of haiku. He received the 1987 Lafcadio Hearn Award, and he and life partner Suzanne Langille also co-wrote an article on blues and haiku, \\"The Dancing Ear,\\" published in the Haiku Society of America's journal. (A book of Connors's work from this period, \\"Autumn Sun,\\" was re-released by Thurston Moore and Byron Coley a couple decades later.) He wrote under the name Loren Mattei, and a music recording from this period, \\"Ribbon o' Blues,\\" was also released under that name. Soon after returning to music, Connors began working with layered tracks. The first of this period was the \\"In Pittsburgh\\" album, released in 1989 (reissued by the Dexter's Cigar label in 1996). This approach to recording continued through the 1990s. Langille's vocals were featured on several recordings, and she also helped edit the music. Many of these releases were on the RoadCone label, managed by Mike Hinds. Such recordings were interspersed with live performances of guitar duets. The first of those recordings was with Japanese guitarist Keiji Haino, introduced to Connors by WFMU DJ David Newgarten, who then produced the recording, released in 1995. This was followed by the first of several recordings with guitarist Alan Licht in 1996. In the mid-to-late 1990s he led the blues-rock group Haunted House with Langille, Andrew Burnes (of the band San Agustin), and percussionist Neel Murgai. Connors and Langille also joined with San Agustin's David Daniell and Burnes for a recording on the Secretly Canadian label. In the late 1990s, Connors and John Fahey met at a Chicago event, introduced by guitarist Jim O'Rourke. Fahey, who died in 2001, included on his last CD, released posthumously in 2003, a piece called, \\"Red Cross, Disciple of Christ Today (for Guitar Roberts),\\" referring to Connors's nickname. In the mid-2000s, Connors met and performed with Jandek, a long-time improviser whose unique independence and originality had often been compared to Connors's. He worked very closely with poet Steve Dalachinsky (who passed away in 2019) and also with multi-instrumentalist Daniel Carter. Since the 1990s, Connors's main label has been Family Vineyard, managed by Eric Weddle. Connors was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1992. He continues to perform and record. Some of Connors' works are archived at the Blues Archive of the University of Mississippi. The University of South Carolina has a comprehensive archive of Connors' recordings and materials. In 2003 he composed and recorded a score for the film Why Can‚Äôt I Stop This Uncontrollable Dancing?. In 2012 his composition, \\"The Murder of Joan of Arc,\\" was used as one of two alternative soundtracks for a reissue by Criterion Collection and Eureka Entertainment of Carl Dreyer's silent film, The Passion of Joan of Arc.

Burke (October 9, 1915 - November 4, 1999) was an Irish-American journalist, poet and playwright. He was born in Buffalo, New York on October 9, 1915, the son of Joseph Raymond Burke and Josephine Catherine Keating. He was married on October 19, 1940 to Josephina Battaglia the daughter of Carmelo Battaglia of Monte Maggiore Belsito, Palermo, Sicily, and Antonia Fasulo of Burgio, Agrigento, Sicily. Burke signed-up with Troop E, 121st Cavalry Regiment, United States National Guard in the 1930s and, after the Guard was federalised, was stationed at Fort McClellan in Alabama from October 15, 1940, until 1941. At the outbreak of World War II, he and his wife moved to New York City where he worked for the United States Office of War Information, handling information for the British, Scandinavian and Russian desks. In the 1950s, he became News Director of WBEN Radio and WBEN-TV in Buffalo, New York. Later, as a journalist for the Buffalo Evening News, he traveled to Rome for the final session of Vatican II in 1965 and covered Pope Paul's historic appearance before the United Nations. During his 28-year career at the Buffalo newspaper he received numerous awards, including the New York State Associated Press Association Award for a series of articles entitled Free Wheeling in WNY about his 1972 bicycle tour of Western New York. He also wrote a weekly nature column which was illustrated with his own thumbnail sketches. After retiring from the Buffalo Evening News in 1977 he wrote articles on Spanish galleon hunting and lost treasures for national magazines and researched the Spanish occupation of the Caribbean. He was struck by a speeding motorist in front of his home in Amherst, New York on November 4, 1999. At the time of his death he was working on a screenplay and several plays.

It is the largest North American species in the Catostomidae or \\"sucker\\" family, and is one of the longest-lived and latest- maturing freshwater fishes, capable of living beyond 110 years and reproducing infrequently. It is commonly called the gourdhead, marblehead, redmouth buffalo, buffalofish, bernard buffalo, roundhead, or brown buffalo. The bigmouth buffalo is not a carp, nor is any other fish in the sucker family. Although they share the same order, each belong to different suborders and are native to separate continents. The bigmouth buffalo is typically a brownish olive color with dusky fins, but can vary greatly in color across individuals. Like other catostomids it has a long dorsal fin, but unlike all others it has a terminal (forward-facing) mouth reflecting its unique, pelagic feeding ecology. It is the largest of the buffalo fish and can reach a length of more than and in weight. Generally, it lives in sluggish areas of large rivers and in lakes. Bigmouth buffalo populations have been in decline in the northern extent of their range since the 1970s, including parts of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Canada. A 2019 study documented their late maturity, centenarian longevity, and that several populations in northwestern Minnesota are comprised mainly (85-90%) of individuals more than 80 years old, indicating recruitment failure since the 1930s. These life history attributes, including the ability to survive decades with virtually no successful recruitment (i.e. periodic recruitment), are shared by other long-lived freshwater fishes, including sturgeon. Such species require time to successfully sustain themselves, surviving to periods in which favorable environmental conditions arise that allow for booms in reproduction and subsequent recruitment. Management of bigmouth buffalo is thus in urgent need of reevaluation, at least in the northern part of their US range where populations are already declining; there are no limits on harvest, and night bowfishing was recently legalized, allowing a new and growing form of exploitation. Geographic distribution The bigmouth's native distribution is confined to the countries of Canada and the United States of America. It is native to the Red River of the North and Mississippi River drainage basins, from Manitoba, Canada, and North Dakota, United States, to the Ohio River and south in the Mississippi River system to Texas and Alabama. In Canada, they inhabit the Milk River which flows through Alberta, and the Qu'Appelle River which flows through Saskatchewan and Manitoba into Lake Winnipeg. Beginning in the northern United States, they are native to Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and down to southern states including eastern Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The major systems where they are found include the Hudson Bay and Mississippi River drainages. The introduction of bigmouth has largely been done for commercial purposes. Regions of reintroductions include some reservoirs along the Missouri River drainage of North Dakota and Montana. Regions of introduction include some reservoirs in Arizona, and within California, they have also been introduced to the aqueduct system of Los Angeles.Edwards, E.A. 1983. Habitat Suitability Index Models: Bigmouth Buffalo. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. FWS/OBS-82/10.34. 23 pp.left Bigmouth buffalo - these gentle giants are the oldest confirmed freshwater fish  Ecological, cultural, and economic importance  Native to North America, bigmouth buffalo are integral to ecosystems therein. Bigmouth buffalo young are prey for several predatory fish, including walleye, northern pike, catfish, alligator gar, etc. Bigmouth buffalo filter-feed on invasive zebra mussels during the mollusk's larval (veliger) planktonic stage. They form the native counterpart to the invasive bighead and silver carp, and they compete with the invasive common carp. However, these invasive species are outcompeting native bigmouth buffalo. Native Americans utilized bigmouth buffalo, Lewis and Clark harvested them on their journey in 1804, and the inland commercial fishing industry has valued them as a prized catch since the 1800s. The bigmouth buffalo is a popular foodfish throughout the United States, and has been introduced into a few southwestern states. Commercial harvesters have to obtain annual permits to net from designated waterbodies, which are rotated among on a year-by-year basis, and they must report harvest from each haul to their respective state agency. Bigmouth buffalo are then trucked in oxygenated water tanks to markets where they are sold alive. Though it has small bones suspended in its muscle tissue like northern pike, its good flavor makes it one of the most valuable of the traditional, non-game freshwater fish. In addition to being a foodfish, the bigmouth buffalo has recently become a sportfish, as night and day bowfishing have become increasingly popular since 2010. Ecology Bigmouth buffalo young feeding on plankton. Juvenile bigmouth buffalo are preyed on by predatory fish, such as walleye, northern pike and catfish. The bigmouth buffalo has a rather unique, pelagic ecology of shallow-water systems. The larval bigmouths are pelagic and sometimes benthic feeders of copepods and cladocerans mostly, but also eat phytoplankton and chironomids.McComish, T.S. 1967. Food Habits of Bigmouth and Smallmouth Buffalo in Lewis and Clark Lake and the Missouri River. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 96: 70-74. Bigmouth buffalo, unlike its close relatives the black and smallmouth buffalos, is a pelagic filter-feeder, using its very fine gill rakers to strain zooplankton from the water. It sometimes feeds near the bottom, using short up-and down movements to filter from the water the animals that hover near the bottom or rest lightly on it.(Pflieger 1997) The juveniles and adults are mostly limnetic plankton feeders that also eat cladocera, copepods, algae, Chironomidae, ostracods, and other insect larvae and invertebrates depending on availability.Applegate, R.L. and Starostka, V.J. 1970. Food Selectivity of Bigmouth Buffalo, Ictiobus cyprinellus, in Lake Poinsett, South Dakota. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 99: 571-576.Johnson, J.E., Minkley, M.L., Rinne, J.N., and Willoughby, S.E. 1970. Foods of Buffalofishes, Genus Ictiobus, in Central Arizona Reservoirs. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 99: 333-342. The optimum habitat for spawning bigmouth buffalo is highly vegetated waters. They are a very resilient fish that can tolerate high turbidity and low oxygen levels. They can be found in waters with turbidity levels over 100 ppm. A minimum total dissolved solids is 200 ppm during the growing season. During spring and summer, 50‚Äì75% pools should be present, with backwaters, and marsh areas and 25-75% littoral area and protected embayments during summer for the habitat to be suitable. Bigmouth can be found in waters from 22.5‚Äì38.0 ¬∞C, but their preferred temperature is between 31 and 34 ¬∞C. The optimal temperatures for incubation and hatching of eggs are from 15-18 ¬∞C, but they can develop in temperatures reaching up to 26.7 ¬∞C. The bigmouth prefers slow-moving water that does not reach a velocity over 30 cm/s. Salinity can be a problem for reproduction. Spawning can occur from 1.4-2.0 ppt of salinity which eggs and yearlings not being able to survive a salinity of over 9 ppt.Hollander, E.E. and Avault, J.W. 1975. Effects of Salinity on Survival of Buffalo Fish Eggs Through Yearlings. The Progressive Fish-Culturist 37: 47-51 The minimum dissolved oxygen during the spring and summer is 5 mg/l.alt= The bigmouth buffalo migrates upstream to spawning in the spring, usually April to June, where it lays its eggs on plants to which they adhere. More than one male will assist in spawning by moving the female to the top of the water to help mix eggs and milt. This species of buffalo will also occasionally spawn in rock and gravel (open substrata) in the spring.Simon, T. P. 1999. Assessment of Balon‚Äôs reproductive guilds with application to Midwestern North American Freshwater Fishes, pp. 97-121. In: Simon, T.L. (ed.). Assessing the sustainability and biological integrity of water resources using fish communities. CRC Press. Boca Raton, Florida. 671 pp. Bigmouth buffalo are susceptible to anchor parasites which can lead to secondary infections which can be harmful in poor water conditions.Kleinholz, C.W. 2000. Species Profile: Bigmouth Buffalo. Southern Regional Aquaculture Center Publication Number 723.Another extremely old bigmouth buffalo with both black and orange spots. Both types of spotting accrue and intensify with age Life history At 112 years of age, the bigmouth buffalo is the oldest known freshwater teleost (a group of about 12,000 species) by nearly 40 years, shattering all previous records for this group. With a previous maximum longevity estimate for this species at 26 years, supercentenarian longevity came as a surprise and was initially met with skepticism. Thorough bomb radiocarbon dating was conducted on their otolith microstructure and confirmed the old age estimates generated from thin-sectioned otoliths, making bigmouth buffalo the oldest age-validated freshwater fish in the world. The bigmouth buffalo is a spring spawner generally spawning between April and June when the water temperature is between 13 and 26 ¬∞C. The bigmouth is a broadcaster that has adhesive eggs, which it lays in highly vegetated waters. Females seek highly submergent and emergent vegetation, which is ideal habitat for the hatching of their eggs. The substrate found is generally a mixture of a medium amount of rubble and gravel and a high amount of sand and silt.Lane, J.A., Portt, C.B. and Minns, C.K. 1996. Spawning habitat characteristics of Great Lake fishes. Canadian Manuscript Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Science 2368: v-48. The water levels substantially rise before spawning and stabilize afterwards. The sexual maturity of bigmouths is mostly unknown and likely varies with latitude. In southern Minnesota, females begin to mature once they are around 10 years old, while males around 6 years old. This is substantially older than previously assumed using inadequate aging techniques, indicating a much slower life pace than previously realized. Bigmouth buffalo have a tendency to accumulate unique pigmentation (orange and black spots) as they age. The bigmouths are group spawners which produce 250,000 eggs/kg of adult weight; their eggs are about 1.5 mm in diameter. Conservation status wanton waste pile of bigmouth buffalo shot by bow and arrow (bowfishing) Bigmouth buffalo's conservation status is in urgent need of reassessment. The bigmouth buffalo is an endangered fish species in Pennsylvania. Besides this state, the bigmouth buffalo is not currently listed as threatened or endangered in any other region of its native distribution, even though they have had Special Concern status in Canada since the 1980s, and have been known as declining in the northern extent of their US range since the 1970s. Surprisingly, several longstanding US populations are composed almost totally (85-90%) of individuals hatched before 1940, while harvest limits do not exist in these same areas - this despite the rapidly growing new sport of modernized night bowfishing that exploits this species. The fingerlings are susceptible to a parasite, Lernea cyprinacae, but most are unaffected by the time they reach a length of 30 mm. They are anchor parasites that insert themselves between scale margins and fin insertions. The real problem is a secondary infection that may arise due to these parasites, the protozoan Epistylis and bacteria Flavobacterium columnare are both attached to serious parasite infestations. The bigmouth has been seen to hybridize in the wild with smallmouth buffalo, and it is possible that some fish identified as black buffalo are indeed these hybrids.Johnson, D.W. and Minckley, W.L. 1969. Natural Hybridization in Buffalofishes, Genus Ictiobus. American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists 1969: 198-200. The hybridization does not seem to be negatively affecting their populations but makes it difficult to determine how many hybrids and how many black buffalo are actually in certain reservoirs. The fish is vulnerable in shallow water and is often captured by bow and arrow. It is commercially caught on trotlines, setlines, hoop and trammel nets, and seines. There are currently no found specific management plans for the bigmouth buffalo either privately or governmentally funded in the US. In some places like the southern US, progeny have been reared in hatcheries.  Records  On June 21, 2013, Noah LaBarge (13 years old) caught the Wisconsin state record bigmouth buffalo fish.http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/documents/recordfish/WisRecordFishAug2013.pdf It measured and weighed . It was caught on an 8-lb-test line on the Wisconsin River at Devil's Elbow, which is on the north end of the Petenwell Flowage. It was officially recognized to be the new world record by the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame as both 8-lb-line class and all tackle. A Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, a man caught a record bigmouth buffalo while fishing on Percy Priest Lake. The fish, caught by Jeff Wilkins in late March, was in length and snagged in the Seven Points area of the lake. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency said it took him 35 minutes to reel in the fish. The new record surpasses the previous mark of 52 pounds, 2 oz, previously held since April 6, 2001, by Greg Megibben. The giant fish also came from Percy Priest Lake. After the record was certified, Wilkins released the fish back into the lake. In Omaha, Nebraska, Joe Slavic caught a bigmouth buffalo on June 8, 2000, in a sand pit located in Dodge County.

A data library is normally part of a larger institution (academic, corporate, scientific, medical, governmental, etc.) established for research data archiving and to serve the data users of that organisation. The data library tends to house local data collections and provides access to them through various means (CD-/DVD-ROMs or central server for download). A data library may also maintain subscriptions to licensed data resources for its users to access the information. Whether a data library is also considered a data archive may depend on the extent of unique holdings in the collection, whether long-term preservation services are offered, and whether it serves a broader community (as national data archives do). Most public data libraries are listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories. Importance of data libraries and data librarianship In August 2001, the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) published SPEC Kit 263: Numeric Data Products and Services, presenting results from a survey of ARL member institutions involved in collecting and providing services for numeric data resources.

On his father's arrest and execution for high treason in 911, he and his wife, Regelinda, daughter of Count Eberhard I of Z√ºrich, went to Italy: either banished by Count Erchanger or voluntarily exiling themselves to their relatives over the Alps. Around 913, Burchard returned from exile and took control over his father's property. In 915, he joined Erchanger and Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, in battle at Wahlwies. Following the battle, Erchanger was proclaimed duke. After Erchanger was executed on 21 January 917, Burchard seized all his lands and was recognised universally as duke. In 919, King Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy seized the county of Z√ºrich and invaded the region of Konstanz, then the centre and practical capital of the Swabian duchy. At Winterthur, however, Rudolph was defeated by Burchard, who thus consolidated the duchy and forced on the king his own territorial claims. In that same year, he recognised the newly elected king of Germany, Henry the Fowler, duke of Saxony. Henry in turn gave Burchard rights of taxation and investiture of bishops and abbots in his duchy. In 922, Burchard married his daughter Bertha to Rudolph and affirmed the peace of three years prior. Burchard then accompanied Rudolph into Italy when he was elected king by opponents of the Emperor Berengar. In 924, the emperor died and Hugh of Arles was elected by his partisans to oppose Rudolph. Burchard attacked Novara, defended by the troops of Lambert, Archbishop of Milan. There he was killed, probably on 29 April. His widow, Regelinda (d. 958), remarried to Burchard's successor, Herman I. She had given him five children: *Gisela (c. 905 - 26 October 923 or 925), abbess of Waldkirch *Hicha (c. 905 - 950), whose son was Conrad, Duke of Lorraine *Burchard III (c. 915 - 11 November 973), later duke of Swabia *Bertha (c. 907 - 2 January 961), married Rudolph II, King of Burgundy *Adalric (d. 973), monk in Einsiedeln Abbey References Sources  * Category:Dukes of Swabia Category:10th-century rulers in Europe Category:880s births Category:926 deaths Category:Hunfridings ","title":"Burchard II, Duke of Swabia"},{"id":"4855682","text":"Example of a junction tree The junction tree algorithm (also known as 'Clique Tree') is a method used in machine learning to extract marginalization in general graphs. In essence, it entails performing belief propagation on a modified graph called a junction tree. The graph is called a tree because it branches into different sections of data; nodes of variables are the branches. The basic premise is to eliminate cycles by clustering them into single nodes. Multiple extensive classes of queries can be compiled at the same time into larger structures of data. There are different algorithms to meet specific needs and for what needs to be calculated. Inference algorithms gather new developments in the data and calculate it based on the new information provided. Junction tree algorithm =Hugin algorithm= * If the graph is directed then moralize it to make it un-directed. *Introduce the evidence. *Triangulate the graph to make it chordal. *Construct a junction tree from the triangulated graph (we will call the vertices of the junction tree \\"supernodes\\"). *Propagate the probabilities along the junction tree (via belief propagation) Note that this last step is inefficient for graphs of large treewidth. Computing the messages to pass between supernodes involves doing exact marginalization over the variables in both supernodes. Performing this algorithm for a graph with treewidth k will thus have at least one computation which takes time exponential in k. It is a message passing algorithm. The Hugin algorithm takes fewer computations to find a solution compared to Shafer-Shenoy. =Shafer-Shenoy algorithm= * Computed recursively * Multiple recursions of the Shafer-Shenoy algorithm results in Hugin algorithm * Found by the message passing equation *Separator potentials are not stored The Shafer-Shenoy algorithm is the sum product of a junction tree. It is used because it runs programs and queries more efficiently than the Hugin algorithm. The algorithm makes calculations for conditionals for belief functions possible. Joint distributions are needed to make local computations happen. =Underlying theory= Example of a Dynamic Bayesian network The first step concerns only Bayesian networks, and is a procedure to turn a directed graph into an undirected one. We do this because it allows for the universal applicability of the algorithm, regardless of direction. The second step is setting variables to their observed value. This is usually needed when we want to calculate conditional probabilities, so we fix the value of the random variables we condition on. Those variables are also said to be clamped to their particular value. Example of a chordal graph The third step is to ensure that graphs are made chordal if they aren't already chordal. This is the first essential step of the algorithm. It makes use of the following theorem: Theorem: For an undirected graph, G, the following properties are equivalent: * Graph G is triangulated. * The clique graph of G has a junction tree. * There is an elimination ordering for G that does not lead to any added edges. Thus, by triangulating a graph, we make sure that the corresponding junction tree exists. A usual way to do this, is to decide an elimination order for its nodes, and then run the Variable elimination algorithm. The variable elimination algorithm states that the algorithm must be run each time there is a different query. This will result to adding more edges to the initial graph, in such a way that the output will be a chordal graph. All chordal graphs have a junction tree. The next step is to construct the junction tree. To do so, we use the graph from the previous step, and form its corresponding clique graph. Now the next theorem gives us a way to find a junction tree: Theorem: Given a triangulated graph, weight the edges of the clique graph by their cardinality, A‚à©B, of the intersection of the adjacent cliques A and B. Then any maximum-weight spanning tree of the clique graph is a junction tree. So, to construct a junction tree we just have to extract a maximum weight spanning tree out of the clique graph. This can be efficiently done by, for example, modifying Kruskal's algorithm. The last step is to apply belief propagation to the obtained junction tree. Usage: A junction tree graph is used to visualize the probabilities of the problem. The tree can become a binary tree to form the actual building of the tree. A specific use could be found in auto encoders, which combine the graph and a passing network on a large scale automatically. = Inference Algorithms = Cutset conditioning Loopy belief propagation: A different method of interpreting complex graphs. The loopy belief propagation is used when an approximate solution is needed instead of the exact solution. It is an approximate inference. Cutset conditioning: Used with smaller sets of variables. Cutset conditioning allows for simpler graphs that are easier to read but are not exact. References  * *Lepar, V., Shenoy, P.

Early life Choudhury was born on 1 March 1929, in Mukimpur, Nabiganj, Habiganj District, Bangladesh (then part of Assam) where his father Azhar Choudhury, a land owner, and his mother Nazmun Nesa Choudhury, a house wife resided. Contributions In his contributions to Bengali literature, the writer and philosopher Choudhury depicted a transparent portrait of modern Bengali's life in abroad. He was a scholar of science, with great intellectual abilities and eloquent of both pen and speech. He had a remarkable openness to modern Western knowledge as well as Eastern knowledge. Choudhury made a lasting contribution to Bengali literature with his novels, travelogue, essays and his introspective autobiographical and epistolary works.Sharak 1, Dhaka, 1998. His novels and short stories were often set against an emergent urban background, but more commonly in cities outside Bangladesh such as London, Bedford, Calcutta, Karachi and Kohat; where the majority of immigrant Bengali resided. Choudhury created his characters from highly diverse backgrounds and developed themes that revolved around the twists and turns of events, the conflicts and contradictions prevailing in the social processes. His characters embraced a new change; death of an old social values which were based on the ideas of corruptions, religious, political, economical; and the rise of the self- freedom, birth of a new society, these immediately preceded the social processes of the present day and hence are vital to identifying and understanding contemporary problems.Jibani Granthamala: A Series of Literary biographies, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, Feb 1999. It is essential to analyses Choudhury's writings in the light of the social scenario from 60s-90s, when deprivation and degradation were taken for granted in Bangladesh, London and India-Pakistan which were known by some and unknown by others. These realities some times were dedicated and made indelible in the name of religious sermons and social sanctions. Thus his main task was to focus readers' attention, by giving a frame-by-frame picture of the helplessness and inhuman predicament of the victims of injustice.LIVING IN A FARAWAY LAND, Junaidul Haque, Dhaka, 2003. In Porodeshe Porobashi (Life on Distant Shores), Chowdhury has not only discovered London, where he stayed with fellow Sylhetis, but also discovered his own homeland. When you are far away, when you are detached from your object of love, your inner eye gets working and you discovery the truth. This discovery is ugly from a close look but is beautiful and lovable when seen from a distance. Most of us who stay in our homeland fail to take a close look at it. But the novelist succeeds in discovering his own land while staying overseas and thinking of it and loving it. Reality and nostalgia get mixed with each other to form a perfect image of the writer's homeland in his mind. Porodeshe Porobashi is a quality work of art by any standard. The writer is a powerful narrator and uses wit and humour quite deftly. He is a skilful user of words. The writer depends on autobiographical elements and has a philosophical outlook. He clearly understood the psyche of Bangladeshis staying abroad. He dips deep into the human mind, as he has written elsewhere about the book, the writer mixes reality with the light and shade of truth. Thus it is a true picture of common life. It is lively and hat at all dull, neither a travelogue nor a memoir, it is a novel with lively characters, a touching story of human suffering and a story of the eternal lonely man. The wide canvas of words and tales of this artist brought out the plight of women in the male-dominated set-up of society. Over and above the Islamic-based code of beliefs of the society; male-domination society pushed woman into complete subjugation, making them property for the use of men, because of such a 'life- style's set-up, economical and social oppression was principally faced by women. This drove women to utter frustration and desperation. Choudhury portrayed women, their plight, and their helplessness in the face of this male-dominated society. On the other hand, he wrote about their sense of humanitarian values, their love, sorrows, their deep longing for a life as normal and beautiful as free women. In the wake of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, which surged up all over Bangladesh, was recounted in his writing Ekti Jatike Hotay (Legacy of a Nation). Choudhury believed that in today's world men no longer wanted to keep themselves constricted within the sphere of a specified duty. In Choudhury's time, in a modern society with priest as its advocate and protector, religion lost all its progressivism. It went so far that religion became bogged down in rituals, superstitions and bigotry, while its proponents stank of greed, corruption, even debauchery: even the so-called mullahs could not keep themselves free from this downfall. Almost half the characters in his novels Sampan Crass (St. Pancras) and Aniketon represented the mainstay of the decadent society, while the other half, were absorbed with the emerging thoughts, ideals and values of the new society - humanist and secular in content.Sharak 2, Dhaka, 1998. Choudhury's most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) vol. 1, 2, 3. This is the largest novel of Choudhury. Based mainly on the political activities and the political leaders of Pakistan, of the Indian Subcontinent in board sense, the novel covers the span from 1968 to the Liberation War of Bangladesh (1971). The novel begins with no other character than that of Bhutto and gradually reveals his true nature. The readers will also get a vivid picture of greater \\"Undivided Bengal\\", changes in the social structure and the creation of a socialist state. The author's own experiences of tension, imagination and dreams combined together to produce a multi-faceted novel.The Daily Star, 8 July 2005. In Choudhury's short-stories the write portrays the changes of village life brought by the time. He is very much in love with his motherland, the rivers and paddy fields. He portrays the London life of people from Sylhet quite faithfully and in great detail. Researchers will find his works useful in the future. Choudhury handles a lot of characters and a wide range of time. Most of the writings are perfect picture of our society, and it has a lovely appearance also. In some of his short stories the writer gives a lot of importance to the physical state of human existence, society should get rid of its negative forces, and build strength on human body and its soul, both of which are deeply linked, and hence both are very important for human beings. He was an understanding revolutionary in his own right, ploughing alone a firm held furrow. He carried on his revolution through revealing revelations of all surviving social practices and norms. Unlike many others of his stature, Choudhury as a man, towers far above Choudhury as a writer, though he carved out a place for himself amongst the galaxy of contemporary novelists.

Maine Guides are individuals certified to accompany travelers on a number of outdoor activities in the wilderness of the State of Maine, in the United States. History On March 19, 1897, The Maine legislature passed a bill requiring hunting guides to register with the state. Maine registered 1316 guides in that first year. The first Registered Maine Guide was a woman, Cornilia Thurza Crosby, or \\"Fly Rod\\", as she was popularly known. In addition to being its first licensed guide, she promoted Maine's outdoor sports at shows in metropolitan areas, and wrote a popular column that appeared in many newspapers around the country. Her efforts helped to attract thousands of would-be outdoorsmen - and women - to the woods and streams of Maine. The tradition of women pioneering Maine guiding continued in 1976 when Suzie Hockmeyer, the \\"Queen of the Kennebec\\", became the first female whitewater rafting guide. What is a Maine Guide? Maine Guides are licensed and registered with the State of Maine.Maine Professional Guides AssociationGame and Fish NetworkMaine Association of Sea Kayak Guides and Instructors accompanying or assisting any person in the fields, forests, or on the waters or ice within the jurisdiction of the State while white water rafting, hunting, fishing, trapping, boating, snowmobiling or camping at a primitive camping area. Becoming a Maine Guide Maine Guides can be licensed in just one or any combination of specialized classifications including white water rafting, hunting, inland fishing, recreational, sea-kayaking, and tide water fishing. Being licensed in a specialized classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide specific activities: *Specialized White Water Rafting classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide commercial rafting passengers down the designated commercial raftable rivers in the State of Maine. White Water Guides are the only classification required to complete a set of training guidelines and have that training certified by a licensed commercial outfitter as specified by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife. There are 2 levels of license classification: Level I allows the guiding of the Kennebec, Dead, and lower half of the Penobscot River. Level II allows the guiding of all Maine Rivers. *Specialized Hunting classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide hunting and trapping, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with hunting and trapping. *Specialized Fishing classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide fishing, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with fishing on inland waters. *Specialized Recreational classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide boating, snowmobiling, and camping. *Specialized Sea-Kayaking classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide sea-kayaking on the State's territorial seas and tributaries of the State up to the head of tide and out to the three mile limit, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with sea-kayaking. *Specialized Tide-Water Fishing classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide sport fishing on the State's territorial seas and tributaries of the State up to the head of tide out to the three mile limit, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with tide-water fishing. To earn a specialized rating Registered Maine Guides must complete a written examination in each license classification. In addition all Maine Guides have passed an oral examination. The oral exam is overseen by a panel of State of Maine Game Wardens and experienced Maine Guides. The oral exam includes map and compass or navigation, lost person or catastrophic event scenarios, general navigation, survival, ethics, first aid, wildlife identification as well as questions to ensure the professional knowledge in the Guide's area of specialization. The process of obtaining a license as a Registered Maine Guide is one of the most difficult in the country due to the need to specifically know and prove woods knowledge, which is why Maine Guides are held in such high regards over other states. Master Maine Guide Master certification means that a person has acquired experience in a specialized classification that exceeds the minimum requirements necessary to be licensed as a guide in that classification. To become a Master Maine Guide, a guide must have been working as a guide for ten years and have had at least five years professional experience in their specialized classification.

A Commodore 64 port followed. The player takes the role of a spider in an apple cider factory. The goal is to progress through three screens to reach the top of the factory, to join the company of other spiders. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The structure of the three screens follows the production cycle of apple cider in a reverse order, starting from the bottling and sealing of cider and ending at the delivery of fresh whole apples. The first screen mainly concerns extracting the apple juice to be made into cider, the second screen concerns splitting the apples in two and crushing the halves, and the third screen concerns the actual import of the apples. Each screen is situated on top of the previous one, so the spider progresses upward while the apples are carried downward. The challenge in the game comes almost completely in the form of natural obstacles in the cider factory. Contact with cider, apples, or cider- making instruments kills the spider instantly. All three screens feature a complex system of conveyor belts that the spider must travel along, in the opposite direction to the cider and the apples. Various cider-making instruments operate periodically to make the apples into cider. The factory is oblivious to the presence of the spider. When the three screens have been completed, the game starts again, but with added dangers. These include various animals that hop along the platform as well as blocker bars on the ladders that the spider uses to move upwards.

The show is also notable for providing a start for several young stars, including Sarah Chalke, Devon Sawa, Erica Cerra, Jai West, Kea Wong and Taheer Mohamed. KidZone initially began as a series of informative skits and interviews. Following the education mandate of the broadcaster, the show managed to present anti-smoking, safety and environmental issues with funding from provincial government agencies and private companies. The entire cast of the show were children, who acted in various sketches and portrayed journalists. At the age of 12, Chalke was the program's environmental reporter. One of the recurring sketches on KidZone was Kerrisdale V6M 1Z6, which used a style similar to Beverly Hills, 90210 and Degrassi Junior High to present youth issues. Eventually, KidZone shifted away from its journalistic style and became a docudrama about high school based on the Kerrisdale sketch. This version of the show also aired in the United States as Kerrisdale High. At the end of its broadcast run in 2001, KidZone was rebranded as KidZone Live. Much like Degrassi Talks, the show featured KidZone actors participating in sketches and call-in discussions on topics oriented toward young viewers. Among the issues covered on KidZone Live were injury prevention, road safety and eliminating racial discrimination.

An Esquire Bedell is a junior ceremonial officer of a university, usually with official duties relating to the conduct of ceremonies for the conferment of degrees. The word is closely related to the archaic bedel and modern English beadle. History The University of Cambridge historically had a beadle (usher) assisting with official ceremonies as well as being an administrative assistant of the chancellor and the proctors. The title of Gentleman Bedell, similar in status to a Gentleman Usher, was in use by 1392. The title Esquire Bedell was first used in 1473 and formally recognised in the university statutes by Edward VI in 1549. The principal bedell was assisted in both administrative and ceremonial duties by a secondary or sub-bedell. By the 15th century this position was given the somewhat demeaning title of \\"inferior bedell\\", but granted the title of Yeoman Bedell by Edward VI in 1549. Yeomen at the time were often constables and bailiffs. A Yeoman Bedell performed similar duties at the university, including collecting fines at the time when universities had their own jurisdiction over students. The Yeoman Bedell could also perform the duties of a crier. By country Esquires Bedell are primarily associated with universities in the United Kingdom. In Australia, the Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, the University of Sydney, the University of New England, Monash University and others retain the position of Esquire Bedell, sometimes assisted by a Yeoman Bedell. These are largely administrative positions, although performing the traditional duties of a bedell for graduation ceremonies. In New Zealand, the University of Auckland has Esquires Bedell.

History Hanes was founded in 1900 by John Wesley Hanes at Winston, North Carolina under the name Shamrock Knitting Mills. He died in 1903. In 1911, Shamrock Knitting Mills built a new plant at 3rd and Marshall Streets; it was sold in 1926 and occupied by a Cadillac dealership after a larger plant was built on West 14th Street. Known as Shamrock Mills, the original building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Shamrock Knitting Mills was named Hanes Hosiery Mills Company in 1914. John Wesley Hanes' brother Pleasant H. Hanes founded the P.H. Hanes Knitting Company in 1901. The brothers previously operated a tobacco manufacturing business, that they sold to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1900. The P.H. Hanes Knitting Company merged with Hanes Hosiery in 1965. The P.H. Hanes Knitting Company complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. In 1965 the Hanes Corporation was formed from the consolidation of two Hanes companies: Hanes Knitting and Hanes Dye & Fishing. In 1979, the corporation became part of Consolidated Foods (later renamed Sara Lee). In September 2006, Sara Lee Corporation spun off its branded clothing Americas and Asia business as a separate company called Hanesbrands Inc., which designs, manufactures, sources and sells a broad range of clothing essentials. The company's portfolio of brands include Hanes (its largest brand), Champion (its second largest brand), Playtex (its third largest brand), Bali, Just My Size, Barely There, Wonderbra, L‚Äôeggs, C9 by Champion, Duofold, Beefy-T, Outer Banks, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Zorba and Ritmo. During the coronavirus pandemic in United States, Hanes is retrofitting its factory to manufacture N95 masks for healthcare workers.  Products  The Hanes brand is used by the company for marketing a variety of clothing: * Innerwear ** Women's underwear, such as bras, panties and bodywear ** Men's underwear and undershirts ** Kids‚Äô underwear and undershirts ** Socks ** Hosiery * Outerwear ** Activewear, such as performance T-shirts and shorts ** Casualwear, such as T-shirts, fleece and sport shirts Advertising During the 1970s and 1980s, their women's hosiery tagline was \\"Gentlemen Prefer Hanes\\". In the early 1990s, the slogan was turned around as \\"The lady prefers Hanes\\". From 1992 to 1999, the brand's main slogan was \\"Just wait'll we get our Hanes on you.\\" The slogan was revived in 2005, with celebrity endorsements including Michael Jordan, Damon Wayans, Matthew Perry and Marisa Tomei, as \\"Look who we've got our Hanes on now.\\" In 1996, Hanes was a major sponsor of the Atlanta Olympics. They produced a unique series of only 500 Beefy T-shirts; the first shirt was auctioned for $32,500, the highest price paid for a shirt was $42,000. In the 2000s, an ad campaign began for their Hanes \\"Go Tagless\\" T-shirt, featuring various celebrities including Jordan, Phillip Brooke, Big Ben Kennedy, Jackie Chan, and Brian Regan. As of July 2008, Charlie Sheen joined Jordan as the next Hanes celebrity spokesman. The commercials (along with the previous Cuba Gooding, Jr. commercials) were created by writer Brett Baker and Art Director David McKay of The Martin Agency in Richmond, Virginia. Hanesbrands has ended its advertising campaign featuring Sheen because of domestic violence charges filed against the actor in 2010. In 2019, the company introduced body positive messaging with the \\"Every Bod\\" campaign for their FlexFit boxers, aimed to reduce the macho image associated with men's underwear.

It was developed by Cross and released in 2000. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kow Otani, who also composed the music for Shadow of the Colossus, a variety of Gamera films, and various anime. The game follows an Indiana Jones-style storyline in which the player character flies through several areas of a fictional world, collecting artifacts as well as pieces of a map. The adventure mode of the game focuses on reaching the hidden tower of Maximus, which is located on one of four uncharted islands which are explored in the game. Gameplay The player in the game is given control of 10 different aircraft, 7 of which must be unlocked. These range from real world aircraft (such as the Fairey Swordfish), to prototypes that never saw actual flight (e.g. the Ky≈´sh≈´ J7W), to completely fictional ones. While a few of these are military aircraft, no combat actually takes place in the game. Instead players are given the task of flying complex missions to search for the map pieces needed to find the Tower of Maximus. Most missions involve traversing from one point on the games map to the next, but rarely is this straight forward. The missions often follow a path that requires flight through extreme terrain such as canyons, caves, and mountain peaks. To further complicate things, rogue weather patterns, rock slides, and other natural phenomena will constantly impede on progress into these areas and will often threaten to destroy the player's aircraft. In addition, several of the game's levels require certain tasks to be completed to advance. Examples of these include mid air refueling with a moving train, or attempting a fuel dump in order to cross a high mountain pass. After the mission is complete, players are given a score ranging from A+ to D and can buy new parts to customize their aircraft. Higher scores lead to more parts being made available for purchase. In addition to the main adventure there are two bonus modes called Target Mode and Sky Canvas Mode. In Target Mode players must take off and navigate through a series of targets in the shortest amount of time as possible and return to the runway for landing. Sky Canvas Mode requires players to Skywrite different words and symbols before the smoke can be blown away by the wind. There is also a training mode and a Free Flight mode. Training mode introduces players to the controls of the game while Free Flight mode lets players freely fly their unlocked aircraft without the restrictions or dangers found in the main part of the game. Reception Sky Odyssey was well received by the game critics. It has achieved an average score of 78% from GameRankings, a reviews aggregate.http://www.gamerankings.com/ps2/429819-sky-odyssey/index.html IGN gave the game a favorable score of 9 out of 10 stating that Sky Odyssey is a game \\"that belongs in the software library of every PlayStation 2 owner.\\" It also said that while some may be turned off by the game's lack of violence, \\"the intensity and adrenaline levels that players will reach while playing this game really surpass what you'll ever likely get in a straight action game.\\"http://ps2.ign.com/articles/165/165346p1.html In an IGN list of top 10 most underrated games Sky Odyssey came in at number 6 on the list.http://wii.ign.com/articles/759/759799p1.html GameSpot gave the game an 8.3, praising it for its wide variety of aircraft and missions. GameSpot also liked the weather effects and physics in the game.http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/sim/skyodyssey/review.html Both sides however noted that the game's graphics were not up to par, and stated that the game was somewhat difficult for newcomers. GameVortex, however, stated that the training modes in the game provide enough help to newcomers.http://www.gamevortex.com/gamevortex/rm_ps2_skyodyssey.html IGN praised the game's soundtrack, while GameVortex stated the different variety of gameplay made the game enjoyable. Kevin Rice reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Sky Odyssey is one of those peculiar games that will have half the people loving it and the other half wondering what the commotion is. It's definitely good, but it won't suit everyone's taste.\\" Not all reviews were positive however. The Official PlayStation Magazine gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, while GamePro gave it 2.5 stars on the same scale.http://www.gamerankings.com/ps2/429819-sky-odyssey/articles.html IGN and Game spot noted that the game is not for everyone, especially those expecting a \\"straight up action game.\\" Still, GameSpot said in the closing of their review that, \\"those that are willing to overlook the game's graphical imperfections and can grapple with its relatively steep learning curve will be rewarded with a fully satisfying game experience.\\" Notes and references External links *Official website * Category:2000 video games Category:Activision games Category:CAProduction games Category:Flight simulation video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Single-player video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Kow Otani Category:Cancelled Dreamcast games ","title":"Sky Odyssey"},{"id":"4855868","text":"Favre Lake is a glacial tarn in the Ruby Mountains of Elko County, Nevada, United States.

Description It is distinguished from the porcupinefish by the shorter, less sharply pointed, and immovable spines which cover the somewhat spherical body. It can inflate its body by taking either air or water into a ventral extension of the stomach. Its color is olivaceous or brownish above and pale yellow below. The back and sides are irregularly striped with brownish, dusky, or black lines which are parallel to each other and which run obliquely downward. There are several large black spots on the sides, one just below the dorsal fin, and another behind the pectoral fin. Its maximum size is about 10 inches. Distribution It is found mostly in the tropics of the western Atlantic Ocean from Brazil to Florida as well as along the Atlantic coast of North America, sometimes as far north as Cape Cod and regularly during the late summer and fall in the vicinity of New York. One has been reported caught on dead shrimp as far as Oyster Lake, near Matagorda Bay, Tx. Habitat It spawns off New Jersey in July. Juveniles are also found in the Chesapeake Bay in the summertime. Diet It feeds on invertebrates such as oysters, barnacles, mussels, small crabs, and hermit crabs. Fishing technique It has no commercial value but is occasionally taken by fishermen and stuffed as curio. Some end up in the aquarium pet trade. It occasionally is killed in gill nets and then tossed back by the fishermen. It is often washed ashore along the beach and is a treacherous object if stepped on by mistake with bare feet. Other species of burr and porcupinefish are found in the tropics. References * E. C.

Common names Common names used in South America for this species include bejuca lora, bejuquilla verde, cipo, and cobra bicuda.Freiberg, M. 1982. Snakes of South America. T.F.H. Publications. Hong Kong. 189 pp. . (Oxybelis fulgidus, pp. 104, 137 + photographs on pp. 134-135.) Geographic range It is found in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Description This snake is very slender, roughly thick, and may attain a total length of about . The tail is long and very delicate, but mostly used to hold on while reaching for prey. The head is aerodynamically shaped and very pointy, the mouth is very large and extends almost the whole length of the head. The tongue is long and green; when in use it is kept outside the mouth and moved up and down. this behavior is reflected in other species of vine snake and it is believed that they are using their tongues as sights the way a cat uses its whiskers, as they move very quickly through branches and brush. It is bright green dorsally, and yellowish green ventrally and on the upper lip. There is a narrow yellowish- white stripe along each side of the belly and tail. Snout very prominent, about three times as long as the diameter of the eye. No loreal, prefrontal contacting 2 or 3 upper labials. 9-10 upper labials, 4th, 5th, and 6th (or 5th, 6th, and 7th) entering the eye. Temporals very large, 1 + 2. Dorsal scales weakly keeled, arranged in 17 rows at midbody. Ventrals 198-217; anal plate divided; subcaudals 139-165, also divided. Catching prey The green vine snake stays high on trees and looks down to the ground. When a mouse, lizard or nest is found, the snake follows the prey a short distance and smells it carefully. If the snake is content with it, it bites into the head and lifts the prey from the ground. With this the snake prevents the prey from using its physical strength. The vine snake has two larger upper teeth at the back of its mouth; these teeth permit the toxic saliva to penetrate the wounds and to immobilize the prey. Then it is rapidly swallowed. Once the prey is completely in the snake's body, the vine snake searches for a resting place, usually in the highest point of a tree. The venom of Oxybelis fulgidus is fast acting on small animals, but has little or no effect on humans. Envenomation of human beings is rare as the rear fangs require the snake to grab and chew to get its venom in, something most people will not stand for. In the rare instance of human envenomation, slight tingling to temporary numbness at the site of the bite is reported. As with all venomous creatures, serious allergic reactions are possible so caution should still be taken when handling these snakes. Behavior in captivity Vine snakes must be kept in large terrariums with a height of at least and a surface of . The behavior towards humans is neutral and the snake usually goes to the other end of the terrarium. Some adapt very well and even come closer. Unlike their Asian look-alikes, these snakes will readily take mice and some are even large enough to eat rats. This fact makes them a prized choice among reptile collectors. Captive life spans are estimated at 9‚Äì15 years.

Although generally classified as a non-crocodylian crocodylomorph, it is sometimes placed as one of the earliest true crocodylians. Allodaposuchus is one of the most common Late Cretaceous crocodylomorphs from Europe, with fossils known from Spain, Romania, and France.  Description  Restoration of A. precedens Like many other Cretaceous crocodylomorphs, Allodaposuchus has a relatively small body size compared to living crocodylians. The largest known specimen of Allodaposuchus belongs to an individual that was probably around long.Pu√©rtolas et al., 2014, p.93 Although the shape varies between species, in general Allodaposuchus has a short, flattened, and rounded skull. Allodaposuchus precedens has a brevirostrine or \\"short-snouted\\" skull with a snout about the same length as the skull table (the region of the skull behind the eye sockets) and A. subjuniperus has a mesorostrine or \\"middle-snouted\\" skull with a snout that is longer than the skull table.Martin, 2010 The main feature that distinguishes Allodaposuchus species from other related crocodylomorphs is the orientation of a groove at the back of the skull called the cranioquadrate passage; unlike the cranioquadrate passages of other crocodylomorphs, which are only visible at the back of the skull, the cranioquadrate passage of Allodaposuchus is visible when the skull is viewed from the side.Delfino et al., 2008 At least one species of Allodaposuchus, A. hulki, may have adaptations that would have allowed it to live on land for extended periods of time. A. hulki has large sinuses in its skull that are not seen in any other crocodylian living or extinct and may have aided it in hearing out of water, as well as lightening the skull. Moreover, A. hulki has well-developed muscle attachments on its scapula, humerus, and ulna bones that would have allowed the forelimbs to have been held in a semi-erect stance suitable for walking over land. Remains of A. hulki come from interbedded sandstones and marls that, based on the presence of charophyte algae, likely formed in ephemeral ponds in a large floodplain far from permanent bodies of water like lakes or rivers. A. hulki may therefore have spent much of its time out of water, travelling between these ponds for food.Blanco et al., 2015, p.10  History of study  There are four described species Allodaposuchus. The type species of Allodaposuchus, A. precedens, was named by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa in 1928 from VƒÉlioara, Romania.Nopcsa, 1928 Nopcsa found bone fragments in a deposit of the Ha»õeg Basin that dates back to the late Maastrichtian stage ‚Äì the very end of the Late Cretaceous. Several partial skulls from Spain and France were attributed to A. precedens in 2001.Buscalioni et al., 2001 Some of these skulls came from Campanian-age deposits slightly older than those in Romania, meaning that the species must have persisted for about 5 million years. In 2013 a second species of Allodaposuchus, A. subjuniperus, was named on the basis of a skull from the late-Maastrichtian Conqu√®s Formation, part of the Tremp Group, in the province of Huesca, Spain. The skull was found underneath a juniper tree whose roots had grown between the bones, hence the species name subjuniperus or \\"under juniper\\" in Latin. The 2013 study also proposed that the French and Spanish fossils assigned to A. precedens in 2001 might actually represent a new unnamed species of Allodaposuchus currently identified as Allodaposuchus sp. A study published in 2005 had suggested that these fossils belong to several different genera of crocodylomorphs and that the original Romanian material is too fragmentary to assign to its own genus, making Allodaposuchus a nomen dubium or \\"dubious name\\".Martin & Buffetaut, 2005 However, the 2013 study reaffirmed the Romanian material's distinctiveness from other European Cretaceous crocodylomorphs and therefore reaffirmed the validity of Allodaposuchus as a genus. In 2014, A. palustris was described from a partial skull and other skeletal fragments found in Maastrichtian age sediments of the Tremp Formation in a fossil locality called Fumanya Sud in the southern Pyrenees.Blanco et al., 2014, p.7 These remains allowed for the first detailed description of the postcranial (non-skull) anatomy of Allodaposuchus. A fourth species of Allodaposuchus, A. hulki, was named in 2015 and also came from the Tremp Formation, although this time in a locality called Casa Fab√†. The species is named after the Hulk from Marvel Comics, in reference to features on the bones that suggest it had strong muscles.  Relationships  jaw fragments and teeth of A. palustris Skeletal diagram showing known remains of A. palustris Allodaposuchus is one of the earliest members of the Crocodylia clade, the most exclusive group including all modern crocodylians. The ancestors of Allodaposuchus and other crocodylians were part of a larger evolutionary group called Eusuchia that originated in the Early Cretaceous. Allodaposuchus is part of an evolutionary radiation of eusuchians that happened later in the Cretaceous as they spread to multiple continents. When Franz Nopcsa named Allodaposuchus, he proposed that it was a close relative of Leidyosuchus, a crocodylian from Canada. However, Nopsca could only base this assignment on a few fragments of bone. After more complete material was uncovered from Spain and France, Allodaposuchus was reinterpreted as a non- crocodylian eusuchian in 2001. The 2001 study recognized a close relationship between Allodaposuchus and Hylaeochampsa, a eusuchian from the Early Cretaceous of England. A 2010 phylogenetic analysis supported a relationship similar to Nopsca's by placing Allodaposuchus within Alligatoroidea, a group of crocodylians that includes modern-day alligators and Leidyosuchus. The most recent phylogenetic analyses of Allodaposuchus ‚Äì published alongside the descriptions of A. palustris in 2014 and A. hulki in 2015 ‚Äì place it within Crocodylia but outside Alligatoroidea as a sister taxon (closest relative) of the clade Brevirostres, which includes Alligatoroidea and Crocodyloidea, the group including crocodiles and their closest extinct relatives. According to these studies Allodaposuchus is more closely related to Alligatoroidea and Crocodyloidea than it is to the third major group of living crocodylians, Gavialoidea, which includes modern gharials. Among extinct groups, Allodaposuchus is most closely related to the genus Borealosuchus, which existed in North America from the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene, and the family Planocraniidae, which existed in North America, Europe, and Asia from the Paleocene to the Eocene. The 2015 analysis also indicated a close relationship between Allodaposuchus species and a genus called Arenysuchus, regarded as a crocodyloid in earlier analyses. Like Al. palustris and Al. hulki, Arenysuchus comes from the Tremp Formation of Spain, although from a different locality called El√≠as. Arenysuchus fell within the Allodaposuchus clade, being more closely related to A. hulki and A. precedens than is A. palustris, raising the possibility that Allodaposuchus is a polyphyletic taxon (i.e., not a true clade) . The authors of the analysis proposed the name Allodaposuchia for the clade containing Arenysuchus and Allodaposuchus species.

L. Marshall, Ivor Allchurch, Len White, John McGuigan and Liam Tuohy. Leonard Roy White (23 March 1930 ‚Äì 17 June 1994) was an English professional footballer who played as a centre-forward, most noted for playing at Newcastle United. He is Newcastle United's third highest goalscorer of all-time. Biography Born in Skellow, West Riding of Yorkshire, a small village near Doncaster, White started his career at Upton Colliery before moving to Rotherham United and progressing through the Millers youth and reserve teams. Although originally a centre forward, he developed his skills as a winger too. It was in the latter position that he made his league debut, scoring in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Wrexham in August 1950. He scored six goals in his first six first-team games. With winger Jack Grainger already established in the Millers team, White's appearances were limited, but in 1952 an injury to centre forward Jack Shaw, led to Grainger being switched to the central striker role, and White again playing as a winger. He was in great form and was selected for the FA national team in fixtures against the Army and the RAF. Those FA representative games brought him to the attention of the First Division clubs and he joined Newcastle United in 1953 for ¬£12,500 - a relatively high amount at the time. The signing of White came following two recent FA Cup successes for Newcastle. (Reference - \\"Millmoor Personalities\\", David Watson,Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, 1986) At Newcastle, White was primarily partnered up front alongside the well-established Jackie Milburn during the 1950s. Because of this, White often found himself in the shadows. Despite that, he had an impressive goalscoring tally and was instrumental during Newcastle's FA Cup-winning campaign of 1955. Once Milburn ended his career in the late 1950s, White took over as the leading striker, and continued to improve his ratio of goals. He eventually left the club for Huddersfield Town in 1962. White is currently the third highest goalscorer in history of Newcastle United with 153 goals. He is behind Jackie Milburn with 200 goals and Alan Shearer with 206 goals. White died in Huddersfield in June 1994. Len White's brother Jack White was also a professional footballer playing centre half for Aldershot and Bristol City before managing non league Cambridge City and Wellington Town.

Frere-Jones left the Times in 2016.https://www.latimes.com/staff/sasha-frere-jones Personal life He was born Alexander Roger Wallace Jones on January 31, 1967, in Manhattan, the elder child of Elizabeth Frere and Robin C. Jones. His younger brother, Tobias Frere-Jones, is founder of the typeface design company Frere-Jones Typography, and is on the faculty of the Yale School of Art. Tobias and Alexander both legally changed their surnames from Jones to Frere-Jones in 1981. He is a grandson of Alexander Stuart Frere, the former chairman of the board of William Heinemann Ltd, the British publishing house, and a great-grandson of the novelist Edgar Wallace, who wrote many popular pulp novels, though he is best known for writing the story for the film King Kong. (Merian C. Cooper wrote the screenplay.) In 1983, Frere-Jones played Capulet in a St. Ann's production of Romeo and Juliet directed by Nancy Fales Garrett. Mia Sara played Juliet. In 1984, Frere-Jones's We Three Kings was one of ten plays chosen for the Young Playwrights Festival. The original reading starred John Pankow and ≈Ωeljko Ivanek. The final production at the Public Theater starred Adam Klugman, Jack Klugman's son. His follow-up play, Jump Down Turn Around, was performed at St. Ann's and starred Frere-Jones and actor Josh Hamilton. In 1994, he married lawyer Deborah Holmes, with whom he has two sons. They divorced in 2006. Education Frere-Jones attended the Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn from 1972 to 1984. He won an award from the Young Playwrights Festival in 1983 for his play ‚ÄúWe Three Kings.‚Äù After graduating from St. Ann's in 1984, Frere-Jones attended Brown University for three years but did not graduate. He subsequently attended the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, concentrating on Dramatic Writing, then transferred to Columbia University in 1991. He graduated from the Columbia School of General Studies with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology in 1993. Music Frere-Jones plays bass, guitar, and various electronics. He founded the band Dolores during his time at Brown. The band made two full-length tapes: one in 1987 and one in 1990. After moving to New York in 1988, the band played for two years before breaking up. (Their only recordings during this period were two contributions to a compilation on Fang Records called Live At The Knitting Factory.) In 1990, Frere-Jones co- founded the instrumental, two-bass rhythm band Ui with Clem Waldmann. They played their first live show in 1991, and spent the following eight years touring across the United States and Europe, opening for bands like Stereolab and Tortoise. Career Frere-Jones debuted as The New Yorker's pop critic on March 8, 2004 with \\"Let's Go Swimming\\", an essay on Arthur Russell. He followed in the footsteps of the magazine's past critics Ellen Willis, Mark Moses, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Nick Hornby. He has covered independent acts like Arcade Fire, Joanna Newsom, Grizzly Bear, Manu Chao, and Bon Iver, as well as mainstream successes like Neil Diamond, Mariah Carey, Wu-Tang Clan, Lil Wayne, and Prince. Three essays originally published in the magazine have appeared in Da Capo Press's Best Music Writing anthologies. On October 22, 2007, The New Yorker published ‚ÄúA Paler Shade of White\\", an essay in which Frere-Jones examined the changing role of race in pop, specifically indie rock and hip-hop of the last two decades. In the piece Frere-Jones charges indie with being too white and therefore not sounding black enough and hip hop for being too black. The piece was roundly criticized by numerous pop music critics for Frere-Jone's seeming lack of knowledge regarding pop and rock music history, and controversial understanding of race in relation to music. proved to be controversial, eliciting responses from Playboy, The Village Voice, Slate, and Simon Reynolds, among dozens of other news outlets and blogs. The Stereogum music blog declared the controversy a 'war' between music writers. The New Yorker received more mail about \\"A Paler Shade of White\\" than it did for any other essay since \\"Escaping Picasso\\", Adam Gopnik's December 16, 1996 essay about Pablo Picasso. Frere-Jones published follow-ups to his article to address some of the criticism and where he is cited as writing: \\"...and also says that when he called Michael Jackson and Hall and Oates ‚Äúequally gifted,‚Äù it was not a typo.\\" In 2008, Frere-Jones was named one of the top 30 critics in the world by Intelligent Life, the lifestyle publication from The Economist. Frere-Jones also appears in the 2009 documentary Strange Powers by Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara, about Stephin Merritt and his band, The Magnetic Fields, in which he further discusses his ideas of race in pop music. On March 9, 2009, The New Yorker published his first profile, of British pop singer Lily Allen. At the end of 2009, he helped bring mainstream attention to then-unsigned indie rock band Sleigh Bells when he wrote that, \\"After shows at Le Poisson Rouge and Public Assembly, I knew they were my favorite band in New York.\\" In an ‚ÄúAsk the Author‚Äù feature on The New Yorker's Web site, Frere- Jones revealed he was working on a collection of pieces that would include an extended version of ‚ÄúPaler‚Äù that would expound upon his thesis and address responses to the original piece. Questions for Sasha Frere-Jones Frere-Jones is completing a short book on Michael Jackson due for publication in 2010 by Ecco Press.

The game goes on through the night, and Tony falls asleep on the bed. When Tony wakes in the morning Davey is down $45,000. Richie comes to the room, sees Davey playing and chokes him, breaking up the game. For this act of disrespect, Tony tells Richie that he is not permitted to collect his debt from Davey until Tony has collected his. Janice tells Richie he has a right to stand up to Tony. Tony is told by Uncle Junior that he and Tony's father had another brother, Ercole, long dead, who was, in Junior's words, \\"slow\\". He also tells him that his father left a \\"package\\" of money to his mother. Tony is uncomfortable when he sees his mother at a funeral and later at the high-school cabaret night. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is angry with everybody, but doesn't know why; he wants to hit her, and the happy-looking people he sees in the street. He despises the weaklings who run to psychiatrists and tells her, as he has told her before, that he admires the strong, silent type, like Gary Cooper. When Davey does not meet the first deadline for payment, Tony goes to his office at the store and beats him. Davey finds a pretext to take Eric's SUV away from him and gives it to Tony as partial payment. Tony presents it to Meadow, but she realizes it was Eric's car and tearfully rejects it. At the cabaret night, Eric refuses at the last minute to perform with her and walks out, leaving Meadow to perform a solo as she had always hoped. First appearances * Vito Spatafore: Richie Aprile's nephew, who is also in his crew. * David Scatino: Tony's childhood friend and compulsive gambler. * Dr. Ira Fried: A player in the Executive Game and doctor specialized in treating erectile dysfunction.

The provision of air traffic control services without the use of radar is called procedural control. Separation In air traffic control, the risk of aircraft colliding is managed by applying separation rules. These rules require aircraft to be separated by either a minimum vertical distance, or, if for some reason they cannot be separated vertically, by a minimum horizontal distance defined by various means. One of the means of determining horizontal separation is by a controller observing the radar returns of the aircraft to be at least a minimum horizontal distance apart. This is the essence of radar control, and is known as Radar separation. Standard radar separation varies from airspace to airspace and country to country, however 3 nms in terminal airspace and 5 nms in en route airspace are common minima. Maintaining separation In airspace with a lower amount of traffic, controllers will require pilots to navigate their aircraft on published routes which have been designed to be separated from each other. Controllers may require pilots to fly their aircraft at certain speeds or with certain minimum or maximum speeds to maintain separation between aircraft on these routes. When the amount of traffic in a particular volume of airspace reaches a certain level, it becomes impossible to keep aircraft following set routes separated, particularly in airspace where aircraft are climbing and descending (and therefore level separation regularly cannot be maintained). In this case controllers use \\"radar vectors\\", the issuing of headings to the pilots of aircraft on which the controller expects the pilots to fly their aircraft, to tactically keep aircraft separated in the sky. Much skill is involved in this type of control: it is this type of controlling that has led air traffic control to be described as \\"3D chess\\".

The lips have a bite plate in the back; when the plate is held between the teeth, the wax lips cover the wearer's own lips, to comic effect. Invented by the American Candy Company in the early 20th century, they became a popular novelty in the United States for many decades, especially during the Halloween season. Their popularity among children can be attributed mainly to the comedy of wearing the lips. Although they were intended to be used as a sort of chewing gum after the novelty of the gag wore off, the lips were often simply discarded rather than eaten. The original design of wax lips is proprietary. The patent was obtained by Concord Confections, Ltd. in 2002, and that company was in turn acquired by Tootsie Roll Industries in 2004. The lips are now produced under the Wack-O-Wax brand name. Other designs include the wax fangs design, which depicts open lips with a mouthful of bloody vampire teeth, black wax moustaches, and lips with protruding buck teeth.

Formerly known as Dartford County School, the school opened in 1904. It is the sister school of Dartford Grammar School for Boys. History =Early history= The Dartford County School opened unofficially on 3 October 1904 at a building on Essex Road. The school aimed to provide post- elementary education and to produce additional teachers to teach in new schools. The 75 students were girls aged 8‚Äì18; those under 13 were charged six guineas per term, while those 13 and older paid eight guineas per term. The official opening took place on 31 October 1904. During the first term, Amy Brett served as headmistress, overseeing two full-time staff and part-time visiting masters for Art and Singing. By 1906 enrolment had increased to 113, and two hutted classrooms were built to accommodate the increasing numbers. The faculty had grown to five full-time staff, who taught English language and English literature, Latin, drawing and science, and physical education. In September 1906 the first hockey team was formed. In 1909, the first school magazine was written. In 1910 there were eight forms and 11 staff. Because of the rapid expansion of the school, school trustees purchased of land on Shepherds Lane and built a new structure, which cost ¬£8,335. Rather than use the more popular and less expensive red brick favoured by many schools of the time, the school chose to clad the building in Kentish ragstone. The building included an assembly hall (now the canteen), a library, science laboratories, a dining room, and accommodation for the staff. It opened on 31 October 1912. On 27 June 1913, the school participated in the annual inter-county school sports events for the first time. The following year a compulsory uniform was introduced for students, consisting of a red, green and white tie, cream blouses with Peter Pan collars and for summer a lighter cotton tunic. Hair had to be drawn back and tied with a black ribbon at the top of the head. Blue overalls were worn for science, and white for cookery. By 1924 the school's student numbers had increased to 300. The building was expanded, adding five classrooms, a botany laboratory, a geography room, and a cloakroom. The assembly hall was enlarged and temporary huts were placed in the school grounds as dining facilities, which remained until 1937. A scholarship endowment fund was established in 1925 to assist students continuing into higher education. By 1926 the school was listed as one of the top three secondary schools for girls in Kent, along with Bromley High School and Chatham Grammar School. By 1930 the number of pupils had risen to 400. Four years later, Erith Grammar School became an all-boys school and their 73 female students were sent to Dartford County School. Construction began in January 1937 for a new wing. New classrooms were completed by September 1937, and the new hall was finished the following year to replace the huts which had served as canteen and kitchen, though it was not officially opened until 1939. In the late 1930s 50% of the students were fee-paying, while the others attended for free. The cost at this time was ¬£4 per term. School legend states that during the Second World War teachers would sit on the top of the school buildings to watch for enemy aircraft. If something were spotted then the girls would go to the air raid shelter where lessons were taken and meals were eaten. Between 1939 and 1947, three bombs fell on the school, and between 1940 and 1942 40 girls and two teachers were evacuated to a small village near Exeter. =Butler Act= In 1944 the school was shaken by one of the first Doodlebugs, leading to the school examinations being cancelled. In the same year, the Butler Education Act abolished fees and introduced new admission agreements. The school was renamed in this year as Dartford County Grammar School for Girls. In 1951 all staff were female and the number of pupils was to 730. In 1956, the school became the only school in the North West division that was legally entitled to bear a coat of arms. During 1958‚Äì1959, two additional classrooms and a craft room were added. The uniform was also adjusted to require all girls to change into indoor shoes upon arrival, wear a beret, and the wearing of 60-denier lisle stockings. In 1972 construction began on Dartford West Secondary Girls School. The new school was built on the playing fields of the old one, leaving Dartford County with only one hockey pitch. Male staff were re-introduced in the 1970s. During that decade, the wearing of hats was abolished, as well as the requirement to change into indoor shoes. The uniform was also changed to its current bottle green colour. An open-air swimming pool was built in 1975. A new headmistress, J. Hadman, took office in 1986. She renamed the houses and class groups, and introduced a new uniform. By 1989 the school had control of its own budget. =Grant- maintained status and foundation school= In 1991, the school ceased to be part of Kent Local Education Authority (LEA), and the following year became a grant-maintained school. In 1994, a new technology block opened and a two- storey temporary mobile was purchased to house the humanities department. In 1995, students at the school were among the first students nationwide to sit GCSEs covering the whole range of the UK's first National Curriculum. A 1997 OFSTED report described the school's curriculum as \\"unique\\" and the school environment as \\"stimulating and exciting\\". In 1998 another extension was completed, adding two science blocks, an IT/graphics room, an English suite, and two general classrooms. In 1999, the school was awarded \\"investor in people status\\". In January 2001 a new headteacher, Jane Wheatley, was appointed. The school was awarded Beacon school status in September 2001 and the school achievement award in April. In 2003, the school became the first specialist science school in Kent. In 2004, the school's centenary year, it was awarded the Artsmark Gold award. In September 2008 the school was re- accredited as a science specialist school. It was recognised as a high achieving school and awarded a second specialism in mathematics and computing. In 2009, Wheatley was appointed Executive Headteacher of both DGGS and Wilmington Enterprise College, and Sharon Pritchard was made responsible for the daily running of the school. On 31 August 2011, Wheatley stepped down and Pritchard took over as Headteacher. =Headteachers= *Amy Acworth (n√©e Brett): 1904‚Äì1928 *Edith M Freyer: began 1928 *Miss Janes (Miss James taught Botany) 1949‚Äì1971 *M.

The school is a specialist science school and has a second specialism in Maths and Computing. The school also received the ArtsMark Gold Award recognising its expertise in arts subjects. The school day consists of five one-hour lessons each day. DGGS is one of Dartford's top performing state schools. In 2009 all students achieved A*-C grades in their GCSEs and the school was placed 11th in the county for A Level results. Extra-curricular activities The school organises study visits and exchanges to countries including Cambodia, China, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. There are also several extra-curricular clubs available for students, separated into creativity, action, and service: *Creativity includes dance clubs, an art club, a drama club, school plays and concerts, debating society, a school magazine committee, Japanese Cultural Studies, Learn another Language, and a film club, as well as musical groups such as a school choir and senior chamber choir, chamber orchestra, jazz band, wind ensemble, and ukulele club. *Action includes sports team practices, inter-house matches, swimming, trampolining, circuit training, rowing, running club, weights, badminton, netball, and tennis, as well as the Duke of Edinburgh Award. *Service includes a Christian Union, the yearbook committee, Environmental Action Team, a librarian group, Key Stage Councils, and the School Council.

The specific epithet inermis is Latin for \\"unarmed\\" and refers to the upper pitchers of this species, which are unique in that they completely lack a peristome. Botanical history Nepenthes inermis was first collected on September 7, 1918, by H. A. B. B√ºnnemeijer on Mount Talang, at an altitude of above sea level. Two further collections were made by B√ºnnemeijer on Bukit Gombak on November 16, 1918, at and A fourth specimen was taken on April 26, 1920, from an elevation of on Mount Kerintji. This final specimen, B√ºnnemeijer 9695, was later designated as the lectotype of N. inermis by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. Illustration of three of B√ºnnemeijer's original herbarium specimens of N. inermis Nepenthes inermis was first illustrated in an issue of De Tropische Natuur published in 1927.Danser, B.H. 1927. Indische bekerplanten. De Tropische Natuur 16: 197‚Äì205. A year later, B. H. Danser formally described N. inermis in his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\". He wrote: \\"This new species is easily distinguishable from all others by the peculiar pitchers without peristome and with very narrow lid. Probably it is most nearly related to N. Bongso.\\" Several of the specimens collected by B√ºnnemeijer were labeled with the local vernacular names galoe-galoe antoe and kandjong baroek. Danser noted that these originate from the Minangkabau language and are also used to refer to other species, but stated that their meaning was not clear to him. In 1986, Mitsuru Hotta and Rusjdi Tamin included plant material belonging to N. dubia and N. inermis in their description of N. bongso.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In a 1993 study of Nepenthes prey and pitcher infauna,Kato, M., M. Hotta, R. Tamin & T. Itino 1993.

Kato and T. Itino, identified N. inermis from Mount Gadut as N. bongso. Despite this taxonomic confusion, N. bongso differs considerably in pitcher morphology from N. inermis and is not easily confused with it. Description Nepenthes inermis is a climbing plant.

The lamina is lanceolate- spathulate in form. It may be up to long and wide. It has an acute or obtuse apex and is gradually attenuate towards the base, which clasps the stem and is not decurrent. Three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are reticulate. Tendrils can be up to long and may or may not have a curl. Rosette and lower pitchers are rarely produced. They are infundibular in the lower two-thirds to three-quarters, and ovoid above. They are distinctly constricted just below the peristome. Terrestrial pitchers grow to in height and in width. Fringed wings are usually absent, but may be present in the upper part. The pitcher mouth is round and horizontal, and raised slightly towards the rear. The peristome is cylindrical, up to wide, and bears indistinct teeth. The lid or operculum is ovate and lacks appendages. An unbranched spur (less than long) is inserted at the base of the lid. The unusual upper pitchers of N. inermis are larger than its lower pitchers, growing to in height and in width. They gradually or abruptly arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a wide curve. They are tubular to infundibular in the lower two-thirds with laterally appressed pitcher walls. As in N. dubia, there is almost no gap between the walls in mature pitchers. The upper part of the pitcher is widely infundibular throughout. Wings are reduced to ribs in upper pitchers. The mouth is round and either horizontal or slightly raised at the front and rear. The inner surface of the pitcher is often said to be glandular throughout with no waxy zone,Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae.

Mature upper pitchers are generally considered to completely lack a peristome, a trait that is unique to this species, although one source gives a peristome width of for an tall upper pitcher (the inner portion of the peristome is said to account for 20% of its total cross-sectional surface length, the lowest proportion among studied species).Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The lid is very long, narrow, and cuneiform. It is never reflexed beyond 90 degrees relative to the mouth. Nepenthes inermis has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle may be up to long. The rachis grows to in length, although it is usually shorter in female inflorescences. Pedicels are bracteolate and up to long. Sepals are oblong-lanceolate and up to long. Young parts of the plant, such as developing pitchers, are covered in a dense indumentum. However, most hairs are caducous and mature parts are virtually glabrous. An exception to this are the hairs on the ovary and some other parts of the inflorescence, which may be persistent. The stem, inflorescence and tendrils are characteristically purplish-red in most plants. The lamina is green, often with a red midrib. Pitchers are yellowish-green. Danser described the colour of herbarium specimens as \\"blackish in all parts\\". Ecology Upper pitchers of N. inermis from Mount Belirang Nepenthes inermis is endemic to a number peaks in the Barisan Mountains that line the western side of Sumatra. More specifically, it is known only from the Indonesian provinces of West Sumatra and Jambi. The species has an altitudinal distribution of above sea level. It usually grows as an epiphyte in mossy forest, but also occurs terrestrially in stunted upper montane vegetation above . Substantial populations of this species are present on Mount Talang, Mount Gadut, and Mount Belirang. Nepenthes inermis is particularly abundant on the western slopes of the latter, where it grows terrestrially. It has also been recorded from Mount Gadang in West Sumatra.Wistuba, A. N.d. Nepenthes inermis. Carnivorous Plant Database. The conservation status of N. inermis is listed as Least concern on the IUCN Red List. Carnivory Nepenthes inermis produces extremely thick mucilaginous pitcher liquid. It is so viscous that if a pitcher is held upside down, the fluid will pour out, forming an unbroken stream several metres in length.Hopkins, M., R. Maulder & B.[R.] Salmon 1990. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 19(1‚Äì2): 19‚Äì28.Salmon, B.[R.] 1993. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 22(1‚Äì2): 11‚Äì12. This fluid coats the entire inner surfaces of the pitchers in a thin film. The pitchers of N. inermis function not only as pitfall traps but also as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid.Rice, B. 2007. Carnivorous plants with hybrid trapping strategies. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 36(1): 23‚Äì27. The fluid also acts as a lubricant, allowing prey items to easily slide down into the bottom of the pitcher cup. The upper pitchers of N. inermis are frequently tipped over during downpours. The rainwater that accumulates in them is lost, but the extremely viscous fluid, together with the laterally appressed walls, ensure that the contents is retained. No longer holding heavy rainwater, the pitchers quickly spring back to an upright position.Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4‚Äì10. A similar trapping method may be employed by related species such as N. dubia, which also produce very viscous pitcher fluid. Nepenthes inermis pitchers mostly trap flying insects, particularly those of the two fly suborders: Nematocera and Brachycera. However, they do not normally contain invertebrate pitcher infauna. It has been suggested that glands on the lid secrete compounds that intoxicate visiting insects, such that they lose their footing and fall into the pitcher. Related species Closeup of the pitcher mouth of N. inermis. The upper pitchers of this species are the only ones in the genus to completely lack a peristome. Nepenthes inermis belongs to a group of closely related montane Sumatran species that includes N. dubia, N. flava,Wistuba, A., J. Nerz & A. Fleischmann 2007. flava, a new species of Nepenthaceae from the northern part of Sumatra. Blumea 52(1): 159‚Äì163. N. jacquelineae, N. jamban,Lee, C.C., Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. Two new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra. Blumea 51(3): 561‚Äì568. N. talangensis, and N. tenuis. These species are characterised by infundibular upper pitchers and highly viscous pitcher fluid. Nepenthes inermis is thought to be most closely related to N. dubia. However, it is easily distinguished from that species as it completely lacks a peristome in its upper pitchers unlike the latter. The pitchers are also usually green, while those of N. dubia tend to be yellow to orange in colour. In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is part of the resultant cladogram, showing \\"Clade 1\\", which has 51% bootstrap support. Its most strongly supported subclade is the sister pair of N. inermis and N. dubia, having 95% support. In his description of the Bornean species N. campanulata, botanist Shigeo Kurata suggested that it may be closely related to N. inermis.Kurata, S. 1973. Nepenthes from Borneo, Singapore and Sumatra. The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore 26(2): 227‚Äì232. However, other taxonomists disagree with this hypothesis.Nerz, J. 1994. Nepenthes-discussion. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List. While these two species are similar in general stature and pitcher morphology, they are not only separated by great geographical distance, but also occur in completely different habitats; N. campanulata is a lowland species endemic to limestone substrates,Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. whereas N. inermis usually grows as an epiphyte at elevations of .Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Natural hybrids =Nepenthes √ó pyriformis= An upper pitcher of N. √ó pyriformis Nepenthes inermis is known to hybridise with N. talangensis on the upper slopes of Mount Talang, where the two species grow sympatrically. N. talangensis was only described as a distinct species in 1994.Nerz, J. & A. Wistuba 1994. Five new taxa of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North and West Sumatra . Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 23(4): 101‚Äì114. Prior to this it was placed within N. bongso and some of the older literature identifies this hybrid as N. bongso √ó N. inermis. Nepenthes inermis √ó N. talangensis has been the subject of taxonomic confusion in the past. In an article published in 1973 on the Nepenthes of Borneo, Singapore, and Sumatra, Shigeo Kurata incorrectly identified specimens of this hybrid as belonging to N. dubia. In 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek published their monograph \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", in which they referred to N. dubia plant material from Mount Talang (Kurata s.n. SING). Charles Clarke later identified Kurata s.n. as representing N. inermis √ó N. talangensis. The natural hybrid is similar to N. dubia, but can be distinguished on the basis of several stable characters. The hybrid has a wider pitcher lid that is never relfexed beyond 90 degrees and the pitcher cup is not appressed in the lower parts as in N. dubia. In addition, the mouth of N. inermis √ó N. talangensis is raised towards the back as opposed to being horizontal. In 2001, Kurata described this hybrid as a new species, N. pyriformis. Kurata, S. 2001. „Çπ„Éû„Éà„É©Â≥∂„Åä„Çà„Å≥„Éü„É≥„ÉÄ„Éä„Ç™Â≥∂Áî£„Ç¶„ÉÑ„Éú„Ç´„Ç∫„É©„ÅÆÔºíÊñ∞Á®Æ(Ëã±Êñá).

Clarke rejected this interpretation in his monograph Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, published the same year. Clarke found that the type specimen of N. pyriformis, Kurata & Mikil 4230 NDC, matches the appearance of N. inermis √ó N. talangensis \\"in most respects\\". =Other hybrids= Where their ranges overlap, N. inermis is also known to hybridise with N. singalana and N. spathulata.McPherson, S.R. 2009.

Two new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra. Blumea 51(3): 561‚Äì568. The specific epithet izumiae honours Izumi Davis, wife of Troy Davis, one of the describing authors. Botanical history The species was mentioned as an undescribed taxon in Charles Clarke's 2001 monograph, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, under the name \\"Nepenthes species B\\". Clarke considered it to be most closely allied to N. singalana, writing that \\"[f]urther research is required to determine whether or not this is simply an unusual variety of N. singalana, or whether it warrants description as a distinct species\\". Flowering-size specimens of N. izumiae, identified as N. singalana from Mount Talakmau, were already in cultivation before the species was formally published.Mansell, G. N.d. New Nepenthes: Nepenthes izumeae . Exotica Plants. Nepenthes izumiae was formally described by Troy Davis, Charles Clarke and Rusjdi Tamin in a 2003 issue of the botanical journal Blumea. Clarke, Davis & Tamin 1309 was designated as the holotype. This specimen was collected in the Barisan Mountains, north of Bukittinggi, on July 13, 2000. It is deposited at the Herbarium Universitas Andalas (ANDA) of Andalas University in Padang, West Sumatra.Nepenthes izumiae Troy Davis, C.Clarke & Tamin. International Plant Names Index (IPNI). The next detailed treatment of N. izumiae appeared in Stewart McPherson's 2009 monograph, Pitcher Plants of the Old World. Description Nepenthes izumiae is a climbing plant growing to a height of 8 m. The stem ranges in colour from green to reddish. The lamina (leaf blade) varies in shape and may be linear, lanceolate, or spathulate. It measures up to 28 cm in length by 8 cm in width and may have a frilled margin. The lamina has an acute apex and narrows towards the base, widening again just before the point of attachment. Longitudinal veins are inconspicuous.Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. A Field Guide to the Nepenthes of Sumatra. PILI-NGO Movement, Bogor. Tendrils are up to 30 cm long and often have a sub-apical or even peltate insertion, joining the lamina on the underside, before the apex. The lamina is green throughout, whereas the midrib and tendril may be green to reddish. Rosette and lower pitchers are typically ovate in the basal quarter to half of the pitcher cup, becoming cylindrical and sometimes slightly infundibular above. A conspicuous hip often delimits these two parts of the trap. Terrestrial pitchers may be quite large, reaching 30 cm in height by 6 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§6 mm wide) runs down the ventral surface of the trap, bearing filaments up to 12 mm long. The peristome is cylindrical at the front and becomes flattened and broader towards the sides and rear, measuring up to 3 cm in width. It bears ribs up to 2 mm high and spaced up to 2.5 mm apart. These ribs terminate in teeth (‚â§8 mm long) on the inner margin of the peristome, the largest being located towards the top. There is often a gap of several millimetres separating the two lobes of the peristome directly below the lid. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate to orbicular and typically has a cordate base as well as a frilled margin. It measures up to 6 cm in length by 4.5 cm in width. A triangular or hook-shaped basal crest (‚â§1 cm long) is commonly present on the lower surface of the lid. An unbranched spur measuring up to 10 mm in length is inserted near the base of the lid. Lower pitchers typically have a very dark pigmentation, being purplish-black throughout. However, the indumentum covering the traps can give them an orange or brownish sheen. The peristome is generally purple, black, or dark brown, but may have lighter coloured teeth ranging from green, through yellow, to white. The inner surface of the pitcher may be light yellow, white, or light purple, and often bears purple speckles. The pitcher lid is often yellow or green on the underside and dark purple on its upper surface. Occasionally, the pitcher may be yellowish-green throughout with a black peristome. Upper pitchers are narrowly infundibular in the basal third to half of the pitcher cup and cylindrical above. A constriction and associated hip often delimit these two parts. Aerial traps are smaller than their terrestrial counterparts, reaching 20 cm in height by 4 cm in width. In upper pitchers, the wings are reduced to ribs. The peristome, which reaches up to 8 mm in width, is cylindrical and expanded at the sides and rear. It bears ribs up to 0.5 mm high and spaced up to 0.5 mm apart as well as teeth up to 1.5 mm long. The pitcher lid is sub-orbicular to slightly ovate and has a cordate base. It measures up to 4.5 cm in length by 4 cm in width. It may or may not bear an appendage on its underside. The spur is simple or branched and attains a length of 5 mm. Upper pitchers exhibit a similar pigmentation to lower pitchers, but are typically lighter. Nepenthes izumiae has a racemose inflorescence up to 18 cm long, of which the peduncle constitutes up to 10 cm and the rachis up to 8 cm. Flowers are borne solitarily on pedicels (‚â§5 mm long) that lack bracts. Tepals are ovate and up to 6 mm long. Fruits reach 15 mm in length. The structure of the male inflorescence has not been documented. An indumentum of red, brown or white hairs up to 1 mm long may be present on the laminar margins, pitchers (particularly lower ones), tendrils, and parts of the inflorescence. Ecology Nepenthes izumiae has only been recorded from two peaks north of Bukittinggi in the Barisan Mountains of West Sumatra, Indonesia. In the interests of conservation, the exact locality was not disclosed in the formal description. The species has an altitudinal range of 1700‚Äì1900 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. The typical habitat of N. izumiae is upper montane mossy forest, where conditions are moist and the plants experience diffused sunlight. At one location, the vegetation is dominated by ferns of the genera Dicranopteris and Dipteris. The species is most commonly epiphytic, often being found on moss- covered branches, but it can also grow terrestrially over a layer of moss. Nepenthes izumiae is naturally sympatric with N. dubia and N. gymnamphora, and a natural hybrid with the former has been recorded. The only known populations of N. izumiae lie outside the boundaries of national parks. Stewart McPherson considers the species to be \\"at significant risk of being poached and over collected\\" and cites the \\"rapid demise\\" of N. aristolochioides, another highly sought-after Sumatran plant, as an example of the possible fate of this species. Nepenthes izumiae is also threatened by forest and shrub fires as well as land development. Related species Nepenthes izumiae is thought to be most closely allied to two other Sumatran endemics: N. lingulata and N. singalana. With the former, N. izumiae shares the general morphology and colouration of its pitchers. However, it can be easily distinguished from that species as it lacks the highly developed filiform appendage that gives N. lingulata its name. It also differs in typically having an orbicular lid, as opposed to the triangular lid of N. lingulata, as well as broader pitchers with more highly developed peristome ribs and an unbranched spur. In addition, N. lingulata completely lacks nectar glands on the underside of the lid and has a very dense woolly indumentum. Nepenthes izumiae differs from N. singalana in that it often possesses a basal crest on the underside of the lid; this structure is never found in N. singalana. Nepenthes izumiae also differs in several other vegetative features: it has broader laminae with persistent hairs on the margins, longer and narrower terrestrial traps, and a thinner peristome with finer ribs and teeth. In addition, whereas N. izumiae is typically epiphytic in growth habit, N. singalana is mostly terrestrial. Nepenthes izumiae may also bear a resemblance to N. bongso and N. ovata, but both of these species have entirely infundibular upper pitchers and often have spathulate laminae with glabrous margins. Nepenthes spathulata could also be confused with N. izumiae, but it can be distinguished on the basis of its wider laminae and pitchers, the latter typically also being lighter in colouration. Natural hybrids In the wild, N. izumiae is known to form natural hybrids with N. dubia and N. jacquelineae. A single mature female plant of N. dubia √ó N. izumiae grows along the summit trail on Mount Talakmau. It produces infundibular upper pitchers that are yellowish-green in colouration. The pitchers are relatively small, reaching only around 10 cm in height. As in N. dubia, the stem and tendrils are purplish-red. The lamina is green with a red midrib. Nepenthes dubia √ó N. izumiae differs most obviously from N. dubia in having an ovate lid that is never reflexed beyond 180 degrees. This hybrid is listed as N. dubia √ó N. singalana in Charles Clarke's 2001 monograph, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, because at the time of its publication it was uncertain whether N. izumiae represented a distinct species.

The Act, drafted to protect the gene pool, allowed for sterilization of mentally disabled persons in order to prevent the transmission of traits to offspring deemed undesirable. At that time, eugenicists argued that mental illness, mental retardation, epilepsy, alcoholism, pauperism, certain criminal behaviours, and social defects, such as prostitution and sexual perversion, were genetically determined and inherited. Further, it was widely believed that persons with these disorders had a higher reproduction rate than the normal population. As a result, it was feared the gene pool in the general population was weakening. During the time the Sexual Sterilization Act was in effect, 4,800 cases were proposed for sterilization in the Province of Alberta, of which 99% received approval. Examination of sterilization records demonstrates that legislation did not apply equally to all members of society. Specifically, the Act was disproportionately applied to those in socially vulnerable positions, including females, children, unemployed persons, domestics, rural citizens, unmarried, institutionalized persons, Roman and Greek Catholics, and persons of Ukrainian, Native and M√©tis ethnicity.(Grekul, 2002) The Act was repealed in 1972. Enactment The Sexual Sterilization Act was first introduced into the legislature on March 5, 1927, but due to a crowded session and unclear bill format, it was pulled from the schedule. On February 23, 1928, the Hon. George Hoadley, Minister of Health, reintroduced the bill with a comment regarding the growing burden of taxpayers in caring for immigrants and mentally disabled persons. Much controversy surrounded the bill and eventually, in March 1928, the People's League to Act was formed. The League, with membership numbers of several hundred, retained counsel and contested the constitutionality of the Sexual Sterilization Act. Despite their efforts, the Act was given Royal Assent on March 21, 1928. For the purposes of the Act, the Alberta Eugenics Board was formed. The Board was to be composed of four members: * Two medical practitioners nominated by the Senate of the University of Alberta and the Council of the College of Physicians * Two persons other than medical practitioners, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Under the terms of the Act, mental hospital inmates could only be discharged with the approval of the medical superintendent, and it was within the superintendent's power to force examination by the Eugenics Board. If in unanimous agreement, the Board was empowered to appoint a physician and direct sterilization. Such operations were not to be performed unless consent was obtained from the inmate, if competent, or consent from a spouse, parent, guardian or Minister of Health if considered incompetent. Further, the Act provided that no surgeon performing an operation could be held liable to any civil action by reason of the operation. Amendments In 1937, an amendment to the Act was proposed by Dr. W.W. Cross, Social Credit Minister of Health, as the Act was considered too restrictive. It was accepted that sterilization was permitted for the benefit of the human race, not the individual, and as such consent was no longer deemed a requirement. At that time, Albertans, seriously affected by the Great Depression, believed sterilization would effect a much-needed saving in dollars. The Act was amended as follows: * A distinction was made between psychotic persons and mentally defective persons. * The criterion for sterilization in both categories was no longer solely genetic. The risk of mental injury to the patient or progeny was now included as grounds for sterilization. * Consent of the person to be sterilized, or of the spouse, parent, guardian or the Minister continued to be needed only in the case of psychotic persons. In addition, the exemption from civil action was extended to include any individual taking part in the surgical operations as well as persons in charge of mental institutions who had caused an inmate to be examined by the Eugenics Board. The Act underwent another amendment in 1942, this time to specifically broaden the category of mental patients who could be directed to undergo sterilization. Despite knowledge of Nazi eugenic atrocities, the Alberta Eugenics Board intended to increase the pace of sterilization. Persons with neurosyphillis, epilepsies with psychosis, mental deterioration, and Huntington's disease could, with consent of the patient, be sterilized. An exception to consent was made for patients presenting with Huntington's chorea who were also psychotic. Repeal It was not until 1969, under the direction of Peter Lougheed, Progressive Conservative and Leader of the Opposition, the Act was reviewed. Mr. Lougheed's party intended to introduce a provincial Bill of Rights and a review of existing legislation was directed in an effort to identify potentially conflicting legislation. Mr. Lougheed attacked the Act on legal and moral grounds and the Progressive Conservative party adopted repeal of the Act as part of their platform. In 1972 David King, MLA Edmonton-Highlands, was successful in introducing a Bill to repeal the Sexual Sterilization Act. Background =Canadian National Committee for Mental Health= In 1918, psychiatrists C.K. Clarke and C. Hincks established the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH). The CNCMH was a self-appointed body of experts available for consultation regarding mental health issues. The Committee claimed that institutionalization of mental degenerates was both expensive and ineffective and promoted the use of preventative measures. The group was active in working for the testing of students and construction of training schools for mental defectives. In addition, they advocated tougher inspection and restriction of immigrants. =Mental health survey= Perhaps the most influential resource for rationalizing sterilization in the Province of Alberta came in the form of a mental health survey. In 1919, Dr. Hincks, professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto and specialist on mental diseases, conducted a survey of the province. His goal was to formulate a treatment and training plan for the mentally deficient that would best serve society. The survey involved a review of facilities for the mentally abnormal. The results were published in the 1921 report entitled Mental Hygiene Survey of the Province of Alberta. The report notes that those who suffer from a mental defect or mental disorder are rightly regarded as social liability and recommends careful screening of immigrants and the use of sexual sterilization to control the abnormal population. Dr. Hincks's committee describes a causal link between mental abnormality and immorality (illegitimacy, criminality, prostitution, dependency). The suggestion that bad behaviour and sexual immorality were directly related to mental deficiency gave rise to concern by the public and politicians that these individuals posed a threat to society. In addition, the committee assumed that mental abnormality could be detected early in life with various test instruments. In the course of their examination, they also reviewed student behaviour at the elementary level by administering intelligence quotient tests to children who had been described by their teachers as ‚Äútroublesome, mischief-makers or general disturbers.‚Äù According to the committee, the tests revealed that such troublesome children were more prone to possess low I.Q. Further, the children were interviewed and a conclusion was reached that these same troublesome children also possessed less sound moral values. It wasn't until much later that the I.Q. tests would be recognized as culturally biased. =United Farmers of Alberta= The United Farmers of Alberta, an agricultural lobbying group, responded quickly to the survey and called on the government to draft legislation for life segregation or sterilization of the feebleminded. The weight of the survey's results, combined with the growing fear that new immigrants were inferior, had generated fears over the protection of land and jobs. In 1923, under growing pressure from the United Farmers of Alberta, Minister of Health, Hon. R.G. Reid, proposed sterilization of mental defectives as a preferable alternative to aggregation in institutions, but concluded that public support would need to be developed. The United Farm Women of Alberta, a group affiliated with the United Farmers of Alberta, answered Reid by launching a campaign for public support in 1924. The group's president, Ms. Margaret Gunn, stated that ‚Äúdemocracy was never intended for degenerates.‚Äù In addition, group member, Ms. J.W. Field, would go on to serve as Secretary on the Alberta Eugenics Board. This group would also recommend compulsory medical examination before marriage for all Albertans. =Other influences= In Western Canada, many influential citizens and interest groups campaigned for segregation and sterilization of the feebleminded. Emily Murphy, the first female magistrate for the British Empire, was a prolific and influential writer who organized meetings and addressed many women's groups in support of negative eugenics. J. S. Woodsworth, preacher and Superintendent of All People's Mission in Winnipeg, conducted and published studies on immigration and social response. Woodsworth's reports concerning the quality of immigrants aided in creating a public crisis. Together, these individuals published numerous articles in popular magazines and spoke at public meetings in support of sterilization. There are also ties to the University of Alberta. Dr. John M. MacEachran, founder of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology, was also long time chairman of the Eugenics Board, and Robert Charles Wallace, President of the University of Alberta in 1934, was an outspoken supporter of eugenic sterilization. The highest form of provincial government would show support - Premier John Edward Brownlee stated that ‚Äúthe argument of freedom or right of the individual can no longer hold good where the welfare of the state and of society is concerned.‚Äù Many other factors influenced public opinion including the creation in 1930 of the Eugenics Society of Canada, acceptance of sterilization laws in many of the United States, and numerous newspapers, magazines and books touting sterilization as a remedy for rapidly increasing social problems. Sexual sterilization on trial In 1995, Leilani Muir sued Alberta for stigmatization as a moron, wrongful confinement, and sterilization. At the age of 10, Muir, an unwanted and abused child, was admitted to the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives (PTS) in Red Deer, Alberta. She was confined to the facility until 1965 when she left against medical direction. Years later, during struggles with infertility, failed marriages and depression, Muir would learn that she had been sterilized during an appendectomy while detained at the PTS. Further, IQ testing would reveal that Muir did not suffer from mental deficiency. The court ruled in favour of the plaintiff and awarded Muir $740,780 CAD and an additional sum of $230,000 CAD for legal costs. This precedent-setting case opened the doors for other individuals seeking reparation for suffering under the Sexual Sterilization Act. Resources * Christian, Timothy J.

She and three other ladies-in- waiting (Mary Livingston, Mary Beaton and Mary Seton) were collectively known as \\"The Four Marys\\". A granddaughter of James IV of Scotland, she married the queen's renowned secretary, Sir William Maitland of Lethington. Life Mary Fleming was the youngest child of Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming and Lady Janet Stewart. She was born in 1542, the year her father was taken prisoner by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss. Her mother was an illegitimate daughter of James IV of Scotland. Lady Fleming became a governess to the infant queen, also born in 1542, and the dowager queen, Mary of Guise, chose Lady Fleming's daughter Mary to be one of four companions to the young queen. Mary Fleming and Mary, Queen of Scots, were first cousins. In 1548, five-year- old Mary Fleming and her mother accompanied Mary, Queen of Scots, to the court of King Henry II of France, where the young queen was raised. Mary Fleming's father having died the previous year in the Battle of Pinkie, her mother had an affair with the French king, the product of which was a son born around 1551. Mary, Queen of Scots and her companions returned to Scotland in 1561 after the death of Francis II of France. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph recorded that the queen was consoled by Mary Fleming when she was disturbed by the discovery of the French poet Chastelard hiding in her bedchamber. After having \\"some grief of mind\\" the Queen took Mary to be her \\"bedfellow\\".Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 886, 688. During the twelfth day of Christmas pageant in January 1564, Mary Fleming played the part of Queen of the Bean. Thomas Randolph was drawn into the dance, and described the costumes: > \\"The queen of the Bean was that day in a gown of cloth of silver; her head, > her neck, her shoulders, the rest of her whole body so be-sett with stones, > that more in our whole jewel house were not to be found. The Queen herself > that day apparreled in colours white & black, no neither jewel or gold about > her that day, but the ring that I brought her from (Queen Elizabeth) hanging > at her breast, with a lace of black and white about her neck.\\"'Wigton > Papers', Miscellany of the Maitland Club, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1840), pp. > 391-2. On 19 September 1564 William Kirkcaldy of Grange wrote that the Royal Secretary, William Maitland was showing an interest in Mary Fleming: \\"I doubt not but you understand me by now, that our secretary's wife is near dead, and he a suitor to Mrs Fleming, who is as fit for him, as I am to be Pope!Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 34, 75. Marriage to Maitland Mary Fleming married the queen's royal secretary, Sir William Maitland of Lethington, who was many years her senior. The following evidence suggests that the marriage was successful, despite rumors that they were unhappy and that Mary wished to murder her husband: # The wedding occurred after a three-year courtship that weathered ambivalent relations between Maitland and Mary, Queen of Scots, to whom Mary Fleming was a lady-in-waiting and had been since the age of five. # Maitland was so infatuated with Mary Fleming that he wrote to William Cecil about it. # The courtship was the talk of both the Scottish and English courts. Mary Fleming and her husband were in Edinburgh Castle in 1573 when it was held by supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots against an English army supporting the government of James VI of Scotland. She was captured with her husband when the castle surrendered on 28 May 1573. She was surrendered to Regent Morton and kept a prisoner in Robert Gourlay's House.Daniel Wilson, Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 226. Her husband was carried out of the castle on a litter, because he was unable to stand or walk. He died at Leith on 9 June 1573 before his trial, in the custody of William Drury.Harry Potter, Edinburgh Under Siege, 1571-1573 (Stroud, 2003), p. 145. Mary Fleming was forced to give up her possessions. Jewellery given or loaned to her by the Queen of Scots was taken by the English commander William Drury. Mary Fleming wrote to William Cecil on 21 June imploring that the body of her husband, \\"which when alive has not been spared in her hieness service, may now after his death, receive no shame or ignominy.‚Äù As a result, Queen Elizabeth asked Regent Morton to spare the body, which he did.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1571-1574, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 590-1 no. 700: Harry Potter, Edinburgh Under Siege, 1571-1573 (Stroud, 2003), p. 145. On 29 June 1573 and again on 15 July she was ordered to return a chain or necklace of rubies and diamonds in her possession.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland: 1566-1574, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), p. 355. The piece had been a pledge for money lent to William Kirkcaldy of Grange, captain of Edinburgh Castle.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 193-4. Later life Mary Fleming did not receive the restoration of Lethington's estate and properties until 1581/2, by grant of King James VI. While there is some dispute about this, the evidence is that she never remarried. She had two children, a boy James, who later became a Catholic and lived in France and Belgium in self-imposed exile, and a daughter Margaret, who married Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe. In 1581, Mary, Queen of Scots asked Elizabeth I to grant Fleming safe conduct so she could visit the imprisoned Queen of Scots. There is no evidence that Mary Fleming Maitland actually went. The last documents attributed to her are her letter to William Cecil and a letter to her sister discussing some bad feelings that existed between Fleming and her brother-in-law Coldingham. In popular culture In the 2007 film Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Mary Stuart's lady-in-waiting, Annette Fleming, played by Susan Lynch, is an allusion to Mary Fleming. In the 2013-17 CW television series Reign, the character, Lady Lola Fleming, played by Anna Popplewell is loosely based on Mary Fleming. In the 2018 film Mary, Queen of Scots, Mary Fleming is played by Romanian actress Maria-Victoria Dragus.

Although the genus name translates literally as \\"scorpion fish\\", true scorpionfish (such as lionfish) belong to the related family Scorpaenidae. The cabezon is the only known member of its genus. Description The cabezon is a scaleless fish with a broad bony support extending from the eye across the cheek just under the skin. It has 11 spines on the dorsal fin. The cabezon also has a stout spine before the eye, an anal fin of soft rays, and a fleshy flap on the middle of the snout. A pair of longer flaps are just behind the eyes. The mouth is broad with many small teeth. The coloring varies, but is generally mottled with browns, greens and reds. >90% of red fish are males, whereas >90% of green fish are females. The flesh is blue in color as are the internal organs. It reaches up to in length and in weight, while the largest ever Cabezon caught was in weight and longest being . As the Spanish-origin name implies, the fish has a very large head relative to its body. Distribution and habitat Cabezon are found in the northeast Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Baja California. They are found in a wide range of habitats at depths of , including rocky, muddy and sandy bottoms, and kelp beds. Fishing technique Cabezon feed on crustaceans, mollusks, fish and fish eggs. Cabezon are taken as a game fish, however their roe is toxic to humans, because of the occurrence of a toxic phospholipid (Dinogunellin). Cabezon inhabit the tops of rocky ledges as opposed to rockfish and lingcod, which usually inhabit the sheer faces of these features.

Although his claims earned him little publicity during his lifetime, Thompson might have been the first North American contactee. Researcher Jerome Clark describes the account as \\"surely the most outlandish story in early UFO history [and] also one of the most obscure\\".Clark, Jerome, The UFO Encyclopedia: The Phenomenon from the Beginning, Volume 2, L-Z, Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1998 (2nd edition, 2005), The story earned a brief, 11 paragraph, mention in a local newspaper in 1950 (on April 1, leading some to suspect the entire story was a hoax or prank), and the full story was not publicized until more than three decades afterwards.\\"Centralian Tells Strange Tale of Visiting Venus Space Ship in Eastern Lewis County\\" from the Centralia Daily Chronicle, April 1, 1950 Thompson's story A retired railroad worker in his 70s, Thompson claimed that on the evening of March 28, 1950, while driving to his home in Centralia, Washington, he came across a large flying saucer in the woods. The saucer, he claimed, was about 80 feet (24 m) across and 30 feet (9 m) tall. Two naked, deeply tanned children, human in form but very attractive, were playing near the craft's entrance ramp. Thompson claimed to have approached to within about 50 feet (15 m) of the saucer, which emitted a strong sun-like heat. Several naked adults ‚Äî humanoid, attractive, and also deeply tanned ‚Äî then appeared at the craft's door. After realizing Thompson meant them no harm, they beckoned him closer. The crew consisted of 20 adults and 25 children, the latter from about 5 to 15 years of age. Thompson claimed to have spent the next 40 hours with the humanoids. They were from Venus, he learned, and had stopped at Earth despite the fact that other Venusian saucers had been shot at by Earth-based military forces. The Venusians said that all of Earth's problems stemmed from astrology: humans were born under different star signs, while Venusians were all born under the sign of Venus, as was Thompson. The Venusians further claimed, said Thompson, that they were vegetarian, and that they never grew ill. Thompson also claimed the Venusians were na√Øve and childlike: they did not know who had built their flying saucers, and seemed to possess little to no curiosity. Thompson claimed that he was the first of many Earthlings who would meet the Venusians, and that after humanity had seen the wisdom of Venusian ways, Jesus Christ would return in 10,000 AD. Thompson claimed to have stayed on the spaceship until March 30, 1950. He tried to photograph the spaceship, he claimed, but the object was too bright to appear on film as more than a blob of light. He could see the Venusians any time he wanted, but could not tell all the information he had learned from them. Publicity Afterwards, pilot Kenneth Arnold ‚Äî whose 1947 sighting had sparked widespread public interest in UFOs ‚Äî interviewed Thompson. Arnold did not believe the story was literally true, but neither could he accept that the poorly- educated, seemingly sincere Thompson was a blatant liar or prankster. Arnold speculated that Thompson might have had a psychic experience. In 1980, Arnold donated a copy of his 1950 Thompson interview tape to Fate magazine. Clark's article \\"The Coming of the Venusians\\" was published in the January 1981 issue of Fate. Clark speculated that Thompson had had a visionary experience, which was inspired by, and which drew from, UFO folklore and Biblical stories. Similarities to other UFO cases Clark noted similarities between the Thompson case and an 1897 claim during the mystery airship reports. There are also some similarities between Thompson's story and the latter, as well as the far better known account of George Adamski; but Clark argues that it is unlikely that Adamski knew of Thompson.

Publication history The first version (Lee Guardineer) first appeared in Tales to Astonish #56 (June 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Dick Ayers. The last name Guardineer is a reference to the Golden Age comics creator Fred Guardineer who created Zatara, Tor, and Merlin the Magnificent who were all magician crimefighters. Fictional character biography =Lee Guardineer= Lee Guardineer is a stage magician who used his stage acts to rob rich party guests. His activities attracted the attention of Giant-Man's ants who reported this. The Magician then robbed a yacht party run by the rich socialite Sterling Stuyvesant and kidnapped the Wasp to make Giant-Man jealous. In response, Giant-Man set up a phony yacht party which lured the Magician to a trap. Once that trap was sprung, Giant-Man captured the Magician and saved the Wasp. The Magician was fished out of the water by the police and later taken to prison.Tales to Astonish #56. Marvel Comics. While Hank Pym was out of town, the Magician escaped from prison and set up a clothing store with Wasp- inspired clothing. When the Wasp arrived, the Magician attacks in order to capture the Wasp. However, the Wasp soon makes short work of the Magician using quick thinking and the store's many toys to take down the Magician who is promptly arrested by the police.Tales to Astonish #58. Marvel Comics. Sometime later, Lee was released from prison and moved to Tampa with a dancer named Chasity to start a new family where he had a son.Astonishing Ant-Man #2. Marvel Comics. =Son of Lee Guardineer= Lee Guardineer had an unnamed son who took up the Magician mantle as part of the \\"All-New, All-Different Marvel\\" event. Upon taking his father's mantle, Magician joined the Power Broker's Hench App (a mobile app that enabled people to solicit the service of supervillains). His first job has him hired by publicist Marlena Howard to pretend to have a grudge against Darla Deering for not hiring him for the opening act of the woman's show. The Magician interrupted Deering in the middle of her break-up fight against Ant-Man and confronted the two heroes with genetically-modified rabbits and pigeons. After explaining his origin to Ant-Man, the Magician intentionally lost to Miss Thing. The fight between the Magician and Ant-Man and Darla was staged and filmed because it would make a successful pilot episode for Darla's newest reality show. Powers and abilities The Lee Guardineer version of Magician is a skilled stage magician, trickster, and illusionist where his tricks rely on his technology. Besides being a master pickpocket, he is an expert animal trainer and can hypnotize anyone at will. The Magician has a motorized cane with a hatch on top that can act as a vacuum and be used as a divining rod to seek out his enemies. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Magician is Elliot Boggs. His powers first emerged uncontrollably, apparently killing both of his parents. After being subdued by S.H.I.E.L.D., custody of him is given over to Professor Charles Xavier in the hopes Elliot can control his powers. When Elliot awakes, he quickly urges Cyclops to let him join the X-Men. Shorthanded, Cyclops allows Elliot to help the X-Men take on the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy attacking the 'Academy of Tomorrow. During the battle, Elliot manages to easily defeat the Blob. Afterwards, he adopts the Magician code name, which is suggested by television reporters. Several of the X-Men observe that the reporters got there amazingly fast, as well as the fact that the Brotherhood had no reason for the initial attack in the first place. After Elliot's interview, the X-Men are on good terms with the press for the first time since Magneto returned after an presumed death.Ultimate X-Men #71. Marvel Comics. Later during an attack by the Friends of Humanity on a hospital that gave treatments to mutants (despite there being no mutant patients at the time and in broad daylight), Elliot once again fights alongside the X-Men. It turns out the group's leader is actually a mutant incapacitating the rest of the X-Men leaving only Elliot standing. The young mutant single-handedly defeats the mutant leader. Before the X-Men returned to the mansion, Nick Fury paid Xavier a visit, requesting that Elliot join the Ultimates. However, Xavier refuses to which Fury says Elliot's parents have agreed to their son joining the Ultimates. Xavier is shocked to hear about the boy's parents, as Xavier was told that Elliot had killed his parents. When Fury is unable to recall saying or doing this and only heard of Elliot when he started appearing with the X-Men, Charles realizes something is very wrong.Ultimate X-Men #72. Marvel Comics. Charles and Nick believe that Elliot has been messing with their minds, creating the illusion of Nick bringing him to Charles. Fury states that even if Elliot had made everyone forget, there would still be a record on file at S.H.I.E.L.D. The two await Elliott's arrival to confront him. When the jet lands, Charles asks Elliot to \\"come clean\\". Xavier confronts him with the truth that his parents are not dead and that Fury never took him to the mansion. When everyone begins attacking him, Elliot tries to make everyone all stop and forget why they are attacking him but this tactic fails to work completely thanks to Charles' interference. Elliot decides he's through playing games and that he could have made the X-Men popular but now he has to kill everyone. However, Elliot is unaware of Jean Grey's presence much to Elliot's surprise.Ultimate X-Men #73. Marvel Comics. A battle ensues, in which Magician once again summons the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy out of thin air. Magician binds the X-Men in metal and Jean fights the entire Brotherhood alone. Jean speaks psychically to Wolverine and obtains permission to burn away the metal binding him. Wolverine acquiesces and attacks Magician with little or no skin left. As the battle progresses, Wolverine slowly heals, slicing Magician's throat and finally jamming claws through him, apparently making Magician (and all traces of his work) disappear. A conversation between Magician and Kitty Pryde later revealed that Magician simply wants to be left alone and wanted some closure to his story. It is revealed Kitty doesn't see or hear the Magician in any way. Magician states that he will now go somewhere that \\"there aren't any people, like Antarctica or something.\\"Ultimate X-Men #74.

Name The 6th century Byzantine historian Procopius writes that the Roman general Pompey captured the then ancient fortress and renamed it Colonia, in Greek Koloneia (ŒöŒøŒªœéŒΩŒµŒπŒ±).Procopius De Aedificiis 3.4.6-7 A Greek inscription of the ninth or tenth century found in the fortress securely identifies ≈ûebinkarahisar with Koloneia. Curiously, the Seljuk historian Ibn Bibi and 14th-century coins minted by the Eretnids record an Armenian variation of the name, Koƒüoniya. The historical Turkish form of this name was Kuƒüuniya. In the 11th century, a second name becomes associated with the place: the town retains the name Koloneia but the fortress above is called Mavrokastron, Greek for \\"Black Fortress\\". The Turkish toponym Karahisar (Greek: ŒìŒ±œÅŒ¨œÉŒ±œÅŒ∑, actual Turkish name of the district: Gareysar), appearing first in the 14th century, is a translation of Mavrokastron.Bryer and Winfield, p. 146 The town was later called ≈ûapkarahisar (\\"Black Fortress of Alum\\") or Kara Hisar-ƒ± ≈ûark√Æ/≈ûark√Æ Kara Hisar (\\"Black Fortress of the East\\") to differentiate it from Afyonkarahisar farther to the west. The place has been known as ≈ûebinkarahisar since the 19th century and both names were used. On 11 October 1924 Mustafa Kemal visited this town and proposed to be used the name ≈ûebin Karahisar. The geographical historian Ramsay, indicated that the Armenians still call this city Nikopoli (Greek: ŒùŒπŒ∫œåœÄŒøŒªŒ∑);,W. M. Ramsay, The Historical Geography of Asia Minor, Cambridge University Press, 2010, , p. 57. so do the Pontic Greeks till nowadays. It should not be confused with the nearby Koyulhisar, where the ruins of ancient Roman Nikopoli lie.Presenting Nikopolis (Garasari) region in greek History The recorded history of ≈ûebinkarahisar begins with the Third Mithridatic War. After the defeat of Mithridates VI, Pompey strengthened the town's fortifications and founded a Roman colony (colonia). In the Byzantine period, the city was rebuilt by Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). In the 7th century, it became part of the Armeniac Theme, and later of Chaldia, before finally becoming the seat of a separate theme by 863. It was attacked by Arab raids in 778 and in 940. ≈ûebinkarahisar fell to the Seljuk Turks soon after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. It remained in Turkish hands since, with the exception of a short-lived Byzantine recovery ca. 1106. Through the following centuries, the fortress occupied a strategic position on the frontier between the Turkish-controlled interior and the Empire of Trebizond. The Danishmends held the fortress until the 1170s, when it passed into the hands of the Saltukids of Erzurum. In 1201/1202 the Mengujekids, vassals of the Seljuks of Rum, took over. Following the Mongol invasion of the mid-13th century, the fortress was under command of the Eretnids, who minted coins in the town. A succession of petty Turkmen warlords controlled the town until Uzun Hasan of the Ak Koyunlu took over in 1459, perhaps believing that the place constituted part of the dowry of his new Greek wife, the daughter of John IV of Trebizond.Bryer and Winfield, p. 148 Mehmed II took the town for the Ottomans from Ak Koyunlu in 1461, and consolidated his rule over the area in 1473 following his defeat of Uzun Hasan at the Battle of Otluk Beli. From ≈ûebinkarahisar he sent a series of letters announcing his victory, including an unusual missive in the Uyghur language addressed to the Turkmen of Anatolia. A careful survey of the fortifications above the town has revealed that the Ottomans invested heavily in repairs to the original Late Antique-Byzantine-Seljuk walls and, in addition, constructed an impressive ‚Äúcitadel complex‚Äù at the summit.Robert W. Edwards, ‚ÄúThe Fortress of ≈ûebinkarahisar (Koloneia),‚Äù Corso di Cultura sull' Arte Ravennate e Bizantina 32 (1985), pp. 23-64. It became a sanjak centre as \\"Karahisar-I ≈ûarki\\", initially in Rum Eyalet (1473-1514 and again 1520-1555), Bayburt Eyalet (1514-1516), Diyarbekir Eyalet (1516-1520), Erzurum Eyalet (1555-1805), Trabzon Eyalet (1805-1865) and Sivas Vilayet (1865-1923). According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of ≈ûebinkarahisar (Karahisar-i ≈ûarki) had a total population of 35.051, consisting of 19.421 Muslims, 8.512 Greeks and 7.118 Armenians.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 136-137 =The Shabin-Karahisar uprising= ≈ûebinkarahisar was one of the few locations where Armenians actively resisted the Armenian Genocide.Richard G. Hovannisian, \\"The Armenian Genocide: History, Politics, Ethics\\" Published 1992 Palgrave Macmillan, p. 289, Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkichayan, \\"The Armenians: Past and Present in the Making of National Identity\\", Published 2005 Routledge, pg. 93, As news of deportations and massacres in other parts of the Ottoman Empire reached the town, its Armenian population decided to make preparations for self-defence. On June 15, 1915 some 300 Armenians, mostly wealthy merchants, were arrested. On the following day, after further attempted arrests, fighting erupted and barricades were erected in the town's Armenian districts. By June 18 most of those districts had fallen or been abandoned. Some 5,000 Armenians from the town and nearby villages, 75% of them women and children, retreated into ≈ûebinkarahisar's medieval fortress. It was then surrounded by Turkish troops, who directed heavy artillery at its walls. On the night of July 11, with food, water, and ammunition almost exhausted, the Armenians decided to secretly evacuate the fortress. However, the attempt was discovered and all who had left were killed. On July 12 those still inside the fortress surrendered. A massacre then followed in which all Armenian men were killed. Women and children survivors were held prisoner in the town before being deported like those of other towns. According to official Turkish records, during the revolt the Armenian rebels killed 403 civilian Turkish villagers. book description =The Republic of Turkey= When the republic was founded in 1923 the 10th Army was garrisoned here, bringing a boost to the local economy.

Summer season is hot and dry. Winter season is cold and wet. The climate is influenced by the high elevation of the villages. High elevation reduces the hotness of summer. It snows in winter. Population Ninety-five percent (95%) of the population of Uludere is B√∂lgenini. The most populous tribe is Goyan, which includes members who are Kurds. History The Urartu, Assyrians, the Medes, the Persians, the Romans, and the Sassanids are the early invaders of this land. Eventually the region fell under the rule of the Arsacid Dynasties. In 1260, the Hulagu Hakkari region was attacked by Imadeddin Zengi'in and endured years of tumult. The local rulers were forced to accept Karakoyunlu leadership in 1349. Uludere came under Timurid and Safavid rule in 1386. In 1502 Uludere (Kƒ±laban), was governed by Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in its internal affairs, such as connecting all provincial lords. Protection was given to the sovereign rights of tribal princes, except that the Ottoman land system dominated. The empire could also demand the sending of troops to support their campaigns. The Sindi tribe dominated the region during the Ottoman period. The ancient Assyrian tribes of Geramon/Halmon and Arosh existed within the realm of this district, in the modern small towns of Anda√ß and Ortak√∂y, respectively. = Modern history = After the proclamation of the Turkish republic, Uludere turned into a parish connected with the town of Beytussebap. With Law No. 7033, enacted on 27 June 1957, the area became part of the Hakkari province, and remained so until 1990. (√á√∂lemerik) was a district of the province. Law No. 3474, issued on 16 May 1990, put the village in the newly founded province of Sirnak. The Uludere Municipality was established in 1958. Nature An important cultural element of the province of ≈ûƒ±rnak is a rich folklore based on the natural world around them. Houses built from the soil in this region still exist and are considered a rare architectural sight. Uludere is a town rich in local flora and fauna. In spring, Lusi, Kerenk, as well as many different edible plants and vegetables, can be collected in the Pƒ±ncar Highlands. In the summer, I≈ügƒ±n and Temtol plants from the pastures provide a good food-source. All are also sold locally in bazaars. There are numerous endemic plant species such as tulips and mountain Lalesidir. Uludere inverted-tulips, or mountain tulips as they are also known, only grow in the mountains of Hakkari, and are protected by law. They are regarded as the symbol of the township. There has been research conducted into the extinction of the Anatolia Caspian tiger in the area, with the last one being seen in February 1970. Many other species still exist in the area, including mountain goats, bear, wild boar, deer, rabbits, foxes, partridges and numerous other bird species. Tourism, especially in the winter, is economically important to the area.

Background In 1132, the disaffected Ranulf had garnered a large force with his ally, the prince of Capua, Robert II. The rebels massed outside of Benevento and that city, usually faithful to Roger, gave in. Roger, in shock, wheeled his army around and turned instead for Nocera, the greatest fortified city of the prince of Capua, other than Capua itself. The retreat over the Apennines was miraculously quick, but the rebels moved equally speedily to meet the royal army at Nocera, but Roger destroyed the sole bridge spanning the river Sarno. The rebels, with rapidity equally miraculous, constructed a temporary bridge and moved in on the Noceran siege. Deployment Roger raised his siege at the coming of the rebel army and Ranulf sent 250 knights ahead to the city walls to divert a fraction of the royal troops. The rebel army formed into two wings. Robert of Capua headed up the left wing and Ranulf the right. Each of the rebel wings was itself deployed into three divisions. Robert's divisions were formed in column, with mounted troops in the first and third lines, and foot soldiers in the second line. Ranulf formed his all-cavalry wing with his divisions in line. King Roger formed his army into eight divisions. These were deployed opposite Robert's wing in a column, that is, one division behind the other. The royal army, which included Muslim infantry, was said to have 3,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, \\"numbers which are certainly inflated.\\"Beeler, p 80 Having forced a crossing, the rebel army was \\"in a dangerous tactical position, for with the river at their backs, there would be scant possibility of an orderly retreat across the single bridge over the Sarno.\\"Beeler, p 81 Battle On 24 July, a Roger initiated the engagement, charging the prince's knights. The royal troops broke Robert's first and second lines. The Capuan infantry retreated over the makeshift bridge, which collapsed and a thousand supposedly drowned. The Capuan third division held firm and counterattacked. By this time, the second royal division had been sent into the contest. Roger ordered a second charge, which was initially successful, pushing back the remaining Capuans. At this moment, Ranulf joined the fray with 500 of the mounted men from his centre. He hit Roger's left flank and the royalists began to waver. Before reinforcements could be sent to help them, Ranulf had sent in his right and then his left divisions. The royal troops crumbled under the \\"successive shocks as they came into action.\\"Beeler, p 82 Roger himself tried to inspire them, but they were already in retreat, the flight of the first two divisions having panicked the others. The king barely escaped to Salerno guarded by only four knights. The rebel victory was absolute. Aftermath Seven hundred knights and twenty-four loyalist barons were captured, along with the royal camp. The royal infantry suffered heavy losses in the rout. The booty was immense, according to both rebel-sympathising chroniclers, like Falco of Benevento, and royalists, like Henry, Bishop of Saint Agatha. Among the booty was the bull of Antipope Anacletus II granting Roger the royal title. The battle was of little long-term importance, however, because Pope Innocent II and Emperor Lothair II did not continue past Rome and so the rebels, without further assistance, lost many of their gains and were forced to surrender by July 1134.

It's easy for a photographer to get spoiled by the overwhelming diversity of subjects every time you're out. Of course working in the tropics presents some real obstacles for photography, but it's always worth the effort.\\" Tropical pitcher plants (Nepenthes) have been a major focus of his for over 12 years, and he has published a number of papers on their taxonomy. \\"A lot of my travel over the past decade has been in the pursuit of rare Nepenthes and this has taken me to many really remote parts of Southeast Asia.\\" His photographs have appeared in numerous articles and books, and are featured in Pitcher Plants of Sarawak, The Fishes of Kuching Rivers, and the second edition of Pitcher Plants of Borneo. He occasionally undertakes assignment photography, although freelance work remains his main interest. In addition to his photography, Ch'ien is currently engaged as a consultant at the Botanical Research Centre (Sarawak Forestry Corporation) in Kuching and also periodically works as a nature guide for private group tours in Sarawak and Sabah, and occasionally the Philippines and Indonesia.

In August 1997 he joined Gillingham, where he enjoyed the most successful spell of his career. He captained the Kent side for a lengthy spell and was also named the club's player of the year on an unprecedented four occasions, although his final reign ended in a bizarre dispute with chairman Paul Scally in which Smith reportedly refused to hand back the trophy until he was paid money he claimed the club owed him.

Cattolica, with its five affiliated campuses, is the largest private university in Europe and the largest Catholic University in the world. Its main campus is located in Milan, Italy, with satellite campuses in Brescia, Piacenza, Cremona and Rome. The University is organized into 12 faculties and 7 postgraduate schools. Cattolica provides undergraduate courses (Bachelor's degree, which corresponds to Italian Laurea Triennale), graduate courses (Master's degree, which corresponds to Laurea Magistrale, and specializing master) and PhD programs (Dottorati di ricerca). In addition to these, the University runs several double degree programs with other institutions throughout the world. Degrees are offered both in Italian and in English. UCSC has been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system, in the following fields: employability, teaching, facilities and engagement. Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic serves as the teaching hospital for the medical school of the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore and owes its name to the university founder, the Franciscan friar, physician and psychologist Agostino Gemelli. History =The project= The embryonic project of a Catholic university began around 1870, guided by representatives of various Catholic cultural currents. In September 1918, when the First world war was ending, Giuseppe Toniolo, before dying, recommended to Father Agostino Gemelli and his staff to found the University, saying: \\"I will not see the end of the war, but you, when it is finished, do it, found the Universit√† Cattolica\\". =The foundation and the establishment of faculties= Inauguration of the headquarters of largo Gemelli in 1930 In 1919 Father Agostino Gemelli, Ludovico Necchi, Francesco Olgiati, Armida Barelli, and Ernesto Lombardo founded the Istituto Giuseppe Toniolo di Studi Superiori. On June 24, 1920, the Institute was legally recognized with a decree signed by the Minister of Education, Benedetto Croce; at the same time, Pope Benedict XV officially recognized the University's ecclesiastical status. UCSC in 1950s On December 7, 1921, the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore was officially inaugurated with a special Mass celebrated by Father Gemelli in the presence of Achille Ratti the Cardinal and Archbishop of Milan, who three months later was elected Pope Pius XI. The first campus was in Palazzo del Canonica, at via Sant'Agnese 2. In October 1930 it was moved to the ancient St. Ambrose Monastery, where the main campus remains today. In 1921, 68 students enrolled in the university's 2 available programs, philosophy and social sciences. As of 2016, 14 programs were offered to 30,263 students distributed over the Milan, Brescia, Cremona, Piacenza and Rome campuses. In 1924, following recognition from the Italian state allowing the awarding of legally-recognized degrees the Humanities and Law Programs were inaugurated. The charter of the Universit√† Cattolica was approved by Royal Decree on October 2, 1924, and published on October 31 on the Gazzetta Ufficiale. In 1923 the Istituto Superiore di Magistero was opened and in 1936 became an independent program, later evolving to become, in 1996, the School of Education Sciences. Milan campus In 1926 the economics and politics departments became independent from the School of Law and, in 1931, the autonomous Faculty of Political, Economic and Social Sciences was born, awarding also the university's business degrees until 1947. In 1936 the School of Political Science became independent. The work and efforts of the Universit√† Cattolica continued throughout the post-war period with new campuses and programs opening. The School of Economics officially opened in 1947 with both day and night classes. On October 30, in the presence of Italian President Luigi Einaudi, the first stone of the Piacenza campus was laid, with the official opening of the School of Agricultural Sciences taking place in November 1952. On August 4, 1958, the official decree for the opening of a Medical School in Rome, which had been advocated by Father Gemelli, was approved. Enormous difficulties had made this long and complicated, and it was not until the end of the 1950s that the Biological Institutes and the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic were built in Rome. Construction began in 1959; in 1961 Pope John XXIII opened the Medical School, with the first medical doctors graduating in 1967. The school now offers both medical and dentistry programs. In 1956 the Brescia campus of UCSC was inaugurated with the opening of the School of Teaching and Education. In 1971, at the initiative of important figures in the mathematical field, the School of Mathematics, Physics, and Natural Sciences was opened. During the 1990s other schools were opened in Milan: the School of Banking, Finance, and Insurance Sciences (1990); the School of Foreign Languages and Literature (today the College of Linguistics) and Foreign Literature (1991); and the School of Psychology (1999). In 1997 in Piacenza the School of Economics, once part of the Milan curriculum, opened independently, and the School of Law in 1995. In 2000 thirteen Cultural Centres were opened across Italy. In these Centers, through advanced satellite technology, distance-learning courses was activated in collaboration with the major university campuses. During the 2001‚Äì2002 academic year the new School of Sociology, the fourteenth college of the Universit√† Cattolica, was opened in Milan. In 2012 two new schools were established: the school of Political and Social Science in Milan (from the union of the existing Faculty of Political Science and Sociology) and the School of Economics and Law in Piacenza-Cremona (from the union of the Faculty of Economics and Law Piacenza-Cremona). The Cattolica after the bombings =World War II= During World War II, Ezio Franceschini, who supported the Resistance, organized meetings of the Freedom Volunteer Corps (coordination structure of the partisans) in the university. Towards the end of the war, in 1944, the professor of medieval Latin letters hid, in the basement of Cattolica, a box containing documents and books on the Resistance and FRAMA group founded by Ezio Franceschini. The SS rummaged everywhere in UCSC to find those cards but, buried among the bones of fifty skeletons dead from an epidemic of plague in the sixteenth century, they remained there and emerged only after the war. The Cattolica was partially destroyed by bombing on August 15‚Äì16, 1943, including several classrooms, an administration building, the office building, a cloister by Bramante, an ancient staircase, the hall of honour, and some colleges. The reconstruction work began immediately, moved by the words of Agostino Gemelli \\"rise again more beautiful and bigger than before\\". =Protests of 1968= A speech by Mario Capanna in 1967. In the foreground, the rector at the time, Ezio Franceschini. After the university increased tuition fees on November 15, 1968, protests began at UCSC, Milan, and spread throughout Italy. Students who occupied the University were expelled by the rector Ezio Franceschini with the help of the police led by Commissioner Luigi Calabresi. Three days later 30,000 students marched through Milan to the archbishop's residence and the protest spread to every major university in the country. On March 21, the Cattolica was reoccupied by the police, after being evacuated and closed indefinitely. A few days later, on March 25, there was the so-called \\"battle of Largo Gemelli\\", where thousands of students tried to reopen the university but were strongly repelled by police. The leader of the protest was Mario Capanna, a student of philosophy at the Universit√† Cattolica. =The Italian cabinet of 2011= In November 2011 the Prime Minister Mario Monti appointed three professors as ministers. The rector Lorenzo Ornaghi was appointed minister for heritage and cultural activities; Renato Balduzzi, professor of constitutional law, was appointed minister of health; and Dino Piero Giarda, professor of public economics at the faculty of economics, became minister for relations with Parliament. After the appointment of Professor Lorenzo Ornaghi as a minister, all the powers and functions belonging to the office of rector were entrusted to the vicar vice- chancellor, Prof. Franco Anelli, for the term of Ornaghi's office. Rector The Magnifico Rettore is the most senior post in this institution, elected every 4 years by the board of directors. The role of the Rector is to represent the University and to convene and chair the board of directors, the management committee, the academic senate, and the board of the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic.

Style Although a leader of the Quebec \\"neo-traditional\\" scene, the band takes a definitely modern slant on that style, borrowing stories and characters from French Canadian folklore (the devil, the chasse-galerie, the shepherdess, the coureur des bois, drinking songs, etc.) to write about modern themes with a touch of humor. These themes include globalization (Qui nous m√®ne?), politics (√áa va mal), generational conflicts (D√©g√©n√©rations/Le reel du foss√©), over- medicating (Rem√®de miracle), the frenetic pace of modern life (Train de vie/le surcheval, Continuer pareil), recent Quebec history (2096 (chanson √† boire)), etc. Some of their songs involve personalities from Quebec history such as \\"La Corriveau\\" (La Corrida de la Corriveau), \\"The Great Antonio\\" (Antonio) and \\"Alexis le Trotteur\\" (Train de vie/le surcheval). The band also wrote humorous songs about Qu√©b√©cois cultural phenomena such as poutine (Hommage en grain). History In November 2005 their album En famille went platinum (100,000 copies sold) and their two earlier albums, √áa parle au diable and Entre les branches both went gold (50,000 copies sold). In December 2006, En famille was certified double platinum (200,000 copies sold) and their album Tire-toi une b√ªche went gold after three weeks.

It is headquartered at the General Headquarters (Pakistan Army) in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Unlike the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the MI is composed entirely of uniformed Army officers and soldiers whose primary mission is to determine the military capability and any other information related to, military forces of hostile countries. Besides it is also tasked with gathering offensive counter-insurgency intelligence, identifying and eliminating sleeper cells, foreign agents and other anti-state elements within Pakistan, including investigation of military espionage. Historical overview The agency (MI) was created by Major General Robert Cawthom, who also served as its first Director. Major General Cawthom later established the ISI Directorate in the 1950s. Prior to the successful imposition of the coup d'√©tat against the government of President Major General (retired) Iskander Mirza, the MI's Director General Major General Syed Shahid Hamid reported to the then- Commander-in-Chief (Chief of Army Staff) Field Marshal Ayub Khan. The MI reported that Martial Law was promulgated in the entire country, both East- Pakistan and West-Pakistan. In the 1980s, MI's activities included operations in Sindh against the Pakistan Communist Party (CPP) and Indian intelligence operatives. The MI was also active during the Kargil war where Major General Jamshed Gulzar Kiani led a series of Intelligence-Based Operations (IBOs) against the enemy. However, the MI staged another coup d'√©tat against the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The MI played a significant and integral role in bringing General Pervez Musharraf, Chief of Staff of the Pakistan Army and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, to political power. Organization The MI works in coordination with Air Intelligence (AI) of the Pakistan Air Force and Naval Intelligence (NI) of the (Pakistan Navy). It reports to the DG MI. All the appointed officers and enlisted personnel are from the Army. MI is one of the five main intelligence services in Pakistan. It is tasked with monitoring the military capabilities of its adversaries, counter-espionage operations, identifying and eliminating sleeper cells and foreign agents; the MI also keeps a close eye on the activities of officers within the Pakistan Army.https://fas.org/irp/world/pakistan/mi/index.html The MI was headed by a Pakistan Army three-star general, Lieutenant General Syed Asim Munir Ahmed Shah .

The album is the soundtrack to the 1966 film The Family Way, directed by Roy Boulting and starring Hayley Mills. Produced and arranged by George Martin, the album was credited to \\"The George Martin Orchestra\\" and issued under the full title The Family Way (Original Soundtrack Album). \\\\- A 45rpm single, again credited to the George Martin Orchestra, was issued on 23 December 1966, comprising \\"Love in the Open Air\\" backed with \\"Theme from 'The Family Way'\\", as United Artists UP1165. The Family Way won an Ivor Novello Award in 1967. It was remastered and released on CD in 1996 with new musical compositions not on the original 1967 soundtrack album. Composition and recording McCartney and Martin began collaborating on the project in November 1966, shortly before The Beatles started work on their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. McCartney's contribution to the project was minimal, according to authors Howard Sounes and Steve Turner. McCartney composed a brief piano piece, which Martin then interpreted into several variations and arrangements, sufficient to produce 24 minutes of music. At McCartney's suggestion, one of the versions had a brass band arrangement, anticipating his production of the Black Dyke Mills Band's instrumental \\"Thingumybob\\" in 1968. Turner writes that, given the film's setting in northern England, the use of a brass band in the Family Way soundtrack might have been part of McCartney's inspiration for the fictitious Sgt. Pepper band, which McCartney termed \\"a bit of a brass band, in a way\\". A second composition was required for a pivotal love scene in the film. Quoting Martin's recollection, Sounes says that he had to \\"pester Paul for the briefest scrap of a tune\\" for this piece. Martin recalled that only after he had threatened to write the theme himself did McCartney comply, and that it was created on the spot at McCartney's home in St John's Wood, as Martin stood over McCartney at his piano. Titled \\"Love in the Open Air\\", the piece was \\"a sweet little fragment of a waltz tune\\", according to Martin. McCartney, who had initially been enthusiastic about the project, likened his subsequent lack of productivity to a type of writer's block. As a result of the delay, recording for the score did not begin until 15 December. The sessions took place over three days at CTS Studios in London. Members of the George Martin Orchestra included violinists Neville Marriner and Raymond Keenlyside, viola player John Underwood and cellist Joy Hall. Aside from the brass band, other musicians contributed on church organ and tuba. Although The Family Way was released in January 1967, most commentators consider George Harrison's Wonderwall Music (1968), also a film soundtrack, to be the first solo album by a member of the Beatles. Unlike with McCartney's film score, Harrison directed and produced the recordings for Wonderwall Music, in addition to playing on some of the album. CD release The soundtrack album was released on CD, in mono, in 2003. In 2011, a new remastered version of the soundtrack was released by Var√®se Vintage. It featured the 1967 score in the original sequence, remastered from the first-generation stereo master tapes. It also included the unreleased stereo mix of \\"A Theme from The Family Way\\" as a bonus track. This piece was originally issued as the B-side of the 1966 UK/US single by the Tudor Minstrels.

Formed in the year 1900, the club has a long-standing history of developing champion rowers, with a proud history filled with local, regional, national, international, and Olympic achievements. The club is governed by a member elected committee. The committee controls all aspects of the club. The most notable club champions, who have represented New Zealand at international rowing regattas such as the Commonwealth Games, the World Rowing Championships, and Olympics include Des Lock, Ian Boserio, Pat Abbott, Tim Logan and Viv Haar.  History  = International achievements = Petone club members have consistently been selected as New Zealand representatives since 1950. Jack McCarten was the first person to be selected, he represented New Zealand at the 1950 British Empire Games. Numerous more have been selected since then. In the 1970s the PRC enjoyed the greatest successes, in 1974 Des Lock represented New Zealand at the World Rowing Championships, Bill Vine represented New Zealand as the New Zealand Colts Manager, and a young Viv Harr represented New Zealand as a New Zealand Colt. In the 1975 World Rowing Championships the selection of a Petone person was repeated by Ian Boserio. Many Petone rowers hold world records for time trails at indoor racing events that are held all over the world. = Uniform = When the club was first formed the uniform was very different from the one we see today. It consisted of white trousers, a white cap with red buttons, a white singlet with a broad red sash, and a boater hat with a red band. By the 1960s the uniform had changed to gold singlets and black shorts. Currently the Petone uniform is fluorescent yellow singlets and black shorts. These colours are recognisable at any regatta. Hence Petone Rowing Club is world-famous in the rowing community of New Zealand. = Roll of Honour = World War I and World War II both had huge effects on most societies around the world. Petone Rowing Club was not excluded from this. Twenty one men fought in World War I from Petone rowing club. Four of these men lost their lives. Sixty-two men fought in World War II and seven of them lost their lives.

This is a small terrestrial species endemic to East Africa. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Proatheris superciliaris is a small species that averages 40 to 50 cm (about 16 to 20 inches) in total length (body + tail), with a maximum total length of . The females are slightly larger than the males.

US Govt. New York: Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . Geographic range It is found in East Africa. The southern part of its range begins near Beira, in central Mozambique, extends up north over the Mozambique Plain to Quissanga, and through Malawi and as far north as the floodplains of southern Tanzania at the northern end of Lake Malawi. The type locality given is \\"Terra Querimba\\" (= Quissanga mainland opposite Ilha Quirimba, Mozambique). Its range is apparently centered on the lower section of the Zambezi River and spreads out into the coastal plain of central Mozambique and the Shire Valley to Lake Chilwa and Malawi. However, other specimens have been found far from this region, such as in Cape Delgado Province, in north-eastern Mozambique, and Mwaya in south-western Tanzania. Habitat It is almost always found in low- lying marshes, floodplains and land frequently used for grazing cattle. The soil is never too dry, since this would make it difficult for the rodents that they feed on to dig their burrows. These snakes are entirely terrestrial and are usually found in or around these rodent burrows. Behaviour One of the distinguishing characteristics of the Atheris group (to which Proatheris is closely related), is that they have prehensile tails. With Proatheris, the young and subadults have this capability, but it is diminished in the adults. Feeding Preys mainly on small frogs and toads. Occasionally, it also feeds on small rodents. Reproduction This species is viviparous, with typically 3-16 neonates. Venom The first known case of a survivor of snakebite by this species was reported by Els (1988), involving a juvenile and 24-year-old victim penetrated by a single fang. The results were painful, but there were none of the strongly hemotoxic symptoms that had been associated with Atheris venom up to that point. In a second case in 1996, a victim experienced severe hemolysis and complete platelet destruction after which his liver and kidneys began to fail. When it was feared that the patient might die from hemolytic- uremic syndrome, plasmapheresis was performed. Luckily, the patient survived, but it is now obvious that P. superciliaris venom is very hemotoxic. Taxonomy This species was previously placed in the genus Atheris based on skull characteristics and because of its partially prehensile tail. Etymology The generic name, Proatheris, is Latin for \\"before-atheris\\". References Further reading *Boulenger, G.A. 1896. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History).

He was sent by Jinnah to Jammu and Kashmir in October 1947 shortly before the tribal invasion. He was arrested by Indian forces and jailed in Srinagar and finally repatriated in a prisoner exchange in 1949. He was the first elected president of Azad Kashmir. He was the founder of first Constitution of Azad Kashmir. Khurshid often wrote his name as simply \\"Khurshid\\", which was both his first name and last name. Indian sources often mistakenly write it as \\"Khurshid Ahmed\\".  Early life  Khurshid was born in Srinagar on 3 January 1924. His father was Maulvi Mohammad Hasan, a headmaster of a boys' school in Gilgit. Consequently, the early years of Khurshid's life were spent in Gilgit. He completed a bachelor's degree from the Amar Singh College in Srinagar. During his college years, he established Kashmir Muslim Students Federation and met Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Jalandhar for the first time in 1942.Nisar Thokar, KH Khursheed- the Kashmiri who fought along Jinnah, Greater Kashmir, 12 March 2008, Retrieved 23 January 2017 Khurshid also wrote for the weekly Javed started by the Muslim Conference leader Allah Rakha Sagar. Later he started working for the news agency Orient Press of India in Srinagar. When Jinnah went to Srinagar for a holiday in May 1944, Khurshid interacted with him as an agent of the Orient Press. Jinnah was impressed with him and hired him on his staff. Khurshid subsequently rose to be Jinnah's private secretary and watched the troubled political waters leading to the Partition of India from close quarters. Khurshid was married to Begum Sorayya, a stalwart in the struggle for the Pakistan Movement and a confidante of Fatimah Jinnah. Begum Sorraya is the renowned author of Memories of Fatimah Jinnah and the maternal cousin of Fawad Hasan Fawad. Missions to Kashmir Jinnah sent Khurshid on a mission to Kashmir in the summer of 1947. Jinnah wanted to holiday in Kashmir at this time but, given the pressure on him to accede to one of the incoming dominions, the Maharaja Hari Singh was no mood to entertain the request. Khurshid reportedly told the Maharaja that he was an independent sovereign and need not consult anybody regarding the accession of the state. If he acceded to Pakistan, he would not have to delegate any of his powers to Sheikh Abdullah. \\"Pakistan would not touch a hair of his head or take an iota of his powers.\\" Scholar Das Gupta also states that Khurshid stayed there for several months and created an atmosphere of communal frenzy against India. At the beginning of October 1947, Jinnah sent him to Kashmir again. The Maharaja had appointed Justice Mehr Chand Mahajan, with known connections to the Indian National Congress, as his prime minister, replacing the pro-Pakistan Ram Chandra Kak. Jinnah wanted to find out Maharaja's intentions. Khurshid reported back on 12 October stating that the Maharaja was \\"dead set against accession to Pakistan\\". He also reported that the pro-India National Conference was the only party in the state. The pro-Pakistan Muslim Conference was \\"essentially defunct\\". He concluded: In fact, Major Khurshid Anwar had already mobilised the Pashtun tribes from the Frontier for a raid on Kashmir and was poised to launch his attack on 15 October.: \\"In early October Khurshid Anwar came to Pindi and asked Syed Nazir Hussain Shah for four or five guides on the 12th of October to guide his five hundred men to the airfield in Srinagar. He claims that the original plan was to attack Muzaffarabad on the 15th of October.\\" When the tribal invasion was launched on 22 October 1947, Khurshid was still in the Valley. He was arrested on 2 November 1947 by the State Police, who recovered maps and documents from him. Indian sources say that Khurshid had gone underground and was attempting to organise an agitation against the state government from the Jama Masjid, the hub of activity for the Muslim Conference. Khurshid remained in custody until a prisoner exchange in 1949, after the Karachi Agreement was signed by India and Pakistan. Azad Kashmir politics K. H. Khurshid was appointed as President of Azad Kashmir on 1 May 1959 by Ayub Khan. He was, at first, reluctant to accept this office, but eventually did so at the insistence of Fatima Jinnah who is said to have treated him as her son and had also financially supported him earn the bar-at- law degree from Lincoln's Inn. As President, K. H. Khurshid conducted the first ever 'Basic Democracy' elections in Azad Kashmir and also won in this election as the President of Azad Kashmir. According to Dawn, \\"following some differences with the powerful Pakistani establishment, Mr Khurshid resigned from the office of AJK president on August 5, 1964.\\"  Death and legacy \\"K. H.

The building is located on Carrigrohane Road in the City of Cork. Although the building is owned by Cork County Council, it is located in a separate administrative area from the County - Cork City. At tall, the building was the tallest storied building in the country upon completion. However, it has since been surpassed by three other buildings. It is now a protected building. History Originally meetings of Cork County Council had been held in the back portion of the top floor of Cork Courthouse. By the 1950s these premises were becoming inadequate and work on a new purpose-built building, designed by Patrick McSweeney, the then Cork County Architect, started in 1965. It was officially opened in April 1968. Ois√≠n Kelly's statue, Two Working Men, stands outside the complex. Redevelopment A redevelopment project began in 2002 to re-clad the existing building, add a new storey to the tower block and build a six storey extension to the side of the tower. The original distinctive concrete facade had been severely eroded and it was decided to replace rather than repair this as part of an expansion scheme. A louvered glass cladding replaced the original concrete, and the six-storey extension at ground level was completed in June 2006, as well as a new concourse and council chamber. The redevelopment cost ‚Ç¨50 million.

He was a vice president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership and head of the Belzoni, Mississippi, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was assassinated in 1955 in retaliation for his efforts to register African Americans to vote. Since 1890 they had been effectively disenfranchised in Mississippi due to a new state constitution; other states across the South passed similar acts and constitutions, excluding millions of people from the political system and establishing one-party states. Biography Born in 1903, George Washington Lee grew up in poverty in Edwards, Mississippi. His mother was an illiterate plantation worker who married after Lee was born; his stepfather was abusive. After Lee's mother died when George was young, he was taken in by her sister. Lee graduated from high school, a rarity for blacks living in his circumstances. Afterward he went to the port of New Orleans, where he worked on the banana docks and took a correspondence course in typesetting. Lee was typical of a generation of activists who came to civil rights after they had made a success in business. Like so many in this category, he came up the hard way through backbreaking work, thrift, determination, and luck.David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, \\"The Grim and Overlooked Anniversary of the Murder of the Rev. George W. Lee, Civil Rights Activist\\", History News Network, May 6, 2005; accessed January 8, 2016. During the 1930s and the Great Depression, Lee accepted a call to become a preacher in Belzoni, Mississippi, where he led a Baptist congregation. The town was located in Humphreys County in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. Most blacks in the state lived in this region and the majority in extreme poverty as farm workers. Lee continued to work to improve himself; he joined with local black business and community leaders. Serving as pastor at four churches, he also opened a small grocery store. Lee considered both vocations as serving the African-American community. In a back room of his house, he and his wife, Rosebud, set up a small printing business. These efforts provided enough resources that Lee felt he had a base for entering the battle for civil rights in the early 1950s. As a part of the NAACP, Lee worked tirelessly in trying to register African Americans to vote. Activism Lee was the first black in memory to register to vote in Humphreys County, Mississippi (where blacks were a majority of the population but had been effectively disfranchised by provisions of the 1890 constitution, particularly due to white implementation of poll taxes and literacy tests). In 1953, Lee and Gus Courts, another black grocer, co-founded the Belzoni chapter of the NAACP. When the sheriff refused to accept their poll taxes, which were required for voter registration, they took him to court. Between them, Lee and Courts registered nearly all of the county's ninety black voters in 1955. Whites were enraged by the previous year's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court's in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), ruling that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. Whites in Mississippi were determined to resist efforts at integration, particularly in black-majority areas of the Delta. They founded the White Citizens Council, with chapters throughout counties in the Delta. Whites were aggressively purging the few blacks from the voting rolls through intimidation and economic pressure; in some places, they had black activists fired from their jobs and evicted from rental housing. Lee and Courts continued their work. Lee was a vice president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, a leading black organization in the state. The Council promoted self-help, business, and civil rights. It pressed for voting rights and social justice. It organized a boycott of gas stations that refused to install restrooms for blacks and was successful. The head of the Council was Dr. T. R. M. Howard, one of the wealthiest blacks in the state. Medgar Evers worked as an organizer; he was later state chair of the NAACP. In April, Lee spoke at the Council's annual meeting, which drew a crowd of more than 7,000 to the all-black town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Lee's \\"down-home dialogue and his sense of political timing\\" were said to have \\"electrified\\" the crowd. \\"Pray not for your mom and pop,\\" Lee suggested. \\"They've gone to heaven. Pray you can make it through this hell.\\"Simeon Booker, Jet, 1955. Death and investigation Less than a month after his famous speech, Lee was shot and killed while driving in his car in Belzoni, Mississippi. An unidentified shooter pulled alongside Lee's car and fired three times from a shotgun, shattering Lee's jaw and causing his car to leave the road. Lee died before arriving at a local hospital. According to the autopsy, lead pellets extracted from his face were consistent with buckshot. A few days before, Lee had received a threatening note. The sheriff, Ike Shelton, wanted to call the incident a traffic accident and close the case. He said the buckshot pellets were dental fillings torn loose by the impact of the crash. Howard, Evers and others demanded a thorough investigation. The sheriff and governor spurned them, but U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. ordered the Justice Department to look into the matter. Lee's funeral in Belzoni attracted reporters from major black newspapers. His widow Rosebud decided to have an open casket, to reveal how her husband had suffered. Emmett Till's mother would do the same a few months later after her teenage son was lynched. Readers of the Chicago Defender shared Rosebud Lee's outrage by viewing a photo of her husband's body. The NAACP-organized memorial service in Belzoni drew more than 1,000 attendees. Tensions were high in this small rural Delta town, as whites had long expected deference from the black majority. Howard and Roy Wilkins, the national president of the NAACP, shared the speakers' platform at Lee's funeral. Howard said that some blacks \\"would sell their grandmas for half a dollar, but Reverend Lee was not one of them.\\" Civil rights activists searched the Delta looking for evidence to find the killers. Medgar Evers reputedly \\"cut his teeth\\" on the Lee case, continually feeding information to the press. Despite the efforts of activists, interest began to wane, and the FBI investigation was eventually closed. Agents had identified credible white suspects, but said that potential witnesses appeared afraid to talk. No charges were ever brought against any suspect for Lee's murder. Legacy Lee's death captured national attention, highlighting the oppressive nature of Mississippi Jim Crow and the violence black residents had to face to exercise ordinary rights. In the state, Lee's death served as a catalyst for some activists to step up their efforts. Lee exemplified a generation of activists who used business success to build a platform to work as mature men on civil rights. He paved the way for other leaders to come up from the African-American community, and emphasized the power of the vote.

He won the case and emerged as an outstanding lawyer in India. In 1908, a number of Europeans, led by C. H. Harrison, who was then the Accountant-General of Bombay, formed a combination to break the power of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta in the Municipal Corporation of Bombay. This combination afterwards came to be popularly called the \\"caucus\\". Besides Harrison, it included Gell, the Police Commissioner, Sheppard, the Municipal Commissioner, and Lovat Fraser, the then editor of the \\"Times of India\\". Lovat Fraser was undoubtedly the most distinguished and gifted journalist who had ever come to India. He wielded a most powerful pen, vigorous and vitriolic; and in his day, the Bombay Times was a power and a terror in the country. He had already made fun of Pherozeshah in a powerful leader, at the time when Pherozeshah staged \\"a walk-out\\" from the Bombay Legislative Council, along with a number of other elected members of the Council, by way of protest against the Land Revenue Bill which government had introduced. I believe, this was the first instance of a political walk-out from the Indian Legislatures, which have become so ludicrously common nowadays. Pherozeshah was always returned to the Corporation from the constituency of Justices of the Peace, who were entitled to return sixteen corporators to the Municipality. The caucus put up sixteen candidates; and vigorous canvassing was made on their behalf by the caucus, so that all the caucus candidates may be elected, and Pherozeshah may be ousted. According to Setalvad, even Lowndes canvassed briskly for the caucus candidates in the Bombay Bar. When the result of the election was announced, these sixteen candidates got in; and Pherozeshah stood 17th, so that the caucus appeared to have achieved its object. However, as luck would have it, the last caucus candidate elected was one Suleman Abdul Wahed, who was a partner in the firm of Ludha Ibrahim & Co. This firm held large contracts from the Municipality. His election was thereupon challenged by Muhammad Ali Jinnah at the behest of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta before the Chief Judge of the Small Causes Court, who has jurisdiction over election petitions. Suleman Abdul Wahed was declared disqualified for serving as a member of the Corporation, with the result that Pherozeshah got in automatically; and all the elaborate plans of the caucus were upset. This abortive attempt to destroy Pherozeshah's domination in the Municipal Corporation resulted in enhancing his influence, popularity and prestige, both in the Corporation and with the public generally.

Doctor Pow treats super-criminals. After all her other leads give out, Farrell goes to the Bar with No Name, a bar for super-villains trying to get any resemblance to a lead she can muster up. Farrell is later approached by Hart and tells her what he remembers of the night of his wife's murder and directs her to the Tinkerer for the rest of the answers. The Tinkerer claims that he found a nearly lifeless Hart about three months previously and took him back to his lab to try and save his life. He was successful, but claims that he is not responsible for what can back with the judge. He claims that he wants Farrell to tell the world Michael Hart's story and to tell everyone that he is still seeking justice.

From 1929-1936, it had been included as a district of Van Province. The town of Ahlat is situated on the northwestern shore of Lake Van. The mayor is Abdulalim M√ºmtaz √áoban (AKP). History Ahlat, known by its Armenian name of Khlat in the ancient and medieval period, was once a part of the district of Bznunik'. The town was taken by the Arabs during the reign of Caliph Uthman (644‚Äì656); in 645, Uthman instructed the governor of Syria, Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, to send Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri in an expedition to Byzantine-controlled Armenia‚Äîalthough some sources insist that the Caliph commissioned Habib directly. During the next four centuries, Ahlat was ruled by \\"Arab governors, Armenian princes, and Arab emirs of the Qays tribe\\". In the early eighth century, Arab tribes settled in the region, and Ahlat became part of the Arab Kaysite principality.Ter-Ghewondyan, Aram N. The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia. Trans. Nina G. Garso√Øan. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1976, pp. 32, 144. Ibn Hawqal (died ca. 978) mentioned Ahlat as an important stopover point on the Urmia-Mayyafariqin trade route. In about 983, Ahlat was controlled by a Kurdish chief named \\"BƒÅ·∏è\\" (in Armenian spelled as \\"Bat\\"); thereafter, Ahlat was associated with the Kurdish Marwanids (centered in Diyar Bakr), which sprang from BƒÅ·∏è. In the winter of 998, the Curopalates David III of Tao besieged Khlat but was unable to capture it, partly because of his contemptuous treatment towards its Armenian population.Ter-Ghewondyan, 'The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia, pp. 113, 139. After the Battle of Manzikert (1071), the Seljuk army, led personally by Sultan Alp Arslan (1063-1072), took possession of the town. The Seljuks then gave control over the town to the Turkmen slave commander S√∂kmen el-Kutb√Æ (or al-Qutbi). S√∂kmen and his successors were known as the Shah-Armens (or Ahlat-Shahs) and made Ahlat their capital. In the 11th century accounts of Nasir Khusraw (in his Safarnama) the town of \\"Akhlat\\" (, ) is mentioned. According to the Institute of Ismaili Studies (who cite Thackston, W. Wheeler McIntosh, ed. trans., Nasir-i Khusraw‚Äôs Book of Travels (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 2010), 8.), the excerpt goes as follows: \\"From there (Harran) we arrived in the city of Akhlat on the 18th of Jumada al-Awwal [November 20 CE]. This city is the border town between the Muslims and Armenians, and from Bekri it is nineteen leagues. The Prince, Nasruddawla, was over a hundred years old and had many sons, to each of whom he had given a district. In the city of Akhlat they speak three languages: Arabic, Persian, and Armenian. It is my supposition that this is why they named the town Akhlat. Their commercial transactions are carried out in puls (possibly ancient Roman and Greek coins), and their rotel (Armenian money) is equivalent to three hundred dirhems.\\" With the decline of the Seljuks, and the new political upheaval presented by the invasions of the Khwarezmian Empire and the Mongol Empire, Ahlat became briefly disputed between the Ayyubids, the Kingdom of Georgia and the Sultanate of Rum (the Anatolian branch of the Seljuq dynasty). In the 12th century, Ahlat and its adjacent territory was conquered and vassalized by the Kingdom of Georgia. In this period the city was referred to by the Georgian name Khlati. Following the Battle of K√∂se Daƒü (1243) and the fall of Baghdad (1258), Ahlat, \\"together with eastern Anatolia and upper Mesopotamia\\", became part of the Mongol Empire. The Mongols added Ahlat to the Ilkhanate division, and in the ensuing period, the Ilkhanid rulers minted coins in Ahlat. According to Hamdallah Mustawfi (died 1349), the revenues provided by Ahlat under the Ilkhanids, amounted up to 51,500 dinars. After the Ilkhanate, Ahlat became part of the Jalayirids and then the Ak Koyunlu. In the early 16th century, the Ottomans expanded into Eastern Anatolia (Western Armenia), taking control of the town for the first time under Sultan Selim I (1512-1520). Nevertheless, Ahlat remained only loosely under Ottoman control at the time, for it was considered to be a border district between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire. In 1526, during the reign of king (shah) Tahmasp I (1524-1576), Ahlat was in Safavid hands, and its governor was Delu Montasha Ustajlu. In 1533, during the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War of 1532‚Äì1555, Ahlat was taken by the Ottoman army led by Grand Vizier Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha. In 1548, Ahlat was recaptured by the Safavids, who then sacked it. During Suleiman the Magnificent's reign (1520-1566), Ahlat eventually became a solid part of the Ottoman Empire. However, \\"in practise\\", Ahlat remained de facto under the control of various local Kurdish chiefs until the mid-19th century, when the central Ottoman government in Constantinople imposed direct rule on the town. Vital Cuinet estimated the population of Ahlat at end of the 19th century at 23,700. According to Cuinet, seventy percent were Muslims, whereas the rest were Christians, mostly Armenians. When Cuinet passed through the city during this time period, ancient Ahlat was considered to be \\"abandoned\\", and was referred to as Kharab ≈ûehir, i.e. \\"the ruined town\\". Later, a new town, which had a population of 5,018 in 1961, grew some two kilometers to the east on the shore of Lake Van. Ahlat today Ahlat and its surroundings are known for a large number of historic tombstones left by the Ahlatshah dynasty, also known as the Shah-Armen, Shah-i-Arman, or Ahlat-Shah dynasty. Efforts are presently being made by local authorities with a view to including The Tombstones of Ahlat the Urartian and Ottoman citadel on UNESCO's World Heritage List, where they are currently listed tentatively. In recent years, Ahlat also came to be known for the quality of its potatoes, which carved themselves a sizable share in the Turkish agricultural products market.

In keyboard instruments, the action is the mechanism that translates the motion of the keys into the creation of sound (by plucking or striking the strings). Keyboard instruments In a harpsichord, the main part of the action is a jack‚Äîa vertical strip of wood seated on the far end of the key. At the top of the jack is mounted a hinged tongue bearing a plectrum. When the key is pressed and the jack rises, the plectrum plucks the string. When the key is released and the jack falls back down, the tongue permits the plectrum to retract slightly, so that it can return to its rest position without getting stuck or plucking the string again on the way down. The jack also bears a damper, whose purpose is to stop the vibration of the string when the key is released. For full description and diagrams, see Harpsichord. In a piano, the action is a mechanical device, made mostly of hardwoods, that serves several purposes. By means of various levers, it translates a small motion of the key into a large motion of the hammers that strike the strings. The mechanics of the action also makes the hammer recoil from the string instantly, so as not to damp vibration, and also prevents the hammer from bouncing, striking the string multiple times. Piano actions, even in the original version invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori, tend to be quite complex and have been subject of ingenious inventions and refinements throughout their history. Different actions are used in grand and vertical pianos. For full discussion, including diagrams, see Action (piano) and piano. Instruments plucked by hand Ibanez RG 770 guitar action In the guitar and similar instruments, the action is the distance between the fretboard and the string, which determines how easy it is to sound notes when pressure is applied with the fingertips. Generally a low action is considered to be more playable, due to the lower amount of pressure needed to press the string to the fingerboard. However, if the action is set too low, the vibrating string might strike the fret or frets other than the one been fretted, creating unwanted buzzing. (On fretted instruments, this is known as fret buzz).) Conversely, if the action is too high, the strings may be too taut to fully depress. =Adjusting the action= On some instruments, such as certain guitars, the action can be adjusted by tightening screws at the bridge, which changes the height of the strings. Tune-o-matic bridges use small thumbwheels for this purpose‚Äîsometimes accompanied or replaced by flat- head screw fittings. On other instruments, changing the action is more difficult, involving the removal of entire pieces from the instrument. On a typical steel string acoustic guitar, for example, the action is adjusted by carefully sanding the guitar's saddle so that the strings sit closer to the fretboard.http://blog.zzounds.com/2017/07/11/setting-the-action-on-your- acoustic-guitar/ The action on a guitar is also slightly affected by the adjustment of the truss rod. Tightening the truss rod bends the neck backwards, lowering the action‚Äîand loosening the rod lets the neck bow forward, raising the action. Action on a guitar is usually measured at the 12th fret. Typically preferred action on an electric guitar is around 1/16\\" (1.6mm) on the high E string and 3/32\\" (2.4mm) on the low E string when in standard tuning using standard gauge strings. Sometimes a straight neck works best for guitar action, but many luthiers and musicians favor a slight forward bow‚Äîcalled the relief‚Äîto reduce buzzing by accommodating the shape of a vibrating string. Adjustment to the action should be done using all the aforementioned truss adjustments, in addition to modifying or adjusting any elements on the bridge of the guitar.

It is both licensed and published by Tokyopop. The style of its writing and illustration is heavily influenced by urban culture and the fantasy genre. While critical reception to Off Beat has been largely positive, with praise from sources like ForeWord Magazine, it has received some negative criticism for being a stylistic oddity among Japanese manga and OEL manga. Set in Queens, New York City, Off Beat follows the exploits of Christopher \\"Tory\\" Blake, a bright and disenfranchised fifteen- year-old who amuses himself by taking endless notes in a notebook about what he sees and hears each day. Usually a loner, Tory becomes infatuated with the boy who moves in next door in the middle of the night, and devotes all his time to learning what the new boy, Colin Stephens, is hiding. History While living in Queens, New York, Jennifer Lee Quick began drawing up ideas for Off Beat. A BFA in animation, she approached Tokyopop when the company was doing portfolio reviews for students and graduates at the School of Visual Arts. Originally, she had intended for the manga to be a joint project with her best friend, Becky Cloonan, but Quick was forced to fly solo due to conflicts with Cloonan's schedule. > \\"They liked what they saw, and asked me to send them a pitch sometime. At > the time, I was working on Once in a Blue Moon so I didn't have time to send > a pitch. When I finished that project, my long time best friend, Becky > Cloonan was contacted by Tokyopop to send a pitch proposal. I remembered > that I had been asked to send one as well, so we briefly considered sending > a joint proposal for Off Beat (at the time she had talked about possibly > working on the project with me). Her schedule got booked though, so I wasn't > sure about submitting the pitch on my own. She encouraged me to go ahead > though, so I went for it.\\" It was during September 2004 that Quick officially began working with Tokyopop on bringing Off Beat to shelves, having decided that there would only be three books in her series, making it the shortest story she has ever conceived. On the subject of her work, she has stated: > \\"I thought I would like to write a story that takes place in the city but > without trying to be gritty/edgy, or overly glamorized...Something kind of > everyday but a bit quirky and fun.\\" In an early conception of the story, all characters wore school uniforms. The names of the protagonists were selected arbitrarily, but their birthdates were meant to be somewhat methodical. The first chapter of Volume 1 was previewed in a 2005 edition of Tokyopop's quarterly Manga magazine (then known as Takuhai). A live presentation of the same chapter is also available through Tokyopop's Manga Online feature, Mangapods, though Quick herself denies being part of the project due to lack of communication. =Production= Off Beat is hand-drawn by Quick on Bristol paper with mechanical pencil, micron pens, India ink and brush. Initially, toning was done by hand, but issues with moir√© led Quick to screentone using Adobe Photoshop, with each page checked by her editor in light of persistent problems. While freelancing for Central Park Media, she found lettering with Adobe Illustrator frustrating, and opted to have Tokyopop's Vanessa Satone oversee the process for Off Beat instead. Themes and structure Numerous fantasy sequences appear throughout Off Beat. These panels from Volume 2 show Tory exploring new terrain during one of his daydreams. Much of Off Beat's tone is derived from its relation to urban culture. The fictional version of New York City that Quick has constructed is incredibly rich in detail, with attention to minuscule factors such as street addresses and subway/bus commute schedules. Often, the establishing shots of a scene will concentrate on landscape to capture in essence how a given area affects or portrays characters within that scene. Examples include shots of busy traffic and corner stores, Tory's messy room, and a dilapidated park. References are made to such problems as gang warfare, counterfeiting, illegal immigration, arms dealing, and terrorism in the form of bomb threats. Conspiracy theory and hacker subculture are also subjects that are explored. Editor Lillian Diaz-Przybyl has commented: > \\"It features a spot-on, great depiction of New York. Everything Fake does > wrong with setting, this does right. The location sets a brilliant backdrop > for a really great story with a smart Walter Mitty twist, and cute guys to > boot! It's truly manga with an American sensibility. The character designs > are unique and appealing, the romance is sweet and understated, and it > actually looks like Queens, which makes me really happy.\\" Off Beat is divided into chapters. Each volume is made up of six cumulative chapters (i.e. Chapter 6 carries over from Volume 1 into Chapter 7 at the beginning of Volume 2). Preceding the very first chapter of the series is a short prelude which establishes Tory's overanalytic attitude and motivation, with Chapter 1 leaping a time span of 347 days. In contrast to the prelude which looks back a full year, there is an epilogue at the end of Chapter 18 which takes a glance into the future for the main characters. Several chapter headings and pages not directly linked to the storyline make use of monochromatic versions of Off Beat illustrations that Quick has produced independent of her work on the manga. Plot Off Beat's story begins with Tory's first encounter with Colin. While out running errands, he catches Colin and Dr. Garrets as they move in across the street. Almost a year later, Tory convinces his mother to pull him from public school and send him to St. Peter's, where he expects to be more academically challenged. This is, however, merely an orchestration to get closer to Colin, who also happens to attend the same institution. While Tory generally has an over-active imagination, Colin truly has secrets to conceal. After bribing Paul into tracking down a license plate number for him, Tory discovers that Colin and his guardian are somehow connected to something known as the \\"Gaia Project,\\" which may or may not be responsible for episodes of sickness that the boy experiences. Behind the guise of a student council member, Tory offers peer tutoring sessions to students whose conduct is below what is considered acceptable, thereby dragging Colin into his scheme along with his newfound friend, Mandy. As their study sessions grow more frequent, Colin starts to treat Tory more like a friend. The boys pursue private outings, but their closeness indirectly results in Tory running into trouble with his mother, Paul, and Mandy, though they are ultimately reconciled when Tory admits to errors on his part. Paul's hard drive is mysteriously hacked, but key bits of information concerning the Gaia Project manage to be salvaged. In order to investigate just how much he has unearthed about the Project, Colin steals one of Tory's journals while dining at the Blake household. Puzzled as to why he is drawn to Tory, Colin attempts to determine whether or not Tory has \\"attunement\\" after collapsing in a caf√©, then proceeds to voice his own suspicions regarding the other's intentions in returning his journal. Volume 2 ends with Colin hitting Tory after Tory insists on working with him on the project. Colin's slap turns out to be a \\"time out\\" moment for the two and both boys go up to Colin's apartment. Colin is amazed at how his cats react so positively to Tory and the two boys start talking. At one point, Tory begins to see Colin in a new light and misspeaks, practically spilling the beans about feelings that, up until then, were not clear to him. Tory leaves frustrated and Colin has an idea about Tory's true intentions at this point. A steamy dream seals the deal for Tory and his feelings towards Colin are in focus... just in time for Colin to up and disappear with his guardian. A few weeks pass and Tory, now more curious, decides to see the newly available apartment with a real estate agent. He finds a plant left behind and starts to care for it. He also starts feeding Colin's cats who were left behind as well. Two days before Christmas, late in the afternoon, Colin comes back for his plant and is surprised to find it at Tory's. The boys, still unsure how to deal with all the discovery decide to try something... a kiss... Tory is most interested in contact information from Colin but Colin is not forthcoming, with the exception of a package of plant food labeled \\"Grow-Pak\\" and a hint about a new backer for the project. Colin leaves, telling Tory not to be bored, a subtle suggestion that Colin wants Tory to figure out where he's going. As Colin drives away, Tory is broken hearted, but starts to put the clues together in his journal to try to find out about \\"Grow-Pak\\" and where Colin went. In the epilogue, we see Tory a few years older starting a job at \\"Grow-Pak\\". The reader is then treated to what seems like the first meeting between Colin and Tory since the day they kissed. The book leaves us with an ambiguous \\"The End... ?\\" to let the reader decide how their relationship continues. Cast Christopher \\"Tory\\" Blake :Born August 26, 1990, and named after his hated father who left the family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a photographic memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself with the prospect of uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling to admit to himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the other boy. Colin Stephens :Born November 18, 1989 in South Africa to a British father and British Chinese mother, Colin is an extremely quiet, mysterious, and cold boy who moves into the apartment (346 68th St., Woodridge, Queens, New York) across the street from Tory, Saturday September 25, 2004, between 12:14 AM and 1:25 AM. His success in school is mediocre despite study, and he often skips classes, adding to his already poor reputation among teachers and students alike. He lives a secluded life, only leaving his home to go to church and to travel. He suffers from an ailment that causes intense coughing and shivering that may or may not be related to his involvement in the Gaia Project. Though he rejects Tory and Mandy's attempts to help him during a relapse of his condition, he eventually becomes close friends with the two during their peer tutoring sessions. He owns approximately seven cats. Amanda \\"Mandy\\" Townslan :An outgoing, popular, and gossipy girl at St. Peter's who is in the same science and P.E. classes as Tory and Colin. She has an affinity for withdrawn individuals, which leads her to befriend the two boys, always willing to lend a sympathetic ear. She has trouble in physics class, but does well in social studies and history. A vegetarian, Mandy supports animal rights and hopes to find a career in social services. She also enjoys meddling in Tory and Colin's relationship. Her two close friends, Amy and Mira, believe that she has strange tastes in regards to the boys she hangs out with. Mary Grace Blake :Tory's overprotective single mother. She is the head of the graphic design department of a small advertising agency where she works, and is the owner of the apartment duplex where she and her son live together. She is mild-mannered and does not become infuriated by the fact that Paul steals food from their fridge, but worries around the clock about her son. Paul Patterson :A blue- eyed college student who rents out the apartment above Tory's, Paul is the boy's only intellectual equal in some respects. He makes a living off graphic design, works towards a film major, and is obsessed with video games and internet porn. He is skilled with computers, able to hack files and write programs, often serving as Tory's means of collecting information on Colin. He pesters the boy for stalking Colin, but is repetitively met with defiance, which prompts him to take his leftovers. Dr. Dustin Garrets :Born and raised in Massachusetts, 1958, Dr. Garrets is the American cofounder and present leader of the Gaia Project (launched 1985), and Colin's guardian. He studied archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics at Birkbeck, and is retired from science, but met with Colin's parents before their deaths and continued his research, taking custody of the boy after their respective passings. He cares only for his work, disregards Colin's personal interests, discourages him from making friends or spending money on frivolous things, and prevents his expulsion from school through large monetary donations. Shortly before moving across the street from Tory, Dr. Garrets was interrogated by police after an anonymous report claimed that he was in illegal possession of equipment, though charges were dismissed. Reception Off Beat has been generally well received by readers. It has received praise for its unique style of art and humour, slow unraveling plot, and has been described as \\"a wildly imaginative romantic drama, filled with all the hopes, dreams and anxiety of a teenager trying to make sense of his place in the world.\\" Readers find Off Beat's setting especially appealing, feeling that Quick has effectively crafted a \\"pure U.S. city\\" which has lent itself to a distinct American characterization despite influences from conventional modes of Japanese manga. Conversely, a minority of critics has dismissed these aspects as disorienting when compared to other manga, but nonetheless find redeeming qualities in the story and character development. In 2005, Off Beat was awarded a silver medal for Best Graphic Novel from ForeWord Magazine. Books * Off Beat Volume 1. (published September 13, 2005) * Off Beat Volume 2.

Etymology The genus name translates as \\"true cycloid goby\\", referring to the scales, while the species epithet is in honor of J. S. Newberry (1822-1892), an American geologist, physician and explorer, who collected fishes for the species species describer, Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard, just not this species. Description A small fish, only rarely longer than 5 cm (2 in), the northern tidewater goby is elongate with a blunt tail. Color is a mottled gray, brown, or olive; living fish are translucent or mostly transparent. Tidewater gobies, like many fish, exhibit countershading and tend to be mottled slightly darker on the dorsal side. The upper part of the first dorsal fin is clear or cream-colored, while the second dorsal is longer than the first, and close in size to the anal fin. The large mouth extends back to or past the posterior edge of the eye, and is angled upwards. The eyes are spaced far apart. Unusually among gobies, the scales are cycloid instead of ctenoid; they are always absent from the head, and often from the underside too. Breeding individuals will demonstrate color changes, with the males becoming more black with white spots as females become tan or reddish-brown with golden or dark-brown sides. Females may also take on a darker color while fighting. Similar fish include the longjaw mudsucker, which can be distinguished from the northern tidewater goby by its more horizontal mouth and shorter rays in the anal fin compared to the 2nd dorsal fin. Distribution and habitat Their range extends from Tillas Slough at the mouth of the Smith River in Del Norte County, California, south to Agua Hedionda Lagoon in San Diego County. While once recorded in at least 87 coastal locations, they are now gone from many, including San Francisco Bay. Despite the common name, this goby inhabits lagoons formed by streams running into the sea. The lagoons are blocked from the Pacific Ocean by sand bars, admitting salt water only during particular seasons, and so their water is brackish and cool. The northern tidewater goby prefers salinities of less than 10 ppt. Juveniles have been found as far upstream as 12 km, e.g. in Ten Mile River, Mendocino County, and San Antonio Creek and the Santa Ynez River, Santa Barbara County, sometimes in sections of stream impounded by California Golden beavers (Castor canadensis subauratus) which provide ideal slow-moving water habitat for northern tidewater gobies. These fish also prefer sandy bottoms with depths of 20‚Äì100 cm, near emergent vegetation beds. The northern tidewater goby may be found in small groups of less than a dozen or occasionally in large aggregations of hundreds. Behavior and Reproduction Male northern tidewater gobies burrow into sand and mud in the spring, cementing together grains of sand with a mucous, and shutting the burrow off from the waters above with a mucous and sand plug. Females will become aggressive during the spring and fight over a potential mate, slapping each other with their tails and biting when posturing is insufficient to drive their rivals away. The female will then attempt to entice the male to open his burrow. If the female is successful (which may be infrequent - Camm Swift reports that 23 observed courtships resulted in only a single successful entry into the burrow by the female,) she will lay eggs on the burrow's sides and roof. The male protects the eggs for 9‚Äì10 days before they hatch. Although their life expectancy is not well known, tidewater gobies may live for only a year. Conservation status National Park Service biologist releasing tidewater gobies in Tomales Bay as part of a restoration program. The northern tidewater goby was listed by the state of California for protection in 1987, and federally listed in 1994. However, there has been some controversy over this, since many populations in its range are apparently secure, and the fish is even abundant at times. However, the fish's need for specific kind of habitat means that the populations are isolated from each other, and subject to extirpation due to various human activities, such as draining of wetlands, sand bar breaches for the purpose of tidal flushing, pollutant accumulation in lagoons, and so forth. Even so, studies have shown that it is a resilient species, and populations have been successfully restored to wetlands that have been protected.

Born in Connecticut, he had migrated as a child with his parents to Georgia, where he grew up. After working as a journalist and attorney, he was elected to the state senate. He prepared A Digest of the Laws of the State of Georgia (1822), for 30 years the most important collection of the laws. In 1830 Prince left the law to become editor of the Georgia Journal, returning to early work in journalism. With his multi-faceted career, he was describe as \\"one of the brilliant figures of Georgia in the first half of the nineteenth century\\". He and his wife died on October 9, 1837 in the wreck of the SS Home, grounded near Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, during Racer's Storm. This was the first hurricane recorded as attacking both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Early life, education and marriage Born in Montville, Connecticut in 1787, Oliver Hillhouse Prince completed his first studies locally. In 1796 he moved with his parents to Georgia, where they settled in Washington, Wilkes County. His mother's Hillhouse family included ancestors who were judges and her brother James Hillhouse was a US Senator. Oliver's maternal uncle David Hillhouse had already settled in the state when his parents moved there.Men of Mark in Georgia, Volume 2, edited by William J. Northen, John Temple Graves, Georgia: A. B. Caldwell, 1910/1974 reprint Prince later engaged in newspaper work as an assistant editor for The Monitor, a Wilkes County newspaper, from 1803 to 1806. Tradition has it that Prince wrote many humorous articles as a young man during this period. But in files of the Monitor, there are no humorous articles attributed to Prince. In fact, nowhere in the surviving issues of the paper is there any other item that might fairly be described as a \\"humorous sketch.\\" However, he was described by 20th-century historians as \\"remarkably gifted with the literary instinct which he possessed with the most delicious sense of humor.\\"Kenneth Coleman and Charles Currin, editors, Dictionary of Georgia Biography (1983) At the same time, he \\"read the law.\\" At age 19 in 1806, he gained admission to the bar by special act of the legislature, as he was under age. He began his practice in Macon. In 1817 Prince married Mary Ross Norman of Lincoln County, Georgia, who was eighteen,Donald E.

Their first two children died young in 1822, and they moved to newly established Bibb County, Georgia. They had three more children: Virginia (b. 1825), another daughter and son Oliver H. Prince, Jr. Legal and political career Prince became active in politics as an adult. As an attorney, he traveled around Georgia's Northern Circuit for 16 years with circuit judges for court sessions in log cabins and other makeshift sites throughout the state. His work helped him establish a broad network. In 1819 he was commissioned by the state legislature to compile a digest of Georgia law. After two years of research and work, he produced A Digest of the Laws of the State of Georgia (1822). It quickly was put into use and is considered a classic, filled with notes, a list of repealed statutes and a valuable discussion of habeas corpus. A second and larger edition was published in 1837 after his death. His work was considered a landmark achievement. It was the \\"most important collection of Georgia laws until 1851,\\" when Thomas R.R. Cobb published a new compilation. In early 1823 Prince was one of five commissioners selected to lay out the town of Macon. He was elected to the State senate in 1824. In 1828 he was elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Thomas W. Cobb. He served from November 7, 1828 to March 3, 1829 as a Jacksonian Democrat, supporting the president in the Indian Removal Act of 1830. This authorized the government to remove the tribes especially from the Southeast to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. All the Five Civilized Tribes were affected in this removal, and they lost many members in the harsh conditions of their journeys. Later years Prince later worked again as an editor. He presided over the first railroad convention in Georgia, and was one of the first stockholders and directors of the Georgia Railroad, critical to developing infrastructure in the state. He abandoned the practice of law in 1832 and moved with his wife to Milledgeville, then the state capital. He purchased and became the editor of the Georgia Journal, an influential newspaper. He sold the journal in 1835, retiring with his family at the age of 48 to a 450-acre farm he bought in Athens, Georgia. Their son Oliver, Jr. attended a preparatory school in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Prince and his wife left in May 1837 for a trip to New York and Boston, where he worked with his publisher for some months preparing the second edition of his Law Digest for publication. They missed their children and were looking forward to their return. After sailing from New York on October 7, 1837, both Prince and his wife died in the wreck of the steam packet ship SS Home, which was caught in Racer's Storm, a destructive hurricane that hit both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Although the ship had been converted for ocean going, it carried only three lifeboats and two life preservers. It grounded near Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina on October 8, 1837 and broke up the next day. The ship was 537 tons, 220 feet long and 22 feet wide. The remains of the estimated 90 victims, mostly women and children, were never recovered. Years later, the three Prince children erected a cenotaph in Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon in their parents' honor. Legacy and honors *Prince's most famous sketch was published anonymously in The Monitor on June 6, 1807, but it was reprinted, translated into several foreign languages, and published in Augustus Baldwin Longstreet's Georgia Scenes (1835), which went through several editions in the 19th century. Most famously, the sketch of Captain Clodpole and his Georgia militia recruits is believed to have been plagiarized by the British author Thomas Hardy in his The Trumpet Major (1888), in a chapter on an English rural militia. Such charges were ignored and then denied by Hardy but critics think the similarities are too strong to be coincidence. *In 1859 Prince Avenue, the section of the Federal Road west of downtown in Athens, Georgia, was named for him. It had led from town to his plantation.

He is a younger brother of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud, the resistance leader against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and against the Taliban. In late 2011, Ahmad Zia Massoud joined hands with major leaders in the National Front of Afghanistan, which strongly opposes a return of the Taliban to power. The National Front is generally regarded as a reformation of the United Front (Northern Alliance) which with U.S. air support removed the Taliban from power in late 2001. Biography Ahmad Zia Massoud was born on May 1, 1956, in Muqur, which is in the Ghazni province of Afghanistan. He attended the Lyc√©e Esteqlal in Kabul. In 1976, he was admitted to the Polytechnical University of Kabul where he studied for three years. Caught up in the tumultuous events in the country after the communist Saur Revolution he left the university and joined the mujahideen led by his brother Ahmad Shah Massoud in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul. From 1978 to 1981, Ahmad Zia directed the resistance forces of Paryan in Haut-Panjsher. Between 1981 and April 1992, his commander and brother Ahmed Shah Massoud named him special representative of the Jamiat-e-Islami party to Peshawar, Pakistan, where the seven principal parties of the Afghan resistance met. During this period he maintained and increased contacts with political leaders of all the Afghan resistance movement, including diplomatic circles and international organizations. He also traveled abroad to make the case for the mujahideen. After the fall of the Soviet-backed communist regime, Burhanuddin Rabbani, his father-in-law, chose him to be an advisor and special representative of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Taliban eventually took power in Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Ahmad Zia Massoud joined the anti-Taliban United Islamic Front led by his brother Ahmad Shah Massoud. In the late 1990s, Ahmad Zia Massoud continued his political and diplomatic activities, working to raise the profile of Afghanistan on the international stage, and to call attention to the horrors of the Taliban. In December 2001, after the fall of the Taliban regime, President Hamid Karzai named him ambassador to the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin. In February 2004 Ahmad Zia's functions were extended to include the Republic of Armenia, and then in July of that year, Belarus, and Moldova as well. He is the First Deputy of Zalmai Rassoul in Afghanistan Presidential elections of 2014. On July 26, 2004, Karzai announced that he had chosen Ahmad Zia Massoud as his running mate over Defense Minister Mohammad Qasim Fahim in the October 9, 2004 presidential elections. While campaigning in the 2004 elections a bomb was detonated at a political rally of Massoud in the northern Afghan city of Feyzabad. Two people were killed but Massoud emerged unscathed. After several political disputes between Ahmad Zia Massoud and Hamid Karzai, the two men parted ways. In the 2009 presidential elections Karzai ran on an election ticket with Mohammad Qasim Fahim instead. In December 2009 another bomb blast is believed to have targeted Ahmad Zia Massoud. He emerged unharmed while 8 people were killed and 40 wounded.Associated Press: Afghans Say 8 Dead in Suicide Blast. A car bomb blast in the Afghan capital tuesday killed at least 8 people and wounded 40, according to the Interior Ministry. Security officials think former vice-president Ahmad Zia Massoud may have been the target. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e97ECBBJ_mU National Front of Afghanistan Ahmad Zia Massoud as Vice President of Afghanistan shaking hands with a U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Team at the ceremony for a new road. In late 2011, Ahmad Zia Massoud united major political anti-Taliban leaders in the National Front of Afghanistan, which strongly opposes a return of the Taliban to power. The National Front retains significant military capabilities. U.S. Congressman Louie Gohmert wrote, \\"These leaders who fought with embedded Special Forces to initially defeat the Taliban represent over 60-percent of the Afghan people, yet are being entirely disregarded by the Obama and Karzai Administrations in negotiations.\\" In January 2012, Ahmad Zia Massoud, Abdul Rashid Dostum, leader of the Uzbek-dominated Junbish-i Milli, Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, one leader of the Hazara Shia Hezb-e Wahdat, and Amrullah Saleh, former director of the Afghan intelligence service NDS and leader of the Basij-e Milli, came together in a meeting with US congressmen in Berlin and signed a joint declaration: The Asia Times writes: \\"This is the first time that the leadership of the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara communities [of Afghanistan] has come to a common line of thinking ... In essence, the Northern Alliance is being resuscitated as a political entity. ... As the Northern Alliance groups see it, Pakistani strategy is to wait out the period between now and 2014 - the date set for the US troop withdrawal - and then regroup the Taliban and make a bid to capture power in Kabul. Their strong show of unity in Berlin suggests that they will not roll over and give way to an exclusive US-Taliban-Pakistan settlement being imposed on their nation.\\" 2014 Presidential Elections In the 2014 Presidential elections Ahmad Zia Massoud ran with then Foreign Minister Dr. Zalmai Rassoul in the 2014 Afghan presidential election. During the second round of the election he endorsed candidate Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. Publicly they had signed an agreement that Ahmad Zia Massoud would hold the position of Chief Executive Officer under Ghani's administration. However, with the difficulties during the second round of the election between the two presidential candidates Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Ahmad Zia Massoud stepped aside leaving the position of Chief Executive Officer to Dr. Abdullah Abdullah who had demanded the same position after losing the race. Currently Ahmad Zia Massoud holds the position of The Special Representative of the President of Afghanistan in Reform and Good Governance. Personal Ahmad Zia Massoud is married to a daughter of Burhanuddin Rabbani. They have four children: three girls and a boy.

He is most famous for his 1885 English translation of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote de la Mancha, perhaps the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time. It is so precise that Samuel Putnam, who published his own English translation of the novel in 1949, faults Ormsby for duplicating Cervantes' pronouns so closely that the meaning of the sentences sometimes becomes confusing. Life He was born at Gortner Abbey, co. Mayo, on 25 April 1829, was the eldest son of George Ormsby (died 1836), a captain in the 3rd dragoons and high sheriff of co. Mayo in 1827, and his wife Marianne, third daughter of Humphrey Jones of Mullinabro, co. Kilkenny. He was a direct descendant of the Ormsby family which migrated from Lincolnshire to co. Mayo in the reign of Elizabeth. On the death of both parents during his childhood, he was placed under the guardianship of Denis Brown, dean of Emly. He was educated at Dr. Roman's private school at Seapoint, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1843, and he won a silver medal for chemistry at the University of London in 1846. Two years later, he was admitted at the Middle Temple, but he was never called to the bar. His literary tastes were developed early, and he contributed papers of travel to Fraser's Magazine, to the Saturday Review, and to the early numbers of the Cornhill and the Pall Mall Gazette. He lived at this period in King's Bench Walk in the Temple, a 'denizen of Bohemia, but of the cultivated and scholarlike Bohemia,' and his friends often remarked that he would be an 'excellent representative of Warrington in \\"Pendennis.\\"' He was extremely well read in eighteenth-century literature, and especially in Defoe, Fielding, and Boswell. He was a member of the Alpine Club almost from its inauguration in 1858. He was one of the first party to climb the Pic de Grivola in August 1859, and he contributed an amusing paper on 'The Ascent of the Grivola' to the second volume of the second series of Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers, by members of the Alpine Club (1862). In 1864, he published Autumn Rambles in North Africa, travel sketches from La Grande Kabylie and Tunis during 1863‚Äì4, originally contributed for the most part to Fraser, with illustrations by the author. In 1876, he collected in volume form his Stray Papers, including some amusing pieces, 'Sandford and Merton,' 'Mme. Tussaud's,' and 'Swift on the Turf.' In 1879, he published a translation from Spanish of the Poem of the Cid, dedicated to Pascual de Gayangos. His translation of Don Quixote Ormsby's translation has seen more editions than any other nineteenth-century English version of the novel, having been included in the Heritage Book Club series of great novels, and in the Great Books of the Western World set. The contemporaneous translations by Alexander James Duffield (1881) and Henry Edward Watts (1888) have been virtually forgotten. Ormsby not only translates the novel; he provides a long and informative introduction with a brief analysis of all the major English versions of \\"Don Quixote\\" up to then (except for the Duffield version), as well as explaining the conceptual choices that he himself made in translating the novel, in terms of affectation, for example, or using the simplest everyday language. He also features a short biography of Cervantes in his introduction, as well as providing his own controversial analysis of the work. Ormsby refutes the widely accepted view that \\"Don Quixote\\" is a sad novel with allegorical meanings and a pessimistic philosophy, and states that because Cervantes himself declared it to be a satire against books of chivalry, it is primarily only that, although it does contain much observation on human character. Ormsby also refutes, in addition, the commonly held view that Don Quixote is an innately noble person, stating that his nobility of character is an attitude that he assumes simply to imitate his knightly heroes. An 1886 edition of the Quarterly Review, published only a year after Ormsby's translation was first issued, took him to task for his limited interpretation of the novel and of Don Quixote's character, while praising the accuracy of the translation. Even while referring to Don Quixote as a \\"great classic\\", Ormsby was far from an unquestioning admirer of Cervantes's work, at times criticizing the author's writing habits and linguistic style. He wrote, for example: ‚ÄúNever was great work so neglected by its author. That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not always his fault, but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the press.‚Äù.His preface to the book ‚Äì for this quote, see II: About Cervantes and Don Quixote He wrote two versions of his introductory analysis, a longer version published in the original 1885 edition of his translation, in which he severely criticized Cervantes's writing style, and a more concise version (the one published in most editions of the translation), in which some of the criticisms have been omitted. Ormsby also provided his own footnotes for his translation. They are usually missing in Internet versions of his translation. A revised version of Ormsby's translation, by Kenneth Douglas and Joseph Jones, with new introduction and notes, was published by W.W. Norton in 1981 ().

First released as Professional Composer among early Macintosh software in 1984, the application introduced a user interface similar to the word processor. The main features included entering musical notation, printing sheet music, and support for lyrics under the score with the font of choice. Notes could be selected from the user interface or entered from the keyboard. The user could also change or extend the tempo, key signature, meter, and other parameters. The next major release, Professional Composer 2.0, supported writing on up to 40 staves and allowed the user to enter notes as short as 128th notes, with all operations mainly controlled by menus and dialog boxes. Version 2.0 also introduced several improvements for printing (such as automatically condensing parts with several rest measures), allowing production of professional quality scores. Although the application demanded knowledge of music theory to use its rich features, it offered only rudimentary playback capabilities. A Macworld review also criticized the high price (US$495 in February 1986) and the lack of automatic scrolling when staves were filled (only via scroll bars). Version 2.2 (1988) corrected several bugs and improved compatibility with Mac Plus, SE and II. Version 2.3M was the last release of Professional Composer. Mosaic entered the market in 1992 as the successor to Professional Composer. An early user review of version 1.01 criticized stability issues and problems with file importing from other applications. In version 1.58 released in 1998, the notation software removed all limits on page size, score length, number of staves, and number of voices per staff. Configuration options in different windows created a flexible but sometimes confusing user interface. Drag and drop features and ability to convert MIDI files into usable notation were counted among the strongest points of Mosaic.

Biography John Ormond Thomas was born on 3 April 1923 in Wales, at Dunvant, near Swansea. He studied philosophy and English at Swansea University, and at the same time studied painting at the Swansea School of Art. His early verse appeared in various periodicals, including Poetry Folios as Ormond Thomas. As John Ormond Thomas, his work appeared with that of James Kirkup and John Bayliss in Indications (1943), published by the Grey Walls Press. After graduation in 1945, on the strength of a portfolio of poems sent to the editor Tom Hopkinson, he was offered a three-month trial at Picture Post in London, after which he was made a staff writer. He returned to Swansea in 1949, as a sub-editor on the South Wales Evening Post. During this time, friendships forged with Daniel Jones, Vernon Watkins, Alfred Janes and other members of Dylan Thomas's Kardomah gang, including Thomas himself, would be a formative influence. However, Watkins' advice that he should not publish a further collection until he was 30 made him hyper-critical of his own poetry. He also destroyed much of it. In January 1955, Tom Hopkinson, now features editor of the News Chronicle, invited him to write verses for the Saturday Picture. Publishing these as John Ormond, thus establishing that as his professional name, he continued to contribute weekly verses for two and a half years. In July 1955 Ormond began a career with BBC Wales in Cardiff, working with the fledgling news-service. In 1957 he became head of the BBC Welsh Film Unit where in due course he began his first documentaries. The success of Borrowed Pasture (1960), his portrait of two Polish exiles struggling to eke out a living on a derelict farm in Carmarthenshire, immediately established him as a film-maker. It is still regarded as a classic of its time. In 1961, he was appointed as a director and producer of documentary films, which included studies of Ceri Richards, Kyffin Williams, Dylan Thomas, Alun Lewis and R. S. Thomas. Ormond 'returned' to poetry in the mid-1960s, publishing in the periodical Poetry Wales. His first major volume, Requiem and Celebration, was published in 1969. His reputation was enhanced in 1973 by the appearance of Definition of a Waterfall and his inclusion in Penguin Modern Poets. A volume of selected poems was published in 1987.

P. Lovecraft in 1920. The themes of the story are tainted ancestry, knowledge that it would be best to remain unaware of, and a reality which human understanding finds intolerable. Plot A chart depicting the genealogy of the Jermyn family in the story. The story begins by describing the ancestors of Sir Arthur Jermyn, a British nobleman. His great-great-great-grandfather, Sir Wade Jermyn, had been an early explorer of the Congo region, whose books on a mysterious white civilization there had been ridiculed. He had been confined to an asylum in 1765. Lovecraft describes how the Jermyn family has a peculiar physical appearance that began to appear in the children of Wade Jermyn and his mysterious and reclusive wife, who Wade claimed was Portuguese. Wade's son, Philip Jermyn, was a sailor who joined the navy after fathering his son, and disappeared from his ship one night as it lay off the Congo coast. Philip's son, Robert Jermyn, was a scientist who made two expeditions into the interior of Africa. He married a daughter of the (fictional) 7th Viscount Brightholme and fathered three children, two of which suffered from severe disabilities, but the middle one of whom, Nevil Jermyn, had a son, Alfred, who was Arthur Jermyn's father. In 1852, Robert Jermyn met with an explorer, Samuel Seaton, who described \\"a grey city of white apes ruled by a white god\\". Robert killed the explorer after hearing this, as well as all three of his children. Nevil Jermyn managed to save his son, Alfred, before his death. Robert was put in an asylum and, after two years, died there. Alfred Jermyn grew up to inherit his grandfather's title, but abandoned his wife and child to join a circus, where he became fascinated with a gorilla \\"of lighter colour than the average\\". He became its trainer, but was killed in Chicago after an incident in which he attacked the gorilla and the latter fought back. Arthur Jermyn inherited the family possessions, and moved into Jermyn House with his mother. Arthur Jermyn is described as having a very unusual appearance, and supposedly the strangest in the line descended from Sir Wade Jermyn. Arthur became a scholar, eventually visiting the Belgian Congo on a research expedition, where he heard tales of a stone city of white apes and the stuffed body of a white ape goddess, which had since gone missing. Returning to a trading post, Arthur talks to a Belgian agent who offers to both obtain and ship the goddess's body to him. Arthur accepts his offer, and returns to England. After a period of several months, the body arrives at Jermyn House. Arthur begins his examination of the mummy, only to run screaming from the room, and later commit suicide by dousing himself in oil and setting himself alight. Lovecraft then describes the contents of the stuffed goddess's coffin‚Äîthe ape goddess has a golden locket around her neck with the Jermyn arms on it, and bears a striking resemblance to Arthur Jermyn. It is clear that Wade Jermyn's supposedly Portuguese wife was really the ape goddess, and all of his descendants were the product of their union. Arthur's remains are neither collected or buried, on account of this. The mummy is removed and burnt by the Royal Anthropological Institute. Inspiration Both of Lovecraft's parents died in a mental hospital, and some writers have seen a concern with having inherited a propensity for physical and mental degeneration reflected in the plot of his stories, especially his 1931 novella, The Shadow Over Innsmouth, which shares some themes with Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family.Ronan (n√©e Sylvester), Margaret, Forward to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and Other Stories of Horror, Scholastic Book Services, 1971 As in many of his stories, the mind of a character deteriorates as his investigations uncover an intolerable reality, a central tenet of Cosmicism which Lovecraft outlines in the opening sentence of The Call of Cthulhu: \\"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\\"HP Lovecraft, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" (1928). In a letter, Lovecraft described the impetus behind Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family: =Publishing history and possible influences= The story was first published in the journal The Wolverine in March and June of 1921. To Lovecraft's distaste, the story was retitled \\"The White Ape\\" when it appeared in Weird Tales in 1924; he commented: \\"If I ever entitled a story 'The White Ape', there would be no ape in it\\".The Call of Cthulhu and Other Dark Tales 2009 Barnes and Noble, page 12 Subsequent reprintings titled it \\"Arthur Jermyn\\" until the corrected publishing in Dagon and Other Macabre Tales in 1986. Critic William Fulwiler suggests that the plot of \\"Arthur Jermyn\\" may have been inspired by Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels The Return of Tarzan (1913) and Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (1916), in which the lost city of Opar is \\"peopled by a hybrid race resulting from the matings of men with apes.\\"William Fulwiler, \\"E.R.B. and H.P.L.\\", Black Forbidden Things, Robert M. Price, ed., pp. 64-65. E.F. Bleiler, too, has commented that it \\"undoubtedly owes much to Edgar Rice Burrough's Opar in his Tarzan series\\".E.F. Bleiler, \\"H.P.

The killings sparked a number of legal and legislative actions that were precursors to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, H.R.3355, 103rd Congress. The Act took effect in 1994 and expired in September 2004 after the expiration of a sunset provision. Shootings At 2:57 p.m. 55-year-old failed entrepreneurLambert, Pam. (19 July 1993) Falling Down. People. Gian Luigi Ferri (born December 29, 1937, as Gianluigi Ettore Ferri) entered an office building at 101 California Street in San Francisco, and made his way to the offices of the law firm Pettit & Martin on the 34th floor. Ferri's reason for targeting that particular firm is unknown. (Though Ferri had just weeks earlier expressed his strong grudge against lawyers in general when asked by Los Angeles barber Keith Blum, \\"If you were locked in a room with Saddam, the Ayatollah Khomeini and a lawyer, and you had a gun with two bullets in it, who would you shoot?\\". Ferri, who had heard the gag before, replied, \\"The lawyer‚Äîtwice.\\")https://people.com/archive/falling-down- vol-40-no-3/ Ferri at the barbers - Falling Down P&M; redirected him to alternative legal counsel about some real estate deals in the Midwest in 1981, and had no contact with him in the 12 years since. They could not advise him on matters out of state. After exiting an elevator, Ferri donned a pair of ear protectors and opened fire with a pair of TEC-9 handguns and a Norinco NP44 (a Chinese-manufactured copy of the Colt M1911 pistol with a double-stack magazine). He reportedly used a mix of Black Talon hollow point and standard ammunition, and used Hell-Fire trigger systems for the TEC-9 pistols. After roaming the 34th floor, he moved down one floor through an internal staircase and continued shooting. The attack continued on several floors before Ferri committed suicide as San Francisco Police closed in. Eight people were killed in the attack, and six others injured.http://www.zpub.com/sf/1993/gun1.gif The reason for the shootings was never fully determined. A typed letter left behind by Ferri contained a list of complaints,http://www.zpub.com/sf/1993/gun5.jpg but the letter was largely unintelligible. Four single spaced pages in length, the letter contained many grammatical errors, misspellings and was typed in all caps. Ferri claimed he had been poisoned by monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer in food, and that he had been \\"raped\\" by Pettit & Martin and other firms. The letter also contained complaints against the Food and Drug Administration, the legal profession (which he claimed gave \\"allegiance to the monarchy\\"), and a list of over 30 \\"criminals, rapists, , lobbyists\\", none of whom were among his actual victims.Seeking Motive in the Killing of 8: Insane Ramblings Are Little Help. The New York Times. (4 July 1993). Pettit & Martin occupied floors 33 (partial floor) and 34 through 36. The main reception floor was 35 and Ferri intended that floor as a target. His elevator stopped at the 34th floor because a secretary from that floor had pushed the up button for an elevator. As a result, Ferri began shooting on the 34th floor and worked his way down to lower floors.

Reaction The shootings spurred calls for tighter gun control and were followed by a number of legal and legislative actions. California implemented some of the toughest gun laws in the United States. The state also repealed a law that had given gun manufacturers immunity against lawsuits after an attempt by some relatives of 101 California Street victims to sue the companies that made the weapons Ferri used. The incident also spurred the installation of security measures now common in most office buildings. Prior to the attack, it was possible for anybody to enter a building and travel to any floor without question. After the attack, security stations were installed in lobbies, employees were required to carry identification badges that granted them access to their suites, and procedures for vendors and visitors established. A number of organizations were formed in the wake of the shootings, including Legal Community Against Violence,Visit Our New Site!. Lcav.org. which acts as a resource for information on federal, state, and local firearms policies. The AJC founded the Jack Berman Advocacy CenterNational Special Interest Groups - Project Vote Smart . Vote-smart.org. to lobby and organize with regard to gun control and violence reduction. The law firm of Pettit & Martin did not survive for long after the attack. They were already on the decline, and the attack was a brutal blow to the struggling firm. After the defections of several partners, the firm dissolved in 1995. SFGate.com.

Initially, they hired bass player Tim Milhouse, and drummer Mikey Rivera, both friends of their then manager Bill Fold. Tim Milhouse ceased his playing with the Kinison . They then recruited bassist Frank Figueroa, from a band called 401 Waterman. Frank played bass on the band's debut EP, Mortgage is Bank. Soon after their recording, Frank quit The Kinison to find work as a registered nurse. The trio soon recruited Mike V and Mikey to complete the band. After 9 months of playing tiny shows in the Inland Empire and Los Angeles area. they landed a spot on the indie rock festival This Ain't No Picnic. The band recorded an EP Mortgage Is Bank in September 2002 for Fearless Records. In the spring of 2003 The Kinison found their way onto Coachella, a two-day music festival in Indio, California. In late 2004 they were one of the support acts for Blink-182 on a number of their European tour dates.

He became king after Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana forced the abdication of Surendra's father, Rajendra Bikram Shah. Surendra wielded little real power, with Jang Bahadur Rana effectively ruling the country during Surendra's reign. Early life Surendra was the son of King Rajendra and his first wife, Queen Samrajya. He was born the crown prince of Nepal and was relatively unpopular. Name Surendra means \\"Chief of Deities\\". Prince regent Surendra's stepmother, Queen Rajya Lakshmi, was ambitious to have her son, Prince Ranendra, sit on the throne. However, Jung Bahadur, who was ambitious and wanted power, might have cooperated with Rajya Lakshmi for his own motive. After the Kot massacre, in which Jung Bahadur managed to eliminate a large number of nobles, Jung Bahadur turned against the queen, who in turn plotted to kill him (though the plot failed). Thinking Queen Rajya Lakshmi might be a threat to him, Jung Bahadur, who had become the prime minister, exiled Rajya Lakshmi to Varanasi. King Rajendra also accompanied her to Varanasi. Before leaving, he made Surendra the prince regent. However, later Jung Bahadur Rana forced the abdication of King Rajendra, and then Surendra was made the king.Himalaya Life as the king Picture of King Surendra Bikram Shah with two body guards taken by the then British Assistant Resident Clarence Comyn Taylor around 1862-1865. King Surendra was like a prisoner in his own palace: with the exception of his immediate family, nobody could visit him without the permission of Jung Bahadur Rana. The king was only allowed to read literature. Frustrated at all these, the king wanted to abdicate in favor of his eldest son Trailokya, but the Rana prime minister did not allow it. Surendra was allowed to meet his father, the ex-king Rajendra, once every month. Rajendra continued to live under house arrest until his death. In 1856, King Surendra issued a sanad- which formalized the dominance and political leadership of the Kunwar family- the family of Jung Bahadur Rana. The king and his descendants could use the honorific title of 'Shri' five times with their names, while the members of the Kunwar family used the title thrice- placing the Kunwar family in a rank that was second only to the royal family. While Surendra remained the king (Maharajadhiraja), he had little power; Jung Bahadur Rana ruled the country.Google Books Surendra's son, General and Crown Prince Trailokya Bir Bikram Shah Deva married three of Jung Bahadur Rana's daughters, Tara Rajya Lakhsmi Devi, Lalit Rajeshwori Rajya Lakshmi Devi and Hiranyagarbha Kumari Devi. Trilokya died in 1878, and Trilokya's son Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah became heir to the throne. Death Surendra died in 1881. His grandson Prithvi succeeded him as the king of Nepal.

He is viewed as one of the most talented Soviet armor commanders.David Glantz, Jonathan House, The Battle of Kursk, University Press of Kansas, 1999 P62 His most notable command during the German-Soviet War was that of 1st Guards Tank Army which he commanded during the Battle of Kursk, Proskurov- Chernovtsy Operation, Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, the Vistula Oder Operation, and the Battle of Berlin. He also commanded 1st Guards Tank Brigade during the Battle of Moscow, and 3rd Mechanised CorpsDavid Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat ‚Äì The Red Army's Epic Disaster in Operation Mars 1942, University Press of Kansas, 1998 P140 during Operation Mars.  Early life  Katukov was born on 17 September 1900 in the village of Bolshoe Uvarovo in Kolomensky Uyezd, Moscow Governorate, now in the Ozyory Urban Okrug of Moscow Oblast, to an impoverished peasant family of five children. From a young age he worked on the local landowner's dairy farm. Katukov graduated from the primary rural school. In 1912 he was sent to relatives in Saint Petersburg, where he worked as a messenger boy in a dairy shop, and later in the factories of the city. Katukov participated in the October Revolution in 1917, after which he returned to Bolshoe Uvaravo to take care of his family after his mother's death. Military career Katukov enlisted to the Red Army as a private in 1919. He served during the Russian Civil War, and later served as a tank formation commander before the war. In 1935 he graduated from the Stalin Military Academy and in July 1936 he was promoted to captain. In October 1938 came his first major command as acting commanding officer of the 5th Light Tank Brigade of the 45th Mechanized Corps. He survived the purges. =Second World War= On the onset of the war he took command of the 4th Tank Brigade. In the battle of Moscow in 1941, it was Katukov's Tank Brigade, then part of the 1st Guards Rifle Corps, that checked the advance of Guderian's Panzergruppe 2 near Tula. To honor this achievement it became the 1st Guards Tank Brigade. Later during Operation Mars in December 1942, Katukov's command managed a deep penetration into the German lines in Rhzev. In January 1943 he took command of the 1st Guards Tank Army, a post he held for the duration of the war. In the battle of Kursk, Katukov's command was one of the two armies that were hardest-hit by the initial German advance on the southern shoulder. Through the use of well-defended and sited strong-points, dug in tanks, and judicious use of counterattacks, Katukov managed to extract a high toll from the German attackers breaking through the defensive system. He commanded his tank army in the Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation, Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive, the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin. Mikhail Katukov was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union twice (29 September 1944 and 6 April 1945). =Post-War= Following the war he became commander of the mechanized forces of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, and later Inspector General of the Army. In popular culture In the 1970 film Patton, Katukov is portrayed drinking a toast with General Patton to celebrate their armies' mutual victory over Nazi Germany.

It is the only species in the genus Brosme. Other common names include Tusk, Torsk, European Cusk, Brosmius.Cusk Fish and seafood fact sheets. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Description It is easily distinguished at a glance from other cod-like fish as it has only one dorsal fin. Also characteristic is the nature of the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins, they are continuous at the base but separated by very deep notches so that they are obviously distinct. Moreover, the caudal fin is evenly rounded. It is variable in color, from slate to reddish brown above, and paling to gray on the lower sides and underneath. Older fish are usually plain colored, while the young often have transverse yellow bands on the sides. The maximum length is about 4 ft (120 cm) and top weight about 45 lb (20 kg). The IGFA world record stands at 37 lb 14 oz (17,20 kg), caught by Anders Jonasson outside S√∏r√∏ya in northern Norway. Distribution and habitat It is distributed on both sides of the North Atlantic, mostly in moderately deep water. On the North American coast, it is regularly found southward to Cape Cod and occasionally off New Jersey. Its maximum range covers most of the North Atlantic, including the waters around Iceland and the Norwegian coast. It is also found on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Cusk show little genetic differentiation over large distances, except where populations are surrounded by deep-water areas, namely on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Rockall Bank. This suggests deep-water areas are barriers for adult movements, and, though they have pelagic eggs and larvae, dispersal during early life stages is not effective over long distances, either. It is normally found in water deeper than 600 ft (200 to 500 m), and practically always is taken over rough bottoms where rocks, ledges, or gravel are common. Good fishing areas are usually much more limited than is the case with cod, haddock, or pollock. It is an offshore fish and rarely is one taken in a harbor. It should not be confused with the Burbot, which is also called the \\"freshwater cusk\\", of a different Lotidae genus.  Pollution  Like many other marine animals, the Cusk is directly affected by pollution. A specific pollutant that affects the Cusk fish is inorganic mercury (Hg). Within aquatic ecosystems, mercury can get converted to methylmercury (MeHg), which is one of the most toxic species of mercury compounds. MeHGg is subject to biomagnification and bioaccumulation within marine food webs. Cusk are a food source for many other organisms. Therefore, the toxins they accumulate over time directly affect any other organism that consumes them, including humans. Studies that were conducted in Western Norway, Central Europe, and the Mediterranean have shown that mercury concentrations within fish are highest in wild-marine fish, which sometimes exceed food safety guidelines of 500 ug/kg, whereas wild-freshwater and farmed fish have less mercury within their system. This is probably due to the fact that most mercury first enters rivers from inland sources and then accumulates in marine environments where the cusk live. In addition to this, it has also been shown that mercury concentrations are higher within fjords rather than coastal and open areas. This is likely due to the morphology of the fjords, or by local anthropogenic activities. Mercury trophic transfer within an aquatic environment. Habits It spawns in the spring and summer, usually between April and early July. A medium-sized female has been known to produce more than two million buoyant eggs. The young live near the surface until they are about 2 in (5 cm) long, and then seek out rocky ocean floors in deep water. Food It is strictly a bottom-dwelling species, and is sluggish and a rather weak swimmer. It eats crustaceans and other soft-bodied invertebrates and mollusks. Fishing technique thumb Cusk are primarily fished on the North American North Atlantic coastal shelf near the American state of Maine and the Canadian Maritimes. In the Gulf of Maine, cusk are chiefly taken on hook and line. Line trawls account for most of the commercial catch off the New England coast, and most of them are caught during the winter and spring. The commercial catch individuals run between 1 and 2 feet long (30‚Äì60 cm), and average about 5 pounds (2 kg). It is an excellent food fish. It is marketed as fresh or frozen fillets; a part of the catch is smoked. Global annual cusk catches in 1950-2003 from FAO statistics. The highest catch was 55,000 tonnes in 1980. Conservation status Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) considers this species endangered based on a 2012 Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada assessment. COSEWIC Species Database: Cusk. COSEWIC The status report identified that catches of cusk in the DFO summer bottom trawl survey had declined by roughly 90% from 1970 to the late 1990s.SARA registry report on Cusk (PDF) - Fisheries and Oceans Canada report on the state of cusk fisheries A landings limit of 1000 mt was put in place in 1999 in the 4X North American Fisheries Organization area and was further restricted to 750 t and expanded to include the 4VWX5Z NAFO areas in 2003. Cusk are still commonly caught as bycatch in the longline and lobster fisheries and can be found in supermarkets in Atlantic Canada despite its threatened status. Cusk is a US National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern are those species about which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the Endangered Species Act(ESA). On March 9, 2007 the National Marine Fisheries Service announced the initiation of a status review to determine whether the species warrants listing under the ESA.NMFS.

It is applied in industry and in organic synthesis, in part because of the inconvenience and expense of using gaseous H2. One large scale application of transfer hydrogenation is coal liquefaction using \\"donor solvents\\" such as tetralin.Speight, J. G. \\"The Chemistry and Technology of Coal\\" Marcel Dekker; New York, 1983; p. 226 ff. . Organometallic catalysts In the area of organic synthesis, a useful family of hydrogen-transfer catalysts have been developed based on ruthenium and rhodium complexes, often with diamine and phosphine ligands.T. Ikariya, K. Murata, R. Noyori \\"Bifunctional Transition Metal-Based Molecular Catalysts for Asymmetric Syntheses\\" Org. Biomol. Chem., 2006, volume 4, 393-406. A representative catalyst precursor is derived from (cymene)ruthenium dichloride dimer and the tosylated diphenylethylenediamine. These catalysts are mainly employed for the reduction of ketones and imines to alcohols and amines, respectively. The hydrogen-donor (transfer agent) is typically isopropanol, which converts to acetone upon donation of hydrogen. Transfer hydrogenations can proceed with high enantioselectivities when the starting material is prochiral: :RR'C=O + Me2CHOH ‚Üí RR'C*H-OH + Me2C=O where RR'C*H-OH is a chiral product. A typical catalyst is (cymene)R,R-HNCHPhCHPhNTs, where Ts = SO2C6H4Me and R,R refers to the absolute configuration of the two chiral carbon centers. This work was recognized with the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Ry≈çji Noyori.Shimizu, H., Nagasaki, I., Matsumura, K., Sayo, N., and Saito, T. \\"Developments in Asymmetric Hydrogenation from an Industrial Perspective\\" Acc. Chem. Res. 2007, vol. 40, pp. 1385-1393. Another family of hydrogen-transfer agents are those based on aluminium alkoxides, such as aluminium isopropoxide in the MPV reduction; however their activities are relatively low by comparison with the transition metal-based systems. Transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by transition metal complexes proceeds by an \\"outer sphere mechanism.\\" Metal-free routes Prior to the development of catalytic hydrogenation, many methods were developed for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates. Many of these methods are only of historical and pedagogical interest. One prominent transfer hydrogenation agent is diimide or (NH)2, also called diazene. This becomes oxidized to the very stable N2: Transfer hydrogenation The diimide is generated from hydrazine. Two hydrocarbons that can serve as hydrogen donors are cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene. In this case, an alkane is formed, along with a benzene. The gain of aromatic stabilization energy when the benzene is formed is the driving force of the reaction. Pd can be used as a catalyst and a temperature of 100 ¬∞C is employed. More exotic transfer hydrogenations have been reported, including this intramolecular one: Transfer hydrogenation Many reactions exist with alcohol or amines as the proton donors, and alkali metals as electron donors. Of continuing value is the sodium metal-mediated Birch reduction of arenes (another name for aromatic hydrocarbons). Less important presently is the Bouveault‚ÄìBlanc reduction of esters. The combination of magnesium and methanol is used in alkene reductions, e.g. the synthesis of asenapine: Magnesium methanol reduction in asenapine synthesis Organocatalytic transfer hydrogenation Organocatalytic transfer hydrogenation has been described by the group of List in 2004 in a system with a Hantzsch ester as hydride donor and an amine catalyst: Organocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation Yang 2004 In this particular reaction the substrate is an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The proton donor is oxidized to the pyridine form and resembles the biochemically relevant coenzyme NADH. In the catalytic cycle for this reaction the amine and the aldehyde first form an iminium ion, then proton transfer is followed by hydrolysis of the iminium bond regenerating the catalyst. By adopting a chiral imidazolidinone MacMillan organocatalyst an enantioselectivity of 81% ee was obtained: :Asymmetric Organocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation Yang 2004 :MacMillan Asymmetric Organocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation In a case of stereoconvergence, both the E-isomer and the Z-isomer in this reaction yield the (S)-enantiomer. Extending the scope of this reaction towards ketones or rather enones requires fine tuning of the catalyst (add a benzyl group and replace the t-butyl group by a furan) and of the Hantzsch ester (add more bulky t-butyl groups): :Organocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation Enones Tuttle 2006 With another organocatalyst altogether, hydrogenation can also be accomplished for imines. One cascade reaction is catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid: :Transfer hydrogenation Imine Reduction Rueping 2006 The reaction proceeds via a chiral iminium ion. Traditional metal-based catalysts, hydrogenation of aromatic or heteroaromatic substrates tend to fail.

The screenplay by Steve Martin is loosely based on the 1861 novel Silas Marner by George Eliot. Martin stars, along with Gabriel Byrne, Laura Linney, Catherine O'Hara and Stephen Baldwin. Plot When high school music teacher Michael McCann discovers his wife is pregnant by his best friend, he divorces her and retreats into a life of solitude as a maker of finely crafted furniture in rural Virginia. Five years later, his only companion is a valuable collection of gold coins. Tanny Newland, the unsavory younger brother of politician John Newland, crashes his brother's car in the woods surrounding Michael's house, seriously injuring the woman he is with. Afraid of being arrested for drunk driving, Tanny steals Michael's coins while he is sleeping, takes off into the night and is never seen again. Weeks later during a winter storm, Michael is startled to discover a toddler has wandered into his home while he was outside gathering wood. A short distance away he discovers the body of her mother, a heroin addict whose car had run out of gas nearby. Unbeknownst to him, the child is the maritally illegitimate daughter of John Newland, who participates in the investigation but keeps his relationship to the child a secret in order to protect his career. Michael is permitted to adopt the child and christens her Mathilda. She proves to be a bit of a handful in her early years, but with the help of friend and local shopkeeper April Simon, Michael manages to raise her to be a bright, personable, precocious young lady, and the once sour, lonely man is transformed by her presence. As John Newland watches his daughter grow older, he begins to invite her to join him and wife Nancy in their home. John arranges for her to learn to ride a horse, eventually giving her one of her own. Due to Nancy's two miscarriages and the couple's deep desire to have a child, Nancy insists on adoption. John finally reveals Mathilda's true identity and his desire to adopt her properly. Nancy encourages him to gain custody of the girl, and a trial ensues. Although the lawyer tries to manipulate the court and Mathilda herself to see that the Newlands are the better parents, Mathilda herself still refuses and honestly prefers Michael. The judge is inclined to side with the Newlands, given their wealth and ability to provide Mathilda with advantages she never would have with Michael. Then the remains of Tanny Newland - surrounded by the gold coins he stole from Michael - are found at the bottom of the quarry his brother was draining to create a lake surrounded by real estate he planned to sell. Michael's sudden return to wealth - and the judge's realization that Tanny was most likely killed by his brother - convinces him that Mathilda should remain with Michael. The film ends with Michael taking Mathilda to visit her late mother's grave, in a remote potter's cemetery.

He observed, \\"Try as I might, I just couldn't accept this Victorian story in modern dress. The motivations seemed wrong (would 20th century people behave this way?), the plotting seemed contrived (as indeed it was), and the plot's habit of springing big surprises on us was too manipulative. This is not at all a bad movie, mind you, but a good movie gone wrong, through a simple twist of miscalculation.\\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post said, \\"When clowns write sad stories for themselves, the results are almost always disastrous. For A Simple Twist of Fate, Steve Martin not only wrote the screenplay ... but also executive-produced the project, creating for himself a character that is about as different from his typical roles as can be imagined. And if the exercise isn't precisely disastrous, it comes very close to it ... Perhaps it's a stretch for a performer with such remarkable charisma to play someone who is without it ... Martin does a skillful job of nullifying himself, and he does present a side of himself that has been glimpsed only briefly. But what a joyless accomplishment it is. As a comic, Martin soars, but here he has clipped his own wings.\\" According to Variety, \\"The pairing of Steve Martin and 19th-century novelist George Eliot seems about as likely an artistic union as Oliver Stone adapting Louisa May Alcott. Yet A Simple Twist of Fate - inspired by Silas Marner - betrays no tell-tale strains of clashing sensibilities. Martin leavens the material somewhat, but this is a faithful, heartfelt, somber piece about family and responsibility.\\" But Kevin Thomas, in the Los Angeles Times, gives Steve Martin and director Gillies MacKinnon credit for taking risks by updating the classic George Eliot novel. He describes it as a \\"charming update of Silas Marner\\" that is well written, well played and has substance and a musical score that successfully bring 19th century literature into a moving and powerful modern-day film. The film currently holds a 43% rating on RottenTomatoes.com. Box office The film opened on 319 screens on Labor Day weekend and earned $1,404,904 over a four-day period, ranking #19 among all releases. It eventually grossed $3,430,583 at the domestic box office.

While a live-action series, animations are used throughout as thoughts and imaginations. The segments are comical, bizarre and sometimes dark. Though the show enjoyed much bigger success in Canada, the show was originally made for the American market under the distribution of 20th Television and aired on many Fox affiliated stations during the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 seasons.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJwbeBwvqkc The show aired in Canada on Global and YTV. It has been called \\"an imitation of Saved by the Bell\\" by critics, and featured an ensemble cast of high school students at Thomas A. Edison High School. As of 2018, the show is airing in Canada on ABC Spark. Characters Cody Anthony Miller (Jamie Elman), the protagonist of the show, was the cartoonist for the high school newspaper publication of the same name as the show, which rivaled the official school paper led by Victor Kane (Miklos Perlus). In the first season, Cody had an ongoing rivalry with Victor, the weaselly editor of the Student Voice, but they became friends after the staff of the \\"Student Voice\\" joined \\"Student Bodies\\". The audience regularly saw his thoughts on the show's current situation in the form of his cartoons, a technique that has been used on other shows such as Lizzie McGuire. His cartoons were also often used as scene and location transitions, as a continuation of the current live scene, and in the opening and closing sequences. Another main source of Cody's cartoon drawings were his relationships with his girlfriends throughout the series, who included \\"Student Bodies\\" editor Emily Roberts (Nicole Lyn) and fellow member Grace Vasquez (Victoria Sanchez), and other characters including \\"transition\\" girlfriend Holly Benson (Katheryn Winnick) and Kim McCloud (Jennifer Finnigan), who became a main character in the third season. Others in the cast included Erin Simms, who played Morgan McKnight in the first season and was the object of Chris Sheppard's (Ross Hull) infatuation, before he and Margaret \\"Mags\\" Abernathy (Katie Emme McIninch) became a couple on the show. Jessica Goldapple played Francesca \\"Flash\\" Albright, the photographer loyal to Victor Kane (Miklos Perlus) and Mark Taylor played Romeo Carter, who became Emily's boyfriend after Cody and Emily broke up. Romeo and Emily break up near the end of the show's final season. Staff at Edison High included vice-principal Mrs. Morton, played by Michelle Sweeney. Trivia *The show was produced in Montreal and was broadcast in English; there was a French translation (in Quebec) called Vice-Versa, and appeared on Canal Famille. *The show's opening theme song (as well as the opening credits sequence) changed after the first season's, to a pop rock-style theme song. This new theme song remained until the end of the series. *The show was shot in an abandoned high school in Montreal, which was used as a studio. *Co-creator Alan Silberberg designed the animated segments.
