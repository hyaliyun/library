It was discovered in 2004, and in 2012 was imaged more closely by the Cassini orbiter probe. History Discovery image of Methone on 1 June 2004 Methone was first seen by the Cassini Imaging Team and given the temporary designation '. Methone is also named ' (32). The Cassini spacecraft made two visits to Methone and its closest approach was made on May 20, 2012 with a minimum distance of from it. The name Methone was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21, 2005. It was ratified at the IAU General Assembly in 2006. Methone (Greek ŒúŒµŒ∏œéŒΩŒ∑) was one of the Alkyonides, the seven beautiful daughters of the Giant Alkyoneus. Orbit Methone's orbit is visibly affected by a perturbing 14:15 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about in semi-major axis, and 5¬∞ in longitude of its periapsis on a timescale of about 450 days. Its eccentricity also varies on different timescales between 0.0011 and 0.0037, and its inclination between about 0.003¬∞ and 0.020¬∞. Physical characteristics In May 2012, the Cassini spacecraft obtained its first close-up photographs of Methone, revealing an egg-shaped moonlet with a remarkably smooth surface, with no visible craters. The moons Pallene and Aegaeon are thought to be similarly smooth. Methone has two different sharply defined albedo regions, one distinctly (~13%) darker centered on Methone's leading point. Its brighter area has an albedo of ~0.70. UV and IR spectra gave no indication of a color difference between the two regions, suggesting that a physical rather than compositional difference may be responsible. Increased exposure to electrons from Saturn's magnetosphere has been proposed to be responsible for thermal anomalies on the leading hemispheres of Mimas and Tethys, and a similar irradiation anisotropy might be behind Methone's albedo pattern. Methone's mean radius is . Assuming that Methone is in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. that its elongated shape simply reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and Methone's gravity, its density can be estimated: , among the lowest density values obtained or inferred for a Solar System body. This indicates that Methone is composed of icy fluff, material that might be mobile enough to explain the lack of craters. Relationship with Saturn's rings Material blasted off Methone by micrometeoroid impacts is believed to the source of the Methone Ring Arc, a faint partial ring around Saturn co-orbital with Methone that was discovered in September 2006.

It is one of three small moons known as the Alkyonides that lie between the orbits of the larger Mimas and Enceladus. It is also designated '.  Discovery  Discovery image of Pallene in 2004 from the Cassini probe Pallene was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in 2004, during the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission. It was given the temporary designation '. In 2005, the name Pallene was provisionally approved by the IAU Division III Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, and was ratified at the IAU General Assembly in 2006. The name refers to Pallene, one of the Alkyonides, the seven beautiful daughters of the giant Alkyoneus. After the discovery in 2004, it was realized that Pallene had been first photographed on August 23, 1981, by the space probe '. It had appeared in a single photograph and had been provisionally named ' and estimated to orbit 200,000 km from Saturn. Because it had not been visible in other images, it had not been possible to compute its orbit at the time, but recent comparisons have shown it to match Pallene's orbit.  Orbital characteristics  Pallene is visibly affected by a perturbing mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Enceladus, although this effect is not as large as Mimas's perturbations on Methone. The perturbations cause Pallene's osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 4 km in semi-major axis, and 0.02¬∞ in longitude (corresponding to about 75 km). Eccentricity also changes on various timescales between 0.002 and 0.006, and inclination between about 0.178¬∞ and 0.184¬∞.  Ring  In 2006, images taken in forward-scattered light by the Cassini spacecraft enabled the Cassini Imaging Team to discover a faint dust ring around Saturn that shares Pallene's orbit, now named the Pallene Ring. The ring has a radial extent of about 2,500 km. Its source is particles blasted off Pallene's surface by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around its orbital path.  Exploration  The Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons until September, 2017, performed a fly-by of Pallene on 16 October 2010, and 14 September 2011 at a distance of 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) and 44,000 kilometers respectively.

Early life in New York Begole was born in Groveland, New York. His ancestors were French Huguenots who emigrated to the United States in the last quarter of the 18th century to escape religious persecution and settled in Hagerstown, Maryland. Josiah's father, William (1786‚Äì1862) was born there and moved to Livingston County, New York in 1802. William served in the War of 1812 and married the daughter of an American Revolutionary War veteran. Three of Williams sons, including Josiah, the eldest, eventually moved to Genesee County, Michigan. He attended the public schools in Mount Morris and Temple Hill Academy in Geneseo, New York. Life and Politics in Michigan Begole moved to Flint, Michigan in August 1836 and taught school in 1837 and 1838. In the spring of 1839, he married Harriet A. Miles. He engaged in agricultural pursuits from 1839 to 1856 and was school inspector, justice of the peace and township treasurer. Being an anti-slavery man, he became a member of the Republican party at its organization. He was county treasurer 1856‚Äì1864. He was briefly engaged in the lumber business in 1863. His eldest son was killed during the American Civil War near Atlanta, Georgia in 1864, and was the greatest sorrow of his life. He was a member of the Michigan Senate in 1870 and 1871, and a member of the Flint City Council for three years. During that time, he served on the Committees of Finance and Railroads, and was Chairman of the Committee on the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and Blind. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Philadelphia in 1872 to re- nominate U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and to nominate Henry Wilson as the new Vice President. Congress Begole was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 6th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives for the 43rd Congress, serving from March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1875. During that time, he was a member of the Committee on Agricultural and Public Expenditures. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1874 and resumed the lumber business, Begole Fox & Co. He later engaged in the manufacture of wagons founding Flint Wagon Works and also engaged in banking. Governor In 1882, Begole was gubernatorial candidate of the Greenback and Democratic parties, defeating the Republican incumbent David Jerome by over 7,000 votes. He served one term from 1883 to 1885. As a former Republican who ousted a Republican incumbent, Begole faced many obstacles with a Republican- dominated legislature. As a result, the establishment of the state bureau of labor statistics was one of the few acts that was approved. He ran for re- election in 1884, but was defeated by Republican Russell Alger, after which he resumed his former business activities. He was an early activist for women's suffrage, and in 1884 Begole became vice president of the first statewide suffrage organization, the Michigan Equal Suffrage Association. Retirement and death Begole died at the age of eighty-one in Flint and is interred in Glenwood Cemetery there.

Through his 16 years in professional baseball, Bonilla accumulated a .279 batting average, with a .358 on-base percentage and a .472 slugging percentage. He was on the Florida Marlins team that won the 1997 World Series. Bonilla led the league in extra base hits (78) during the 1990 MLB season and doubles (44) during the 1991 MLB season. He also participated in six MLB All-Star Games and won three Silver Slugger Awards. From 1992 to 1994, Bonilla was the highest-paid player in the league, earning more than $6 million per year. Since 2011, Bonilla has been paid approximately $1.19 million by the New York Mets each year. The 25 payments come every July 1, which some fans refer to as \\"Bobby Bonilla Day\\". This was part of a deal made when the Mets released Bonilla before the 2000 season while still owing him $5.9 million for the final year of his contract. The deal expires in 2035, at which point Bonilla will have been paid $29.8 million for a season in which he did not even play for the Mets. Playing career Bonilla played baseball at Herbert H. Lehman High School in the Bronx and graduated in 1981. He was not selected in the 1981 Major League Baseball draft and spent a semester at New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, New York pursuing a degree in computer science. He was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates after being spotted by scout Syd Thrift at a baseball camp in Europe. His rise through the Pirates' farm system came to a halt during spring training in 1985 when he broke his right leg in a collision with teammate Bip Roberts. The Chicago White Sox then acquired him through the Rule 5 draft during the 1985‚Äì86 offseason, and Bonilla made his major league debut with the White Sox at the start of the 1986 season. Thrift, then the Pirates' general manager, reacquired the unhappy Bonilla in exchange for pitcher Jos√© DeLe√≥n later that year. Bonilla also played from 1984 to 1988 with the Mayag√ºez Indians of the Puerto Rican Winter League. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Bonilla became the Pirates' starting third baseman in 1987, but after committing 67 errors over his next two seasons, manager Jim Leyland moved him to right field. There he formed a formidable combination alongside stars Barry Bonds and Andy Van Slyke and helped propel the Pittsburgh Pirates to two of their three straight National League Eastern Division titles from 1990 to 1992. From 1986 to 1991, Bonilla had a .284 batting average, with 868 hits, 191 doubles, 114 home runs, and 500 runs batted in (RBIs). He led the league in extra base hits in 1990, and in doubles in 1991. Bonilla also won three Silver Slugger Awards and made the All-Star team four years in a row. On October 28, 1991, he became a free agent. =New York Mets= Bonilla became the highest-paid player in the National League at the time when he signed a 5-year, $29 million contract (equivalent to $ today) with the New York Mets on December 2, 1991. The $6.1 million he received in 1992 was a record for a single season by a margin of $2.3 million. However, his offensive production diminished somewhat, finishing with a .278 batting average, 91 home runs, and 277 runs batted in during his three-and-a-half-year tenure with the Mets. Despite this, Bonilla ended up participating in two more All-Star Games (1993 and 1995). Bonilla's time with the Mets was marked by a contentious relationship with New York baseball media. In his introductory press conference after signing with the organization, he challenged them by stating, ‚ÄúI know you all are gonna try, but you‚Äôre not gonna be able to wipe the smile off my face.‚Äù\\"Athletes & the Media: There is No Joy in Covering Mudville,\\" GQ (magazine), October 1993. On another occasion, he called the press box during a game to complain about an error that he was charged with. =Baltimore Orioles= Bonilla was acquired along with a player to be named later (Jimmy Williams on August 16) by the Baltimore Orioles from the Mets in exchange for Damon Buford and Alex Ochoa on July 28, 1995, and helped the Orioles to the American League Championship Series in 1996.Olney, Buster. \\"All-Star slugger acquired from Mets for minor- leaguers Ochoa and Buford; Orioles get their cleanup man: Bonilla,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Saturday, July 29, 1995. =Florida Marlins= Following the 1996 season, Bonilla was once again granted free agency, and signed with the Florida Marlins, reuniting with his old manager, Jim Leyland, where he helped the Marlins win the 1997 World Series. He returned to the Marlins for the 1998 season and batted .278 through 18 games. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On May 14, 1998, Bonilla was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, along with Manuel Barrios, Jim Eisenreich, Charles Johnson, and Gary Sheffield, in exchange for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. Bonilla spent the rest of the 1998 season with the Dodgers, batting .237, with seven home runs and 30 runs batted in. =Back to the Mets= In November 1998, the New York Mets reacquired Bonilla from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mel Rojas. Again, his level of play did not measure up to expectations and he had numerous clashes with manager Bobby Valentine over lack of playing time. His tenure in New York culminated in an incident during the sixth game of the 1999 NLCS during which the Mets were eliminated by the Braves in 11 innings while Bonilla reportedly sat in the clubhouse playing cards with teammate Rickey Henderson. After his subpar 1999 season, the Mets released Bonilla, but still owed him $5.9 million. Bonilla and his agent offered the Mets a deal: Bonilla would defer payment for a decade, and the Mets would pay him an annual paycheck of $1.19 million starting in 2011 and ending in 2035, adding up to a total payout of $29.8 million. Mets owner Fred Wilpon accepted the deal mostly because he was heavily invested with Ponzi scheme operator Bernie Madoff, and the 10 percent returns he thought he was getting on his investments with Madoff outweighed the eight percent interest the Mets would be paying on Bonilla's initial $5.9 million. As a result, the payout was a subject of inquiry during the Madoff investment scandal investigation when it came to light in 2008. =Atlanta Braves= Bonilla signed with the Braves in 2000 and played a mostly uneventful 114 games for them. He achieved his highest batting average (.255) since the 1997 season, although he hit only five home runs, a far cry from his career high of 34. =St. Louis Cardinals= In 2001, he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals, but injuries reduced his playing time. He played his final game on October 7, 2001, and finished the season with a .213 average, 37 hits, five home runs, and 21 runs batted in. He retired after the season finished citing \\"injuries and reduced playing time\\" as the main reason for his decision. Overall, Bonilla finished his career with one championship, six All- Star appearances, 2,010 hits, 287 home runs, 1,173 runs batted in, and a career .279 batting average. Personal life Bonilla met Migdalia \\"Millie\\" Bonilla at Herbert Lehman High School in The Bronx. They married in the late 1980s and had two children together. He and his wife divorced in 2009. =Charity= In February 1992, Bonilla and his wife Millie started the Bobby and Millie Bonilla Public School Fund with $35,000. The fund benefits schools attended by Bonilla and his wife, by contributing $500 for every run he batted in for the Mets. Bonilla also participated in other charity events, like the Players Trust All-Star Golf Tournament, organized by Dave Winfield and Joe Mauer in 2014.

The film follows a group of record store employees over the course of one exceptional day. The employees try to stop the store from being sold to a large chain, and learn about each other along the way. The film generated largely negative reviews and major losses at the domestic US box office at its release, but later went on to become a cult hit, helping to launch the careers of several of its stars.Empire Records. boxofficemojo.com.

Plot At an independent record store in Delaware named Empire Records, employee Lucas has been tasked by store manager Joe with closing the store for the first time. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas discovers that Empire Records is about to be sold and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national chain. Determined to keep the store independent, Lucas hatches a plan and takes the day's cash receipts of approximately $9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City and quadruple it playing Craps. Though he successfully doubles the money on his first roll, he loses everything on the second. Lucas is found the following morning by fellow Empire employees A.J. and Mark. He confides in the pair about the previous night's events, just before riding off on his motorcycle. Joe arrives and quickly receives frantic phone calls about the missing deposit from both the bank and the store's owner, Mitchell Beck. Other employees arrive for work, including overachieving high school student Corey and her uninhibited best friend Gina. Hostile employee Deb, who has survived an apparent suicide attempt, also arrives. When Lucas arrives, Joe confronts him about the missing deposit, and Lucas confirms the money was lost. Joe explains his anti-Music Town plan to the employees - he had saved enough money to invest and become part-owner of the store to save it, but will now be $9,000 short when he covers for the missing money with Mitchell. Joe is distracted from dealing with the crisis due to a major store event: Rex Manning Day. Manning is a washed-up 1980s pop idol who will be performing an autograph session at the store for fans. The staff is unenthused and reacts by mocking both Manning and the event, and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men. Shoplifter \\"Warren\\" is taken away by police but vows to return seeking revenge. Though detained by Joe in his office, Lucas nonetheless apprehends a belligerent young shoplifter who identifies himself only as \\"Warren Beatty\\". Encouraged by Gina, Corey indulges her schoolgirl crush on Manning by attempting to seduce him, but winds up humiliated and dejected; A.J. then chooses this inopportune time to confess his love to Corey, which she rejects. After Gina and Corey argue about their respective bad reputations, Gina has sex with Manning. When this is discovered by the staff, A.J. attacks Manning, Gina reveals Corey's addiction to amphetamines, Corey hysterically trashes the store, and Joe asks Manning to leave the store. Deb reacts uncharacteristically to Corey's dilemma by attempting to cheer her up, and in return Corey holds a mock funeral for Deb which the whole staff attends. The belligerent young shoplifter \\"Warren\\" returns to the store with a gun (ultimately loaded with blanks), and Lucas defuses the situation by revealing that he himself was a troubled youth until he was taken in and saved by Joe. Joe in turn offers \\"Warren\\" a job at the store. After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests confessing the truth about the missing money to store owner Mitchell. However, the staff try to replace the missing money but can only raise $3000. Suddenly inspired, Mark runs in front of the store to a news crew covering the holdup, and announces on live TV a late-night benefit party at the store to \\"Save the Empire\\". The store opens its doors and collects donations during an impromptu concert on the roof by Gina and another employee named Berko. Joe hands the money raised to Mitchell, who confesses that he hates the store and offers to sell it to Joe. Corey finally finds a dejected A.J. on the roof fixing the Empire Records sign, and confesses that she loves him too. A.J. decides to attend art school in Boston so he can be near her while she attends Harvard. They kiss, and the staff ends the long day with a dance party on the roof. Cast Production Two days after Regency Enterprises executive Michael Nathanson gave approval to proceed with making Empire Records, he was approached with the script for Clueless. As he already had a \\"teen movie\\" in hand, he turned down the eventual $57 million box office hit, and proceeded with production of the eventual box-office bomb of Empire Records. The film was severely edited in post-production, removing three significant characters and up to 40 minutes of film. The story was also condensed from occurring over two days to a single day. Exteriors were filmed at 15 South Front Street in Wilmington, North Carolina, in a bar that had a few feet of space converted into a replica of the store set which was located at Carolco (now Screen Gems) studios, and finished with a large picture of the rest of the store. This allowed the actors to enter the exterior location doors and walk a couple of feet before the scene would cut to the interior set on Soundstage 4 at the studio. The large mural of Gloria Estefan which Mark kisses early in the film was visible for many years on the separate building, on South Water Street, that stood in for the back of the store. The Rex Manning music video \\"Say No More, Mon Amour\\" was shot prior to principal photography, and was shot on Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina in one day. It was only intended to be a 17-second dance move piece for the main actors to make fun of in the film. However, the director of the music video shot for the entire day and gave the producers an entire 4:30 music video. Critical reception The film did poorly at the box office and received negative reviews upon its 1995 release. TV Guide gave the film 2 stars out of 5, calling it a \\"lame comedy\\" that appeared to be little more than \\"an elaborate excuse to package and peddle a soundtrack CD.\\"Empire Records. TV Guide. Retrieved 2016-09-21. Variety called Empire Records a \\"soundtrack in search of a movie\\", describing the film as \\"one teen-music effort that never finds a groove\\" before adding that \\"as far as chart action goes, it could use a bullet -- to put it out of its B.O. misery.\\"Review: ‚ÄòEmpire Records‚Äô. Variety. Retrieved 2016-09-21. Roger Ebert called the film a \\"lost cause,\\" but wrote that some of the actors might have a future in other, better films;(1995-09-22).

LaPaglia, Cochrane, Zellweger, Tyler, Embry and Tunney all went on to varying levels of success in the years following Empire Records. As of March 2019, Empire Records has a 29% \\"Rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews with the consensus: \\"Despite a terrific soundtrack and a strong early performance from Renee Zellweger, Empire Records is mostly a silly and predictable teen dramedy.\\"Empire Records Movie Reviews, Pictures. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2011-02-20. Soundtrack =Background= The soundtrack album for Empire Records was originally attached to Atlantic Records‚Äîan affiliate of Warner Bros. at the time‚Äîbecause Warner Bros. had a distribution pact with the film's producers, Regency Enterprises. However, the soundtrack album was given to A&M; Records in order to obtain the participation of A&M; artists the Gin Blossoms, whose track \\"Til I Hear It from You\\" was issued as the lead single. Besides the Gin Blossoms, four other A&M; acts had new tracks released on the soundtrack album: Ape Hangers, Drill, Innocence Mission, and Lustre. The album also introduced tracks by Better Than Ezra, Cracker, the Cranberries, Evan Dando (whose cover of Big Star's \\"The Ballad of El Goodo\\" featured Empire Records female lead Liv Tyler on background vocals), and Toad The Wet Sprocket, and by unsigned acts the Martinis, Please, and Coyote Shivers. The Martinis‚Äîfeaturing former Pixies members Joey Santiago and Dave Lovering‚Äîwere recommended by Hits magazine president Karen Glauber who was musical consultant for Empire Records, while the film's line music supervisor Bob Knickman discovered Please by searching the internet for unsigned talent suitable for the film's soundtrack. Coyote Shivers, who played aspiring-musician-turned-store-clerk Berko in the film, became involved in the project by virtue of being the stepfather of Liv Tyler (Shivers being married to Tyler's mother, Bebe Buell, at the time). Two previously released tracks were also included on the original release of the Empire Records soundtrack album: \\"A Girl Like You\\" by Edwyn Collins and \\"Ready, Steady, Go\\" by the Meices (the latter's frontman Joe Reineke subsequently led Alien Crime Syndicate). \\"The Honeymoon Is Over\\" by the Cruel Sea, a track heard in the film but not featured on the US release of the soundtrack album, was included on the German and Australian releases. The Gin Blossoms' \\"Til I Hear It From You\\" charted as high as #9, affording the band their first Top 20 hit. Two other tracks from the album had a single release: Edwyn Collins' \\"A Girl Like You,\\" which charted at #32, and the Ape Hangers' \\"I Don't Want to Live Today\\". The Empire Records soundtrack peaked at No. 63 on the album chart.

History  In 1863 a group of fourteen students decided to leave the Imperial Academy of Arts. The students found the rules of the Academy constraining; the teachers were conservative and there was a strict separation between high and low art. In an effort to bring art to the people, the students formed an independent artistic society; The Petersburg Cooperative of Artists (Artel). In 1870, this organization was largely succeeded by the Association of Travelling Art Exhibits (Peredvizhniki) to give people from the provinces a chance to follow the achievements of Russian Art, and to teach people to appreciate art. The society maintained independence from state support and brought the art, which illustrated the contemporary life of the people from Moscow and Saint Petersburg, to the provinces. From 1871 to 1923, the society arranged 48 mobile exhibitions in St. Petersburg and Moscow, after which they were shown in Kyiv, Kharkov, Kazan, Oryol, Riga, Odessa and other cities.  Influence of literary critics  Peredvizhniki were influenced by the public views of the literary critics Vissarion Belinsky and Nikolai Chernyshevsky, both of whom espoused liberal ideas. Belinsky thought that literature and art should attribute a social and moral responsibility. Like most Slavophiles, Chernyshevsky ardently supported the emancipation of serfs, which was finally realized in the reform of 1861. He viewed press censorship, serfdom, and capital punishment as Western influences. Because of his political activism, officials prohibited publication of any of his writing, including his dissertation; but it eventually found its way to the artworld of nineteenth-century Russia. In 1863, almost immediately after the emancipation of serfs, Chernyshevsky‚Äôs goals were realized with the help of Peredvizhniki, who took the pervasive Slavophile-populist idea that Russia had a distinguishable, modest, inner beauty of its own and worked out how to display it on canvas.  Subjects of the paintings  Peredvizhniki portrayed the many-sided aspects of social life, often critical of inequities and injustices. But their art showed not only poverty but also the beauty of the folk way of life; not only suffering but also fortitude and strength of characters. Peredvizhniki condemned the Russian aristocratic orders and autocratic government in their humanistic art. They portrayed the emancipation movement of Russian people with empathy (The Arrest of Propagandist; Refuse from Confession; Not Expected by Ilya Yefimovich Repin). They portrayed social-urban life, and later used historic art to depict the common people (The Morning of the Execution of Streltsy by Vasily Surikov). During their blossoming (1870‚Äì1890), the Peredvizhniki society developed an increasingly wider scope, with more natural and free images. In contrast to the traditional dark palette of the time, they chose a lighter palette, with a freer manner in their technique. They worked for naturalness in their images, and the depiction of people's relationship with their surroundings. The society united most of the highly talented artists of the country. Among Peredvizhniki there were artists of Ukraine, Latvia, and Armenia. The society also showed the work of Mark Antokolski, Vasili Vereshchagin, and Andrei Ryabushkin. The work of the critic and democrat Vladimir Stasov was important for the development of Peredvizhniki's art. Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov showed the work of these artists in his gallery and gave them important material and moral support.  Landscape as the most popular genre of Peredvizhniki  Landscape painting flourished in the 1870s and 1880s. Peredvizhniki painted mainly landscapes; some, like Polenov, used plein air technique. Two painters, Ivan Shishkin and Isaak Levitan, painted only landscapes of Russia. Shishkin is still considered to be the Russian \\"Singer of forest\\", while Levitan's landscapes are famous for their intense moods. The Russian landscape gained importance as a national icon after Peredvizhniki. Peredvizhniki painted landscapes to explore the beauty of their own country and encourage ordinary people to love and preserve it. Levitan once said, \\"I imagine such a gracefulness in our Russian land ‚Äì overflowing rivers bringing everything back to life. There is no country more beautiful than Russia! There can be a true landscapist only in Russia\\". Peredvizhniki gave a national character to landscapes, so people of other nations could recognize Russian landscape. The landscapes of Peredvizhniki are the symbolic embodiments of Russian nationality.  Reproduction of works  Even though the number of travelling exhibition visitors from the provinces was increasing during the years, the main audience was the urban elite. Local photographers created the first reproductions of Peredvizhniki's paintings, which helped popularize the works and could be bought at exhibitions. Niva magazine also published illustrated articles about the exhibitions. Since 1898 the landscapes of the society have been used in the postcard industry. Various books of poems were published with the illustrations of landscapes. Ordinary Russian people at that time could not afford to go to Moscow or Saint Petersburg, so popularization of Russian art made them familiar with a number of Russian art masterpieces. Even now publishers use the reproductions in textbooks as a visual icon of national identity.  Decline of creativity  As the authority and public influence of the society steadily grew, government officials had to stop their efforts to repress the members. Attempts were made to subordinate their activity, and raise the falling value of Academy of Arts- sanctioned works. By the 1890s, the Academy of Arts structure was including Peredvizhniki art in its classes and history, and the influence of the artists showed in national art schools. In 1898, their influence began to be superseded by Mir iskusstva, which advanced modern trends in Russian art. Some of the members of Peredvizhniki became more conservative, but some remained as radical as their predecessors. Some of the artists began showing socialist ideas, which reflected the development of a working-class movement. Many of the Peredvizhniki entered the Soviet art culture bringing the realistic traditions of the 19th century to socialist realism. The 48th exhibition of Peredvizhniki in 1923 was the last one. Most members joined the Association of Artists in Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR). Its members built on the traditions of Peredvizhniki and aspired to create works of art accessible to the common people and faithfully reflecting the righteousness of Soviet society.

Cage explained the punning title thus: \\"For two hundred years the Europeans have been sending us their operas. Now I'm sending them back.\\" Europeras I and II Europeras I and II were premiered by the Frankfurt Opera in December 1987 after a delay caused by fire; both call on the full resources of the house and apply the technique of indeterminacy to plot, stage directions, lighting, costuming, props, and sets, as well as to the music, drawn from fragments of the 18th and 19th century repertoire and intermittently drowned out by a taped Opera Mix, \\"as if you were shouting to someone on the opposite side of the street and a large truck passes by.\\" The libretto, in twenty-four scenarios, likewise juxtaposes traditional operatic episodes: the libretto begins \\"Dressed as an Irish princess, he gives birth; they plot to overthrow the French.\\" The area of the stage is divided into 64 quadrants corresponding to the I Ching and the nineteen singers share the space with dancers. Cage said \\"What I wanted to do was to have the programs such that if twelve people were sitting in a row each one would be looking at a different opera.\\" There is no conductor; performers are instead guided by large projections of a digital clock according to strict time intervals. Cage even went so far as to hand out two separate sets of librettos to the audience at the premiere, themselves culled from previous operatic works. No recordings have yet been released of \\"Europeras I and II.\\" Europeras III and IV Europeras III and IV were commissioned by the Almeida Festival in London and premiered in 1990, subsequently touring.

It peaked at No. 27 on the Billboard 200, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.Billboard Chart History for Joni Mitchell retrieved 2 June 2018.RIAA Gold and Platinum retrieved July 27, 2020. The title makes reference to Laurel Canyon, a centre of popular music culture in Los Angeles during the 1960s. The album includes several of Mitchell's most noted songs, such as \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", \\"Woodstock\\" and \\"The Circle Game\\". Background The album is notable for its expansion of Mitchell's artistic vision and its varied song topics (ranging from the aesthetic weight of celebrity, to observation of the Woodstock generation, to the complexities of love). Ladies of the Canyon is often viewed as a transition between Mitchell's folky earlier work and the more sophisticated, poignant albums that were to follow. In particular, \\"For Free\\" foreshadows the lyrical leitmotif of the isolation triggered by success that would be elaborated upon in For the Roses and Court and Spark. The sparse, alternative- tuning laden sound of later records comes to the forefront on \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\".Weller, Sheila (2008). Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon and the Journey of a Generation, p. 293. Atria. . Of all of Mitchell's work, this album is the most related to her long-standing friendships and relationships with Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young (whose rock arrangement of \\"Woodstock\\" was one of their four radio hits in 1970). A number of the album's songs, including the aforementioned \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\" and \\"Woodstock\\", feature densely stacked, wordless harmony overdubs reminiscent of David Crosby's oeuvre; Crosby himself has performed \\"For Free\\" for many years. \\"Willy\\" is an infatuated paean to Graham Nash, whose middle name is William. \\"The Circle Game\\", one of the artist's early signature songs, features background vocals from all four, and is a response to Neil Young's \\"Sugar Mountain\\". \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" has become a standard over the years, as well as being sampled by Janet Jackson. In 1995 Annie Lennox performed the song \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\" and released it as the B-side of her single \\"No More I Love You's\\". The Young and the Restless star Jess Walton stated that she was the owner of one of the houses featured on the album's cover. Critical reception Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1970, Robert Christgau found Ladies of the Canyon \\"superior to her previous work, richer lyrically and more compelling musically.\\" He said the album's second half is \\"almost perfect, and the arrangements are intelligent throughout\\", but found Mitchell's voice weak and her wordplay inconsistent. Years later in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), he said that, despite the occasional \\"laughably high school\\" wordplay, Mitchell's reliance on piano suggests \\"a move from the open air to the drawing room ... that's reflected in richer, more sophisticated songs.\\" Track listing All tracks are written by Joni Mitchell. ;Side one # \\"Morning Morgantown\\" ‚Äì 3:12 # \\"For Free\\" ‚Äì 4:31 # \\"Conversation\\" ‚Äì 4:21 # \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\" ‚Äì 3:32 # \\"Willy\\" ‚Äì 3:00 # \\"The Arrangement\\" ‚Äì 3:32 ;Side two # \\"Rainy Night House\\" ‚Äì 3:22 # \\"The Priest\\" ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"Blue Boy\\" ‚Äì 2:53 # \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" ‚Äì 2:16 # \\"Woodstock\\" ‚Äì 5:25 # \\"The Circle Game\\" ‚Äì 4:50 Personnel * Joni Mitchell ‚Äì vocals, guitars, keyboards, cover illustration * Teresa Adams ‚Äì cello * Paul Horn ‚Äì clarinet, flute * Jim Horn ‚Äì baritone saxophone * Milt Holland ‚Äì percussion * The Lookout Mountain United Downstairs Choir ‚Äì vocal chorus on \\"The Circle Game\\" Production personnel * Henry Lewy ‚Äì engineer, production advice * Don Bagley ‚Äì cello arrangement References Category:1970 albums Category:Joni Mitchell albums Category:Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles Category:Reprise Records albums Category:Albums produced by Joni Mitchell Category:Albums recorded at A&M; Studios Category:Albums with cover art by Joni Mitchell ","title":"Ladies of the Canyon (album)"},{"id":"905941","text":"The Royal Book of Oz (1921) is the fifteenth in the series of Oz books, and the first to be written after L. Frank Baum's death. Although Baum was credited as the author, it was written entirely by Ruth Plumly Thompson. Beginning in the 1980s, some editions have correctly credited Thompson, although the cover of the 2001 edition by Dover Publications credits only Baum. The original introduction claimed that the book was based on notes by Baum, but this has been disproven. Baum's surviving notes, known as \\"An Oz Book\\" are known from four typewritten pages found at his publisher's, but their authenticity as Baum's work has been disputed. Even if genuine, they bear no resemblance to Thompson's book. Plot summary The Scarecrow is upset when Professor Woggle-bug tells him that he has no family, so he goes back to the corn-field where Dorothy Gale found him to trace his \\"roots.\\" When he fails to return, Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion set out to search for him. They meet an elderly knight, Sir Hokus of Pokes. They also meet the Doubtful Dromedary and the Comfortable Camel. Together, they have several curious adventures while searching for the Scarecrow. In this novel the Scarecrow discovers that, in a previous incarnation, he was human. More specifically, he was the Emperor of the Silver Islands, a kingdom located deep underground beneath the Munchkin region of Oz, inhabited by people who resemble Chinamen. When Dorothy first discovered the Scarecrow (in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) he was hanging from a beanpole in a cornfield; it now develops that this pole descends deep underground to the Silver Islands. The Emperor of the Silver Islands had been transformed into a crocus by an enemy magician; this magical crocus had sprouted and grown into the beanpole all the way up to the surface of the earth. When the farmer placed his scarecrow on the beanpole, the spirit of the transformed Emperor entered the Scarecrow's body, causing him to come to life. The Scarecrow digs at the base of the beanpole and slides down the beanpole to the Silver Islands. The islanders hail him as the Emperor, returned to save his people. After spending some time in his former kingdom ruling the quarrelsome Silver Islanders, the Scarecrow decides to return to Oz and continue his carefree existence there. The islanders, however, are reluctant to let him go, and plot to change him back into his human form, an 85-year-old man. Dorothy and her party reach the Silver Islands, rescue the Scarecrow from the islanders, and accompany him back to the Emerald City. Sir Hokus, the Comfortable Camel, and the Doubtful Dromedary become residents of the Emerald City. Sir Hokus and the Comfortable Camel return as principal characters in The Yellow Knight of Oz.

For some years he ranked as one of the top backstrokers in the world; never a strong below-the-water swimmer, he was unmatched on the surface, but, as the importance of below-the-water swimming increased, Tewksbury's ranking began to fall. Going into Barcelona, Tewksbury was ranked fourth in the world and most pundits picked one of the powerful American swimmers to win gold. American Jeff Rouse, world record holder in the 100m backstroke, had beaten Tewksbury at the 1991 Pan Pacific Games and 1991 World Aquatics Championships the year before and was heavily favored to win gold. Using an underwater dolphin kick start Rouse took off to an early lead, leaving Tewksbury to play catch-up on both laps. Tewksbury would pass Rouse on the last stroke of the race, beating the American by just six one hundredths of a second‚Äîthe same margin of victory Rouse had bested Tewksbury the year before at World Championships. Tewksbury would credit using visualization during his preparation to help instill self-belief and calm in the moments before the Olympic final.

He was also part of the group of former Olympic athletes that was pushing for the resignation of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. Only months after the scandal surrounding the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic winter Games broke, Tewksbury became prominent around the world as a critic of the IOC and demanded reforms to the system.

With headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG operates in more than 70 countries around the globe. By revenue it is the largest coatings company in the world followed by AkzoNobel. It is headquartered in PPG Place, an office and retail complex in downtown Pittsburgh, and is known for its glass facade designed by Philip Johnson. Founding and 20th century Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company plaque in the plaza at PPG Place Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company was founded in 1883 by Captain John Baptiste Ford and John Pitcairn, Jr., at Creighton, Pennsylvania. Based in Creighton, Pennsylvania (about 20 miles north of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River), PPG soon became the United States' first commercially successful producer of high-quality, thick flat glass using the plate process. PPG was also the world's first plate glass plant to power its furnaces with locally produced natural gas, an innovation which rapidly stimulated widespread industrial use of the cleaner-burning fuel. PPG expanded quickly. By 1900, known as the \\"Glass Trust\\", it included 10 plants, had a 65 percent share of the U.S. plate glass market, and had become the nation's second largest producer of paint. Today, known as PPG Industries, the company is a multibillion-dollar, Fortune 500 corporation with 150 manufacturing locations around the world. It now produces coatings, glass, fiberglass, and chemicals. Pitcairn served as a director of PPG from its start, its president from 1897 to 1905, and chairman of the board from 1894 until his death. 20th century On 19 December 1968 the company changed its name to PPG Industries, Inc., to show its diverse offerings. Ditzler Color Company, established in 1902 in Detroit as an automotive color concern, was purchased by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG) in 1928. In the mid-1980s, Cipisa, a Spanish paint company was acquired and renamed PPG Ib√©rica. The CEO of Cipisa, Pere Nadal Carres became CEO of PPG Ib√©rica. In 1990 PPG founded Transitions Optical as a joint venture with Essilor. 21st century In October 2000, PPG Industries announced it had agreed to buy Courtaulds Aerospace for $512.5 million. Based in Glendale, California, the aerospace business has annual sales of approximately $240 million, employs 1,200 people. It manufactures sealants in Glendale, California, US and Shildon, England; coatings and sealants in Mojave, California, US; glazing sealants at Gloucester City, New Jersey, US; and coatings at Gonfreville, France. The business also operates 14 application-support centers in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. In 2006, the company rolled out a two-tiered pay system which resulted in massive strikes at union locations across the country. The system, now in place company-wide for non-salaried employees, provides lower rates of pay and fewer benefits to those employed after the roll-out than those employed before the roll-out. In West Virginia, US after a bitter five-month strike, the company still refused to eliminate the two-tiered system. In Lake Charles, Louisiana, US, the employment contracts of union employees had to be extended during a strike regarding the two-tiered system. In 2007, the company was involved in a lawsuit on failing to disclose a purchase reduction of its two major auto glass customers. On 2 January 2008, PPG acquired the SigmaKalon Group of companies for $3.2 billion from private investment firm Bain Capital, strongly increasing its paint and specialty coatings business. In 2008, PPG renamed their automotive glass division PGW (Pittsburgh Glass Works) and sold a majority of it to Kohlberg & Company. PPG retained 40% ownership of PGW until March 2016 when they sold their stake to automotive parts salvage company LKQ Corporation. In 2012, PPG acquired Dyrup A/S, founded in Denmark in 1928 as S. Dyrup & Co A/S by Sigurd Dyrup and Axel Monberg and Ejnar Thorsen of MT H√∏jgaard, some of whose brands are Dyrup, GORI (outdoor woodcare paint), and Bondex.

In October 2016, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announced the acquisition of the naming rights to Consol Energy Center by PPG; the facility will be known as PPG Paints Arena. In September 2017, PPG announced the sale of its remaining fiberglass operations to Nippon Electric Glass for $541 million. This was following PPG's 2016 sale of its European fiberglass operations to NEG, and divesting its ownership in two other Asian fiberglass joint ventures. =Attempted acquisition of AkzoNobel= In March 2017, the company launched an unsolicited takeover bid of ‚Ç¨20.9 billion, which was promptly rejected by AkzoNobel‚Äôs management. Days later, the company launched an increased bid of ‚Ç¨24.5 billion ($26.3 billion), which was again rejected by AkzoNobel‚Äôs management. A number of shareholders urged AkzoNobel to explore the offer and subsequent negotiations. In April, activist investor Elliot Investors called for the removal of the Chairman of Akzo, Antony Burgmans, following Akzo's refusal to enter talks with PPG. Elliott, which has a 3.25% stake in the company, claimed it was one of a group of investors that met the Dutch legal threshold of 10% voting-share support, which is needed to call an extraordinary meeting to vote on a proposal to remove Burgmans. On April 13, Templeton Global Equity said it was among another group of investors calling for an extraordinary meeting of AkzoNobel shareholders to discuss Burgmans' continued tenure as Chairman. Later in the same month Akzo outlined its plan to separate its chemicals division and pay shareholders ‚Ç¨1.6 billion in extra dividends, in order to attempt to hold off PPG. The new Akzo strategy was dismissed by PPG, which claimed that their offer represented better value for shareholders, supported by activist Akzo shareholder Elliot Advisors. On April 24, a day before Akzo's annual meeting of shareholders, PPG increased its final offer by approximately 8% to $28.8 billion (‚Ç¨26.9 billion, ‚Ç¨96.75 per share), with Akzo's share price rising 6% to a record of ‚Ç¨82.95 per share. Akzo shareholder Columbia Threadneedle Investments urged the company to open dialogue with PPG, whilst PPG claimed that the deal would add to earning within its first year. Great Britain's largest pension scheme investors, Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), urged Akzo to engage with PPG. On 2 May, Reuters revealed that the supervisory board of Akzo was meeting to discuss how to deal with PPG's third offer, still maintaining it did not value the company highly enough. In early May, Akzo again rejected PPG's bid, citing the deal still undervalues the company, as well as potentially facing antitrust risks, and not addressing other concerns such as \\"cultural differences\\". Under Dutch company law, PPG must now decide to either make a formal bid or walk away. In early June PPG chose to abandon pursuit. Environmental record Remediation at Canal Crossing, Jersey City. In November 2010, PPG agreed to remove 700,000 tons of toxic waste from Canal Crossing, a brownfield site in Jersey City, New Jersey where the company operated a chromium processing plant between 1954 and 1963.

Little is known about his early life; the first reliable records about him are documents recording his service in the Revolutionary War where he served as a lieutenant in the Continental Army and a colonel in the Virginia militia. After his service in the war, Greenup helped settle the trans-Appalachian regions of Virginia. He became involved in politics, and played an active role in three of the ten statehood conventions that secured the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792. He became one of the state's first representatives, and served in the Kentucky General Assembly before being elected governor in a race where, due to his immense popularity, he ran unopposed. Greenup's term in office was marred by accusations that he had participated in the Burr Conspiracy to align Kentucky with Spain prior to the former's separation from Virginia, but he vigorously and successfully rebutted these charges. Following his term as governor, he became less active in the political arena. He died on April 27, 1818. Greenup County, Kentucky and its county seat were both named in his honor. Early life in Virginia Christopher Greenup was most likely born in Fairfax County in the Virginia Colony around 1750.Harrison, p. 388 His parents were John and Elizabeth (Witten) Greenup.Encyclopedia of Kentucky, p. 72 His early education was attained at the local schools of the area. He learned surveying and studied law under Colonel Charles Binns at Charles City County, Virginia.NGA Bio During the Revolutionary War, he first served as a lieutenant on the Continental Line and later attained the rank of colonel in the Virginia militia.Trowbridge, \\"Kentucky's Military Governors\\" In 1781, Greenup helped settle the area now known as Lincoln County, Kentucky where he spent time as a surveyor and a land speculator.Harrison, pp. 388‚Äì389 He was admitted to practice law in the county court in 1782.Hopkins, p. 12 Following Virginia's creation of Kentucky County in 1783, he was admitted to the bar of the district court of Harrodsburg and served as clerk from 1785 to 1792. In 1783, he became one of the original trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later to become Transylvania University.) He purchased two lots of land in Lexington and served as the clerk of the town's trustees. In 1785, Greenup was elected to represent Fayette County for a single term in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his service, he was appointed to a committee with Benjamin Logan and James Garrard to make recommendations on ways to further divide the area that would become Kentucky.Everman, p. 4 The committee was also responsible for revising acts and surveys related to land and water surveys in the area. The committee ultimately recommended the creation of three new counties - Bourbon, Madison, and Mercer. When Mercer County was created later that year, Greenup was appointed a justice there. During this time, Greenup continued to practice law in Fayette County and pursued various other interests. He was a founding member of the Danville Political Club and in 1787, he joined the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge. Future Kentucky Governors Isaac Shelby and James Garrard, as well as future Supreme Court justice Thomas Todd were also members of the Society.Everman, p. 20 In 1789, he helped organize the Kentucky Manufacturing Society. Later, he was appointed to the Kentucky River Company, a group dedicated to improving infrastructure on the Kentucky River. On July 9, 1787, during a brief return to Virginia, Greenup married Mary Catherine (\\"Cathy\\") Pope of Hanover County, Virginia; the couple had two children ‚Äì Nancy and William. Political career in Kentucky Greenup served as clerk of the first Kentucky statehood convention in Danville in 1784. He was elected as a delegate to the second and sixth statehood conventions in 1785 and 1788, respectively, and was a trustee of the city of Danville in 1787.Powell, p. 18 H.E. Everman, biographer of fellow delegate James Garrard, noted that despite Greenup's excellent legal background and legislative experience, his lack of oratorical skills prevented him from taking more of a leadership role in the conventions.Everman, p. 26 When Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792, Greenup moved to Frankfort where he was rewarded for his efforts on behalf of the state by being chosen as an elector for the state's senators and governor. He also served in the first Kentucky Senate.Hopkins, p. 13 Following this, he was appointed to the court of oyer and terminer, but resigned immediately to accept a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.Harrison, p. 389 He was one of Kentucky's first two representatives in the House, and was elected to three successive terms, serving from November 9, 1792 to March 3, 1797. In 1798, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing Mercer County. He also served as clerk of the state senate from 1799 to 1802. Greenup was a candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1800, but was runner-up to James Garrard in a four-man race that also included Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd.Powell, p. 16 Greenup garnered a majority of the vote in fifteen counties, just one fewer than Garrard, but Garrard enjoyed strong support in the populous central Kentucky counties and received 8,390 votes, compared with 6,746 for Greenup, 3,996 for Logan, and 2,166 for Todd.Everman, pp. 64-65 Garrard appointed Greenup judge of the circuit court in 1802. After the Kentucky Senate refused to confirm Garrard's Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, as registrar of the land office, Garrard nominated Greenup.Everman, p. 76 Greenup, however, intended to make another run at the governorship, and at his request, Garrard withdrew the nomination days later. Greenup resigned his circuit judgeship on June 5, 1804, to make another run for governor. Immensely popular, he ran unopposed, and served as governor from September 4, 1804 to September 1, 1808. During Greenup's administration, the state chartered the Bank of Kentucky and the Ohio Canal Company; Greenup became a director of the former in 1807. Despite his popularity, however, he was unable to pass much of his proposed agenda, which included provision of public education and reforms to the militia, courts, revenue system, and penal system. A partisan Frankfort newspaper implicated Greenup in the Burr conspiracy, but he successfully defended himself and preserved his reputation. He deployed the Kentucky militia along the Ohio River to defend the state from any threat that might result from the Burr conspiracy, but that threat had largely dissipated by 1807. On October 22, 1807, Greenup's wife Mary died in the Governor's Mansion.Clark, p. 13Speed, p. 56 According to legend, her ghostly image has appeared in clock faces and mirrors inside the mansion. Following his term as governor, Greenup was chosen as a presidential elector for the ticket of James Madison and George Clinton. In 1812, he became a justice of the peace in Franklin County. In August 1812, Kentucky Secretary of State Martin D. Hardin recommended to Governor Isaac Shelby that Greenup be appointed Assistant Secretary of State.\\"Secretary of State Christopher Greenup\\". Kentucky Secretary of State Shelby made the appointment, and when Hardin, resigned December 15, 1812, Shelby nominated Greenup as his replacement. The Kentucky Senate approved the nomination on February 3, 1813, and Greenup served until his resignation on March 13, 1813. Greenup died April 27, 1818, at Blue Lick Springs Resort, where he had traveled seeking relief from his rheumatism. He is buried in the Frankfort Cemetery.Congressional Biography Greenup County, Kentucky was named in his honor, as was its county seat of Greenup, Kentucky. Footnotes The Biographical Directory of the United States Congress gives Greenup's place of birth as Westmoreland County, Virginia. Hopkins states that Greenup's will included six childrentwo sons and four daughters.

It is measured using a stadiometer, usually in centimetres when using the metric system, or feet and inches when using the imperial system. In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences. A particular genetic profile in men called Y haplotype I-M170 is correlated with height. Ecological data shows that as the frequency of this genetic profile increases in the population, the average male height in a country also increases. Height is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy. Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the ‚Äúlongevity gene‚Äù FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. Short stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency. When populations share genetic background and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism, which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities.Ganong, William F. (2001) Review of Medical Physiology, Lange Medical, pp. 392‚Äì397, . The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health. In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions. Height is a sexually dimorphic trait in humans. A study of 20th century British natality trends indicated that while tall men tended to reproduce more than short men, women of below average height had more children than taller women.https://www.livescience.com/22179-evolutionary-battle-sexes-height.html Determinants of growth and height The median (50th percentile) growth curves for male and females 0‚Äì20 years in the United States. The study of height is known as auxology.Hermanussen, Michael (ed) (2013) Auxology ‚Äì Studying Human Growth and Development, Schweizerbart, . Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts. For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations. Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential in regard to differences among populations. Average height is relevant to the measurement of the health and wellness (standard of living and quality of life) of populations. Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper medical care and adequate nutrition are relatively equally distributed. The uneven distribution of nutritional resources makes it more plausible for individuals with better access to resources to grow taller, while the other population group who does not have so much of a nutritious food availability height growth is not as promising. Average (male) height in a nation is correlated with protein quality. Nations that consume more protein in the form of meat, dairy, eggs, and fish tend to be taller, while those that obtain more protein from cereals tend to be shorter. Therefore, populations with high cattle per capita and high consumption of dairy live longer and are taller. Historically, this can be seen in the cases of the United States, Argentina, New Zealand and Australia in the beginning of the 19th century. Moreover, when the production and consumption of milk and beef is taken to consideration, it can be seen why the Germanic people who lived outside of the ‚Äúimperium Romanum‚Äù were taller than those who lived at the heart of the Empire. Changes in diet (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations. Malnutrition including chronic undernutrition and acute malnutrition is known to have caused stunted growth in various populations. This has been seen in North Korea, parts of Africa, certain historical Europe, and other populations. Developing countries such as Guatemala have rates of stunting in children under 5 living as high as 82.2% in Totonicap√°n, and 49.8% nationwide. Height measurements are by nature subject to statistical sampling errors even for a single individual. In a clinical situation, height measurements are seldom taken more often than once per office visit, which may mean sampling taking place a week to several months apart. The smooth 50th percentile male and female growth curves illustrated above are aggregate values from thousands of individuals sampled at ages from birth to age 20. In reality, a single individual's growth curve shows large upward and downward spikes, partly due to actual differences in growth velocity, and partly due to small measurement errors. For example, a typical measurement error of plus or minus 0.5 cm may completely nullify 0.5 cm of actual growth resulting in either a \\"negative\\" 0.5 cm growth (due to overestimation in the previous visit combined with underestimation in the latter), up to a 1.5 cm growth (the first visit underestimating and the second visit overestimating) in the same elapsed time period between measurements. Note there is a discontinuity in the growth curves at age 2, which reflects the difference in recumbent length (with the child on his or her back), used in measuring infants and toddlers and standing height typically measured from age 2 onwards. Height, like other phenotypic traits, is determined by a combination of genetics and environmental factors. A child's height based on parental heights is subject to regression toward the mean, therefore extremely tall or short parents will likely have correspondingly taller or shorter offspring, but their offspring will also likely be closer to average height than the parents themselves. Genetic potential and a number of hormones, minus illness, is a basic determinant for height. Other factors include the genetic response to external factors such as diet, exercise, environment, and life circumstances. Humans grow fastest (other than in the womb) as infants and toddlers, rapidly declining from a maximum at birth to roughly age 2, tapering to a slowly declining rate, and then during the pubertal growth spurt (with an average girl starting her puberty and pubertal growth spurt at 10 years and an average boy starting his puberty and pubertal growth spurt at 12 years), a rapid rise to a second maximum (at around 11‚Äì12 years for female, and 13‚Äì14 years for male), followed by a steady decline to zero. On average, female growth speed trails off to zero at about 15 or 16 years, whereas the male curve continues for approximately 3 more years, going to zero at about 18‚Äì19. These are also critical periods where stressors such as malnutrition (or even severe child neglect) have the greatest effect. Moreover, the health of a mother throughout her life, especially during her critical period and pregnancy, has a role. A healthier child and adult develops a body that is better able to provide optimal prenatal conditions. The pregnant mother's health is important for herself but also for the fetus as gestation is itself a critical period for an embryo/fetus, though some problems affecting height during this period are resolved by catch-up growth assuming childhood conditions are good. Thus, there is a cumulative generation effect such that nutrition and health over generations influences the height of descendants to varying degrees. The age of the mother also has some influence on her child's height. Studies in modern times have observed a gradual increase in height with maternal age, though these early studies suggest that trend is due to various socio-economic situations that select certain demographics as being more likely to have a first birth early in the mother's life.Table 1. Association of 'biological' and demographic variables and height. Figures are coefficients (95% confidence intervals) adjusted for each of the variables shown in These same studies show that children born to a young mother are more likely to have below- average educational and behavioural development, again suggesting an ultimate cause of resources and family status rather than a purely biological explanation. It has been observed that first-born males are shorter than later-born males. However, more recently the reverse observation was made. The study authors suggest that the cause may be socio-economic in nature. = Nature versus nurture = The precise relationship between genetics and environment is complex and uncertain. Differences in human height is 60‚Äì80% heritable, according to several twin studies and has been considered polygenic since the Mendelian-biometrician debate a hundred years ago. A genome-wide association (GWA) study of more than 180,000 individuals has identified hundreds of genetic variants in at least 180 loci associated with adult human height. The number of individuals has since been expanded to 253,288 individuals and the number of genetic variants identified is 697 in 423 genetic loci. In a separate study of body proportion using sitting-height ratio, it reports that these 697 variants can be partitioned into 3 specific classes, (1) variants that primarily determine leg length, (2) variants that primarily determine spine and head length, or (3) variants that affect overall body size. This gives insights into the biological mechanisms underlying how these 697 genetic variants affect overall height. These loci do not only determine height, but other features or characteristics. As an example, 4 of the 7 loci identified for intracranial volume had previously been discovered for human height. The effect of environment on height is illustrated by studies performed by anthropologist Barry Bogin and coworkers of Guatemala Mayan children living in the United States. In the early 1970s, when Bogin first visited Guatemala, he observed that Mayan Indian men averaged in height and the women averaged . Bogin took another series of measurements after the Guatemalan Civil War, during which up to a million Guatemalans fled to the United States. He discovered that Maya refugees, who ranged from six to twelve years old, were significantly taller than their Guatemalan counterparts. By 2000, the American Maya were taller than the Guatemalan Maya of the same age, largely due to better nutrition and health care. Bogin also noted that American Maya children had relatively longer legs, averaging longer than the Guatemalan Maya (a significantly lower sitting height ratio). The Nilotic peoples of Sudan such as the Shilluk and Dinka have been described as some of the tallest in the world. Dinka Ruweng males investigated by Roberts in 1953‚Äì54 were on average tall, and Shilluk males averaged . The Nilotic people are characterized as having long legs, narrow bodies and short trunks, an adaptation to hot weather. However, male Dinka and Shilluk refugees measured in 1995 in Southwestern Ethiopia were on average only 176.4 cm and 172.6 cm tall, respectively. As the study points out, Nilotic people \\"may attain greater height if privileged with favourable environmental conditions during early childhood and adolescence, allowing full expression of the genetic material.\\" Before fleeing, these refugees were subject to privation as a consequence of the succession of civil wars in their country from 1955 to the present. The tallest living married couple are ex-basketball players Yao Ming and Ye Li (both of China) who measure 228.6 cm (7 ft 6 in) and 190.5 cm (6 ft 3 in) respectively, giving a combined height of 419.1 cm (13 ft 9 in). They married in Shanghai, China, on 6 August 2007. In Tibet, the khampas are known for their great height. Khampa males are on average 180 cm tall (5 ft 11 in). Process of growth The main pathways in the endocrine regulation of growth Growth in stature, determined by its various factors, results from the lengthening of bones via cellular divisions chiefly regulated by somatotropin (human growth hormone (hGH)) secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Somatotropin also stimulates the release of another growth inducing hormone Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mainly by the liver. Both hormones operate on most tissues of the body, have many other functions, and continue to be secreted throughout life; with peak levels coinciding with peak growth velocity, and gradually subsiding with age after adolescence. The bulk of secretion occurs in bursts (especially for adolescents) with the largest during sleep. The majority of linear growth occurs as growth of cartilage at the epiphysis (ends) of the long bones which gradually ossify to form hard bone. The legs compose approximately half of adult human height, and leg length is a somewhat sexually dimorphic trait, with men having proportionately longer legs. Some of this growth occurs after the growth spurt of the long bones has ceased or slowed. The majority of growth during growth spurts is of the long bones. Additionally, the variation in height between populations and across time is largely due to changes in leg length. The remainder of height consists of the cranium. Height is sexually dimorphic and statistically it is more or less normally distributed, but with heavy tails. It has been shown that a log-normal distribution fits the data equally well, besides guaranteeing a non-negative lower confidence limit, which could otherwise attain a non-physical negative height value for arbitrarily large confidence levels. Height abnormalities Female Stature vs Age (US CDC) Male Stature vs Age (US CDC) Most intra-population variance of height is genetic. Short stature and tall stature are usually not a health concern. If the degree of deviation from normal is significant, hereditary short stature is known as familial short stature and tall stature is known as familial tall stature. Confirmation that exceptional height is normal for a respective person can be ascertained from comparing stature of family members and analyzing growth trends for abrupt changes, among others. There are, however, various diseases and disorders that cause growth abnormalities. Most notably, extreme height may be pathological, such as gigantism resulting from childhood hyperpituitarism, and dwarfism which has various causes. Rarely, no cause can be found for extreme height; very short persons may be termed as having idiopathic short stature. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003 approved hGH treatment for those 2.25 standard deviations below the population mean (approximately the lowest 1.2% of the population). An even rarer occurrence, or at least less used term and recognized \\"problem\\", is idiopathic tall stature. If not enough growth hormone is produced and/or secreted by the pituitary gland, then a patient with growth hormone deficiency can undergo treatment. This treatment involves the injection of pure growth hormone into thick tissue to promote growth. Role of an individual's height =Height and health= Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the ‚Äúlongevity gene‚Äù FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. Short stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency. Certain studies have shown that height is a factor in overall health while some suggest tallness is associated with better cardiovascular health and shortness with longevity. Cancer risk has also been found to grow with height. Moreover, scientists have also observed a protective effect of height on risk for Alzheimer's disease, although this fact could be a result of the genetic overlap between height and intracraneal volume and there are also genetic variants influencing height that could affect biological mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease etiology, such as Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Nonetheless, modern westernized interpretations of the relationship between height and health fail to account for the observed height variations worldwide.Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., & Cavalli-Sforza, F., 1995, The Great Human Diasporas, Cavalli-Sforza and Cavalli-Sforza note that variations in height worldwide can be partly attributed to evolutionary pressures resulting from differing environments. These evolutionary pressures result in height related health implications. While tallness is an adaptive benefit in colder climates such as found in Europe, shortness helps dissipate body heat in warmer climatic regions. Consequently, the relationships between health and height cannot be easily generalized since tallness and shortness can both provide health benefits in different environmental settings. At the extreme end, being excessively tall can cause various medical problems, including cardiovascular problems, because of the increased load on the heart to supply the body with blood, and problems resulting from the increased time it takes the brain to communicate with the extremities. For example, Robert Wadlow, the tallest man known to verifiable history, developed trouble walking as his height increased throughout his life. In many of the pictures of the later portion of his life, Wadlow can be seen gripping something for support. Late in his life, although he died at age 22, he had to wear braces on his legs and walk with a cane; and he died after developing an infection in his legs because he was unable to feel the irritation and cutting caused by his leg braces. Sources are in disagreement about the overall relationship between height and longevity. Samaras and Elrick, in the Western Journal of Medicine, demonstrate an inverse correlation between height and longevity in several mammals including humans. Women whose height is under may have a small pelvis, resulting in such complications during childbirth as shoulder dystocia. A study done in Sweden in 2005 has shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between height and suicide among Swedish men. A large body of human and animal evidence indicates that shorter, smaller bodies age more slowly, and have fewer chronic diseases and greater longevity. For example, a study found eight areas of support for the \\"smaller lives longer\\" thesis. These areas of evidence include studies involving longevity, life expectancy, centenarians, male vs. female longevity differences, mortality advantages of shorter people, survival findings, smaller body size due to calorie restriction, and within species body size differences. They all support the conclusion that smaller individuals live longer in healthy environments and with good nutrition. However, the difference in longevity is modest. Several human studies have found a loss of 0.5 year/centimetre of increased height (1.2 yr/inch). But these findings do not mean that all tall people die young. Many live to advanced ages and some become centenarians.Samaras TT 2014, Evidence from eight different types of studies showing smaller body size is related to greater longevity JSRR 3(16):2150-2160. 2014: article no. JSRR.2014.16.003 In medicine, height is measured to monitor child development, this is a better indicator of growth than weight on the long term.https://bettercare.co.za/learn/child-healthcare/text/03.html For older people, excessive height loss is a symptom of osteoporosis.https://www.osteoporosis.ca/multimedia/pdf/osteoporosis_month_2012.pdf Height is also used to compute indicators like body surface area or body mass index. =Height and occupational success= There is a large body of research in psychology, economics, and human biology that has assessed the relationship between several seemingly innocuous physical features (e.g., body height) and occupational success. The correlation between height and success was explored decades ago. Shorter people are considered to have an advantage in certain sports (e.g., gymnastics, race car driving, etc.), whereas in many other sports taller people have a major advantage. In most occupational fields, body height is not relevant to how well people are able to perform; nonetheless several studies found that success was positively correlated with body height, although there may be other factors such as gender or socioeonomic status that are correlated with height which may account for the difference in success. A demonstration of the height-success association can be found in the realm of politics. In the United States presidential elections, the taller candidate won 22 out of 25 times in the 20th century. Nevertheless, Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, was and several prominent world leaders of the 20th century, such as Vladimir Lenin, Benito Mussolini, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and Joseph Stalin were of below average height. These examples, however, were all before modern forms of multi-media, i.e., television, which may further height discrimination in modern society. Further, growing evidence suggests that height may be a proxy for confidence, which is likewise strongly correlated with occupational success.Nickless, Rachel (28 November 2012) Lifelong confidence rewarded in bigger pay packets. Afr.com. Retrieved on 2 September 2013. =Sports= History of human height Average human height in the Eastern Mediterranean from the Upper Paleolithic (before 16,000 BC) period, through to 1996. Average adult height by year of birth, World Annual change in average female height by year of birth Annual change in average male height by year of birth In the 150 years since the mid-nineteenth century, the average human height in industrialised countries has increased by up to . However, these increases appear to have largely levelled off. Before the mid-nineteenth century, there were cycles in height, with periods of increase and decrease; however, apart from the decline associated with the transition to agriculture, examinations of skeletons show no significant differences in height from the neolithic revolution through the early-1800s. In general, there were no big differences in regional height levels throughout the nineteenth century. The only exceptions of this rather uniform height distribution were people in the Anglo-Saxon settlement regions who were taller than the average and people from Southeast Asia with below-average heights. However, at the end of the nineteenth century and in the middle of the first globalisation period, heights between rich and poor countries began to diverge. These differences did not disappear in the deglobalisation period of the two World wars. Baten and Blum (2014) find that in the nineteenth century, important determinants of height were the local availability of cattle, meat and milk as well as the local disease environment. In the late-twentieth century, however, technologies and trade became more important, decreasing the impact of local availability of agricultural products. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, people of European descent in North America were far taller than those in Europe and were the tallest in the world. The original indigenous population of Plains Native Americans was also among the tallest populations of the world at the time. Some studies also suggest that there existed the correlation between the height and the real wage, moreover, correlation was higher among the less developed countries. Interestingly, the difference in height between children from different social classes was already observed by age two. In the late-nineteenth century, the Netherlands was a land renowned for its short population, but today Dutch people are among the world's tallest with young men averaging tall. According to a study by economist John Komlos and Francesco Cinnirella, in the first half of the eighteenth century, the average height of an English male was 165 cm (5 ft 5 in), and the average height of an Irish male was 168 cm (5 ft 6 in). The estimated mean height of English, German, and Scottish soldiers was 163.6 cm ‚Äì 165.9 cm (5 ft 4.4 in ‚Äì 5 ft 5.3 in) for the period as a whole, while that of Irish was 167.9 cm (5 ft 6.1 in). The average height of male slaves and convicts in North America was 171 cm (5 ft 7 in). American-born colonial soldiers of the late-1770s were on average more than 7.6 cm (3 inches) taller than their English counterparts who served in the Royal Marines at the same time. The average height of Americans and Europeans decreased during periods of rapid industrialisation, possibly due to rapid population growth and broad decreases in economic status. This has become known as the early-industrial growth puzzle or in the U.S. context the Antebellum Puzzle. In England during the early-nineteenth century, the difference between average height of English upper-class youth (students of Sandhurst Military Academy) and English working-class youth (Marine Society boys) reached 22 cm (8.7 in), the highest that has been observed. Data derived from burials show that before 1850, the mean stature of males and females in Leiden, The Netherlands was respectively 166.7 cm (5 ft 5.6 in) and 156.7 cm (5 ft 1.7 in). The average height of 19-year-old Dutch orphans in 1865 was 160 cm (5 ft 3 in). According to a study by J.W. Drukker and Vincent Tassenaar, the average height of a Dutch person decreased from 1830-57, even while Dutch real GNP per capita was growing at an average rate of more than 0.5% per year. The worst decline were in urban areas that in 1847, the urban height penalty was 2.5 cm (1 in). Urban mortality was also much higher than rural regions. In 1829, the average urban and rural Dutchman was 164 cm (5 ft 4.6 in). By 1856, the average rural Dutchman was 162 cm (5 ft 3.8 in) and urban Dutchman was 158.5 cm (5 ft 2.4 in). A 2004 report citing a 2003 UNICEF study on the effects of malnutrition in North Korea, due to \\"successive famines,\\" found young adult males to be significantly shorter. In contrast South Koreans \\"feasting on an increasingly Western-influenced diet,\\" without famine, were growing taller. The height difference is minimal for Koreans over forty years old, who grew up at a time when economic conditions in the North were roughly comparable to those in the South, while height disparities are most acute for Koreans who grew up in the mid-1990s ‚Äì a demographic in which South Koreans are about taller than their North Korean counterparts ‚Äì as this was a period during which the North was affected by a harsh famine where hundreds of thousands, if not millions, died of hunger. A study by South Korean anthropologists of North Korean children who had defected to China found that eighteen-year-old males were 5 inches (13 cm) shorter than South Koreans their age due to malnutrition. The tallest living man is Sultan K√∂sen of Turkey, at . The tallest man in modern history was Robert Pershing Wadlow (1918‚Äì1940), from Illinois, United States, who was at the time of his death. The tallest woman in medical history was Zeng Jinlian of Hunan, China, who stood when she died at the age of seventeen. The shortest adult human on record was Chandra Bahadur Dangi of Nepal at . Adult height between populations often differs significantly. For example, the average height of women from the Czech Republic is greater than that of men from Malawi. This may be caused by genetic differences, childhood lifestyle differences (nutrition, sleep patterns, physical labor), or both. Depending on sex, genetic and environmental factors, shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be universal in the extremely aged. This decrease in height is due to such factors as decreased height of inter-vertebral discs because of desiccation, atrophy of soft tissues and postural changes secondary to degenerative disease. Working on data of Indonesia, the study by Baten, Stegl and van der Eng suggests a positive relationship of economic development and average height. In Indonesia, human height has decreased coincidentally with natural or political shocks. Baten, J√∂rg; Stegl, Mojgan; van der Eng, Pierre: ‚ÄúLong-Term Economic Growth and the Standard of Living in Indonesia Average height around the world A textile label showing the difference in average height around the world as shown on this Polo shirt. What is a Medium size in the United States and in Europe becomes Large size for Asia As with any statistical data, the accuracy of such data may be questionable for various reasons: * Some studies may allow subjects to self-report values. Generally speaking, self-reported height tends to be taller than its measured height, although the overestimation of height depends on the reporting subject's height, age, gender and region. * Test subjects may have been invited instead of chosen at random, resulting in sampling bias. * Some countries may have significant height gaps between different regions. For instance, one survey shows there is gap between the tallest state and the shortest state in Germany.WWC Web World Center GmbH G.R.P. Institut f√ºr Rationelle Psychologie K√ñRPERMASSE BUNDESL√ÑNDER & ST√ÑDTE 31. Oktober 2007 Under such circumstances, the mean height may not represent the total population unless sample subjects are appropriately taken from all regions with using weighted average of the different regional groups. * Different social groups can show different mean height. According to a study in France, executives and professionals are taller, and university students are tallerAlthough the mean height of university students are slightly shorter than the national mean height aged 20-29 in this study. than the national average. As this case shows, data taken from a particular social group may not represent a total population in some countries. * A relatively small sample of the population may have been measured, which makes it uncertain whether this sample accurately represents the entire population. * The height of persons can vary over the course of a day, due to factors such as a height increase from exercise done directly before measurement (normally inversely correlated), or a height increase since lying down for a significant period of time (normally inversely correlated). For example, one study revealed a mean decrease of in the heights of 100 children from getting out of bed in the morning to between 4 and 5 p.m. that same day. Such factors may not have been controlled in some of the studies. * Men from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands, Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro have the tallest average height. Data suggests that Herzegovinians have the genetic potential to be more than two inches taller than the Dutch. In the Netherlands, about 35% of men have the genetic profile Y haplogroup I-M170, but in Herzegovina, the frequency is over 70%. Extrapolating the genetic trend line suggests that the average Herzegovinian man could possibly be as tall as 190 cm (nearly 6‚Ä≤ 3‚Ä≥). Many Herzegovinians do not achieve this potential due to poverty (citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were 1.9 cm taller if both of their parents went to university, which is considered as a wealth indicator), may be largely to blame for the shorter average stature of Muslim Herzegovinians.\\"Move Over, Dutch Men. Herzegovinians May Be Tallest in World\\" * Dinka people are sometimes noted for their height. With the Tutsi of Rwanda, they are believed to be the tallest people in Africa. Roberts and Bainbridge reported the average height of in a sample of 52 Dinka Agaar and in 227 Dinka Ruweng measured in 1953‚Äì1954. Other studies of comparative historical height data and nutrition place the Dinka as the tallest people in the world.Eveleth and Tanner (1976) Worldwide Variation in Human Growth, Cambridge University Press; --Floud et al 1990 Height, Health and History: Nutritional Status in the United Kingdom, 1750-1980, p. 6 Measurement Crown-rump length is the measurement of the length of human embryos and fetuses from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). It is typically determined from ultrasound imagery and can be used to estimate gestational age. Until two years old recumbent length is used to measure infants.https://www.ihs.gov/hwm/infantguidelines/ Length is the same as height, but height is measured standing up, whereas the way to measure the length is to lay the baby down and stretch a measuring tape from the top of the head to the bottom of the heel. In first world nations, the average total body length of a newborn is about , although premature newborns may be much smaller. Standing height is used to measure children over two years oldhttps://www.ihs.gov/hwm/childguidelines and adults who can stand without assistance. Measure is done with a stadiometer. In general, standing height is about 0.7 cm less than recumbent length.Measuring a child's growth p.19,World Health Organization Surrogate height measurements are used when standing height and recumbent length are impractical. For sample Chumlea equation use knee height as indicator of stature.

It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file, or encrypt a partition or the whole storage device (pre-boot authentication). On 28 May 2014, the TrueCrypt website announced that the project was no longer maintained and recommended users find alternative solutions. Though development of TrueCrypt has ceased, an independent audit of TrueCrypt (published in March 2015) has concluded that no significant flaws are present.  History  TrueCrypt was initially released as version 1.0 in February 2004, based on E4M (Encryption for the Masses). Several versions and many additional minor releases have been made since then, with the most current version being 7.1a. = E4M and SecurStar dispute = Original release of TrueCrypt was made by anonymous developers called \\"the TrueCrypt Team\\". Alt URL Shortly after version 1.0 was released in 2004, the TrueCrypt Team reported receiving email from Wilfried Hafner, manager of SecurStar, a computer security company. According to the TrueCrypt Team, Hafner claimed in the email that the acknowledged author of E4M, developer Paul Le Roux, had stolen the source code from SecurStar as an employee. It was further stated that Le Roux illegally distributed E4M, and authored an illegal license permitting anyone to base derivative work on the code and distribute it freely. Hafner alleges all versions of E4M always belonged only to SecurStar, and Le Roux did not have any right to release it under such a license. This led the TrueCrypt Team to immediately stop developing and distributing TrueCrypt, which they announced online through usenet. TrueCrypt Team member David Tesa≈ô√≠k stated that Le Roux informed the team that there was a legal dispute between himself and SecurStar, and that he received legal advisement not to comment on any issues of the case. Tesa≈ô√≠k concluded that should the TrueCrypt Team continue distributing TrueCrypt, Le Roux may ultimately be held liable and be forced to pay consequent damages to SecurStar. To continue in good faith, he said, the team would need to verify the validity of the E4M license. However, because of Le Roux's need to remain silent on the matter, he was unable to confirm or deny its legitimacy, keeping TrueCrypt development in limbo. Thereafter, would-be visitors reported trouble accessing the TrueCrypt website, and 3rd party mirrors appeared online making the source code and installer continually available, outside of official sanction by the TrueCrypt Team. In the FAQ section of its website, SecurStar maintains its claims of ownership over both E4M and Scramdisk, another free encryption program. The company states that with those products, SecurStar \\"had a long tradition of open source software\\", but that \\"competitors had nothing better to do but to steal our source code\\", causing the company to make its products closed- source, forcing potential customers to place a substantial order and sign a non-disclosure agreement before being allowed to review the code for security. Le Roux himself has denied developing TrueCrypt in a court hearing in March 2016, in which he also confirmed he had written E4M. = Version 2.0 = Months later on 7 June 2004, TrueCrypt 2.0 was released. The new version contained a different digital signature from that of the original TrueCrypt Team, with the developers now being referred to as \\"the TrueCrypt Foundation.\\" The software license was also changed to the open source GNU General Public License (GPL). However, given the wide range of components with differing licenses making up the software, and the contested nature of the legality of the program's release, a few weeks later on 21 June, version 2.1 was released under the original E4M license to avoid potential problems relating to the GPL license. Version 2.1a of the software was released on 1 October 2004 on \`truecrypt.sourceforge.net\` sub-domain. By May 2005, the original TrueCrypt website returned and \`truecrypt.sourceforge.net\` redirected visitors to \`truecrypt.org\`. = End of life announcement = On 28 May 2014, the TrueCrypt official website, \`truecrypt.org\`, began redirecting visitors to \`truecrypt.sourceforge.net\` with a HTTP 301 \\"Moved Permanently\\" status, which warned that the software may contain unfixed security issues, and that development of TrueCrypt was ended in May 2014, following Windows XP's end of support. The message noted that more recent versions of Windows have built-in support for disk encryption using BitLocker, and that Linux and OS X had similar built-in solutions, which the message states renders TrueCrypt unnecessary. The page recommends any data encrypted by TrueCrypt be migrated to other encryption setups and offered instructions on moving to BitLocker. The SourceForge project page for the software at \`sourceforge.net/truecrypt\` was updated to display the same initial message, and the status was changed to \\"inactive.\\" The page also announced a new software version, 7.2, which only allows decryption. Initially, the authenticity of the announcement and new software was questioned. Multiple theories attempting to explain the reason behind the announcement arose throughout the tech community. Shortly after the end of life announcement of TrueCrypt, Gibson Research Corporation posted an announcement titled \\"Yes... TrueCrypt is still safe to use\\" and a Final Release Repository to host the last official non-crippled version 7.1a of TrueCrypt.  Operating systems  TrueCrypt supports Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these operating systems are supported, except for Windows IA-64 (not supported) and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (runs as a 32-bit process). The version for Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP can encrypt the boot partition or entire boot drive. = Independent implementations = There is an independent, compatible implementation, tcplay, for DragonFly BSD and Linux. The Dm-crypt module included in default Linux kernel supports a TrueCrypt target called \\"tcw\\" since Linux version 3.13.  Encryption scheme  = Algorithms = Individual ciphers supported by TrueCrypt are AES, Serpent, and Twofish. Additionally, five different combinations of cascaded algorithms are available: AES-Twofish, AES-Twofish-Serpent, Serpent-AES, Serpent-Twofish-AES and Twofish-Serpent. The cryptographic hash functions available for use in TrueCrypt are RIPEMD-160, SHA-512, and Whirlpool. = Modes of operation = TrueCrypt currently uses the XTS mode of operation. Prior to this, TrueCrypt used LRW mode in versions 4.1 through 4.3a, and CBC mode in versions 4.0 and earlier. XTS mode is thought to be more secure than LRW mode, which in turn is more secure than CBC mode. Although new volumes can only be created in XTS mode, TrueCrypt is backward compatible with older volumes using LRW mode and CBC mode. Later versions produce a security warning when mounting CBC mode volumes and recommend that they be replaced with new volumes in XTS mode. = Keys = The header key and the secondary header key (XTS mode) are generated using PBKDF2 with a 512-bit salt and 1000 or 2000 iterations, depending on the underlying hash function used.  Plausible deniability  TrueCrypt supports a concept called plausible deniability, by allowing a single \\"hidden volume\\" to be created within another volume. In addition, the Windows versions of TrueCrypt have the ability to create and run a hidden encrypted operating system whose existence may be denied. The TrueCrypt documentation lists many ways in which TrueCrypt's hidden volume deniability features may be compromised (e.g. by third party software which may leak information through temporary files, thumbnails, etc., to unencrypted disks) and possible ways to avoid this. In a paper published in 2008 and focused on the then latest version (v5.1a) and its plausible deniability, a team of security researchers led by Bruce Schneier states that Windows Vista, Microsoft Word, Google Desktop, and others store information on unencrypted disks, which might compromise TrueCrypt's plausible deniability. The study suggested the addition of a hidden operating system functionality; this feature was added in TrueCrypt 6.0. When a hidden operating system is running, TrueCrypt also makes local unencrypted filesystems and non-hidden TrueCrypt volumes read-only to prevent data leaks. The security of TrueCrypt's implementation of this feature was not evaluated because the first version of TrueCrypt with this option had only recently been released. There was a functional evaluation of the deniability of hidden volumes in an earlier version of TrueCrypt by Schneier et al. that found security leaks.Schneier, UW Team Show Flaw In TrueCrypt Deniability. Accessed on: 12 June 2012 = Identifying TrueCrypt volumes = When analyzed, TrueCrypt volumes appear to have no header and contain random data.Piccinelli, Mario, and Paolo Gubian. \\"Detecting Hidden Encrypted Volume Files via Statistical Analysis.\\" International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics (IJCSDF) 3.1 (2014): 30-37. TrueCrypt volumes have sizes that are multiples of 512 due to the block size of the cipher mode and key data is either 512 bytes stored separately in the case of system encryption or two 128 kB headers for non-system containers. Forensics tools may use these properties of file size, apparent lack of a header, and randomness tests to attempt to identify TrueCrypt volumes. Although these features give reason to suspect a file to be a TrueCrypt volume, there are, however, some programs which exist for the purpose of securely erasing files by employing a method of overwriting file contents, and free disk space, with purely random data (i.e. \\"shred\\" & \\"scrub\\"), thereby creating reasonable doubt to counter pointed accusations declaring a file, made of statistically random data, to be a TrueCrypt file. If a system drive, or a partition on it, has been encrypted with TrueCrypt, then only the data on that partition is deniable. When the TrueCrypt boot loader replaces the normal boot loader, an offline analysis of the drive can positively determine that a TrueCrypt boot loader is present and so lead to the logical inference that a TrueCrypt partition is also present. Even though there are features to obfuscate its purpose (i.e. displaying a BIOS-like message to misdirect an observer such as, \\"Non-system disk\\" or \\"disk error\\"), these reduce the functionality of the TrueCrypt boot loader and do not hide the content of the TrueCrypt boot loader from offline analysis.TrueCrypt FAQ - see question I use pre-boot authentication. Can I prevent a person (adversary) that is watching me start my computer from knowing that I use TrueCrypt? Here again, the use of a hidden operating system is the suggested method for retaining deniability.  Performance  TrueCrypt supports parallelized encryption for multi-core systems and, under Microsoft Windows, pipelined read/write operations (a form of asynchronous processing) to reduce the performance hit of encryption and decryption. On newer processors supporting the AES-NI instruction set, TrueCrypt supports hardware- accelerated AES to further improve performance. The performance impact of disk encryption is especially noticeable on operations which would normally use direct memory access (DMA), as all data must pass through the CPU for decryption, rather than being copied directly from disk to RAM. In a test carried out by Tom's Hardware, although TrueCrypt is slower compared to an unencrypted disk, the overhead of real-time encryption was found to be similar regardless of whether mid-range or state-of-the-art hardware is in use, and this impact was \\"quite acceptable\\". In another article the performance cost was found to be unnoticeable when working with \\"popular desktop applications in a reasonable manner\\", but it was noted that \\"power users will complain\\". = Incompatibility with FlexNet Publisher and SafeCast = Installing third- party software which uses FlexNet Publisher or SafeCast (which are used for preventing software piracy on products by Adobe such as Adobe Photoshop) can damage the TrueCrypt bootloader on Windows partitions/drives encrypted by TrueCrypt and render the drive unbootable. This is caused by the inappropriate design of FlexNet Publisher writing to the first drive track and overwriting whatever non-Windows bootloader exists there.  Security concerns  TrueCrypt is vulnerable to various known attacks which are also present in other software-based disk encryption software such as BitLocker. To prevent those, the documentation distributed with TrueCrypt requires users to follow various security precautions. Some of those attacks are detailed below. = Encryption keys stored in memory = TrueCrypt stores its keys in RAM; on an ordinary personal computer the DRAM will maintain its contents for several seconds after power is cut (or longer if the temperature is lowered). Even if there is some degradation in the memory contents, various algorithms can intelligently recover the keys. This method, known as a cold boot attack (which would apply in particular to a notebook computer obtained while in power-on, suspended, or screen-locked mode), has been successfully used to attack a file system protected by TrueCrypt. = Physical security = TrueCrypt documentation states that TrueCrypt is unable to secure data on a computer if an attacker physically accessed it and TrueCrypt is used on the compromised computer by the user again (this does not apply to a common case of a stolen, lost, or confiscated computer). The attacker having physical access to a computer can, for example, install a hardware/software keylogger, a bus-mastering device capturing memory, or install any other malicious hardware or software, allowing the attacker to capture unencrypted data (including encryption keys and passwords), or to decrypt encrypted data using captured passwords or encryption keys. Therefore, physical security is a basic premise of a secure system. Attacks such as this are often called \\"evil maid attacks\\". = Malware = TrueCrypt documentation states that TrueCrypt cannot secure data on a computer if it has any kind of malware installed. Malware may log keystrokes, thus exposing passwords to an attacker. = The \\"Stoned\\" bootkit = The \\"Stoned\\" bootkit, an MBR rootkit presented by Austrian software developer Peter Kleissner at the Black Hat Technical Security Conference USA 2009, has been shown capable of tampering TrueCrypt's MBR, effectively bypassing TrueCrypt's full volume encryption. Potentially every hard disk encryption software is affected by this kind of attack if the encryption software does not rely on hardware-based encryption technologies like TPM, or if the attack is made with administrative privileges while the encrypted operating system is running. Two types of attack scenarios exist in which it is possible to maliciously take advantage of this bootkit: in the first one, the user is required to launch the bootkit with administrative privileges once the PC has already booted into Windows; in the second one, analogously to hardware keyloggers, a malicious person needs physical access to the user's TrueCrypt-encrypted hard disk: in this context this is needed to modify the user's TrueCrypt MBR with that of the Stoned bootkit and then place the hard disk back on the unknowing user's PC, so that when the user boots the PC and types his/her TrueCrypt password on boot, the \\"Stoned\\" bootkit intercepts it thereafter because, from that moment on, the Stoned bootkit is loaded before TrueCrypt's MBR in the boot sequence. The first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices, e.g. avoid running non- trusted executables with administrative privileges. The second one can be successfully neutralized by the user if he/she suspects that the encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone he/she does not trust, by booting the encrypted operating system with TrueCrypt's Rescue Disk instead of booting it directly from the hard disk. With the rescue disk, the user can restore TrueCrypt's MBR to the hard disk. = Trusted Platform Module = The FAQ section of the TrueCrypt website states that the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cannot be relied upon for security, because if the attacker has physical or administrative access to the computer and you use it afterwards, the computer could have been modified by the attacker e.g. a malicious component‚Äîsuch as a hardware keystroke logger‚Äîcould have been used to capture the password or other sensitive information. Since the TPM does not prevent an attacker from maliciously modifying the computer, TrueCrypt will not support the TPM.  Security audits  In 2013 a graduate student at Concordia University published a detailed online report, in which he states that he has confirmed the integrity of the distributed Windows binaries of version 7.1a. A crowdfunding campaign attempting to conduct an independent security audit of TrueCrypt was successfully funded in October 2013. A non-profit organization called the Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP) was formed, calling itself \\"a community-driven global initiative which grew out of the first comprehensive public audit and cryptanalysis of the widely used encryption software TrueCrypt\\". The organization established contact with TrueCrypt developers, who welcomed the audit. Phase I of the audit was successfully completed on 14 April 2014, finding \\"no evidence of backdoors or malicious code\\". Matthew D. Green, one of the auditors, added \\"I think it's good that we didn't find anything super critical.\\" One day after TrueCrypt's end of life announcement, OCAP confirmed that the audit would continue as planned, with Phase II expected to begin in June 2014 and wrap up by the end of September. The Phase II audit was delayed, but was completed 2 April 2015 by NCC Cryptography Services. This audit \\"found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances.\\" The French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) stated that while TrueCrypt 6.0 and 7.1a have previously attained ANSSI certification, migration to an alternate certified product is recommended as a precautionary measure. According to Gibson Research Corporation, Steven Barnhart wrote to an email address for a TrueCrypt Foundation member he had used in the past and received several replies from \\"David\\". According to Barnhart, the main points of the email messages were that the TrueCrypt Foundation was \\"happy with the audit, it didn't spark anything\\", and that the reason for the announcement was that \\"there is no longer interest [in maintaining the project].\\" According to a study released 29 September 2015, TrueCrypt includes two vulnerabilities in the driver that TrueCrypt installs on Windows systems allowing an attacker arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation via DLL hijacking.http://www.pcworld.com/article/2987439/encryption/newly-found- truecrypt-flaw-allows-full-system-compromise.html In January 2016, the vulnerability was fixed in VeraCrypt,CVE-2016-1281: TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt Windows installers allow arbitrary code execution with elevation of privilege but it remains unpatched in TrueCrypt's unmaintained installers.  Legal cases  = Operation Satyagraha = In July 2008, several TrueCrypt-secured hard drives were seized from Brazilian banker Daniel Dantas, who was suspected of financial crimes. The Brazilian National Institute of Criminology (INC) tried unsuccessfully for five months to obtain access to his files on the TrueCrypt-protected disks. They enlisted the help of the FBI, who used dictionary attacks against Dantas' disks for over 12 months, but were still unable to decrypt them. = United States v. John Doe = In 2012 the United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a John Doe TrueCrypt user could not be compelled to decrypt several of his hard drives. The court's ruling noted that FBI forensic examiners were unable to get past TrueCrypt's encryption (and therefore were unable to access the data) unless Doe either decrypted the drives or gave the FBI the password, and the court then ruled that Doe's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent legally prevented the Government from making him or her do so.United States v. John Doe = David Miranda = On 18 August 2013 David Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, was detained at London's Heathrow Airport by Metropolitan Police while en route to Rio de Janeiro from Berlin. He was carrying with him an external hard drive said to be containing sensitive documents pertaining to the 2013 global surveillance disclosures sparked by Edward Snowden. Contents of the drive were encrypted by TrueCrypt, which authorities said \\"renders the material extremely difficult to access.\\" Detective Superintendent Caroline Goode stated the hard drive contained around 60 gigabytes of data, \\"of which only 20 have been accessed to date.\\" She further stated the process to decode the material was complex and \\"so far only 75 documents have been reconstructed since the property was initially received.\\" Guardian contributor Naomi Colvin concluded the statements were misleading, stating that it was possible Goode was not even referring to any actual encrypted material, but rather deleted files reconstructed from unencrypted, unallocated space on the hard drive, or even plaintext documents from Miranda's personal effects. Glenn Greenwald supported this assessment in an interview with Democracy Now!, mentioning that the UK government filed an affidavit asking the court to allow them to retain possession of Miranda's belongings. The grounds for the request were that they could not break the encryption, and were only able to access 75 of the documents that he was carrying, which Greenwald said \\"most of which were probably ones related to his school work and personal use.\\" = James DeSilva = In February 2014, an Arizona Department of Real Estate IT department employee, James DeSilva, was arrested on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor through the sharing of explicit images over the Internet. His computer, encrypted with TrueCrypt, was seized, and DeSilva refused to reveal the password. Forensics detectives from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office were unable to gain access to his stored files. = Lauri Love = In October 2013, British‚ÄìFinnish activist Lauri Love was arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on charges of hacking into a US department or agency computer and one count of conspiring to do the same. The government confiscated all of his electronics and demanded he provide them with the necessary keys to decrypt the devices. Love refused. On 10 May 2016 a District Judge (Magistrate's Court) rejected a request by the NCA that Love be forced to turn over his encryption keys or passwords to TrueCrypt files on an SD card and hard drives that were among the confiscated property. = Druking = In the special prosecutor investigation for Druking in South Korea, the special prosecutor decrypted some of the files encrypted by TrueCrypt by guessing the passphrase.[ÏùºÎ¨∏ÏùºÎãµ] ‚ÄòÎìúÎ£®ÌÇπ ÌäπÍ≤Ä‚Äô Ï¢ÖÎ£å‚Ä¶‚ÄúÏàòÏÇ¨ Ï¢ÖÎ£å ÏûêÏ≤¥ ÌåêÎã®‚Ä¶Ïô∏Ïïï ÏóÜÏóàÎã§‚Äù, NewsPim, 2018.08.27., http://newspim.com/news/view/20180827000369ÌäπÍ≤Ä \\"ÍπÄÍ≤ΩÏàò, ÌÇπÌÅ¨Îû© Í∞úÎ∞ú¬∑Ïö¥ÏòÅ ÌóàÎùΩ‚Ä¶ÎåìÍ∏Ä 8800ÎßåÍ±¥ Ï°∞Ïûë Í¥ÄÏó¨\\", Maeil Business Newspaper, 2018.08.27., http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2018&no;=538301 The special prosecutor said the hidden volumes were especially difficult to deal with.

Accessed on: 21 May 2012 TrueCrypt Collective License. Accessed on: 4 June 2014 It is not part of the panoply of widely used open source licenses and is not a free software license according to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) license list, as it contains distribution and copyright-liability restrictions. As of version 7.1a (the last full version of the software, released Feb 2012), the TrueCrypt License was version 3.0. Discussion of the licensing terms on the Open Source Initiative (OSI)'s license-discuss mailing list in October 2013 suggests that the TrueCrypt License has made progress towards compliance with the Open Source Definition but would not yet pass if proposed for certification as Open Source software. According to current OSI president Simon Phipps: > ...it is not at all appropriate for [TrueCrypt] to describe itself as \\"open > source.\\" This use of the term \\"open source\\" to describe something under a > license that's not only unapproved by OSI but known to be subject to issues > is unacceptable. As a result of its questionable status with regard to copyright restrictions and other potential legal issues,Tom Callaway of Red Hat about TrueCrypt licensing concern Accessed on 10 July 2009 the TrueCrypt License is not considered \\"free\\" by several major Linux distributions and is therefore not included in Debian,Debian Bug report logs - #364034. Accessed on: 12 January 2009. Ubuntu,Bug #109701 in Ubuntu. Accessed on: 20 April 2009 Fedora,TrueCrypt licensing concern Accessed on: 20 April 2009 or openSUSE.non- OSI compliant packages in the openSUSE Build Service. Accessed on: 20 April 2009 The wording of the license raises doubts whether those who use it have the right to modify it and use it within other projects. Cryptographer Matthew Green noted that \\"There are a lot of things [the developers] could have done to make it easier for people to take over this code, including fixing the licensing situation\\", and speculates that since they didn't do those things (including making the license more friendly), their intent was to prevent anyone from building on their code in the future. =End of life and license version 3.1= 28 May 2014 announcement of discontinuation of TrueCrypt also came with a new version 7.2 of the software. Among the many changes to the source code from the previous release were changes to the TrueCrypt License ‚Äî including removal of specific language that required attribution of TrueCrypt as well as a link to the official website to be included on any derivative products ‚Äî forming a license version 3.1. On 16 June 2014, the only alleged TrueCrypt developer still answering email replied to a message by Matthew Green asking for permission to use the TrueCrypt trademark for a fork released under a standard open source license. Permission was denied, which led to the two known forks being named VeraCrypt and CipherShed as well as a re- implementation named tc-play rather than TrueCrypt.  Trademarks  In 2007 a US trademark for TrueCrypt was registered under the name of Ondrej Tesarik with a company name TrueCrypt Developers Association (search trademark directory for \\"TrueCrypt\\") and a trademark on the \\"key\\" logo was registered under the name of David Tesarik with a company name TrueCrypt Developers Association. In 2009 the company name TrueCrypt Foundation was registered in the US by a person named David Tesarik. The TrueCrypt Foundation non-profit organization last filed tax returns in 2010, (search database for \\"TrueCrypt\\") and the company was dissolved in 2014.

Carmen, daughter of the village leader, searches for someone who can come to the rescue of her townspeople. While visiting a village church, she sees a silent film featuring \\"The Three Amigos\\", a trio of gunfighters who protect the vulnerable from villains. Believing them to be real heroes, Carmen sends a telegram asking them to come and stop El Guapo. Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms, and Ned Nederlander are silent film actors from Los Angeles, California, who portray the Amigos on screen. When they demand a salary increase, studio executive Harry Flugleman fires them. Shortly afterward, they receive Carmen's telegram but misinterpret it as an invitation to appear in character and perform a show for the people of Santo Poco. After breaking into the studio to retrieve their costumes, the Amigos head for Mexico. Stopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot, who arrived just before they did and who is also in search of El Guapo. The Amigos perform a musical at the Cantina, singing \\"My Little Buttercup\\", and leave the locals confused. The German's real associates then arrive at the cantina, proving themselves lethal with their pistols when everyone else laughs at them. A relieved Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are put up in the best house in town and pampered. The next morning, when three of El Guapo's men come to raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men bemused. The bandits ride off, making everyone think that the Amigos have defeated the enemy. In reality, the men inform El Guapo of what has happened, and he decides to return the next day and kill the Amigos. The village throws a victorious party for the Amigos. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call out the Amigos, but the Amigos think this is another show. After Lucky gets shot in the arm, the Amigos realize that these are real bandits and beg for mercy. El Guapo allows the Amigos to live, then has his men loot the village and kidnap Carmen. The Amigos leave Santo Poco in humiliation. Ned persuades Lucky and Dusty to go after El Guapo, saying that they have nothing worth going back to in America and this is their chance to be real heroes. They spot a cargo plane and follow it; the plane is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for the gang. Preparations are underway for El Guapo's 40th birthday party, and he plans to make Carmen his bride. The Amigos try to sneak into the hideout, with mixed results: Lucky is captured and chained up in a dungeon, Dusty crashes through a window into Carmen's room, and Ned ends up stuck, suspended from a pi√±ata. Lucky frees himself, but Dusty and Ned are held hostage. The German, having idolized Ned's quick-draw and gun spinning pistol skills since childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned kills the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape in the German's plane. Returning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves. Drawing inspiration from one of their old films, they have the villagers create improvised Amigos costumes. The bandits arrive, only to find themselves suddenly being shot at by Amigos from all sides and falling into hidden trenches dug by the villagers. El Guapo's men either ride off or are shot, and he takes a fatal wound as well. As he lies dying, the villagers, all dressed as Amigos, step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them, then shoots Lucky in the foot and dies. The villagers offer to give the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse it, saying (as in their movies) that \\"seeing justice done is enough of a reward for them\\". They then ride off into the sunset. Cast * Steve Martin as Lucky Day * Chevy Chase as Dusty Bottoms * Martin Short as Ned Nederlander * Alfonso Arau as El Guapo * Tony Plana as Jefe * Patrice Martinez as Carmen * Joe Mantegna as Harry Flugleman * Phil Hartman as Sam, one of Flugleman's assistants * Jon Lovitz as Morty, one of Flugleman's assistants * Tino Insana as The Studio Guard * Loyda Ramos as Conchita * Phillip Gordon as Rodrigo * Kai Wulff as the German * Norbert Weisser and Brian Thompson as the German's friends * Randy Newman as the Singing Bush * Rebecca Underwood as Hot Senorita (kisses Ned at the close of the film) Production The film was written by Martin, Michaels, and Randy Newman. According to Michaels, Martin approached him with the idea of the film and asked him to co-write it with him. Martin originally had the working title of Three Cabelleros, the same as the Disney cartoon. Newman contributed three original songs: \\"The Ballad of the Three Amigos,\\" \\"My Little Buttercup,\\" and \\"Blue Shadows,\\" while the musical score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. It was shot in Simi Valley, California; Coronado National Forest; Old Tucson Studios; and Hollywood. John Landis was on trial over the Twilight Zone tragedy during the editing of Three Amigos, and the studio heavily edited the film down after he submitted his final cut. The production went through many cast changes before filming. Since he is a co-screenwriter, Martin had been attached to the project since 1980 and he, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi were originally going to play the Three Amigos. At one point, Steven Spielberg was slated to direct; he wanted Martin, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams to portray Lucky, Dusty and Ned, respectively. Landis has said that Rick Moranis would have been cast as Ned, had Short been unavailable. When Aykroyd became unavailable, Chase replaced him. John Candy was set for the role originally intended for Belushi, as he did in the movie Armed and Dangerous, but he was too large to ride the horse. It was Candy who recommended Martin Short to Steve Martin, as they had worked together at SCTV. It was the first movie for Short, and he and Martin became close friends, and continue to perform together. Candy would prominently be seen later riding a horse in the 1991 film Delirious. Martin developed tinnitus after filming a pistol-shooting scene for the film. There were difficulties between the main actors and Landis. Most famously, it included a scene where Chase refused to tell a joke because he thought it would make his character look like a \\"moron.\\" Chase agreed to do the line after he threatened to give it to Short instead. =Deleted scenes= Several deleted scenes were included in the Blu- ray release. An alternate opening featured the peaceful village of Santo Poco being rampaged upon by El Guapo and his men, prompting Carmen's search for help. Extended sequences of the Three Amigos at the studio mansion and backlot lead into another deleted subplot involving an up-and-coming rival actress at the studio, Miss Rene (Fran Drescher). A deleted scene featuring Sam Kinison as a mountain man was lost, as were most of Drescher's other scenes. Music Elmer Bernstein wrote the score for Three Amigos and Randy Newman wrote the songs. # \\"The Ballad of the Three Amigos\\" # \\"Main Title\\" # \\"The Big Sneak\\" # \\"My Little Buttercup\\" # \\"Santo Poco\\" # \\"Fiesta and Flamenco\\" # \\"El Guapo\\" # \\"The Return of the Amigos\\" # \\"Blue Shadows on the Trail\\" # \\"The Singing Bush\\" # \\"Amigos at the Mission\\" # \\"Capture\\" # \\"El Guapo's Birthday\\" # \\"The Chase‚Äù # \\"Amigos, Amigos, Amigos\\" # \\"Farewell\\" # \\"End Credits\\" Reception =Box office= Three Amigos had a U.S. gross of $39.2 million. =Critical response= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 45% of 40 film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.16/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Three Amigos! stars a trio of gifted comedians and has an agreeably silly sense of humor, but they're often adrift in a dawdling story with too few laugh-out-loud moments.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film one out of four stars and said, \\"The ideas to make Three Amigos into a good comedy are here, but the madness is missing.\\"Roger Ebert's review of Three Amigos on Chicago Sun-Times website Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it was \\"likable\\" but lacked a \\"distinctive style\\", though certain jokes are crafted with \\"enjoyable sophistication\\". Caroline Wetsbrook of Empire awarded the film three out of five stars and wrote that it was \\"good-natured enough to sustain its ultimately thin premise\\". Despite this, the film has since been reviewed more favorably and has become a cult classic. Neil McNally of the website Den of Geek noted that the film was \\"unfairly overlooked\\" when first released, and praised the performances of Martin, Chase, and Short; the comedic scriptwriting of Landis; and the \\"sweeping, majestic\\" score by Bernstein. The film was ranked #79 on Bravo's list of the \\"100 Funniest Movies\\". Chevy Chase has described the making of this movie as \\"the most fun I‚Äôve ever had.\\"https://ew.com/article/2004/08/13/chevy-chase-reflects-his-best-work/ See also *List of films featuring fictional films References External links  * Category:1986 films Category:1980s Western (genre) comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American satirical films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Mexico Category:Films set in 1916 Category:Films shot in Arizona Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:American Western (genre) comedy films Category:Orion Pictures films Category:Films produced by Lorne Michaels Category:Films directed by John Landis Category:Films produced by George Folsey Jr. Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein Category:Films with screenplays by Steve Martin Category:1986 comedy films ","title":"Three Amigos"},{"id":"905984","text":"The Xavante (also Shavante, Chavante, Akuen, A'uwe, Akwe, Awen, or Akwen) are an indigenous people, comprising 15,315 individuals within the territory of eastern Mato Grosso state in Brazil. They speak the Xavante language, part of the J√™ language family. History They were enslaved in the 18th century,Giccaria, Bartolomeu. Xavante: Povo Aut√™ntico. Editora Salesiana Dom Bosco, 1984, p. 29 after which they have tried to avoid contact. A temporary coexistence with westernized society in the 19th century in the state of Goi√°s,Giccaria, Bartolomeu. Xavante: Povo Aut√™ntico. Editora Salesiana Dom Bosco, 1984, p. 35 was followed by withdrawal to Mato Grosso (between 1830‚Äì1860). They were \\"re-discovered\\" during the 1930s. From 1946 to 1957, they were brought under Get√∫lio Vargas‚Äô National Integration Program, but still experienced massacres and disease. Due to this history, they have a distrust of non-Xavante people. Today they are still wary of any approach of non-Xavante, called \\"waradzu\\". The Xavante leader M√°rio Juruna was the first indigenous Brazilian to become a federal representative. The Xavante, like other indigenous tribes, were treated badly by the government beginning in the 1960s, the Xavante were moved from their homeland in Mato Grosso to a southern, malnourished area of Brazil. There, thousands of natives died due to disease, famine and warfare. Within the last decade, the Xavante have been relocated back to their original lands. Unfortunately, due to landgrabbing and squatters, the land was destroyed. Lush forest was burned to create sparse wasteland and pasture. Recently, John Carter has aided the Xavante by donating 100 head of cattle to the tribe. He continually stands up for the people and is currently on friendly terms with the chief and the members. While their condition is still dire, surviving off of only rice and what little vegetables they can grow on their land, the Brazilian government is finally stepping in to help out the Xavante people. Genetic origins A 2015 genetic study reached a surprising conclusion about the origins of the Xavante people. Unlike other Native American peoples, the Paiter-Surui, Karitiana, and Xavante have an ancestry partially related to indigenous Australasian populations of the Andaman Islands, New Guinea, and Australia. Scientists speculate that the relationship derives from an earlier people, called \\"Population Y\\", in East Asia from whence both groups diverged 15,000 to 30,000 years ago, the future Australasians migrating south and the remote ancestors of the Xavante northward finding their way to the New World and to the interior Amazon Basin. Culture The people are renowned as beautiful and prideful. They may be most famous for their dualistic societal structure. Two clans, the √Çwaw·∫Ω and Po'reza'√µno compose the culture, and marriage is not allowed between members of the same clan. An example of inter-clan relationships are the traditional log races, where the two clans compete in a race to carry palm tree trunks weighing as much as 80 kg to a defined point. The Xavante are also known for their complex initiation rituals for young males, such as when small wooden sticks are inserted in the earlobes at the age of fourteen. As time passes, the size of these adornments is increased for the rest of their lives. In 1996 the Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura stayed and recorded with the Xavante people, who featured on their album Roots. A small number of Xavante even travelled to S√£o Paulo to partake in Sepultura's Barulho Contra Fome (Noise Against Hunger) concert in 1998 that marked the start of their tour for their follow-up album, Against where their presence was featured in the music video for the song \\"Choke\\".

Traditionally European countries have either developed their own weapon systems or bought 'off the shelf' systems usually NATO-sponsored from the United States or from the Soviet Union, now from Russia. In the modern era, reduced military budgets and increasing complexity make it difficult for most countries to develop their own weapon systems. Furthermore, identical projects in differing countries were recognised as a waste of resources. However the same countries often do not wish to purchase American systems because of the perception of a loss of sovereignty and the profits (and jobs) going to American companies. Likewise they hope to establish a profitable export competing the American one.A New Arms Race: Exports Booming for German Weapons Manufacturers - SPIEGEL ONLINE Therefore, some European nations are attempting to pool their resources to create multinational programmes to create a more independent and competitive capability. The European Defence Agency was established in 2004 to create such a stronger European market for military equipment. History The Eurofighter Typhoon is the latest in a line of joint aircraft projects between the Western European powers. Previously the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy had cooperated in producing the Panavia Tornado in the 1970s, and the UK and France had cooperated in producing the SEPECAT Jaguar. The Eurocopter Tiger is developed by France and Germany and was also bought by Spain. Franco-Italian naval projects include the Horizon class frigates and FREMM multipurpose frigates. European countries also purchase a great deal of hardware from the US, and many former Eastern bloc countries have a great deal of legacy equipment produced by the USSR and other Warsaw Pact regimes. Industry While European military budgets remain fragmented and massive duplication in research and development exists, the European military industry has made some moves towards consolidation. British Aerospace was widely expected to merge with Germany‚Äôs DASA to form the first major European military-industrial giant. Instead in 1999 BAe merged with another British company, GEC's military-industrial businesses (GEC-Marconi), to form BAE Systems which has tended to focus on the Anglo-American market. As a result, in 2000, DASA merged with Aerospatiale-Matra to form EADS. Further consolidation of the smaller military-industrial firms cannot be ruled out. In 2002 the formation of MBDA brought together the product portfolios of Aerospatiale Matra Missiles (of EADS), Alenia Marconi Systems missiles, and Matra BAe Dynamics to form Europe's No. 1 missile manufacturer and No. 2 globally after Raytheon. In 2015, the German Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and French Nexter merged under a joint holding company KMW+Nexter Defense Systems. Both companies are major producers of military land systems. Other major players include *AgustaWestland (merged into Leonardo-Finmeccanica since 2016) *Dassault Aviation *Damen Group *DCNS (now Naval Group) *Diehl Defence *Eurocopter *Eurofighter GmbH *IDV (Iveco Defense Vehicles) *Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace *Leonardo S.p.A. *Navantia *Patria (company) *Rheinmetall *Rolls-Royce *Saab Group *Safran *Thales Group *ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems Products Below are some examples of European products and the previously used weapons they may replace. *Aircraft and missiles: **A400M - replacing C-130 and Franco/German Transall **Eurofighter Typhoon - replacing F-4 Phantom II, F-16s, Mirage F-1, Tornado F.3 **Eurocopter Tiger - for France, Germany and Spain **EH101 and NH90 - largely replacing European helicopters **Meteor - replacing AMRAAM as long-range AAM **ASRAAM and IRIS-T - replacing AIM-9 Sidewinder as short-range AAM *Land vehicles: **ASCOD IFV equipping the Austrian, Spanish and British armies, Puma IFV equipping the Germany army **Patria AMV and GTK Boxer APCs equipping various European armies **ATF Dingo, Fennek, Iveco LMV tactical vehicles used by various countries **PzH 2000 - replacing M109 Paladin *Naval vessels: **F-100 Class Frigates replacing US designed Knox frigates in Spain, Oliver Hazard Perry frigates in Australia and Dealey class frigates in Norway. **Type 212 submarine, equipping the German, Italian navies, Type 214 submarine equipping the Greek and Portuguese navies, S-80 class submarine equipping the Spanish Navy **Horizon class frigate and FREMM multipurpose frigate both for the French and Italian navies **Rotterdam and Galicia class LPD, replacing Newport class tank landing ships in the Netherlands and Spanish Navies. There are several examples where one country continues to pursue purely national programmes because collaboration would be unacceptable or undesirable. For example, both the UK and France continue to develop and operate independent nuclear deterrent. Likewise France's desire for military and industrial independence has motivated its continued pursuit of high-technology projects, e.g. Dassault Rafale. Multinational programmes can fail because of disagreements about price or capability. For example, while the UK terminated its collaboration with France and Italy on the next generation frigate (Horizon CNGF) and started a national Type 45 programme. However the warships will share some systems, primarily the MBDA Aster missile. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair came under pressure from President Bill Clinton to select Raytheon's future missile to arm the Eurofighter, however the UK government selected the European Meteor air-to-air missile. The Meteor could be deemed riskier, however the Meteor armed Typhoon will not be subject to U.S. export controls and MBDA now has a missile product with no real competition from American manufacturers. Likewise European governments were actively dissuaded by the US Department of Defence from continuing the A400M project, the Pentagon argued that the Lockheed C-130J and Boeing C-17 provided all the capability European governments needed and were already flying. The DOD also argued that to spend limited budgetary resources on such duplication was foolish. The previous generation American fighter plane (F-16) was widely sold throughout Europe. Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders has called the difficulties in coordinating European investment in the A400M program a \\"horror\\", and said \\"I am determined, at least for my company, not to ever again walk into such a program\\". French President Macron and German Chancellor Merkel have signalled their countries intention to co-operate on the development of a future combat aircraft to be produced as a replacement for Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon.https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/franco-german-fighter- proposal-gains-momentum-439509/http://www.defensenews.com/articles/france-and- germany-agree-to-jointly-build-new-generation-fighter-jet  Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement  The European Union has adopted a code of conductThe Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement with the objective to inject transparency and competition into the military procurement.

Flag of the Philippines. The Spanish influence on Filipino culture has been profound, having originated from the Spanish East Indies. A variety of aspects of the customs and traditions in the Philippines today can be traced back to this influence.http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/humanitiesdiliman/article/viewFile/18/464 Background Spanish settlement in the Philippines first took place in the 1500s, during the Spanish colonial period of the islands. The conquistador Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi founded the first Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565, and later established Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies in 1571. The Philippine Islands are named after King Philip.filipino.com Spaniards are referred to by Filipinos as \\"Kastila\\" (Castilian) named after the former Kingdom of Castile, now a region of Spain. The majority of the Filipinos of Spanish descent are of Spaniard origin, while a very small minority are Latin American descents. Another term for them is Spanish Filipino. History before Hispanization Some of the societies scattered in the islands remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of Eastern and Southern Asia, including those from India, China, Japan and other Austronesian islands (The Malay archipelago). The 1st millennium saw the rise of the harbor principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous barangays independent of, or allied with larger nations which were either Malay thalassocracies, led by Datus or Indianized kingdoms governed by Rajahs. Language Philippine Spanish (Spanish: Espa√±ol Filipino, Castellano Filipino) is a variant of standard Spanish spoken in the Philippines. It is a Spanish dialect of the Spanish language. Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole, is spoken in the Zamboanga Peninsula (where it is an official dialect), Davao, and Cotabato in Mindanao, and Cavite in Luzon. Filipinos today speak a variety of different languages including Cebuano, Tagalog, Ilocano, Ilonggo, and Bikolano, in addition to English‚Äîall of which are 90% Austronesian languages, and also contain up several Spanish loanwords. The Philippines still completely attained its entire languages and culture despite years of colonial rule. The most common languages spoken in the Philippines today are English and Filipino, the national language that is a standardised form of Tagalog. Spanish was an official language of the country until immediately after the People Power Revolution in February 1986 and the subsequent ratification of the 1987 Constitution. The new charter dropped Spanish as an official language and today it is very rare to find a Spanish speaker, less than 0.1% of the population . However, the government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the fourteenth President of the Philippines and a hispanophone, reintroduced the study of Spanish into the state school system. Name of the Philippines The name of the Philippines comes from the king of Spain Philip II. It was given by the Spanish explorer Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos who named the islands of Samar and Leyte \\"Las Islas Felipinas\\" (The Philippine Islands), during his expedition in 1543. Throughout the colonial period, the name Felipinas (Philippines) was used, and became the official name of the Philippines. There are many provinces in the Philippines with Spanish names, such as Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva √âcija (Nueva Ecija), Laguna, Isabela, Quirino, Aurora, La Uni√≥n (La Union), Marinduque, Antique, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Nueva Segovia and Valle de Compostela. Many cities and towns are also named in Spanish, such as Medellin, La Libertad, Naga City (prior to 1919 was known as Nueva C√°ceres), Las Pi√±as, Prosperidad, Isabela, Sierra Bullones, Angeles, La Paz, Esperanza, Buenavista, Pilar, La Trinidad, Garcia Hernandez, Trece Martires, Los Ba√±os, and many more. There are numerous other towns and cities named after saints, such as San Fernando, Santa Rosa, San Isidro, San Jos√©, San Juan and San Pablo, as well as after Spanish places like Madrid, Santander, Toledo, C√°diz, Valencia, Murcia, Lucena, and Pamplona. Other native Filipino names are spelled using Spanish orthography, such as Cagay√°n de Oro, Para√±aque, and Ceb√∫. =Filipino Spanish surnames= A Spanish or Latin- sounding surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry in the Philippines. The names derive from the Spanish conquest of the Philippine Islands and its implementation of a Spanish naming system. After the Spanish conquest of the Philippine islands, many early Christianized Filipinos assumed religious-instrument or saint names. This resulted in many people surnamed \\"de los Santos\\" (\\"of the Saints\\"), \\"de la Cruz\\" (\\"of the Cross\\"), \\"del Rosario\\" (\\"of the Rosary\\"), \\"Bautista\\" (\\"Baptist\\"), etc. On November 21, 1849 the Spanish Governor General of the Philippine Islands, Narciso Claver√≠a, decreed the systematic distribution of surnames and the implementation of the Spanish naming system for the Filipinos. This produced the Cat√°logo alfab√©tico de apellidos (\\"Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames\\") listing Hispanicized Chinese and Filipino words, names, and numbers. Surnames of Spanish nobility and several colonial administrators, which include the preposition de as a nobiliary particle, were explicitly prohibited. Many names which resulted are not common to the Hispanophone world, because they were Hispanicized from the original Filipino or Chinese. This new naming system also did away with the Filipino custom of siblings taking different surnames. People Filipinos belong to the Austronesian ethnic group of the Southeast Asian region. The natives of the Philippine Islands may be related to the Chamorro people in the Mariana Islands (named Islas de Ladrones during Ferdinand Magellan's expedition) of the Pacific Ocean due to their racial similarity, and for being geographically not connected to the Southeast Asian mainland as a group of islands, but are rather different from the Pacific Islanders belonging to the Polynesian, Micronesian, and Melanesian ethnic groups. The natives of the Philippines are rather closely related to their closest neighbors, which are Malaysia and Indonesia. Most of the immigrant ethnicities of the Philippine Islands are from the Southeast Asian region. Although there are many ethnic groups in the Philippines, such as the native population (Tagalog, Bisaya, Bicolano, Ilocano, Mindanaoans, and the native Moros in Mindanao), that some people of the Philippines of this present time, consider them to be related to the Aborigines of Australia and Melanesians, are rather the result of the long period of interracial mixture among the native ethnic groups of the Islands. The Philippine Islands is still politically divided among the ethnic groups and regional groups, but there are also Chinese, Japanese, and Indian peoples who migrated after the Spanish colonial era and created their own non-native ethnic group. There are still a few Filipinos and prominent Filipino families today who are of pure Spanish ancestry. Nevertheless, Stanford University had stated that only 1‚Äì3% of the Philippine population had minimal degrees of Spanish blood. The official percentage of Filipinos with Spanish ancestry is unknown. However, in a research done by Dr. Michael Purugganan, NYU Dean of Science in 2013, he conclude that Filipinos today are the conclusion of an Austronesian and Chinese migration result from thousands of years, a melting pot of Asia in pre-colonial era. He stated that; \\"We are all of many Indo- China mixes, and I think every Filipino who is genetically tested will show up as a mix. We are products of what we evolutionary genomicists call genetic admixture, the result of several thousand years of mixing in our island archipelago at the edge of the Pacific. We were always getting genes from everyone who came to our shores. We are, in a genetic sense, a truly global people.\\" Religion The statue of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia in procession to the high altar of Manila Cathedral. The Philippines is one of two predominantly Christian countries in Asia, the other being East Timor. About 86% of the population is Catholic, 11% are Muslim, and about 3% practice other religions or are irreligious. Filipinos at home set up altars in the Hispanic tradition, adorned with Catholic images, flowers, and candles. During fiestas, most communities organise church services and religious processions in honour of a patron saint, hold funfairs and concerts, and feast with a variety of Filipino foods. =Festivities= All major Christian holidays are observed as official national holidays in the Philippines. Spanish culture and Christianity has influenced the customs and traditions of the Philippines. Every year on the 3rd Sunday of January, the Philippines celebrates the festival of the \\"Santo Ni√±o\\" (Holy Child Jesus), the largest being held in Cebu City. =Holidays= *January 1 ‚Äì New Year's Day (Bagong Taon) *March or April ‚Äì Semana Santa (Holy Week or Easter) *October 31 to November 2 ‚Äì Day of the Dead, Araw ng mga Kaluluwa (All Souls' Day), and Todos Los Santos (All Saints' Day) where families spend much of the 3 days and 3 evenings visiting their ancestral graves, showing respect and honoring the departed relatives by feasting, decorating and offering prayers. *December 24 ‚Äì Nochebuena (The Good night or Christmas Eve) *December 25 ‚Äì Christmas (Pasko) *dec 26 - tae Arts, literature and music Hispanic influence is based on Indigenous, and European tradition. Folk dance, music, and literature have remained intact in the 21st century. These were introduced from Spain in the 16th century, and can be regarded as largely Hispanic in constitution, which have remained in the Philippines for centuries.

In the business community, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) plays an integral role in the economic, political and social development of the nation. Historically, the chamber can be traced back as early as the 1890s with the inauguration of the C√°mara de Comercio de Filipinas. This organisation was composed mainly of Spanish companies such as the Compa√±ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas, F√°brica de Cerveza San Miguel, and Elizalde y C√≠a, among other Spanish, and Philippine companies. During the first half of the 20th century commerce, and industrial trades with other Hispanic countries declined due to the United States administration of the Philippines and the Second World War. However, the resurgence of trade between Spain and Latin American nations had risen toward the closing of the century. 1998 marked the centennial celebration of Philippine independence, and opened a new opportunity for both Hispanic and Filipino businesses to reconnect their historic ties as trade partners.

Their absences were not noted by the boat crew until two days later on January 27 and while search efforts resulted in the discovery of personal effects presumed to be those of the Lonergans, they did not lead to their discovery. Their whereabouts are unknown, though both are presumed dead. The couple's disappearance and deaths resulted in \\"a crisis of confidence in north Queensland's dive industry\\" and resulted in tighter mandatory safety regulations for diving boats in Australia.

Retrieved May 14, 2019. Disappearance On January 25, 1998, the Lonergans were scuba diving with a group at St. Crispin's Reef in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The boat transporting the group to the dive site departed before the Lonergans returned from the water. None of the vessel's crew or passengers noticed the two had not come back aboard. At the time of the incident, the couple had recently completed a two-year tour of duty with the Peace Corps at Funafuti atoll in the small South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu and were repeating that work in Fiji. Aftermath The pair was not discovered missing until two days later, on January 27, 1998, after a bag containing their belongings was found on board the dive boat. A massive air and sea search took place over the following three days. In February 1998, a women's wetsuit matching Eileen's size washed ashore in north Queensland. Upon examination of barnacle growth on the wetsuit, it was determined it had likely been submerged in the ocean since January. It also bore tears along buttock and armpit area, presumed by examiners to have resulted from coming in contact with coral. Six months after the disappearance, in June 1998, more of the couple's diving gear was found washed up on a Port Douglas beach approximately from where they were lost. Among these items were inflatable dive jackets marked with the Lonergans' names, along with their compressed air tanks and one of Eileen's fins. Also recovered was a weathered diver's slate (a device used for communicating underwater) which reportedly read: \\"Monday Jan 26; 1998 08am. To anyone who can help us: We have been abandoned on A[gin]court Reef by MV Outer Edge 25 Jan 1998 3pm. Please help to rescue us before we die. Help!!!\\" =Suspicions= Several theories were suggested surrounding their disappearance. At the time, it was suggested that the Lonergans might have staged their disappearance. However, the Lonergans' bank accounts were never touched and their insurance policies were not claimed. Another theory suggested that the pair committed suicide, or murder‚Äìsuicide. This theory was bolstered by entries found in both victims' diaries. Excerpts from Tom's personal diary were used to portray a deeply disturbed man who was looking for a \\"quick and peaceful\\" death. Eileen's writings had expressed concern for her well-being, given Tom's \\"death wish\\". She had openly chosen to stay with Tom, no matter the outcome.Foggo, Daniel. ‚ÄúA mystery resurfaces‚Äù. The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) - (c/o the Age). August 7, 2004 However, the diary entries were taken out of context, according to Eileen's parents and family members.Chipperfield, Mark. \\"Coral reef couple 'faked dive deaths'\\". The London Daily Telegraph. Sunday 26 April 1998 The family, the coroner Noel Nunan, and the Port Douglas police claim that only pages that would validate the suicide theory were leaked to the press, whereas the majority of the diaries remain unread except by the coroner, Port Douglas police, and the Hains family. Eileen's father, John Hains, later said that he suspects the couple ultimately became dehydrated and disoriented and in the end succumbed to drowning or sharks. During the inquest on the deaths, experts speculated that, based on the state of the gear recovered, the couple had not likely experienced an animal attack, but rather succumbed to delirium resulting from dehydration, which caused them to voluntarily remove their diving outfits. Without the buoyancy provided by their gear, experts testified the couple would have been unable to tread water for long, and would have soon drowned. The coroner dismissed suggestions that the Lonergans had either committed suicide or faked their own disappearance, and formally charged Geoffrey Ian \\"Jack\\" Nairn, skipper of the dive boat, with their unlawful killing.\\"Missing divers 'unlawfully killed' \\". news.bbc.co.uk He was later found not guilty,\\"Death of Two American Divers - Thomas and Eileen Lonergan\\". michaelmcfadyensscuba.info but his company, Outer Edge Dive, was fined after pleading guilty to negligence and went out of business. Queensland's government also introduced stiffer regulations, among which was the requirement that captains and dive masters independently confirm each head count. =Media= The 2003 movie Open Water claims to be based on the Lonergans' disappearance. In the film, all names are changed, but there is a strong resemblance to the Lonergans' story. The documentary Crime Stories: Deep Secret also featured the story of the Lonergans. Their disappearances were referenced in a game titled Stranded Deep, in which a diver's slate can be found with an exact copy of the message that was on the real slate recovered during the Search and Rescue mission. Their disappearance is detailed in the podcast, Casefile True Crime Podcast in the episode Case 133: Tom & Eileen Lonergan.

The Council of State consisted of the President of the Republic of Poland as chairman, the Marshal and Vice-marshals of the Sejm, President of the Supreme Audit Office, and potential other members. The Council of State had the power to approve decrees issued by the Council of Ministers, exercise supreme control over the local national councils, approve promulgation of laws concerning the budget and military draft, declare a state of emergency and martial law, initiate legislation, and others.Small Constitution at the Sejm website Under the 1952 Constitution of the Polish People's Republic, the office of the President of Poland was eliminated the Council of State became a collective head of state organ. According to Article 29 of the constitution, the Council of State consisted of seventeen people: the chairman, four deputy chairmen, the secretary, and eleven other members. All were elected by the Sejm from its members during the parliament's first session after elections. They were usually chosen from the deputies representing the Polish United Workers' Party, although occasionally other deputies were elected. In practice, the council (and the Polish state) was often represented by its chairman, who may have been referred to as the president of Poland by foreign representatives. The council ratified or renounced international agreements, appointed and recalled representatives of Poland to other states and to international organizations; it conferred orders and had the power of pardon. Some of its other constitutional functions were: * calling elections to the Sejm and convening its sessions, * issuing decrees during periods between Sejm sessions (the decrees had to be later accepted by the Sejm), * initiating legislation, * determining binding interpretations of Sejm statues. When the Sejm was not in session (in practice, for most of the year), the Council of State had the power to issue decrees that had the force of law. These decrees had to be approved by the Sejm at its next session.Chapter 3 of 1952 Constitution Due to the principles of democratic centralism, however, such approvals were usually a mere formality. The Council of State institution was eliminated on 19 July 1989 by a constitutional amendment. Some of its functions were transferred to the reestablished office of the President of Poland.

Provincial politics He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1978 as a Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). He was elected leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party in 1982, but resigned within a year of his rising to that post due to a poor showing in the 1982 provincial election. When the Liberals formed a government under Frank McKenna in 1987, Young served as Minister of Fisheries. Federal politics Young left provincial politics to run in the 1988 federal election for the Liberal Party of Canada, and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP). With the election of a Liberal government in the 1993 election, the new Prime Minister, Jean Chr√©tien, appointed Young to the Canadian cabinet as Minister of Transport. In that position, Young eliminated the Crow Rate which regulated the cost western farmers had to pay to transport their goods via rail, and privatized the Canadian National Railway. In January 1996, he became Minister of Employment and Immigration (subsequently retitled Minister of Human Resources Development) and Minister of Labour. In October 1996, he was appointed Minister of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs. As Defence Minister, Young generated much criticism when, in 1997, he suspended the formal inquiry into the Somalia Affair in which Canadian troops had been accused of mistreating prisoners in Somalia in 1993. Young was an outspoken and even bombastic politician, once calling Reform Party MP Deborah Grey \\"a slab of bacon\\" in the House. (The Hansard record of 3 April 1989 records that Young, along with the N.D.P. MP for Edmonton East, Ross Harvey, escorted Grey into the House that day.) In one of the chief upsets of the 1997 election, Young was defeated in his riding by Yvon Godin of the New Democratic Party. The Liberal government's changes to Unemployment Insurance were a key factor in his defeat because of the large number of seasonal workers in Young's riding. This was also a factor in the defeat of Young's Cabinet colleague and fellow Maritimer David Dingwall. Since his defeat, Young has worked in Ottawa as a lobbyist. Despite his Liberal affiliations, Young supported the candidacy of Tom Long to lead the right-wing Canadian Alliance in that party's leadership election in 2000. He supported St√©phane Dion for the leadership of the Liberal Party.

Canada Section 239 of the Criminal Code makes attempted murder punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. If a gun is used, the minimum sentence is four, five or seven years, dependent on prior convictions and relation to organized crime.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 239. United Kingdom =England and Wales= In English criminal law, attempted murder is the crime of simultaneously preparing to commit an unlawful killing and having a specific intention to cause the death of a human being under the Queen's Peace. The phrase \\"more than merely preparatory\\" is specified by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 to denote the fact that preparation for a crime by itself does not constitute an \\"attempted crime\\". In England and Wales, as an \\"attempt\\", attempted murder is an offence under section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and is an indictable offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (the same as the mandatory sentence for murder). The corresponding legislation for Northern Ireland is section 3(1) of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (No.1120 (N.I.13)). The mens rea (Latin for the \\"guilty mind\\") for murder includes an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm where there is virtual certainty of death resulting, whereas attempted murder depends on an intention to kill and an overt act towards committing homicide. Attempted murder is only the planning of a murder and acts taken towards it, not the actual killing, which is the murder. This makes the offence very difficult to prove and it is more common for a lesser charge to be preferred under the Offences against the Person Act 1861. However, in R v Morrison [2003] 1 WLR 1859, the Court of Appeal considered the issue of alternative verdicts on an indictment with a single count of attempted murder. Morrison had gone into a shop with two other men on a robbery with a firearm. They demanded money and one of the men shot at the shopkeeper who suffered only minor injury. The prosecution had many opportunities to add other counts before the trial but failed to act. Having heard the case, the judge expressed his view that the jury could consider an attempted grievous bodily harm (GBH) under section 18 of the 1861 Act and Morrison was duly convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. The Court of Appeal confirmed that attempting to cause grievous bodily harm is a valid alternative to attempted murder because there can be no intention to kill someone without the intention also to cause grievous bodily harm. This is a practical decision to ensure that the criminal justice system did not allow a guilty person to walk away because only one charge had been preferred. But it is not necessarily a good general principle because, in euthanasia for example, a person assisting intends to cause death, but with no suffering. That attempting to cause grievous bodily harm must be an alternative verdict should the intended victim not die would be a strange outcome because there is no intention to cause any long-lasting and serious injury: the two attempted offences have different mens rea requirements so that proof of intent to murder would not necessarily meet the requirement for section 18 of the 1861 Act. First, acting deliberately and intentionally or recklessly with extreme disregard for human life, the person attempted to kill someone; and the person did something that was a substantial step toward committing the crime. [Mere preparation is not a substantial step toward committing a crime.] Proof of mens rea There must be more than merely preparatory acts and, although the defendant may threaten death, this may not provide convincing evidence of an intention to kill unless the words are accompanied by relevant action, e.g. finding and picking up a weapon and making serious use of it, or making a serious and sustained physical attack without a weapon. Duress, necessity and marital coercion The defences of duress and necessity are not available to a person charged with attempted murder. Conversely, the statutory defence of marital coercion is, on the face of the statute, available to a wife charged with attempted murder.The Criminal Justice Act 1925 (15 & 16 Geo.5 c.86), section 47The Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 (c.15)(N.I.), section 37 History Prior to 1967, sections 11 to 15 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 created a number of offences of attempting to commit murder by various specified means (ss.11 to 14), and an offence of attempting to commit murder by any means not specified in those offences (s.15). After the repeal of these offences by the Criminal Law Act 1967, attempted murder was allowed to subsist at common law until the enactment of the 1981 Act. =Scotland= Attempted murder is a crime at common law in Scotland. Attempted murder is the same as the offence of murder in Scottish law with the only difference being that the victim has not died.Cawthorne v HMA, 1968 JC 32, 36 per LJ-G Clyde. The offence of murder was defined in Drury v HM Advocate: Intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case. Wicked recklessness is determined objectivelyBroadley v HMA, 1991 JC 108, 114 per LJ-C Ross. and is \\"recklessness so gross that it indicates a state of mind which falls to be treated as wicked and depraved as the state of mind of a deliberate killer.\\" Scott v HMA, 1996 JC 1, 5 (opinion of the court) As with all common law offences in Scotland, the maximum punishment available is life imprisonment. United States In the United States, attempted murder is an inchoate crime to the US. A conviction for attempted murder requires a demonstration of an intent to murder, meaning that the perpetrator either tried to murder and failed (e.g. attempted to shoot the victim and missed or shot the victim and the victim survived) or took a substantial step towards committing a murder (e.g. purchasing a gun or other deadly weapon and writing about his or her intent to kill).

It serves the national community through the publication of academic journals, community bulletins, and the administration of mathematical competitions. It was originally conceived in June 1945 as the Canadian Mathematical Congress. A name change was debated for many years; ultimately, a new name was adopted in 1979, upon its incorporation as a non-profit charitable organization. The society is also affiliated with various national and international mathematical societies, including the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The society is also a member of the International Mathematical Union and the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. History The Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS) was originally conceived in June 1945 as the Canadian Mathematical Congress. The founding members hoped that \\"this congress [would] be the beginning of important mathematical development in Canada\\". Seeking to end confusion with the quadrennial mathematical congresses, a name change was considered for many years. Finally, upon its incorporation as a non-profit, charitable organization in 1978, a new name was adopted - the Canadian Mathematical Society. Since then the Society has expanded its activities to serve K-12 and post secondary students as well as professors and established researchers. Graham Wright served as Executive Director of the CMS from 1979 to 2009, and helped to build up the Society's Executive Office in Ottawa and to develop its web-based electronic services. The Canadian Mathematical Society was to celebrate its 75th anniversary during its 2020 Summer Meeting in Ottawa, ON. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting was postponed to 2021 Summer Meeting. Publications The flagship publications of the CMS are the prominent, peer-reviewed research journals Canadian Journal of Mathematics, which is intended for full research papers, and the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, which publishes shorter papers. All past issues except the last five volumes are free to download. Access to the most recent research requires a subscription. In cooperation with Springer Publications, the CMS publishes many text books aimed at a university and academic researcher level. The series is called CMS Books in Mathematics. The CMS publishes ten issues per year of Crux Mathematicorum, which contains problem-solving challenges and techniques suitable for training in secondary school problem solving competitions such as the Canadian Mathematical Olympiad or the International Mathematical Olympiad. All past issues except the last five volumes are free to download and use. The CMS also publishes A Taste of Mathematics (ATOM), a series of small booklets on a variety of topics suitable for high school enrichment. The CMS Notes is the Society's official newsletter, published six times per year and available to members or the public online. It includes news relevant to the Canadian mathematical community, including notice on conferences, columns on research and education, book reviews, award announcements, and employment advertisements for mathematicians. Activities =Student Committee= The Canadian Mathematical Society's Student Committee (Studc) was formed in 1999. Studc aims to bring together French and English Canadian graduate and undergraduate mathematics students through research and networking events and publication opportunities. Studc manages and publishes Notes from the Margin, a magazine-style publication devoted to publishing accessible research-based content in addition to opinion pieces, news articles, open problems that are of interest to the mathematical community, and brainteaser puzzles. =Conferences= CMS Meetings CMS organizes two bilingual Meetings each year: the CMS Winter Meeting is normally held during the first weekend of December and the CMS Summer Meeting during the first weekend of June. Each Meeting takes place over the course of 3 days, with 2 days of pre-meeting activities. This includes the executive meeting, board of directors meeting, group development luncheon and mini-courses. CMS Meetings are among the biggest mathematical events in Canada, bringing together over 800 of the most respected researchers, educators, post- doctorates and students in mathematics and related fields from around the world. The includes many scientific sessions and plenary, prize and public lectures. Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference Through its Student Committee, the CMS is the main sponsor for the bilingual Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference, an annual research and networking conference held each summer and targeted at Canadian undergraduates interested in any area of pure or applied mathematics. It is entirely student-run and driven by Studc. Delegates may opt to present a poster or paper, as well as a short talk on a topic of their choosing. The location of the conference is alternated between central Canada (defined as Ontario and Quebec) and Western or Eastern Canada every other year, with host applications being submitted by hopefuls a year in advance. CWiMAC The Women in Mathematics committee of the CMS also runs Connecting Women in Mathematics Across Canada (CWiMAC), a workshop and conference aimed at upcoming Canadian female mathematicians. In particular, they target current PhD students and new postdoctoral fellows seeking guidance in their field. The conference strives to strengthen the community between young female mathematicians and their senior counterparts through the building of mentorship, relationships, and networking. =Competitions= The CMS administers the Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge, a problem solving competition targeted at Canadian high school students, which is modelled after the analogous William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition for undergraduates. High-scoring students may be invited to compete in the Canadian Mathematical Olympiad, a problem-solving and mathematics competition run by the CMS which is also used as a screening process for the selection of the Canadian team for the International Mathematical Olympiad. =Outreach= CMS runs several annual summer math camps across Canada to foster interest and excitement in elementary-school and secondary-school aged students. Some CMS math camps, are based on invitation and are targeted at high-potential students from all backgrounds, and others are open to all students with interest in mathematics. The CMS also runs several smaller specialty camps targeted at visible minorities and under- represented groups in the mathematical community. Many member organizations also run outreach events to attract local talent to mathematics, such as Math Challenge programs held at the local university, Math Enrichment Centres, and educational events throughout the academic year. Awards The CMS annually awards the following prizes: *Jeffery‚ÄìWilliams Prize to recognize mathematicians who have made outstanding contributions to mathematical research. *Adrien Pouliot Award for contributions to mathematical education in Canada. *David Borwein Distinguished Career Award to recognize individuals who have made exceptional, broad, and continued contributions to Canadian mathematics. *Graham Wright Award for Distinguished Service recognizes individuals who have made sustained and significant contributions to the Canadian mathematical community and, in particular, to the Canadian Mathematical Society. *Excellence in Teaching Award recognizes sustained and distinguished contributions in teaching at the post-secondary undergraduate level. *G. de B.

Design and development Douglas proposed a number of modifications designed to improve the performance of the B-18. Initially considered a redesign, the XB-22 featured 1,600 hp Wright R-2600-1 Twin Cyclone radial engines. The complete B-18 redesign was considered promising enough by the USAAC to alter the original contract to produce the last 38 B-18As ordered under Contract AC9977 as the B-23. The design incorporated a larger wingspan with a wing design very similar to that of the DC-3, a fully retractable undercarriage, and improved defensive armament. The B-23 was the first operational American bomber equipped with a glazed tail gun position.Mondey 1982, p. 111. The tail gun was a .50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine gun, which was fired from the prone position by a gunner using a telescopic sight.\\"Stinger Gun in Plane's Tail Guards Vulnerable Spot.\\" Popular Science, January 1941. The first B-23 flew on July 27, 1939 with the production series of 38 B-23s manufactured between July 1939 and September 1940. Operational history While significantly faster and better armed than the B-18, the B-23 was not comparable to newer medium bombers like the North American B-25 Mitchell and Martin B-26 Marauder. For this reason, the 38 B-23s built were never used in combat overseas, although for a brief period they were employed as patrol aircraft stationed on the west coast of the United States. The B-23s were primarily relegated to training duties, although 18 of them were later converted as transports and redesignated UC-67. The B-23 also served as a testbed for new engines and systems. For example, one was used for turbosupercharger development by General Electric at Schenectady, New York. After World War II, many examples were used as executive transports, with appropriate internal modifications, and as a result a large number have survived. With its wartime experience with the type, GE bought and used five of them. Howard Hughes (among others) used converted B-23s as personal aircraft.

The Anti-Renters declared their independence from the manor system run by patroons, resisting tax collectors and successfully demanding land reform. Events The incident began with the death of Stephen Van Rensselaer III in 1839. Van Rensselaer, who was described as having \\"...proved a lenient and benevolent landowner\\" was the patroon of the region at the time, and was a descendant of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, the first patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. During his life, he preferred to allow rents to accumulate or to accept partial payment when tenants were in financial constraints. However, his leases also included a \\"quarter-sale\\" provision, which required tenants who sold their leases to pay Van Rensselaer one fourth of the sale price or one additional year's rent. The patroons owned all the land on which the tenants in the Hudson Valley lived, and used this feudal lease system to maintain control of the region. When he died, Van Rensselaer's will directed his heirs to collect outstanding rents and \\"quarter sale\\" payments to apply to the estate debts. When the heirs attempted to collect, tenants could not pay the amounts demanded, could not secure a favorable payment schedule from the heirs, and could not obtain relief in the courts, so they revolted. The first mass meeting of tenant farmers leading to the Anti-Rent War was held at the top of the Helderberg mountains in Berne, New York on July 4, 1839. They issued a declaration of independence, promising: \\"We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses.\\"Miller (1967), pp. 66‚Äì69. In December 1839 the Anti-Renters repulsed a 500-man posse led by Albany County sheriff Michael Artcher and including William Marcy and John Van Buren. Governor William Seward threatened the rebels with 700 militiamen and obtained their surrender. However, an insurrection continued to smolder. Disguised \\"Calico Indians\\" resisted tax collection and law enforcement, sometimes tarring and feathering their enemies.Thomas Summerhill, \\"Anti-Rent Wars (New York)\\", in Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-class History Vol. 1, ed. Eric Arnesen; Routledge, 2007; ; pp. 118‚Äì119. In January 1845, one hundred and fifty delegates from eleven counties assembled at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Berne to call for political action to redress their grievances. Results The Anti-Rent War led to the creation of the Antirenter Party, which had a strong influence on New York State politics from 1846‚Äì51.Michael Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War, NY: Oxford U Press, 1999, 240-42, 299,591-91,647,655-56. Newly elected governor Silas Wright moved in 1845 to stamp out the Calico Indians, and pushed for a law which outlawed disguises. Trials of leaders of the revolt, charged with riot, conspiracy and robbery, were held in 1845 with Amasa J. Parker presiding. Attorneys included Ambrose L. Jordan, as leading counsel for the defense, and John Van Buren, the state attorney general, who personally conducted the prosecution. At the first trial, the jury came to no conclusion and Parker declared a mistrial. During a re-trial in September 1845, the two attorneys started a fistfight in open court. Both were sentenced by the presiding judge, John W. Edmonds, to \\"solitary confinement in the county jail for 24 hours.\\" At the conclusion of the trial, one defendant, Smith A. Boughton, was sentenced to life imprisonment. After the election of John Young as governor with the support of the Anti-Renters, he pardoned Boughton. John Van Steenburgh and Edward O'Connor were sentenced to death by hanging for their involvement in the shooting of Undersheriff Osman Steele, an incident which took place at Moses Earle's farm in Andes, New York during a sheriff's sale after Earle was unable to pay his rent. Earle and two others were sentenced to life in prison. Several others received lesser prison sentences. Governor Young later commuted the death sentences to life in prison.

Production The film was produced by D.A. Pennebaker, and directed by Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim. Noujaim had been Kaleil Tuzman's Harvard classmate and began filming Tuzman as he quit his job at Goldman Sachs, to begin govWorks with his high school friend Tom Herman. Noujaim contacted Hegedus and Pennebaker for help in financing the project. The film was distributed by Artisan Entertainment (which was later acquired by Lions Gate Entertainment). The film was shot in digital video. The filmmakers shot for over two years, and were editing the more than 400 hours of video and film right up to their Sundance Film Festival premiere in early 2001. They re-edited the last few minutes of the film just prior to its May 2001 theatrical release. Since the film's release, Herman and Tuzman have worked together again at Recognition Group and JumpTV.

Its main purpose is to take the load off the turbocharger when the throttle is suddenly closed.  Characteristics  A typical piston-type dump valve, used in auto racing. Unlike a blowoff valve, this one does not vent to the atmosphere. The small hose at the top is a feed from the intake manifold. A compressor bypass valve (CBV), also known as a pressure relief valve or diverter valve, is a manifold vacuum-actuated valve designed to release pressure in the intake system of a turbocharged vehicle when the throttle is lifted or closed. This air pressure is re-circulated back into the non-pressurized end of the intake (before the turbo) but after the mass airflow sensor. A blowoff valve, (sometimes \\"hooter valve\\" or BOV) performs the same task but releases the air into the atmosphere instead of recirculating it. This type of valve is typically an aftermarket modification. The blowoff action produces a range of distinctive hissing sounds, depending on the exit design. Some blowoff valves are sold with a trumpet-shaped exit that intentionally amplifies the sound. Some turbocharged vehicle owners may purchase a blowoff valve solely for the auditory effect even when the function is not required by normal engine operation. Motor sports governed by the FIA have made it illegal to vent unmuffled blowoff valves to the atmosphere. Blowoff valves are used to prevent compressor surge, a phenomenon that readily occurs when lifting off the throttle of an unvented, turbocharged engine. The sound produced is called turbo flutter (the slang term \\"choo-choo\\" is sometimes used). When the throttle plate on a turbocharged engine closes, with the turbine spinning at high speed, the flow reduces beyond the surge line of the compressor. At this point the change in pressure across the compressor reduces, leading to a collapse in flow and possibly even flow reversal and a collapse in plenum pressure. As the compressor is still spinning at high speed, once the flow has reduced sufficiently, the change in across the compressor begins to rise and flow is re-established into the plenum. This continues until once again the plenum is pressurised and flow begins to fall until the surge line is again crossed and the cycle repeats. This unstable flow leads to the cyclic noise sometimes heard on high boost engines with no bypass valve. With a valve fitted, flow is maintained preventing the compressor entering the stall/surge cycle. The repeated, high speed cycling will cause a cyclic torque on the compressor and may lead to increased stresses on the bearings and compressor impeller.  Operation  When the throttle plate is open, the air pressure on both sides of the piston in the blow-off valve is equal and the spring keeps the piston down. When the throttle is closed, a vacuum forms in the manifold. This in combination with the pressurized air from the turbocharger moves the piston in the valve up, releasing the pressure into the inlet of the turbo (Recirc.) or the atmosphere (BOV). A blowoff valve is connected by a vacuum hose to the intake manifold after the throttle plate. When the throttle is closed, the relative manifold pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the resulting pressure differential operates the blowoff valve's piston. The excess pressure from the turbocharger is then vented into the atmosphere or recirculated into the intake upstream of the compressor inlet.  Disadvantages  In the case where a mass airflow sensor (MAF) is used and is located upstream from the blowoff valve, the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements. The engine then briefly operates with a fuel-rich mixture after each valve actuation. The rich mixing can lead to hesitation or even stalling of the engine when the throttle is closed, a situation that worsens with higher boost pressures. Occasional events of this type may be only a nuisance, but frequent events can eventually foul the spark plugs and destroy the catalytic converter, as the inefficiently combusted fuel produces soot (excess carbon) and unburned fuel in the exhaust flow can produce soot in the converter and drive the converter beyond its normal operating temperature range. An alternative method for utilizing both a MAF and a blowoff valve is to have the MAF located down stream between the intercooler and the throttle plate. This is known as Blow-through rather than the traditional Draw-through set up. Care must be taken as to the position of the MAF to prevent damage to the sensitive element. For example, on a SR20DET engine, the MAF must be at least from the throttle plate, and the blowoff valve must be from the MAF sensor. By using a blow-through method, the MAF won't be affected by the blowoff valve opening as the pressure is vented before the air reaches the MAF. One approach used to mitigate the problem has been to reduce the boost pressure, which reduces the required venting volume and yields less charge over-calculation by the ECU. The air can also be recirculated back into the intake, a typical stock setup for cars with an upstream MAF sensor. The situation can also be corrected by switching the fuel metering system over to a manifold absolute pressure sensor, a conversion that usually requires a compatible aftermarket ECU or piggy-back fuel controller. The MAP sensor monitors the absolute pressure in the manifold at all times and will correctly detect the change that occurs when the valve vents, allowing the ECU to reduce fuel metering accordingly.

He spent most of his career working to end employment discrimination in the United States and turning the National Urban League from a relatively passive civil rights organization into one that aggressively worked for equitable access to socioeconomic opportunity for the historically disenfranchised. Early life and career Young was born in Shelby County, Kentucky, on July 31, 1921. His father, Whitney M. Young, Sr., was the president of the Lincoln Institute, and served twice as the president of the Kentucky Negro Educational Association. Whitney's mother, Laura (Ray) Young, was a teacher who served as the first female postmistress in Kentucky (second in the United States), being appointed to that position by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. Young enrolled in the Lincoln Institute at the age of 13, graduating as his class valedictorian, with his sister Margaret becoming salutatorian, in 1937. Young earned his Bachelor of Science in social work from Kentucky State University, a historically black institution. Young had aspirations of becoming a doctor at Kentucky State. During this time at Kentucky State, Young was also a forward on the university's basketball team, and was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, where he served as the vice president. He became the president of his senior class, and graduated in 1941. During World War II, Young was trained in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was then assigned to a road construction crew of black soldiers supervised by Southern white officers. After just three weeks, he was promoted from private to first sergeant, creating hostility on both sides. Despite the tension, Young was able to mediate effectively between his white officers and black soldiers angry at their poor treatment. This situation propelled Young into a career in race relations. After the war, Young joined his wife, Margaret, at the University of Minnesota, where he earned a master's degree in social work in 1947 and volunteered for the St. Paul branch of the National Urban League. He was then appointed as the industrial relations secretary in that branch in 1949. In 1950, Young became president of the National Urban League's Omaha, Nebraska chapter. In that position, he helped get black workers into jobs previously reserved for whites. Under his leadership, the chapter tripled its number of paying members. While he was president of the Omaha Urban League, Young taught at the University of Nebraska from 1950 to 1954, and Creighton University from 1951 to 1952. In 1954, he took up his next position, as the first dean of social work at Atlanta University.W. Peebles-Wilkins, 1995, \\"Young, Whitney Moore Jr.,\\" Encyclopedia of Social Work (19th ed., Vol. 3, R.L. Edwards, Ed.), Washington, DC: NASW Press, pp. 2618-2619, see , accessed February 15, 2015.Office of the Dean, 2015, \\"Brief History of the Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work,\\" Atlanta, GA:Clark Atlanta University (Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work), see [www.cau.edu/school-of-social- work/_files/msw_catalog.pdf], accessed February 15, 2015. There, Young supported alumni in their boycott of the Georgia Conference of Social Welfare in response to low rates of African-American employment within the organization. In December, 1954, Young and his wife Margaret were the first blacks to join the United Liberal Church (since 1965, named the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta), and Whitney would eventually join its Board of Trustees. Due in part to the Youngs' influence, the church stopped having its annual picnics at segregated parks and became \\"integrated not just desegregated.\\" Many in the congregation were active in the civil rights movement, and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., then assistant to his father at nearby Ebenezer Baptist Church, was a pulpit guest. In 1957 he co- authored Some Pioneers in Social Work: brief sketches; student work book with Florence V. Adams. In 1960, Young was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation grant for a postgraduate year at Harvard University. In the same year, he joined the NAACP and rose to become state president, where he was also a close friend of Roy Wilkins, its executive director. Executive Director of National Urban League In 1961, at age 40, Young became Executive Director of the National Urban League. He was unanimously selected by the National Urban League's Board of Directors, succeeding Lester Granger on October 1, 1961. Within four years he expanded the organization from 38 employees to 1,600 employees; and from an annual budget of $325,000 to one of $6,100,000. Young served as President of the Urban League until his death in 1971. The Urban League had traditionally been a cautious and moderate organization with many white members. During Young's ten-year tenure at the League, he brought the organization to the forefront of the American Civil Rights Movement. He both greatly expanded its mission and kept the support of influential white business and political leaders. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro? and archived at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History, Young expressed the mission of the Urban League not as ground-level activism in itself but as the supplement and complement of the activities of all other organizations; he states, \\"we are the social engineers, we are the strategists, we are the planners, we are the people who work at the level of policy-making, policy implementation, the highest echelons of the corporate community, the highest echelons of the governmental community ‚Äì both at the federal, state and local level ‚Äì the highest echelons of the labor movement.\\" As part of the League's new mission, Young initiated programs like \\"Street Academy\\", an alternative education system to prepare high school dropouts for college, and \\"New Thrust\\", an effort to help local black leaders identify and solve community problems. Young also pushed for federal aid to cities, proposing a domestic \\"Marshall Plan\\". This plan, which called for $145 billion in spending over 10 years, was partially incorporated into President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty. Young described his proposals for integration, social programs, and affirmative action in his two books, To Be Equal (1964) and Beyond Racism (1969). As executive director of the League, Young pushed major corporations to hire more blacks. In doing so, he fostered close relationships with CEOs such as Henry Ford II, leading some blacks to charge that Young had sold out to the white establishment. Young denied these charges and stressed the importance of working within the system to effect change. Still, Young was not afraid to take a bold stand in favor of civil rights. For instance, in 1963, Young was one of the organizers of the March on Washington despite the opposition of many white business leaders. The Treatment\\" from President Johnson (1966) Despite his reluctance to enter politics himself, Young was an important advisor to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. In 1968, representatives of President-elect Richard Nixon tried to interest Young in a Cabinet post, but Young refused, believing that he could accomplish more through the Urban League.Nancy J. Weiss, Whitney M. Young Jr. and the Struggle for Civil Rights, Princeton University Press, 1990, p. 192. Young had a particularly close relationship with President Johnson, and in 1969, Johnson honored Young with the highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Young, in turn, was impressed by Johnson's commitment to civil rights. Despite their close personal relationship, Young was frustrated by Johnson's attempts to use him to balance Martin Luther King's opposition to the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War.Weiss (1990), p. 163. Young publicly supported Johnson's war policy, but came to oppose the war after the end of Johnson's presidency. In February 1968 President Lyndon Johnson and Mayor of Chicago Richard Daley discussed the possibility of Young replacing fellow African American Robert Weaver in the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In 1968, as part of an FBI organized COINTEL operation against the Black liberation movement, Herman B. Ferguson and Arthur Harris were convicted of conspiring to murder Young. The police infiltrators who concocted this frame-up portrayed it as a \\"Black revolutionary plot.\\" The trial took place in the New York State Supreme Court, with Justice Paul Balsam presiding.See \\"Paul Balsam Dead; A Justice In Queens,\\" The New York Times, December 24, 1972, available for purchase at  Contribution to the American Institute of Architects  In 1968, Young was invited to address the American Institute of Architects National Convention in Portland, Oregon through the keynote speech. At the time, Young was the executive director of the National Urban League and had spoken before on the concerns of the AIA regarding social and racial inequality in housing and cities. In his speech, he addressed the Institute's silent stance on the turmoil in the country and urged them to stand up and endorse the efforts of John F. Kennedy & Martin Luther King Jr. in their actions. http://content.aia.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/WhitneyYoungJr_1968AIAContention_FulLSpeech.pdf In response to Young's words, the Institute created two separate resolutions to advance the organizations initiative for diversity and social equality: one created a scholarship program, the AIA/Architects Foundation Diversity Advancement Scholarship, specifically for minorities who wanted to study architecture and another called architects to be actively engaged in the current social issues. To address the lack of diversity in the profession, the AIA revised their Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to ban discrimination based on sex, race or religion and was expanded in subsequent years to include place of origin, disabled status and sexual orientation or gender identity. The Institute also created a Whitney M. Young Jr. Award for those that embodies the social principles of equity and justice that Young fought for. Along with that, \\"community design\\" emerged as an initiative for architects to engage with people in urban projects, instead of working exclusively alone. Young's speech served as a driver for those that were previously frustrated with architecture and urban design. The AIA then started the Regional/Urban Design Assistance Team Program and Center for Communities by Design as programs that work for community development and include community members in the design process. Leadership at the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Young served as President of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), from 1969 to 1971. He took office at a time of fiscal instability in the association and uncertainty about President Nixon's continuing commitment to the \\"War on Poverty\\" and to ending the war in Vietnam. At the 1969 NASW Delegate Assembly Young stated, > First of all, I think the country is in deep trouble. We, as a country have > blazed unimagined trails technologically and industrially. We have not yet > begun to pioneer in those things that are human and social‚Ä¶ I think that > social work is uniquely equipped to play a major role in this social and > human renaissance of our society, which will, if successful, lead to its > survival, and if it is unsuccessful, will lead to its justifiable death. > :‚ÄîNASW News, May 1969 Whitney Young Young spent his tenure as President of NASW ensuring that the profession kept pace with the troubling social and human challenges it was facing. NASW News articles document his call to action for social workers to address social welfare through poverty reduction, race reconciliation, and putting an end to the War in Vietnam. In the NASW News, July 1970, he challenged his professional social work organization to take leadership in the national struggle for social welfare: > The crisis in health and welfare services in our nation today highlights for > NASW what many of us have been stressing for a long time: inherent in the > responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for > professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but > merely two faces of the same coin to be spent on more and better services > for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad > definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking > leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future > direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same. The NASW News, May 1971, tribute to Young noted that \\"As usual Whitney Young was preparing to do battle on the major issues and programs facing the association and the nation. And he was doing it with his usual aplomb-dapper, self-assured, ready to deal with the \\"power\\" people to bring about change for the powerless.\\" Young was also the Dean of the school of Social Work at Clark Atlanta University, which now bears his name. In his last column as President for NASW, Young wrote, \\"whatever we do we should tell the public what we are doing and why. They have to hear from social workers as much as they hear from reporters and government officials.\\" Death On March 11, 1971, Young drowned while swimming with friends in Lagos, Nigeria, where he was attending a conference sponsored by the African-American Institute. President Nixon sent a plane to Nigeria to collect Young's body and traveled to Kentucky to deliver the eulogy at Young's funeral. He was originally buried in Lexington's Cove Haven (or Greenwood) Cemetery, but his widow had his body removed to Ferncliff Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York due to the condition of Cove Haven, and the possibility of vandalism. Legacy In his eulogy, Nixon stated that Young's legacy was that \\"he knew how to accomplish what other people were merely for\\". Young's work was considered instrumental in breaking down the barriers of segregation and inequality that held back African Americans. =Namesakes= Many sites across the country are named after Young or have memorials dedicated to him. For instance, in 1973, the East Capitol Street Bridge in Washington, D.C., was renamed the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge in his honor. Young's birthplace (Whitney Young Birthplace and Museum) in Shelby County, Kentucky is a designated National Historic Landmark, with a museum dedicated to Young's life and achievements. Young was honored in 1981 by the United States Postal Service on a postage stamp issued as part of its ongoing Black Heritage series.Whitney M. Young, Jr. U.S. Stamp Gallery. The Whitney Young School of Honors and Liberal Studies at Kentucky State University was named after him. Also, Clark Atlanta University named its School of Social Work, where Whitney Young served as Dean, in Young's honor. The Whitney M. Young School of Social Work is well known for founding the \\"Afro-Centric\\" perspective of social work. The Boy Scouts of America created the Whitney M. Young Jr. Service Award to recognize outstanding services by an adult individual or an organization for demonstrated involvement in the development and implementation of Scouting opportunities for youth from rural or low- income urban backgrounds. In 1973, The African American MBA Association at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania held its first Annual Whitney M. Young Jr. Memorial Conference. After 38 years, the Whitney M. Young Jr. Memorial Conference is the longest student-run conference held at The Wharton School. The America center in Lagos, Nigeria located within the U.S. Consulate which was formerly the Information resource center in Lagos has also been named after him. Schools named after Young include Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in Chicago, Whitney M. Young Gifted & Talented Leadership Academy in Cleveland, Ohio, Whitney Young Early Childhood Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Whitney M. Young Elementary in Dallas, Texas. The Whitney M. Young Health Center in Albany, New York was also named after him. The American Institute of Architects honors annually a recipient of the Whitney Young Jr award. In 2019 this award was received by Karen Braitmayer for her contributions to universal design https://www.architectmagazine.com/awards/aia-honor-awards/karen-braitmayer- wins-2019-aia-whitney-m-young-jr-award_o In movies The documentary, The Powerbroker: Whitney Young's Fight for Civil Rights, directed by Christine Khalafian and Taylor Hamilton, chronicles Young's rise from segregated Kentucky to the national movement for civil rights. The film includes archival footage, photos, and interviews compiled by Young's niece, award-winning journalist Bonnie Boswell Hamilton. Interviews include Henry Louis Gates Jr., Ossie Davis, Julian Bond, Roy Innis, Vernon Jordan, Dorothy Height, and Donald Rumsfeld.

In order to phase out fossil fuels and limit global warming, hydrogen is starting to be used as it can be created from water, and its combustion only releases water to the atmosphere. Hydrogen is a powerful fuel, and a frequent component in rocket fuel, but there exist numerous technical challenges preventing the creation of a large-scale hydrogen economy. These include the difficulty of developing long-term storage, pipelines and engine equipment due to hydrogen embrittlement, a relative lack of off-the-shelf engine technology that can currently run safely on hydrogen, safety concerns due to the high reactivity of hydrogen fuel with environmental oxygen in the air, and a lack of efficient photochemical water splitting technology to provide sufficient fuel. The hydrogen economy is nevertheless slowly developing as a small part of the low- carbon economy. , hydrogen is mainly used as an industrial feedstock, primarily for the production of ammonia, methanol and petroleum refining. Hydrogen gas does not occur naturally in convenient reservoirs. , almost all (95%) of the world's 70 million tons of hydrogen consumed yearly in industrial processing are produced by steam methane reforming (SMR). Small amounts of hydrogen (5%) are produced by the dedicated production of hydrogen from water, usually as a byproduct of the process of generating chlorine from seawater. there is not enough cheap clean electricity (renewable and nuclear) for this hydrogen to become a significant part of the low-carbon economy, and carbon dioxide is a by-product of the SMR process, but it can be captured and stored.  Rationale  Elements of the hydrogen economy In the current hydrocarbon economy, heating is fueled primarily by natural gas and transportation by petroleum. Burning of hydrocarbon fuels emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants. The demand for energy is increasing, particularly in China, India, and other developing countries. Hydrogen can be an environmentally cleaner source of energy to end-users, without release of pollutants such as particulates or carbon dioxide. Hydrogen has a high energy density by weight but has a low energy density by volume. Even when highly compressed, stored in solids, or liquified, the energy density by volume is only 1/4 that of gasoline, although the energy density by weight is approximately three times that of gasoline or natural gas. Hydrogen can help to decarbonize long-haul transport, chemicals, and iron and steel and has the potential to transport renewable energy long distance and store it long term, for example from wind power or solar electricity.  History  The term hydrogen economy was coined by John Bockris during a talk he gave in 1970 at General Motors (GM) Technical Center. The concept was proposed earlier by geneticist J.B.S. Haldane.Daedalus or Science and the Future, A paper read to the Heretics, Cambridge, on February 4th, 1923 - Transcript 1993 A hydrogen economy was proposed by the University of Michigan to solve some of the negative effects of using hydrocarbon fuels where the carbon is released to the atmosphere (as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, etc.). Modern interest in the hydrogen economy can generally be traced to a 1970 technical report by Lawrence W. Jones of the University of Michigan. A spike in attention for the concept during the 2000s was repeatedly described as hype by some critics and proponents of alternative technologies. ƒ∞nterest in the energy carrier resurged in the 2010s, notably by the forming of the Hydrogen Council in 2017. Several manufacturers released hydrogen fuel cell cars commercially, with manufacturers such as Toyota and industry groups in China planning to increase numbers of the cars into the hundreds of thousands over the next decade. Current hydrogen market Timeline Hydrogen production is a large and growing industry: with about 70 million tonnes of dedicated production per year, larger than the primary energy supply of Germany. fertiliser production and oil refining are the main uses. About half is used in the Haber process to produce ammonia (NH3), which is then used directly or indirectly as fertilizer. Because both the world population and the intensive agriculture used to support it are growing, ammonia demand is growing. Ammonia can be used as a safer and easier indirect method of transporting hydrogen. Transported ammonia can be then converted back to hydrogen at the bowser by a membrane technology.Mealey, Rachel. ‚ÄùAutomotive hydrogen membranes-huge breakthrough for cars\\", ABC, August 8, 2018 The other half of current hydrogen production is used to convert heavy petroleum sources into lighter fractions suitable for use as fuels. This latter process is known as hydrocracking. Hydrocracking represents an even larger growth area, since rising oil prices encourage oil companies to extract poorer source material, such as oil sands and oil shale. The scale economies inherent in large-scale oil refining and fertilizer manufacture make possible on-site production and \\"captive\\" use. Smaller quantities of \\"merchant\\" hydrogen are manufactured and delivered to end users as well. almost all hydrogen production is from fossil fuels, and emits 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The distribution of production reflects the effects of thermodynamic constraints on economic choices: of the four methods for obtaining hydrogen, partial combustion of natural gas in a NGCC (natural gas combined cycle) power plant offers the most efficient chemical pathway and the greatest off-take of usable heat energy. The large market and sharply rising prices in fossil fuels have also stimulated great interest in alternate, cheaper means of hydrogen production. As of 2002, most hydrogen is produced on site and the cost is approximately $0.70/kg and, if not produced on site, the cost of liquid hydrogen is about $2.20/kg to $3.08/kg. Production, storage, infrastructure Today's hydrogen is mainly produced (>90%) from fossil sources. =Methods of production= Molecular hydrogen was discovered in the Kola Superdeep Borehole. It is unclear how much molecular hydrogen is available in natural reservoirs, but at least one company specializes in drilling wells to extract hydrogen. Most hydrogen in the lithosphere is bonded to oxygen in water. Manufacturing elemental hydrogen requires the consumption of a hydrogen carrier such as a fossil fuel or water. The former carrier consumes the fossil resource and produces carbon dioxide, but often requires no further energy input beyond the fossil fuel. Decomposing water, the latter carrier, requires electrical or heat input, generated from some primary energy source (fossil fuel, nuclear power or a renewable energy). Hydrogen can also be produced by refining the effluent from geothermal sources in the lithosphere. Hydrogen produced by zero emission energy sources such as electrolysis of water using wind power, solar power, nuclear power, hydro power, wave power or tidal power is referred to as green hydrogen. Hydrogen produced from coal may be referred to as brown hydrogen, and when fossil fuel derived, is generally referred to as grey hydrogen. When derived from natural gas, if the carbon dioxide is captured, it is referred to as blue hydrogen. =Current production methods= Hydrogen is industrially produced from steam reforming, which uses natural gas. The energy content of the produced hydrogen is less than the energy content of the original fuel, some of it being lost as excess heat during production. Steam reforming emits carbon dioxide. A small part (2% in 2019) is produced by electrolysis using electricity and water, consuming approximately 50 to 55 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilogram of hydrogen produced.  Electrolysis of water  Hydrogen can be made via high pressure electrolysis, low pressure electrolysis of water, or a range of other emerging electrochemical processes such as high temperature electrolysis or carbon assisted electrolysis. However, current best processes for water electrolysis have an effective electrical efficiency of 70-80%, so that producing 1 kg of hydrogen (which has a specific energy of 143 MJ/kg or about 40 kWh/kg) requires 50‚Äì55 kWh of electricity. In parts of the world, steam methane reforming is between $1‚Äì3/kg on average excluding hydrogen gas pressurization cost. This makes production of hydrogen via electrolysis cost competitive in many regions already, as outlined by Nel Hydrogen and others, including an article by the IEA examining the conditions which could lead to a competitive advantage for electrolysis.  Kv√¶rner process  The Kv√¶rner process or Kvaerner carbon black & hydrogen process (CB&H;) is a method, developed in the 1980s by a Norwegian company of the same name, for the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons (CnHm), such as methane, natural gas and biogas. Of the available energy of the feed, approximately 48% is contained in the hydrogen, 40% is contained in activated carbon and 10% in superheated steam.https://www.hfpeurope.org/infotools/energyinfos__e/hydrogen/main03.html =Experimental production methods=  Biological production  Fermentative hydrogen production is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen manifested by a diverse group of bacteria using multi enzyme systems involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Dark fermentation reactions do not require light energy, so they are capable of constantly producing hydrogen from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Photofermentation differs from dark fermentation because it only proceeds in the presence of light. For example, photo-fermentation with Rhodobacter sphaeroides SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen. Electrohydrogenesis is used in microbial fuel cells where hydrogen is produced from organic matter (e.g. from sewage, or solid matter) while 0.2 - 0.8 V is applied. Biological hydrogen can be produced in an algae bioreactor. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if the algae is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen, i.e. normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. Biological hydrogen can be produced in bioreactors that use feedstocks other than algae, the most common feedstock being waste streams. The process involves bacteria feeding on hydrocarbons and excreting hydrogen and CO2. The CO2 can be sequestered successfully by several methods, leaving hydrogen gas. In 2006-2007, NanoLogix first demonstrated a prototype hydrogen bioreactor using waste as a feedstock at Welch's grape juice factory in North East, Pennsylvania (U.S.).  Biocatalysed electrolysis  Besides regular electrolysis, electrolysis using microbes is another possibility. With biocatalysed electrolysis, hydrogen is generated after running through the microbial fuel cell and a variety of aquatic plants can be used. These include reed sweetgrass, cordgrass, rice, tomatoes, lupines, and algae  High-pressure electrolysis  High pressure electrolysis is the electrolysis of water by decomposition of water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) by means of an electric current being passed through the water. The difference with a standard electrolyzer is the compressed hydrogen output around 120-200 bar (1740-2900 psi, 12‚Äì20 MPa). By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, through a process known as chemical compression, the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated, the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%. European largest (1 400 000 kg/a, High-pressure Electrolysis of water, alkaline technology) hydrogen production plant is operating at Kokkola, Finland. Finland exporting TEN-T fuel stations  High-temperature electrolysis  Hydrogen can be generated from energy supplied in the form of heat and electricity through high-temperature electrolysis (HTE). Because some of the energy in HTE is supplied in the form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so potentially far less energy is required per kilogram of hydrogen produced. While nuclear-generated electricity could be used for electrolysis, nuclear heat can be directly applied to split hydrogen from water. High temperature (950‚Äì1000 ¬∞C) gas cooled nuclear reactors have the potential to split hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat. Research into high-temperature nuclear reactors may eventually lead to a hydrogen supply that is cost-competitive with natural gas steam reforming. General Atomics predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) would cost $1.53/kg. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. In 2005 natural gas prices, hydrogen costs $2.70/kg. High-temperature electrolysis has been demonstrated in a laboratory, at 108 MJ (thermal) per kilogram of hydrogen produced, but not at a commercial scale. In addition, this is lower-quality \\"commercial\\" grade Hydrogen, unsuitable for use in fuel cells.  Photoelectrochemical water splitting  Using electricity produced by photovoltaic systems offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen. Water is broken into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis‚Äîa photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) process which is also named artificial photosynthesis. William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices demonstrated and patented the first multijunction high efficiency photoelectrochemical system for direct splitting of water in 1983.William Ayers, US Patent 4,466,869 Photolytic Production of Hydrogen This group demonstrated direct water splitting now referred to as an \\"artificial leaf\\" or \\"wireless solar water splitting\\" with a low cost thin film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved off the back metal substrate. A Nafion membrane above the multijunction cell provided a path for ion transport. Their patent also lists a variety of other semiconductor multijunction materials for the direct water splitting in addition to amorphous silicon and silicon germanium alloys. Research continues towards developing high-efficiency multi-junction cell technology at universities and the photovoltaic industry. If this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using photovoltaic and an electrolytic system, the reaction is in just one step, which can improve efficiency.  Photoelectrocatalytic production  A method studied by Thomas Nann and his team at the University of East Anglia consists of a gold electrode covered in layers of indium phosphide (InP) nanoparticles. They introduced an iron-sulfur complex into the layered arrangement, which when submerged in water and irradiated with light under a small electric current, produced hydrogen with an efficiency of 60%. In 2015, it was reported that Panasonic Corp. has developed a photocatalyst based on niobium nitride that can absorb 57% of sunlight to support the decomposition of water to produce hydrogen gas. The company plans to achieve commercial application \\"as early as possible\\", not before 2020.  Concentrating solar thermal  Very high temperatures are required to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen. A catalyst is required to make the process operate at feasible temperatures. Heating the water can be achieved through the use of water concentrating solar power. Hydrosol-2 is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almer√≠a in Spain which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200 ¬∞C to heat water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to the megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to heliostat fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.  Thermochemical production  There are more than 352 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting,UNLV Thermochemical cycle automated scoring database (public) around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle, cerium(IV) oxide-cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle, sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity. These processes can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis, typical in the range from 35% - 49% LHV efficiency. Thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient. None of the thermochemical hydrogen production processes have been demonstrated at production levels, although several have been demonstrated in laboratories. =Hydrogen as a byproduct of other chemical processes= The industrial production of chlorine and caustic soda by electrolysis generates a sizable amount of Hydrogen as a byproduct. In the port of Antwerp a 1MW demonstration fuel cell power plant is powered by such byproduct. This unit has been operational since late 2011.http://www.nedstack.com/images/stories/news/documents/20120202_Press%20release%20Solvay%20PEM%20Power%20Plant%20start%20up.pdf Nedstack The excess hydrogen is often managed with a hydrogen pinch analysis. Gas generated from coke ovens in steel production is similar to Syngas with 60% hydrogen by volume. The hydrogen can be extracted from the coke oven gas economically. =Storage= Although molecular hydrogen has very high energy density on a mass basis, partly because of its low molecular weight, as a gas at ambient conditions it has very low energy density by volume. If it is to be used as fuel stored on board the vehicle, pure hydrogen gas must be stored in an energy-dense form to provide sufficient driving range. Pressurized hydrogen gas Increasing gas pressure improves the energy density by volume making for smaller container tanks. Tanks made of carbon and glass fibres reinforcing plastic as fitted in Toyota Marai and Kenworth trucks are required to meet safety standards. Few materials are suitable for tanks as hydrogen being a small molecule tends to diffuse through many liner materials and hydrogen embrittlement causes weakening in some types of metal containers. The most common on board hydrogen storage in today's 2020 vehicles is hydrogen at pressure 700bar = 70MPa. Liquid hydrogen Alternatively, higher volumetric energy density liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used. However, liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268 K (‚Äì252.882 ¬∞C or ‚Äì423.188 ¬∞F). Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving pressurizing and cooling steps, is energy intensive. The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately a factor of four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen ‚Äî there is actually more hydrogen in a litre of gasoline (116 grams) than there is in a litre of pure liquid hydrogen (71 grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off. Japan have a liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage facility at a terminal in Kobe, and are expected to receive the first shipment of liquid hydrogen via LH2 carrier in 2020. Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253 ¬∞C, similar to liquified natural gas (LNG) which is stored at -162 ¬∞C. A potential efficiency loss of 12.79% can be achieved, or 4.26kWh/kg out of 33.3kWh/kg. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) Storage as hydride Distinct from storing molecular hydrogen, hydrogen can be stored as a chemical hydride or in some other hydrogen-containing compound. Hydrogen gas is reacted with some other materials to produce the hydrogen storage material, which can be transported relatively easily. At the point of use the hydrogen storage material can be made to decompose, yielding hydrogen gas. As well as the mass and volume density problems associated with molecular hydrogen storage, current barriers to practical storage schemes stem from the high pressure and temperature conditions needed for hydride formation and hydrogen release. For many potential systems hydriding and dehydriding kinetics and heat management are also issues that need to be overcome. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on Magnesium Hydrate, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL. Emergent hydride hydrogen storage technologies have achieved a compressed volume of less than 1/500. Adsorption A third approach is to adsorb molecular hydrogen on the surface of a solid storage material. Unlike in the hydrides mentioned above, the hydrogen does not dissociate/recombine upon charging/discharging the storage system, and hence does not suffer from the kinetic limitations of many hydride storage systems. Hydrogen densities similar to liquefied hydrogen can be achieved with appropriate adsorbent materials. Some suggested adsorbents include activated carbon, nanostructured carbons (including CNTs), MOFs, and hydrogen clathrate hydrate. Underground hydrogen storage 'Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.' COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT Energy storage ‚Äì the role of electricity Underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in caverns, salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields. Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in caverns by ICI for many years without any difficulties.1994 ‚Äì ECN abstract. Hyweb.de. Retrieved on 2012-01-08. The storage of large quantities of liquid hydrogen underground can function as grid energy storage. The round- trip efficiency is approximately 40% (vs. 75-80% for pumped-hydro (PHES)), and the cost is slightly higher than pumped hydro.European Renewable Energy Network pp. 86, 188 Another study referenced by a European staff working paper found that for large scale storage, the cheapest option is hydrogen at ‚Ç¨140/MWh for 2,000 hours of storage using an electrolyser, salt cavern storage and combined-cycle power plant. The European project Hyunder indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it cannot be covered by PHES and CAES systems.Storing renewable energy: Is hydrogen a viable solution? A German case study on storage of hydrogen in salt caverns found that if the German power surplus (7% of total variable renewable generation by 2025 and 20% by 2050) would be converted to hydrogen and stored underground, these quantities would require some 15 caverns of 500,000 cubic metres each by 2025 and some 60 caverns by 2050 ‚Äì corresponding to approximately one third of the number of gas caverns currently operated in Germany. In the US, Sandia Labs are conducting research into the storage of hydrogen in depleted oil and gas fields, which could easily absorb large amounts of renewably produced hydrogen as there are some 2.7 million depleted wells in existence. Power to gas Power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel. There are 2 methods, the first is to use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada. Pipeline storage A natural gas network may be used for the storage of hydrogen. Before switching to natural gas, the UK and German gas networks were operated using towngas, which for the most part consisted of hydrogen. The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GWh which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW¬∑h. Similarly UK pumped storage is far less than the gas network. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (<0.1%) than in a power network (8%). The use of the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy.Naturalhy Ad van Wijk, a professor at Future Energy Systems TU Delft, also discusses the possibility of producing electricity in areas or countries with much sunlight (Sahara, Chile, Mexico, Namibia, Australia, New Zealand, ...) and transporting it (via ship, pipeline, ...) to the Netherlands. This being economically seen, still cheaper than producing it locally in the Netherlands. He also mentions that the energy transport capacity of gas lines are far higher than that of electricity lines coming into private houses (in the Netherlands) -30 kW vs 3 kW-.Kijk magazine, 10, 201950% hydrogen for Europe. A manifesto by Frank Wouters and Ad van Wijk =Infrastructure= right The hydrogen infrastructure would consist mainly of industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those found on a hydrogen highway. Hydrogen stations which were not situated near a hydrogen pipeline would get supply via hydrogen tanks, compressed hydrogen tube trailers, liquid hydrogen trailers, liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production. Because of hydrogen embrittlement of steel, and corrosionIdaho National Engineering Laboratory's recommendation for Gaseous Hydrogen: Stainless steel Accessed 2010-10-13Stuart Island Energy Initiative Website Accessed 2010-10-13: Hydrogen has an active electron, and therefore behaves somewhat like a Halogen. The recommended pipe material is stainless steel. natural gas pipes require internal coatings or replacement in order to convey hydrogen. Techniques are well-known; over 700 miles of hydrogen pipeline currently exist in the United States. Although expensive, pipelines are the cheapest way to move hydrogen. Hydrogen gas piping is routine in large oil-refineries, because hydrogen is used to hydrocrack fuels from crude oil. Hydrogen piping can in theory be avoided in distributed systems of hydrogen production, where hydrogen is routinely made on site using medium or small-sized generators which would produce enough hydrogen for personal use or perhaps a neighborhood. In the end, a combination of options for hydrogen gas distribution may succeed. The IEA recommends existing industrial ports be used for production and existing natural gas pipelines for transport: also international co-operation and shipping. South Korea and Japan, which as of 2019 lack international electrical interconnectors, are investing in the hydrogen economy. In March 2020, a production facility was opened in Namie, Fukushima Prefecture, claimed to be the world's largest. A key tradeoff: centralized vs. distributed production In a future full hydrogen economy, primary energy sources and feedstock would be used to produce hydrogen gas as stored energy for use in various sectors of the economy. Producing hydrogen from primary energy sources other than coal, oil, and natural gas, would result in lower production of the greenhouse gases characteristic of the combustion of these fossil energy resources. One key feature of a hydrogen economy would be that in mobile applications (primarily vehicular transport) energy generation and use could be decoupled. The primary energy source would need no longer travel with the vehicle, as it currently does with hydrocarbon fuels. Instead of tailpipes creating dispersed emissions, the energy (and pollution) could be generated from point sources such as large-scale, centralized facilities with improved efficiency. This would allow the possibility of technologies such as carbon sequestration, which are otherwise impossible for mobile applications. Alternatively, distributed energy generation schemes (such as small scale renewable energy sources) could be used, possibly associated with hydrogen stations. Aside from the energy generation, hydrogen production could be centralized, distributed or a mixture of both. While generating hydrogen at centralized primary energy plants promises higher hydrogen production efficiency, difficulties in high- volume, long range hydrogen transportation (due to factors such as hydrogen damage and the ease of hydrogen diffusion through solid materials) makes electrical energy distribution attractive within a hydrogen economy. In such a scenario, small regional plants or even local filling stations could generate hydrogen using energy provided through the electrical distribution grid. While hydrogen generation efficiency is likely to be lower than for centralized hydrogen generation, losses in hydrogen transport could make such a scheme more efficient in terms of the primary energy used per kilogram of hydrogen delivered to the end user. The proper balance between hydrogen distribution and long-distance electrical distribution is one of the primary questions that arises about the hydrogen economy. Again the dilemmas of production sources and transportation of hydrogen can now be overcome using on site (home, business, or fuel station) generation of hydrogen from off grid renewable sources..  Distributed electrolysis  Distributed electrolysis would bypass the problems of distributing hydrogen by distributing electricity instead. It would use existing electrical networks to transport electricity to small, on-site electrolysers located at filling stations. However, accounting for the energy used to produce the electricity and transmission losses would reduce the overall efficiency.  Uses  = For heating and cooking instead of natural gas = Hydrogen can replace some or all of the natural gas in gas grids. the maximum in a grid is 20%. = Fuel cells as alternative to internal combustion and electric batteries= One of the main offerings of a hydrogen economy is that the fuel can replace the fossil fuel burned in internal combustion engines and turbines as the primary way to convert chemical energy into kinetic or electrical energy, thereby eliminating greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from that engine. Ad van Wijk, a professor at Future Energy Systems TU Delft also mentions that hydrogen is better for larger vehicles - such as trucks, buses and ships - than electric batteries. This because a 1 kg battery, , can store 0.1 kWh of energy whereas 1 kg of hydrogen has a usable capacity of 33 kWh. Although hydrogen can be used in conventional internal combustion engines, fuel cells, being electrochemical, have a theoretical efficiency advantage over heat engines. Fuel cells are more expensive to produce than common internal combustion engines. Some types of fuel cells work with hydrocarbon fuels,Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells, Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008 while all can be operated on pure hydrogen. In the event that fuel cells become price- competitive with internal combustion engines and turbines, large gas-fired power plants could adopt this technology. Hydrogen gas must be distinguished as \\"technical-grade\\" (five nines pure, 99.999%), which is suitable for applications such as fuel cells, and \\"commercial-grade\\", which has carbon- and sulfur-containing impurities, but which can be produced by the much cheaper steam-reformation process. Fuel cells require high-purity hydrogen because the impurities would quickly degrade the life of the fuel cell stack. Much of the interest in the hydrogen economy concept is focused on the use of fuel cells to power hydrogen vehicles. Current hydrogen fuel cells suffer from a low power-to-weight ratio. Fuel cells are much more efficient than internal combustion engines, and produce no harmful emissions. If a practical method of hydrogen storage is introduced, and fuel cells become cheaper, they can be economically viable to power hybrid fuel cell/battery vehicles, or purely fuel cell-driven ones. The economic viability of fuel cell powered vehicles will improve as the use of internal combustion engine vehicles becomes more expensive because of charges to cover the costs of their air pollution, through such measures as carbon taxes and low-emission zones. The combination of the fuel cell and electric motor is 2-3 times more efficient than an internal-combustion engine. Capital costs of fuel cells have reduced significantly over recent years, with a modeled cost of $50/kW cited by the Department of Energy. Previous technical obstacles have included hydrogen storage issuesR&D; of large stationary hydrogen/CNG/HCNG storage vessels and the purity requirement of hydrogen used in fuel cells, as with current technology, an operating fuel cell requires the purity of hydrogen to be as high as 99.999%. Other fuel cell technologies based on the exchange of metal ions (e.g. zinc-air fuel cells) are typically more efficient at energy conversion than hydrogen fuel cells, but the widespread use of any electrical energy ‚Üí chemical energy ‚Üí electrical energy systems would necessitate the production of electricity. = Use as a transport fuel and system efficiency = An accounting of the energy utilized during a thermodynamic process, known as an energy balance, can be applied to automotive fuels. With today's technology, the manufacture of hydrogen via steam reforming can be accomplished with a thermal efficiency of 75 to 80 percent. Additional energy will be required to liquefy or compress the hydrogen, and to transport it to the filling station via truck or pipeline. The energy that must be utilized per kilogram to produce, transport and deliver hydrogen (i.e., its well-to- tank energy use) is approximately 50 MJ using technology available in 2004. Subtracting this energy from the enthalpy of one kilogram of hydrogen, which is 141 MJ, and dividing by the enthalpy, yields a thermal energy efficiency of roughly 60%.Kreith, 2004 Gasoline, by comparison, requires less energy input, per gallon, at the refinery, and comparatively little energy is required to transport it and store it owing to its high energy density per gallon at ambient temperatures. Well-to-tank, the supply chain for gasoline is roughly 80% efficient (Wang, 2002). Another grid-based method of supplying hydrogen would be to use electrical to run electrolysers. Roughly 6% of electricity is lost during transmission along power lines, and the process of converting the fossil fuel to electricity in the first place is roughly 33 percent efficient. Mirror Thus if efficiency is the key determinant it would be unlikely hydrogen vehicles would be fueled by such a method, and indeed viewed this way, electric vehicles would appear to be a better choice. However, as noted above, hydrogen can be produced from a number of feedstocks, in centralized or distributed fashion, and these afford more efficient pathways to produce and distribute the fuel. A study of the well-to-wheels efficiency of hydrogen vehicles compared to other vehicles in the Norwegian energy system indicates that hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) tend to be about a third as efficient as EVs when electrolysis is used, with hydrogen Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) being barely a sixth as efficient. Even in the case where hydrogen fuel cells get their hydrogen from natural gas reformation rather than electrolysis, and EVs get their power from a natural gas power plant, the EVs still come out ahead 35% to 25% (and only 13% for a H2 ICE). This compares to 14% for a gasoline ICE, 27% for a gasoline ICE hybrid, and 17% for a diesel ICE, also on a well-to-wheels basis. Hydrogen has been called one of the least efficient and most expensive possible replacements for gasoline (petrol) in terms of reducing greenhouse gases; other technologies may be less expensive and more quickly implemented. A comprehensive study of hydrogen in transportation applications has found that \\"there are major hurdles on the path to achieving the vision of the hydrogen economy; the path will not be simple or straightforward\\". Although Ford Motor Company and French Renault- Nissan cancelled their hydrogen car R&D; efforts in 2008 and 2009, respectively,\\"Ford Motor Company Business Plan\\", December 2, 2008Dennis, Lyle. \\"Nissan Swears Off Hydrogen and Will Only Build Electric Cars\\", All Cars Electric, February 26, 2009 they signed a 2009 letter of intent with the other manufacturers and Now GMBH in September 2009 supporting the commercial introduction of FCVs by 2015.Letter of Understanding 2009 A study by The Carbon Trust for the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport with near- zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation. However, the technologies face very difficult challenges, in terms of cost, performance and policy. \\"Hydrogen for transport\\", The Carbon Trust, 28 November 2014. Retrieved on 20 January 2015. An Otto-cycle internal-combustion engine running on hydrogen is said to have a maximum efficiency of about 38%, 8% higher than a gasoline internal-combustion engine.BMW Group Clean Energy ZEV Symposium. September 2006, p. 12 In the short term hydrogen has been proposed as a method of reducing harmful diesel exhaust. Safety Hydrogen has one of the widest explosive/ignition mix range with air of all the gases with few exceptions such as acetylene, silane, and ethylene oxide. This means that whatever the mix proportion between air and hydrogen, when ignited a hydrogen leak will most likely lead to an explosion, not a mere flame. This makes the use of hydrogen particularly dangerous in enclosed areas such as tunnels or underground parking. Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames burn in the ultraviolet color range and are nearly invisible to the naked eye, so a flame detector is needed to detect if a hydrogen leak is burning. Hydrogen is odorless and leaks cannot be detected by smell. Hydrogen codes and standards are codes and standards for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications. There are codes and standards for the safe handling and storage of hydrogen, for example the standard for the installation of stationary fuel cell power systems from the National Fire Protection Association. Codes and standards have repeatedly been identified as a major institutional barrier to deploying hydrogen technologies and developing a hydrogen economy. international standards are needed for the transport, storage and traceability of environmental impact. One of the measures on the roadmap is to implement higher safety standards like early leak detection with hydrogen sensors. The Canadian Hydrogen Safety Program concluded that hydrogen fueling is as safe as, or safer than, compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling. The European Commission has funded the first higher educational program in the world in hydrogen safety engineering at the University of Ulster. It is expected that the general public will be able to use hydrogen technologies in everyday life with at least the same level of safety and comfort as with today's fossil fuels. Costs H2 production cost ($-gge untaxed) at varying natural gas prices Although much of an existing natural gas grid could be reused with 100% hydrogen, eliminating natural gas from a large area such as Britain would require huge investment. And switching from natural gas to low-carbon heating is more costly if the carbon costs of natural gas are not reflected in its price. Power plant capacity that now goes unused at night could be used to produce green hydrogen, but this would not be enough, therefore blue hydrogen with carbon capture and storage is needed, possibly after autothermal reforming of methane rather than steam methane reforming. green hydrogen costs between $2.50-6.80 per kilogram and blue hydrogen $1.40-2.40/kg compared with high-carbon grey hydrogen at $1‚Äì1.80/kg. Deployment of hydrogen can provide a cost-effective option to displace fossil fuels in applications where emissions reductions would otherwise be impractical and/or expensive. These may include heat for buildings and industry, conversion of natural gas-fired power stations, and fuel for aviation and possibly heavy trucks.  Examples and pilot programs  A Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro powered by hydrogen fuel cells, in Brno, Czech Republic. Several domestic U.S. automobile manufactures have committed to develop vehicles using hydrogen. The distribution of hydrogen for the purpose of transportation is currently being tested around the world, particularly in the US (California, Massachusetts), Canada, Japan, the EU (Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Germany), and Iceland, but the cost is very high. The United States have their own hydrogen policy. A joint venture between NREL and Xcel Energy is combining wind power and hydrogen power in the same way in Colorado. Hydro in Newfoundland and Labrador are converting the current wind- diesel Power System on the remote island of Ramea into a Wind-Hydrogen Hybrid Power Systems facility. A similar pilot project on Stuart Island uses solar power, instead of wind power, to generate electricity. When excess electricity is available after the batteries are fully charged, hydrogen is generated by electrolysis and stored for later production of electricity by fuel cell. The US also have a large natural gas pipeline system already in place.Hydrogen transport & distribution Countries in the EU which have a relatively large natural gas pipeline system already in place include Belgium, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In 2020, The EU launched its European Clean Hydrogen Alliance (ECHA).ECHA The UK started a fuel cell pilot program in January 2004, the program ran two Fuel cell buses on route 25 in London until December 2005, and switched to route RV1 until January 2007. The Hydrogen Expedition is currently working to create a hydrogen fuel cell-powered ship and using it to circumnavigate the globe, as a way to demonstrate the capability of hydrogen fuel cells. Western Australia's Department of Planning and Infrastructure operated three Daimler Chrysler Citaro fuel cell buses as part of its Sustainable Transport Energy for Perth Fuel Cells Bus Trial in Perth. The buses were operated by Path Transit on regular Transperth public bus routes. The trial began in September 2004 and concluded in September 2007. The buses' fuel cells used a proton exchange membrane system and were supplied with raw hydrogen from a BP refinery in Kwinana, south of Perth. The hydrogen was a byproduct of the refinery's industrial process. The buses were refueled at a station in the northern Perth suburb of Malaga. Iceland has committed to becoming the world's first hydrogen economy by the year 2050. Iceland is in a unique position. Presently, it imports all the petroleum products necessary to power its automobiles and fishing fleet. Iceland has large geothermal resources, so much that the local price of electricity actually is lower than the price of the hydrocarbons that could be used to produce that electricity. Iceland already converts its surplus electricity into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements. In 2002, it produced 2,000 tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis, primarily for the production of ammonia (NH3) for fertilizer. Ammonia is produced, transported, and used throughout the world, and 90% of the cost of ammonia is the cost of the energy to produce it. Neither industry directly replaces hydrocarbons. Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, had a small pilot fleet of city buses running on compressed hydrogen, and research on powering the nation's fishing fleet with hydrogen is under way (for example by companies as Icelandic New Energy). For more practical purposes, Iceland might process imported oil with hydrogen to extend it, rather than to replace it altogether. The Reykjav√≠k buses are part of a larger program, HyFLEET:CUTE, operating hydrogen fueled buses in eight European cities. HyFLEET:CUTE buses were also operated in Beijing, China and Perth, Australia (see below). A pilot project demonstrating a hydrogen economy is operational on the Norwegian island of Utsira. The installation combines wind power and hydrogen power. In periods when there is surplus wind energy, the excess power is used for generating hydrogen by electrolysis. The hydrogen is stored, and is available for power generation in periods when there is little wind. India is said to adopt hydrogen and H-CNG, due to several reasons, amongst which the fact that a national rollout of natural gas networks is already taking place and natural gas is already a major vehicle fuel. In addition, India suffers from extreme air pollution in urban areas.Hydrogen vehicles and refueling infrastructure in IndiaL. M.

A hydrogen forklift, a hydrogen cart and a mobile house powered by renewable energies are being demonstrated in UNIDO-ICHET's premises. An uninterruptible power supply system has been working since April 2009 in the headquarters of Istanbul Sea Buses company. Another indicator of the presence of large natural gas infrastructures already in place in countries and in use by citizens is the number of natural gas vehicles present in the country. The countries with the largest amount of natural gas vehicles are (in order of magnitude):Worldwide NGV statistics Iran, China, Pakistan, Argentina, India, Brasil, Italy, Colombia, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Bolivia, Armenia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Peru, Ukraine, United States. Natural gas vehicles can also be converted to run on hydrogen. Some hospitals have installed combined electrolyser-storage-fuel cell units for local emergency power. These are advantageous for emergency use because of their low maintenance requirement and ease of location compared to internal combustion driven generators. Also, in some private homes, fuel cell micro-CHP plants can be found, which can operate on hydrogen, or other fuels as natural gas or LPG.Fuel Cell micro CHPFuel cell micro Cogeneration When running on natural gas, it relies on steam reforming of natural gas to convert the natural gas to hydrogen prior to use in the fuel cell. This hence still emits CO2 (see reaction) but (temporarily) running on this can be a good solution until the point where the hydrogen is starting to be become distributed through the (natural gas) piping system.  Partial hydrogen economy  Hydrogen is simply a method to store and transmit energy. Energy development of various alternative energy transmission and storage scenarios which begin with hydrogen production, but do not use it for all parts of the store and transmission infrastructure, may be more economic, in both near and far term. These include: =Ammonia economy= An alternative to gaseous hydrogen as an energy carrier is to bond it with nitrogen from the air to produce ammonia, which can be easily liquefied, transported, and used (directly or indirectly) as a clean and renewable fuel. For example, researchers at CSIRO in Australia in 2018 fuelled a Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo with hydrogen separated from ammonia using a membrane technology. =Hybrid heat pumps= Hybrid heat pumps (not to be confused with air water hybrids) also include a boiler which could run on methane or hydrogen, and could be a pathway to full decarbonisation of residential heating as the boiler would be used to top up the heating when the weather was very cold.: \\"Near-term pursuit of hybrid heat pumps would not necessarily lead to a long-term solution of hybrid heat pumps with hydrogen boilers.\\" =Bio-SNG= although technically possible production of syngas from hydrogen and carbon-dioxide from bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) via the Sabatier reaction is limited by the amount of sustainable bioenergy available:: The potential for bio-gasification with CCS to be deployed at scale is limited by the amount of sustainable bioenergy available. .... \\" therefore any bio-SNG made may be reserved for production of aviation biofuel.: production of biofuels, even with CCS, is only one of the best uses of the finite sustainable bio-resource if the fossil fuels it displaces cannot otherwise feasibly be displaced (e.g. use of biomass to produce aviation biofuels with CCS).\\"  See also  * United States Hydrogen Policy * Alternative fuel * Energy development * Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Technology Initiative * Formic acid * Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle * Hydrogen prize * Hydrogen-powered aircraft * International Journal of Hydrogen Energy * Lolland Hydrogen Community * Methane pyrolysis References Sources * * External links * International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy * European Hydrogen Association Category:Emerging technologies ","title":"Hydrogen economy"},{"id":"906173","text":"Dentist on the Job is a 1961 British comedy film directed by C. M. Pennington- Richards, the sequel to Dentist in the Chair (1960). It was released in the US with the title Get On with It!. The film was co-written by Hugh Woodhouse and Hazel Adair. It stars Bob Monkhouse, Kenneth Connor, Ronnie Stevens and Eric Barker repeating their roles from the previous film. Other actors appearing in the film include Shirley Eaton, Richard Wattis and Charles Hawtrey. Monkhouse, Eaton, Connor, Barker and Hawtrey had all previously acted together in unrelated 1958 comedy Carry On Sergeant. Plot Colonel Proudfoot (Barker) of Proudfoot Industries aims to entice a couple of dentists to advertise \\"Dreem\\", a revolutionary type of toothpaste, but he knows that if the dentists learn that they are part of an advertising campaign, they will be struck off. His cousin, the director of a Dental School (also Barker), sees his chance to rid the field of dentistry of two newly qualified incompetents David Cookson and Brian Dexter (Monkhouse and Stevens). However, once employed by Proudfoot, they set about improving on Dreem's terrible formula, and accidentally succeed in creating a much better toothpaste. Their attempts to convince Proudfoot of its merits are foiled by Proudfoot's assistant, Macreedy (Wattis). They then read a newspaper article about the forthcoming launch of a rocket from a British base carrying a satellite which will continuously broadcast a taped message of peace from the President of the United States, and conceive a plan. They record an impromptu commercial for the new formula Dreem and, with the help of an ex-convict friend Sam Field (Connor) and actress Jill Venner (Eaton), manage to smuggle it aboard the rocket in place of the President's speech, guaranteeing Proudfoot years of free advertising. The resulting publicity ensures the product's success and the pair are promoted.

These alkaloids are of interest for their use in Amazonian shamanism, where they are derived from other plants. The harmala alkaloid harmine, once known as telepathine and banisterine, is a naturally occurring beta-carboline alkaloid that is structurally related to harmaline, and also found in the vine Banisteriopsis caapi. Tetrahydroharmine is also found in B. caapi and P. harmala. Dr. Alexander Shulgin has suggested that harmine may be a breakdown product of harmaline. Harmine and harmaline are reversible MAOIs of the MAO-A isoform of the enzyme, and can stimulate the central nervous system by inhibiting the metabolism of monoamine compounds such as serotonin and norepinephrine. The harmala alkaloids occur in Peganum harmala in concentrations of roughly 3%, though tests have documented anywhere from 2-7% or even higher, as natural sources tend to vary widely in chemical makeup. Harmala alkaloids are also found in the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, the key plant ingredient in the sacramental beverage Ayahuasca, in concentrations that range between 0.31-8.43% for harmine, 0.03-0.83% for harmaline and 0.05-2.94% for tetrahydroharmine.Callaway JC, Brito GS & Neves ES (2005). Phytochemical analyses of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 37(2): 145-150. Although other psychoactive plants are occasionally added to Ayahuasca to achieve visionary states of consciousness, the recipes vary greatly and no single combination is common. Peganum harmala, normally consumed as a tea or used as an incense, is mentioned in classical Persian literature both as a sacred sacrament and as a medicine. The harmala alkaloids are not especially psychedelic, even at higher dosages, when hypnagogic visions, alongside vomiting and diarrhea, become the main effect. Harmala alkaloids are also found in many other plants, such as passion flower. The leaves of P. incarnata have been reported variously to give 0.005%, 0.12 mg%, and nil, of harman alkaloids.  Telepathine  Telepathine was originally thought to be the active chemical constituent of Banisteriopsis caapi, a key plant ingredient in the preparation of ayahuasca; a sacramental beverage from the Amazon. This isolated chemical was so named because of the reported effects of Ayahuasca among the indigenous users, including: collective contact with and/or visions of jaguars, snakes, and jeweled birds, and ancestral spirits; the ability to see future events; and as the name suggests, telepathic communication among tribal members. It was assumed to be a newly discovered chemical at the time, however, it was soon realized that Telepathine was already more widely known as \\"harmine\\" from its previous discovery in Peganum harmala (Syrian Rue).  Uses  Harmaline and harmine fluoresce under ultraviolet light. These three extractions indicate that the middle one has a higher concentration of the two compounds. As mentioned above, some harmala alkaloids can be used as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) to facilitate the ingestion of DMT and other tryptamines; while not generally used as a hallucinogen alone, there are reports of such use.Shulgin, Alexander. \\"#13 Harmaline\\", Erowid Online Texts: TiHKAL #13 HARMALINE, retrieved November 26, 2006. In high doses, it acts as purgative. Harmala alkaloids from Banisteriopsis caapi have been used to treat Parkinson's disease. As a benzodiazepine site inverse agonist, harmala alkaloids are used as a model for essential tremor (ET) when injected to animals. Rats being treated with harmaline exhibit severe tremors after 5‚Äì7 minutes. Individuals diagnosed with essential tremor have been found to have elevated blood levels of harmala alkaloids. Unlike many synthetic pharmaceutical MAOIs such as phenelzine, harmine is reversible and selective meaning it does not have nearly as high a risk for the \\"cheese syndrome\\" caused by consuming tyramine- containing foods, which is a risk associated with monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, but not monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. Both MAO-A and MAO-B break down tyramine, but large doses of harmala alkaloids begin to affect MAO-B as well. = Anticancer = Isolated harmine was found to exhibit a cytotoxic effect on HL60 and K562 leukemic cell lines. This action might explain the previously observed cytotoxic effect of P. harmala on these cancer cells.\\" Legal status =Australia= Harmala alkaloids are considered Schedule 9 prohibited substances under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. Exceptions are made when in herbs, or preparations, for therapeutic use such as : (a) containing 0.1 per cent or less of harmala alkaloids; or (b) in divided preparations containing 2 mg or less of harmala alkaloids per recommended daily dose.

Hang Jebat Mausoleum in Malacca. Hang Jebat (Jawi: Ÿá⁄† ÿ¨Ÿäÿ®ÿ™) was the closest companion of the legendary Malaccan hero Hang Tuah. Regarded in Malaysia as one of the greatest silat exponents in history, he is well known for his vengeful rebellion against the Malacca Sultan whom he served. He can also be regarded as an early Malay anarchist following his rebellion against the ruler. Story After Hang Tuah was sentenced to death, Hang Jebat was conferred the coveted Taming Sari kris, a weapon formerly used by Hang Tuah. Believing that Hang Tuah was unjustly murdered by the sultan he served, Hang Jebat turned against the ruler to avenge his friend's death. No one knew that the bendahara (chief minister) went against the royal decree and hid Hang Tuah in a remote area. With the kris in his possession, Hang Jebat was undefeatable and there was not one person in the palace who was capable of killing him. Hang Jebat's revenge allegedly became a palace killing spree or furious rebellion against the sultan (sources differ as to what actually occurred). It remains consistent, however, that Hang Jebat wreaked havoc onto the royal court, and the sultan was unable to stop him, as none of the warriors dared to challenge the more ferocious and skilled Hang Jebat. After learning from the bendahara that Hang Tuah was still alive, the sultan had him recall the warrior and gave him full amnesty. The sultan then ordered Hang Tuah to kill Hang Jebat. Being unquestionably loyal to the ruler, Hang Tuah obeyed the sultan's bidding and went on to challenge Hang Jebat. After fighting in a battle that lasted for seven days, Hang Tuah eventually managed to reclaim the Taming Sari by tricking Hang Jebat. Although stabbed by Tuah, Hang Jebat bandaged his wounds and ran amok in the city square for three days, killing thousands of people before retreating to Tuah's house and dying in his friend's arms. Hang Jebat's famous quote during the fight was \\"Raja adil raja disembah, raja zalim raja disanggah\\" meaning \\"A fair king is a king saluted, a tyrant king is a king disputed.\\" This went against Tuah's philosophy of loyalty without question. After the fight, the sultan ordered his men to tear down, burn and throw the ashes of the house into the sea. Two months later, when a lady of the bendahara's retinue, Dang Wangi gave birth to Jebat's son, the sultan ordered Hang Tuah to throw the baby into the sea as well. Instead, the laksamana entrusted the child, Hang Nadim, to the bendahara. The child was then taken to Singapore where he was raised. Namesakes A Royal Malaysian Navy Lekiu class frigate is named after him: F29 KD Jebat. The recently decommissioned frigate F24 KD Rahmat was to be called KD Hang Jebat, but engine problems during builders trails caused the Royal Malaysian Navy to change her name to F24 KD Rahmat. One of the oldest engines that pulls the trains along the Singapore-Malaysia rail route is also named after him. In Singapore, there exists a minor road off Portsdown Avenue named \\"Jalan Hang Jebat\\" and a namesake mosque, Masjid Hang Jebat and the road's end.

Especially, NCL is the most powerful ligation method for synthesizing native backbone proteins or modified proteins of moderate size (i.e., small proteins< 200 AA).  Reaction  In native chemical ligation, the thiol group of an N-terminal cysteine residue of an unprotected peptide 2 attacks the C-terminal thioester of a second unprotected peptide 1 in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.0, 20 ¬∞C The reaction proceeded through the intermediacy of a thioester containing the sulfur of the cysteine residue. Wieland's work led to the 'active ester' method for making protected peptide segments in conventional solution synthesis in organic solvents. In the 1990s, Stephen Kent and coworkers at The Scripps Research Institute independently developed \\"Native Chemical Ligation\\", the first practical method to ligate large unprotected peptide fragments.  Properties  Native chemical ligation is carried out in aqueous solution and frequently gives near-quantitative yields of the desired ligation product. The challenge lies in the preparation of the necessary unprotected peptide- thioester building block. Peptide-thioesters are usually prepared by Boc chemistry SPPS; a thioester-containing peptide cannot be synthesized using a nucleophilic base, thus disfavoring Fmoc chemistry. Fmoc chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis techniques for generating peptide-thioesters are known; they make use of modifications of the Kenner 'safety catch' linker. In making peptide segments for use in native chemical ligation, protecting groups that release aldehydes or ketones should be avoided since these may cap the N-terminal cysteine. For the same reason, the use of acetone should be avoided, particularly prior to lyophilization and in washing glassware. A feature of the native chemical ligation technique is that the product polypeptide chain contains cysteine at the site of ligation. For some proteins, homocysteine can be used and methylated after ligation to form methionine, although side reactions can occur in this alkylation step. The cysteine at the ligation site can also be desulfurized to alanine; more recently, other beta-thiol containing aminoacids have been used for native chemical ligation, followed by desulfurization. Alternatively, thiol- containing ligation auxiliaries can be used that mimic an N-terminal cysteine for the ligation reaction, but which can be removed after synthesis. The use of thiol-containing auxiliaries is not as effective as ligation at a Cys residue. Native chemical ligation can also be performed with an N-terminal selenocysteine residue. The payoff in the native chemical ligation method is that coupling long peptides by this technique is in many cases nearly quantitative and provides synthetic access to large peptides and proteins otherwise impossible to make, due to length or decoration by post- translational modification. Native chemical ligation forms the basis of modern chemical protein synthesis, and has been used to prepare numerous proteins and enzymes by total chemical synthesis. Polypeptide C-terminal thioesters produced by recombinant DNA techniques can be reacted with an N-terminal Cys containing polypeptide by the same native ligation chemistry to provide very large semi-synthetic proteins. Native chemical ligation of this kind using a recombinant polypeptide segment is known as Expressed Protein Ligation. Similarly, a recombinant protein containing an N-terminal Cys can be reacted with a synthetic polypeptide thioester. Thus, native chemical ligation can be used to introduce chemically synthesized segments into recombinant proteins, regardless of size. Polypeptide C-terminal thioesters can also be produced in situ, using so-called N,S-acyl shift systems. Bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amido group, also called SEA group, belongs to this family. Polypeptide C-terminal bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amides (SEA peptide segments) react with Cys peptide to give a native peptide bond as in NCL. This reaction, which is called SEA Native Peptide Ligation, is a useful extension of Native Chemical Ligation.  Size limitation  NCL has been proven to be a convenient method for the chemical synthesis of proteins well over 100 amino acids in length, as demonstrated on the 166-amino-acid polypeptide chain of the synthetic variant of erythropoietin and the 203 amino acid HIV-1 protease.

It was also sold in North America initially through American Motors dealers as the Renault Medallion and later through Jeep-Eagle dealers as the Eagle Medallion. A total of 2,096,000 units were produced. The Renault 21 sedan was launched in the beginning of 1986, as the successor to the successful Renault 18, and this was followed a few months later by the seven seater station wagon, the R21 Nevada, marketed as the Savanna in the United Kingdom. In 1987, What Car? awarded the Renault 21 GTS Best Family Saloon. The Renault 21 Savanna was awarded Car of the Year, as well as Best Family Estate. Design 1993 Renault 21 GTX Nevada Rear view of Renault 21 1993 Renault 21 2.0 GTS Manager liftback Unusually, the Renault 21 was offered with disparate engine configurations. The 1.7 litre version featured a transverse engine and transmission, but Renault had no gearbox suitable for a more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured longitudinally mounted engines. The two versions featured (barely perceptibly) different wheel bases: the engines were all relatively compact four-cylinder units and the engine bay was large enough to accept either configuration without reducing passenger space. However, at a time when production technologies were relatively inflexible, the need to assemble differently configured engine bays on a single production line, along with the supplementary inventory requirements imposed both on Renault and on the dealership network, did compromise the Renault 21's profitability. The Nevada/Savanna station wagon/estate version was a little longer, with a 2750 mm (108.26 in) wheelbase, instead of the 2600 mm (102.6 in) of the sedan version, and configured with seven seats, two of those a forward facing foldable bench seat for children (up to about age 10) that used up much of the luggage space. It had roofrack side rails as standard. History First unveiled on 20 November 1985 and officially launched in February 1986, the R21 gave Renault a new competitor in this sector after eight years of the R18, which was declining in popularity after a very strong start to its commercial life. It had a razor like design, which was different from contemporary cars of the era, e.g. the Ford Sierra (with its \\"jelly mould\\" design) and the Opel Ascona (with its \\"J‚ÄìCar\\" design). It was sold in right hand drive for the United Kingdom from June 1986. The car was revamped considerably in May 1989, both technically and aesthetically ‚Äì the new sleeker outward appearance was similar to the also recently revamped Renault 25, and a liftback body style was also added to the range (which soon became more popular than the sedan in France) along with a sporty 2.0 L Turbo version. Of the sedans, the TXi 2.0 12v and 2.0 turbo was also available with the four-wheel-drive Quadra transmission. The Nevada wagons received four-wheel-drive in the eight-valve 2.0 and in the naturally aspirated 2.1 Diesel, as the 12-valve and the turbo were not available with this bodywork. The front-wheel-drive 21 Turbo was capable of .Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990, p. 840 At the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show the fuel injected 2.2i model was introduced, originally reserved for the German market (being a different model than the earlier 2.2s built for the US) where insurance and tax regulations suited larger engines with less peak power. Injected engines were equipped by Renix engine control unit, developed by a joint venture by Renault and Bendix. This car was also available with four-wheel-drive, exclusively as a Nevada. The Renault 21 liftback and sedan petrol fueled models ceased production in the beginning of 1994, following the launch of the all new Laguna liftback, but the diesels and the Nevada/Savanna remained on the market, until their replacement Laguna variants were launched (end of 1994 for the diesels, and end of 1995 for the Nevada/Savanna). A Renault 21 TSE, donated as a personal gift to V√°clav Havel by the president of Portugal M√°rio Soares just before the Velvet Revolution, served for a while as the official state car of the President of Czechoslovakia in 1989. Other markets =Argentina= The R21 was built in Argentina, at the Renault facility in Santa Isabel (C√≥rdoba Province) from late 1988 until early 1996. Production continued in Argentina for some years after its demise in European markets. Two body styles were built: sedan and Nevada (station wagon). It has been equipped with both petrol and diesel engines. The only petrol engine available was the 2.2 L 8 valve (carburetor for the early production, fuel injection for the later models), and the only diesel engine available was the 2.1 L. Both engines were available for the three body versions. The liftback was imported from France and called by the trim \\"Aliz√©\\". Was replaced for the Laguna. =Turkey= The R21 was manufactured in Turkey in the beginning of 1990s under the name Optima (entry model), Manager (1.7L 90 hp), and at the top of the line the 2.0-liter fuel injected \\"Concorde.\\" Later on, the \\"Manager 2000\\" with a 2 L 122 PS engine was introduced. The Oyak-built Renault 21 was produced and sold up to the end of 1996 in Turkey. =United States and Canada= The R21 was also sold in the United States and Canada from 1987 to 1988 as the Renault Medallion and later in 1988 until the end of the line in 1989 as the Eagle Medallion with the 2.2 L engine as the only powerplant. However, the car was only on sale for a few months in 1987 before Renault sold its investment in American Motors Corporation (AMC) to Chrysler. AMC dealers were now under the newly formed Jeep-Eagle Division of Chrysler, and now as Jeep-Eagle dealers, they continued to sell the car as the Eagle Medallion until 1989. The North American version had somewhat different styling to comply with front and rear impact regulations and different lighting standards. =Colombia= The 21 was launched in Colombia in 1987. Initially, it was available in four door body, with 2.0 L longitudinal engine. In October of the same year, the Renault 21 Nevada was launched, with the same engine as the saloon. in 1989 Sociedad de Fabricaci√≥n de Automotores S.A.

The bridge carries the two lanes of State Route 852 and Truck Route U.S. Highway 23. The bridge connects to Kentucky Route 8. History In July 1978, inspections of the original U.S. Grant Bridge found serious deterioration in its suspension cables. The bridge was closed to traffic and was rehabilitated over an 18-month period. With future traffic projected to increase compounded with a decline in level of service on the original U.S. Grant Bridge, the Kentucky Department of Transportation (KYDOT) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) agreed to begin planning for a new bridge. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act authorized the construction of a new bridge across the Ohio River in Portsmouth. In the environmental impact statement, it was decided the new bridge would be located downstream from the U.S. Grant Bridge. The bridge opened on January 28, 1988. It is named after the late Carl D. Perkins, Congressman from the 7th District of Kentucky. During the demolition of the original U.S. Grant Bridge and the construction of its replacement upstream, it was the only highway bridge connecting Ohio to Kentucky at Portsmouth.

Early years Carl Dewey Perkins was born in Hindman, Kentucky on October 15, 1912, to Dora Calhoun Perkins and James Perkins. Perkins attended high school at Hindman High School and Caney Junior College (now Alice Lloyd College). He worked as a teacher in a Knott County School for 90 students. He then went on to attend the Jefferson School of Law (now known as the University of Louisville School of Law) and graduated in 1935. He passed the bar and served a term as a commonwealth attorney for the thirty-first judicial district of Kentucky. In 1938 Perkins married Verna Johnson and they had one son, Carl C. Perkins. During World War II, Perkins enlisted in the United States Army and served a tour in Europe. In 1940, Perkins was elected as a member of the Kentucky General Assembly was then elected Knott County Attorney in 1941 and reelected in 1945. Perkins resigned January 1, 1948 so that he could counsel the Department of Highways for Frankfort, Kentucky. He was elected to serve as a Kentucky Representative in 1948 winning against the incumbent Wendell H. Meade.

Its population includes 184,269 inhabitants (2011), situated across the Tagus River estuary from Lisbon, in an area of that includes six parishes. Its seat is the city of Seixal a centre of 31,600 inhabitants situated along the Rio Judeu. The present Mayor is Joaquim Santos, elected by the Unitarian Democratic Coalition since September 2013. Seixal is known for being one of the few cities in Portugal governed by the communist party for more than 20 years. History Ecomuseu of Seixal, constructed from a river mill constructed during the 18th century A view inside a former cork factory in Seixal A view of traditional Pauliteiros from the Avante! Festival The toponymy Seixal comes from a type of smooth stone (seixo) that is found in rivers; the name evolving from the name used to describe the geomorphology of the region. Since the Roman era, the Tagus bay has been a region of human settlement, from many of the archaeological discoveries at Quinta do Rouxinol, in Corroios, and Quinta de S. Jo√£o, in Arrentela (beginning in the period of the Portuguese Age of Discovery). A land of fishermen and signeurial holdings, the municipality of Seixal evolved over the centuries, always with the connection to the river. It was across the Tagus that many of the region's products (fishe, cereals, salt, olive oil, wine and fruits) were exported to the regional capital. In the 15th century, due to its prime location, various dockyards and shipbuilders began constructing river boats and trans-Atlantic ships. At the same time, the tides of the region were used to develop mills, such as the tidal mill in Corroios in 1403, fostering various the millers, caulkers and carpenters along the river. It was in Seixal that the brothers Vasco da Gama and Paulo da Gama built vessels for the trip to India. While Vasco da Gama was in Lisbon to prepare the trip, Paulo da Gama commanded carpenters and caulkers in the construction of the ships. Estev√£o da Gama, the father of the brothers, was commander of Seixal. The construction of the ships was the beginning of what is known as the Portuguese Discoveries. The settlement at this time was actually a part of the parish of Arrentela, then a division of Almada. At the beginning of the 16th century, the population of the territory numbers three dozen homes, and by the 18th century there was a population of 400 inhabitants. After the Liberal revolution, during the administrative reforms of 1836, during the reign of Queen Maria II of Portugal, Seixal obtained the status of municipality. A few years later (1895), this status, was extinguished. At that time Amora was integrated into the municipality of Almada, while Arrentela, Aldeia de Paio Pires and Seixal was annexed into the municipality of Barreiro. Yet, three years later the municipality of Seixal was newly instituted. As a consequence, by the 18th century, the municipality became an aristocratic retreat for the nobility in nearby Lisbon, resulting in the construction several vacation properties or villas, such as Quinta da Fidalga, Quinta do Alamo, Quinta da Trindade, Quinta de S√£o Pedro and Quinta de Cheiraventos. Around the bay there are several factories that were important in the development of the municipality, such as the F√°brica de Vidros da Amora (Amora Glass Factory, the Companhia de Lanif√≠cios da Arrentela (Arrentela Wool Co.), the Mundet Cork Factory in Seixal; and the cod drying buildings on the Ponta dos Corvos. These early factory installations transformed the municipality from a rural outpost into an industrial centre, eventually resulting in the installation of the steelmaker Siderurgia Nacional in 1961. In 1966, a bridge was inaugurated over the Tagus providing a direct, stable link to Lisbon. The civil parish of Corroios was created in 1976. On 27 May 1993, the parish of Fern√£o Ferro was established, following the division of the old parish of Arrentela; and on 20 May, the towns of Seixal and Amora evolved to the status of city. Geography { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Seixal is situated on the peninsula of Set√∫bal and is part of the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The municipality is bordered to the east by the municipality of Barreiro, south by Sesimbra, west by Almada (with which it has a strong affinity) and the north by the Tagus estuary, through which connects to Lisbon. The Bay of Seixal is part of the Tagus River Estuary, that is fed by several rivers and confluents that extend to the sea; classified as a Reserva Ecol√≥gica Nacional (National Ecological Reserve), the bay and small tributaries are part of one of the most important humid zones in Portugal, supporting an elevated biodiversity and exceptional landscape. Seixal is one of the eight municipalities with the most inhabitants in Portugal, and is composed of four parishes occupying a territory of : * Amora * Corroios * Fern√£o Ferro * Seixal, Arrentela e Aldeia de Paio Pires Although the municipal population continued to grow with development, after the 1970s there was a boom in the population, due to improvements in accessibility and mobility, principally due to public transport, its location to Lisbon and installation of economic activities within the territory. This growth transformed, in a short time, from a territory predominantly rural into an urban municipality, consisting of agglomerations of large dimensions focusing on various establishments and social centres. This growth resulted in the 1993 elevation of Seixal and Amora into cities, and the establishment of Corroios into the status of town. Economy A view of the Tagus River estuary that supports the economic and social life of the municipality Seixal's industrial tradition dates to the shipbuilding industries during the Age of Discoveries. Its privileged location near the capital, with ease of access along the river, contributed to the establishment of various industries. By the early 1990s, heavy industry and manufacturing ceased to be an important motivator of the local economy, with the small and medium logistics and service industries established in modern industrial parks: there are roughly 15,000 companies. Approximately 556 hectares of the municipality (or 6.2% of the area) is occupied by economic activities, with the municipal planning authority adding an additional 364 hectares (3.8%) to industry. Two of the most recent investment catchment operations is Seixal Business Park, an area next to the Coina node where are headquartered 69 companies, representing about 1,500 jobs, and the study redefine the spatial organization of the area occupied by the former National Steel Company (Siderurgia National do Seixal). These two projects converge on the new Economic Activities Park Seixal County, an area with a total of 700 hectares. Another area of investment in the county is the tourism. With a wide river front and a large area of tree mass, there are numerous business activities with potential for tourism and leisure. The Office of Business Support - GAE (Gabinete de Apoio ao Empres√°rio), inserted into the GAE Network of Setubal, can support routing of investment through support provided by trained personnel. Here you can learn about business creation, licensing, support and investment incentives, camar√°rios requirements, suitable sites for the installation of economic activities and interpretation of PDM - Municipal Master Plan, as well as other information about the business. Transport The principal road network that crosses the municipality, guarantees the connections north to Almada and Lisbon, some away, in addition to Set√∫bal, including the A2 motorway. The A33 motorway also constitutes a vital variant along the Set√∫bal peninsula, allowing connection along two bridges over the Tagus, and facilitate inter-municipal commerce. The rail-lines connecting Lisbon to Fogueteiro, across the 25 April Bridge (), reinforces these roadway connections. Inland navigation across the Tagus estuary is a vital link economically, as well as a tourist link, with catamaran service provided by Transtejo & Soflusa (with 15 minute service) to Cais do Sodr√© in Lisbon. A lowland community, Seixal provides bike paths along the bay that link Amora and Seixal, passing through the parishes of Seixal, Arrentela and Amora. Culture A pan across the celebrants of the 2001 Avante! Festival Throughout there are secular or religious celebrations that highlight the calendar year, including the Modern Music Festival of Corroios and Seixal Jazz. But, the primary event of the social year is the Avante! Festival, the annual festival of Portuguese Communist Party, that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors. The event consists of a three-day music festival with hundreds of Portuguese and international bands and artists across five different stages, in addition to ethnographic demonstrations, gastronomy, social debates, books and music fair, the Avanteatro (theatre) and sporting events. Several foreign communist parties also participate. The events preparation begins following the conclusion of the annual festivities, through the initiative of party members and youth volunteers. Sport Seixal√≠ada is the community's annual sporting event bringing together the region's athletes in various sporting activities from track to water event, forming a mini-Olympiad.

His work, the New York Times wrote,\\"figured in the development of an American sculptural art that balanced nature and abstraction.\\" Widely exhibited, he took part in the Whitney's 1946 exhibition Pioneers of Modern Art. Credited as the first American sculptor to adopt a \\"direct carving\\" sculpting style that was bolder and more abstract than the then traditional fine arts practice, which relied on models, Laurent's approach was inspired by the African carving and European avant-garde art he admired, while also echoing folk styles found both in the U.S. and among medieval stone cutters of his native Brittany. Best known for his virtuoso mastery of the figure, Laurent sculpted in multiple media, including wood, alabaster, bronze, marble and aluminum. His expertise earned him major commissions for public sculpture, most famously for the Goose Girl for New York City's Radio City Music Hall, as well as for Spanning the Continent for Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. After the Depression, he was also the recipient of several Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Art Project commissions under the New Deal, including a bas-relief called Shipping for the exterior of Washington, D.C.'s Federal Trade Commission Building, commissioned by the Treasury Department‚Äôs Section of Fine Arts in 1938.  Background  Laurent was born the son of French peasants in Concarneau, Brittany, France in 1890. His skill in art was recognized by Brooklyn Eagle art critic, painter and collector Hamilton Easter Field who mentored him, taught him to paint and served as Laurent's surrogate father for the rest of his life. In 1908, Field took Laurent to Rome, where he trained with Maurice Sterne and wood carver Giuseppe Doratori,Proske, Beatrice Gilman, Brookgreen Gardens Sculpture, Brookgreen Gardens, SC, 1943 p413 before formally studying at the British Academy. Upon graduation, Laurent moved permanently to the U.S. at age twenty, only to quickly return to Europe as a member of the navy during the First World War.Armstrong, Craven et al, ‚Äò‚Äô200 Years of American Sculpture‚Äô‚Äô, David R. Godine, Publisher in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1976, p 286 In Europe, Laurent traveled to his native Brittany where he met Mimi Caraes, who became his wife. Field died in 1922, leaving Laurent his Brooklyn home, the Ogunquit school they had co- founded and an art collection, which Laurent later used to establish as the Hamilton Easter Field Foundation with the help of other New York artists.  The Ogunquit Summer School of Graphic Arts  In the summer of 1902, Field and 12-year-old Laurent traveled to Ogunquit, Maine, a popular destination for artists, drawn by the landscape. During their stay, Field \\"bought a row of shacks that he started renting out cheap to artists.\\" In 1911, Field and Laurent built a studio there and co-founded the Ogunquit Summer School of Graphic Arts. Field taught drawing and painting until his death, and Laurent taught sculpture and wood carving there for the next 50 years. There was, however, another art school in Ogunquit. Founded by Field's former teacher, Charles Woodbury's Ogunquit Summer School of Drawing and Painting was heavily influenced by the \\"regional impressionist\\" style of painting also known as the Boston School. One of the school's more famous students was Edward Hopper. Field and Laurent were, conversely, committed modernists, and appealed to more experimental students and colleagues, such as Marsden Hartley, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Niles Spencer, gallery owner Edith Gregor Halpert and curator Holger Cahill, among others. Together, the two schools transformed a town of fewer than 1,000 into Maine's largest art colony, an achievement that resulted, in 1953, in the opening of the Ogunquit Museum of American Art.  Public collections  Public collections across the United States hold Laurent's work, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MOMA, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Addison Gallery, Indiana University and the Terra Foundation for Art, among others.  Awards and honors  Robert Laurent, Polynesian, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Museum purchase, 1975.4.3 In 1938, Laurent won the second of two Logan Prizes at the Art Institute of Chicago's annual American art exhibition. In 1945, he won the Audubon Sculpture Award in New York, several first prizes in Hoosier salons, and in exhibits at the John Herron Museum, Indianapolis. He received high distinction in 1954 when was named sculptor in residence at the American Academy in Rome for a year. Laurent was also one of 23 American sculptors whose works were selected for the controversial American National Exhibition in Moscow, in 1959. The exhibit, which included such celebrated artists as sculptors Ibram Lassaw and Isamu Noguchi and painters Hyman Bloom, Jackson Pollock and Edward Hopper was coordinated by the United States Information Agency (USIA), and liberal critics subsequently characterized it as a Cold War American \\"propaganda strategy.\\" Prior to the exhibition, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) threatened to remove many of the artists who had been accused of links to communist activities. After President Eisenhower intervened, however, the exhibition went on as planned. Laurent was a fellow of the National Sculpture Society, president of the Hamilton Easter Field Foundation, and a member of the Sculptor's Guild ‚Äì Indiana Artists, New England Sculptors Association, and the College Art Association. He was also elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters shortly before his death at the age of seventy-nine. left  Academic career  Laurent taught at the Art Students League in New York City, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., Vassar College, and Goucher College. In addition to teaching seasonally at the Ogunquit School until 1961, Laurent accepted a position as Professor of Fine Arts at Indiana University, a position he held from 1942 to 1960.

The Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus associates the term \\"lapsed Catholic\\" as one who is backsliding. Lapsing is thus not necessarily connected with a lack of belief.Leslie John Francis, William K. Kay, William S. Campbell (editors), Research in Religious Education (Gracewing Publishing 1996 ), p. 378 However, author Daniel Ford links being a lapsed Catholic with rejection of Catholic teaching, either totally or by being an \\"√† la carte Catholic\\".Quotes from Daniel F. Ford, The Lapsed Catholic Catechism: \\"Lapsees are √† la carte Catholics who pick and choose what suits them, if anything does, from the long menu of past teachings from Rome and/or other religious traditions. Some even continue to participate in orthodox Catholic rituals ‚Äì e.g., getting married in church and attending the church funeral rites intended to honor the departed and comfort the family and friends left behind. Some Lapsed Catholics are out and out atheists or agnostics. They look at arguments about God's existence as W.H. Auden did: 'All proofs or disproofs that we tender are returned Unopened to the sender.' The actor Martin Sheen has described himself as 'one of those cliff-hanging Catholics. I don't believe in God, but I do believe that Mary was his mother.'\\" Other sources associate the term with abandonment of practice of the Catholic religion rather than with rejection of its doctrine. Thus the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary defines \\"lapsed\\", again in relation to \\"lapsed Catholic\\", as \\"no longer involved in an activity or organization\\", and the Oxford Dictionary speaks only of \\"no longer following the rules and practices of a religion or doctrine\\". Richard John Neuhaus distinguished between Catholic and Protestant ideas of what it means to be \\"lapsed\\" by quoting G.K. Chesterton, who remarked that a Protestant typically says he is a good Protestant, while a Catholic typically says he is a bad Catholic. For many, being a lapsed Catholic is just another way of being a Catholic.Neuhaus, Richard John. Catholic Matters (Basic Books 2007 ), p. 10 Catholic teaching on membership in the Church According to Catholic belief, baptism \\"seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark of belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation.\\" Even the form of censure known as excommunication does not in itself make a person an ex-Catholic in the eyes of the Church: excommunicated persons are \\"cut off from the Church\\", barred from receiving the Eucharist and from taking an active part in the liturgy (reading, serving at the altar, etc.), but they remain Catholics according to Church doctrine.\\"Even those who have joined another religion, have become atheists or agnostics, or have been excommunicated remain Catholics. Excommunicates lose rights, such as the right to the sacraments, but they are still bound to the obligations of the law; their rights are restored when they are reconciled through the remission of the penalty.\\" New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, ed. by John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 63 (commentary on canon 11). They are urged to retain a relationship with the Church, as its goal is to encourage them to repent and return to active participation in its life.  History  In the time of the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, many Christians, including clergy and even some bishops, were referred to as the lapsi (those who had slipped and fell) as opposed to the stantes (those who stood firm).Carl Sommer, We Look for a Kingdom (Ignatius Press 2007 ), p. 248 Frances Margaret Young, Margaret Mary Mitchell, K. Scott Bowie (editors), The Cambridge History of Christianity'' (Cambridge University Press 2006 ), p. 389 Different attitudes developed within the Church towards the lapsed: some held they should never be readmitted to the Church before death, others were for demanding serious penance of them before readmitting them, while others again were still more lenient.James B. North, Don Umphrey, A History of the Church (College Press 1991 ), pp. 62-63 The First Council of Nicaea insisted that any clergy who had lapsed were not to be readmitted to clerical rank. From 1983 a formal act of defection from the Catholic Church was recognised in the Code of Canon Law, making defectors ineligible for the privileges of membership of the Church, such as marrying in church. This form of defection was removed from the Code in 2009, and it was no longer possible to defect formally from the Catholic Church.Statement on Formal Defections In the religion question on the Republic of Ireland census, \\"lapsed (Roman) Catholic\\" (a write-in option rather than a pre-printed checkbox option) was collated separately for the first time in 2011, when 1,268 were recorded (0.033% of the \\"Roman Catholic\\" total); the 2016 census recorded 8,094 (0.21%).  Present canon law  Today, a Catholic who lapses to the extent of becoming an apostate, a heretic or a schismatic is automatically excommunicated, and, until the excommunication is lifted, is forbidden to have any ministerial part in the celebration of Mass or other worship ceremonies, to celebrate or receive the sacraments or to exercise any Church functions. This is an obligation that binds the excommunicated person. Unless the excommunication has been publicly declared by the Church and not merely incurred automatically, the excommunicated person cannot on that ground alone be publicly refused the sacraments, even by a priest who knows of it. However, to assist at the marriage of someone who has \\"notoriously\\" (i.e. widely known to have done so) rejected the Catholic faith, a priest needs the permission of the ordinary and the same promises required by spouses in mixed marriages are also required.John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas Joseph Green, New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law (Paulist Press 2002 ), p. 1269 The Code of Canon Law lays down no particular penalty for a lapsing that consists of failure to fulfill the obligations to attend Sunday Mass and to receive Communion during Eastertide. Colloquial names Some lapsed Catholics attend Mass on special occasions like Christmas and Easter. Such lapsed Catholics are colloquially referred to by such terms as Cultural Catholics, Convenient Catholics, Submarine Catholics, Two-Timers (for attending Mass twice a year), Chreasters (a portmanteau of Christmas and Easter), C&E; Catholics, Poinsettia & Lily Catholics, CEOs (\\"Christmas and Easter Only\\"), APEC, CAPE or PACE Catholics (Palm [Sunday], Ash [Wednesday], Christmas, Easter), CASE Catholics (\\"Christmas and Sometimes Easter\\"), CMEs (Christmas, Mother's Day and Easter), or A&P; Catholics (for Ash Wednesday and Palm Sunday). \\"Cultural Catholic\\" is also used to refer to a non-religious member of a historically Catholic ethnic group, such as Austrian, Belgian, Bavarian, French, French Canadian, Filipino, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Poles,GUS, Narodowy Spis Powszechny Ludnosci 2011: 4.4.

It served as a vehicle for Lyndon LaRouche to run for President of the United States in 1976, but it also sponsored many candidates for local offices and Congressional and Senate seats between 1972 and 1979. After that the political arm of the NCLC was the National Democratic Policy Committee. The party was the subject of a number of controversies and lawsuits during its short existence.  Party objectives and ideology At first the party was leftist, \\"preaching Marxist revolution.\\"Reich, Kenneth (September 21, 1977). \\"Tiny U.S. Labor Party Seeks Allies on the Right\\". Los Angeles Times, page A3. A state leader described the aims of the party and its organ, New Solidarity, as supporting the working class against capitalism, Nelson Rockefeller, and Leonard Woodcock, head of the United Auto Workers. The USLP predicted collapse of the monetary system by November 1976 and thermonuclear war by 1977. It opposed the Rockefeller family and had a reputation for harassing the Communist Party, the United Auto Workers, and other political foes. In a 1974 interview, the USLP candidate for Governor of Michigan characterized the Watergate scandal as a \\"deliberate attempt\\" to discredit Richard Nixon and weaken the presidency. By 1977 the party had shifted from the left to politics of the extreme right.  History  =1972-1976= The U.S. Labor Party was noted for its controversial campaign tactics, and its invective against other politicians. Nelson Rockefeller, the former Governor of New York who was nominated to be vice president by Gerald Ford in 1974, was an early target of the USLP's attention. During the Senate's confirmation hearings, LaRouche appeared on behalf of the USLP as a witness against Rockefeller's nomination. He testified that a USLP survey showed 90 percent of U.S. workers and the unemployed hated Rockefeller. In 1974 the Wisconsin branch of the Labor Party took out a newspaper advertisement announcing that it had filed for an injunction to prevent the CIA, FBI, and the New York Police Department from arresting Lyndon LaRouche (then known as Lyn Marcus) or anyone involved in the movement's kidnapping of Christopher White, who had married LaRouche's former common-law wife. According to detailed descriptions by LaRouche, White had been brainwashed by the CIA and KGB to kill him. The advertisement further reported that the movement had found a cure for psychosis and encouraged mental health professionals to contact them to develop this discovery. USLP member Harley Schlanger, a candidate for the House of Representatives, sued the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, ABC liquor board in August 1976, for prohibiting campaigning on their property, which he contended was public property. The North Carolina ACLU joined the suit. The district court judge decided that the activity was protected free speech that could not be prohibited so long as activists did not block doorways. One of the U.S. Labor Party's strategies focused on disrupting other left-wing groups, with questionable success. William Chapman wrote in The Washington Post in September 1976 that several public figures on the left had reported threats and intimidation, and said those responsible had identified themselves as members of LaRouche's NCLC or U.S. Labor Party. The linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky was accused of working for the CIA and being a tool of the Rockefellers; meetings he addressed were disrupted, and threats were made. The philosopher Paul Kurtz, editor of The Humanist, was asked during his lectures at the State University of New York why he was practicing genocide. According to Chapman, sociologists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, specialists on urban poverty, were followed around the country having their speaking tours disrupted. Environmentalist Lester Brown was accused of genocide and told he would be hanged from a lamppost. LaRouche was asked how he expected a party with a five-year record of harassment and threats to win the election; he did not deny the incidents, but replied, \\"We are only engaged in an open political attack. We just want to challenge them in debate.\\" He denied however that anyone had been threatened with physical harm: \\"Sure, we're going to get them ‚Äì but politically.\\"Chapman, September 12, 1976. The U.S. Labor Party was well financed, operating from the top floor of a building in New York's garment district. A teletype network connected the New York office to branches in a further 13 U.S. cities, and also included a two-way, 24-hour link to Wiesbaden, Germany. Membership was small, ranging from 20 to 100 people per city, with a core of 1,000 to 1,800 members; according to LaRouche, these were complemented by another 13,000 part-time party organizers. LaRouche said the party was funded by members' dues, other small contributions, and the sale of publications like The Campaigner and New Solidarity ‚Äì one a theoretical journal, the other a twice-weekly newspaper. The party fielded candidates in local and congressional elections, generally garnering only insignificant percentages of the popular vote; but there were exceptions ‚Äì in Seattle, a Labor Party member running for the city council won 27 percent of the vote, with another candidate who ran for city treasurer garnering 20 percent. =Presidential campaign= In an appearance on Meet the Press with other minor party candidates in October 1976, LaRouche predicted monetary collapse followed by thermonuclear war before summer if Jimmy Carter were elected. LaRouche also described Carter as \\"a nitwit to begin with, an empty slop jar into which bad lemonade is being poured.\\" However, conservative Republicans like President Ford fared better, incongruously so, given the Labor Party's stated left-wing stance. \\"I call them honest Americans\\", LaRouche said. He described Ford as \\"weak but well-meaning\\" and \\"a known quantity we can live with\\". On November 1, the eve of the election, the USLP purchased a half-hour block of time on NBC, the first of many national broadcasts by LaRouche that would follow in election years to come. The time was purchased over the objection of the network which unsuccessfully appealed the last-minute purchase to the Federal Election Commission. During the broadcast, which ran opposite a similar advertisement from Carter on another network, LaRouche said that Carter would have the U.S \\"irreversibly committed to nuclear war by no later than November of 1977\\" if elected. According to LaRouche's autobiography, he NBC reported receiving hundreds of calls protesting the broadcast. LaRouche's name was on the ballot in 23 states plus the District of Columbia on November 2, 1976. He received 40,043 votes (0.05%). U.S. Labor Party candidates sometimes received unusually high vote totals in comparison with those garnered by other small ideologically-based parties.King, Dennis. \\"NCLC Makes Election Inroads.\\" Our Town (part 6 in a 12-part series, 1979‚Äì1980) Following the election, the USLP brought lawsuits in three states challenging Carter's victory. The Republican Party joined the suits in Ohio and New York. Regional coordinator Paul Greenberg sought a recount in Milwaukee, saying \\"the election has actually been stolen ‚Äî the actual winner was probably Jerry Ford.\\" For more information on LaRouche's 1976 presidential campaign and the movement's legal disputes with the FEC, see Lyndon LaRouche U.S. Presidential campaigns. =1977-1982= In August 1977, the USLP said that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) was intentionally harassing the group as a result of a determination that forgiven debts were the equivalent of campaign contributions. The same month the USLP hired a former OSS and CIA operative, mercenary, firearms engineer and arms dealer, Colonel Mitch WerBell, to protect LaRouche. They said that LaRouche, then living in Wiesbaden, Germany, was being targeted for assassination by the \\"Baader-Meinhof Gang\\", allegedly on behalf of the Carter administration. Werbell in turn recruited the chief of police from his town, Powder Springs, Georgia, to set up the security. In 1978, LaRouche began a vigorous USLP campaign for the presidency in 1980, targeting farmers, small businessmen and Teamsters Union members in the Heartland states. In May 1978, USLP Steering Committee member Elliott Eisenberg campaigned in a Chicago suburb, saying that \\"the reason we picked Schaumburg is because it's a relatively conservative area ... There's more of a tendency for people to support nuclear power.\\" The USLP vice-presidential candidate, Khushro Ghandhi, campaigned in June 1979 and predicted victory based on support from the Teamsters (a faction of the union had ties to LaRouche). Running on a pro-nuclear power platform, Ghandhi said that the recent Three Mile Island accident was ordered by Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger in order to create a false energy crisis. By late summer of 1979 the NCLC and LaRouche had decided to join the Democratic Party so that LaRouche could run for that party's presidential nomination, and the U.S. Labor Party was disbanded. In 1982 the USLP was sued for $1.5 million in damages by U.S. News & World Report when one of its employees allegedly impersonated a reporter.\\"Magazine Sues U.S. Labor Party Over Impersonation Of A Reporter\\" AP. New York Times. New York, N.Y.: August 20, 1982. pg. D.16 The magazine won an injunction against the party publications. Lyndon LaRouche, when asked about the matter, said, \\"I don't know anything about it and I never looked into it, but I do know that the liberal press uses undercover press practices that are abhorrent and beneath description.\\" =Far-right contacts= The U.S. Labor Party had contacts with several notable figures on the extreme right wing of American politics. By the late 1970s, members were exchanging almost daily information with Roy Frankhouser, a government informant and infiltrator of both far right and far left groups who was involved with the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party..Blum, October 7, 1979, , and , p. 63. The LaRouche organization believed Frankhouser to be a federal agent who had been assigned to infiltrate right-wing and left-wing groups, and that he had evidence that these groups were actually being manipulated or controlled by the FBI and other agencies.EIR, July 17, 1975\\"The Busing Plot: CIA Plans Fall Race Riots, Organizes Both Sides\\", EIR, July 8, 1974 LaRouche and his associates considered Frankhouser to be a valuable intelligence contact, and took his links to racist and anti-Semitic groups to be a cover for his intelligence work., , Blum, October 7, 1979. Frankhouser played into these expectations, misrepresenting himself as a conduit for communications to LaRouche from \\"Mr. Ed\\", an alleged CIA contact, who did not exist., . Frankhouser was convicted in 1975 of conspiring to sell half a ton of dynamite in connection with a school bus bombing that left one man dead, and had marched on Fifth Avenue in New York wearing a Gestapo uniform. LaRouche had organized his defense campaign regarding the dynamite charges. Frankhouser asserted he was working for the government and was sentenced to five years of probation instead of the decades in prison he could have received.; Frankhouser warned LaRouche in 1977 that, according to his claimed CIA contact \\"Mr. Ed\\", he was being considered for assassination, and introduced him to Mitchell WerBell III, a noted Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative, mercenary, operator of a counterterrorism school, accused drug trafficker, firearms engineer, and arms dealer who said he had an ongoing connection to the CIA. LaRouche developed close ties with WerBell, hiring him as a security consultant for protection against the assumed assassination threat and to train his security staff.LaRouche in Dope, Inc., 1986, p. 549 It was WerBell who arranged for LaRouche movement members to undergo anti-terrorist training. John George and Laird Wilcox say WerBell learned that the way to keep \\"LaRouche on the hook was to feed his monstrous ego while jerking his paranoia chain\\". Frankhouser cultivated a contact with a media source in New York, enabling him to tip off LaRouche about upcoming stories before they became public. In 1979, Frankhouser was also placed on the payroll as a security consultant, having convinced LaRouche that he was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies. A government official later said that Frankhouser was one of the few people who could call LaRouche directly. Forrest Lee Fick, an associate of Frankhouser from the KKK, was added as a consultant in 1982. Fick helped Frankhouser, who was not a competent writer, to compose the memos from \\"Mr. Ed\\"; they appeared so authentic that when news about them began to leak out via defectors from LaRouche's security organization, journalists began to speculate about the identity of \\"Mr. Ed\\". Frankhouser and Fick later testified that, to justify their $700-per-week paychecks, they had invented their connections to the CIA, written memos purporting to be from CIA agents, and warned of imaginary assassination plots against the LaRouches.Mintz, December 18, 1987; Wald 1987. George and Wilcox called Frankhouser's deception \\"one of the biggest hoaxes in the annals of political extremism\\", made possible by what they called LaRouche's \\"obsession with conspiracy theories\\" and intelligence gathering. The USLP also had brief contact with the Liberty Lobby led by Willis Carto. Carto had some exploratory talks with LaRouche about a joint strategy against the IRS, but the contact was marked by much mutual suspicion. Carto was troubled by the number of Jews in the U.S. Labor Party, and by their adherence to basic socialist positions, including their support for central banking, while Labor Party members considered people in the Liberty Lobby \\"red-necks\\" and \\"idiots\\".. Criticism In 1979, a two-part article by Howard Blum and Paul L. Montgomery appeared in the New York Times that accused LaRouche of running a cult.; Blum wrote that LaRouche had turned the U.S. Labor Party--with 1,000 members listed in 37 offices in North America, and 26 in Europe and Latin America--into an extreme-right, anti- Semitic organization, despite the presence of Jewish members. The Times alleged that members had taken courses in how to use knives and rifles, and had produced reports for South Africa on anti-apartheid groups in the United States. A farm in upstate New York was allegedly being used for guerrilla training, attended by LaRouche members from Germany and Mexico. Several members also underwent a six-day anti-terrorist training course, at a cost of $200 per person per day, at a camp in Powder Springs, Georgia, run by WerBell. The Times reported that U.S. Labor Party members were playing a dominant role in a number of companies in Manhattan: Computron Technologies Corporation, which included Mobil Oil and Citibank among its clients; World Composition Services, which the Times wrote had one of the most advanced typesetting complexes in the city and had the Ford Foundation among its clients; and PMR Associates, a printing shop that produced the party's publications and some high school newspapers (see below). Blum wrote that, from 1976 onwards, party members were transmitting intelligence reports on left-wing members to the FBI and local police. In 1977, he wrote, commercial reports on U.S. anti-apartheid groups were prepared by LaRouche members for the South African government, student dissidents were reported to the Shah of Iran's Savak secret police, and the anti-nuclear movement was investigated on behalf of power companies. He also wrote that LaRouche was telling his membership several times a year that he was being targeted for assassination, including by the Queen, \\"big- time Zionist mobsters,\\" the Council on Foreign Relations, the Justice Department, and the Mossad. LaRouche denied the newspaper's charges, and said he had filed a $100 million libel suit. His press secretary said the series was intended \\"to set up a credible climate for an assassination hit\\". The USLP has also been called a \\"radical and cult-like group\\". Milton Copulos of the Heritage Foundation described the USLP as \\"a virulently anti-Semitic outgrowth of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)\\" which used the Fusion Energy Foundation as a front to \\"win the confidence of unsuspecting businessmen\\". Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote that the USLP began \\"on the political left but has since gone so far in the opposite direction that to call it politically right is to slander the entire conservative movement\\". Labor-union journalist Victor Riesel, while writing of \\"anti-capitalistic movements, ranging all the way from the Communist Party U.S.A. to the Trotskyite Socialist Workers' Party\\", said in 1976 \\"the most extreme activists in this sprawling radicalism are the youthful U.S. Labor Party\\". Civil Rights activist Julian Bond called the party \\"a group of leftwing fascists\\". LaRouche critic and biographer Dennis King says that when the USLP sponsored LaRouche's 1976 campaign, the NCLC was still in transition from a far-left to far-right ideology but by 1977-1978 both organizations (which were really one and the same for all essential purposes) were advocating extreme-right positions. King described a typical post-transition USLP campaign in Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism (Doubleday, 1989): > In Baltimore, USLP candidate Debra Freeman appealed openly to racist and > anti-Semitic sentiments in her 1978 campaign against incumbent Congressman > Parren Mitchell, chairman of the Black Congressional Caucus. Freeman, who is > white, described Mitchell as a 'house nigger' for Baltimore's 'Zionists' and > an example of 'bestiality' in politics....She won more than 11 percent of > the vote, doing especially well in several white precincts. King, Dennis. > Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism (Doubleday, 1989) The NCLC had used similar language as early as 1974, when an alderman in Madison, Wisconsin, was called a \\"house nigger\\" at a city-council meeting. According to Dennis King, the USLP chairman advocated launching ABC (atomic, biological and chemical) warfare against the Soviet UnionKing, Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism, New York: Doubleday, 1989, p. 56 as well as the military crushing of Britain (which his newspaper described as the headquarters of the \\"Zionist-British organism\\").

She was the first actress to play the part. The films in which she played Miss Moneypenny were Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Live and Let Die (1973), The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983), and A View to a Kill (1985). She did not appear in the 1954 and 1967 adaptations of Casino Royale, nor in the 1983 remake of Thunderball, Never Say Never Again, as the production was not Eon's, though she did, as a similar character, in the spoof O.K. Connery. She began her film career in the late 1940s, and won the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer for her performance in That Hagen Girl (1947). Following a number of small film roles, she became dissatisfied and travelled to Italy, where she worked in film from 1951 to 1955. After her marriage she moved to the United Kingdom, where she appeared in several television productions. As Maxwell's career declined, she lived in Canada, Switzerland, and the UK. In 2001, she was diagnosed with bowel cancer and moved to Western Australia, where she lived with her son until her death, aged 80, in 2007. Life and career =Early life= Maxwell was born in Kitchener, Ontario, to a nurse mother, Ruth Adelaide Wells, and a teacher father, William Victor Hooker. https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hooker-1948 Maxwell was raised in Toronto and attended Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute. Dissatisfied with the yields of babysitting jobs, she set her sights on something more lucrative and landed her first job working as a waitress at Canada's largest and most luxurious summer resort, Bigwin Inn, on Bigwin Island in Lake of Bays, Ontario. During World War II she ran away from home, aged 15, to join the Canadian Women's Army Corps, a unit formed to release men for combat duties. CWAC personnel were secretaries, vehicle drivers, and mechanics, who performed every conceivable noncombat duty. Maxwell quickly became part of the Army Show in Canada. Later, as part of the Canadian Auxiliary Services Entertainment Unit, she was posted to the United Kingdom, where she performed music and dance numbers to entertain the troops, often appearing alongside Canadian comedians Wayne and Shuster. Maxwell's true age was discovered when the group reached London. To avoid her being repatriated to Canada, she was discharged; she subsequently enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where she became friends with fellow student Roger Moore. Moore was later her on-screen colleague, in the James Bond film series, from Live and Let Die (1973) to A View to a Kill (1985). =Career= Moving to Hollywood at the age of 20, Maxwell won the actress Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer for her role in the Shirley Temple drama That Hagen Girl (1947). In 1949, she participated in a Life magazine photo layout, in which she posed with another up-and-coming actress, Marilyn Monroe. It was at this time that she changed her surname from Hooker to Maxwell, a name borrowed from a ballet dancer friend. The rest of her family also took this name.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, reprinted in The Age, 3 October 2007, Businessday, p. 13. Most of Maxwell's work consisted of minor roles in B films. Tiring of Hollywood, she moved back to Europe, living in Rome for five years (1950‚Äì1955). There she made a series of films, and at one point became an amateur race driver. One of her Italian films was an adaptation of the opera Aida (1953), in which Maxwell played a leading role, lip-synching to another woman's vocals and appearing in several scenes with the still unknown Sophia Loren. While visiting Paris, she met her future husband, TV executive Peter Marriott. They married in 1957 and moved to London, where their daughter Melinda and son Christian were both born (in 1958 and 1959). Maxwell appeared with Patrick McGoohan in the British television series Danger Man as his accomplice in the 1959 episode \\"Position of Trust\\". During the 1960s Maxwell appeared in many TV series and in films outside the Bond series, in both the UK and Canada. She guest-starred in two episodes of The Saint and later in one episode of The Persuaders!, in both of which she appeared alongside the future James Bond, Roger Moore. She provided the voice of Atlanta for the Supermarionation science-fiction children's series Stingray and was the star of the CBC series Adventures in Rainbow Country in the 1970s. Maxwell had a minor role as a nurse in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962). In 1963 Maxwell played a machine gun-firing nurse in the series The Avengers (episode \\"The Little Wonders\\", which was first aired on 11 January 1964). She had a guest appearance in an episode of the ITC series The Baron (\\"Something for a Rainy Day\\", 1965), as an insurance investigator. Role as Miss Moneypenny Maxwell lobbied for a role in the James Bond film Dr. No (1962), for her husband had suffered a heart attack and they needed the money. Director Terence Young, who had once turned her down on the grounds that she \\"looked like she smelled of soap\\", offered her either Miss Moneypenny or Bond's girlfriend, Sylvia Trench, but she was uncomfortable with the idea of a revealing scene outlined in the screenplay. The role as M's secretary guaranteed just two days' work at a rate of ¬£100 per day; Maxwell supplied her own clothes for the filming. Maxwell appeared in the Italian spy spoof Operation Kid Brother in 1967, with Bernard Lee (who played M) and Sean Connery's brother Neil. In the same year she portrayed Moneypenny in a made- for-TV special, Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond, in which she co-starred with Kate O'Mara and Desmond Llewelyn. In 1971, the role of Moneypenny was nearly recast after Maxwell demanded a pay raise for Diamonds Are Forever. However, the producers felt it important to incorporate the regular character, and it was ultimately decided during production to add the scene where, disguised as a customs officer, she gives Bond his travel documents at the Port of Dover. Maxwell and Sean Connery filmed their lines separately and were not present together for the short scene.Chapman, James, Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films (Cinema and Society). I. B. Taurus Books, 2008. pp. 101‚Äì102 D'Abo, Maryam & Cork, John, Bond Girls are Forever: The Women of James Bond. Harry N. Abrams Books, 2003. p. 87 Moneypenny's undercover policewoman's cap disguises the hair Maxwell had already dyed in preparation for another part. Maxwell stayed on as Moneypenny when her former classmate Roger Moore assumed the role of 007 in Live and Let Die (1973). She reprised her character, weeping for the death of Bond, in a short scene with Lee in the French comedy Bons baisers de Hong Kong (1975). During the filming of A View to a Kill (1985), her final appearance as Moneypenny, producer Cubby Broccoli pointed out to her that they were the only cast or crew members from Dr. No who had not yet left the series. Maxwell asked that Moneypenny be killed off, but Broccoli recast the role instead. According to author Tom Lisanti, Maxwell's Moneypenny was seen as an \\"anchor\\", and her flirtatious relationship with Bond provided the films with dramatic realism and humanism; for Moneypenny, Bond was \\"unobtainable\\", freeing the characters to make outrageous sexual double entendres. =Later life= Maxwell's husband died in 1973, having never fully recovered from his heart attack in the 1960s. Maxwell subsequently returned to Canada, settling in Fort Erie, Ontario, where she lived on Oakes Drive. She spent her summers at a cottage outside Espanola, Ontario, where she wrote a weekly column for the Toronto Sun under the pseudonym \\"Miss Moneypenny\\" from 1979 until 1994, and became a businesswoman working in the textile industry. In 1994, she returned to the UK once again to be nearer to her daughter Daphne, retiring to a cottage in Frome, Somerset. A plaque has been placed on her home there by the Frome Society of Local Study. Death Following surgery for bowel cancer in 2001, Maxwell moved to Perth, Western Australia, to live with her son Christian's family. She remained there, working on her autobiography, until her death at Fremantle Hospital on 29 September 2007. Of his friend's death, Sir Roger Moore said to BBC Radio 5 Live, \\"It's rather a shock. She was always fun and she was wonderful to be with and was absolutely perfect casting [...] It was a great pity that, after I moved out of Bond, they didn't take her on to continue in the Timothy Dalton films. I think it was a great disappointment to her that she had not been promoted to play M. She would have been a wonderful M.\\" Partial filmography * A Matter of Life and Death (1946) as Actress (uncredited) * Spring Song (1946) as Penelope Cobb (uncredited) * That Hagen Girl (1947) as Julia Kane * Corridor of Mirrors (1948) as Lois * The Big Punch (1948) as Karen Long * The Dark Past (1948) as Ruth Collins * The Decision of Christopher Blake (1948) as Miss McIntyre (uncredited) * Crime Doctor's Diary (1949) as Jane Darrin * Kazan (1949) as Louise Maitlin * Tomorrow Is Too Late (1950) as Signorina Anna * Love and Poison (1950) as Queen Christina * Brief Rapture (1951) as Erika * The Woman's Angle (1952) as Enid Mansell * Viva il cinema!

It is native to Mediterranean Europe and parts of North Africa, but also naturalised in other parts of Europe, India and Pakistan. This herbaceous perennial resembles chamomile species in habitat and appearance. The plants known as pellitory-of-the-wall and spreading pellitory belong to a different family, the nettles (Urticaceae). Names Although one might assume from the specific epithet pyrethrum that this plant contains pyrethrins, it does not. Both pyrethrum and \\"pellitory\\" derive ultimately from the ancient Greek for \\"fire\\" (œÄ·ø¶œÅ). Cultivation Anacyclus pyrethrum var. depressus (sometimes considered a separate species, Anacyclus depressus), called mat daisy or Mount Atlas daisy, is grown as a spring-blooming, low-water ornamental. It produces mats of grey-green, ferny foliage and single daisy-like white flowers. It is suitable for growing in an alpine or rock garden.

According to Samguk Sagi (the oldest surviving Korean history book, written in the 12th century), Onjo, the son of Goguryeo's founder Jumong, founded the nation of Sipje (Ïã≠Ï†ú, ÂçÅÊøü; later became Baekje) on Wiryeseong in 18 BC, while his elder brother Biryu established himself in Michuhol (ÎØ∏Ï∂îÌôÄ, ÂΩåÈÑíÂøΩ) further to the west. The location of Michuhol is usually believed to be present-day Incheon. After some time, Biryu recognized that Michuhol's land was too barren and saline to sustain his people, so he moved to Wiryeseong with his people (Shortly after, the name of the state is changed from Sipje to Baekje). Later, Onjo moved further south because of Malgal to the north and Lelang to the east. The former Wiryeseong is called Habuk (north of the river) Wiryeseong and the latter is called Hanam (south of the river) Wiryeseong.This is not to be confused with modern Hanam city, which also means \\"south of the (Han) river.\\" The earthen walls of Pungnap Toseong and Mongchon Toseong in Songpa-gu, Seoul are believed by many to be the remains of Hanam Wiryeseong. During the Hanseong period, Baekje grew up against Southern Mahan and Northern Chinese Commanderies including Daifang, which attempted to violate their border. In the process, Baekje modified the political systems, and expended its territory to Mahan and Hwanghae region, and it became as a regional power. Wiryeseong served as Baekje‚Äôs capital until 475, when Goguryeo's King Jangsu attacked Baekje and captured Wiryeseong, as well as the whole Han River area, and killing Baekje's King Gaero. Baekje's next king Munju moved south and set the new capital at Ungjin (modern day Gongju city).

It had a population of 49,724 in 2011 which is now estimated to have risen to c.52,000. The town is an administrative district, separate from the surrounding Central District.Laws of Botswana, Ministry of Local Government  Mining  Nickel mining commenced in 1973 and has been the main activity since. The complex includes a mine and a smelter. All operations are now deep mining. Originally there were two tiny places called Selebi and Phikwe, which straddled a large undiscovered deposit of copper and nickel in the area. When the mineral wealth of the area was discovered in the 1960s a mine and a township were built in the woodland between the places with the combined name of Selebi-Phikwe. The main source of employment was the BCL Limited mine which excavated and smelted mixed copper- nickel ore from several shafts in deep and opencast mines. The opencast pit is now unused. Ore is transported from the shaft by rail for smelting. The locomotives used were steam-powered, having been bought from National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) and South African Railways (SAR). BCL only intended to stay in operation until 2010 and more recently 2013. It finally ceased operations in September 2016 putting thousands out of work.  Government and infrastructure  The Botswana Prison Service (BPS) operates the Selebi-Phikwe Prison.\\"Prisons and Rehabilitation.\\" (Archive) Government of Botswana. Retrieved on 26 March 2013. Phikwe Industrial Area provides premises for Factories and Business Houses as ancillary for the Mine. Construction companies include Watson, GSP, etc., SP Electricals, Britannia Backers, George Backers and Change and CO. The town is also home to the Eastern Military Garrison run by the Botswana Defence Force.  Energy  A small coal-fired power station was built along with the mine to meet the electricity needs of the mining operation and the surrounding area. Until the late 1980s, this was the only power station in Botswana. It was closed down some years ago when the Morupule Power Station began to produce power. Most of the electricity demand was met by importing electricity from South Africa. In the current situation of 'rationing' by the South African power supplier Eskom, Botswana suffers from power shortages. In 2010, a private company ENERGY POINT (PTY) LTD, promoted by a foreign direct investor from India, started its operation of the Manufacturing of UPS, inverters, surge protectors etc. But the investor could not continue due to non compliance of BEDI and a government promise to provide basic infrastructure such as industrial land etc. Still, the company made a significant mark in this area giving most of the businesses and residences an uninterrupted power supply.  Amenities and tourism  The town itself has a principal shopping mall, First Shopping Mall LESEDI shopping mall with ABC Bank and Barclays Extension Counter, Phikwe Square. There are four in-town hotels (Hotel Stonehouse, Cresta Bosele, Syringa Lodge and Travel Inn), several guest houses and a number of serviced apartment complexes. The Phokoje Bush Lodge is about seven kilometres from town. The town has a small airport which only operates during daylight hours but does not have refuelling facilities. It has a technical college for artisan level training. A College of Applied Arts & Technology is being planned. The town is on a tourist route from South Africa to the popular destinations of Okavango and Chobe. There is significant potential for birdwatching and fishing (bass and bream are well established but are not indigenous) at the Letsibogo Dam but, unfortunately, it is difficult to gain access to the dam due to rough terrain and necessity to camp on the shore. An experimental population of tigerfish (indigenous to the Limpopo basin) was introduced in 2009 which has proven that the environment would be suitable. The introduced population is thought to be insufficient for breeding. There are some local camp sites a few kilometres away from the dam. The water and wildlife at Letsibogo do not appear to have been negatively impacted by the pollution from BCL. Selebi-Phikwe has seven government schools and across the town, S Phikwe Senior Secondary School. Private schools include Kopano, Marula and Mount Pleasant. Selebi Phikwe hosts the biggest marathon in Botswana, the Phikwe Marathon; it was started by the late Boet Kahts and Phill Roberts who was a teacher at Selebi Phikwe Senior Secondary School in 1985 as a gesture of Community Service. The Marathon is classified as one of the best in the world by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). A report for SPEDU (Selebi Phikwe Economic Development), a local Regional Development Agency, suggests that there is significant potential for expansion of the marathon and also to apply the skills and experience gained by running that event for other events such as cross country cycling and quad biking and for bass fishing competitions at the Letsibogo Dam. The latter site also offers potential for bird watching and sailing if the infrastructure mentioned above were to be established.

He served as a Professor of Entomology at Imperial College London and as the second Imperial Entomologist to India. He left India after the death of two of his children from insect-borne diseases. He worked on applied entomology and initiated experiments on the use of chemicals to control insects. A formula developed by him was utilized to save Westminster Hall from destruction by wood-boring beetles while others were made use of to control lice in the trenches during the First World War. The success of his chemicals led to increased demand leading to the founding of a company to produce insecticides, Rentokil. He was killed in an accident while experimenting on fumigants to control insects. Biography Itchel Manor, demolished in 1954 Maxwell-Lefroy was born in the village of Crondall to Charles James Maxwell Lefroy of the 14th Hussars (whose grandfather was James Walker who had designed the Regent or Vauxhall Bridge in 1816) and Elizabeth Catherine, daughter of Alfred Henry McClintock, a Dublin surgeon. The hyphenated form Maxwell-Lefroy was adopted in 1875. He grew up in the family's Itchel Manor, on an ancient site which had once been property of the Bishop of Winchester. The manor itself had a long history, being mentioned in the Domesday Book, and filled with stories of ghosts and their hauntings (and demolished in 1954). As a child he was raised in an environment of opulence, with many servants at home to take care of the house and his needs.Fleming (2015). = Education = Harold was sent to school in Church Hill House in Crondall where one of his contemporaries, although a boarder unlike Maxwell- Lefroy, was Claude Grahame-White. He was later sent to study in Germany, and after returning to England in 1890 he was sent to Marlborough College where he was in Preshute House under master W.E. Mullins. Oddly he did not join the Natural History Society at school, contemporary members included William Keble Martin, Arthur Hill, and Lawrence C.H. Young (who went to Bombay in 1901 to work in a local business and also contributed to studies of the lepidoptera in the Bombay Natural History Society collections and died young in 1907). He finished school in 1895 and joined King's College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in the natural science tripos with first class in 1898. His specialization in entomology was influenced by David Sharp. He received a master's degree in 1902. = West Indies = Maxwell-Lefroy briefly served as assistant master at Seaford College, and then joined as an entomologist in Barbados from 1899. Before he left Barbados he got engaged to Kathleen Hamilton O'Meara, daughter of a former Provost Marshal in British Guiana from a Catholic family, leading to some disapproval from his mother and sister. His entomological work resulted in several bulletins being published. = India = A drag bag to dislodge and collect caterpillars from fields, an innovation by Maxwell-Lefroy In 1903, Maxwell-Lefroy was appointed entomologist to the Government of India (succeeding Lionel de Nic√©ville, who was the first entomologist, appointed in 1901). The appointment may have been influenced by David Sharp. His salary in India was set at 750 rupees a month rising 50 a year to a maximum of 1000 a month. He sailed by the P&O; steamer Borneo on 27th March and reached Bombay on 30 April 1903. He was then sent to Calcutta where he was to report to E.P. Stebbing. He married Kathleen on 22 January 1904 in a Catholic wedding at the Cathedral of the Holy Name, Bombay. In 1904, Maxwell-Lefroy was assisted by K. P. Ukkendan Unni Nair, a zoologist trained at the Madras Christian College. He then had other Indian assistants including S.C. Misra trained at Nagpur and had worked at Rajkumar College, C.C. Ghosh who graduated from Calcutta University and was in charge of the Pusa insectary, Gobindram Dutt from Punjab and D. Nowroji from Madras University. He was also assisted by the Second Imperial Entomologist F.M. Howlett. In 1905 he was involved in the creation of the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in Pusa, in the Indian state of Bihar, and he was appointed the first Imperial Entomologist. Title page of Indian Insect Life (1909) In October 1908 he accepted permanent employment with the Government of India. Maxwell-Lefroy convened a series of meetings on an all-India basis, to bring together all the entomologists of the country. From 1915, five such meetings were held at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, and these formed the foundation of entomological knowledge in India. He was succeeded in the position of Imperial Entomologist by T. Bainbrigge Fletcher. He published Indian Insect Life, a summary of the major insects of economic importance in 1906, in association with Frank Milburn Howlett. On November 10, 1910 their son Denis Charles died, possibly from typhoid, dysentery or some other fly-borne disease and the other son Cecil was immediately sent away to safety in Darjeeling to be taken care of at the Loreto Convent. The death led to his taking leave and returning to England the next year. His son Cecil was also accompanied by his Indian ayah Elizabeth. He took privilege leave from January 1911 for three months and then extended it by going on furlough. He gave lectures in England and he was appointed a lecturer at the Imperial College on 1 September 1911. He applied for resignation from his Indian government posting. He returned to Pusa on 29 July 1912 and was made an offer to retain him but he decided to take up a position at the Imperial College as professor of entomology. His resignation was formally accepted on 15 December 1912. = England = Maxwell-Lefroy moved to live initially in Strawberry Hill, and later Acton Lodge in Isleworth close to his workplace in South Kensington. In the early days, he used a motorbike with a sidecar to travel about. In 1913-1914, Lefroy was consulted by Frank Baines, Principal Architect of the Office of Works, to study ways of exterminating death watch beetles that had been found in Westminster Hall, beside England's Houses of Parliament. He began to try out various chemicals and finally came up with a 50% dichlorobenzene, 47% mineral oil and 3% barium oleate mixture to brush the wood with. This treatment was used by Baines who was then knighted for saving Westminster Hall. Lt. Col. Maxwell-Lefroy (seated centre) with volunteers from Pusa in 1916. The volunteers left to Mesopotamia to work under Beeson During the First World War, Maxwell-Lefroy volunteered but was rejected on medical grounds from military service. In 1915 he took up a position travelling across India as Imperial silk specialist. Along with E.C. Ansorge, magistrate and collector in Bihar and Orissa, he wrote a Report on an Inquiry into the Silk Industry in India (1917) in three volumes but not without a major interruption. While in Bangalore on the silk study, on 17 April 1916, he received a telegram from the government seeking help on fly control in Mesopotamia. Appointed as an acting Lt-Col, he was sent off with C.F.C. Beeson to assist he was shipped out from Bombay. He published on his investigations into the control of flies and other pests, one note in the Agricultural Journal of India included a photograph of his assistants from Pusa. He also introduced a treatment for the control of lice in the trenches called vermijelli that kept away jigger fleas and ticks. It was reported that there was a fall of 66% in cases of dysentery, cholera and typhoid after his measures were put in place. A bout of beri-beri invalided him and he returned to India, recovered and then travelled to England. Shortly after, there was a problem with weevils infesting wheat in Australia which hampered food supplies during the war. In October 1917 he sailed to San Francisco and then to Sydney where he examined the wheat weevil problem along with W.W. Froggatt, the Government entomologist and suggested various measures. He also examined the issue of sheep blowflies Lucilia sericata before setting off from Sydney to England in May 1919. In 1924, Lefroy and his assistant Elizabeth Eades started producing bottles of woodworm treatment fluid from a small factory in Hatton Garden to manage a stream of requests, this led to the formation by them of a company called Rentokil Limited (now Rentokil Initial) in 1925. He registered the company on 29 September 1924, originally under the name of Entokill but this was objected to by the Board of Trade. Maxwell-Lefroy's students included Evelyn Cheesman who took up a position at the insect house in the zoo from 1919. Maxwell-Lefroy had been appointed honorary curator for the insect house. She and Olive Lodge also attended his classes which otherwise included only male students. He encouraged their studies and when Cheesman set off for South Africa, he emphasized the need for anyone interested in insects to spend time in the tropics to fully appreciate the subject. In 1922 he began to collaborate with Bruce Woolf who started a film company called New Era films to produce short documentaries on natural history. He helped in the production of several short films dealing with insects including one on wasps and another on tiger beetles in a series called Secrets of Nature. = Death = Lefroy once became unconscious in March 1925 while experimenting in his laboratory on poison gases to control houseflies. He was administered oxygen for an hour before he became conscious and returned to work in April. He was however unlucky and killed by poisonous fumes in a laboratory accident in October 1925. He had become unconscious once and after recovering, he had returned to his laboratory. He was found dead on the 15th of October after his wife alarmed at his absence went to the laboratory. It was estimated by the postmortem that he died at 6.35 PM on 14 October 1925. He had been trying out various gases to kill the larvae of houseflies (his biographer, Laurence Fleming, suggests that his hatred for houseflies may have to do with the death of his son. He also notes that Maxwell-Lefroy had been suffering from cancer and that there were ideas among some that it could have been a suicide.). His assistants including Olive Lodge had no knowledge of the composition of the poison gas. It is thought that he was experimenting with Lewisite. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His position at the Imperial College was taken up by Balfour Browne who ensured that the flasks with unknown chemicals that Maxwell-Lefroy was working with were buried. = Family = Maxwell- Lefroy and Kathleen had three children of whom the first, Gladys Kathleen died in infancy, and the second, Charles died in November 1910 while he was in Pusa and was the cause for his premature exit from India. The only child who survived was Cecil Anthony (d. 1995) who became a general manager of Burmah Oil Company and was later made CBE. He wrote an unfinished memoir on the life of his father which was posthumously edited as a biography published in 2015 by Laurence Fleming. Kathleen died on 4 December 1967. Publications Maxwell-Lefroy published numerous journal articles and memoirs published by government departments.

Campbell had alleged that on the morning of July 15, 1871, in Thorndale, Middlesex County, Ontario, two black-faced men broke into George and Phoebe's log cabin home and brutally hacked George to death with an axe because he refused to hand over some money. They had attempted to use a gun which misfired. During the investigation, six local men were arrested, including Thomas Coyle, who was George's farmhand. Doubt about Phoebe's innocence arose rapidly as she was seen talking with Coyle, she also seemed to have done nothing to help save her husband as he was being murdered, also she seemed very unemotional following the funeral for George. A coroner's autopsy also showed that indeed George was murdered by Phoebe and Coyle. \\"I don't care. I'm innocent and I don't care.\\", Phoebe stated. She then accused Coyle of the murder then quickly changed her mind then accused her cousin. Phoebe's murder trial began on April 1, 1872, with much public interest. Phoebe accused George of having an affair with her cousin's wife. During the trial, the crown prosecutor produced a letter which stated, \\"I never shall say you done any such thing again‚Äîif I have to die for it.\\" When asked why she changed her testimony, she claimed the ghost of her late husband visited her and declared her and Coyle innocent. The crown prosecutor responded, \\"You can hardly expect anyone to believe such nonsense!\\" After the trial, the jury took just one hour to reach a guilty verdict. Phoebe then sobbed as the judge sentenced her to hanging. She later confessed that she and Coyle murdered George so they could marry. Coyle did go to trial for his crime but was acquitted. He later moved to England. She was hanged on June 20 at the age of 25 and was again said to be emotionless as she was about to be hanged, holding a lace handkerchief in her hand until after she died. So much public attention was given to the story that postcards depicting the crime were made, which were bought by many. General references *Doty, Christopher. The Trials of Phoebe Campbell.

The municipality was formerly the seat of two princely states during the British Raj, Dewas Junior state and Dewas Senior state, ruled by the Puar clan of Maratha. The city is the administrative capital of Dewas district. Dewas is an industrialised city and houses a government bank note press Etymology The name Dewas is derived from the Devi Vaishini hill in the city, commonly known as Tekri.http://www.onlinedewas.com The hill has a temple of the deities Devi Tulja Bhawani, Chamunda Mata and Kalika Mata. The word Dewas is believed to be a sandhi of the words Dev (deity) and Vas Marathi (abode), so Dewas means house of the god. Swami Shivom Tirtha wrote the history of the hill (Tekri ) of Dewas in his book, Sadhan Shikhar. Inspired by the area, E.M. Forster wrote The Hill of Devi in 1953. The district takes its name from the district headquarters town, Dewas, which is said to have been derived on the basis of two traditions. One is that Dewas lies at the base of a conical hill, known as Chamunda hill, on top of which the shrine of Chamunda is located. The image of the goddess is cut into the wall of a cave, known as Devi Vashini or the goddess's residence. From this, the name Dewas (dev-vas) seems to have been derived. The other view of the probable origin is from the name of the founder of the city, Dewasa Bania.  History  Dewas was formerly the capital of two princely states of British India. The original state was founded in the first half of the 18th century by the brothers Tukaji Rao (senior) and Jivaji Rao (junior), from the Puar clan of Marathas. They had advanced into Malwa with the Maratha Peshwa, Baji Rao, in 1728. The brothers divided the territory among themselves; their descendants ruled as the senior and junior branches of the family. After 1841, each branch ruled his own portion as a separate state, though the lands belonging to each were intimately entangled; in Dewas, the capital town, the two sides of the main street were under different administrations and had different arrangements for water supply and lighting. The senior branch had an area of and a population of in 62,312 in 1901, while the area of the junior branch was and had a population of 54,904 that same year. Both Dewas states were in the Malwa Agency of the Central India Agency. There were many Jagirdars and Zamindars of the estate; one of them was Zamindar BinjrajTapdiya from the village Binjana and Sanjay Nagar. On his name only the name of Binjana was kept. He was popularly known as Binjana seth. His eldest son Kisanlal ruled the region under puar dynasty for six decades. After him his son Seth Vallabhdas Tapdiya had ruled the village. They were the biggest Jagirdars in the kingdom of Maharaj Krishnaji Rao III Puar. After India's independence in 1947, the Rajas of Dewas acceded to India, and their states were integrated into Madhya Bharat, which became a state of India in 1950. In 1956, Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh state. Geography Dewas lies northeast of Indore, southeast of Ujjain, and southwest of Shajapur. The city is located on the level plains of the Malwa plateau; to the south, the land rises gently to the Vindhya Range, which is the source of the Chambal and Kali Sindh rivers that flow north through the district on their way to the Ganges. The main river in Dewas is Kshipra. Demographics As of 2011 Indian Census, Dewas had a total population of 289,550, of which 150,081 were males and 139,469 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 35,437. The total number of literates in Dewas was 215,088, which constituted 74.3% of the population with male literacy of 79.9% and female literacy of 68.3%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Dewas was 84.6%, of which male literacy rate was 91.1% and female literacy rate was 77.7%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 56,366 and 9,861 respectively. Dewas had 57397 households in 2011. Administration The Member of Parliament from Dewas is Mahendra Singh Solanki of BJP who was elected in the Lok Sabha Election 2019.  Industry  Dewas was known for being a production centre of retail opium in the 1800s, as noted in the 1895 first report of the Royal Commission on Opium. Rapid industrialisation took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but due to inadequate infrastructure, the pace has slowed since the late 1980s. In recent years, some industries have closed their operations due to a shortage of sufficient infrastructure to support growth; there is a shortage of water due to excessive usage in previous decades. The city has many industrial units providing employment to thousands of workers. The largest companies include Tata, Kirloskar and John Deere. Dewas is known as the soy capital of India and is a major part of the soy bean processing industry in the country. Due to its location above sea level at one corner of the Malwa plateau, constant wind flows in the region are suitable for harvesting wind energy. There are more than 100 wind mills on a hill from Dewas, generating around 15 megawatts of power. These were financed by a few private companies which sought a reliable power supply.

It was the most expensive Chinese film produced at the time of its release.http://bbs.wenxuecity.com/63745720387/916099.html Plot Set in third century BC China, the story of The Emperor's Shadow revolves around the relationship between Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, and later the First Emperor; and the musician Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli's mother was the king's wet nurse when the young king was a hostage in the Zhao state, but they were separated after the former returns to Qin to become king. After reaching adulthood, Ying Zheng embarks on a series of wars to fulfill his plan of unifying China. He kidnaps Gao Jianli from the Yan state to compose a powerful anthem for his new state. The two conflict over the new composition, the construction of grand public works, Ying Zheng's ruthless mass killing policies, and Ying Zheng's daughter, Princess Yueyang.

In one of the climaxes of the film, the king states his belief that through music he can \\"control the minds and hearts of the people\\", echoing Mao Zedong's Yan'an talks of 1942. Music is perceived by the monarch as being as important as military power. Whereas his armies can conquer his rivals, he needs the arts to exert spiritual and ideological control. At the premiere of the film on 7 June 1996 in Beijing, director Zhou Xiaowen noted: \\"Chinese rulers have always wanted to control our spirit. But they cannot succeed in doing so.\\" Reception After The Emperor's Shadow was released in five major Chinese cities, it was banned by state authorities without any clear reason being given. Eight months later permission was given for re-release. The film has been criticized in China for its many historical inaccuracies. Chief among these is the distortion of the character of Gao Jianli. According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, Gao Jianli was a friend of the assassin Jing Ke, who fails in an attempt upon Ying Zheng's life. Other minor errors, mostly of academic interest, also contribute to the film's lack of historical authenticity. The director Zhou Xiaowen defended his film by saying that it was an exploration of ideas and values for the present day and was not intended as a strictly historical depiction of the First Emperor. In a 1999 interview, he said \\"I don't like history; I just like the buildings, the palaces, the dress.\\" The film influenced the creation of Tan Dun's 2006 opera The First Emperor.

Its purpose was the negotiation of a treaty to replace the Treaty of S√®vres, which, under the new government of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk was no longer recognized by Turkey. The conference opened in November 1922, with representatives from Great Britain, France, Italy and Turkey. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey selected ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, Rƒ±za Nur and Chief Rabbi Chaim Nahum as their representatives. Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, was the co-ordinator of the conference, which he dominated. France and Italy had assumed that the Chanak Crisis had caused British prestige with Turkey to be irrevocably damaged, but they were shocked to discover that Turkish respect for Britain was undiminished. British troops had held their positions at Chanak, but the French had been ordered to withdraw. The conference lasted for eleven weeks. It heard speeches from Benito Mussolini of Italy and Raymond Poincar√© of France. The proceedings of the conference were notable for the stubborn diplomacy of ƒ∞smet Pasha. Already partially deaf, he would simply turn off his hearing aid when Curzon launched into lengthy speeches denouncing the Turkish position. Once Curzon was finished, ƒ∞smet Pasha would restate his original demands and be oblivious to Curzon's denunciations. At the conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the \\"freedom of the straits\\", Britain's main concern. The matter of the status of Mosul was deferred since Curzon refused to be budged from the British position that the area was part of Iraq. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of its goals. On 30 January 1923, it issued a statement that it did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a basis of discussion. The Turks, therefore, refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to ƒ∞smet Pasha to sign, and when he refused, Curzon broke off negotiations and left that night on the Orient Express. The Treaty of Lausanne was finally signed on 24 July 1923. Background The harsh Treaty of S√®vres imposed upon the government of the Ottoman Empire after World War I by the Allied Powers included provisions that demanded the partition of Anatolia. The treaty demanded the occupation of French and Italian zones of occupation in the southeast and southwest, the cession of much of western Anatolia to Greece and the establishment of two independent states: Armenia and Kurdistan in the east and the southwest. The Ottoman state was to have a small army and navy without heavy artillery, aeroplanes or battleships, and its budget was to be placed under the supervisions of an Allied financial commission. Turkish nationalists were vehemently opposed to those clauses and decided to fight to inhibit their effectiveness. In the Turkish War of Independence that followed, the Turkish Nationalist Army defeated the Greeks and created resolutions with the French and Italians to secure a sovereign, independent Turkish state in Anatolia. Preliminary meetings The location of Lausanne, Switzerland, was chosen as a neutral venue by Britain, France and Italy to discuss their new policies in the Near East. Representatives of the Soviet Union would be invited solely to renegotiate the Straits Convention. Before the conference even began, Lord Curzon of Britain expressed doubts upon the reliability of France and Italy for support and stated, \\"I am not going into the conference in order to find myself let down very likely on the first day by the French or Italians\\". He demanded a preliminary meeting of the three nations to reach a preliminary strategy before he travelled to Lausanne. Curzon prepared a list of British demands separated into two categories. Essential ones included the Greek retention of Western Thrace, the freedom of the Straits to shipping, demilitarised zones on the coasts and the retention of Allied troops in Istanbul until a new treaty was ratified. Most desirable ones included measures for the protection of the minorities in Turkey, preliminary safeguards of the Armenian population, the satisfaction of Allied requirements of the Ottoman debt, capitulations and the future financial and economic regime in Turkey. Preliminary meetings, taking place in Paris between Curzon and French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar√© on 18 November 1922, lasted five hours. Poincar√© addressed each of Lord Curzon's aims point by point and reluctantly agreed to most of them. Both then met with Benito Mussolini who quickly agreed to the agenda because of his overall indifference to the negotiations. The first official meeting of the Lausanne Conference was held on 21 November 1922, and Curzon appointed himself president of the conference and instituted three subcommissions. The first and arguably most important one addressed territorial and military questions, the second one addressed the financial and economic questions and the third was meant to answer the future of judicial status of foreigners in Turkey. The first was chaired by Lord Curzon, the second by French Ambassador Camille Barr√®re and the third by the Italian diplomat Marquis Garone. On 23 November, Curzon's commission began its processions. ƒ∞smet Pasha delivered a long speech in which he demanded the cession of Karaagac, a suburb of Edirne, which had been retained by Greece as part of Western Thrace. Curzon responded by chastising the Turks for making what he considered to be excessive demands. He was met with widespread support by the French and Italians and went on to state that the \\"exhibition of so firm an Allied front at this stage and on so important an issue took [the] Turks very much by surprise and will probably exercise a decisive influence in our future proceedings\\". That feeling did not last, however, since by December, Turkish obstruction and stubbornness and Italian concessions had all but halted negotiations. The Soviet delegation arrived in Lausanne on 28 November 1922 with Georgy Vasilyevich Chicherin as its chief spokesman. It demanded to be admitted to the conference as a whole, and when the Straits Commission officially met on 5 December, it also demanded the closure of the Straits, both in peace and war, to warships and aircraft of all nations except Turkey. Both proposals were rejected, and any Soviet protest was ignored. On 16 December, Curzon decided that he would remain at the conference over the Christmas holiday to expedite the conference‚Äôs conclusion. He intended to draw up a preliminary treaty containing the points already agreed to in the meetings with the Turks and then he would invite ƒ∞smet Pasha to accept or reject it as a statement of agreed principle. Curzon would let experts fill in the rest. After Christmas, however, the increasing Turkish inflexibility on generally all significant clauses and rumors of an imminent Turkish military advance on Istanbul led Curzon to seek a private meeting with ƒ∞smet. Curzon found the Turkish foreign minister \\"impervious to argument, warning or appeal, and can only go on repeating the same catchwords, indulging in the same futil quibbles, and making the same childish complaints\\". Curzon's intention of presenting the Turks with a preliminary treaty was further hindered by a lack of correspondence from Poincar√© in regards to the acceptability of the conditions presented to France. In mid-January 1923, Maurice Bompard, who had taken the place of the sickly Barrere as chief French delegate, visited Paris to relay with Poincar√© and returned to the Conference with a document of 24 headings dictated by Poincar√© that represented a French demand for substantial concessions to Turkey on most issues to bring about a faster conclusion. Curzon described an \\"unconditional surrender to the Turks\\", adamantly refused to accept any of the \\"eleventh hour proposals\\" and went on to decide on a fixed date for the departure of the British delegation from the conference. On that day, he explained, the Turks would be asked to accept or to reject the text of the treaty that Britain was drawing up without including any of Poincar√©‚Äôs amendments. When the draft was presented to the Turks on 31 January, ƒ∞smet asked for an adjournment of eight days. There was further meetings of the Allied delegations on the morning of 2 January during which Curzon reluctantly agreed to further modifications on capitulations and the tariffs, the abandonment of reparations due from Turkey and the removal of all restrictions on the size of the Turkish Army in Thrace. On 4 February, the Turks accepted all territorial terms of the draft treaty with a reservation about Mosul, but they rejected the judicial, economic and financial clauses and demanded reparations from Greece for the damage its army caused in ƒ∞zmir, a demand that Curzon had already rejected because of the poverty of Greece. Although the Allies agreed to further slight changes in the economic clauses, the Turks still refused to sign the treaty on the grounds that the economic and the judicial clauses were still unsatisfactory. It was then reported that for the next several hours, ƒ∞smet Pasha feigned total ineptitude in the understanding of the simplest of propositions. The ploy of stubbornness aimed to force another revision of the treaty. Every warning, argument or plea to ƒ∞smet lacked even the smallest effect. Then, negotiations broke down, and all parties returned to their respective capitals. Resolution In early March 1923, a Turkish note suggested new propositions towards the still-unsettled financial, economic and judicial questions. Curzon accepted the Turkish proposals on the basis that the conference would be revived, but he ruled out any further revisions of the territorial clauses already resolved. Between 21 and 27 March 1923, British, French, Italian and Japanese experts met in London to discuss Allied criteria for the settlement of the still-unresolved issues of the conference. The conference eventually reopened at Lausanne on 23 April 1923. Once again three commissions were set up. The first dealt with the remaining territorial questions and the rights of foreigners and was chaired by Sir Horace Rumbold, the primary British delegate, since Curzon refused to return to Lausanne. The second was under General Maurice Pell√©, now the main French delegate, and dealt with financial questions. The third was under , the chief Italian delegate, and dealt with economic questions. Most of the proceedings were of a highly-technical nature and progressed slowly. France renewed its demand for the payment of reparations to the Allies by Turkey although, as Curzon pointed out, the Allies had agreed to abandon them in February. No agreement be reached with Turks on the future judicial regime for foreigners in their country. Finally, the Turkish insistence for the Greeks to pay reparations to Turkey for war damage in ƒ∞zmir almost led to a renewal of Turkish-Greek hostilities. On 24 April, the Greek delegation threatened to walk out of the conference on Saturday, the 26th, if the Turks did not accept the Greek offer of Karaaƒüa√ß to replace reparations. Mustafa Kemal intervened, and his government agreed that ƒ∞smet could accept Karaaga√ß instead of reparations if it was coupled with a favourable settlement of the remaining questions. On the afternoon of the 26th, after appeals from all the delegates at the conference, ƒ∞smet accepted the compromise, which was coupled with rather-vague assurances by the Allies that every effort would be made to satisfy Turkish requirements on other issues. However, after a further appeal to Poincar√© by Crewe on 6 July, the former accepted a British proposal that a declaration about the debt interest should be omitted from the treaty, and the matter should be dealt with by a separate note from the Allies to Turkey. After a six-hour meeting on the subject between the Allied and the Turkish delegates, the issue was finally settled. At 1.30 a.m. on 9 July 1923, agreement was reached on the debt's interest, on concessions and on the evaluation of the Allies from Constantinople after Turkey had ratified the peace treaty. However, there were still delays over the settlement of other minor issues, and it was only on 24 July 1923 that the treaty was signed at a plenary session of the conference. Treaty of Lausanne It was known from early on in the conference that Turkey was left in a perilous position since much of it had been destroyed in the Wars of Independence. The Turks needed an end to conflict and normal relations with Europe to build and sustain their economy. Though ƒ∞smet Pasha, was extremely stubborn and near unworkable during the conference, he acted so mainly in matters that threatened Turkish independence. On matters that did not touch the heart of Turkish independence, ƒ∞smet eventually accepted Allied wishes to secure Turkey's place in the future economy. He easily accepted British and French colonial rule in Palestine, Syria and Iraq. Although ƒ∞smet would surely have loved to negate the old Ottoman debt, a great weight on the new state, he accepted a proportional division of the debt among the successor states of the empire. On matters on independence, the Turks were resolute in their stance. The capitulations and the rules that had allowed foreigners to have their own legal systems in the Ottoman Empire, their own post offices and other extraterritorial rights were ended. Foreigners and minorities were to be governed by the same sets of laws and to have the same rights as Turks. Social and religious institutions of Christians were specifically allowed but not separate political institutions. Furthermore, the treaty attempted to rectify the expulsion of entire populations in the Balkans by a population exchange. Greeks had lived in Anatolia for thousands of years, and the Turks had lived in what is now Greece for more than 500 years, but both Greece and Turkey had come to realise that the two populations could no longer live together in co-operation. The viciousness of the Balkan Wars essentially destroyed the tolerance between the cultures. Most of the Turks of Greece, in fact, had been expelled after 1878, especially in the Balkan Wars. Most Anatolian Greeks had fled in 1922. At Lausanne, Greece and Turkey agreed to relocate most of the Muslims and Greeks who had remained in the other's country. Only the Greeks of Istanbul and the Turks of western Thrace were excluded. =Mosul question= On 4 February 1923, while the Lausanne Conference was still in session, both obstinate parties laying claim to the Mosul region, Turkey and Britain, deferred the dispute from the conference's agenda since its deadlock was so firm. Since the First World War, the British had sought to contain the Bolshevik threat by expanding their presence in the Middle Eastern regions around Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. Turkey however remained adamant that the region was owed to them based on the racial unity of the Turks and the Kurds, arguments that most of the disputed area's trade was with Anatolia, the illegal occupation of the Allies in Mosul and the presence of self-determination from which the inhabitants actually wanted to be a part of Turkey. Lord Curzon, however, addressed each of these claims individually claiming that most majority of the inhabitants were racially Kurds who were of Indo-European origin and fundamentally different from the Turks, most of the trade of Mosul was with Iraq but not Anatolia, the British government had been legally entrusted with the mandate over Iraq by the League of Nations and the frequent Kurdish revolts during the nineteenth century immediately before the war demonstrated that the Kurds were unwilling to be a part of Turkey. Britain eventually brought the dispute before the League of Nations, which ruled that neither party had any right to occupy and control the area. The Kurdish population was instead divided between Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which ended any aspirations the Kurds had for self-determination. In return for Turkey‚Äôs concession, it was then afforded an invitation to join the League of Nations to complete the isolation of Bolshevik Russia. =Straits question= The Straits question of the conference further emphasisdd the prevailing paranoia of the encroaching Bolsheviks, especially by the Allies. At the end of the war, the victorious powers imposed the terms of the Treaty of S√®vres, which placed the control of the Straits under the Commission of the Straits. The Commission would be composed of the representatives of the Great Powers and Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. With the recovery of Turkish power in Anatolia, however, the peace treaty became inoperative within two years. The sessions of the conference devoted to the Straits became a duel between Curzon of Britain and Chicherin of Russia, the latter of whom demanded the passage of military vessels through the Straits to be prohibited at all times and the restoration of full Turkish sovereignty over the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles with an unrestricted right to fortify their shores. Eventually, the British prevailed by enacting Article I of the Straits Convention of 24 July 1923, which stated the principle of freedom of transit and of navigation through the Straits during both peace and war. Furthermore, Article IV stipulated that the shores of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles as well as the contiguous islands in the Aegean and in Marmara would be demilitarised. Aftermath The Lausanne Conference officially recognized the sovereignty of the new Republic of Turkey internationally. Turkey, in a sense, achieved what the Ottoman Empire had set out to do prior to World War I: receive equal treatment by the Western powers and assert its place in the international political sphere. The treaty restricted the boundaries of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey and formally relinquished all Turkish claims on the Dodecanese Islands, Cyprus, Egypt and Sudan, Syria and Iraq. In Article 3, Turkey had its southern border also become rigidly defined, and it officially ceded the territories of Yemen, Asir, and parts of Hejaz, including Medina. Turkey also officially ceded Adakale Island in the River Danube to Romania by Articles 25 and 26. According to Article 10, Turkey gave up any of its privileges in Libya.http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne The Armenians also lost hope of reestablishing a large presence in East Anatolia under the treaty and were instead afforded a small homeland in Soviet Armenia, which in 1922 became a part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Aside from the redrawing of geographic borders, Robert Gerwarth stated that the conference sanctioned relocation of ethnic and religious populations had inauspicious consequences and \\"had a significance that went well beyond the Greek and Turkish context to which it ostensibly applied. The Convention effectively established the legal right of state governments to expel large parts of their citizens on the grounds of 'otherness'. It fatally undermined cultural, ethnic and religious plurality as an ideal to which to aspire and a reality with which - for all their contestations - most people in the European land empires had dealt with fairly well for centuries\\".

It is used for ring worm of the body, groin (jock itch), and feet (athlete's foot). It is applied to the skin or vagina as a cream or ointment. Common side effects include itchiness or irritation of the area in which it was applied. Use in pregnancy is believed to be safe for the baby. Miconazole is in the imidazole family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make ergosterol, an important part of their cell membrane. Miconazole was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Miconazole is mainly used externally for the treatment of ringworm including jock itch and athlete's foot. Internal application is used for oral or vaginal thrush (yeast infection). This oral gel may also be used for the lip disorder angular cheilitis and other associated systems. In the UK, miconazole may be used to treat neonatal oral thrush, while the alternative nystatin is only licensed for patients over the age of one month, but drug interactions are possible. Side effects Unlike nystatin, some miconazole is absorbed by the intestinal tract when used orally (and possibly if used vaginallyBritish National Formulary '45' March 2003); this may lead to drug interactions. Interactions are possible with anticoagulants, phenytoin, terbinafine, some newer atypical antipsychotics, cyclosporin, and some statins used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Miconazole inhibits the fungal enzyme 14Œ±-sterol demethylase, resulting in a reduced production of ergosterol. In addition to its antifungal actions, miconazole, similarly to ketoconazole, is known to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. =Pharmacokinetics= After application to the skin, miconazole can be measured in the skin for up to four days. Less than 1% is absorbed into the bloodstream, where 88.2% are bound to plasma proteins and 10.6% to blood cells. The substance is partly metabolized and mainly eliminated via the faeces. Chemistry The solubilities of miconazole nitrate powder are 0.03% in water, 0.76% in ethanol and up to 4% in acetic acid.United States Patent 5461068 Other uses Miconazole is also used in Ektachrome film developing in the final rinse of the Kodak E-6 process and similar Fuji CR-56 process, replacing formaldehyde. Fuji Hunt also includes miconazole as a final rinse additive in their formulation of the C-41RA rapid access color negative developing process.

He was one of the founding members of the Associated Motion Picture Advertisers. Biography Born in Frostburg, Maryland, in 1882, Reichenbach worked both for actors as an agent and for the film studios as a promoter. Among his first jobs was to promote a woman called \\"Sober Sue\\" who never smiled. He got her a contract at the Victoria Theater on Broadway and made them offer $1,000 to any New York comedian who could make her laugh. Actually, the woman had M√∂bius syndrome‚Äîi.e. paralyzed face muscles‚Äîso she was incapable of laughter. September Morn: The Comstock painting Between 1914-1916 he served as publicity director for various motion picture companies: Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Co., Alco Film Corp., Bosworth Inc., Metro Pictures, Equitable Motion Picture Corp., World Film Co., and Frohman Amusement Corp. In December 1916 Reichenbach founded his own public relations company. Reichenbach claimed to have popularized the painting September Morn, but that story is disputed. To promote the sequel the Return of Tarzan, Reichenbach hired an actor who checked into the Hotel Bellclaire with a name Thomas R. Zann. Zann had a huge crate that was hoisted to his room through a window. Then he ordered fifteen pounds of raw beef. When the cook and the hotel detective arrived, they saw that the meat was for the guest's pet lion. Hotel called for police and the \\"Mr Zann\\" explained to them and the press that he was a huge Tarzan fan. One of the actors Reichenbach worked for was Rudolf Valentino. Reichenbach convinced him to grow beard to cause a bad reaction that was followed by a good one when he \\"agreed\\" to shave it. For the 1915 film Trilby, which included nude scenes and hypnotism, Reichenbach hired a young woman to run several times around the block and take a seat besides him just before the movie ended. She looked agitated and exhausted and Reichenbach hinted that the hypnosis scenes in the movie might have something to do with it. He also arranged that various psychologists would speculate on possible effects of hypnosis through cinema. In other publicity stunts, Reichenbach would stage fake kidnappings of actresses set to appear in his films. One attempt involved crossing the border into Mexico, which resulted in United States president Woodrow Wilson writing an angry letter to Reichenbach asking him to stop. In 1928, Reichenbach was managing the Colony Theater in New York City and took Walt Disney's animated film Steamboat Willie for a two-week run. When Reichenbach was working for actor Francis X. Bushman, he took him to see studio executives. He began to walk with Bushman from the railway station and dropped pennies to the street from his pocket. Many people followed them, picking up the coins. The crowd gave the studio executives an impression that Bushman was very popular and they signed him up for a big contract with Metro Pictures. For The Virgin of Stamboul, he hired actors to pose as a clandestine Turkish rescue party that was hunting for a royal bride that had eloped with an American soldier. Reichenbach leaked the details to the press. His 1931 book, Phantom Fame, written with David Freedman, was the basis of the 1932 film The Half-Naked Truth. Harry Reichenbach died July 4, 1931.

The ports of Port Lavaca and Point Comfort have been established on the bay, and are the main areas of human habitation. Linnville was located on the bay until its abandonment after the Great Raid of 1840, and the major port of Indianola was found near the confluence with the main Matagorda Bay, until the town's final destruction following the massive hurricane of 1886. Smaller communities include Olivia, Alamo Beach and Magnolia Beach. Lavaca Bay is approximately northeast of Corpus Christi, about southwest of Houston, and southeast of San Antonio. The bay is noted for its superfund site, caused by mercury pollution from the heavy industry in Point Comfort (specifically Alcoa), across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca. Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination, the bay supports a large finfish population, and the efforts of environmental organizations and the federal government have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas. History Carancahua Bay (yellow), Chocolate Bay (brown), East Matagorda Bay (red), Keller Bay (lime), Lavaca Bay (orange), Matagorda Bay (purple), Tres Palacios Bay (magenta), Turtle Bay (olive) Lavaca Bay was formed when the sea level rose following the last ice age, flooding the Lavaca River-Garcitas Creek basin. The name comes from the Spanish adaptation of the French vache or cow, given to the area by French explorer Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle for the sightings of Plains Bison, which were once common near the bay and the creeks that feed it. It is believed La Salle established his Fort St. Louis colony near the bay on Garcitas Creek. The first sizable human settlement on the bay shore was at the town of New Port, established in 1831 by Irish merchant John J. Linn as part of De Le√≥n's colony. The site was later renamed Linnville, and grew to a population of 200 by 1839. It was described as \\"a place of considerable business\\" in Sketches of Texas in 1840, and was used extensively during the early years of the Republic of Texas. Future San Antonio Mayor Samuel Maverick owned a warehouse in the town, along with many other prominent Texans. The town was destroyed during the Great Raid of 1840, orchestrated by the Comanche Indians, and was later abandoned. Port Lavaca or Lavaca, developed after the abandonment of Linnville. It grew substantially following the destruction of Indianola, and became a prominent shipping location and national leader in shrimp production. Across the bay and currently connected by Texas State Highway 35, the town of Point Comfort is found. It was incorporated in 1953 at a citywide vote and is known for its large aluminium and petrochemical plants built in the 1960s. The small town of Olivia, which was founded in 1892 as a Swedish Lutheran community, is located on the shores of Keller Bay. The unincorporated towns of Alamo Beach, established around 1900, and Magnolia Beach, founded sometime thereafter, and named for the Magnolia figs produced in the area, are found north of the remains of the ghost town of Indianola. Features Lavaca Bay is the largest extension of the Matagorda Bay system and includes its own extensions of Chocolate Bay to the southwest, Cox Bay to the east, and Keller Bay to the southeast. The Lavaca River as well as Garcitas Creek and Venado Creek supply the bay with fresh water from the north. Channels have been dredged to connect the bay to the Intracoastal Waterway, which runs to the south. On average, the bay is about in depth. Unlike most of the Matagorda Bay system, Lavaca Bay has a mostly muddy bottom with large amounts of oyster reefs and spoils islands formed by the dredging of several canals. The shores are lined with grassy bluffs and a thick cover of trees. The Lavaca River enters near the Port Lavaca Causeway as it traverses Lavaca Bay from Port Lavaca to Point Comfort at the center of the bay, which is also its narrowest width. The river flows southeast from its source in northeast Gonzales County, draining approximately into Lavaca Bay. South of the Port Lavaca Causeway in Point Comfort, on the bay's eastern shore, a heavy industrial sector is located, which lines the coast to Cox Bay, which extends to the east. South of Cox Bay is the larger Keller Bay extension, which extends the bay to its easternmost point near Olivia. Below the extension, is a narrow peninsula, bounded by Matagorda Bay to the south, which extends west to the mouth of Lavaca Bay. Across the mouth on the western shore, past the Matagorda Ship Channel, which runs through the middle of the bay to Point Comfort, the town of Magnolia Beach is found. To the northwest is the town of Alamo Beach, located on Gailinipper Point, from which a major oyster reef begins across the bay to Point Comfort. The point is located on the northeastern extreme of a headland that juts to the north, forming Chocolate Bay to the west. Port Lavaca is found north of Chocolate Bay, back at the Port Lavaca Causeway. North of the causeway is a large circular extension, forming the northern boundary of the Lavaca Bay. The northwestern extreme is formed by Garcitas Cove, fed by Garcitas Creek, which flows from its source in DeWitt County. To the east is Venado Creek, which converges with the bay, northwest of the mouth of the Lavaca River. Ecosystem Additional salt marsh added to the bay Lavaca Bay hosts a wide range of finfish including Black drum, Flounder, Redfish, Sheepshead and Speckled trout, however it suffers from mercury pollution. An Alcoa plant in Point Comfort dumped an estimated of mercury into the bay per day in the 1960s, affecting . A mercury superfund was established at the site, and the processing of oysters and blue crab in certain locations was prohibited. A study revealed that the bay's detritus is more than ten times as contaminated as nearby Keller Bay. The pollution issue is a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort. However, Alcoa has worked with state and federal officials, spending $110 million to reduce the size of the superfund site, as part of a 2005 settlement. Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt marsh and 11 acres of oyster reef habitat. Locals have estimated that the only area still affected by contamination is just offshore from the Alcoa plant. Signs warning boaters of the water's toxicity are found at the site. The stigma attached to the bay due to reports of pollution has discouraged fishing, enabling a healthy population to develop. Industry Industry in Point Comfort Industry is heavy along the bay, with an abundance of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent as it was in the 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world. However this pier is now memorialized by its remains, posts, and small platforms no longer accessible from the shore stand alongside the modern causeway.

He also appears in many of the continuing sequel Oz novels also written by Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; . 145. Although the character of the Wicked Witch of the West is the most notable and famous Oz villain (due to her appearance in the 1939 MGM musical The Wizard of Oz), it is actually the Nome King who is the most frequent antagonist throughout the entire book series. Precursor Katharine M. Rogers, a biographer of L. Frank Baum, has argued that there was a precursor of the Nome King in one of Baum's pre-Oz works. In the Adventures in Phynnyland (1899), later known as A New Wonderland, and The Magical Monarch of Mo, there is an extremely similar character called King Scowleyow.Rogers (2002), p. 59-61 Rogers finds him a \\"convincingly evil\\" villain despite his ridiculous name. His people reportedly live in caves and mines. They dig iron and tin out of the rocks in their environment. They melt these metals into bars and sell them.Rogers (2002), p. 59-61 Scowleyow hates the King of Phunnyland and all his people, because they live so happily and \\"care nothing for money.Rogers (2002), p. 59-61 He decides to destroy Phunnyland and instructs his mechanics to build what is essentially a robot. It is described as a great man built of cast iron, and containing within him machinery. The robot is called \\"the Cast-iron Man\\".Rogers (2002), p. 59-61 The metallic creature roars, rolls his eyes, and gnashes his teeth. It is set on marching across a valley, destroying trees and houses on its path.Rogers (2002), p. 59-61 Rogers notes the similarities between Scowleyow and the Nome King. They represent the negation of good will and happiness. They are associated with the underground and material wealth. Scowleyow is a powerful figure who uses his technological knowledge to create a machine capable only of destruction. And both villains demonstrate the tendency of evil towards self- destruction.Rogers (2002), p. 59-61 In the novels The character called the Nome King is originally named Roquat the Red. Later, he takes the name Ruggedo, which Baum first used in a stage adaptation. Even after Ruggedo loses his throne, he continues to think of himself as king and the Oz book authors politely refer to him that way. Authors Ruth Plumly Thompson and John R. Neill used the traditional spelling \\"gnome\\" so Ruggedo is the title character in Thompson's The Gnome King of Oz. In Baum's universe, the Nomes are immortal rock fairies who dwell underground. They hide jewels and precious metals in the earth, and resent the \\"upstairs people\\" who dig down for those valuables. Apparently as revenge, the Nome King enjoys keeping surface-dwellers as slaves‚Äînot for their labor but simply to have them. The Nomes' greatest fear are eggs. Upon seeing Billina, Roquat is terrified, declaring that \\"Eggs are poison to Nomes!\\" He claims that any Nome who comes in contact with an egg will be weakened to the point that he can be easily destroyed unless he speaks a magic word only known to a few Nomes. Baum, however, strongly hints that the fear of eggs is unjustified, as the Scarecrow repeatedly pelts him with eggs at the end of the novel, causing him no apparent harm beyond stress enough to allow Dorothy Gale to remove his Magic Belt. Sally Roesch Wagner, in her pamphlet The Wonderful Mother of Oz suggests that Matilda Joslyn Gage had made Baum aware that the egg is an important symbol of matriarchy, and that it is this that the Nomes, among whom no females are seen in any canonical text,The unpublished Bucketheads in Oz, which features author surrogates for each of its authors, features co-author Melody Grandy as a female Nome actually fear. In their first encounter with Roquat, in Ozma of Oz, Princess Ozma, Dorothy Gale, and a party from the Emerald City free the royal family of Ev from his enslavement and, for good measure, take away his magic belt. Roquat becomes so angry that he plots revenge in The Emerald City of Oz. He has his subjects dig a tunnel under the Deadly Desert while his general recruits a host of evil spirits like the Whimsies, the Growleywogs, and the Phanfasms to conquer Oz. Fortunately at the moment of invasion, Ozma wishes (using her magic belt) for a large amount of dust to appear in the tunnel. Roquat and his allies thirstily taste the Water of Oblivion and forget everything where Roquat forgets his enmity and his name. Tik-Tok of Oz reintroduces the Nome King with his new name, all the Nomes, Whimsies, Growleywogs, and Phanfasms having forgotten the old one and old resentments. Using some personal magic, he has enslaved the Shaggy Man's brother, a miner from Colorado. Shaggy, with the help of Betsy Bobbin, the Oogaboo army, some of Dorothy's old friends, and Quox the dragon, conquer the Nome King again and Tititi-Hoochoo the Great Jinjin expels him from his kingdom, placing Chief Steward Kaliko on the throne. In Rinkitink in Oz, which is a revision of a lost 1905 novel titled King Rinkitink, which, had it been published, would have been the original character's debut, Kaliko behaves much like his former master. In The Magic of Oz, the exile Ruggedo meets the young enchanter Kiki Aru and plans to destroy Oz again. He gets into the country without Ozma's knowledge, creating havoc. However, he again drinks of the Water of Oblivion, and to stop him ever going bad again Ozma settles him in the Emerald City. Soon after taking over the Oz series, Ruth Plumly Thompson brought back Ruggedo, his memory and rancor restored and living imprisoned under the city. Finding a box of mixed magic in Kabumpo in Oz, he grows into a giant and runs away with Ozma's royal palace on his head. He is placed on a Runaway Land which runs out to the Nonestic Ocean and strands him on an island. In The Gnome King of Oz, he is helped off the island by Peter Brown, an athletic boy from Philadelphia, making his first trip to Oz. He gets hit with the Silence Stone and is rendered mute. As in Ozma of Oz, Ruggedo is quite friendly when he thinks he is going to get his way. After threatening the Emerald City utilizing a Cloak of Invisibility, he is hit with a Silence Stone and immediately struck dumb. In Pirates in Oz, the dumb Ruggedo finds a town in the Land of Ev called Menankypoo, whose people speak with words across their foreheads and seek a dumb king. Peter, Pigasus and Captain Samuel Salt aid in his defeat and he is transformed into a jug. In Handy Mandy in Oz, the Wizard of Wutz, the handsome but cruel King of the Silver Mountain, restored Ruggedo's proper form. At the end of that book, Himself the Elf transforms both of them into cacti, so that they can never make trouble again. Ruggedo made no further appearances in the original Oz series, but his further adventures have been written in several later books (some of which harmonize with one another; others which are contradictory). The Nome King and the Gnome King Much fan discussion has revolved around the identity of The Gnome King in Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, a jolly rock dweller who does not believe in giving, but only in even exchange. His gnomes watch over the rocks in the Forest of Burzee and make sleigh bells for each of Santa Claus's ten reindeer that he gives in exchange for toys for his children. An editor's note to Judy Pike's article \\"The Decline and Fall of the Nome King\\" conjectures that the Gnome King is the Nome King's father.The Baum Bugle, Christmas 1969 Analysis Concerning the original depiction of the Nome King by L. Frank Baum, essayist Suzanne Rahn has suggested that he was a \\"distinctly American kind of monarch\\". Rather than a traditional king, the Nome King was more of an industrial capitalist. His power resided in controlling a monopoly. Rahn compares the king to industrialists Andrew Carnegie (1835‚Äì1919), J. P. Morgan (1837-1913), and John D. Rockefeller (1839‚Äì1937).Tuerk (2007), p. 59-76 Richard Tuerk expands this theory to include the other Nome King, Kaliko. In Rinkitink in Oz (1916), Kaliko says to his allies Queen Cor and King Gos: \\"as a matter of business policy we powerful Kings must stand together and trample the weaker ones under our feet\\". In this case, Baum makes his replacement Nome king sound like a stereotypical capitalist from his time period.Tuerk (2007), p. 59-76 According to Jack Zipes, the Gnome King represents materialist greed. He is driven by a lust for power for the sake of power.Zipes (2006), p. 105-137 Once defeated, the King gains a new sinister motivation, revenge. He and his allies want to enslave people to attain wealth and power. Oz is Baum's version of the utopia and the Nome King strives to undermine this utopian civilization.Zipes (2006), p. 105-137 Zipes believes that Baum was against any kind of violence. In The Emerald City of Oz (1910), the Nome King's invasion of Oz is therefore defeated in a non-violent way. Baum invented a fountain filled with the water of oblivion. A single sip of this water makes the drinker forget everything, including any evil intentions. The would-be invaders of Oz drink from the fountain, forget everything, and return home.Zipes (2006), p. 105-137 Zipes argues that Baum was not going for a message of turning the other cheek. He was aware that if one uses the same methods as one's enemies, one risks becoming like them. If the defenders of Oz became cutthroat and militant like the Nome King and his forces, this would have tarnished the spirit and principles of Oz. So their victory, as orchestrated by Ozma is using a different method, oblivion. The method is creative, humane, and humanitarian.Zipes (2006), p. 105-137 Gore Vidal argued that Oz represents a \\"pastoral dream\\" deriving from the ideals of Thomas Jefferson, though here the slaves have been replaced by magic and good will. The Nome King and his black magic represent a technological civilization, driven by machines and industrialization. Vidal concluded that \\"the Nome King has governed the United States for more than a century; and he shows no sign of wanting to abdicate.\\" Zipes (2006), p. 105-137 Zipes believes that Baum was essentially a fairy tale writer. He places him in a group of writers with Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì1870), John Ruskin (1819-1900), George MacDonald (1824‚Äì1905), and Oscar Wilde (1854‚Äì1900). They brought an oppositional political perspective to their fairy tales and questioned the classical fairy tales and society at large. They reached out to young readers from the upper class, the petite bourgeoisie, and the working class. The literary fairy tale was their political weapon and they preached a message of social liberation. In Zipes words': \\"Their art was a subversive symbolic act intended to illuminate concrete utopias waiting to be realized once the authoritarian rule of the Nome King could be overcome\\".Zipes (2006), p. 105-137 Rogers points that The Emerald City of Oz (1910) was supposed to be the finale of the Oz series. Following the end of the Nome King's invasion, Baum announced that the Land of Oz was forever closed from the outside world. The truth was that the writer had become tired of the series. In the preface of Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (1908), Baum humorously complained that children kept asking him for more Oz tales. He claimed that he knew of many other stories and hoped to tell them as well. In other words, he was ready to move on to other works.Rogers (2002), p. 149-175 This complain also appeared in The Road to Oz (1909), where he hinted at a coming finale to the series. In this novel, the Nome King has lost all traces of being jolly and good-humored. He has long been stewing over his defeat and the loss of his magic belt. He feels nothing but a constant anger, which has destroyed his own capacity to feel happiness and makes his subjects miserable as well. The King himself points that he is now angry morning, noon, and night. He sees his situation as monotonous and preventing him from gaining any pleasure in life. Rogers observes that the King now resembles any number of historical rulers. He has become an irresponsible tyrant, and is driven only by malice. He also resembles a naughty child given to impotent rages. He starts the book by storming and raving \\"all by himself\\". He walks up and down in his jewel- studded cavern and gets angrier all the time. He also turns his anger towards his own subjects, when they disagree with him. He punishes them by throwing them away, though Baum does not really explain the meaning of this punishment. Rogers suggests that it sounds \\"mysteriously horrible\\". Despite Baum's intentions to end the Oz series, he eventually returned to it. He continued writing it from 1912 until his death in 1919. His motivations for returning to it were the readers' continued demand for new stories, his financial need for commercially successful stories, and his own fascination with the world of Oz.Zipes (2007), p. 216-217 In this second period of Oz, Oz becomes a \\"socialist paradise\\". The threats to it are genetic experimentation and abuse of magic. The Nome King returns in Tik-Tok of Oz (1914), where he represents cruel oppression.Zipes (2007), p. 216-217 Jason M. Bell and Jessica Bell trace the slavery and emancipation theme in the Oz tales to L. Frank Baum (1856‚Äì 1919) own childhood. As a child, Baum experienced the American Civil War (1861-1865) and the consequent Abolition of slavery in the United States. The heroes of the Oz tales tend to be abolitionists and strive to end slavery in any form. The villains are slave owners who seek to enslave others and institute slavery. The inevitable conflict between the two sides is a recurring theme in the Oz tales and has in their view contributed to the enduring popularity of the series.Bell (2010), p. 225-247 The Bells argue that it is no coincidence that abolitionist Dorothy Gale is from Kansas. Baum was a child during the Bleeding Kansas conflict (1854-1861). Thousands of abolitionists moved to Kansas to vote against slavery, while Border Ruffians from Missouri crossed the borders to stop them.Bell (2010), p. 225-247 The Nome King is a slave owner and a chauvinist. He is outsmarted and humiliated by Billina the hen, and literally left with egg on his face. The writers find it telling that the hyper-masculine Nomes and their King are terrified of feminine eggs.Bell (2010), p. 225-247 In other media The Nome King was first played by Paul de Dupont in The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays (1908). John Dunsmure played Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch in the stage play The Tik-Tok Man of Oz (1913), by Baum, Louis F. Gottschalk, and Victor Schertzinger, produced in Los Angeles by Oliver Morosco. In the play, he sings a duet with Polychrome titled \\"When in Trouble Come to Papa\\". As in the novel, the lack of females among Nomes causes Ruggedo to be willing to take her as wife, sister, or daughter so long as she remains to brighten his kingdom, and the song has him trying out the father option.The Tik-Tok Man of Oz Over the summer of 2007, South Coast Repertory performed a play called Time Again in Oz, featuring many familiar Oz characters, such as Roquat the Nome King, Tik-Tok, Uncle Henry, and, of course, Dorothy. Instead of being portrayed as an old man that looks like a mineral, Roquat is identified as being tall, rock-like with a boulder- like mass for his torso, and wears a large crown upon his rocky head. He controls the Nomes at will, headed by his lead Nome, Feldspar, who is very similar to Chistery, the flying monkey character from the Broadway adaptation, Wicked. The Nome King was portrayed on film by Nicol Williamson in 1985's Return to Oz which was based loosely on the books Ozma of Oz and The Marvelous Land of Oz. In that film, his rock-like nature was taken to the extreme via Will Vinton's Claymation. His personality and characterization largely stays true to how he is portrayed in the original novels, being seemingly fair and courteous to Dorothy and her companions under the belief that they will fail a game he sets up for them (in which they touch an ornament from his collection and say \\"Oz\\" simultaneously, having three chances each to do so) in order to give them a chance to locate the Scarecrow, whom the Nome King transformed into an ornament shortly after their entering of his domain. Of the group, all but Dorothy fail and are subsequently transformed also. As this occurs, the Nome King progressively becomes more organic looking in appearance, and would have most likely became completely human should Dorothy failed on her last guess (why the Nome King so desires this is never elaborated upon). It is only when she successfully locates the Scarecrow and her friends, subsequently reverting the Nome King to his original form, does he reveal a more sadistic and threatening side to his character (hinted at throughout the film in his earlier exchanges with Princess Mombi and also his Nome Messenger). Hungry for revenge, he grows to an enormous size and tries to eat the protagonists in a scene inspired by Georges M√©li√®s's The Conquest of the Pole (1912). He is eventually destroyed by ingesting the hidden Billina's chicken egg, laid in a panic by the hen (herself hiding in Jack Pumpkinhead's hollow head), since eggs are poisonous to Nomes. In Kansas, his counterpart is Dr. J.B. Worley (also portrayed by Williamson) who is a psychiatrist obsessed with machines and has an interest in electro-therapy. Dorothy was taken to his clinic when she was unable to sleep. By the end of the movie, it was mentioned by Aunt Em that Dr. Worley perished in the fire trying to save his machines. Roquat, having regained his original name, is the villain of The Oz-Wonderland War, published by DC Comics and starring Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew. Much of the story retreads material from Ozma of Oz, as he has also regained the Magic Belt, and it must be seized again. He uses Nomes that parody the Fantastic Four and the Hulk that get pelted by Easter Eggs, again to no apparent harm, as in the book. Michael G. Ploog, who was a conceptual artist of Return to Oz, wrote and illustrated a graphic novel based on The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus in which the Gnome King looked like the Nome King's likeness in the film, but whose function was greatly expanded from the novel to be the ruler of all the Immortals. In L. Sprague de Camp's Harold Shea series he teams his protagonist with the Nome King in \\"Sir Harold and the Gnome King.\\" In Bill Willingham's Vertigo comic book series Fables, the Nome King has sided with the Adversary and is now the ruler of Oz. He is later deposed in an uprising led by former Fabletown resident Bufkin, one of the winged monkeys native to Oz.Fables #149 In the comic book The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles #1 (2006), Ruggedo is coerced by a new Witch to bring the Jabberwocky creature to life. In the novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, the Nome King is alluded to once, along with other underground threats believed by the citizens of Wicked's Oz to be mere legend. It is not officially stated whether the Nome King, or other figures undeniably real in Baum's Oz such as Lurline, actually exist in Maguire's Oz. In Blade: Trinity, Zoe is read the Oz books by her mother and she later compares Drake to the Nome King in that he is bad simply because he has never tried to be good. In Emerald City Confidential, the Nome King is now a bartender and is mostly reformed (although he is not above using illegal magic to gain back his fortune). Sherwood Smith's novels The Emerald Wand of Oz and Trouble Under Oz feature Ruggedo's son, Prince Rikiki, who aspires to regain his father's kingdom. The Nome King appears in Dorothy and the Witches of Oz played by professional wrestler Al Snow. He is among the villains that accompanies the Wicked Witch of the West in her attack on Earth. During the climax of the film, the Nome King fights the Tin Man and is defeated by him. The Nome King appears in the comic series Fables. He is the current ruler of that land, as well as many of the surrounding kingdoms and Imperial districts. Nome King attended the Imperial conference called after the destruction of the magic grove and was positively delighted by the plans outlined by the Snow Queen for the effective genocide of the mundane population. He did feel, however, that the plan could be improved with his assistance, feeling that he had many minions that could be of great use. In the wake of the fall of the Adversary's Empire, the Nome King creates his own pan-Ozian empire. He was killed during Bufkin's revolution when the Nome King's own hanging rope magically came to life and snapped its master's head off. The Nome King appears in Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz voiced by Jason Alexander. He has taken over the Emerald City, captured Glinda and Tuffy, and took Glinda's wand, and now he wants to destroy Dorothy and seize her ruby slippers. Since his great fear of the Wizard has kept him underground, Dorothy and her friends journey to Topeka to get the Wizard to return to Oz and set everything straight. The Nome King is defeated when he falls under a dancing spell and loses the Ruby Slippers when Tom and Jerry try to keep him from falling into a bottomless pit. His Kansas counterpart is Mr. Bibb who is the neighbor of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. He files a lawsuit claiming that the twister released some of the Gale pigs who then plundered his prize watermelon patch. He takes the animals away unless Aunt Em, Uncle Henry and their farmhands can get jobs to get the money to keep their farm animals in twenty-four hours. By the end of the film, Dorothy, Toto, Tom, and Jerry use the potion the Wizard gave them to help pay off Mr. Bibb and have him cancel his lawsuit against the Gale farm. The Nome King appears in the season one finale of Emerald City portrayed by Julian Bleach. He appears as a flayed man trapped by Mistress East in the Prison of the Abject, possibly even the first to be imprisoned there. Dorothy Gale frees him in her search of someone able to control the stone giants. He manages to find his skin and puts it back on, before growing bat-like wings and flying to the Emerald City. While his name isn't revealed, it appears he is a form of the so-called \\"Beast Forever\\" that the people of Oz are afraid of.

He landed at the port of Coquimbo in Chile and spent two years in Valpara√≠so and Santiago, studying Spanish. Later he moved South to the Bio-Bio where he met some loncos (Mapuche tribal leaders).

He sent copies of the constitution of his kingdom to Chilean newspapers and El Mercurio published a portion of it on 29 December 1860. Then he returned to Valpara√≠so to wait for the representatives of the Chilean government. They ignored him. He also attempted to involve the French government in his idea, but the French consul, after making some inquiries, came to the conclusion that de Tounens was insane. He returned to Araucan√≠a where many Mapuche tribes were again preparing to fight the incursions of the Chilean Army during the occupation of Araucan√≠a. The supposed founding of the Kingdom of Araucan√≠a and Patagonia led to the Occupation of Araucan√≠a by Chilean forces. Chilean president Jos√© Joaqu√≠n P√©rez authorized Cornelio Saavedra Rodr√≠guez, commander of the Chilean troops, to invade Araucan√≠a.

Antoine de Tounens published his memoirs in 1863. In 1869, he returned to Araucan√≠a, via Buenos Aires. The Mapuche were surprised to see him because Chileans had told them that they had executed him. De Tounens proceeded to reorganize his realm and again attracted the attention of the Chilean authorities. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra Rodr√≠guez promised a reward for his head but the Mapuche decided to defend their unusual ally. Without proper funds in 1871 he had to return to France, where he published a second set of his memoirs. He also founded an Araucanian newspaper La Corona de Acero (\\"The Steel Crown\\"). In 1872, he proclaimed that he was seeking a bride so that he might sire an heir; indeed, the next year, he wrote to tell his brother that he intended to marry a \\"mademoiselle de Percy\\", but there is no evidence that he ever did. In 1874, he tried again to return to his kingdom, this time with some arms and ammunition he was able to gather with the feeble support of a few entrepreneurs in Europe. Because he was persona non grata in Chile, he traveled with a false passport. However, he was recognized as soon as he landed in Bah√≠a Blanca (on the Argentine coast) in July 1874, and was summarily deported to France. He tried to return again in 1876. However, local settlers robbed him on his way to Patagonia and handed him over to Chilean authorities. He also fell ill and had to go through an operation to survive. His health did not allow him to continue his journey and he had to return to France. On 28 August 1873 the Criminal Court of Paris ruled that Antoine de Tounens, first king of Araucania and Patagonia did not justify his status of sovereign. Antoine de Tounens died in misery on 17 September 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. Antoine de Tounens had no children but since his death in 1878, some French citizens without familial relations declared themselves to be pretenders to the throne of Araucania and Patagonia. Whether the Mapuche themselves accept this, or are even aware of it, is unclear. The pretenders to the throne of Araucania and Patagonia are called monarchs and sovereigns of fantasy, \\"having only fanciful claims to a kingdom without legal existence and having no international recognition\\".

Pre- Independence role He led the group called \\"Thirty-Three Orientals\\" during Uruguay's Declaration of Independence from Brazil in 1825. His leadership of this group has taken on somewhat mythic proportions in popular Uruguayan historiography. Post-Independence career After Uruguay's independence in 1825, Lavalleja sought the presidency as a rival to Fructuoso Rivera in 1830, who won. In protest to his loss, Lavalleja staged revolts. He was part of a triumvirate chosen in 1852 to govern Uruguay, but died shortly after his accession to power. Historical legacy Lavalleja is remembered as a rebel who led the fight against Brazil. But as one of the major figures in early, post-independence Uruguayan history he is identified as a skilled but reactionary warrior who contributed to the culture of intermittent civil war which dogged Uruguay for much of the 19th century.

Repeated injuries, chronic inflammation and repair are susceptible to fibrosis where an accidental excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, such as the collagen is produced by fibroblasts, leading to the formation of a permanent fibrotic scar. In response to injury, this is called scarring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, this is called a fibroma. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can interfere with or totally inhibit the normal architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing.Glossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ Defined by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected tissue, it is in essence an exaggerated wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function. Physiology Fibrosis is similar to the process of scarring, in that both involve stimulated fibroblasts laying down connective tissue, including collagen and glycosaminoglycans. The process is initiated when immune cells such as macrophages release soluble factors that stimulate fibroblasts. The most well characterized pro-fibrotic mediator is TGF beta, which is released by macrophages as well as any damaged tissue between surfaces called interstitium. Other soluble mediators of fibrosis include CTGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukin 10 (IL-10). These initiate signal transduction pathways such as the AKT/mTOR and SMAD pathways that ultimately lead to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, which deposit extracellular matrix into the surrounding connective tissue. This process of tissue repair is a complex one, with tight regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and degradation ensuring maintenance of normal tissue architecture. However, the entire process, although necessary, can lead to a progressive irreversible fibrotic response if tissue injury is severe or repetitive, or if the wound healing response itself becomes deregulated. Anatomical location Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, typically as a result of inflammation or damage, and examples include: Micrograph showing cirrhosis of the liver.

Signs and symptoms often include itching, scaling, cracking and redness. In rare cases the skin may blister. Athlete's foot fungus may infect any part of the foot, but most often grows between the toes. The next most common area is the bottom of the foot. The same fungus may also affect the nails or the hands. It is a member of the group of diseases known as tinea. Athlete's foot is caused by a number of different fungi, including species of Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum. The condition is typically acquired by coming into contact with infected skin, or fungus in the environment. Common places where the fungi can survive are around swimming pools and in locker rooms. They may also be spread from other animals. Usually diagnosis is made based on signs and symptoms; however, it can be confirmed either by culture or seeing hyphae using a microscope. Some methods of prevention include avoiding walking barefoot in public showers, keeping the toenails short, wearing big enough shoes, and changing socks daily. When infected, the feet should be kept dry and clean and wearing sandals may help. Treatment can be either with antifungal medication applied to the skin such as clotrimazole or for persistent infections antifungal medication that are taken by mouth such as terbinafine. The use of the cream is typically recommended for four weeks. Athlete's foot was first medically described in 1908. Globally, athlete's foot affects about 15% of the population. Males are more often affected than females. It occurs most frequently in older children or younger adults. Historically it is believed to have been a rare condition, that became more frequent in the 1900s due to the greater use of shoes, health clubs, war, and travel.  Signs and symptoms  Athlete's foot Athlete's foot is divided into four categories or presentations: chronic interdigital athlete's foot, plantar (chronic scaly) athlete's foot (aka \\"moccasin foot\\"), acute ulcerative tinea pedis, and vesiculobullous athlete's foot. \\"Interdigital\\" means between the toes. \\"Plantar\\" here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders. Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture. A vesiculobullous disease is a type of mucocutaneous disease characterized by vesicles and bullae (blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5‚Äì10 mm and bulla being larger than 5‚Äì10 mm, depending upon what definition is used). Athlete's foot occurs most often between the toes (interdigital), with the space between the fourth and fifth digits most commonly afflicted. Cases of interdigital athlete's foot caused by Trichophyton rubrum may be symptomless, it may itch, or the skin between the toes may appear red or ulcerative (scaly, flaky, with soft and white if skin has been kept wet), with or without itching. An acute ulcerative variant of interdigital athlete's foot caused by T. mentagrophytes is characterized by pain, maceration of the skin, erosions and fissuring of the skin, crusting, and an odor due to secondary bacterial infection. Plantar athlete's foot (moccasin foot) is also caused by T. rubrum which typically causes asymptomatic, slightly erythematous plaques (areas of redness of the skin) to form on the plantar surface (sole) of the foot that are often covered by fine, powdery hyperkeratotic scales. The vesiculobullous type of athlete's foot is less common and is usually caused by T. mentagrophytes and is characterized by a sudden outbreak of itchy blisters and vesicles on an erythematous base, usually appearing on the sole of the foot. This subtype of athlete's foot is often complicated by secondary bacterial infection by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. = Complications = As the disease progresses, the skin may crack, leading to bacterial skin infection and inflammation of the lymphatic vessels.The Merck Manual Professional Edition tinea pedis page . Retrieved 16 January 2015. If allowed to grow for too long, athlete's foot fungus may spread to infect the toenails,National Health Service webpage on Athlete's Foot . Retrieved 14 January 2015. feeding on the keratin in them, a condition called onychomycosis. Because athlete's foot may itch, it may also elicit the scratch reflex, causing the host to scratch the infected area before they realize it. Scratching can further damage the skin and worsen the condition by allowing the fungus to more easily spread and thrive. The itching sensation associated with athlete's foot can be so severe that it may cause hosts to scratch vigorously enough to inflict excoriations (open wounds), which are susceptible to bacterial infection. Further scratching may remove scabs, inhibiting the healing process. Scratching infected areas may also spread the fungus to the fingers and under the fingernails. If not washed away soon enough, it can infect the fingers and fingernails, growing in the skin and in the nails (not just underneath). After scratching, it can be spread to wherever the person touches, including other parts of the body and to one's environment. Scratching also causes infected skin scales to fall off into one's environment, leading to further possible spread. When athlete's foot fungus or infested skin particles spread to one's environment (such as to clothes, shoes, bathroom, etc.) whether through scratching, falling, or rubbing off, not only can they infect other people, they can also reinfect (or further infect) the host they came from. For example, infected feet infest one's socks and shoes which further expose the feet to the fungus and its spores when worn again. The ease with which the fungus spreads to other areas of the body (on one's fingers) poses another complication. When the fungus is spread to other parts of the body, it can easily be spread back to the feet after the feet have been treated. And because the condition is called something else in each place it takes hold (e.g., tinea corporis (ringworm) or tinea cruris (jock itch), persons infected may not be aware it is the same disease. Some individuals may experience an allergic response to the fungus called an id reaction in which blisters or vesicles can appear in areas such as the hands, chest, and arms. Treatment of the underlying infection typically results in the disappearance of the id reaction.  Causes  Athlete's foot is a form of dermatophytosis (fungal infection of the skin), caused by dermatophytes, fungi (most of which are mold) which inhabit dead layers of skin and digest keratin. Dermatophytes are anthropophilic, meaning these parasitic fungi prefer human hosts. Athlete's foot is most commonly caused by the molds known as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, but may also be caused by Epidermophyton floccosum. Most cases of athlete's foot in the general population are caused by T. rubrum; however, the majority of athlete's foot cases in athletes are caused by T. mentagrophytes. = Transmission = According to the UK's National Health Service, \\"Athlete‚Äôs foot is very contagious and can be spread through direct and indirect contact.\\"National Health Service's webpage on Athlete's Foot causes The disease may spread to others directly when they touch the infection. People can contract the disease indirectly by coming into contact with contaminated items (clothes, towels, etc.) or surfaces (such as bathroom, shower, or locker room floors). The fungi that cause athlete's foot can easily spread to one's environment. Fungi rub off of fingers and bare feet, but also travel on the dead skin cells that continually fall off the body. Athlete's foot fungi and infested skin particles and flakes may spread to socks, shoes, clothes, to other people, pets (via petting), bed sheets, bathtubs, showers, sinks, counters, towels, rugs, floors, and carpets. When the fungus has spread to pets, it can subsequently spread to the hands and fingers of people who pet them. If a pet frequently gnaws upon itself, it might not be fleas it is reacting to, it may be the insatiable itch of tinea. One way to contract athlete's foot is to get a fungal infection somewhere else on the body first. The fungi causing athlete's foot may spread from other areas of the body to the feet, usually by touching or scratching the affected area, thereby getting the fungus on the fingers, and then touching or scratching the feet. While the fungus remains the same, the name of the condition changes based on where on the body the infection is located. For example, the infection is known as tinea corporis (\\"ringworm\\") when the torso or limbs are affected or tinea cruris (jock itch or dhobi itch) when the groin is affected. Clothes (or shoes), body heat, and sweat can keep the skin warm and moist, just the environment the fungus needs to thrive. = Risk factors = Besides being exposed to any of the modes of transmission presented above, there are additional risk factors that increase one's chance of contracting athlete's foot. Persons who have had athlete's foot before are more likely to become infected than those who have not. Adults are more likely to catch athlete's foot than children. Men have a higher chance of getting athlete's foot than women.Mayo Clinic website, Athlete's Foot Risk Factors People with diabetes or weakened immune systems are more susceptible to the disease. HIV/AIDS hampers the immune system and increases the risk of acquiring athlete's foot. Hyperhidrosis (abnormally increased sweating) increases the risk of infection and makes treatment more difficult.The Merck Manual Professional Edition. Tinea Pedis  Diagnosis  Microscopic view of cultured athlete's foot fungus When visiting a doctor, the basic diagnosis procedure applies. This includes checking the patient's medical history and medical record for risk factors, a medical interview during which the doctor asks questions (such as about itching and scratching), and a physical examination. Athlete's foot can usually be diagnosed by visual inspection of the skin and by identifying less obvious symptoms such as itching of the affected area. If the diagnosis is uncertain, direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation of a skin scraping (known as a KOH test) can confirm the diagnosis of athlete's foot and help rule out other possible causes, such as candidiasis, pitted keratolysis, erythrasma, contact dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis. Dermatophytes known to cause athlete's foot will demonstrate multiple septate branching hyphae on microscopy. A Wood's lamp (black light), although useful in diagnosing fungal infections of the scalp (tinea capitis), is not usually helpful in diagnosing athlete's foot, since the common dermatophytes that cause this disease do not fluoresce under ultraviolet light.  Prevention  There are several preventive foot hygiene measures that can prevent athlete's foot and reduce recurrence. Some of these include keeping the feet dry, clipping toenails short; using a separate nail clipper for infected toenails; using socks made from well-ventilated cotton or synthetic moisture wicking materials (to soak moisture away from the skin to help keep it dry); avoiding tight-fitting footwear, changing socks frequently; and wearing sandals while walking through communal areas such as gym showers and locker rooms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \\"Nails should be clipped short and kept clean. Nails can house and spread the infection.\\"Centers for Disease Control webpage on Athlete's Foot . Retrieved 11 January 2015. Recurrence of athlete's foot can be prevented with the use of antifungal powder on the feet. The fungi (molds) that cause athlete's foot require warmth and moisture to survive and grow. There is an increased risk of infection with exposure to warm, moist environments (e.g., occlusive footwear‚Äîshoes or boots that enclose the feet) and in shared humid environments such as communal showers, shared pools, and treatment tubs. Chlorine bleach is a disinfectant and common household cleaner that kills mold. Cleaning surfaces with a chlorine bleach solution prevents the disease from spreading from subsequent contact. Cleaning bathtubs, showers, bathroom floors, sinks, and counters with bleach helps prevent the spread of the disease, including reinfection. Keeping socks and shoes clean (using bleach in the wash) is one way to prevent fungi from taking hold and spreading. Avoiding the sharing of boots and shoes is another way to prevent transmission. Athlete's foot can be transmitted by sharing footwear with an infected person. Hand-me-downs and purchasing used shoes are other forms of shoe-sharing. Not sharing also applies to towels, because, though less common, fungi can be passed along on towels, especially damp ones.  Treatment  Athlete's foot resolves without medication (resolves by itself) in 30‚Äì40% of cases.Over-the- Counter Foot Remedies (American Family Physician) Topical antifungal medication consistently produces much higher rates of cure. Conventional treatment typically involves thoroughly washing the feet daily or twice daily, followed by the application of a topical medication. Because the outer skin layers are damaged and susceptible to reinfection, topical treatment generally continues until all layers of the skin are replaced, about 2‚Äì6 weeks after symptoms disappear. Keeping feet dry and practicing good hygiene (as described in the above section on prevention) is crucial for killing the fungus and preventing reinfection. Treating the feet is not always enough. Once socks or shoes are infested with fungi, wearing them again can reinfect (or further infect) the feet. Socks can be effectively cleaned in the wash by adding bleach or by washing in water 60 ¬∞C (140 ¬∞F). Washing with bleach may help with shoes, but the only way to be absolutely certain that one cannot contract the disease again from a particular pair of shoes is to dispose of those shoes. To be effective, treatment includes all infected areas (such as toenails, hands, torso, etc.). Otherwise, the infection may continue to spread, including back to treated areas. For example, leaving fungal infection of the nail untreated may allow it to spread back to the rest of the foot, to become athlete's foot once again. Allylamines such as terbinafine are considered more efficacious than azoles for the treatment of athlete's foot. Severe or prolonged fungal skin infections may require treatment with oral antifungal medication. = Topical treatments = There are many topical antifungal drugs useful in the treatment of athlete's foot including: miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid. The fungal infection may be treated with topical antifungal agents, which can take the form of a spray, powder, cream, or gel. Topical application of an antifungal cream such as butenafine once daily for one week or terbinafine once daily for two weeks is effective in most cases of athlete's foot and is more effective than application of miconazole or clotrimazole. Plantar-type athlete's foot is more resistant to topical treatments due to the presence of thickened hyperkeratotic skin on the sole of the foot. Keratolytic and humectant medications such as urea, salicyclic acid (Whitfield's ointment), and lactic acid are useful adjunct medications and improve penetration of antifungal agents into the thickened skin. Topical glucocorticoids are sometimes prescribed to alleviate inflammation and itching associated with the infection. A solution of 1% potassium permanganate dissolved in hot water is an alternative to antifungal drugs. Potassium permanganate is a salt and a strong oxidizing agent. = Oral treatments = For severe or refractory cases of athlete's foot oral terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin. Fluconazole or itraconazole may also be taken orally for severe athlete's foot infections. The most commonly reported adverse effect from these medications is gastrointestinal upset. Epidemiology Globally, fungal infections affect about 15% of the population and 20% of adults. Athlete's foot is common in individuals who wear unventilated (occlusive) footwear, such as rubber boots or vinyl shoes. Countries and regions where going barefoot is more common experience much lower rates of athlete's foot than do populations which habitually wear shoes; as a result, the disease has been called \\"a penalty of civilization\\". Studies have demonstrated that men are infected 2‚Äì4 times more often than women.

He founded an experimental farm at his home at Rothamsted Manor that eventually became Rothamsted Research, where he developed a superphosphate that would mark the beginnings of the chemical fertilizer industry.  Life  John Bennet Lawes was born at Rothamsted in modern-day Harpenden near St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 28 December 1814, the only son of John Bennet Lawes, owner of the Rothamsted estate and lord of the manor of Rothamsted. His father died when he was eight years old, so he was raised mostly by his mother Marianne. He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, although he didn't graduate. Even before leaving Oxford in 1832, Lawes had begun to interest himself in growing various medicinal plants on the Rothamsted estates, which he inherited from his father upon his death in 1822. Around 1837, he began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field in order to free farmers from relying on animals to produce fertilizer. In 1839, an ostrich belonging to him escaped Rothamsted and caused a bit of property damage, although the only person it hurt was the first one to try and capture it. In 1842, he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid, and thus initiated the artificial manure industry. In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of Joseph Henry Gilbert, with whom he experimented for more than half a century in raising crops and feeding animals, activities which have rendered Rothamsted famous to scientific agriculturists. In 1854, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, which in 1867 bestowed a Royal Medal on Lawes and Gilbert jointly, and in 1882 he was awarded the title of baronet. He died in 1900, passing his manor to his son Charles, and is buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church, Harpenden with his wife Caroline (n√©e Fountaine) Lawes (1822-1895). Headstone of Sir John Bennet Lawes (1814-1900) and his wife Caroline (n√©e Fountaine) Lawes (1822-1895)  Legacy  In 1889, Lawes took measures to ensure the continued existence of the Rothamsted experimental farm by setting aside money solely for that purpose and constituting the Lawes Agricultural Trust. Rothamsted Experimental Station is the oldest agricultural research facility in the world. In Harpenden, Sir John Lawes School is named after him. The locality of Lawes, Queensland, in Australia is named after him. The main feature of that locality is the University of Queensland Gatton Campus which specialises in agriculture.

The fandom interacts online as well as offline through activities such as fan conventions, participating in cosplay, tours of iconic landmarks relevant to the books and production of the films, and parties held for the midnight release of each book and film. By the fourth Harry Potter book, the legions of fans had grown so large that considerable security measures were taken to ensure that no book was purchased before the official release date. Harry Potter is considered one of the few four-quadrant, multi-generation spanning franchises that exist today, despite Rowling's original marketing of the books to tweens and teens. Pottermania Borders bookstore for their copy of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Lumos spell Pottermania is an informal term first used around 1999 describing the craze Harry Potter fans have had over the series. Fans held midnight parties to celebrate the release of the final four books at bookstores which stayed open on the night leading into the date of the release. In 2005, Entertainment Weekly listed the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as one of \\"Entertainment's Top Moments\\" of the previous 25 years. Diehard fans of the series are called \\"Potterheads\\". Some even theme their weddings around Harry Potter. A Bridal Guide featured two real weddings soon before the release of the final movie, which quickly spread through the fandom via Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. The craze over the series was referenced in Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel The Devil Wears Prada as well as its 2006 film adaptation. In the story, the protagonist Andrea Sachs is ordered to retrieve two copies of the next installment in the series for her boss's twins before they are published so that they can be privately flown to France, where the twins and their mother are on holiday.

Fan sites There are many fan web sites about Harry Potter on the Internet, the oldest ones dating to about 1997 or 1998. J. K. Rowling has an open relationship with her fan base, and since 2004 periodically hands out a \\"fan site award\\" on her official web site. The first site to receive the award was Immeritus, a fan site mostly devoted to Sirius Black, and about which Rowling wrote, \\"I am so proud of the fact that a character, whom I always liked very much, though he never appeared as much more than a brooding presence in the books, has gained a passionate fan-club.\\" In 2004, after Immeritus, Rowling bestowed the honour upon four sites. The first was Godric's Hollow; for some time however, the site's domain name was occupied by advertisers and its content was lost and there is no further record on Rowling's site that Godric's Hollow ever received the award, although in 2010 the website came back online again albeit with a lot of content missing. The next site was the Harry Potter Lexicon, an online encyclopedia Rowling has admitted to visiting while writing away from home rather than buying a copy of her books in a store. She called it \\"for the dangerously obsessive; my natural home.\\" The third site of 2004 was MuggleNet, a web site featuring the latest news in the Potter world, among editorials, forums, and a podcast. Rowling wrote when giving the award, \\"It's high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet,\\" and listed all the features she loved, including \\"the pretty-much-exhaustive information on all books and films.\\" The last site was HPANA, the first fan site Rowling ever visited, \\"faster off the mark with Harry Potter news than any other site\\" Rowling knows, and \\"fantastically user-friendly.\\" In 2005, only The Leaky Cauldron was honored. In Rowling's words, \\"it is about the worst kept secret on this website that I am a huge fan of The Leaky Cauldron,\\" which she calls a \\"wonderfully well designed mine of accurate information on all things Harry Potter.\\" On another occasion, Rowling has called the Leaky Cauldron her \\"favourite fan site.\\" In 2006, the Brazilian website Potterish was the only site honoured, in recognition of its \\"style, [its] Potter-expertise and [its] responsible reporting.\\" In May 2007, Harry Potter Fan Zone received the award. Rowling recognized the insightful editorials as well as praised the site for its young and dedicated staff. In December 2007, the award went to The Harry Potter Alliance, a campaign that seeks to end discrimination, genocide, poverty, AIDS, global warming, and other \\"real-world Dark Arts\\", relating these problems to the books. Rowling called the project \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"most inspirational\\", and paralleled its mission to \\"the values for which Dumbledore's Army fought in the books\\". In an article about her in Time, Rowling expressed her gratefulness at the site's successful work raising awareness and sign-up levels among anti-genocide coalitions. At one time, Warner Bros., which owns the rights to Harry Potter and its affiliates, tried to shut down the sites. The unsuccessful attempt eventually led to their inviting the webmasters of the top sites to premieres of the films and tours of the film sets, because of their close connection with the fans. Warner Bros. executives have acknowledged that many fans are disappointed that certain elements of the books are left out, but not trying to avoid criticism, \\"bringing the fan sites into the process is what we feel is really important.\\" These fan sites contain news updates into the world of the books, films, and film cast members through the use of forums, image galleries, or video galleries. They also host user-submitted creations, such as fan art or fan fiction. =Podcasts= The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular, often weekly, insight to the latest discussion in the fandom. Apple Inc. has featured two of the podcasts, MuggleCast and PotterCast. Both have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top 50 favorite podcasts. At the 2006 Podcast Awards, when MuggleCast and PotterCast each received two nominations for the same two categories, the two podcasts teamed up and requested listeners vote for PotterCast in the Best Entertainment category and MuggleCast in the People's Choice category. Both podcasts won these respective categories. MuggleCast, hosted by MuggleNet staffers, was created in August 2005, not long after the release of Half-Blood Prince. Topics of the first show focused on Horcruxes, \\"R.A.B.\\", the Goblet of Fire film, which was due for release two months later, and the website DumbledoreIsNotDead.com. Since then, MuggleCast has held chapter-by-chapter discussions, character analyses, and a discussion on a \\"theory of the week\\". MuggleCast has also added humour to their podcast with segments like \\"Spy on Spartz,\\" where the hosts would call MuggleNet webmaster Emerson Spartz and reveal his current location or activity with the listening audience. British staff member Jamie Lawrence tells a British joke of the week, and host Andrew Sims reads an email sent to MuggleNet with a strange request or incoherent talk (dubbed \\"Huh?! Email of the Week\\"). MuggleCast is currently the highest rated Harry Potter Podcast on the Internet. The MuggleCast website will continue to serve as a resource for other Harry Potter fans who want to rediscover the show. PotterCast was released less than two weeks after MuggleCast's first episode. Produced by The Leaky Cauldron, it differed from MuggleCast with a more structured program, including various segments and involvement of more people on the Leaky Cauldron staff compared to MuggleCast. It also was the first Potter podcast to produce regular interviews with people directly involved with the books and films. The first show featured interviews with Stuart Craig, art director of the films, as well as Bonnie Wright, who plays Ginny Weasley. PotterCast has also interviewed Matthew Lewis (the actor who portrays Neville Longbottom), Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Jamie Waylett (Vincent Crabbe), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Mike Newell (directors of the first four films), Arthur A. Levine and Cheryl Klein (editors of the books at Scholastic), and Rowling herself. The two sites are friendly rivals and have aired several combined episodes, which they call \\"The Leaky Mug\\", a separate podcast released on a separate feed from time to time. Live joint podcasts have been held in New York City, Las Vegas, and California. From time to time, hosts on one podcast will appear on their counterpart. Other notable Harry Potter podcasts include Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, in which the books are read as if they were a religious text, Witch Please, which looks at the books through a feminist lens, and Potterotica, in which actors read Harry Potter fan fiction aloud. Fan fiction Rowling has backed fan fiction stories on the Internet, stories written by fans that involve Harry Potter or other characters in the books. A March 2007 study showed that \\"Harry Potter\\" is the most searched-for fan fiction subject online. Some fans will use canon established in the books to write stories of past and future events in the Harry Potter world; others write stories that have little relation to the books other than the characters' names and the settings in which the fan fiction takes place. On FanFiction.Net, there are over 817,000, while Archive of Our Own has over 230,000 stories on Harry Potter . There are numerous websites devoted solely to Harry Potter fan fiction. Of these, according to rankings on Alexa.com, HarryPotterFanfiction.com has grown to be the most popular. A well-known work of fan fiction is The Shoebox Project, created by two LiveJournal users. Over 8500 people subscribe to the story so that they are alerted when new posts update the story. The authors' works, including this project, were featured in an article in The Wall Street Journal discussing the growth in popularity of fandoms. The current most reviewed piece of fanfiction, with over 25,000 reviews, is Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky writing under the pseudonym of Less Wrong. In 2006, the \\"popular 'bad' fanfic\\" My Immortal was posted on FanFiction.Net by user \\"Tara Gilesbie\\". It was deleted by the site's administrators in 2008, but not before amassing over eight thousand negative reviews. It spawned a number of YouTube spoofs and a number of imitators created \\"sequels\\" claiming to be the original Tara. In 2007, a web-based novel, James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing, was written by a computer animator named George Lippert. The book was written as a supplement to fill the void after Deathly Hallows, and received eventual approval from Rowling herself. Rowling has said, \\"I find it very flattering that people love the characters that much.\\" She has adopted a positive position on fan fiction, unlike authors such as Anne McCaffrey or Anne Rice who discourage fans from writing about their books and have asked sites like FanFiction.Net to remove all stories of their works, requests honored by the site. However, Rowling has been \\"alarmed by pornographic or sexually explicit material clearly not meant for kids,\\" according to Neil Blair, an attorney for her publisher. The attorneys have sent cease and desist letters to sites that host adult material. Potter fan fiction also has a large following in the slash fiction genre, stories which feature sexual relationships that do not exist in the books (shipping), often portraying homosexual pairings. Famous pairings include Harry with Draco Malfoy or Cedric Diggory, and Remus Lupin with Sirius Black. Harry Potter slash has eroded some of the antipathy towards underage sexuality in the wider slash fandom.McLelland, Mark. The World of Yaoi: The Internet, Censorship and the Global ‚ÄúBoys‚Äô Love‚Äù Fandom The Australian Feminist Law Journal, 2005. Tracey \\"T\\" Proctor, a moderator of FictionAlley.org, a Harry Potter fanfiction website, said 'I don't really get into the children's aspect of it, but rather the teachers, the adult characters. I read someone once who said, \\"If she didn't want us fantasizing about her characters, she needs to stop having these handsome men portraying them.\\" And that's the truth: It's very hard not to look at Alan Rickman [Professor Severus Snape] and Jason Isaacs [Lucius Malfoy] and not get erotic thoughts.

Retrieved on 19 February 2013. In November 2006, Jason Isaacs, who plays Lucius Malfoy in the Potter films, said that he had read fan fiction about his character and gets \\"a huge kick out of the more far-out stuff.\\" =Discussion= Prior to the publication of Deathly Hallows, much of the energy of the Potter fandom was devoted to speculation and debate about upcoming plot and character developments. To this end, clues from the earlier books and deliberate hints from J. K. Rowling (in interviews and on her website) were heavily scrutinised by fans. In particular, fan essays were published on websites such as Mugglenet (the \\"world famous editorials\\"), the Harry Potter Lexicon and The Leaky Cauldron (Scribbulus project) among others: offering theories, comment and analysis on all aspects of the series. The Yahoo discussion list Harry Potter for Grown Ups (founded in 1999) is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books. Speculation intensified with the July 2005 publication of Half-Blood Prince and the detailed post-publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron. Notably, DumbledoreIsNotDead.com sought to understand the events of the sixth book in a different way. (Rowling later confirmed, however ‚Äì on 2 August 2006 ‚Äì that Dumbledore was, in fact, dead, humorously apologising to the website as she did so.) A collection of essays, Who Killed Albus Dumbledore?: What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence, was published by Zossima Press in November 2006. Contributors included the Christian author John Granger and Joyce Odell of Red Hen Publications, whose own website contains numerous essays on the Potterverse and fandom itself. In 2006, in advance of the arrival of the seventh Potter novel, five MuggleNet staff members co-authored the reference book Mugglenet.Com's What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7: Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Falls in Love and How Will the Adventure Finally End, an anthology of unofficial fan predictions; while early in 2007, Leaky launched HarryPotterSeven.com, featuring \\"roundups and predictions from some of the most knowledgeable fans online\\" (including Steve Vander Ark of the Lexicon). Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of Deathly Hallows) included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as \\"the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference\\", as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical \\"evidence-based synopsis\\" of the seventh novel. To this day, debate and reaction to the novels and films continues on web forums (including Mugglenet's Chamber of Secrets community and TLC's Leaky Lounge). Fan film and television A 2018 Italian fan-made prequel to the series, Voldemort: Origins of the Heir, depicts the story of Tom Riddle's rise to power. The teaser trailer was released on in June 2017, receiving exceeded thirty million views in less than 48 hours on Facebook. The full movie was later released on YouTube on 13 January 2018, receiving over twelve million views in ten days. Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis is an online TV series focused on Hermione Granger's life after Hogwarts. In the show, Granger, cast as a black woman played by Ashley Romans, has broken up with Ron Weasley and moved to Los Angeles to reevaluate her life and choices. Conventions Attendees of Sectus convention in London await the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Fan conventions have been another way that the fandom has congregated. Conventions such as Prophecy, LeakyCon, Infinitus, Azkatraz, and Ascendio have maintained an academic emphasis, hosting professional keynote speakers as well as keeping the atmosphere playful and friendly. They have featured prominent members of the fandom such as Jennie Levine, owner of SugarQuill.net (Phoenix Rising, 2007); Melissa Anelli, current webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron (Phoenix Rising, 2007; Leakycon, 2009/2011/2012); Sue Upton, former Senior Editor of the Leaky Cauldron (Prophecy, 2007); Heidi Tandy, founder of Fiction Alley (Prophecy, 2007), Paul and Joe DeGeorge of the wizard rock band Harry and the Potters (along with several other more well- known Wizard Rock bands such as The Remus Lupins, The Parselmouths, Ministry of Magic, and The Whomping Willows) (see below) (Prophecy, 2007; Leakycon, 2009/2011/2012), Andrew Slack, founder of The Harry Potter Alliance, and StarKid, the cast of the fan made musicals \\"A Very Potter Musical\\", \\"A Very Potter Sequel\\", and \\"A Very Potter Senior Year\\". Still, the conventions try to attract the fandom with other fun-filled Potter-centric activities, often more interactive, such as wizarding chess, water Quidditch, a showing of the Harry Potter films, or local cultural immersions. Live podcasts are often recorded during these events, and live Wizard Rock shows have become a fairly large part of recent conventions. Members of the Harry Potter cast have been brought in for the conferences; actors such as Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Christopher Rankin (Percy Weasley), along with several others, have appeared to give live Q&A; sessions and keynote presentations about the series. In addition to fandom-specific programming, LeakyCon 2011 and 2012 have hosted LitDays (as well as incorporating the many fandoms Harry Potter fans have branched into since the ending of the series). LitDays are full of programming with authors, agents, and editors. A few key examples are John Green, author of the award-winning young adult novels The Fault in Our Stars and Looking for Alaska; Scott Westerfeld, author of the Uglies series and Leviathan; and David Levithan, author of Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist and The Lover's Dictionary. These conventions are now incorporating the recently opened theme park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter into their itinerary, built inside Universal's Island of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. At the Harry Potter fan conventions Infinitus 2010, LeakyCon 2011, and Ascendio 2012, special events were held at the theme park dedicated to the series. These are after-hours events for convention attendees who purchased tickets to experience and explore the park by themselves. The event included talks given by creators of the park, free food and butterbeer, and live wizard rock shows inside the park. Festivals In addition to conventions, Harry Potter fandom has further expanded to town festivals, including the Chestertown Harry Potter Festival (Maryland), the Chestnut Hill Harry Potter Festival (Philadelphia), Edgerton's Harry Potter Festival (Wisconsin), and the Spellbound Festival (Michigan, 2016; Ontario, 2018; New York, 2019), among others. \\"Ship debates\\" In the fandom the word \\"ship\\" and its derivatives like \\"shipping\\" or \\"shipper\\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \\"relationship.\\" The Harry Potter series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between Harry Potter and his close female friend Hermione Granger at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with Ron Weasley, close friend of both, as well as supporters of Harry ending up with Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister. Quotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \\"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\\", and were repeated on at least three different occasions). An interview with J.K. Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz (MuggleNet) and Melissa Anelli (The Leaky Cauldron) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \\"delusional\\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \\"still valued members of her readership\\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the San Francisco Chronicle. Rowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained: In a later posting on MuggleNet, Spartz explained: Rowling has continued to make references, less humorous and more, to the severity of the shipper conflicts. In one instance she has joked about trying to think of ways of proving to Emerson, when inviting him for the aforementioned interview, that it was really her and not \\"some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway\\"; In another, she has described her impression of the Harry Potter fandom's shipping debates as \\"cyber gang warfare\\". Rowling stated in an interview in February 2014 in Wonderland Magazine that she thought that realistically Hermione and Ron had \\"too much fundamental incompatibility.\\" She stated that Hermione and Ron were written together \\"as a form of wish fulfillment\\" as way to reconcile a relationship she herself was once in. She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counseling Ron and Hermione would have been all right.West, Kelly. \\"What J.K. Rowling Actually Said About Hermione's Relationships With Ron And Harry\\", Cinema Blend, 7 February 2014. Retrieved on 2 October 2014. She also went on to say in a talk at Exeter University that Harry's love for Ginny is true, thereby denying any potential canon relationship between Harry and Hermione. =Other relationships= On a less intense scale, other relationships have been doted upon in the fandom from suggestive hints or explicit statements throughout canon, such as those between Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson, Harry Potter's parents James Potter and Lily Evans, Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, or Percy Weasley and Penelope Clearwater, or Rose Granger-Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy. A potential relationship between Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood was originally dispelled by Rowling, though she later retracted this and said she noticed a slight attraction between them in Deathly Hallows. Some couples, besides Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione, have been explicitly stated in the series: Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are married in Deathly Hallows after dating throughout Half-Blood Prince.Rowling, J. K. (2007). Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (in English). London: Bloomsbury/New York City: Scholastic, et al. UK /US , chapter 8. In Half-Blood Prince, Nymphadora Tonks keeps her feelings for Remus Lupin to herself, but remains depressed when he refuses her advances; he feels that his being a werewolf would not create a safe relationship.Rowling, J. K. (2005). Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (in English). London: Bloomsbury/New York City: Scholastic, et al. UK /US , chapter 29. Tonks professes her love for him at the end of the book, and she and Lupin have been married by the beginning of Deathly Hallows and have a son 'Teddy' later in the book.Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, chapter 1. Other couples, such as Harry and Draco or Lupin and Sirius Black, are favorites among fans who read fan fiction about them. There is also debate about Lily and Severus vs. James. Roleplaying games Millikin University students at their biannual Muggle Quidditch tournament, a form of live action roleplay. Roleplaying is a central feature of the Harry Potter fandom. There are two primary forms: internet- based roleplay and live-action roleplay, or LARP. LARPing often involves re- enacting or creating an original Quidditch team. Match rules and style of play vary among fandom events, but they are generally kept as close as possible to the sport envisioned by Rowling. The 2006 Lumos symposium included a Quidditch tournament played in water. More common are ground-based games such as the handball style developed by USA Team Handball and featured at the MuggleNet- sponsored Spellbound event, as well as the Muggle Quidditch style played intramurally at Millikin University (at left). This version of quidditch has grown past intramural play, is far from LARPing, and has an international governing body, the IQA. Internet-based roleplay tries to simulate the Hogwarts experience. Many sites are forum-based, emphasizing taking classes taught by staff members in order for the players to earn points for their respective houses. Some internet-based roleplay sites go more in depth into canon and storylines, and do not specifically rely on posting as the only method for gaining house points while others have expanded to include activities such as Quidditch, dueling, and board-wide plots. Hogwarts- school.net (est. 2000), for example, is a forum-based roleplaying game which allows players to take classes, engage in extracurriculars, and also has many options for adult characters in St. Mungos, the Daily Prophet, and the Ministry of Magic. 2007 saw the launch of World of Hogwarts, a completely free MMORPG Harry Potter roleplaying game in Second Life, set ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts. Here, roleplayers can create an avatar and interact with other students, attend lessons organized by other roleplayers, play Quidditch, sit for their exams, earn and lose points for their house, visit Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley and the Forbidden Forest, get a job at the Ministry of Magic, explore several secret passages within the castle, and even immerse themselves into intricate and well-composed storyline plots that have, through time, grown into the canon rules of the game. A website created by ISO Interactive, called the Chamber of Chat is a free online interactive virtual world under a MMO format. Although not a full MMORPG format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in Pictionary and Harry Potter Trivial games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions. Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own \\"clubhouse\\". However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans' avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. \\"Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few Facebook plug-ins. The Harry Potter Virtual World is designed for fans. This give users the feeling that they are interacting in the actual 3D world. You can hang out with other students, relax in the common room, mingle at the pub, play games like Pictionary and even download cool looking wallpapers.\\" On 19 April 2007, Chamber of Chat was awarded Adobe Site of the day. Chamber of chat has also been awarded a place among the SmartFoxServer Showcase. \\"Chamber of Chat is an MMO community inspired to the magic worlds of the Harry Potter saga. The application is a great example of integration between Director/Shockwave (client) and SmartFoxServer PRO.\\". Chamber of Chat has been a long time associated branch of The Leaky network and although as part of the network with The Leaky Cauldron, Pottercast and \\"Ask Peeves\\" search engine, it was ranked number two behind Indiana Jones's TheRaider.Net out of 25 essential fansites of \\"The Best of the Web\\" by Entertainment Weekly in December 2007. Other sites use modified versions of phpBB that allow for a certain level of interactive roleplaying and are what is commonly referred to as \\"forum-based roleplaying\\". Interactive gaming can include player versus player features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and non-player characters such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \\"house\\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person. Roleplaying also occurs in long-form improvisational theater. Several American and British improv troupes are devoted to the Potter genre. These include Melbourne's Completely Improvised Potter London's Potted Potter and Los Angeles's The Show That Shall Not Be Named. Iconic landmarks tours The Glenfinnan viaduct, which the Hogwarts Express passes over when it travels to Hogwarts in the films. Some travel agencies have organised a subdivision to create tours specifically highlighting iconic landmarks in the world of Harry Potter. HP Fan Trips, offered by Beyond Boundaries Travel since 2004 in conjunction with fan site HPANA, was designed by and for fans of the series, and tours noteworthy Potter-related locations in the United Kingdom. Since 2004, they have exclusively chartered steam locomotive #5972 Olton Hall, the locomotive used in the films as the Hogwarts Express, as well as the carriages labeled as such and seen in the movies. The travel agency Your Man in Europe began hosting Magical Tours in 2006, in conjunction with fan site MuggleNet. They offer four different tours through England and Scotland. Alnwick Castle, the castle used for filming exterior shots of Hogwarts in the Potter films. These tours primarily feature locations used for shooting in the films, though some trips include a Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh, which was once Nicholson's Cafe, where Rowling wrote much of the manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and Edinburgh Castle, where Rowling read from the sixth book on the night of its release to an audience of children. Filming locations visited include Alnwick Castle, where some exterior locations of Hogwarts are shot, places in Fort William, Scotland; Glen Nevis, Scotland; the Glenfinnan viaduct; Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford and the Cloisters located within New College, Oxford. Wizard rock Harry and the Potters perform at the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, Bronx, New York. Wizard music (sometimes shorthanded as Wrock) is a musical movement dating from 2000 in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters, though it has grown internationally and has expanded to at least 750 bands.Wizrocklopedia band listings Wrock bands mostly consist of young musicians that write and perform songs about the Harry Potter universe, and these songs are often written from the point of view of a particular character in the books, usually the character who features in the band's name. If they are performing live, they may also cosplay, or dress as, that character. In contrast to mainstream bands that have some songs incorporating literary references among a wider repertoire of music (notably Led Zeppelin to The Lord of the Rings), wizard rock bands take their inspiration entirely from the Harry Potter universe. In preserving the promotion of reading, too, bands like to perform in libraries, bookstores, and schools. The bands have also performed at the fan conventions. Documentaries =We Are Wizards= We Are Wizards is a feature-length documentary by Josh Koury about the Harry Potter fandom. It features Wizard rock bands Harry and the Potters, Draco and the Malfoys, The Hungarian Horntails, and The Whomping Willows. The film also features Heather Lawver, Melissa Anelli, and Brad Neely.We Are Wizards - The Movie We Are Wizards had its World Premiere at the SXSW film festival in 2008, then traveled to 20 film festivals worldwide. The film opened theatrically in 5 cities on 14 November 2008. The film can be seen on Hulu.com, and DVD. =The Fandom Fan Diaries: Wizard's Gone W!ld= The Fandom Fan Diaries: Wizard's Gone W!ld is a documentary web series that is based on fandom submissions. The producers Miranda Marshall and Amy Henderson starting accepting video submissions in early March 2009 and plan to accept them through 2013.

The film was released in April 2008 and has screened in libraries around the country. The producers are currently negotiating broadcast and home video rights. =Proyecto Patronus= Project Patronus: magic of a generation (Proyecto Patronus: la magia de una generaci√≥n) is a Spanish documentary based on the Harry Potter saga. It covers the franchise's influence on a generation of young people, and deals with the multiple values, such as friendship, love, courage and respect, which are reflected in the books. Numerous professionals in psychology and pedagogy who have studied the significance of the saga appear. The film was released in 2016 and has screened in film festivals around Spain. Health In 2003, Dr. Howard J. Bennett coined the term \\"Hogwarts headache\\" in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine shortly after the release of the longest book in the series, Order of the Phoenix. He described it as a mild condition, a tension headache possibly accompanied by neck or wrist pains, caused by unhealthily long reading sessions of Harry Potter. The symptoms resolved themselves within days of finishing the book. His prescription of taking reading breaks was rejected by two of the patients on which he discovered this headache. Researchers at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford found in 2005 that the admission rate of children with traumatic injuries to the city's ERs plummeted on the publication weekends of both Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince. This was due to the volume of children reading Harry Potter rather than engaging in riskier outdoor activities, such as riding of bicycles and scooters, climbing trees or playing sports. The study was led by Dr. Stephen Gwilym whose paper \\"hypothesized that there is a place for a committee of safety-conscious, talented writers who could produce high quality books for the purpose of injury prevention,\\" noting a potential problem with this strategy: \\"Obviously, if children are always in reading books and not outside getting exercise, there is a long-term risk of obesity, rickets and lack of sunlight.\\" See also *Bartimaeus Sequence *Muggle  References  Waters, G.

It is a type of plate heat exchanger and can be used on many different computer components, including the central processing unit (CPU), GPU, PPU, and Northbridge chipset on the motherboard. It consists of at least two main parts; the \\"base\\",which is the area that makes contact with the device being cooled and is usually manufactured from metals with high thermal conductivity such as aluminum or copper. The second part, the \\"top\\" ensures the water is contained safely inside the water block and has connections that allow hosing to connect it with the water cooling loop. The top can be made of the same metal as the base, transparent Perspex, Delrin, Nylon, or HDPE. Most newer high-end water blocks also contain mid-plates which serve to add jet tubes, nozzles, and other flow altering devices. An exploded diagram of a simple waterblock. The base, top, and mid-plate(s) are sealed together to form a \\"block\\" with some sort of path for water to flow through. The ends of the path have inlet/outlet connectors for the tubing that connects it to the rest of the watercooling system. Early designs included spiral, zig-zag pattern or heatsink like fins to allow the largest possible surface area for heat to transfer from the device being cooled to the water. These designs generally were used because the conjecture was that maximum flow was required for high performance. Trial and error and the evolution of water block design has shown that trading flow for turbulence can often improve performance. The Storm series of water blocks is an example of this. Its jet tube mid plate and cupped base design makes it more restrictive to the flow of water than early maze designs but the increased turbulence results in a large increase in performance. Newer designs include \\"pin\\" style blocks, \\"jet cup\\" blocks, further refined maze designs, micro-fin designs, and variations on these designs. Increasingly restrictive designs have only been possible because of increases in maximum head pressure of commercially viable water pumps. A water block is better at dissipating heat than an air-cooled heatsink due to water's higher specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity. The water is usually pumped through to a radiator which allows a fan pushing air through it to take the heat created from the device and expel it into the air. A radiator is more efficient than a standard CPU or GPU heatsink/air cooler at removing heat because it has a much larger surface area. Installation of a water block is also similar to that of a heatsink, with a thermal pad or thermal grease placed between it and the device being cooled to aid in heat conduction.

Modern Chess Openings calls it the \\"Cadillac\\" or \\"Rolls Royce\\" of chess openings. The opening is named after the Polish-Argentine grandmaster Miguel Najdorf. Many players have lived by the Najdorf (notably Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, although Kasparov would often transpose into a Scheveningen). The Najdorf begins: :1. e4 c5 :2. Nf3 d6 :3. d4 cxd4 :4. Nxd4 Nf6 :5. Nc3 a6 Black's 5...a6 aims to deny the b5-square to White's knights and light-square bishop while maintaining flexible development. If Black plays 5...e5 immediately, then after 6.Bb5+ Bd7 (or 6...Nbd7 7.Nf5) 7.Bxd7+ Nbxd7 8.Nf5 and the knight on f5 is difficult to dislodge without concessions. Black usually plans a to pressure White's e4-pawn. This is often carried out by means of ...b5, ...Bb7, and placing a knight on c5, or c4 via b6.  Variations  = Main line: 6. Bg5 =  Classical Main line: 6...e6  The main move. In the early days of the Najdorf 7.Qf3 was popular, but the reply 7...h6 did not allow White to obtain any advantage. Nowadays, White players almost universally respond with the move: 7. f4. White threatens 8.e5, but Black has several options: *7... Be7 8. Qf3 and now: **8... Qc7 9. 0-0-0 Nbd7, this is called the old main line. At this point White usually responds with 10.g4 or 10.Bd3. After each of these moves there is a huge body of opening theory. **8... h6 9. Bh4 g5. This is known as the Argentine/Goteborg Variation. It was first played in round 14 of 1955 Goteborg Interzonal simultaneously by Argentine players Panno, Pilnik and Najdorf who were facing the Soviet grandmasters Geller, Spassky and Keres. The games in question proceeded as follows: 10.fxg5 Nfd7 (Black aims to route a knight to e5, and then back it up by a knight at d7 or c6) 11.Nxe6 (Efim Geller's discovery) 11...fxe6 12.Qh5+ Kf8 13.Bb5. Here Panno played 13...Ne5, while Pilnik and Najdorf chose 13...Kg7; however, all three Argentine players lost in very short order and the line was, for a while, considered refuted. In 1958 Bobby Fischer played 13...Rh7!, versus Svetozar Gligoriƒá at the Portoro≈æ Interzonal, in a critical last-round game. According to modern opening theory, this position is a draw at best for White. A 10,000 node analysis by Leela Lc0 departs from this line with 11. Bg3. Black can route the knight as intended 11... Ne5. White blockades the h pawn 12. Qh5. Black can take the g5 pawn, leading to a knights exchange 12. ... Bxg5 13. Nf3 Nxf3 14. Qxf3 *7... Qb6 one of the most popular choices at master level. **8. Qd2 the extremely complicated Poisoned Pawn Variation: 8...Qxb2 9.Rb1 (9.Nb3 is the other less common option) 9...Qa3 and here White has played both 10.f5 and 10.e5. Both lead to extremely sharp play where slightest inaccuracy is fatal for either side. Since 2006, when it was played in several high level games, 10.e5 has become very popular. From the standpoint of the theory it is regarded as White's only attempt to play for a win against the Poisoned Pawn Variation since all other variations (and that includes the other pawn move, 10.f5) have been analysed to a draw with best play. An example is the game Vallejo Pons- Kasparov, Moscow 2004, which was called \\"a model modern grandmaster draw!\\" by Kasparov himself in Revolution in the 70s (page 164). **8. Nb3 White opts for a quiet game, but Black has nothing to worry about: 8...Be7 9.Qf3 Nbd7 10.0-0-0 Qc7 where we have reached a setup very similar to that of the old main line mentioned above. However, without the d4-knight White will find it very hard to organise an attack. **8. a3 is a more challenging reply for White. It protects the pawn indirectly as 8...Qxb2 is met by 9.Na4! winning the queen. Black usually plays 8...Nc6, although 8...Nbd7 is also playable. The 8.a3 line has been seen several times at the grandmaster level recently. *7... b5 the ultra-sharp Polugaevsky Variation. (also known as Najdorf, Polugayevsky Variation) Black ignores White's threat and expands on the queenside. 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Qc7 here White either plays 10.exf6 Qe5+ 11.Be2 Qxg5 or 10.Qe2 Nfd7 11.0-0-0 Bb7. *7... Qc7 championed by Garry Kasparov before he switched to playing 7...Qb6 exclusively. *7... Nbd7 popularised by Boris Gelfand. *7... Nc6?! is risky and of a dubious theoretical reputation due to the response: 8.e5! *7... h6!? the Poisoned Pawn Deferred. This variation is very popular at the moment. The line 8.Bh4 Qb6 9.a3 was played twice in the 2016 London Chess Classic (Caruana-Nakamura and Nakamura-Vachier- Lagrave), though White won both games.  Verbeterde List: 6...Nbd7  Historically speaking, this was the usual reply until the mid-1960s, when the rejoinder 7.Bc4 put the move \\"out of business\\". Recently however, ideas have been found by some Dutch players who call this variation De Verbeterde List (\\"The Improved Stratagem\\"). The idea for Black is to postpone ...e6 in order to retain more dynamic options (for example, to play ...e7‚Äìe5 in one move). The idea was tested by Petrosian, Belov, and others, but received popular attention and developed rapidly after use by Dutch player Lody Kuling in 2007. The most important developments include: *7. f4 Qc7 8. Qf3: **8... h6 9. Bh4 e5. A setup discovered by Lody Kuling. (This variation is covered by Ufuk Tuncer and Twan Burg in New In Chess, Yearbook 102.) The idea is to gain time over ...e6 by playing ...e7‚Äìe5 in one move. Later on it turned out that 9...g5! is even better. **8... b5 is the Neo Verbeterde List. This is a new way to play the Verbeterde List. It includes fianchetting the bishop to b7. (The variation is covered by Ufuk Tuncer in New In Chess, Yearbook 101.) *7. Bc4 Qb6 This is a move introduced by Lenier Dominguez. The idea is to win a tempo by attacking b2, after which Black can finish his development beginning 8...e6. The last word on the line has not yet been given. The whole variation with 6...Nbd7 is covered in the book by ƒΩubom√≠r Ft√°ƒçnik in the chapter \\"Blood Diamond\\". *7. f4/Qe2 g6 is Grischuk's Verbeterde List, another modern way to meet both 7.f4 and 7.Qe2. The idea is to castle kingside rapidly and then start to attack with ...b5‚Äìb4, while wasting no time with the e-pawn. = English Attack: 6.Be3 = This has become the modern main line. Since the early 1990s, the English Attack, 6.Be3 followed by f3, g4, Qd2 and 0-0-0 in some order, has become extremely popular and has been intensively analysed. Four lines are then usual for Black: * The classical 6... e5. After 7.Nb3, Black usually continues 7...Be6, trying to control the d5-square. The most common move is then 8.f3, allowing White to play Qd2 next move. If White had tried to play 8.Qd2, then Black could respond with 8...Ng4. Instead White can play 7.Nf3, in which case Black's main choices are 7...Be7 and 7...Qc7. * Trying to transpose to the Scheveningen by playing 6... e6. White can either opt for the standard English Attack by playing 7.f3 or try the even sharper Hungarian Attack (also known as Perenyi Attack) by playing 7.g4. * The knight move: 6... Ng4. White continues: 7.Bg5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3 Bg7, but the nature of this position is quite different from the ones arising after 6...e6 and 6...e5, so sometimes White tries to avoid the knight jump by playing 6.f3 instead of 6.Be3. However, aside from eliminating the option to play the Hungarian Attack mentioned above, it gives Black other possibilities such as 6...Qb6 and 6...b5. * The Verbeterde List approach: 6... Nbd7. The idea of this move is to get into the English Attack while avoiding the Perenyi Attack. 7.g4 is less dangerous now because with 6...Nbd7 Black is more flexible as the bishop on c8 can attack g4 now and the knight on d7 can jump to interesting squares. = Fischer‚ÄìSozin Attack: 6.Bc4 = Introduced by Veniamin Sozin in the 1930s, this received little attention until Fischer regularly adopted it, and it was a frequent guest at the top level through the 1970s. White plays 6. Bc4 with the idea of playing against f7, so Black counters with 6...e6 7.Bb3 b5. The Sozin has become less popular because of 7...Nbd7 where Black intends to follow up with ...Nc5 later. It is possible to avoid the 7...Nbd7 option with 7.0-0, but this cuts out the aggressive possibility of castling long. = Classical/Opocensky Variation: 6.Be2 = Because of the success of various players with these variations, White often plays 6. Be2 and goes for a quieter, more positional game, whereupon Black has the option of transposing into a Scheveningen Variation by playing 6...e6 or keeping the game in Najdorf lines by playing 6...e5. Another option is to play 6...Nbd7, in the spirit of The Verbeterde List; it is for this reason that this variation is called The Verbeterde List Unlimited. = Amsterdam Variation: 6.f4 = Some lines include: *6...e5 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.a4 Be7 9.Bd3 0-0 *6...Qc7 7.Bd3 *6...e6 7.Be2 GM Daniel King recommends 6...g6 against the Amsterdam Variation, leading to a more defensive kingside pawn structure. The idea is to eventually counterattack on the g1‚Äìa7 diagonal with a move like ...Qb6, preventing White from castling. An example line would be 6...g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.a4 Nc6 (note 8...Nc6 as opposed to the usual Najdorf ...Nbd7, as c6 is a more flexible square for the knight with a queen on b6) 9.Bd3 Qb6. = Adams Attack: 6.h3 = Introduced by Weaver Adams during the middle of the twentieth century, this odd-looking pawn move has mostly been used as a surprise weapon to combat the Najdorf. Should Black continue with 6...e5 anyway, White can respond with 7.Nde2 following up with g4 and Ng3, fighting for the weak light squares by playing g5. It is thus recommended that Black prevents g4 altogether with 7...h5. Black can also employ a Scheveningen setup with 6...e6 followed by 7.g4 b5 8.Bg2 Bb7, forcing White to lose more time by defending the e4-pawn, since ...b4 is a threat. It was not until early 2008 that an answer to Black was finally found. After 9.0-0 b4, White has the positional sacrifice 10.Nd5!, which gives Black long-term weaknesses and an open e-file for White to play on. Since then, it has been popular on all levels of play. = Other sixth moves for White = Beside the main lines mentioned above White has other options: 6.f3 and 6.g3 are less common, but are also respected responses to the Najdorf. Moves such as 6.a4, 6.Bd3, 6.Qf3, 6.Rg1 (the Petronic Attack), 6.Nb3, 6.a3, 6.h4, 6.f3 and 6.Qe2 are rarely played, but are not so bad and may be used for surprise value.

It is one of the oldest Half-Life mods and has been described as a classic one.PCZone review of Science and Industry 0.97a The current version of the game is 1.4 beta 10, released on May 20, 2018. The game was first publicly released on July 31, 1999, as version 0.94.  Gameplay  Players assume the role of a security guard for one of two fictional corporations Amalgamated Fluorodynamics (AFD) and Midland Carbide Labs (MCL). The main objective on the standard map type is to capture enemy scientists (who are non-player characters) while defending your own. This is accomplished by locating your enemies research labs, hitting one of the scientists there over the head with your briefcase and then taking him back to your company's administrator. Additional scientists increase the rate of a company's income which can be considered the team's score. Scientists also research new weapons, implants, armor upgrades and devices for their company. Each time a new technology is completed, players vote for the next one to be researched. Players spawn in the \\"Cloning Facilities\\" of their company, where they can find weapons and ammo crates, as well as health and armor chargers. At the start of the game, the only weapons available are a briefcase and a pistol, but this arsenal grows bigger as new weapons are researched by the scientists. Players decide which technology to research next by voting for it. The available technologies are divided in 5 branches: Weapons, Armor, Implants, Devices and Process Upgrades. Players decide to either defend their company or attack the other company. Attacking consists mainly of reaching the other company's laboratories, grabbing a scientist by knocking him out with the briefcase, and carrying back to the administrator. If a player dies while carrying a scientist, the scientist stays on the ground unconscious for a limited amount of time before teleporting back to his laboratories. During that time the original carrier or one of his teammates can pick up the scientist again. Some maps feature alternative objectives such as stealing resources (discs, biospecimen) or breaking computers. Defending requires protecting the company's laboratories, this is usually done by defending key areas (entries to the laboratories), killing intruders, and defending unconscious scientists. =Objectives= A standard game lasts 30 minutes. The company with the most money at the end wins. The main way to earn money is to have more scientists than the enemy. Each company starts with 3 scientists, so a company is making more money than the enemy corporation if it employs at least 4 scientists. So the team with more scientists wins. Some maps feature other objectives than capturing and protecting scientists. A first kind of alternative objective is breakables: these are computers or machinery that can be broken and cost money to replace. A second kind of alternative objective is resources: these are computer discs or research specimen that can be stolen and give a cash bonus. Players also cost money to their company each time they die, since cloning them back to life is not free.

He held several governmental positions between 1880 and 1905 and was also Governor of New Zealand between 1889 and 1892. Background and education Born at Old Alresford, Hampshire, Onslow was the only son of George Augustus Cranley Onslow, son of the Hon. Thomas Cranley Onslow, second son of Thomas Onslow, 2nd Earl of Onslow. His mother was Mary Harriet Anne Loftus. In 1870, at the age of 17, he succeeded his great-uncle in the earldom of Onslow. He was educated at Eton and Exeter College, Oxford. Political career, 1880‚Äì1889 Onslow briefly served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) under the Earl of Beaconsfield (Benjamin Disraeli) between February and April 1880 and held the same position under Lord Salisbury between 1886 and 1887, and later served under Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1887 and 1888 (in which post he was vice president of the first Colonial Conference in April 1887) and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade between 1888 and 1889. Governor of New Zealand, 1889‚Äì1892 In November 1888 Onslow was appointed Governor of New Zealand. As a result of the economic downturn in the late 1880s, he had sought a salaried position as a colonial governor. At 35, he was the youngest governor of New Zealand since George Grey was appointed in 1845 and the first since Robert FitzRoy in 1843 to have no previous experience in a vice-regal position. The New Zealand government had recently cut allowances for the governor, and Onslow was able to obtain the position mainly as it was no longer attractive to more senior colonial administrators. He assumed the office on 2 May 1889. Shortly after his arrival in Wellington, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever in the town. Onslow's twelve-year-old son and heir, Viscount Cranley, caught the disease and was at one time seen to be in danger of his life. After this Onslow and his family avoided the capital as much as they could - which did not endear them to the New Zealand people. According to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, Onslow did not \\"have the flair or flamboyance which helped some later governors win popular support\\". In 1890 Onslow became embroiled in controversy over appointments to the Legislative Council (the upper house of the New Zealand parliament), which were made by the governor on the advice of his ministers. Up until then Prime Minister Harry Atkinson had not made any recommendations on appointments. However, this year Atkinson's conservative supporters became more and more concerned that the Liberals under John Ballance would gain power. Atkinson was put under pressure to assure that there was a conservative majority in the Council. Onslow, as a Conservative, is considered to have been sympathetic to the idea, especially as he was used to the system in Britain, where it was acceptable practice for an outgoing British government to nominate new members of the House of Lords. He informed Atkinson that a \\"little list\\" of nominations for the Legislative Council could be agreed upon and used \\"if things go wrong with you in the House or Country\\". Atkinson lost ground in the election of December 1890, although it was unclear if the Liberals under Ballance would get enough support to form an administration. Rumours of the \\"little list\\" began to spread and Onslow was made aware that, even if it was common practice for an outgoing government in Britain to nominate members for the House of Lords, this was not the case in New Zealand. However, despite public opposition Onslow followed Atkinson's recommendations and nominated six people to the council (although the number was reduced from eleven). He justified his decision to the Colonial Office in London on the basis that he could find no Royal instruction or colonial precedent for refusing Atkinson's nomination and referred to \\"the constant practice in England\\". Onslow's actions even further damaged the reputation of the council. Several independent members were pressurised into supporting Ballance, who was able to form an administration. In 1891 Ballance asked Onslow to nominate 18 representatives to the council in order to counterbalance Atkinson's nominations of the previous year. Onslow said he was unwilling to alter the composition of the council and replace the conservative majority with a liberal one, stating that in his view an upper house of parliament should always be conservative in its nature. He agreed to nominate eight representatives, a compromise Ballance declined. The matter was finally deferred to Onslow's successor, the Earl of Glasgow. Onslow resigned in February 1892 and returned to England. Political career, 1892‚Äì1911 When the Conservatives returned to power in 1895 under Lord Salisbury, Onslow was made Under-Secretary of State for India, a post he retained until 1900, and was then once again Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1900 and 1903 (from 1902 to 1903 under the premiership of Arthur Balfour). In 1903 he entered Balfour's cabinet as President of the Board of Agriculture and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He remained at the Board of Agriculture until the government fell in 1905. From 1905 to 1911 he was Lord Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords. He was also President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1905 to 1906.His death was considered a loss to the [RSPB]. Family Lord Onslow married the Hon Florence Coulston Gardner, daughter of Alan Gardner, 3rd Baron Gardner, in 1875. They had two sons and two daughters: *Lady Dorothy Evelyn Augusta Onslow, married E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, on 21 September 1909. * Richard William Alan Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow (born 23 August 1876, died 9 June 1945) * Lady Gwendolen Florence Mary Onslow (born 22 July 1881, died 16 February 1966), married Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh * The Honourable Victor Alexander Herbert Huia Onslow (born 13 November 1890, died 27 June 1922), married Muriel Wheldale on 3 February 1919. He was the first child of a governor to be born in the country; hence the MƒÅori name Huia. He died some time after suffering a spinal accident when he dived into an Austrian lake in the Dolomites on 16 July 1911. Lord Onslow died at Hendon, Middlesex, in October 1911, aged 58. He was succeeded in the earldom by his elder son, Richard. The Dowager Countess of Onslow died in August 1934.

During the War of 1812, he commanded in a single-ship action against commanded by Philip Broke. He is probably best known today for his last words or \\"dying command\\" \\"Don't give up the ship!\\", which is still a popular naval battle cry, and which was invoked by Oliver Hazard Perry's personal battle flag, adopted to commemorate his dead friend. Biography Lawrence was born on October 1, 1781, in Burlington, New Jersey but raised in Woodbury, New Jersey, the son of John and Martha (Tallman) Lawrence. His mother died when he was an infant and his Loyalist father fled to Canada during the American Revolution, leaving his half-sister to care for the infant. He attended Woodbury Academy. Though Lawrence studied law, he entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in 1798. During the Quasi-War with France, he served on and the frigate in the Caribbean. He was commissioned a lieutenant on April 6, 1802, and served aboard in the Mediterranean, taking part in a successful attack on enemy craft on 2 June 1803. In February 1804, he was second in command during the expedition to destroy the captured frigate . Later in the conflict he commanded Enterprise and a gunboat in battles with the Tripolitans. He was also First Lieutenant of the frigate Adams and, in 1805, commanded the small Gunboat No. 6 during a voyage across the Atlantic to North Africa. Although Gunboats No. 2 through 10 (minus No. 7) arrived in the Mediterranean too late to see action, they remained there with Commodore Rodgers's squadron until summer 1806, at which time they sailed back to the United States. On 12 June 1805, Gunboat No. 6 encountered a Royal Navy vessel that impressed three seamen.Smith (1995), pp. 95‚Äì86.Tucker (1993), pp. 77‚Äì9. Subsequently, Lieutenant Lawrence commanded the warships , and . In 1810, he also took part in trials of an experimental spar torpedo. Promoted to the rank of Master Commandant in November 1810, he took command of the sloop of war a year later and sailed her to Europe on a diplomatic mission. From the beginning of the War of 1812, Lawrence and Hornet cruised actively, capturing the privateer Dolphin in July 1812. Later in the year Hornet blockaded the British sloop at Bahia, Brazil, and on 24 February 1813 captured . by F. Muller. US Navy Art Collection Battle flag used by Oliver Hazard Perry Artist representation of the \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\" moment Upon his return to the United States in March, Lawrence learned of his promotion to Captain. Two months later he took command of the frigate Chesapeake, then preparing for sea at Boston. He left port on 1 June 1813 and immediately engaged the blockading Royal Navy frigate Shannon in a fierce battle. Although slightly smaller, the British ship disabled Chesapeake with gunfire within the first few minutes. Captain Lawrence, mortally wounded by small arms fire, ordered his officers, \\"Don't give up the ship. Fight her till she sinks\\" or \\"Tell the men to fire faster! Don't give up the ship.\\" Men carried him below, and his crew was overwhelmed by a British boarding party shortly afterward. James Lawrence died of his wounds on 4 June 1813, while his captors directed Chesapeake to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After Lawrence's death was reported to his friend and fellow officer Oliver Hazard Perry, he ordered a large blue battle ensign, stitched with the phrase \\"DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP\\" in bold white letters. The Perry Flag was displayed on his flagship during a victorious engagement against the British on Lake Erie in September 1813. The original flag is displayed in the Naval Academy Museum and a replica is displayed in Memorial Hall at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. A replica is also on view at Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial, on South Bass Island, Ohio. James Lawrence's grave at Trinity Church Cemetery. Lawrence was buried with military honors at present-day CFB Halifax, Nova Scotia, but reinterred at Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City.

She had two siblings; her older sister, Ellen Mary, was born in 1840, and her younger brother, Aubrey St. John, was born in 1843. All of the Clerke children were entirely home schooled.  Life and work  Following in her father's footsteps‚Äîwhile studying classics, he had also taken courses in astronomy‚Äîshe developed an interest in astronomy from an early age, using her father's 4 inch telescope in her observations and had begun to write a history of astronomy at the age of 15. In 1861, aged 19, her family moved to Dublin, and in 1863 to Queenstown. At the age of 25, partly for health reasons together with her elder sister Ellen, she went to Italy where she stayed until 1877, chiefly at Florence, studying science, languages, and other subjects that would be useful in their later lives. In 1877 she settled in London. Upon her return, she was able to get two articles, \\"Brigandage in Sicily\\" and \\"Copernicus in Italy\\", written while she had been in Italy, published in the Edinburgh Review of October 1877. This led to her being asked by Adam and Charles Black, publishers of the Review, who also published the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, to write biographies of a number of famous scientists for the ninth edition of the encyclopedia.Important Contributors to the Britannica, 9th and 10th Editions Important Contributors to the Britannica, 9th and 10th Editions, 1902encyclopedia.com. Retrieved 16 April 2017. This work let to a number of other commissions, including the publication of the article on astronomy for the Catholic Encyclopedia. During her career she wrote reviews of many books, including some written in French, German, Greek, or Italian. In 1885, she published her best known work A Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century, which has received recognition beyond the time it was written. Clerke was not a practical astronomer, instead collating, interpreting and summarising the results of astronomical research. In 1888 she spent three months at the Cape Observatory as the guest of the director, Sir David Gill, and his wife, and there became sufficiently familiar with spectroscopic work to be able to write about this newer branch of the science with increased clearness and confidence. In 1893 she was awarded the Actonian Prize of 100 guineas by the Royal Institution. As a member of the British Astronomical Association she attended its meetings regularly, as well as those of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1903, with Lady Huggins, she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society, a rank previously held only by three other women, Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville in 1835, and Anne Sheepshanks in 1862. Her sister, Ellen Mary Clerke (1840‚Äì1906), also wrote about astronomy. She was a devout Catholic all her life. The Messenger Monthly Magazine 1907 The lunar crater Clerke is named after her. In 2002, the retired astronomy lecturer Mary Br√ºck wrote a book on her, Agnes Mary Clerke and the Rise of Astrophysics. In 2017, the Royal Astronomical Society established the Agnes Clerke Medal for the History of Astronomy or Geophysics, which is awarded to individuals who have achieved outstanding research into the history of astronomy or geophysics.

He was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1952 to 1955. Born in 1899 in London, United Kingdom, Gentry's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1910. He joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1916 as a cadet. Following graduation from the Royal Military College in 1919, he was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps and held a number of staff positions in New Zealand and abroad. He saw active service during the Second World War as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division, initially as a staff officer but later on as a brigade commander. After the cessation of hostilities in 1945 he held senior staff positions in the New Zealand Military Forces. From 1952 Gentry served as Chief of the General Staff until his retirement in 1955. He died in 1991 in Lower Hutt. Early life Gentry was born in London on 20 February 1899 to Frederick Gentry, a leather salesman, and his wife, Eliza . When he was 11 years old, his family emigrated to New Zealand, settling in Wellington. Educated at Wellington College, he was one of the limited number of New Zealand entrants in 1916 who enrolled in the Royal Military College at Duntroon in Australia. Military career Gentry graduated from Duntroon in 1919 and was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps. He was seconded to the British Indian Army for two years, serving on the North-West Frontier during the Waziristan campaign and the Moplah rebellion. On returning to New Zealand, he held a number of staff positions in the Central Military District and was promoted to captain in 1926. In 1934 he was sent to England on attachment to the Corps of Royal Engineers for 18 months and also attended engineering courses. He then served at General Headquarters in Wellington as staff officer, Engineers, before returning to England to attend the Staff College at Camberley, graduating in 1939. =Second World War= Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Gentry was promoted to major. He briefly served with the British Expeditionary Force in France before traveling to Egypt to join the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he served as assistant adjutant and quartermaster general of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the Battle of Greece. In the Battle of Crete he was acting general staff office (GSO1) in the stead of Brigadier Keith Stewart, who was fulfilling an equivalent role with Creforce. Gentry performed his duties competently and was in the 1950 New Year Honours appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services during this time. He was also awarded the Greek Military Cross. In October 1941, after the departure of Stewart to take up the position of Deputy Chief of Staff in New Zealand, Gentry became GSO1 of the 2nd New Zealand Division. In this role, he served under General Freyberg and developed a relationship where he could question Freyberg \\"without arousing impatience or irritation\\". He earned a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his conduct during the First Battle of El Alamein. The citation for his award read: In September 1942, he was promoted to brigadier and appointed commander of the 6th Infantry Brigade, the previous commander having been made a prisoner of war. Despite having no experience in commanding infantry, he led the brigade well until August 1943, at which time he replaced Stewart as Deputy Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Edward Puttick. He served in this role for nearly 18 months before rejoining the 2NZEF. After a period in Egypt in command of New Zealand troops there, from February 1945 Gentry commanded the newly formed 9th Infantry Brigade. His new command included the Divisional Cavalry and Machine Gun Battalion, both of which had been converted to an infantry role and were joined by the 22nd Battalion.Kay, 1967, pp. 387‚Äì389 After a period of training, the brigade participated in the final stages of the Italian Campaign and Gentry was awarded a Bar to his DSO for his leadership of the brigade during this time. Command of his brigade was passed to Stewart on 10 November 1945Kay, 1967, p. 577 and he returned to New Zealand. He was discharged from the 2NZEF in March 1946. Later life After serving for a time with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the organisation responsible for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, Gentry had a second term as Deputy Chief of Staff, this time to Major General Norman Weir. In 1949 he attended the Imperial Defence College in England. After completion of his courses, Gentry returned to staff duties in New Zealand, serving as Adjutant General to Stewart, now Chief of Staff, and worked with him in preparing plans for the Government's commitment to deploy military forces to the Middle East in the event of hostilities with the Soviet Union. This work led to several clashes with the Government. Promoted to major general, from 1952 to 1955 Gentry served as Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces. He represented New Zealand in ANZUS and was involved in planning for the defence of Southeast Asia. In the 1954 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath and the following year retired from the military. In a break with convention he was not rewarded with a knighthood for his services. This may have been due to some ill-feeling within the Government regarding his work developing proposed plans for New Zealand's Middle East deployment. He was appointed knighted three years later by the newly elected Labour Government in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours. In his retirement Gentry had a strong relationship with the Boy Scouts Association and served as its New Zealand president from 1957 to 1967. He was awarded the association's Silver Wolf. He died on 13 October 1991 in Lower Hutt, where he had lived for many years, at the age of 92. His wife, whom he married in 1926, died in 1994.

Publication history First published in August 1967, the magazine was preceded by sister publications 16 Magazine, which debuted in 1956, and Tiger Beat, which was first published in 1965. Teen Beat was published by Sterling's Magazines from 1967‚Äìc. 1985, including a period when it was part of Sterling's Ideal Publishing Company. (Sterling's also published Metal Edge, Metal Maniacs, Country Music Special, and others.) In the mid-1980s, Sterling's 'Ideal teen magazines' Teen Beat, Tiger Beat, Super Teen and Super Teen's Loudmouth were acquired by Macfadden Publications. In 1985 Michael Liben was the publisher of Teen Beat. The mid-1990s saw a slump in the overall teen magazine market. In 1998, the conglomerate's line of youth music publications was sold off to Primedia. In 2001, after publishing up to twelve magazines each year, Primedia decided to reduce its number of publications to only four magazines per year, deciding to keep 16, Tiger Beat, Teen Beat, and BOP Magazine. In October 2001 the frequency of Teen Beat switched to quarterly. Teen Beat ceased publishing c. 2007.

Specifically, it refers to the technique of having the transmitting device send a clock signal along with the data signals. The timing of the unidirectional data signals is referenced to the clock (often called the strobe) sourced by the same device that generates those signals, and not to a global clock (i.e. generated by a bus master). Compared to other digital clocking topologies like system-synchronous clocks, where a global clock source is fed to all devices in the system, a source-synchronous clock topology can attain far higher speeds. This type of clocking is common in high-speed interfaces between micro-chips, including DDR SDRAM, SGI XIO interface, Intel Front Side Bus for the x86 and Itanium processors, HyperTransport, SPI-4.2 and many others.  Reasons for usage  A reason that source-synchronous clocking is useful is that it has been observed that all of the circuits within a given semiconductor device experience roughly the same process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variation. This means signal propagation delay experienced by the data through a device tracks the delay experienced by the clock through that same device over PVT. This advantage allows higher speed operation as compared to the traditional technique of providing the clock from a third device to both the transmitter and the receiver. Another benefit is that higher complexity data-recovery or clock-data-recovery circuits (such as PLLs) are not required when this technique is used. Or rather than higher clock speeds, large systems that take advantage of source- synchronous clocking can have the benefit of a higher tolerance of PVT variation of its individual components. = Timing Analysis = Synchronous logic elements such as flip-flops have static timing criteria that must be satisfied in order for them to work correctly. In a system-synchronous clock topology where a skew-aligned clock is fed to all devices, the criteria are T_{clock} > T_{setup} + T_{ko} + T_{skew} A source-synchronous clock topology eliminates two of these factors, T_{ko} and T_{skew}. The former is eliminated since both clock and data signals are driven by identical flip-flops on the same silicon at the same temperature and voltage, thereby equalizing the T_{ko} seen by both clock and data. The latter is eliminated for the same reason - since the clock and data are driven by identical devices and (ideally) connected with wires of equal length, the skew between clock and data is greatly reduced. For this reason, T_{clock} can be reduced significantly. Since frequency is inversely proportional to clock period, the clock frequency increases as a result.  Drawbacks  One drawback of using source-synchronous clocking is the creation of a separate clock-domain at the receiving device, namely the clock-domain of the strobe generated by the transmitting device. This strobe clock-domain is often not synchronous to the core clock domain of the receiving device. For proper operation of the received data with other data already present in the device, an additional stage of synchronization logic is required to transfer the received data into the core clock-domain of the receiving device. This stage can often be found alongside source synchronous logic. This usually results in greater system complexity compared to globally clocked systems, but the benefits are generally much greater than this increase in complexity.  Implementation Variations  In bi-directional data transfer buses, two opposing unidirectional strobes can be sent from each device. Often the strobe is free running in this case. That is, the strobe continues to toggle whether there is data being transferred or not. Another variation is the sharing of the same bus to transfer the strobe. In this case the strobe can only be transferred by the device that is sending the data and may require transmission of pre-ambles and post-ambles to indicate the start and end of the strobes. (Example: DDR2). In large ASICs or processors, multiple strobes and data groups (data bits that are associated to the same strobe) may exist between the same two devices to account for the slightly different PVT variations in different regions of the same die.

He was Home Secretary under David Lloyd George from 1916 to 1919 and served as Lord Chancellor from 1922 to 1924 and again from 1924 to 1928. Background and education Cave was born in London, the son of Thomas Cave, Member of Parliament for Barnstaple, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Jasper Shallcrass. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, London and St John's College, Oxford. After being called to the bar in 1880, he practised as a barrister for a number of years, being made King's Counsel and recorder of Guildford in 1904. Political career Portrait of the Viscount Cave. In 1906 he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the Kingston Division of Surrey, was appointed Vice-Lieutenant of Surrey in 1907, and a member of the Royal Commission on Land Purchase in 1908. Having served as standing Counsel to the University of Oxford for two years as well as Attorney General to the Prince of Wales, in 1915 Cave was appointed Solicitor General and knighted. The following year, he was made Home Secretary in Lloyd George's coalition government, a post he held for three years. As Home Secretary, he introduced the Representation of the People Act 1918 and he was very prominent in the debates in the House of Commons on the police strike of August 1918. In 1918, Sir George Cave was ennobled as Viscount Cave, of Richmond in the County of Surrey. The following year, he became a Lord of Appeal, and chaired a number of commissions, including the Southern Rhodesian commission and the Munitions Enquiry Tribunal. In 1922, he became Lord Chancellor in Bonar Law's government, and again served in this capacity in Baldwin's first administration. He chaired the post war report that led to cuts to the minimum wages and regulation of collective bargaining, recommended by the Cave Committee in 1922.Cave Committee, Report to the Ministry of Labour of the Committee Appointed to Enquire into the Working and Effects of the Trade Board Acts (1922) Cmd 1645 Having been appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1921, he was also elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1925, defeating former Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. Asquith was deeply upset by the defeat, partly because he felt that Cave, an old friend, should not have stood against him.Jenkins, Roy Asquith Collins, 1964, p.511 He has been described, perhaps too harshly, as the least distinguished Lord Chancellor in the first three decades of the twentieth century.Jenkins p.511 Family Lord Cave married Anne Estella Sarah Penfold Mathews, daughter of William Withey Mathews and sister of Sir Lloyd Mathews, in 1885. Lord and Lady Cave had three sons and one daughter, although all of them died in infancy. Their names were Ralph Wallas, Lloyd George, Honor E, and Matthew G. They are all buried at St. Mary's in Richmond. Cave died in March 1928, aged 72, at St Ann's, Burnham, Somerset, and was buried at Berrow in the same county. On the day of his death his resignation as Lord Chancellor had been accepted and it had been announced that he would be created an earl, and so his widow was created Countess Cave of Richmond, with remainder to heirs male of her body. Having no children who lived to adulthood, the viscountcy became extinct on Lord Cave's death, as did the earldom when his widow died in 1938.

Historically, the Gaelic word m√≤d (), which came from Old Norse m√≥t, refers to any kind of assembly. There are both local m√≤ds, and an annual national m√≤d, the Royal National M√≤d. M√≤ds are run under the auspices of An Comunn G√†idhealach. The term comes from a Gaelic word for a parliament or congress in common use during the Lordship of the Isles. A M√≤d largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events (in Gaelic, both solo and choirs), and traditional music including fiddle, bagpipe and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children and adult's poetry reading, storytelling and Bible reading, and categories such as Ancient Folk Tale or Humorous Monologue. Children can also present an original drama, and there are competitions in written literature. Unlike the National M√≤d, local m√≤ds usually only last a day or two. They attract a much smaller crowd and the only notable social event is the winners' ceilidh. As there are fewer competitions than in the National M√≤d, this ceilidh is often more like a traditional ceilidh with dancing and guest singers between the winners' performances. Culturally, m√≤ds are comparable to an Irish Feis (although Scotland also has its own f√®isean and f√®is movement) or the Welsh eisteddfod, but without the ancient roots or the fanciful nineteenth-century \\"druidic\\" pageantry of the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

It is the main festival of Scottish Gaelic literature, song, arts and culture and one of the more notable peripatetic cultural festivals in Scotland. It is often referred to simply as the M√≤d. The M√≤d is run by An Comunn G√†idhealach (The Gaelic Association) and includes competitions and awards. History The M√≤d was founded by An Comunn G√†idhealach. St Columba's Church, Glasgow also greatly influenced the M√≤d's inception when, in 1891, its choir was invited to give a Gaelic Concert in Oban, presided over by Lord Archibald Campbell.\\"Encouragement to the Gaelic Mod\\" in The Highlander's Friend Chapter 9, Highland Cathedral, St Columba's Church of Scotland The concert was attended by much of the nobility, including Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife. After the concert the choir were entertained to supper at the Alexandra Hotel, and a description of the entertainment is given in one of William Black's novels. This concert was the prelude to the Gaelic M√≤d, the first being held at Oban the following year, when St. Columba Choir were successful in the Choir competition. The M√≤d has been held most years in October since 1892. The only years in which the National M√≤d was not held were the war years of 1914-1919 and 1939-1946, and the pandemic year of 2020. The \\"Royal\\" was not originally part of the name. It is still the practice of the St Columba's Church to send a concert party to start off the fund-raising when the M√≤d visits Oban. As well as winning the premier choir competition for the first three years, the church has also had many M√≤d gold medallists over the years. The M√≤d itself has been greatly influenced by the National Eisteddfod of Wales, although it tends to be somewhat more restrained in its ceremonial aspects. Competitions The M√≤d largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events and traditional music including Gaelic song, fiddle, bagpipe, clarsach and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children's and adults' poetry reading, storytelling and Bible reading, and categories such as Ancient Folk Tale or Humorous Monologue. Children can also present an original drama, and there are competitions in written literature. The M√≤d also runs an annual shinty competition, the M√≤d Cup, between the two shinty teams closest to where the M√≤d is taking place. The winners of each day's competitions are invited to perform in the winners' c√®ilidhs held every evening. The M√≤d is a celebration of [Scottish] Gaelic language and culture, which raises its profile and contributes towards the aim of securing its future. Improvements in the provision of Gaelic-medium education across Scotland have meant that by 2007 the junior fluent speakers' section had increased to such an extent that the organisers were forced to extend some of the competitions beyond one day. There has been some criticism of the prominence of the \\"Gold Medal\\" event of operatic-style singing, which some Gaelic musicians feel marginalises traditional singing styles. Culturally, the M√≤d is comparable to the Welsh Eisteddfod and the Irish Oireachtas na Gaeilge. The M√≤d Fringe Na Gathan performing at the M√≤d Fringe in Falkirk The M√≤d draws a large crowd, which leads local venues to put on various events in addition to the official M√≤d events. These events are collectively referred to as the M√≤d Fringe. To participants, the M√≤d is also an opportunity to meet with old friends and make new ones. The M√≤d is popularly known as the \\"Whisky Olympics\\", considered \\"either a vicious slur or fair comment\\". Media coverage BBC Scotland has traditionally broadcast M√≤d highlights on BBC One, BBC Two and Radio nan G√†idheal. Since its introduction in 2008, BBC Alba has provided coverage in Gaelic. Presenters have included traditional musician, Gaelic speaker and broadcaster, Mary Ann Kennedy and Gaelic broadcaster Cathy Crombie.

It was first described by Gray in 1872 from a specimen recovered in northern Australia--hence the inappropriate specific name tropicalis.  Description  The subantarctic fur seal is medium in size compared with other fur seals. Males grow to 2 m and 160 kg, whereas females are substantially smaller--1.4 m and 50 kg. Both sexes have distinctive, creamy-orange chests and faces. Their bellies are more brownish. Males have a dark grey to black back. The females are lighter grey. Pups are black at birth, but molt at about 3 months old. The snout is short and flat. The flippers are short and broad. Subantarctic fur seals live for about 20‚Äì25 years.  Distribution  Subantarctic fur seals are geographically widespread. As their name implies, they generally breed in more northerly locations than the Antarctic fur seals. The largest breeding colonies are on Gough Island in the South Atlantic and √éle Amsterdam in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. Breeding grounds are also found at Marion Island in the Prince Edward Islands (where an overlap with Antarctic fur seals occurs), the Crozet Islands, and Macquarie Island. Where grounds overlap, the subantarctic species can be identified by the orange colour on the chest. About 300,000 of the species alive today, probably substantially down from when they were first discovered in 1810, as they were hunted for their pelts throughout the 19th century. Populations are recovering rapidly, though, in most areas whilst under the protection of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. A small population on Heard Island is endangered. Unlike the Antarctic fur seal, whose genetic variation is low due to hunting making all but one breeding colony extinct by 1900, the diversity amongst subantarctic specimens remains high. Diet Subantarctic fur seals hunt in shallow waters at night, when myctophid fish come close to the surface. They also feed on squid.

Development began in the 1950s by the Reaction Motors Division of Thiokol Chemical Company to power the North American X-15 hypersonic research aircraft. It could deliver up to 57,000 pounds force (254 kN) of thrust with an Isp of 279 seconds (239 seconds sl). Thrust was variable from 50 to 100 percent, and the restart capability allowed it to be shut down and restarted during flight when necessary. Design and development The engine is propelled by liquid oxygen and anhydrous ammonia, pumped into the engine by turbopumps at a mass flow rate of over per minute. After one hour of operation, the XLR99 required an overhaul. Operating times nearly twice that were recorded in tests, but declared largely unsafe. The basic X-15 aircraft carried fuel for about 83 seconds of full-powered flight, while the X-15A-2 carried fuel for just over 150 seconds. Therefore, each XLR99 was capable, in theory, of between 20 and 40 flights before an overhaul. Like many other liquid-fuel rocket engines, the XLR99s used regenerative cooling, in that the thrust chamber and nozzle had tubing surrounding it, through which the propellant and oxidizer passed before being burned. This kept the engine cool, and preheated the fuel. The basic engine has a mass of .

The Republic prospered as the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League and its Slavic, Baltic and Finnic people were much influenced by the culture of the Viking-Varangians and Byzantine people. History In the middle of the 9th century Novgorod was a name used to describe Viking staging posts on the trade route from the Baltic Sea to the Byzantine Empire. There is a theory that in fact it was not Novgorod as misinterpreted by later chroniclers (as stated by dendrochronology, Novgorod was founded only in the middle of the 10th century),http://archaeology.nsc.ru/ru/publish/journal/doc/2009/371/9.pdf but Nevo Gardas ‚Äì Viking settlements on Lake Ladoga, as in one of Nestor's chronicles from the 12th century he mentions a lake called \\"the Great Nevo\\", a clear link to the Neva River and, possibly furthermore, to Finnish nevo \\"sea\\" or neva \\"bog, quagmire\\".Evgeny Pospelov: Geographical Names of the World: Toponymic Dictionary.

However, these tribes came together during the beginning of the 9th century to try and form a negotiated settlement to end military aggression between each other.Sixsmith, Martin. \\"Chapter 1.\\" Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East. New York, NY: Overlook Pr., 2012 The Novgorod First Chronicle, a collection of writings depicting the history of Novgorod from 1016‚Äì1471, states that these tribes wanted to \\"Seek a prince who may rule over us and judge us according to law.\\"Primary Chronicle By transforming its governing institutions, Novgorod rejected its politically dependent relationship to Kiev.Martin, Janet. \\"Kievan Rus: the final century.\\" Medieval Rus: 980-1584. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 103. Print. Novgordian Rus' and its inhabitants were much influenced by the Viking culture and people. These cultural and ethnic Scandinavian imprint shaped later the society of Muscovite Rus' and whole Russia. In 882, Prince Oleg founded the Kievan Rus', of which Novgorod was a part from then until 1019‚Äì1020. Novgorod Princes were appointed by the Grand Prince of Kiev (usually one of the elder sons). The Novgorod boyars began to dominate the offices of posadnik and tysyatsky, which until about the mid-12th century had been appointed by the grand prince in Kiev. In 1136, the Novgorodians dismissed Prince Vsevolod Mstislavich and over the next century and a half were able to invite in and dismiss a number of princes. However, these invitations or dismissals were often based on who was the dominant prince in Rus' at the time, and not on any independent thinking on the part of Novgorod.Michael C. Paul, \\"Was the Prince of Novgorod a 'Third-rate bureaucrat' after 1136?\\" Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas 56, No. 1 (Spring 2008): 72‚Äì113. Cities such as Staraya Russa, Staraya Ladoga, Torzhok, and Oreshek were part of the Novgorodian Land. According to some accounts, a vicar of the archbishop ran the city of Staraya Ladoga in the 13th century. The city of Pskov, initially part of the Novgorodian Land, had de facto independence from at least the 13th century after joining the Hanseatic League. Several princes such as Dovmont (ca 1240‚Äì1299) and Vsevolod Mstislavich (before 1117‚Äì1138) reigned in Pskov without any deference to or consultation with the prince or other officials in Novgorod. Pskov's independence was acknowledged by the Treaty of Bolotovo in 1348 (see Pskov Republic). Even after this, however, the Archbishop of Novgorod headed the church in Pskov and kept the title \\"Archbishop of Novgorod the Great and Pskov\\" until 1589. The Republic was the subject of political rivalry between Poland and Lithuania on one side and the Grand Duchy of Moscow on the other side in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1389 the newly appointed Prince of Novgorod, Lithuanian prince Lengvenis, paid homage from the Novgorod territories to Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in Sandomierz, thus the Novgorod Republic became a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Poland. Novgorod troops under the command of Lengvenis took part in the Battle of Grunwald (1410) on the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian side. In the 12th‚Äì15th centuries, the Novgorodian Republic expanded east and northeast. The Novgorodians explored the areas around Lake Onega, along the Northern Dvina, and coastlines of the White Sea. At the beginning of the 14th century, the Novgorodians explored the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, and the West-Siberian river Ob. The Ugrian tribes that inhabited the Northern Urals had to pay tribute to Novgorod the Great. The lands to the north of the city, rich with furs, sea fauna, salt, etc., were of great economic importance to the Novgorodians, who fought a protracted series of wars with Moscow beginning in the late 14th century in order to keep these lands. Losing them meant economic and cultural decline for the city and its inhabitants. Indeed, the ultimate failure of the Novgorodians to win these wars led to the downfall of the Republic. Soviet-era Marxist scholarship frequently described the political system of Novgorod as a \\"feudal republic\\", placing it within the Marxist historiographic periodization (slavery ‚Äì feudalism ‚Äì capitalism ‚Äì socialism ‚Äì communism).Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto. Many scholars today, however, question whether Russia ever really had a feudal political system parallel to that of the medieval West.See, for example, Igor Froianov, Kievskaia Rus; ocherki sotsial ºno-ekonomicheskoƒ≠ istorii. (Leningrad: Leningrad State University, 1974). Government Medieval walls of the Novgorod Kremlin from the late 15th century. The Kokui tower (left) dates from the 17th century; its name is of Swedish origin. The city state of Novgorod had developed procedures of governance that held a large measure of democratic participation far in advance of the rest of Europe.Sixsmith, Martin. \\"Chapter 3.\\" Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East. New York, NY: Overlook Pr., 2012. 19. Print. The people had the power to elect city officials and they even had the power to elect and fire the prince. The Chronicle writer then goes on to describe a \\"town meeting\\" where these decisions would have been made, which included people from all social classes ranging from the Posadniki (Burgomaster), to the Chernye Liudi (literally, the black folks) or the lowest free class.Sixsmith, Martin. \\"Chapter 3.\\" Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East. New York, NY: Overlook Pr., 2012. 20. Print. The precise constitution of the medieval Novgorodian Republic is uncertain, although traditional histories have created the image of a highly institutionalized network of veches (public assemblies) and a government of posadniks (burgomaster), tysyatskys (\\"thousandmen,\\" originally the head of the town militia, but later a judicial and commercial official), other members of aristocratic families, and the archbishops of Novgorod. Some scholars argue that the archbishop was the head of the executive branch of the government, although it is difficult to determine the exact competence of the various officials. It is possible that there was a \\"Council of Lords\\" (–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥) that was headed by the archbishop and met in the archiepiscopal palace (and in the Chamber of Facets after 1433).V. O. Kliuchevskii, Boiarskaia Duma drevnei Rus; Dobrye liudi Drevnei Rus (Moscow: Ladomir1994), 172‚Äì206; Idem., Sochinenii, vol. 2, pp. 68‚Äì69George Vernadsky, Kievan Rus (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1948), 98, 197‚Äì201. The (at least nominal) executives of Novgorod were always the Princes of Novgorod, invited by Novgorodians from the neighboring states, even though their power waned in the 13th and early 14th centuries.Valentin Yanin \\"Outline of history of medieval Novgorod.Paul, \\"Was the Prince of Novgorod a 'Third-rate bureaucrat' after 1136?\\" passim. It is unclear if the archbishop of Novgorod was the real head of state or chief executive of the Novgorod Republic, but in any case he remained an important town official. In addition to overseeing the church in Novgorod, he headed embassies, oversaw certain court cases of a secular nature, and carried out other secular tasks. However, the archbishops appear to have worked with the boyars to reach a consensus and almost never acted alone. The archbishop was not appointed, but elected by Novgorodians, and approved by the Metropolitan bishop of Russia. The archbishops were probably the richest single land-owners in Novgorod, and they also made money off court fees, fees for the use of weights and measures in the marketplace, and through other means.Michael C. Paul, \\"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest.\\" Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 8, no. 2 (Spring 2007): 231‚Äì270Idem, \\"Episcopal Election in Novgorod, Rus 1156-1478.\\" Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture 72, No. 2 (June 2003): 251‚Äì275. The Veche in Novgorod, by Vasily Khudyakov Another important executive was the Novgorod Posadnik, who chaired the Veche, co-chaired courts together with the Prince, oversaw tax collection and managed current affairs of the city. Most of the Prince's major decisions had to be approved by the Posadnik. In the mid-14th century, instead of one Posadnik, the Veche began electing six. These six posadniks kept their status for their lifetimes, and each year elected among themselves a chief Stepennoy Posadnik. Posadniks were almost invariably members of boyars - the city's highest aristocracy.Valentin Yanin Novgorod posadniks The precise makeup of the veche is also uncertain, although it appears to have comprised members of the urban population, as well as of the free rural population. Whether it was a democratic institution or one controlled by the boyars has been hotly debated. The posadniks, tysiatskys, and even the bishops and archbishops of NovgorodStarting from 1156, elevated to archiepiscopal status in 1165 were often elected or at least approved by the veche.Michael C. Paul, \\"The Iaroslavichi and the Novgorodian Veche 1230-1270: A Case Study on Princely Relations with the Veche,\\" Russian History/ Histoire Russe 31, No. 1‚Äì2 (Spring‚ÄìSummer, 2004): 41. Tradespeople and craftsmen also participated in the political affairs of Novgorod the Great. The traditional scholarship argues that they were organized into five \\"kontsy\\" (ends) ‚Äì konets (–∫–æ–Ω–µ—Ü; pl. –∫–æ–Ω—Ü—ã) in Russian ‚Äì i.e., the boroughs of the city they lived in; each end was then organized by the streets in which they lived. The ends and streets often bore names indicating that certain trades were concentrated in certain parts of the city (there was a Carpenter's End and a Potters' End, for example). The trade groups had sotnyas (—Å–æ—Ç–Ω–∏, or hundredmen) (see also Ivan's Hundred, thought to have been the first Russian guild, although there is no evidence of guilds existing in Rus' such as they were in, say, the Low Countries, Germany, France, or England). Novgorod within Kievan Rus' prior to independence. Like much of the rest of Novgorod's medieval history, the precise composition of these trade or crafts organizations is uncertain and they ought not to be confused with the much more organized guilds (or later unions) of Western Europe. It is quite possible that the \\"ends\\" and \\"streets\\" were simply neighborhood administrative groups rather than guilds or \\"unions\\". Street organizations were known to build churches in their neighborhoods and to have buried the dead of their neighborhoods during outbreaks of the plague, but beyond that their activities are uncertain. As for Ivan's Hundred, its exact nature is not known. It was organized around the Church of St. John the Forerunner on the Opoki, just north of the marketplace, and each member had to pay an entrance fee of a bolt of Ypres cloth (from Flanders) to the archbishop. The tysyatsky arbitrated disputes between the members. Other than that, the activities of Ivan's Hundred is unknown. \\"Streets\\" and \\"ends\\" may have taken part in political decision-making in Novgorod in support of certain boyar factions or to protect their interests. Merchant \\"elders\\" are also noted in treaties and other charters, but only about a hundred of these charters exist. A half dozen date from the 12th century, while most are from after 1262. Thus it is difficult to determine Novgorod's political structure due to the paucity of sources.Valk, ed. Gramoty Velikogo Novgoroda i Pskova The prince, while his status in Novgorod was not inheritable and his power was much reduced, remained an important figure in Novgorodian life. Of around 100 princes of Novgorod, many, if not most, were invited in or dismissed by the Novgorodians. At least some of them signed a contract called a r'ad (—Ä—è–¥), which protected the interests of the Novgorodian boyars and laid out the prince's rights and responsibilities. The r'ads that have been preserved in archives describe the relationship of Novgorod with twelve invited Princes: five of them from Tver', four from Moscow, and three from Lithuania.Valentin Yanin Novgorod acts of 12th 15th centuries First and foremost among the prince's functions, he was a military leader. He also patronized churches in the city and held court, although it was often presided over by his namestnik or lieutenant when he was personally absent from the city. The posadnik had always to be present in the court and no court decision could be made without his approval. Also, without the posadnik's approval the prince could neither give out Novgorod lands nor issue laws.Valentin Yanin \\"Sources of Novgorod statehood. Besides, the prince could not own land in Novgorod and could not himself collect taxes from the Novgorod lands. He lived from money given to him by the city. According to several r'ads, the prince could not extradite or prosecute a Novgorodian outside of the Novgorodian Land.Paul, \\"Was the Prince of Novgorod a 'Third-rate bureaucrat' after 1136?\\" 100‚Äì107. The princes had two residences, one on the Marketplace (called Yaroslav's Court, after Yaroslav the Wise), and another (–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â–µ / Riurkovo Gorodische) several miles south of the Market Side of the city. The administrative division of Novgorod Republic is not definitely known; the country was divided into several tysyachas (in the core lands of the country) and volosts (lands in the east and north that were being colonised or just paid tribute). The city of Novgorod and its vicinity, as well as a few other towns, were not part of any of those. Pskov achieved autonomy from Novgorod in the 13th century; its independence was confirmed by the Treaty of Bolotovo in 1348. Several other towns had special status as they were owned jointly by Novgorod and one of the neighbouring states. The leaders of Rus during the 15th century after the Mongol yoke had a serious decision to make. Either they could change from the Mongol style of ruling and lean towards a governance resembling Novgorod with its elections and full societal involvement, or they could continue to follow the Mongol style of ruling. Some examples of this form of governance can be seen in some of the court practices adopted by the new government. The practice of Chelobitie, literally meaning, to beat one's head against the ground. This was the way the great Khans demanded the Rus leaders come before them, and this practice was continued.Sixsmith, Martin. \\"Chapter 3.\\" Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East. New York, NY: Overlook Pr., 2012. 30. Print. The next and most striking similarity between these two systems of governments would be the emphasis on an autocratic, militarized state. Economy The marketplace in Novgorod, by Apollinary Vasnetsov. The economy of the Novgorodian Republic included farming and animal husbandry (e.g., the archbishops of Novgorod and others raised horses for the Novgorodian army), while hunting, beekeeping, and fishing were also widespread. In most of the regions of the republic, these different \\"industries\\" were combined with farming. Iron was mined on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Staraya Russa and other localities were known for their saltworks. Flax and hop cultivation were also of significant importance. Countryside products, such as furs, beeswax, honey, fish, lard, flax, and hops, were sold on the market and exported to other Russian cities or abroad. The real wealth of Novgorod, however, came from the fur trade. The city was the main entrep√¥t for trade between Rus' and northwestern Europe. It stood on the northwestern end of the Silk Road from China and at the eastern end of the Baltic trade network established by the Hanseatic League. From Novgorod's northeastern lands (\\"The Lands Beyond the Portages\\" as they were called in the chronicles), the area stretching north of Lakes Ladoga and Onega up to the White Sea and east to the Ural MountainsJanet Martin, Treasure of the Land of Darkness: the Fur Trade and its Significance for Medieval Rus (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985). had so much fur that medieval travel accounts tell of furry animals raining from the sky.Paul, \\"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest,\\" 258. The Novgorodian merchants traded with Swedish, German, and Danish cities. In early years, the Novgorodians sailed the Baltic themselves (several incidents involving Novgorodian merchants in Gotland and Denmark are reported in the Novgorodian First Chronicle). Orthodox churches for Novgorodian merchants have been excavated on Gotland. Likewise, merchants from Gotland had their own St. Olaf church and trading house in Novgorod. However the Hanseatic League disputed the right of the Novgorod merchants to carry out sea trade independently and to deliver cargoes to the West-European ports by their own ships. Society More than a half of all Novgorodian privately owned lands had been concentrated in the hands of some 30‚Äì40 noble boyar families by the 14th‚Äì15th century. These vast estates served as material resources, which secured political supremacy of the boyars. The House of Holy Wisdom (–î–æ–º —Å–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –°–æ—Ñ–∏–∏, Dom Svyatoy Sofiy)‚Äîthe main ecclesiastic establishment of Novgorod‚Äîwas their chief rival in terms of landownership. Its votchinas were located in the most economically developed regions of the Novgorod Land. The Yuriev Monastery, Arkazhsky Monastery, Antoniev Monastery and some other privileged monasteries are known to have been big landowners. There were also the so-called zhityi lyudi (–∂–∏—Ç—å–∏ –ª—é–¥–∏), who owned less land than the boyars, and unprivileged small votchina owners called svoyezemtsy (—Å–≤–æ–µ–∑–µ–º—Ü—ã, or private landowners). The most common form of labor exploitation‚Äîthe system of metayage‚Äîwas typical for the afore-mentioned categories of landowners. Their household economies were mostly serviced by slaves (kholopy), whose number had been constantly decreasing. Along with the metayage, monetary payments also gained significant importance by the 2nd half of the 15th century. 13th- century Novgorod as depicted in Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky (1938) Some scholars argue that the feudal lords tried to legally tie down the peasants to their land. Certain categories of feudally dependent peasants, such as davniye lyudi (–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏–µ –ª—é–¥–∏), polovniki (–ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏), poruchniki (–ø–æ—Ä—É—á–Ω–∏–∫–∏), dolzhniki (–¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∏), were deprived of the right to leave their masters. The boyars and monasteries also tried to restrict other categories of peasants from switching their feudal lords. However, until the late 16th century peasants could leave their land in the weeks preceding and coming after St. George's day in the autumn. Marxist scholars (e.g., Aleksandr Khoroshev) often spoke of class struggle in Novgorod. There were some 80 major uprisings in the republic, which often turned into armed rebellions. The most notable among these took place in 1136, 1207, 1228‚Äì29, 1270, 1418, and 1446‚Äì47. The extent to which these were based on \\"class struggle\\" is unclear. Many were between various boyar factions or, if a revolt did involve the peasants or tradesman against the boyars, it did not consist of the peasants wanting to overthrow the existing social order, but was more often than not a demand for better rule on the part of the ruling class. There did not seem to be a sense that the office of prince should be abolished or that the peasants should be allowed to run the city. Throughout the republican period, the archbishop of Novgorod was the head of the Orthodox church. The Finno-Ugric population of the Novgorod land was undergoing christianisation. The sect of Strigolniki spread to Novgorod from Pskov in the middle of 14th century, its members renouncing ecclesiastic hierarchy, monasticism and sacraments of priesthood, communion, repentance and baptism. Another sect, called the heresy of the Judaizers by its opponents appeared in Novgorod in the second half of 15th century and subsequently enjoyed support at the court in Moscow. Foreign relations During the era of Kievan Rus', Novgorod was a trade hub at the northern end of both the Volga trade route and the \\"route from the Varangians to the Greeks\\" along the Dnieper river system. A vast array of goods were transported along these routes and exchanged with local Novgorod merchants and other traders. The merchants of Gotland retained the Gothic Court trading house well into the 12th century. Later German merchantmen also established tradinghouses in Novgorod. Scandinavian royalty would intermarry with Russian princes and princesses. =Hansa, Sweden and Livonian Order= After the great schism, Novgorod struggled from the beginning of the 13th century against Swedish, Danish, and German crusaders. During the Swedish‚ÄìNovgorodian Wars, the Swedes invaded lands where some of the population had earlier paid tribute to Novgorod. The Germans had been trying to conquer the Baltic region since the late 12th century. Novgorod went to war 26 times with Sweden and 11 times with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. The German knights, along with Danish and Swedish feudal lords, launched a series of uncoordinated attacks in 1240‚Äì1242. Novgorodian sources mention that a Swedish army was defeated in the Battle of the Neva in 1240. The Baltic German campaigns ended in failure after the Battle on the Ice in 1242. After the foundation of the castle of Vyborg in 1293 the Swedes gained a foothold in Karelia. On August 12, 1323, Sweden and Novgorod signed the Treaty of N√∂teborg, regulating their border for the first time. =Mongol invasion and its aftermath= The Novgorod Republic managed to escape the horrors of the Mongol invasion because it was the only Rus principality to preemptively and peacefully submit to the Mongols.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 441. Instead of being formally conquered, the Republic paid a large bribe to Subutai in 1241, agreed to become a vassal, and later began to pay tribute to the khans of the Golden Horde. In 1259, Mongol tax-collectors and census- takers arrived in the city, leading to political disturbances and forcing Alexander Nevsky to punish a number of town officials (he cut off their noses) for defying him as Grand Prince of Vladimir (soon to be the khan's tax- collector in Russia) and his Mongol overlords. In the 14th century, raids by Novgorod pirates, or ushkuiniki,Janet Martin, \\"Les U≈°kujniki de Novgorod: Marchands ou Pirates.\\" Cahiers du Monde Russe et Sovietique 16 (1975): 5-18. sowed fear as far as Kazan and Astrakhan, assisting Novgorod in wars with Muscovy. Culture =Art and iconography= The Republic of Novgorod was famous for its high level of culture in relation to other Russian duchies like Suzdal. A great majority of the most important Eastern artwork of the period came from this city. Citizens of Novgorod were producing large quantities of art, more specifically, religious icons. This high level of artistic production was due to the flourishing economy. Not only would prominent boyar families commission the creation of icons, but artists also had the backing of wealthy merchants and members of the strong artisan class.Viktor Nikitich Lazarev, Gerol πd Ivanovich Vzdornov, and Nancy McDarby, The Rus Icon: From Its Origins to the Sixteenth Century (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical, 1997), 47. Icons became so prominent in Novgorod that by the end of the 13th century a citizen did not have to be particularly rich to buy one; in fact, icons were often produced as exports as well as for churches and homes.Lazarev, Vzdornoc, and McDarby, The Rus Icon, 48. However, scholars today have managed to find and preserve only a small, random assortment of icons made from the 12th century to the 14th century in Novgorod. The icons that do remain show a mixture of traditional Rus style, Palaeologus-Byzantine style (prominent previously in Kiev), and European Romanesque and Gothic style.Anonymous, \\"Novgorod\\" in World Heritage: Archaeological Sites and Urban Centres (Paris: Unesco, 2002), 138. The artists of Novgorod, and their audience, favored saints who provided protection mostly related to the economy. The Prophet Elijah was the lord of thunder who provided rain for the peasants' fields. Saint George, Saint Blaise, and Saints Florus and Laurus all provided some manner of protection over the fields or the animals and herds of the peasants. Saint Paraskeva Pyatnitsa and Saint Anastasia both protected trade and merchants. Saint Nicholas was the patron of carpenters and protected travelers and the suffering. Both Saint Nicholas and the Prophet Elijah also offer protection from fires. Fires were commonplace in the fields and on the streets of the city.Lazarev, Vzdornoc, and McDarby, The Rus Icon, 53. Depictions of these saints retained popularity throughout the entire reign of the Republic. But in the beginning of the 14th century another icon became prominent in the city: the Virgin of Mercy. This icon commemorates the appearance of the Virgin Mary to Andrew Yurodivyi and Epifanii. During this appearance, Mary prays for humankind.Lazarev, Vzdornoc, and McDarby, The Rus Icon, 56. The art movement of Novgorod was essentially destroyed by Moscow after 1478, when a more uniform method for iconography was established throughout Russia.Lazarev, Vzdornoc, and McDarby, The Rus Icon, 67. =Architecture and city layout= The Volkhov River divided the Republic of Novgorod into two halves. The commercial side of the city, which contained the main market, rested on one side of the Volkhov. The St. Sophia Cathedral and an ancient kremlin rested on the other side of the river.Nicholas V. Riasanovsky and Mark D. Steinberg, \\"Lord Novgorod the Great\\" in A History of Russia (New York: Oxford UP, 2011), 75. The cathedral and kremlin were surrounded by a solid ring of city walls, which included a bell tower. Novgorod was filled with and surrounded by churches and monasteries.Anonymous, \\"Novgorod,\\" 143. The city was overcrowded because of its large population of 30,000 people. The wealthy (boyar families, artisans, and merchants) lived in large stone houses inside the city walls, and the poor used whatever space they could find.Riasanovsky and Steinberg, \\"Lord Novgorod the Great,\\" 75. The streets were paved with wood and were accompanied by a wooden water-pipe system, a Byzantine invention to protect against fire.Riasanovsky and Steinberg, \\"Lord Novgorod the Great,\\" 76. The Byzantine style (famous for large domes) and the European Romanesque style influenced the architecture of Novgorod.Anonymous, \\"Novgorod,\\" 183. A number of rich families commissioned churches and monasteries in the city. About 83 churches, almost all of which were built in stone, operated during this period.V. L. Ianin, \\"Medieval Novgorod\\" in The Cambridge History of Russia: From Early Rus' to 1689. Vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008), 208-209. Two prominent styles of churches existed in the Republic of Novgorod. The first style consisted of a single apse with a slanted (lopastnyi) roof. This style was standard throughout Russia during this period. The second style, the Novgorodian style, consisted of three apses and had roofs with arched gables. This second style was prominent in the early years of the Republic of Novgorod and also in the last years of the Republic, when this style was revitalized to make a statement against the rising power of Moscow.Ianin, \\"Medieval Novgorod ,\\" 209. The inside of the churches contained icons, woodcarvings, and church plates.V. K. Laurina and V. A. Pu≈°karev, Novgorod Icons: 12th-17th Century (Leningrad: Aurora, 1980), 21. =Literature and literacy= Chronicles are the earliest kind of literature known to originate in Novgorod, the oldest one being the Novgorod First Chronicle. Other genres appear in the XIV and XV centuries: travel diaries (such as the account of Stefan the Novgorodian's travel to Constantinople for trade purposes), legends about local posadniks, saints and Novgorod's wars and victories. The events of many bylinas - traditional Russian oral epic poems - take place in Novgorod. Their protagonists include a merchant and adventurer Sadko and daredevil Vasily Buslayev. Scholars generally believe that the Republic of Novgorod had an unusually high level of literacy for the time period. Archeologists found over one thousand birch-bark texts, all dating from the 11th to the 15th centuries, in towns dating back to the early Rus'. Roughly 950 of these texts were from Novgorod. Archeologists and scholars assume that fires destroyed a majority of Novgorod's written works and that about 20,000 similar texts still remain hidden in the city.Ianin, \\"Medieval Novgorod,\\" 206. Novgorod citizens from all class levels, from boyars to peasants and artisans to merchants, participated in writing these texts. Even women wrote a significant amount of the manuscripts. This collection of birch-bark texts consists of religious documents, writings from the city's archbishops, business messages from all classes, and travelogues, especially of religious pilgrimages. The citizens of Novgorod wrote in a realistic and businesslike fashion. In addition to the birch-bark texts, archeologists also found the oldest surviving Russian manuscript in Novgorod: three wax tablets with Psalms 67, 75, and 76, dating from the first quarter of the 11th century.Riasanovsky and Steinberg, \\"Lord Novgorod the Great,\\" 80. Fall of the Republic Martha the Mayoress at the Destruction of the Novgorod veche, by Klavdiy Lebedev Tver, Muscovy, and Lithuania fought over control of Novgorod and its enormous wealth from the 14th century. Upon becoming the Grand Prince of Vladimir, Mikhail Yaroslavich of Tver sent his governors to Novgorod. A series of disagreements with Mikhail pushed Novgorod towards closer ties with Muscovy during the reign of Grand Prince George. In part, Tver's proximity (the Tver Principality is contiguous with the Novgorodian Land) threatened Novgorod. It was feared that a Tverite prince would annex Novgorodian lands and thus weaken the Republic. At the time, though, Muscovy did not border Novgorod, and since the Muscovite princes were further afield, they were more acceptable as princes of Novgorod. They could come to Novgorod's aid when needed but would be too far away to meddle too much in the Republic's affairs. As Muscovy grew in strength, however, the Muscovite princes became a serious threat to Novgorod. Ivan Kalita, Simeon the Proud and other Muscovite monarchs sought to limit Novgorod's independence. In 1397, a critical conflict took place between Muscovy and Novgorod, when Moscow annexed the Dvina Lands along the course of the Northern Dvina. These lands were crucial to Novgorod's well-being since much of the city's furs came from there.Martin, Treasure of the Land of DarknessPaul, \\"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest,\\" 258‚Äì259. This territory was returned to Novgorod the following year. Resisting the Muscovite oppression, the government of Novgorod sought an alliance with Poland‚ÄìLithuania. Most Novgorodian boyars wished to maintain the Republic's independence since if Novgorod were to be conquered, the boyars' wealth would flow to the grand prince and his Muscovite boyars, and the Novgorodians would fall into decline. Most of them didn't earn enough to pay for war.Richard Pipes, Russia Under the Old Regime, page 80 According to tradition, Marfa Boretskaya, the wife of Posadnik Isak Boretskii, was the main proponent of an alliance with Poland-Lithuania to save the Republic. According to this legend, Boretskaya invited the Lithuanian princeling Mikhail Olelkovich and asked him to become her husband and the ruler of Novgorod. She also concluded an alliance with Casimir, the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. The prospects of changing allegiance in favor of the allied Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania caused a major commotion among the commoners. Janet Martin and Gail Lenhoff have recently argued that Boretskaya was scapegoated, probably by Archbishop Feofil (r. 1470‚Äì1480) in order to shift the blame from him for his betrayal of the terms of the Treaty of Yazhelbitsy, which forbade Novgorod from conducting foreign affairs without grand princely approval.Gail Lenhoff and Janet Martin. \\"Marfa Boretskaia, Posadnitsa of Novgorod: A Reconsideration of Her Legend and Her Life.\\" Slavic Review 59, no. 2 (2000): 343‚Äì368. While the extent of Boretskaya's role in the Lithuanian party is probably exaggerated, Novgorod did indeed try to turn to the King of Poland. A draft treaty, allegedly found among the loot after the Battle of Shelon River, was drawn up between Casimir and the Novgorodians.Paul, \\"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod,\\" 262. Muscovite authorities saw Novgorod's behavior as a repudiation of the Treaty of Yazhelbitsy and went to war against the city. The army of Moscow won a decisive victory in the Battle of Shelon River on July 1471, which severely limited Novgorod's freedom to act thereafter, although the city maintained its formal independence for the next seven years. In 1478, Ivan III sent his army to take the city. He destroyed the veche, tore down the Veche bell, the ancient symbol of participatory governance, civil society, and legal rights, and destroyed the library and archives, thus ending the independence of Novgorod.Sixsmith, Martin. \\"Chapter 3.\\" Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East. New York, NY: Overlook Pr., 2012. 41. Print. After the takeover, Ivan took 81.7% of Novgorod's land, half for himself and the rest for his allies.Richard Pipes, Russia Under the Old Regime, page 93 The Novgorod Chronicle which had been critical of Ivan III before the fall of Novgorod thus described the conquest in its aftermath, justifying it on the grounds of purported conversion of Novgorodians to the Catholic faith:Sixsmith, Martin. \\"Chapter 3.\\" Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East.

He first came to prominence as a member of the band Hello Sailor after playing with Christchurch top 40 band Beam. After Hello Sailor, Lyon formed Coup D'√âtat with Jan Preston, Neil Hannan and Steve Osborne (who was replaced by Paul Dunningham after a short time). They were awarded the 1981 RIANZ Single of the Year for \\"Dr I Like Your Medicine\\". The band split the following year. In 1982 Graham Brazier formed the Legionnaires and Lyon joined a revised line-up, but Brazier suddenly formed a new band. Lyon joined Dave McArtney in the Pink Flamingos for a short time. He appeared in the feature film Should I Be Good in 1984, playing Nat Goodman, a former drug dealer just released from prison. Nat sang in nightclubs so Lyon also contributed music to the film. Hello Sailor reformed for the opening of the renovated Gluepot in 1985 and, following the success of the performances, began touring again. Lyon has an MCPA (Hons) (Master of Creative & Performing Arts) from the University of Auckland and is currently Director of MAINZ (Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand). In May 2017, according to musician Delaney Davidson, Lyon is recording a solo album.

The ranks at that time were deliberately chosen so that they did not correspond with military ranking (with the exception of Sergeant), because of fears of a paramilitary force. Rank insignia Badges of rank are usually worn on the epaulettes. However, when in their formal uniform sergeants wear their rank insignia on their upper sleeves. When police tunics had closed collars (not open collars as worn with ties), constables and sergeants did not wear epaulettes but had their divisional call number on their collar (hence they are still often referred to as collar numbers). Sergeants wore their stripes on their upper sleeve. Inspectors and more senior ranks wore epaulettes at a much earlier stage, although they once wore their rank insignia on their collars. Most forces no longer use divisional call numbers, and retain only the collar number and rank insignia. =Great Britain= Senior officers usually wear distinguishing marks around the outer edge of the peaks of their caps (or under the capbadge for female officers, who do not wear peaked caps). Normally this is a raised black band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver (gold in the City of London Police) band for superintendents and chief superintendents, and a row of silver oak leaves for chief officers. Chief constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police, and all commissioner ranks of the Metropolitan Police wear oakleaves on both the outer and inner edges of their peaks (or a double row beneath the capbadge for female officers). In Scotland, however, the mark is a silver band for inspectors and chief inspectors, a silver band and silver oakleaves on the outer and inner edges of the peak respectively for superintendents and chief superintendents, and silver oakleaves on the outer and inner edges of the peak for all chief officers. Additionally, officers at or above the rank of commander or assistant chief constable wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are patterned after those worn by general officers of the British Army and Royal Marines; the police versions, however, are of silver on black (gold on black in the City of London Police) rather than gold on red, in keeping with the police uniform colours. The ranks below are used by all territorial forces in the United Kingdom, and the specialist national forces: the British Transport Police, Ministry of Defence Police, and Civil Nuclear Constabulary.CNC ranks listed here on their website. Other specialist forces, and those outside of the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Gibraltar) use the same general system, but often have fewer senior ranks. Chief constable is the title of the head of each United Kingdom territorial police force except the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police, which are headed by commissioners. Ranks above chief superintendent are usually non- operational management roles, and are often referred to as \\"chief officer\\" ranks, but the longer phrase \\"chief police officer\\" or similar in legislation is specifically a commissioner or chief constable, a \\"senior police officer\\" being their immediate deputy.Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is often considered to be the highest police rank within the United Kingdom,Stephenson is named new Met Police chief, The Independent although in reality every chief constable and the two commissioners are supreme over their own forces and are not answerable to any other officer; there is also the matter that (in the absence of mutual aid arrangements and similar) a police officer of any rank only holds the office of constable in any of the three UK national jurisdictions in which they have been attested thus implicitly limiting any general comparison or ranking to a chief police officer's home jurisdiction. Epaulettes are normally black with white sewn on or silver metal insignia, although high-visibility uniforms are often yellow with black insignia. Epaulette insignia Uniform insignia The rank of an officer can be found in varying details of the uniform such as headgear, sleeve patches and tunic collar details. Insignia on hats and uniforms can vary between forces within the UK and the following tables below will not accurately represent all constabularies within the UK. British police variations =City of London Police= City of London Police insignia is gold where that of other forces is silver. For example, rank insignia and collar numbers on epaulettes are gold, as are the bands and oak leaves on the caps of senior officers, and officers of or above the rank of commander wear gold-on-black gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The City of London Police also previously had variations for some acting ranks such as sergeant and inspector: acting sergeants wore their chevrons above their divisional letters (or later \\"CP\\" for all officers, following the abolition of the force's divisions), whereas substantive sergeants wear them below their collar number. Acting inspectors were denoted by a crown in the place of their divisional letters, whilst keeping their collar number and chevrons. The City of London Police use a different colour scheme for their police headwear. Instead of the Black and white Sillitoe \\"tartan\\" they use Red and White. =Metropolitan Police= The Metropolitan Police uses different ranks above chief superintendent. The fabric used in the crowns is blue, whereas other police forces use red. =Police Scotland= Police Scotland headwear is slightly different for the following ranks: *Inspectors and chief inspectors wear a hat with a silver band instead of a black one. *Superintendents and chief superintendents wear a row of oak leaves within the silver band. *Assistant chief constables and deputy chief constables wear two rows of oak leaves. =Merseyside Police= Merseyside Police inspectors and chief inspectors wear similar hats to superintendents in the diagram above. Special Constabularies insignia Special constabulary epaulettes frequently bear the letters \\"SC\\" (with or without a crown above) to differentiate them from regular officers. Within the City of London Special Constabulary is the Honourable Artillery Company Specials; members of this unit wear HAC on the shoulders in addition to other insignia.https://www.hac.org.uk/home/special-constabulary/ Senior special constables wear the same markings on their hats as equivalent regular ranks. There is a large variation in the design of epaulettes used across Great Britain for specials. This has been recognised at national level and as part of the Special Constabulary National Strategy 2018‚Äì2023 the structure and insignia is under review with the intention to standardise. Other special constabularies use combinations of bars, half bars, pips, crowns, laurel wreaths, collar numbers, force crests and the SC identity (with or without a crown) to distinguish ranks (and/or role). =Northern Ireland= The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), founded in June 1922, was headed by an inspector- general and had a different rank structure until 1 June 1970, when it fully adopted the rank system used elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The RUC was succeeded in November 2001 by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which uses the same ranks, but has a different version of the rank insignia, with the star from the PSNI badge replacing the crown.Police Service of Northern Ireland: Badges of Rank Unusually, the star is worn below the pip by chief superintendents and by the chief constable, who wears both symbols above his tipstaves. The PSNI has retained the RUC's distinctive inverted (point-up) sergeants' chevrons, worn on the lower sleeve in formal uniform. PSNI officers do not wear the custodian helmet and female officers wear a different hat from other forces. Epaulette insignia The PSNI rank structure and epaulette insignia is the same as the territorial police in Great Britain, except that the crown is replaced with the design from the PSNI badge and sergeants' chevrons are point up. In addition to the epaulettes being a green colour rather than a black, this is to match their green uniforms. =Isle of Man Constabulary= Epaulette insignia The Isle of Man police ranks follow the structure of other British police rank structures however it is notably missing the Chief Superintendent and Assistant Chief Constable ranks within their own structure. The epaulettes for the constables and sergeants also have an addition of the Isle of Man Constabulary logo and motto above their collar numbers. =Miscellaneous police forces= There are, in the United Kingdom, a number of miscellaneous constabularies. These are not operated, regulated or funded by the Home Office, although they are fully authorised (by Act of Parliament) establishments. In general, they provide the policing for ports, docks, tunnels, or other particular institutions. Although these forces tend to require high standards of training and accountability, which closely mirror those of the Home Office police forces, they are usually much smaller in terms of personnel, and therefore utilise fewer of the 'standard' ranks. History of police ranks All police forces have used a wide variety of ranks to meet their organisational needs, especially the Metropolitan Police Service. Ranks have been created, abolished, amalgamated and sometimes revived during the history of British policing. \\"MET only\\" means they are specific for the Metropolitan Police. =Defunct rank insignia= Powers In law, every member of a police force is a Constable whatever their actual rank, in the sense that, despite being a low-ranking or high- ranking officer, all have the same powers of arrest. The basic police powers of arrest and search of an ordinary constable are identical to those of a superintendent or chief constable; however certain higher ranks are given administrative powers to authorise certain police actions. In England and Wales, these include the powers to: * authorise the continued detention of up to 24 hours of a person arrested for an offence and brought to a police station (granted to sergeants and above at designated police stations), * authorise section 18 (1) PACE house searches (granted to inspectors and above), or * extend the length of prisoner detention to 36 hours (granted to superintendents), *extend the length of bail from a police station to three months (granted to superintendents). Some authorities are matters of force or national or force policy and not subject to law, such as authorising the use of spike strips, and authorising the use of safe controlled crashes of pursued vehicles, by trained traffic police officers. In relation to police officers of the Home Office or territorial police forces of England and Wales, section 30 of the Police Act 1996 states that \\"a member of a police force shall have all the powers and privileges of a Constable throughout England and Wales and the adjacent United Kingdom waters\\". Police officers do not need to be on duty to exercise their powers and can act off duty if circumstances require it (technically placing themselves back on duty). Officers from the police forces of Scotland and Northern Ireland and non-territorial special police forces have different jurisdictions. See List of police forces in the United Kingdom for a fuller description of jurisdictions.  Detectives  Officers holding ranks up to and including chief superintendent who are members of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or Special Branch (and certain other units) have the prefix \\"detective\\" before their rank. Due to the nature of their duties, these officers generally wear plain clothes (except for ceremonial purposes) and so do not wear the corresponding rank insignia; however, they still operate within the same structure as their uniformed counterparts. In the United Kingdom, detective ranks are not superior to those of uniformed officers and a detective has the same powers and authority as a uniformed officer of the same rank. The \\"detective\\" prefix designates that the officer has received suitable training and passed related examinations to conduct criminal investigations.Mental Health Cop‚ÄîPolice Ranks and Roles Explained Trainee, temporary and acting ranks Constables who are training to become detective constables sometimes bear the title trainee investigator (T/I) or trainee detective constable (T/DC). The prefix \\"temporary\\" before a rank (e.g. temporary detective sergeant, abbreviated T/DS) denotes an officer who has been temporarily promoted to a rank (and so who does actually hold that rank, albeit on a temporary basis), whilst the prefix \\"acting\\" (e.g. acting inspector, abbreviated A/Insp) denotes an officer who is performing the role of a higher rank than the one actually held (sometimes informally termed \\"acting up\\"). Temporary ranks are often used for set periods (e.g. a six-month appointment to a particular role), whereas acting ranks, although sometimes held for extended periods, are often used for a very short time (e.g. a single shift when additional supervisory officers are required, or to replace an officer on short-term leave). Under section 107 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (England and Wales only), sergeants and chief inspectors may be designated (by an officer of at least the rank of superintendent) to exercise the powers of an inspector or a superintendent respectively. Such a designation will generally accompany such an officer being given an acting rank, so for most operational purposes there is no difference between substantive, temporary and acting ranks at Inspector and above (although there may be differences as to pay, pensions and insignia). On the other hand, under section 36 of that Act, only substantive sergeants may be appointed custody officers. Public Order Roles and Rank Insignia Public Order and Public Safety (POPS) events and incidents have colour coded rank slides to denote command and support roles. Bronze commanders can be of varying ranks and not just C/Insp rank as shown below. Tactical advisers can also be of differing events, but are most commonly PCs or Sergeants. It is a requirement under the College of Policing Public Order Manual that all officers, regardless of rank, display an identifying number on their epaulettes. Therefore, ranks such as Inspector have collar/warrant numbers displayed on their public order colour coded epaulettes that they might not have as part of their normal uniform. Identification numbers All officers have a unique identification number. These are usually referred to as shoulder or collar numbers, referring to the fact that they were once worn on the uniform collar and later on the epaulettes by constables and sergeants. Uniformed officers in many forces still wear them on the epaulettes, but other forces have badges or other ways of displaying their identification numbers. Kent Police, for instance, refers to its numbers as force numbers and officers wear them on a velcro tab on their stab vest or on a badge attached to their shirt or tunic. Officers in all forces of the rank of inspector or above do not usually wear their numbers. In most forces these identification numbers are simple numbers, with one to five digits. The Metropolitan Police, being a much bigger force, uses a different system: * Sergeant: borough code and one, two or three digits * Constable: borough code and three or four digits * Special Constable: borough code and four digits, usually beginning with the number 5 (8 for Traffic/Transport or 9 for specialist units) * PCSO: borough code and four digits, the first digit being a 7 The borough code is a two-letter code which follows the digits (but displayed above them on epaulettes). Before the reorganisation into boroughs, each division had a different code, with sergeants having two-digit numbers and constables having three-digit numbers. A few other forces still use divisional codes. Special constables There are various grades of special constable which assist in the tasking and management of the constabulary. The ranks are management grades; those holding them are not \\"sergeants\\" or \\"inspectors\\" for the purposes of the law (for example, authorisations to order the removal of disguises or to set up roadblocks). Originally, specials held the same ranks and used the same rank insignia as regular officers, but there was a general shift to distinct terms such as \\"area officer\\" and \\"divisional officer\\" in the 1980s. However, since 2000, the National Policing Improvement Agency has encouraged special constabularies to return to rank structures and epaulette insignia identical to their regular counterparts. Although most forces have now reverted to regular rank titles (with the prefix \\"special\\"), only some have reverted to regular rank insignia. Senior special constables have no authority over regular officers, but very experienced officers may occasionally be given administrative supervision of mixed units of regular and special constables for certain events where no regular supervisory officer is available. Police Community Support Officers (PCSO) Police Community Support Officers, in general, do not have a rank system: their epaulettes simply bear the words \\"POLICE COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICER\\" and their shoulder number, or, in the Metropolitan Police, a borough identification code and shoulder number. South Yorkshire Police and Kent Police have PCSO supervisors. In South Yorkshire they wear a bar above the words \\"Police Community Support Officer Supervisor\\" and the shoulder number.

The rank insignia is worn on epaulettes on the shirts for formal occasions or ironed onto polo shirts which are used for less formal occasions. In 2018, Hampshire, Thames Valley Police, Sussex and Surrey standardised on uniforms and rank slides, although proliferation of the new uniform has been limited within Hampshire. =Leicestershire Police= Head police cadet is the highest rank, typically assisted by two deputies. 150px =Thames Valley Police= In Thames Valley Police, the ranks are as follows: cadet, team leader, deputy head cadet, and head cadet. Traffic wardens Traffic wardens were administered by the police and exercised some police powers to control traffic or issue fixed penalty notices for traffic offences. Very few police Traffic Wardens now exist with a legacy of only 10 police traffic wardens remaining in England & Wales. Section 46 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 has in effect abolished police traffic wardens allowing police to focus on their core duties. The duties of traffic wardens have been passed to local authority civil enforcement officers (formerly parking attendants) who, under decriminalised parking enforcement, have powers to issue penalty charge notices for breaches of parking laws on highways or in local authority car parks and compel the production of a disabled parking permit (blue badge) for inspection. A similar situation has developed in Scotland with the functions of traffic wardens been taken over by local councils. In many areas parking legislation has been decriminalised and is enforced solely by council-employed parking attendants.

Originally a member of new wave band Japan (and their brief 1989‚Äì1991 reincarnation as Rain Tree Crow), more recently he is known as the keyboard player in the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, which he joined in 1993.Hayes, Kelvin \\"Richard Barbieri Biography\\", AllMusic. Retrieved 17 August 2014 Biography =Japan (1974‚Äì1982)= Barbieri started his musical career with the group Japan who formed in 1974; Barbieri joined in 1975 following earlier attendances at rehearsals as a friend of the group. In 1977 the band was signed to the Hansa/Ariola label and began work on a debut album, which was released in 1978. Japan went on to record five studio albums culminating in Tin Drum which stayed in the UK Albums Chart for a year. They were one of the most successful chart bands in Europe and Asia in 1982. The band split up in December 1982 at the height of their popularity after a world tour that year. =Guest appearances and Dolphin Brothers (1983‚Äìpresent)= After the break-up of Japan, Barbieri continued his association with David Sylvian, playing on the latter's early solo albums (and on the 1988 in Praise of Shamans tour). During this time he worked alongside such other innovators as Holger Czukay, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Robert Fripp. In 1984 he started a long musical association with another Japan colleague, Steve Jansen. This has produced six collaborative albums to date, under the name The Dolphin Brothers (Catch the Fall, 1987) and later as Jansen / Barbieri (including Worlds in a Small Room, 1985, Stories Across Borders, 1993, Other Worlds in a Small Room, 1996, and Stone to Flesh, 1997). =Rain Tree Crow (1989‚Äì1991)= In late 1989, the members of Japan (minus guitarist Rob Dean) reunited under the name Rain Tree Crow to make new recordings for Virgin. This resulted in a single eponymous album which extended the work of late Japan and the solo/collective work of all four members, featuring a variety of influences from pop to art rock, jazz, ambient and world music. Other contributors to the album included Bill Nelson. Rain Tree Crow charted in 1991 in the UK Top 25 and brought critical acclaim. The group parted company shortly after recording the album, for which there was no supporting tour. However, the project was key to the reuniting of Jansen, Barbieri and Karn as a creative unit (sometimes referred to as \\"JBK\\"). =No-Man (1992)= The next work by Jansen, Barbieri and Karn was as the rhythm section for British art-pop band No-Man, who recruited them for a 1992 UK tour and for recordings which later appeared on the Loveblows & Lovecries album and on the \\"Painting Paradise\\" and \\"Sweetheart Raw\\" EPs (one of these EP pieces, the 20-plus-minute \\"Heaven Taste\\", later appeared on the album of the same name). This marked Barbieri's first work with Steven Wilson, with whom he would then go on to work in Porcupine Tree. =Medium Productions (1993‚Äì2003)= In 1993, Barbieri formed the Medium Productions label in 1993 with Jansen and Karn. They commenced with the Jansen/Barbieri/Karn album Beginning to Melt (a collection of varied pieces including some trio work and other recordings featuring various permutations of the basic trio with other collaborators including David Torn and Robbie Aceto). Thirteen diverse albums were released during a ten-year period; Jansen and Barbieri's collaboration with DJ Takemura on the album Changing Hands being one of the highlights. During this period Barbieri also made two other collaborative albums, one with his wife Suzanne J. Barbieri under the name Indigo Falls (1996), and one with Tim Bowness from the band No-Man titled Flame (1994). =Porcupine Tree (1993‚Äì2010)= In late 1993, Barbieri joined the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree (having previously played as a guest performer on the album Up the Downstair). The band released eight studio albums to increasingly greater chart success, and toured in support of many of them. Initially employing many aspects of psychedelic rock, they later transitioned to a more pop-oriented style before settling on progressive metal. Their first major success was the album In Absentia, which enjoyed chart success around Europe with sales of over 120,000. The following studio albums Deadwing and Fear of a Blank Planet met even greater success, charting highly worldwide. Increased radio airtime and favourable mainstream magazine reviews and interviews further increased their public exposure. The band transitioned somewhat away from metal with their last album, The Incident, with leader Steven Wilson expressing a desire to enter a different genre. The band members are currently concentrating on solo projects and have no immediate plans to work together in the future. =With Steve Hogarth (2012)= Richard Barbieri collaborated with Steve Hogarth on the album Not The Weapon But The Hand, which was released by Kscope Records in 2012, but a proposed tour was cancelled for financial issues. Barbieri wrote the music and Hogarth provided the lyrics for the album. = Solo recordings (2004 ‚Äì present) = Richard Barbieri has released three solo albums to date, Things Buried, 2004/5, Stranger Inside, 2008, and Planets + Persona, 2017. In January 2019, Barbieri released 'Variants 1 + 2' on vinyl only. The double LP set features new compositions, improvisations, live performances and reworkings of older material. It is the first compilation set to be released in a series. =Lustans Lakejer (1982/2017)= In 1982, Richard Barbieri produced the album En plats i solen by the Japan-influenced Swedish band Lustans Lakejer. In 2017, he joined them on a Swedish tour to perform the album in its entirety. Other activities Aside from recording and touring, Barbieri has written articles on analogue synthesis for various publications; composed music for film; programs for music software and synthesizer manufacturers. He guests with The Bays, an electronic improvisational group. Recent work with The Bays includes two Radio One sessions for the late John Peel and concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Brighton Dome. Richard and The Bays performed an improvised soundtrack to Run Lola Run in Darling Harbour, Sydney in 2009. He also undertakes occasional keyboards duties for the live outings of Marillion vocalist Steve Hogarth's fronted H-Band, appearing on the 2002 album Live Body, Live Spirit.

He was assistant to the anatomist Johannes Peter M√ºller and later became curator of the Berlin Zoological Museum. Encouraged by M√ºller and the explorer Alexander von Humboldt, Peters travelled to Mozambique via Angola in September 1842, exploring the coastal region and the Zambesi River. He returned to Berlin with an enormous collection of natural history specimens, which he then described in Naturwissenschaftliche Reise nach Mossambique... in den Jahren 1842 bis 1848 ausgef√ºhrt (1852‚Äì1882). The work was comprehensive in its coverage, dealing with mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, river fish, insects and botany. He replaced Martin Lichtenstein as curator of the museum in 1858, and in the same year he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In a few years time, he greatly increased the Berlin Museum's herpetological collection to a size comparable to those of Paris and London. Herpetology was Peters' main interest, and he described 122 new genera and 649 species from around the world. Eponyms Wilhelm Peters is commemorated in the scientific names of several species of reptiles, including Andinosaura petrorum, Anolis petersii, Geophis petersii, Hebius petersii, Morenia petersi, and Tracheloptychus petersi. He is also commemorated in the specific name of an African freshwater elephantfish, Gnathonemus petersii, known commonly as Peters' elephantnose fish. Peters Bay in NE Greenland was named after him by Carl Koldewey during the 1869‚Äì1870 Second German North Polar Expedition. Author abbreviation Sometimes, W.

The village lies about to the east of the Rh√¥ne and north of the town of Avignon. In the 2012 census the commune had a population of 2,179. A ruined medieval castle sits above the village and dominates the landscape to the south. It was built in the 14th century for Pope John XXII, the second of the popes to reside in Avignon. None of the subsequent Avignon popes stayed in Ch√¢teauneuf but after the schism of 1378 the antipope Clement VII sought the security of the castle. With the departure of the popes the castle passed to the archbishop of Avignon, but it was too large and too expensive to maintain and was used as a source of stone for building work in the village. At the time of the Revolution the buildings were sold off and only the donjon was preserved. During the Second World War an attempt was made to demolish the donjon with dynamite by German soldiers but only the northern half was destroyed; the southern half remained intact. Almost all the cultivable land is planted with grapevines. The commune is famous for the production of red wine classified as Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e which is produced from grapes grown in the commune of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and in portions of four adjoining communes. Toponym The first mention of the village is in a Latin document from 1094 that uses the name Castro Novo. The term castrum or castro in the 11th century was used to denote a fortified village, rather than a castle (castellum). The current French name of \\"Ch√¢teauneuf\\" (English: \\"New Castle\\") is derived from this early Latin name and not from the ruined 14th-century castle that towers above the village. Just over a century later in 1213 the village was referred to as Castronovum Calcernarium. Other early documents use Castronovo Caussornerio or Castrum Novum Casanerii. The official French name became Ch√¢teauneuf Calcernier. The word 'Calcernier' comes from the presence of important lime kilns in the village. Calcernarium is derived from the Latin calx for lime and cernere means sift or sieve. From the 16th century the village was often referred to as \\"Ch√¢teauneuf du Pape\\" or \\"Ch√¢teauneuf Calcernier dit de Pape\\", because of the connection with Pope John XXII, but it was not until 1893 that the official name was changed from \\"Ch√¢teauneuf Calcernier\\" to \\"Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape\\".. History =Early settlement= Saint Th√©odoric The earliest settlement is believed to have been near the Chapel Saint-Th√©odoric, to the east of the current village center. This Romanesque chapel was erected by the monks of the abbey of Saint-Th√©odoric in Avignon at the end of the 10th or the beginning of the 11th century and is the oldest building in the commune. Although the village lay within the Comtat Venaissin, it was one of the fiefs of the bishop of Avignon and thus had a special status. The bishop of Avignon also held the fiefs of Gigognan and B√©darrides. In the second half of the 11th century a fortified village was built higher up the hill by the Viscount Rostaing B√©ranger in the fiefdom of his brother, the bishop of Avignon. The wall of the present church building formed part of the fortification and the arrowslits in the clock tower are still visible. Two towers and other vestiges of these early fortifications have survived. The new village would have contained a suitable fortified residence for the bishop which is believed to have been located between the church and the site of the later castle. In 1238 the bishop of Avignon obtained an important privilege from the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (r. 1195‚Äì1250). Salt that was shipped on the Rh√¥ne and landed at Ch√¢teauneuf would not be subject to tax. As a result, the trade in salt became a considerable source of revenue for the village. =Avignon popes= Bertrand de Got, archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected pope in 1305, and took the name of Clement V. He transferred the papacy to Avignon in 1309. The register of pontifical letters reveals that Clement V visited Ch√¢teauneuf on several occasions, sometimes for long periods. While in the village he would have been a guest at the bishop's residence. In 1312 he stayed in the village from 6‚Äì22 November. In 1313 he returned from 9 May to 1 July and again from 19 October to 4 December. The following year, 1314, he was in Ch√¢teauneuf from 24‚Äì30 March. He died in the castle of Roquemaure on the opposite bank of the Rh√¥ne on 7 April 1314. The next pope, Jacques Du√®ze, was elected in 1316 and took the name John XXII. After his coronation in Lyon on 5 September 1316, he travelled down the Rh√¥ne and spent 10 days in Ch√¢teauneuf before he arrived in Avignon. He had served as the bishop of Avignon between 1310 and 1313 and while bishop had also been the seigneur of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. He had arranged for his nephew Jacques de Via to succeed him as bishop. But on the death of his nephew in 1317 he chose not to appoint a successor, so during his papacy the village belonged directly to the pope. John XXII initiated a large number of building projects, including additions to the Palais des Papes in Avignon as well as defensive castles at Barbentane, B√©darrides, Noves and Sorgues. In 1317, work began on the construction of the castle in Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. John XXII derived little benefit from the new castle, which was not completed until 1333, a year before his death. The ruins of the castle are now a prominent feature of the village. There is no record of the next Avignon pope, Benedict XII (1334‚Äì1342) having ever stayed in this castle, but in 1335 he granted the village the right to have a ship mill on the Rh√¥ne, a market every Tuesday and two fairs during the year. He did not keep the post of bishop of Avignon and appointed a new bishop to replace himself in 1336. None of the following four popes stayed in Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape either, but after the schism of the Catholic Church in 1378, the Avignon antipope Clement VII frequently sought the security of the castle and from 1385 to 1387 had improvements carried out on the building. In the 14th century the presence of the pope in Avignon and construction of the castle brought considerable prosperity to the village. The economy was based on agriculture, but the villagers also possessed lime kilns and the local merchants supplied roof tiles for the Palais des Papes in Avignon and floor tiles for the castle being built in Barbentane. The village outgrew the mid-11th century ramparts and houses began to be built outside the walls. In 1381 the village obtained permission to impose a local tax to fund the construction of a new system of fortifications around the village. These defensive towers have all disappeared except for the Portalet tower in the Rue des Papes, but parts of the walls remain. Pope John XXII's castle Surviving south wall of the donjon =Construction= In 1317, one year after his election, Pope John XXII ordered the construction of a castle at the top of the hill above the village. Some of the stone may have been from a local quarry but most was probably imported from Courth√©zon. The mortar and the roof tiles would have been manufactured in the village. To provide water, between August 1318 and July 1319, a large deep well was dug in the courtyard to the northeast of the donjon. According to the papal accounts, much of the work was completed by 1322, but in 1332 there is an entry for the purchase of timber from Liguria for four towers. The castle not only had a defensive role, but was also designed to serve as a summer residence. There was a garden on the west side and a 10 hectare park to the north enclosed by high walls in which vines, olive trees and fruit trees were cultivated. =Neglect= With the departure of the popes the castle became part of the fief of the bishop and, after 1475, the archbishop of Avignon, but it was much too big and expensive for them to maintain. The captain in charge of the village's defences lived in the castle but there was no permanent garrison, and most of the buildings were allowed to deteriorate. In the 16th century Huguenots occupied Ch√¢teauneuf for several months during the Wars of Religion. In March 1563, they pillaged the village and set fire to the church and parts of the castle including the apartments of the pope. The extent of the damage is not known. During the 17th century, and perhaps earlier, the ruined buildings of the castle were used as a source of stone for the construction of houses in the village. The community also used the stone to repair the ramparts (18 to 20 cartloads in 1717) and to repair the church in 1781. At the time of the Revolution the castle had not been inhabited for a number of years. The buildings and the adjoining parkland were put up for sale and bought in July 1797 by Jean-Baptiste Establet, a farmer in the village. The following year, these were resold in 33 equal parts. By 1848 most of the castle had been destroyed by the purchasers. The mayor forbade the destruction of the donjon and in May 1892 the castle was listed as one of the French Historical Monuments. During the Second World War, the donjon was used as an observation post by German soldiers. In August 1944, just before their departure, they attempted to demolish the building with dynamite but by chance, only the northern half of the tower was destroyed, leaving the southern half as it appears today. In the 1960s the municipality constructed a meeting hall within the ancient ruined cellar of the castle. =Buildings= Drawing from the Album Laincel that dates from the second half of the 17th century There are no surviving plans of the castle from the 14th century. The earliest depiction is an anonymous drawing from the Album Laincel in the collection of the Mus√©e Calvet in Avignon that dates from the second half of the 17th century. By this time the castle had not been properly maintained for three centuries and the drawing is probably an interpretation by the artist of the surviving structure. Another source of information is a plan of the village from the 1813 cadastre which indicates the position of some of the buildings but not their original function. The appearance of the donjon before its destruction in 1944 is known from old photographs. The image has been flipped horizontally. The main entrance to the castle was just above the village and consisted of two successive gatehouses. The first was on the path up from the church and the second was just to the east of the donjon. The vulnerable north side of the castle would have been protected by a deep ditch. The northern entrance was defended by a tower and was probably accessed by a drawbridge. Very little is known about the buildings of the castle other than the ruined donjon and papal apartments. The castle contained a chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine but the location is uncertain. The donjon had a ground floor with a low barrel vaulted ceiling and two upper levels with rib vaulted ceilings. The large roof terrace was surrounded by a machicolated battlement. The floors were connected by a stone staircase built into the thickness of the western wall. The entrance to the tower on the east side was protected by an unusually tall bret√®che. A similar bret√®che survives above the entrance to the Tour Philippe-le-Bel in Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon. The two large ruined walls to the west of the donjon formed part of a rectangular building reserved for the pope and his close associates. The large ground-floor room was 26 m in length, 9 m in width and 5.5 m in height. The ceiling was supported by wooden beams with three central columns. The floor was paved with large stone slabs. This room, together with a smaller room to the north, were probably used for storage. On the first floor was the great hall of the castle in which banquets would have been held. It had the same dimensions as the ground floor storeroom but with a higher ceiling (6.5 m). It was lit by four large rectangular windows providing views over the Rh√¥ne valley. There were also three smaller windows to increase the ventilation, two facing west and one facing south. The walls were decorated with frescoes and a band of large red, bistre and black roses. A door at the north end of the hall opened into a well-lit smaller room with a chimney. The main entrance to the hall was on the east side near the donjon and close to the modern steps. The top floor of the building was lit by three large windows provided with benches and three smaller rectangular windows. The irregular pattern of the windows suggests that there were several rooms, perhaps apartments for the pope. The tiled roof with two equal slopes was entirely protected by the large outer walls. =Tiles= An archaeological excavation carried out in 1960 in the basement of the ruined rectangular building recovered a number of small glazed terracotta floor tiles. They date from the first half of the 14th century and would have originally decorated the main hall on the first floor. The tiles are square, 125‚Äì130 mm on a side and 20 mm in thickness. They are decorated in a Hispano-Moresque style which is more usually associated with dishes and jugs. Many have a plain coloured glaze, either green, yellow or occasionally black but some have designs in brown or green on a white tin glazed background. The tiles are similar to those discovered in 1963 on the floor of Pope Benedict XII's studium in the Palais des Papes. The room was built between 1334 and 1342 and is therefore a little later. The Ch√¢teuneuf tiles are slightly larger and often have animal designs. They were almost certainly manufactured in Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie. The papal accounts record large purchases of tiles in 1317. In 1994, a small archaeological excavation was carried out on the terrace at the foot of the southern fa√ßade of the papal quarters. Altogether fifty tiles were recovered that had been scattered in the modern landfill. At the same time, a survey was conducted in the village to locate tiles held in private collections. A hundred more tiles were identified that had been collected by local people in the 19th and 20th centuries. These new finds enlarged the established iconography and provided more precise information on how the tiles were made. Parish church South side of the church with the main entrance and the bell tower The parish church is now called \\"Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption\\" but over the centuries it has been \\"Notre- Dame\\" (1321), \\"Saint-Th√©odoric\\" (1504), \\"Bienheureuse-Vierge-Marie et Saint- Th√©odoric\\" (1601), \\"Bienheureuse-Vierge-Marie-del'Assomption\\" (1626) and \\"Saint-Th√©odoric\\" (1707). The church probably dates from the end of the 11th century when the village was first fortified. It certainly existed in 1155 when a papal bull issued by Adrian IV confirmed that bishop of Avignon possessed \\"Ch√¢teauneuf Calcernier with its churches\\". Almost nothing survives of the original Romanesque church. It was rectangular in plan with the entrance at the western end. The square tower at the southeast corner which now serves as the bell tower was not part of the early church but formed part of the fortifications of the village. It later housed the municipal archives and in the 16th century supported a clock. The round tower at the northeast corner of the church was also part of the village fortifications but later served as a bell tower. In 1321 Pope John XXII paid for the construction of a side chapel, dedicated to Saint Martin, on the south side of the nave abutting the square tower. A second chapel, dedicated to Saint Anne, was constructed in the 16th century near the Saint Martin chapel. At the end of the 18th century the church was in a bad state of repair and had become too small for the village. Beginning in 1783 the church was extended towards the west and the entrance moved to the south wall. New windows were also created in the south wall of the nave. In 1835 the square tower was converted into the existing bell tower. In the 19th century, before the arrival of phylloxera, the village was very prosperous. Between 1853 and 1859 it paid for a major enlargement of the church in which side aisles were created either side of the nave. The chapels of Saint-Anne and Saint-Martin were demolished to create the southern aisle. To build the northern aisle, the commune bought land and a house on the other side of the Rue Ancienne Ville and displaced the street to the north. In 1981 the church was restored and the plaster on the interior walls was removed. Ch√¢teau de Lhers Drawing of the Ch√¢teau de Lhers by √âtienne Martellange, 1616 The ruined castle of Lhers sits on a limestone outcrop, west of the village of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape on the left bank of the Rh√¥ne. Up to the 18th century there was a village of Lhers associated with this castle. It is mentioned (as Leris) for the first time in a document dated 913 in which Louis the Blind, Count of Provence, gave the castle, one (or two) churches, a port on the Rh√¥ne and the land of the parish, to Fouquier, the bishop of Avignon. In 916, Bishop Fouquier gave the churches, the port and the parish to the churches of Notre-Dame and Saint-√âtienne in Avignon. Neither the castle nor the income from the tolls collected from boats using the Rh√¥ne are mentioned in this document. The plan of the castle is approximately square (25 m x 23 m), with a round tower at the southeast corner and a square tower at the northwest corner. The north side of the outcrop drops away vertically so there was no need for a defensive wall. A deep well is in the northeast corner. A drawing by the Jesuit architect √âtienne Martellange shows the appearance of the castle in 1616. The architecture of the square tower suggests that it was built after the end of the 12th century. Only the ground floor survives. The round tower is later and was probably built in the 14th century. The surviving ruins therefore do not date from the 10th century when the castle is first mentioned in written records. The limestone blocks of the earlier castle were no doubt reused to construct the actual castle. Ch√¢teau de Lhers viewed from the Rh√¥ne The Rh√¥ne was liable to violent floods and the river would change position or bifurcate, creating and destroying islands. The number and the position of the islands varied over the centuries which led to a series of boundary disputes between the communities of Lhers and Ch√¢teauneuf. In the Cassini map of France, dating from the last third of the 18th century, the castle is shown sitting on an island.. At the time of the Revolution, the fief of Lhers included land joined to the right bank near Roquemaure, an island near the left bank separated by a small branch of the river, another island in the middle of the Rh√¥ne on which sat the castle, several gravel banks and a farm on land that was contiguous with Ch√¢teauneuf. The land of the fief was initially considered to be part of the commune of Roquemaure, but in 1820 the castle and the land were transferred to the commune of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. In 1992 the castle was listed as one of the French historical monuments. It is privately owned. Almost nothing survives of the two churches mentioned in the early documents. The church of Sainte-Marie was destroyed during the Revolution. The ruins were visible until the canalization of the Rh√¥ne in the 1970s. The other church, dedicated to the Saints Cosmas and Damian, was probably the earlier of the two. It is mentioned in a papal bull issued in 1138 by Pope Adrian IV that confirmed that the bishop of Avignon possessed the fief of Lhers. The church is mentioned again in another document from 1560. Wine Grapevine with the rounded pebbles which are a feature of many of the vineyards in the commune Although viticulture must have existed in the village well before the arrival of the popes, nothing is known about it. The Introitus et Exitus, the financial record of the Papal Treasury, shows regular purchases of small quantities of wine from the village. At the time, wine was difficult to transport and difficult to conserve so most was drunk locally when less than a year old. Wine production expanded in the 18th century with the rapid development of the wine trade. From the correspondence of the Tulle family who owned the vineyards of the La Nerthe estate, we learn that the 40 hectolitres of wine produced was exported to England, Italy, Germany and all over France. In 1923, the local wine producers led by the lawyer Pierre Le Roy de Boiseaumari√© began a campaign to establish legal protection for the wine from the commune. The delimited area and the method of wine production were awarded legal recognition in 1933. Small changes to the initial regulations were made in 1936 and 1966. The wine classified as Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) is produced from grapes grown in the commune of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape and portions of the four adjoining communes in the Vaucluse. The vineyards cover an area of approximately 3,200 hectares. Of this total 1,659 hectares (52%) lie within the commune of Ch√¢teauneuf, 674 hectares (21.1%) within Courth√©zon, 391 hectares (12.3%) within Orange, 335 hectares (10.5%) within B√©darrides and remaining 129 hectares (4%) in Sorgues. Unlike its northern Rh√¥ne neighbours, Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape AOC permits thirteen different varieties of grape in red wine but the blend must be predominantly grenache. In 2010 there were 320 producers. The total annual production is around 100,000 hectolitres (equivalent to 13 million bottles of 0.75 litre) of which 95% is red. The remainder is white: the production of ros√© is not permitted under this AOC. Population The earliest figure for the population of the village is from the census of 1344, which recorded 508 dwellings or \\"hearths\\". As there were typically 4.5 inhabitants per dwelling, this represented around 2,000 inhabitants, a very large village for the time. The figure was not surpassed until the 20th century. After 1344 there are no further records until 1500, when the population was 1,600. In the 17th century there were several epidemics of bubonic plague and by 1694 the population had dropped to 558. During the 18th century the population of the village doubled, reaching 1,471 in 1866, but when the phylloxera devastated the vineyards the population dropped by a quarter to 1,095 in 1891. The population was 2,179 in 2012. Climate Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape has a humid subtropical climate Cfa in the K√∂ppen climate classification, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around . The driest month is July when the average monthly rainfall is 37 millimeters, just a little too wet for the climate to be classified as Mediterranean (K√∂ppen Csa).

After the band project Rain Tree Crow was disbanded in 1991, the remaining three members decided to create a recording label so they could continue to creatively collaborate as well with other artists, without any pressure from record companies. Also without a principal songwriter, like David Sylvian, they had the freedom to express their ideas and experiment. The band's music style was an experimental, ambient, progressive art rock with influence of electronic music. In their studio and live recordings the JBK also collaborated with Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson, guitarists Rob Dean, Aziz Ibrahim, David Torn, Sugizo, Masami Tsuchiya, saxophonist Theo Travis, and vocalists Zoe Niblett, Robby Aceto among others.

Sealers reduced the population to just a few dozen by the late 19th century, but the species had recovered to 10,000 in number by the late 1990s. Many individuals can be found on Mexico's Guadalupe Island. Description Guadalupe fur seals are sexually dimorphic in size, with the males being much larger than females, although few specimens have been measured. Individuals of both sexes are dark brown or dusky black, with the guard hairs on the back of the neck being yellowish or light tan. Pups are born with a black coat similar to that of adults. The seals are one of the few with visible earflaps, confirming it is not a Phocidaen/true seal. Distribution and habitat Guadalupe fur seals breed along the eastern coast of Guadalupe Island, approximately 200 km west of Baja California. In addition, individuals have been sighted in the southern California Channel Islands, including two males who established territories on San Nicolas Island. Breeding Observations suggest reproductive males are faithful to particular sites over a number of years. Tenure of territorial males lasts from 35‚Äì122 days. Births occur from mid-June through July, with most births taking place in June. Impacts on Guadalupe fur seals The major cause of the Guadalupe fur seal's decline was commercial hunting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The species was exterminated in southern California waters by 1825. Commercial sealing continued in Mexican waters through 1894. Conservation and recovery efforts The species is listed as Threatened by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service under the Endangered Species Act. The principal cause of the decline in Guadalupe fur seals was commercial sealing. The species is now protected from such activity throughout its range, and the magnitude of the threat to the species is considered to be low. The portion of the Guadalupe fur seal's range which is under U.S. jurisdiction is at the limit of the species range. No activities in areas under U.S. jurisdiction are known to be adversely affecting recovery of this species now. Therefore, management activities in the U.S. portion of its range are not likely to contribute substantially to recovery. However, Guadalupe fur seals are protected from federal actions that are likely to jeopardize the species through interagency coordination under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. No other specific actions necessary for the recovery of the species have been identified, and no direct recovery actions are being implemented. References * Belcher, Rebecca L.; and Thomas E.

This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team. Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought-after in championship or all-star games. In Australia, the term \\"best and fairest\\" is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms \\"most valuable player\\" (MVP) or \\"most outstanding player\\" (MOP) are used. In ice hockey in North America, three players of the game, called the \\"three stars\\", are recognised. In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional basketball and baseball, MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey's NHL, for performance in the entire playoffs. Association football In football, the \\"man of the match\\" award typically goes to a player on the winning side. Players who score a hat-trick, or goalkeepers who keep a clean sheet under pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball whether or not they are officially named man of the match. The man of the match is often chosen by a television commentator or a sponsor. However, not all competitions have an official man of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites or newspapers instead. In the Premier League, for example, a player receives a small black and gold trophy for their man of the match performance. Men playing association football. Australian rules football In Australian rules football, the player of the game is often referred to as having been the \\"best on ground\\" (or \\"BOG\\"). Media outlets provide immediate, unofficial recognition that is largely honorary, often on a 5‚Äì4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1 or 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 voting basis. Officially, the AFL recognises the player of the game as being the player awarded the maximum three votes by umpires in the Brownlow Medal count at season's end. Exceptions are made during the season for certain reserved games such as the Western Derby, The ANZAC Day clash, QClash, and Showdown, where medallions are officially rewarded in presentations following the conclusion of the match. On the day of the AFL Grand Final, a player will be awarded the Norm Smith Medal as being the best on ground voted by an independent panel of Australian rules football experts. Cricket In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid 1980s. The man of the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the game. In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from New Zealand was awarded the Men of the Match award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it. In a test match played between 15,16,17,18 January 1999 between South Africa vs West Indies, the whole South African team was awarded man of the match In Test matches, Jacques Kallis holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 23 in 166 matches played. In ODIs, Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of man of the match titles, with 62 awards in 463 matches played. Tendulkar is followed by Sanath Jayasuriya, who, along with Ricky Ponting, also holds the record for the most Man of the Match titles as captain. In the shortest form of the game, T20 Internationals, this record is held by Shahid Afridi, who has won 11 awards in 99 matches. Gaelic games In the Gaelic games of hurling and Gaelic football, the \\"man of the match\\" (, \\"hero of the game\\") is commonly awarded after important games. An unusual example was the 2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, where the award was given to Brian Cody, the Kilkenny manager, rather than to a player. In the women's sports of camogie and ladies' Gaelic football, the term \\"player of the match\\" (, \\"hero of the game\\") is used instead. Ice hockey In North American ice hockey, the three players who perform best in the game, often either those who accumulate the most points or outstanding goaltenders, are usually designated the Three stars of the game: the top-performing player is the first star, and so on. This tradition originated in the 1930s as a promotion for a \\"Three Star\\" brand of gasoline. However, in international play (and outside North America), the three stars concept is rarely used. Instead, other leagues may issue awards to one player who performed best in the game. Rugby football Both codes of rugby, rugby league and rugby union, commonly have man of the match or player of the match awards. In televised or sponsored matches, a commentator or sponsor often decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match. Examples of man of the match awards in professional men's rugby league are the Clive Churchill Medal in the National Rugby League Grand Final, the Karyn Murphy Medal in the NRL Women's Grand Final the Lance Todd Trophy in the Challenge Cup final and the Harry Sunderland Trophy in the Super League Grand Final. College basketball and football In college basketball and college football, the two collegiate sports with the most television coverage in the United States, a top player from each team is usually honoured as \\"players of the game.\\" These athletes usually cannot collect material prizes due to NCAA regulations. Instead, television companies broadcasting the game or corporate sponsors will often make donations to the scholarship funds of each school in the names of the winning players. In college basketball's Final Four events, a Most Outstanding Player award is given, for performance across both the semi-final and championship game. A Most Outstanding Player award is also given for each of the four regionals, based upon performances in the regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and final (Elite Eight). Gridiron football The National Football League names an MVP for two prominent games on its schedule: * A Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award has been awarded at each Super Bowl (the NFL's championship). * The Pro Bowl has had an MVP award throughout its existence. The current Pro Bowl MVP format selects one offensive and one defensive player. From 1956‚Äì1971, two MVP awards were given, one to a skill position and the other to a lineman or linebacker. In 1972, an offensive and defensive MVP were named. From 1973‚Äì2012, a single Pro Bowl MVP was chosen. Individual games typically have an informal player (or players) of the game chosen by the broadcast network covering the game; one prominent example of this phenomenon is the Turkey Leg Award, All-Iron Award and Galloping Gobbler trophies awarded for games held on Thanksgiving. The Canadian Football League awards two MVP awards for its championship game, the Grey Cup. The Grey Cup Most Valuable Player award is open to all players; the Dick Suderman Trophy is limited to players with Canadian citizenship or who were raised in Canada since childhood.

Note that this paper is written in terms of the Shifted Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind T^*_n(x) = T_n(2x-1). It is a generalization of Horner's method for evaluating a linear combination of monomials. It generalizes to more than just Chebyshev polynomials; it applies to any class of functions that can be defined by a three-term recurrence relation. Clenshaw algorithm In full generality, the Clenshaw algorithm computes the weighted sum of a finite series of functions \\\\phi_k(x): :S(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \\\\phi_k(x) where \\\\phi_k,\\\\; k=0, 1, \\\\ldots is a sequence of functions that satisfy the linear recurrence relation :\\\\phi_{k+1}(x) = \\\\alpha_k(x)\\\\,\\\\phi_k(x) + \\\\beta_k(x)\\\\,\\\\phi_{k-1}(x), where the coefficients \\\\alpha_k(x) and \\\\beta_k(x) are known in advance. The algorithm is most useful when \\\\phi_k(x) are functions that are complicated to compute directly, but \\\\alpha_k(x) and \\\\beta_k(x) are particularly simple. In the most common applications, \\\\alpha(x) does not depend on k, and \\\\beta is a constant that depends on neither x nor k. To perform the summation for given series of coefficients a_0, \\\\ldots, a_n, compute the values b_k(x) by the \\"reverse\\" recurrence formula: : \\\\begin{align} b_{n+1}(x) &= b_{n+2}(x) = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_k(x) &= a_k + \\\\alpha_k(x)\\\\,b_{k+1}(x) + \\\\beta_{k+1}(x)\\\\,b_{k+2}(x). \\\\end{align} Note that this computation makes no direct reference to the functions \\\\phi_k(x). After computing b_2(x) and b_1(x), the desired sum can be expressed in terms of them and the simplest functions \\\\phi_0(x) and \\\\phi_1(x): :S(x) = \\\\phi_0(x)\\\\,a_0 + \\\\phi_1(x)\\\\,b_1(x) + \\\\beta_1(x)\\\\,\\\\phi_0(x)\\\\,b_2(x). See Fox and Parker for more information and stability analyses. Examples =Horner as a special case of Clenshaw= A particularly simple case occurs when evaluating a polynomial of the form :S(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k. The functions are simply : \\\\begin{align} \\\\phi_0(x) &= 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_k(x) &= x^k = x\\\\phi_{k-1}(x) \\\\end{align} and are produced by the recurrence coefficients \\\\alpha(x) = x and \\\\beta = 0. In this case, the recurrence formula to compute the sum is :b_k(x) = a_k + x b_{k+1}(x) and, in this case, the sum is simply :S(x) = a_0 + x b_1(x) = b_0(x), which is exactly the usual Horner's method. =Special case for Chebyshev series= Consider a truncated Chebyshev series :p_n(x) = a_0 + a_1T_1(x) + a_2T_2(x) + \\\\cdots + a_nT_n(x). The coefficients in the recursion relation for the Chebyshev polynomials are :\\\\alpha(x) = 2x, \\\\quad \\\\beta = -1, with the initial conditions :T_0(x) = 1, \\\\quad T_1(x) = x. Thus, the recurrence is :b_k(x) = a_k + 2xb_{k+1}(x) - b_{k+2}(x) and the final sum is :p_n(x) = a_0 + xb_1(x) - b_2(x). One way to evaluate this is to continue the recurrence one more step, and compute :b_0(x) = 2a_0 + 2xb_1(x) - b_2(x), (note the doubled a0 coefficient) followed by :p_n(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[b_0(x) - b_2(x)\\\\right]. =Meridian arc length on the ellipsoid= Clenshaw summation is extensively used in geodetic applications. A simple application is summing the trigonometric series to compute the meridian arc distance on the surface of an ellipsoid. These have the form :m(\\\\theta) = C_0\\\\,\\\\theta + C_1\\\\sin \\\\theta + C_2\\\\sin 2\\\\theta + \\\\cdots + C_n\\\\sin n\\\\theta. Leaving off the initial C_0\\\\,\\\\theta term, the remainder is a summation of the appropriate form. There is no leading term because \\\\phi_0(\\\\theta) = \\\\sin 0\\\\theta = \\\\sin 0 = 0. The recurrence relation for \\\\sin k\\\\theta is :\\\\sin (k+1)\\\\theta = 2 \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\sin k\\\\theta - \\\\sin (k-1)\\\\theta, making the coefficients in the recursion relation :\\\\alpha_k(\\\\theta) = 2\\\\cos\\\\theta, \\\\quad \\\\beta_k = -1. and the evaluation of the series is given by : \\\\begin{align} b_{n+1}(\\\\theta) &= b_{n+2}(\\\\theta) = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_k(\\\\theta) &= C_k + 2\\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\,b_{k+1}(\\\\theta) - b_{k+2}(\\\\theta),\\\\quad\\\\mathrm{for\\\\ } n\\\\ge k \\\\ge 1. \\\\end{align} The final step is made particularly simple because \\\\phi_0(\\\\theta) = \\\\sin 0 = 0, so the end of the recurrence is simply b_1(\\\\theta)\\\\sin(\\\\theta); the C_0\\\\,\\\\theta term is added separately: :m(\\\\theta) = C_0\\\\,\\\\theta + b_1(\\\\theta)\\\\sin \\\\theta. Note that the algorithm requires only the evaluation of two trigonometric quantities \\\\cos \\\\theta and \\\\sin \\\\theta. =Difference in meridian arc lengths= Sometimes it necessary to compute the difference of two meridian arcs in a way that maintains high relative accuracy. This is accomplished by using trigonometric identities to write : m(\\\\theta_1)-m(\\\\theta_2) = C_0(\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_2) + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n 2 C_k \\\\sin\\\\bigl({\\\\textstyle\\\\frac12}k(\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_2)\\\\bigr) \\\\cos\\\\bigl({\\\\textstyle\\\\frac12}k(\\\\theta_1+\\\\theta_2)\\\\bigr). Clenshaw summation can be applied in this case provided we simultaneously compute m(\\\\theta_1)+m(\\\\theta_2) and perform a matrix summation, : \\\\mathsf M(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (m(\\\\theta_1) + m(\\\\theta_2)) / 2\\\\\\\\\\\\ (m(\\\\theta_1) - m(\\\\theta_2)) / (\\\\theta_1 - \\\\theta_2) \\\\end{bmatrix} = C_0 \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\mu\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n C_k \\\\mathsf F_k(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2), where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\delta &= {\\\\textstyle\\\\frac12}(\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_2), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu &= {\\\\textstyle\\\\frac12}(\\\\theta_1+\\\\theta_2), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathsf F_k(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos k \\\\delta \\\\sin k \\\\mu\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{\\\\sin k \\\\delta}\\\\delta \\\\cos k \\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} The first element of \\\\mathsf M(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) is the average value of m and the second element is the average slope. \\\\mathsf F_k(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) satisfies the recurrence relation : \\\\mathsf F_{k+1}(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) = \\\\mathsf A(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) \\\\mathsf F_k(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) - \\\\mathsf F_{k-1}(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2), where : \\\\mathsf A(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2) = 2\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\delta \\\\cos \\\\mu & -\\\\delta\\\\sin \\\\delta \\\\sin \\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\- \\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\delta}\\\\delta \\\\sin \\\\mu & \\\\cos \\\\delta \\\\cos \\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix} takes the place of \\\\alpha in the recurrence relation, and \\\\beta=-1.

He became the leader of the Camelots du Roi, the youth organization of the Action Fran√ßaise which took part in many right-wing demonstrations in the years before World War II (1939‚Äì45). After World War II he was imprisoned for collaborationist activity. Life =Early years= Maurice Pujo was born on 26 January 1872. His family was Catholic and royalist. Pujo studied at the lyc√©e in Orl√©ans at the same time as Charles P√©guy. When he was eighteen he won a prize for an essay on Spinoza's moral philosophy. He expected to make a career as a literary critic. He launched the journal La Revue jeune, later renamed L‚ÄôArt et la Vie, which lasted for a few years. He was fluent in German, very interested in German culture and an ardent follower of Richard Wagner. In 1894 he published his first book, Le r√®gne de la gr√¢ce, an essay inspired by the philosophy of the German philosopher Novalis that was praised by the Socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s. He visited Germany as a student in the 1890s. The experience turned him against German influence and made him a French nationalist. =Anti-Dreyfusard= In April 1898, at the height of the Dreyfus affair, the circle of leftist intellectuals to which Pujo belonged became supporters of Alfred Dreyfus. Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois left this group. Late in 1898 Vaugeois, Pujo and a few other nationalists who met at the Caf√© de Flore founded the Comit√© d'action fran√ßaise (Committee of French Action). Three of this group, Louis Dausset, Gabriel Syveton and Vaugeois, opposed to the League for the Rights of Man and Dreyfus, launched a petition that attacked √âmile Zola and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy. In November 1898 their petition gained signatures in the Parisian schools, and was soon circulated throughout political, intellectual and artistic circles in Paris. On 19 December 1898 Pujo published an article that first used the term L‚ÄôAction fran√ßaise (French Action) in the daily paper L‚Äô√âclair in which he declared that the dispute over Dreyfus was damaging France's vital interests, and called for maintenance of the traditions of the homeland. He said the purpose of the Action fran√ßaise should be \\"to remake France, republican and free, into a State as organized at home, as powerful abroad, as it was under the Ancien R√©gime.\\" The decision to create the nationalist anti-Dreyfusard Ligue de la patrie fran√ßaise (League of the French Homeland) was made on 31 December 1898. The Comit√© d'action fran√ßaise was soon merged into the League, which was led by Jules Lema√Ætre. =Action Fran√ßaise= The circle around Vaugeois seen became disillusioned with the League, which lacked any clear doctrine. Vaugeois disagreed with Lema√Ætre's plan to participate in the next legislative elections. The Comit√© d'action fran√ßaise was recreated in April 1899, and the foundational conference of the Action Fran√ßaise movement was held on 20 June 1899 in Paris. In his keynote speech at this meeting Vaugeois declared that the movement stood for \\"anti- Semitic, anti-Masonic, anti-parliamentary and anti-democratic\\" nationalism. Charles Maurras soon joined the Action Fran√ßaise. Maurras thought the Bourbon monarchy should be restored, using violence if needed. Pujo came to agree with Maurras. He wrote later, \\"Under the mortal blows of Charles Maurras, the republicanism of each of us succumbed one by one in this year, 1900, which was the year of the hegira for the Action Francaise.\\" On 16 November 1908 Lucien Moreau and Maurice Pujo created the Camelots du Roi youth movement. Maxime Real del Sarte was a co-founder. In the autumn of 1908 Pujo led the Camelots in a series of nationalist demonstrations ostensibly against a Sorbonne student named Thalamas who had insulted Joan of Arc. He remained director of the Camelots from 1908 to 1939. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Pujo was called up and served on the front. In 1920 Pujo said the Sorbonne was still dangerously infatuated with German culture, and was infiltrated by \\"foreigners, spies, Jews and Bolsheviks.\\" He called for dismissal of faculty members who he thought were pro-German such as Victor Basch, Charles Seignobos and Aulard. He continued to lead demonstrations by the Camelots du Roi into the 1930s, notably the demonstrations about the Stavisky Affair of January and February 1934. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) when the Germans occupied France Pujo stayed with Maurras in Lyon. After L√©on Daudet died in 1942 Pujo was made co-director of the daily Action Fran√ßaise. He was imprisoned by the Gestapo for three weeks in June 1944. In January 1945 Pujo and Maurras were tried for collaboration and Pujo was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released in October 1947. He then became political director of Aspects de la France until his death on 6 September 1955. Pujo has been called \\"a kind of exalted flunky and right-hand man for Maurras.\\" Pujo's son, Pierre Pujo led Action Fran√ßaise until his death on 10 November 2007.

Stellafane (Latin for shrine to the stars) is the name of the clubhouse built by the Springfield Telescope Makers club of Springfield, Vermont in the early 1920s, and has since come to refer to the club's land and buildings on the summit of Breezy Hill. It also refers to the Stellafane Convention, a gathering of amateur telescope makers and amateur astronomers (star party) held every year at that location. The property is a National Historic Landmark. The clubhouse The Springfield Telescope Makers grew out of a class on how to make telescopes that was started by Russell W. Porter in Springfield, Vermont in August 12, 1920. The members of this small group decided to form a club and held their first meeting on December 7, 1923. The Stellafane clubhouse was built in 1924 on a plot belonging to Porter on the summit of Breezy Hill outside of town. The original 20 x clubhouse (with an 11 x ell added in 1926) included a meeting room, a kitchen, a workshop, and bunkrooms on the second floor. The building incorporated a polar Cassegrain telescope, a transit telescope (no longer functional), a solar telescope, and a sundial, on the south wall. The name Stellafane (originally suggested by Porter at the club's January 1924 meeting) comes from the Latin words stella meaning star, and fane meaning shrine which together means \\"Shrine to the Stars\\". Besides the historic Stellafane \\"pink clubhouse,\\" the site includes Porter's uniquely designed Turret Telescope, a f/17 Newtonian reflector that was completed in 1931. This telescope consists of an equatorially rotated concrete dome with the telescope mounted on the outside, with the observer on the inside working in heated comfort. Stellafane is still the location where the Springfield Telescope Makers hold most of their meetings. The clubhouse and the observatory housing Porter's telescope were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989, in recognition for the club's pioneering role in the popularization of astronomy and the amateur construction of telescopes. The convention Stellafane hillside presentation The Stellafane Convention is held every year on the club's land and buildings on the summit of Breezy Hill. It was started by Porter and the Springfield Telescope Makers in 1926, as an occasion for some 20 amateur telescope makers to compare telescopes and exchange ideas. It has since become the longest running astronomical convention in the United States. Thousands of amateur telescope makers from all over the world gather to share their innovations, join in competitions, and enjoy the night sky. The convention is generally held over the weekend of the new moon closest to the height of the Perseid meteor shower (usually early August). =Stellafane East= Although the amateur telescope competition and display is still held on the original site around the clubhouse, most of the convention activities since the mid-1980s have taken place on \\"Stellafane East,\\" an annex to the original land, and a modest walk over Breezy Hill.

Porter, the youngest of five children, was born in 1871 Springfield, Vermont. His parents were Frederick and Caroline Porter. Russell showed an early aptitude for art. He graduated from Vermont Academy in 1891 and went on to study engineering at Norwich University and at the University of Vermont and later studied architecture and art at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. =Arctic exploration= \\"On October 15, Our Luminary dipped below the horizon in a glow of scarlet fire,\\" painting by Russell W. Porter Porter became interested in the arctic when he attended Robert Peary's lectures on Greenland in 1892. He signed up to sail on the ship Miranda as surveyor and artist for Frederick Cook's voyage to Greenland that next year. The voyage ended with the ship colliding with an iceberg and the crew being rescued by Inuit. Porter continued travel to the arctic with Peary and Greenland again in 1896, to Baffin Island in 1897, with the Yukon gold rush in 1898, to Labrador in 1899, and northern Greenland in 1900. Porter was in charge of astronomical observations on the Ziegler Polar Expeditions financed by New York businessman William Ziegler in 1901 and 1903. The second expedition was stranded in the arctic for 3 years when their ship, the Steam Yacht America, was crushed by the ice and sank in Teplitz Bay off Rudolf Island in the Russian arctic. In 1906 Porter again joined Frederick Cook in an expedition to Alaska‚Äôs Denali. Porter‚Äôs party surveyed a region around the mountain (including painting a watercolor of the mountain) while Cook‚Äôs party broke off to climb the mountain. When the parties rendezvoused, Porter was skeptical of Cook's claims that he climbed the mountain.\\"The legacy of the cutaway man.\\" Russell Porter bio at memagazine.org =Port Clyde, Maine years= After his arctic adventures, Porter settled down in Port Clyde, Maine where he tried to start an art colony at Land's End but failed. He built rental cottages, and tried farming. There he married Alice Marshall, the postmistress. Caroline, a daughter, was born in 1912. He also took up astronomy and the hobby of telescope making. He was encouraged by his friend back in Springfield, fellow amateur astronomer and telescope builder James Hartness. In 1913, Hartness sent Porter some telescope building ideas and literature along with two 16-inch-diameter glass blanks. Porter used these to build \\"polar reflector\\" that he incorporated into the roof of a den he added on to his house in a design that allowed him to observe the sky from indoor heated comfort during long Maine winters. Porter wrote an article about his design for the May 1916 issue of Popular Astronomy. Also in 1913, using field stones from walls that crisscrossed Land's End, Porter and one other man built his stone guesthouse in the style of a castle complete with a circular room and square tower, calling it Fieldstone Castle.Willard,Berton.Russell W. Porter Arctic Explorer Artist Telescope Maker. The Bond Wheelwright Company,1976. . In 1915, Porter returned to MIT as a professor of architecture. He worked for the National Bureau of Standards producing prisms and experimenting with the silvering of mirrors during World War I.  Springfield and Stellafane A telescope on display during a 1980s Stellafane Convention, with the \\"pink clubhouse\\" and Porter's Turret Telescope in the background Porter moved back to Springfield, Vermont in 1919 to work at the Jones & Lamson Machine Company, of which James Hartness was president. There he helped Hartness to produce an optical comparator, an instrument for accurately checking the pitch, form, and lead of screw threads. He also designed for this company The Porter Garden Telescope, an innovative ornamental telescope for the garden. =Springfield Telescope Makers= In August 1920, with the help of Hartness, Porter started a class on how to make telescopes. Fifteen people signed up for that class; 14 men, most of whom were workers from Jones & Lamson, and one woman, a school teacher. Porter showed them how to make Newtonian reflectors, teaching all the aspects of mirror making including grinding, polishing, and testing their own mirrors, and designing and constructing telescope mounts. The members of this small group decided to form an astronomical club and December 7, 1923 was the first meeting of the Springfield Telescope Makers. Soon after, they built a clubhouse on a plot belonging to Porter on Breezy Hill outside of town. They called the clubhouse Stellafane, Latin for shrine to the stars. The Springfield Telescope Makers invited other groups of stargazers to their clubhouse in 1926, to compare telescopes and exchange ideas. From this small meeting was born the annual event called ‚ÄúStellafane‚Äù, an event that goes on to this day. In 1925 Albert G. Ingalls featured Porter and the Springfield Telescope Makers in two articles he wrote for Scientific American magazine.A Brief History of Stellafane by Bert Willard The articles contained a great deal of material and illustrations contributed by Porter. There was so much public interest, a regular column, \\"The Back Yard Astronomer\\" (later to become The Amateur Scientist column) was started by Ingalls with Porter being a contributing editor. Much of the information from the articles published by Ingalls and Scientific American in the books Amateur Telescope Making (Vols. 1‚Äì3), a work that has been referred to as \\"the bible of telescope making\\", helped to create lasting public interest in observational astronomy. Working on the Hale Telescope The 200 inch Hale telescope at Mount Palomar In 1927, at Ingalls suggestion, George Ellery Hale recruited Porter to work on the design of what was then to be the largest telescope on earth, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. Porter moved to Pasadena in December 1928 to work as an associate in optics and instrument design. During the conceptual development of the telescope Porter produced extremely detailed cutaway drawings that were noted for their precision and beauty.Masters of Cutaway Illustration Russell W. Porter (1871‚Äì1949) Cutaway Drawings, by Kevin Hulsey Porter's designs were vital to success of the large telescope, which was completed in 1948. Russell W. Porter died in 1949 of a heart attack at the age of 77. The crater Porter on the Moon and the crater Porter on Mars are named in his honor.

They are found only on the Pacific Coast of South America, more specifically on the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands and the Desventuradas Islands. There is still much that is unknown about this species. Scientists still do not know the average life span of this species, or the diet and behavior of males apart from the breeding season. Description The Juan Fernandez fur seal is part of the group of eared seals. Fur seals in general have thick insulating fur that protects the skin from cold water, they have small ear flaps on the side of their head, and they hold their weight on their front flippers which are also used for land locomotion. Fur seals are different from true seals because they have the external ear flaps, but also true seals use their chest for support and movement, fur seals walk on their front flippers. The Juan Fernandez fur seal is the second smallest fur seal, second only to the Gal√°pagos fur seal. Their bodies are short and robust with brown pelage. Both the fore flippers and the hind flippers are relatively short, and the hind flippers have fleshy tips on the digits. Females are lighter brown and average 100 pounds and 4'6\\" long. Males are significantly larger and average 300 pounds and 6'6\\" in length. Males have thicker necks than females and have generally darker brown pelage. Male seals have golden tipped thick guard hairs on the back of the head, neck, and shoulders. This seal species has a trait called sexual dimorphism, meaning the males look much different from the females after reaching sexual maturity. History The Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal was discovered, and named, by Juan Fern√°ndez in the mid 1500s. Once the seal was discovered the population was decimated by over hunting for the fur trade. It was believed that the Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal was extinct until a small group of 200 was found on the Juan Fern√°ndez islands in the 1960s. Now it is estimated that over 12,000 individuals exist today. In 1864 the naturalist Rodolfo Philippi, working at the Chilean National Museum of Natural History sent the fur and skeleton of a specimen to Wilhelm Peters in Berlin's Museum f√ºr Naturkunde for taxonomic classification. Classification in Chile was not possible at the time as specimens for comparison and relevant literature on the topic was not available in the country. Also, early naturalists in Chile had also to deal with a wide range of topics while those in Europe were more specialized. The resulting classification by Peters became the subject of a long-running cientific controversy. Hermann Burmeister compared drawings and the written description of the species with specimens at the La Plata Museum and concluded in 1866 that it was not a new species but a Phoca porcina that was described by the Jesuit Juan Ignacio Molina many years ago. In the early 1870s John Edward Gray, who had recently arrived specimens of similar species from Australia and New Zealand to his disposal, questioned whether Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal was a species by its own. In 1879 he wrote again on the subject claiming that O. philippi was indeed the same as Otaria ursina described by Claudio Gay. In 1888 and 1889 Phillipi published articles where he harshly criticized both Burmeisters alternative classification and his alleged errors, suggesting a poor knowledge of geography and of the sources he cited. Behavior This particular seal lives a solitary life. Seals forage out at sea and haul out on rocky shores to rest. Females seem to be fairly particular about where she rests during the day and prefer tide pools and rocky caves. The resting areas that females prefer often become areas of male competition for breeding rights. Although females will typically rest in close regions, they are sure to be a few feet away from each other and never touch one another. Reproduction Breeding is a territorial process with the Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal, males will aggressively fight for access to female resting sites. This seal is polygynous, meaning that one male breeds with multiple females. Pups are born between November and December and are weaned off the mother's milk at 10 months of age. Mothers stay with the pups for about a week and then they leave to mate again and forage. Pups are born with soft black fur that fades to light brown within the first few years. Diet Not much is known about the diet of Juan Fern√°ndez fur seals. Scientists have only observed the diet of lactating females that are caring for pups. What they have observed is that females forage out at sea sometimes as far as 300 miles off shore and will dive to depths of 30 to 300 feet to find lanternfish and squid. Typically lactating females will dive and forage at night when prey swims to shallow waters and become more accessible. Sometimes they will stay out at sea for up to 25 days, then return to shore and stay with the pups for 5 days. During the period that the mothers are foraging the pup goes without milk for several days, sometimes weeks. To combat this, the mother's milk is high in fat and nutrients that the pup uses for energy while the mother is away. However, during this time the pups' immune systems are not as highly functioning as adults and can be prone to infection from intestinal parasites that leads to fatal infections. In the early 90s there were 60 pups discovered dead from hookworm infections, and also the presence of heavy metal ions were found in their systems. Such loss decimated the population and they are still recovering now.

Typically, the backed up data includes the necessary operating system, applications and data components to rebuild or restore the backed up system to an entirely separate piece of hardware. In some configurations, the hardware receiving the restore needs to have an identical configuration to the hardware that was the source of the backup, although virtualization techniques and careful planning can enable a bare-metal restore to a hardware configuration different from the original. Disk imaging applications enable bare-metal restores by storing copies (images) of the entire contents of hard disks to networked or other external storage, and then writing those images to other physical disks. The disk image application itself can include an entire operating system, bootable from a live CD or network file server, which contains all the required application code to create and restore the disk images. Examples of software used for bare-metal recovery The \`dd\` utility on a Linux boot CD can be used to copy file systems between disk images and disk partitions to effect a bare-metal backup and recovery. These disk images can then be used as input to a new partition of the same type but equal or larger size, or alternatively a variety of virtualization technologies as they often represent a more accessible but less efficient representation of the data on the original partition. The IBM VM/370 operating system provides a command by the name of \\"ddr,\\" for disk dump and restore. It is a bit by bit backup of a hard drive to a specified media, typically tape, but many choices exist. Microsoft introduced a new backup utility (Wbadmin) into Windows Server 2008 family of operating system in 2008 which has built-in support for bare-metal recovery. Users of this software can also recover their system to a Hyper-V virtual machine.

Further complicating Leo's life is Julius (Peter Stormare) who has asked Leo to kill his wife, Gloria. Only when it comes time to be paid, Julius, who has Leo committing the murder on tape, confesses he does not have a wife; he paid a woman to pretend to be his wife. Julius wants 500,000 in pounds, otherwise he will release the tape to the authorities. Then Moose shows up and He is looking for a woman who is the love of his life. Her name is Gloria. He asks if Leo could help him find her and Leo reluctantly agrees. Finally, there's Troy, a loan shark. Leo owes him a lot of money, but he has lost it all at the track. Troy is getting increasingly impatient and violent as he does not like to be kept waiting on his money. Evidence is piling up that Lily is working a con on Leo. With all these problems, it does not look as if Leo will survive the week. Bruno's in trouble with the Inland Revenue, so his accountant, Julius, comes up with an idea to con Lily by turning all of Bruno's shipping company over to her, while Bruno pockets a $20 million. Only the problem is that Leo has got to Julius first and worked out a con of his own. Together Julius and Leo staged Gloria's murder. Leo goes to meet Julius with the blackmail money. Bruno has men with guns waiting, but Moose shows up to even out the fight. A bloodbath ensues and Julius, the only survivor, tells the tale to Bruno. Only Leo is not dead, and he leaves a recording that Lily finds and then shows to Bruno. Leo figured out that Lily was conning him, and he confesses that he stole Bruno's money. An enraged Lily and Bruno go to find Julius and catch him as he is splitting town. But then Leo shows up wanting to kill Bruno. Bruno says that Leo cannot possibly kill him because he would have to kill his wife also. Reluctantly Leo agrees, and shoots Lily. Then he convinces Julius that the only way they can be partners is if he kills Bruno, so that they have a murder each on their hands. Julius does not mean to, but the gun goes off and Bruno is dead. During their getaway, Julius begins to feel odd. Leo confesses that he slipped a sedative into Julius' drink. He leaves a drugged Julius by the side of the road and with the con finished he makes his way to the train station where he meets up with Lily.

Bokini, who held the chiefly title of Tui Tavua, succeeded Ratu Epeli Ganilau as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs on 21 July 2004, and was re-elected to this post for a full three-year term on 27 July 2005. A formal gathering of mostly traditional chiefs chosen by the country's 14 provincial councils, along with some appointees of the national government and the Council of Rotuma, the Great Council of Chiefs functioned as an electoral college to select Fiji's President, along with 14 of the 32 members of the Senate. Informally, the Council advised the Fijian government on every aspect of political life. Although not mandated by the Constitution, the chairman's role was therefore a very influential one. During late April 2007, all members of G.C.C were suspended by the Interim Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama. The suspension included the chairman, Ovini Bokini and all other members of G.C.C after the President's nomination for the Vice-President position was rejected by some G.C.C members.  Unusual appointment  Bokini was chosen to fill this position after his predecessor, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, had become embroiled in political controversy, calling for the resignation of the then-Vice-President, Jope Seniloli (who has since been convicted of treason for his role in the coup d'√©tat that deposed the elected government in 2000), and proposing the revival of the country's former ruling political party, the Alliance Party, as a multi-racial party, hinting that he would play a role in it. Many politicians feared that Ganilau was compromising the neutrality of the Council, and it is thought that government pressure played a role in the decision of the Cakaudrove Provincial Council to replace him as their representative with someone less controversial. Without membership of the Council, Ganilau was ineligible to serve as its chairman. The sentencing of Vice-President Seniloli to four years' imprisonment for treason on 6 August 2004 created fears of a possible power vacuum should anything happen to the ailing 83-year-old President, Josefa Iloilo. Constitutional experts, however, said that as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, Bokini could choose to assume the role of Vice-President in an interim capacity. Seniloli resigned on 29 November, paving the way for President Iloilo to nominate, and the Great Council to approve, Joni Madraiwiwi as the new Vice-President on 15 December.  Position on the Unity Bill  On 18 May 2005, Bokini complained that the Great Council of Chiefs had not been consulted, or even officially informed, about the government's controversial legislation to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission with the power, subject to presidential approval, to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup. Attempts by the Great Council to obtain a copy of the bill for study and discussion had come to nothing, he said. On 30 May, in a speech to mark Ratu Sukuna Day in honour of Fiji's first modern statesman, Lala Sukuna, he cautioned that reconciliation was not something that could be forced or one-sided. \\"It must be allowed to grow through a shared understanding of what we all want and where we are all heading,\\" he said. Only with good leadership and the support and goodwill of other ethnic groups could indigenous Fijians seriously negotiate about what to give and what to take ‚Äì a process that would take time and patience. He proposed the Fijian language as a common bond to unite Fiji's diverse ethnic communities, saying that especially in rural areas, Fijian was widely used as a common language. Later, however, he came out strongly in favour of the Unity Bill.  2006 coup d'√©tat  Bokini condemned the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat, which overthrew the government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Bokini said that the Great Council of Chiefs would refuse to recognise the interim government appointed by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. (source) He angrily denounced his predecessor, Epeli Ganilau, who claimed to sympathise with the motives though not the method of the coup, for claiming to be mediating between the Great Council of Chiefs and the Military. \\"I never made a request to meet the commander. Whoever said that is lying. I don't intend to see the commander. He has to make a request to me if he wants to meet me,\\" Bokini declared. On 7 December 300 villagers blocked the entrance to Tavualevu Village, in response to a rumour that the military was coming to arrest Bokini, a rumour the army quickly denied.  Background and career  Bokini hailed from the village of Tavualevu and held the chiefly title of Tui Tavua, as Paramount Chief of the Tavua District of Ba Province. He was the son of Ratu Etuate Bokini and Sereima Lalavanua. He held various positions of employment in the Fiji Sugar Corporation before joining Fiji's House of Representatives. He was a member of the House of Representatives in the 1990s, and also served in the Cabinet, holding a variety of portfolios. In addition to chairing the Great Council of Chiefs, he has also served as Chairman of the Ba Provincial Council. Bokini was married to Tavo Bokini, with whom he had four children. He died on 15 January 2009 at his home in Tavua.Ratu Ovini Bokini Passes Away References Category:Fijian chiefs Category:Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei politicians Category:I-Taukei Fijian members of the House of Representatives (Fiji) Category:1944 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Politicians from Tavua, Fiji ","title":"Ovini Bokini"},{"id":"906751","text":"Jombang Mosque, birthplace of the Nahdlatul Ulama Nahdlatul Ulama (literally translated to Revival of the Ulama, abbreviated as NU) is a traditionalist Sunni Islam movement in Indonesia following the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. NU was established on January 31, 1926 in Surabaya as a response to the rise of Wahabism in Saudi Arabia and Islamic modernism in Indonesia. The NU is the largest independent Islamic organization in the world with membership estimates ranging from 40 million (2013) to over 90 million (2019). NU also is a charitable body funding schools and hospitals as well as organizing communities to help alleviate poverty. Some leaders of Nahdlatul Ulama are ardent advocates of Islam Nusantara, a distinctive brand of Islam that has undergone interaction, contextualization, indigenization, interpretation and vernacularization according to socio-cultural conditions in Indonesia. Islam Nusantara promotes moderation, compassion, anti-radicalism, inclusiveness and tolerance. However, other NU members, leaders, and religious scholars have rejected Islam Nusantara in favor of a more conservative approach. Ideology Nahdlatul Ulama follows the ideology of Ahl as-Sunna Wa al-Jama'ah, taking the middle path between extreme aqli (rationalist) and extreme naqli (scripturalist) tendencies. The organization identifies the Quran, the Sunnah, and the ability of the mind coupled with empirical reality as the sources of its thought. It attributes this approach to earlier thinkers, such as Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari and Abu Mansur Al-Maturidi in the field of theology. In the field of jurisprudence, it recognizes the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools of law, but relies in practice on Shafi'i teachings. In matters of Sufism, NU follows the path of Al-Ghazali and Junaid al-Baghdadi.http://www.nu.or.id/a,public-m,static-s,detail-lang,en- ids,1-id,7-t,religious+ideology-.phpx It has been described by western media as a progressive, liberal and pluralistic Islamic movement, but is a diverse organization with large conservative factions as well. History =Origin= NU was established in 1926 as an organization for orthodox Muslims opposed to the modernist policies of the Muhammadiyah organization, which rejected pre-Islamic Javanese traditions. The organization was established after The Committee of Hijaz had fulfilled its duty and about to be dissolved. The organization was established by Hasyim Asy'ari, the head of an Islamic religious school in East Java. The organization expanded, but the base of its support remained in East Java. By 1928, the NU was using the Javanese language in its sermons, alongside Arabic. In 1937, despite poor relations between the NU and Muhammidayah, the two organizations established the Supreme Islamic Council of Indonesia () as a discussion forum. They were joined by most of the other Islamic organizations in existence at the time. In 1942, the Japanese occupied Indonesia and in September a conference of Islamic leaders was held in Jakarta. The Japanese wanted to replace the MIAI, but the conference not only decided to maintain the organization, but also elected political figures belonging to the PSII to the leadership, rather than members of the non-political NU or Muhammadiyah as the occupiers had wanted. Just over a year later, the MIAI was dissolved and replaced by the Japanese-sponsored Masyumi (Consultative Council of Indonesian Muslims). Hasjim Asjari was the notional chairman, but in practice the new organization was led by his son, Wahid Hasyim. Other NU and Muhammadiyah figures held leadership positions. In 1945, Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence. During the Indonesian war of independence, the NU declared that the fight against the Dutch colonial forces was a holy war, obligatory for all Muslims. Among the guerrilla groups fighting for independence were Hizbullah and Sabillilah, which were led by the NU. =Transformation into Islamic political party= Following the recognition of Indonesian independence, a new party called Masyumi was established with the NU as a component of it. The NU leadership at the time had no political skills, and was awarded few influential cabinet positions, with the exception of chairman Wahid Hasyim, who was appointed religious affairs minister. The NU was unhappy with its lack of influence within Masyumi, especially after a decision at the 1949 party conference changed the party's religious council, on which the NU held several positions, into a powerless advisory body. Two years later, a dispute over the organization of the Haj pilgrimage led to Prime Minister Natsir's opposition to the reappointment of Hasyim as religious affairs minister in the next cabinet. In the ensuing cabinet crisis, the NU made a series of demands, including the retention of Hasyim, and threatened to leave Masyumi. On 5 April 1952, a few days after the announcement of a new cabinet without Hasyim, the NU decided in principle to leave Masyumi. Three months later it withdrew all its members from Masyumi councils, and on 30 August it established the Indonesian League of Muslims, comprising the NU, PSSI and a number of smaller organizations. It was chaired by Hasyim. During the liberal democracy era (1950‚Äì1957), NU members served in a number of cabinet posts. In the first Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, the NU held three seats, with Zainul Arifin appointed second deputy prime minister. However, following the fall of this cabinet, some NU members were opposed to the NU joining the new cabinet, to be formed by Burhanuddin Harahap Cabinet, believing that if he was unable to form a cabinet, the NU would be invited to try. It was finally pressured into participating, and was awarded the interior and religious affairs portfolios in the cabinet, which was sworn in on 12 August 1955. On 29 September 1955, Indonesia held its first parliamentary elections. The NU came in third, with almost 7 million votes, 18.4% of the total, behind the Indonesian National Party and Masyumi. It was awarded 45 seats in the People's Representative Council, up from only eight before the election. The NU was the largest party in its East Java base, and 85.6% of its vote came from Java. There was a clear division between Masyumi, representing outer-island, urban voters and the NU, representing the rural Javanese constituency. Three months later, elections were held for the Constitutional Assembly, which was tasked with drawing up a permanent constitution. The results were very similar, with the NU winning 91 of the 114 seats. In the 1950s, the NU still wanted to see Indonesia become an Islamic state, and expressed its disapproval of a 1953 presidential speech in which Sukarno rejected this. Three years later, it also argued against Sukarno's \\"conception\\" that would eventually lead to the establishment of guided democracy, as this would mean PKI members sitting in the cabinet. On 2 March 1957, the Permesta rebellion broke out. Among its demands was the restoration of Mohammad Hatta to the vice-presidency. The NU supported these calls. Meanwhile, in the Constitutional Assembly, the NU joined Masyumi, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII), the Islamic Education Movement (Perti) and other parties to form the Islamic Block, which wanted Indonesian to become an Islamic state. The block made up 44.8% of total seats. However, with none of the blocks able to command a majority and push through the constitution it wanted, the assembly failed to agree and was dissolved by Sukarno in a decree on 5 July 1959 that also restored the original 1945 Constitution, which declared the state to be based on the Pancasila philosophy, not Islam. In 1960, President Sukarno banned Masyumi for alleged involvement in the Permesta rebellion. However, the fundamentalist and compradore leadership of NU saw the pro-poor Communist Party of Indonesia, which was close to Sukarno, as an obstacle to its ambitions, and competed with it to win support from the poor. Five years later, the coup attempt by the 30 September Movement took place. In 1965, the group took sides with the General Suharto-led army and was heavily involved in the mass killings of Indonesian communists. However, the NU later began to oppose Suharto's regime. In 1984, Abdurrahman Wahid, the grandson of NU founder Hasyim Asy'ari, inherited the leadership from his father, and was later elected President of Indonesia in 1999. He formally apologized for NU's involvement in the events of 1965. He also stated that \\"Nadhatul Ulama (NU) is like Shiite minus Imamah; similarly Shiite is NU plus Imamah.\\" There have been many similarities between the two, such as the position and role of kyai. The main contrast between them is that in NU, the concept is visible in the form of accepted culture, while in Shia, it takes the form of theology. Following the deposing of Sukarno, the New Order regime under President Suharto held elections in 1971. Despite manipulation of the NU by the government, which caused it to lose much credibility, the NU managed to maintain its 18% share of the vote from the 1955 poll. However, in 1973, it was obliged to \\"fuse\\" into the new United Development Party (). The PPP came second, after the government sponsored Golkar organization in the elections of 1977 and 1982, but in 1984, the new NU chairman Abdurrahman Wahid (also known as Gus Dur), the son of Wahid Haschim, withdrew the NU from the PPP because of dissatisfaction with the NU's lack of influence. As a result, in the 1987 election, the PPP vote collapsed from 28% in 1982 to only 16%. From then on, it was expected that the NU would concentrate on religious and social activities. =Outside politics= In 1984, the New Order government announced that all organizations would have to accept state ideology Pancasila as their basis. Once again the NU was accommodating, with Gus Dur calling Pancasila a \\"noble compromise\\" for Muslims. Five years later. Gus Dur was reelected for a second five-year term as chairman, a position he held until being elected president in 1999. In 1990, the NU worked with Bank Summa to establish a system of rural banks. Suharto did not approve of the NU straying beyond purely religious activities, and the fact the bank was owned by a Christian ethnic-Chinese family led to controversy. The bank was eventually shut down two years later because of financial mismanagement. Gus Dur also incurred the disapproval of the regime by holding a mass rally at a Jakarta stadium three months before the 1992 legislative elections, ostensibly to express support for Pancasila. This resulted in Gus Dur being invited to meet Lt. Col. Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law at Jakarta Military Headquarters. At the meeting, Gus Dur was warned to avoid unacceptable political conduct, and told that if he insisted in involving himself in politics, rather than confining himself to religious matters, he should express support for a further presidential term for Suharto. In response, Gus Dur threatened to leave the NU. This resulted in the regime backing down, as it could not risk bringing Gus Dur down. =Post-New Order era= During the fall of Suharto, Nahdlatul Ulama members and Islamic clerics were killed by rioters in Banyuwangi in East Java when a witchhunt against alleged sorcerers spiralled out of control. Following the fall of Suharto and his replacement by Vice-president B. J. Habibie, in July 1998 Gus Dur announced the establishment of the National Awakening Party (). On 10 November, Gus Dur met with other pro-reform figures Amien Rais, Megawati Sukarnoputri and Sultan Hamengkubuwono. The so-called Ciganjur Four, named after the location of Gus Dur's house, issued a declaration calling the Habibie administration \\"transitional\\" and calling for elections to be brought forward and for the Indonesian Military to end its political role In Indonesia's first free elections since 1955, held on 7 June 1999, the PKB won 13 percent of the vote. In the ensuing session of the People's Consultative Assembly, Gus Dur was elected President of Indonesia, defeating Megawati by 373 votes to 313. However, he was deposed just two years later. The PKB subsequently split into two warring factions, one led by Gus Dur's daughter, Yenny Wahid. An attempt in 2008 by Gus Dur to involve President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in resolving the dispute failed, and the PKB vote in the 2009 elections was half that of the previous vote in 2004. At its 2010 conference, held in Makassar, the NU decided not to discuss the split, and passed a resolution banning officials from holding political posts, seen as a commitment to avoiding future political involvement. After the conference, concerns about the longer term role of the NU continued to attract comment in the national media. During 2011, for example, there was continuing discussion about the national role that the NU should play and about the close political links between the NU and the National Awakening Party (PKB). Comments by Gus Dur's daughter, Yenny Wahid, for example, reflected these concerns when she said that the NU was fragmenting and \\"sliding into irrelevance\\".'Nation's largest Muslim group laments 'waning influence' ', The Jakarta Post, 20 June 2011 Aims The NU exists to spread Islamic teaching. As well as preaching, it undertakes educational activities through its network of 6,830 Islamic boarding schools, or pesantren. It also owns 44 universities, and is involved in economic and agricultural studies, and social activities including family planning.NU Website Its goal is \\"to spread messages about a tolerant Islam in their respective countries to curb radicalism, extremism and terrorism,\\" which, it claims, \\"often spring from a misinterpretation of Islamic teachings.\\" In December 2014, NU have launched a global campaign against extremism and jihadism. Building a prevention center in Indonesia to train Arabic-speaking students, alongside NU theologians, to combat jihadist rhetoric. And it has created a joint program with the University of Vienna called VORTEX (Vienna Observatory for Applied Research on Radicalism and Extremism). The project is funded by the Ministry of Internal Security. It also created an American nonprofit organization called Bayt ar-Rahmah in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. On the other hand, Nahdlatul Ulama had given a fatwa in favour of female genital mutilation (FGM). In 2019, NU called for the abolishment of the term \\"kafir\\" to describe non-muslims. Leaders The highest body in the NU is Syuriah (Supreme Council). Under this is Tanfidziyah (Executive Council). Mustasyar (Advisory Council) provides input to both. At the 2010 NU Conference, Sahal Mahfudz was elected chairman of the Executive Council, and thus serves as executive chief. At the same conference, Sahal Mahfudz was elected chair of the Supreme Council for the 2010-2015 period. Under the Executive Council, there are provincial level Regional Boards, as well as autonomous bodies, institutes and committees, with the structure extending down to Sub Branch Representative Council Boards in villages.

The magazine has consistently published the work of Israeli and Palestinian left-wing intellectuals, but also included book and music reviews, personal essays, and poetry. In 2006 and 2011, the magazine was awarded the Independent Press Award for Best Spiritual Coverage by Utne Reader for its analysis of the inability of many progressives to understand people's yearning for faith, and the American fundamentalists' political influence on the international conflict among religious zealots. The magazine was founded in 1986 by Michael Lerner and his then-wife Nan Fink Gefen. Since 2012, its publisher is Duke University Press. Beyt Tikkun Synagogue, led by Rabbi Michael Lerner, is loosely affiliated with Tikkun magazine. It describes itself as a \\"hallachic community bound by Jewish law\\". Origin and meaning of the name The magazine's title comes from mystical Hebrew concept tikkun olam (; \\"healing or restoring the world\\"), emphasizing both humanity's and God's co-responsibility \\"to heal, repair and transform the world\\". In her book, If I Am Not For Myself: The Liberal Betrayal of the Jews, Ruth Wisse argues that Tikkun is one of a group of left-of-center Jewish organizations and publications founded in the 1980s without explaining why a new, Jewish was needed to cover issues already covered by such existing publications as Dissent. Wisse argues that the actual motivation was a need felt by highly educated Jews to counter rising antisemitism on the left by means of \\"public avowals of kindliness and liberalism.\\" Publisher Initially, Nan Fink Gefen, at the time married to Lerner, devoted financial resources and served as a hands-on publisher until she left as their marriage ended in 1991. In 1997 a fellow 1960s-activist Danny Goldberg, a major music industry figure heavily involved in the ACLU, became co-publisher with his father, Victor. During these years, prominent journalists such as Jack Newfield interviewed national and international leaders such as Mario Cuomo and Haiti's embattled President Aristide to bring more credibility to the growing influence of the magazine. From 2002 through 2011, Lerner's sister, Trish Vradenburg, and her husband served as co- publishers. Editorial policy Founded in 1986, the magazine's editorial policy was shaped by Nan Fink Gefen, Michael Lerner, and Peter Gabel. According to the founding editorial statement, political concerns of the 1960s civil rights, anti-war, and feminist movements and psychological studies of workers in the 1970s and 1980s were their most direct influences. Among authors who contributed to the magazine's interfaith character were the historian Christopher Lasch, philosopher Cornel West, and Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School. Obliquely confronting more conservative American Jewish community's Commentary Magazine, which caused some members of the Editorial Board, including Elie Wiesel, to resign, the magazine introduced itself with prominent ads placed in leading intellectual papers and journals declaring a new voice for the Jewish Left. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel's legacy of \\"prophetic\\" Jewish activism has been honored and analyzed from the first issue onward. In every issue, it is stated that its articles \\"do not necessarily reflect Tikkun's position on any issue\\", and its editor, Rabbi Michael Lerner, has written that he \\"often consciously seeks to print articles with which he disagrees\\". Network of Spiritual Progressives In 2001 the magazine's interfaith activist community's website, the Network of Spiritual Progressives, initially named differently, was established by founders that include Sister Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun, and Cornel West, a Princeton University professor of religion, in order to engage readers in broader activism and broaden the magazine's appeal to non-Jewish readers. Challenging the anti-religious and anti-spiritual biases within liberal culture and \\"replacing world domination with generosity\\" are among the ideas that are supported by the community. Controversy =Accusations of Anti- Semitism= In 2005 Manfred Gerstenfeld cited an article published by Tikkun -- Joel Kovel‚Äôs \\"On Left Anti-Semitism and the Special Status of Israel\\" (May/June 2003) -- as one of two examples of \\"essays of Jewish authors using anti-Semitic arguments\\". In his article, Kovel described Israel as a racist state that \\"automatically generates crimes against humanity and lacks the internal means of correcting them\\", adding that such a state \\"cannot have that legitimacy which gives it the right to exist\\". In a 2006 column, Alan Dershowitz wrote that \\"Tikkun is quickly becoming the most virulently anti- Israel screed ever published under Jewish auspices\\" and that \\"support for Tikkun is support for the enemies of Israel\\". Dershowitz and his books have been the targets of criticism in the pages of Tikkun (for example: May/June 1997, September/October 1997, November/December 1997, January/February 1999). =Improprieties regarding Letters to the editor= In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of publishing pseudonymous letters to the editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory (\\"Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say.\\"), a few were critical (\\"Have you gone off your rocker?\\"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.

It stands on a crag approximately above sea level\\"STAHLECK Burg (Stadt Bacharach)\\", Elmar Rettinger, Historisches Ortslexikon Rheinland-Pfalz Volume 2 Ehemaliger Kreis St. Goar, Institut f√ºr Geschichtliche Landeskunde an der Universit√§t Mainz 37, Stuttgart: Steiner, 1996, (pdf) on the left bank of the river at the mouth of the Steeg valley, approximately south of Koblenz, and offers a commanding view of the Lorelei valley. Its name means \\"impregnable castle on a crag\\", from the Middle High German words stahel (steel) and ecke (here: crag). It has a water- filled partial moat, a rarity in Germany. Built on the orders of the Archbishop of Cologne, it was destroyed in the late 17th century but rebuilt in the 20th and is now a hostel. History =Beginnings= From about 1000 AD, Bacharach is presumed to have been a possession of the Archbishops of Cologne. They had the castle built, perhaps as a southern outpost to guard the far-flung archbishopric; their Vogt resided there. It is uncertain when the present castle was built to replace an earlier fortification; perhaps around 1135.Robert R. Taylor, The Castles of the Rhine: Recreating the Middle Ages in Modern Germany, Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University, 1998, , p. 283. It was the first large castle north of Bingen and R√ºdesheim. A \\"Gozwin von Stalecke\\" is first mentioned in charters in 1120/21. This was Goswin von Falkenburg, who is also referred to in 1135 by the Latin translation \\"Cozwinus de Staelechae\\" and was the first attested holder of the castle in fief. He was a member of a Main-Frankish family and had come into possession of the castle through marriage to Luitgard von Hengebach, the widow of Heinrich I of Katzenelnbogen, who died in 1102. From then on he called himself Goswin von Stahleck. =Seat of the Counts Palatine by Rhine= In 1125, Goswin's son Hermann married Gertrud of Swabia, sister of King Conrad III of Germany. After receiving Stahleck Castle in fief from his brother in law in 1140, in 1140 he was additionally granted the County of Palatinate by Rhine. This made him one of the greatest lords of the Holy Roman EmpireHeinrich St√ºber, Burg Stahleck √ºber Bacharach: von der Stauferburg zur Jugendherberge, Bacharach: Verein f√ºr die Geschichte der Stadt Bacharach und der Viert√§ler, 2004, ; excerpts online and the Four Valley Region, which consisted of the settlements of Bacharach, Steeg (now part of Bacharach), Diebach and Manubach plus the castles of Stahleck, F√ºrstenberg and Stahlberg, and made Stahleck the centre of power of the heart of what later became the Rhineland territory of the Counts Palatine. They developed Bacharach into a trading town, among other things for the wine trade, and the castle was thus used to enforce payment of duties. When he went on the Second Crusade, Conrad made Hermann his regent. After Hermann's death in 1156, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa bestowed the title of Count Palatine on his half-brother Conrad of Hohenstaufen. After the death of his remaining son in 1189, Conrad's only heir was his daughter Agnes. So that the castle and the title could remain in the family, that year King Henry VI commuted the fief from a personal to a hereditary one. In the future this led to repeated conflicts between the Counts Palatine and the See of Cologne, since Stahleck was a possession of the Electoral Archbishop and not the king's to modify. It was her father's wish for Agnes to marry King Philip II of France, but instead when Conrad was away from the castle in January or February 1194, she secretly married Henry the Elder of Brunswick, son of his enemy the Welf Duke Henry the Lion, to whom she had previously been engaged;Walther Ottendorff-Simrock, tr. Barry Jones, Castles on the Rhine: 39 Photographs with an Introduction, Bonn: Stolfuss, 1978 (?), , p. 52.According to Monk Gibbon, The Rhine and its Castles, London: Putnam, 1957, OCLC 1327080, p. 125, the marriage actually took place at the Pfalz. the marriage, performed by Johann I, Archbishop of Triers,Bernd Brinken, Die Politik Konrads von Staufen in der Tradition der Rheinischen Pfalzgrafschaft: der Widerstand gegen die Verdr√§ngung der Pfalzgrafschaft aus dem Rheinland in der 2.

However, in 1212 he renounced the title and the rights associated with it in favour of his son Henry the Younger. When the latter died young and childless in 1214, his younger sister Agnes inherited Stahleck. The non-allodial remainder of the County reverted to the Crown and was subsequently bestowed on the Bavarian Duke Ludwig I of the House of Wittelsbach. =Wittelsbach ownership= Otto II of Bavaria and Agnes of the Palatinate in a 16th-century painting based on a 15th-century original In order to secure possession also of the castle and the overseership of Bacharach, Ludwig I arranged a marriage in 1222 between his son Otto and Agnes. Under Otto (Otto II) in 1243, the long-running conflict with the Archbishopric of Cologne was settled, and he received F√ºrstenberg and Stahlberg Castles as additional fiefs. Ludwig I transferred his primary residence to Heidelberg, so that from then on, Stahleck was used only occasionally and was overseen by counts, who called themselves \\"Ritter (Knight) von Stahleck\\". From the 15th century on, it was administered by bailiffs. However, although the castle was no longer the administrative centre of the Palatinate, important gatherings of the nobility continued to take place there into the 15th century, including the election of Ludwig IV as King of Germany in May 1314 and the wedding of Emperor Charles IV and Anna, only daughter of Rudolf II, Count Palatine, on 4 March 1349. In addition, the castle was used several times during the 14th century as a pledge. In December 1314, to cover the costs of his election, Ludwig IV pledged it for 58,300 pounds of Hellers to John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia, and his uncle Baldwin, Electoral Archbishop of Triers. In July 1328, they were required to surrender Stahleck and also Stahlberg and Braunshorn Castles as security for a fine payable to Countess Loretta of Sponheim. The castle was thus administered by Count Wilhelm I of Katzenelnbogen as regent until the entire sum of 11,000 pounds had been paid. The castle was also opened for military use to Gerlach of Nassau, Archbishop of Mainz, in 1346. In 1353, the Palatinate was divided and Stahleck Castle passed to Rupert the Younger, after which it was incorporated into the fortifications around the town of Bacharach. In late 1400, Rupert's son, also named Rupert, celebrated there his election as King of Germany and Rome after the deposition of King Wenceslaus of Luxembourg. In 1408, Rupert hosted a banquet for the Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, but after that Stahleck gradually lost its importance for the empire. In 1442 Ludwig IV, Count Palatine, held a reception and electoral banquet there for King Frederick of Habsburg as he was en route to Aachen to be crowned Emperor, but during the 15th and 16th centuries the castle sank into insignificance. =Destruction in the 17th century= Spanish forces defend Stahleck Castle against recapture by Swedes in 1632; engraving by Matth√§us Merian, 1646 After the introduction of cannon, an artillery platform was added to the medieval castle on the northeast side to cover the access route, but its exact date of construction is unknown. Despite this, the castle was besieged, conquered, and sacked a total of eight times during the Thirty Years' War. On 4 October 1620, it and the town of Bacharach were taken by Spanish troops commanded by Ambrogio Spinola, but the Spaniards were evicted by Protestant Swedes on 9 January 1632. The castle was heavily damaged during the siege leading up to its recapture. A copper engraving in Matth√§us Merian's 1646 Topographia Germaniae depicts the battle. In July 1635, Imperial troops under Matthias Gallas, Count of Campo, successfully besieged Stahleck. They were evicted four years later, in July 1639, by Saxe-Weimar soldiers, but the castle was then occupied by Bavarian troops in March 1640. They stayed only a short time, and after their withdrawal the Saxe-Weimar troops reoccupied the castle and the town. In autumn 1640, after a 14-day siege, Spanish troops once more took their place. Stahleck Castle in 1663, with damage from the Thirty Years' War; drawing by Lambert Doomer In September 1644, the castle and the town were taken by French soldiers after a 10-day siege; the following month, Cologne troops attacked them and forced them to retreat to the castle with heavy losses. The Cologne commander, Constantin von Nievenheimb, therefore ordered the bombardment and \\"more or less ruination\\" of the castle,St√ºber, p. 36: \\"Oberst von Nievenheimb . . . lie√ü es dadurch 'ziemlicherweise ruinieren'\\" but did not attempt to capture it. The French soldiers remained until 24 July 1650 but had to vacate the castle under the terms of the Peace of Westphalia, which returned it to the Palatinate and Count Palatine Karl Ludwig. In 1666, he had the castle repaired and made some alterations: he greatly changed the interior of the palas and between it and the northern rampart built a massive new building with a Fachwerk half-timbered upper storey. An inscribed stone tablet on the palas commemorates his rebuilding of the castle. During the War of the Palatine Succession, the castle was decisively destroyed, like most of the fortifications in the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. Its commander, von Dachenhausen, surrendered it to French troops on 11 October 1688, but on 15 March 1689 they blew it up.Taylor, p. 12: They inserted explosives in the walls in at least 8 points, and the rock under the castle appears to have been split by the explosion. The explosion completely destroyed both the ring wall and the keep, the residential buildings burned out in the resulting fire, and debris from the explosion destroyed the Gothic Werner Chapel at the foot of the castle hill. The castle was so heavily damaged that it was not rebuilt. Under the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, the ruin reverted to the Palatinate, where it remained until the dissolution of the County at the end of the 18th century. =French and Prussian ownership= The ruined castle in an 1840 engraving After the occupation of the parts of the Palatinate on the left bank of the Rhine by French Revolutionary troops in 1794, in 1801 the Treaty of Lun√©ville awarded the ruined castle to the French; in 1804 they offered it for sale. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna resulted in its passing into the possession of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1828 the then Crown Prince Frederick William acquired it in order to give it to his wife Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria; she was a Wittelsbach princess. In association with a visit by her in the 1850s, large parts of the toppling walls were cleared,Taylor, p. 285. and the rubble spread over the courtyard and used to fill the moat. All that remained was the wall of the palas on the courtyard side, the ring wall on the Steeg valley side to the height of the chemin de ronde and a small piece of the inner or shield wall. The ruined castle became well known among romantics and nationalists and was often depicted in the 19th century. Beginning in 1907, Axel Delmar had plans for a home for artists in the ruins of the castle, but the Prussian royal family refused to sell the site. =20th-century rebuilding= 20th century rebuilding work done on Stahleck The first work to stabilise and rebuild the ring wall and shield wall, costing 3,500 marks, began only in 1909, after the ruin had been transferred from the Prussian Crown to the Rhenish Association for Landmark Preservation and Landscape Protection. The Association was able to raise the 5,000 mark purchase price through donations. Work was interrupted by World War I, and the castle suffered further vandalism and decay. In 1924 Richard Blankenhorn, the owner of the villa above the castle, wished to start a business in the ruins, but there was no response for 5 years to his enquiry concerning a lease. Early in 1925 the decision was taken to construct a youth hostel at the castle. Firm plans were made in March of that year. The Association contracted with the architect Ernst Stahl to \\"build in the ruin, in the spirit of the old buildings and making use of the old walls, a building which [would] fit well into the landscape\\".\\"im Sinne der alten Bauten und unter Verwendung der alten Mauern in die Ruine ein Haus einzubauen, das sich dem Landschaftsbild gut einf√ºgt.\\" - cited in Gabriele Nina Bode, \\"Burgenportr√§t: Burg Stahleck, Stadt Bacharach/Rhein (Kreis Mainz-Bingen)\\", Burgen und Schl√∂sser 42 (2001) 2-11, p. 6 Financing of the initial work was ensured by an endowment of 50,000 reichsmarks. Longhouse, built as a boys' hostel in 1925/26 Stahleck became the Association's prestige project. The intention was to completely rebuild the castle. Stahl based his designs on historical models and appended them to remaining structures, but changed his plans again after ancient, previously unknown building foundations came to light in excavations beginning in August 1925. The excavations and the attendant repeated surveying of the site delayed the start of building to late summer 1925. The first building, the longhouse, was intended as a hostel for boys. On the first floor, executed in Fachwerk, were a flat for the hostel manager and an adjacent dormitory with washroom. On the ground floor, built in crushed stone, were the kitchen and a day-room, while the top floor, which has dormers on the courtyard side, housed further sleeping and washing space. The design adhered as far as possible to the use of space in the old castle. An old cellar at the east corner of the site was rebuilt and roofed over in reinforced concrete to make a viewing terrace. Further excavations took place parallel to the construction work, and recovered stones were used as building material in rebuilding the ring wall and the foundation of the keep. Tower building, formerly girls' hostel, completed in 1927 The official dedication of the youth hostel took place on 12-13 June 1926 and was followed by a second building phase, from autumn 1926 to July 1927, in which the tower building, with two wings at right angles and a turret at the angle, was built as a girls' hostel on the foundations of two Fachwerk buildings against the shield wall. The ground floor consisted of a large day-room; on the first floor were a large dormitory, washrooms and living and sleeping space for matrons. Further sleeping space was under the single-pitched roof, and in addition there was a 4-bed room inside the turret. Rebuilding of the entire ring wall and the shield wall lasted until 1927. Once open, the youth hostel was almost always oversubscribed, leading to problems with the water supply. Insufficient water frequently led to a complete ban on washing. The problem was alleviated by tapping a new source of water on the western hillside. In 1929, the keep, with two holes in it from the explosion, was finally stabilised to a height of 3 m. The hole on the east side was used as an entrance to the tower. Also in 1929, the day-rooms were redecorated with dados and murals. In 1930-31, the ground floor of the ruined palas was rebuilt, to make a dining hall, a dishwashing room, and a flat for the hostel manager. In 1932, work was done on clearing the rubble from the moat. =Under National Socialism= Stahleck Castle in the 1930s, with new hostel buildings and unfinished keep Since there was still insufficient space in the hostel, which had over 30,000 overnight stays in 1934,Bacharacher Nachrichten, cited in Uwe Bader and Beate Welter, \\"Die Burg Stahleck - in der NS-Zeit nicht nur Jugendherberge\\", Bl√§tter zum Land (Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung, Rheinland-Pfalz) 2 (2001) (pdf) p. 2 the palas was completely rebuilt, providing 260 beds. The ceremonial laying of its foundation stone took place on 18 November 1934. The work, which took only 11 months, cost 25,000 reichsmarks and included addition of a kitchen, another Fachwerk building, on the south side. On 25 October 1935, the rebuilt building was officially dedicated. In the presence of members of the Hitler Jugend, the Deutsches Jungvolk, the Bund Deutscher M√§del, and both the SA and the SS, Gauleiter Gustav Simon gave the dedicatory address.Bader and Welter, p. 2. Stahleck became one of 27 Jugendburgen (youth castles), to be used for indoctrination of teenagers and young adults.Taylor, pp. 285, 287. Between 1937 and early 1938, the turrets on the shield wall were built and its chemin de ronde roofed over. A visit by Rudolf Hess in June 1938 prompted the start of work to complete the rebuilding of the keep, which was still a ruined stump. The plan was to reconstruct it to a height of 36 m, 7 storeys, and name it the Rudolf Hess Tower. However, the existing foundations would not have been able to bear the weight, so the ruin was pulled down, and in November 1938, work began on a completely new tower on a smaller footprint. Work on this was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. From 1940 to 1942, the castle served as a military hospital. In addition, in November 1940, students from now occupied Luxembourg who had been studying at German and Austrian universities when the war began were forced to attend re-education classes there,Bader and Welter, pp. 2-3. and eventually a youth re-education camp was set up. Male schoolchildren and students from Esch-sur-Alzette and Echternach were interned at the castle for 4 months as punishment for protesting against the announcement in 1942 of the introduction of required military service in Luxembourg and the forced conscription associated with it, as well as for participating in the general strike which followed.Bade and Welter, pp. 3-4.Michael P. Fuhr, Wer will des Stromes H√ºter sein?: 40 Burgen und Schl√∂sser am Mittelrhein - ein F√ºhrer, Regensburg: Schnell & Steiner, 2002, , p. 42 (Girls were sent to a youth hostel at Adenau.) Those of military age were then sent to the front.Bader and Welter, p. 4. There is a memorial plaque at the castle, and the State of Rhineland-Palatinate and the City of Bacharach have organised memorial events at which contemporary witnesses spoke.Bader and Welter, p. 8. Beginning in January 1943, the castle was used as an internment camp for German youth who had shown insufficient loyalty to the Party, such as the founders of the Catholic youth resistance group the Michael Troop; some were taken from Stahleck to concentration camps.Bader and Welter, pp. 6-7. From June 1943 to summer 1944, it was a work and military training camp for Germans between 14 and 18 years of age. =After the war and today= The keep (bergfried), completed in 1966/67 Following the end of the war, Stahleck Castle was first used to billet French soldiers, before returning to use as a youth hostel in November 1947. The Health and Welfare Ministry of Rhineland- Palatinate opened a youth leadership school at the castle in January 1948 to train prospective hostel managers and staff, but was forced to close it at the end of the same year because of the state's poor financial situation. The hostel itself, however, was unaffected. In 1957 the castle offered 270 beds and 60 emergency spaces and was thus the third largest youth hostel in Rhineland-Palatinate, after those in Koblenz and Mainz. In terms of overnight stays, it was in second place with 32,276. Beginning in October 1965, a further building programme was carried out at the castle under government superintendent of works Heinrich Grimm, based on the plans of Stahl, who had died in 1957. This included interior modernisation and renovation and a new administration building. In addition, a large terrace was created on the south side, and beginning in 1966 the still incomplete keepdescribed by Gibbon in 1957 as \\"merely a low, squat, reconstructed affair, with a huge platform on top\\" (p. 125). was built up a further 4 m and topped with a tall cone-shaped roof. The ceremonial reopening took place on 20 May 1967. The castle is still used as a hostel, now leased by the Rhineland-Palatinate Youth Hostel Association. It currently offers 168 beds and has approximately 42,000 overnights per year. It is almost always booked up. In the 1990s the non- visitor facilities were once more modernised at a cost of 8.3 million marks. Architecture =Until 1689= A series of archaeological excavations between 1925 and 1927 revealed many previously hidden foundations of medieval buildings at the castle site, making it possible to reconstruct what was there before the castle was destroyed in 1689. According to the evidence, since the Middle Ages, Stahleck Castle had had 3 entrances. One was a double gate reached by steps from the Rhine Valley, leading into a small, elongated zwinger, from which entry to the castle was through a double-barred door in the northern shield wall, 8 m from the northwest corner. The former main gate was in the west corner, on the site of today's main entrance, and could be reached either from the northern zwinger or by way of a drawbridge from a group of outbuildings to the southwest. The main gate led to a gate zwinger and an inside gate from which a narrow passage led to the courtyard. The third entrance consisted of a small door in the outside wall of the southern zwinger, which was parallel to the ring wall and had a round tower at the south corner. Immediately inside the northern ring wall was a longish building with a stone residential building attached to its northern end. Its ground floor was divided into several small rooms, and at the south end there was a timber-framed building whose outside wall was the southern defensive wall. Two more timber-framed buildings stood on the west side in the shelter of a shield wall which protected the castle on the side where the hillside is higher. The buildings thus enclosed a long, narrow inner courtyard, in the centre of which was a round Romanesque keep (bergfried), with an outside wall 4 m thick. Water was supplied to the castle by a well sunk into the hillside within the shield wall. It was connected by a tunnel at a depth of approximately four metres to the moat outside the walls. Finds of fragments of early Gothic vaulting and of a Gothic window showed that the castle had a chapel. Until then, the only evidence had been a mention in the 1471 testament of Ruprecht of the Palatinate, Archbishop of Cologne. It is impossible to know exactly where the chapel was, but it is presumed to have been on the first floor of the palas, where Merian's engraving shows a small bay window on the Rhine side of the building. In addition to the still existing artillery platform on the southwest side, there was a bastion in the northeast. =Today= The castle today is a 20th-century reconstruction,Taylor, p. 286, Fig. 48 caption. primarily based on the results of excavation and the 1646 engraving by Matth√§us Merian. The rebuilding plans were mostly the work of Ernst Stahl, who closely followed Merian's depiction and used other historical models where the engraving gave no information. For example, the almost rectangular shape of the castle, measuring approximately 55 by 24 m, shows the typical regular layout and clear divisions of a castle of the Hohenstaufen period. The size of the modern buildings approximates that of those in the original castle; the oldest portions are the foundations of the keep, parts of the cellar under the palas and sections of the curtain wall. Since the castle is used as a hostel, it is not available for tours. However, the courtyard is accessible to the public and offers a fine view of the Rhine, since on that side there is only a low parapet. Palas The palas, between the longhouse (left) and the kitchen building (right) The palas (residential building) is 2 storeys high, built of crushed stone lined with Rhenish Schwemmstein (a traditional artificial material made of dried pumice and lime, similar to concrete), and stands at the eastern, Rhine valley end of the courtyard, over a vaulted cellar that Ernst Stahl dated to the time of Conrad of Hohenstaufen. It has a shingled hip roof 10 m high. Adjoining it on the southwest side is the so- called kitchen building, with Fachwerk first floor, which today is the residence of the hostel managers. On the courtyard side, a red sandstone tablet commemorates Duke Karl Ludwig's rebuilding of the castle. The inscription reads: :CARL LVDWIG PFALTZGRAF CHVRF√úRST ERNEVERT MICH ANNO 1666 (Carl Ludwig, Count Palatine [and] Elector, remade me in the year 1666) Of the numerous details that Stahl once envisaged incorporating in the rebuilding of the castle, only the windows and chandeliers of the great hall exist today. The 11 windows of the hall, made of stained glass by the D√ºsseldorf glass painter Richard Gassen, depict the most important events in the history of the castle and the arms of the people or institutions of the Rhine Province in the 1920s. They are framed by versions in basalt which can only be seen from outside. The room has an oak plank floor and holds approximately 100 people. Bergfried Although documentary evidence leads to the conclusion that the castle was built in the 12th century at the latest, the archaeological investigations have been unable to provide proof. Stahl believed, however, that the preserved foundations of the bergfried (keep) should be dated to the 12th century. The keep is a round tower 7.5 m in diameter which stands on bedrock in the centre of the inner courtyard. It has walls 2 metres thick and is topped by a 16 m cone-shaped roof. The top floor, 4 m high, was added later, which can be seen from the different colour of the stone. Shield wall and main entrance Main gate and shield wall The castle is defended from the high hillside on the west by a chemise wall which has been fortified to form a shield wall 2.6 m thick. There is an interior stairway, which does not, however, reach as far as the roofed chemin de ronde at the top of the wall; it is used to reach the upper floors of the 1930s tower building. Some of the tall, narrow embrasures were subsequently walled closed at the base and fitted with wooden frames to absorb the recoil of early firearms. Their fishtail shape indicates that the wall dates to the first half of the 14th century. At the top they are flanked on both sides by polygonal turrets which replaced two earlier round towers. Below the shield wall is a moat cut out of the rock. A section of this measuring 18 by 13 metres is separated off and filled with water, doubling as a cistern. A stone bridge leads over the moat to the main entrance; the gateway is guarded by an embrasured turret above and leads to an elongated zwinger. Other structures The former boys' hostel is now called the longhouse. It has a ground floor of crushed stone and a Fachwerk first floor. The slate roof has a dormer on the courtyard side with a curved gable. What is now known as the tower building, formerly the girls' hostel, stands against the shield wall. It resembles the longhouse in its details. A walled platform cut out of the rock a little above the castle to the southwest is a post-medieval position for artillery aimed at the hillside which was an important part of the castle's defences after the introduction of gunpowder.

The title is taken from the song \\"Pennies from Heaven\\" written by Johnny Burke and Arthur Johnston. It was one of several Potter serials (another being The Singing Detective) to mix the reality of the drama with a dark fantasy content, and the earliest of his works where the characters burst into extended performances of popular songs. Synopsis ;\\"Part 1 Down Sunnyside Lane\\" In the mid-1930s, Arthur and Joan Parker (Bob Hoskins and Gemma Craven) are an incompatible married couple living in the London suburbs. Arthur, a travelling sheet music salesman, is a passionate man who is frustrated by his wife's domestic nature. On a car journey to the Gloucester area he picks up 'the accordion man', a vagrant (Kenneth Colley) who invariably busks on the instrument in the vicinity of the other characters, but the signs of the man's mental illness soon lead Arthur to reject him after they spend several hours together. While trying to persuade a shopkeeper (Arnold Peters) to take some of his goods, Arthur notices a female customer with whom he immediately becomes besotted. Arthur and 'the accordion man' both manage to frighten the young woman. Before returning to London, Arthur has sex with Marjorie (Rosemary Martin), a Gloucestershire prostitute, in the back of his car. ;\\"Part 2 The Sweetest Thing\\" Arthur's bank manager (Peter Cellier) refuses to give him a loan. Eileen Everson (Cheryl Campbell), the woman he encountered, is a junior school teacher in the Forest of Dean who lives with her widowed coal mining father and two brothers, also miners. Meanwhile, Arthur has returned to the area to trace the woman with whom he is obsessed. He finally encounters Eileen in a wood near the Eversons' cottage, and returns to their home where Arthur claims his wife has died in a motorcycle accident. He and Eileen eventually make love after the rest of the household have gone to bed. ;\\"Part 3 Easy Come, Easy Go\\" The Parkers' marriage briefly revives after Joan smears lipstick on her nipples, and appears to respond to some of her husband's sexual fantasies. Joan is persuaded to use her inheritance to finance Arthur's desire to open a record shop. Meanwhile, Eileen has discovered she is pregnant and is forced to give up her job. After unexpectedly meeting a young blind girl (Yolande Palfrey) in a field, whom he lusts after under his breath, Arthur reappears at the Everson family home, and his relationship with Eileen revives. The blind girl is raped and murdered, for which Arthur is arrested, but soon released. Eileen moves to London, and loses contact with Arthur again. ;\\"Part 4 Better Think Twice\\" Almost destitute, Eileen eats little and is in arrears for her cheap hotel room. She meets the superficially sympathetic Tom (Hywel Bennett), a wealthy man with no obvious occupation, and becomes dependent upon him. Arthur opens his new record shop, but he has very few customers, an exception being Tom. The two men get along very well, and Arthur delivers some records to the apartment where Eileen is recovering from an (illegal) abortion paid for by Tom, but the couple are not reunited. Arthur later glimpses Eileen in the pub where she had met Tom, and they leave for the record shop. Unaware of Arthur's connection to Tom, Eileen explains that the man who paid for her abortion now has a hold over her, and he intends to be her pimp. The couple decide they have to escape from London, and shatter Arthur's stock of fragile shellac discs. ;\\"Part 5 Painting the Clouds\\" A police inspector (Dave King) visits Joan after Arthur's unexplained disappearance and the destruction of his retail stock. Her comments about Arthur's sexual tastes, particularly his wish for his wife to move around the house without wearing her knickers, lead the police to make a connection with the murder of the blind girl whose undergarment had been removed. 'The accordion man' is haunted by her image and his responsibility for the murder. (It is clear he is not delusional over this event.) He is disorientated when running into Eileen while she is street walking; the dead girl bears a resemblance to her. Arthur is now living off Eileen's immoral earnings, and she is a client of a Conservative MP, Major Archibald Paxville (Ronald Fraser), who she unsuccessfully attempts to blackmail. 'The accordion man' commits suicide, probably by throwing himself off Hammersmith Bridge (which also features ominously in The Singing Detective), and his corpse is discovered. Arthur and Eileen's false optimism for the future is dashed when they see a newspaper headline indicating he is wanted for murder. ;\\"Part 6 Says My Heart\\" Arthur and Eileen are on the run. They spend the night in a barn, but Eileen's attempt to find help eventually leads her to shoot dead a lonely and deranged farmer (Philip Locke). They feed and clean themselves in his farmhouse, and scavenge through the man's possessions for money and things they can sell. Leaving the farm Arthur stops, thinking he has seen 'the accordion man', but cannot restart their stolen car. Passing police take the couple in for questioning, and Arthur is charged with the murder of the blind girl. In the Assizes court inconsistencies in Arthur's various accounts, and a witness unwittingly confusing Arthur's fixation on Eileen for an obsession with the blind girl lead to his conviction and execution. After Eileen notes the time set for his hanging has passed, Arthur reappears and a happy ending is announced by the two characters. Overview Hoskins became an established actor in the United Kingdom following his role in this serial. The serial was directed by Piers Haggard and produced by long-time Potter collaborator Kenith Trodd. The series also featured Nigel Havers as Conrad Baker (the suave salesman); Jenny Logan as Irene (Joan's friend); Freddie Jones as Mr. Warner (Eileen's headmaster); Michael Bilton as Eileen's dad; Will Stamp as the Barman; Tudor Davies as the cafe customer (Davies was also choreographer for the series) and Peter Bowles as the Prosecuting Counsel. Pennies was the last of Potter's television dramas to be filmed in the 'hybrid' format of studio videotape and location 16mm film. The production involved six weeks of filming on location, most of it in Oxfordshire, but with selected shooting in the Forest of Dean (in Potter's home county of Gloucestershire, between the River Severn and the River Wye). The school where Eileen teaches is the actual Forest school Potter attended in Berry Hill, and the children who populate the school scenes were local children cast as extras. In temporary remission from his chronic condition of psoriatic arthropathy, a rare skin and joints disease that first afflicted him at the age of 24, Potter and his wife Margaret were able to visit the location shoot in Dean. Pennies was transmitted in six episodes of approximately 75 minutes each from 7 March to 11 April 1978, on BBC1, and first repeated later that year.Humphrey Carpenter Dennis Potter: A Biography, London: Faber, 1998 [1999 pbk], p.372 In the spring of the following year, Pennies won the British Academy Television Award for Most Original Programme (Hoskins & Campbell were also nominated for BAFTA acting awards). In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, Pennies from Heaven was placed at number 21. Film adaptation In 1981, the series was adapted as a film, starring Steve Martin. Potter adapted his own screenplay, and Herbert Ross directed. Potter was nominated for the 1981 Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay ‚Äî according to The Times, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had him rewrite the script thirteen times. By most accounts, the movie was a resounding flop, despite the contributions of Bernadette Peters (as Eileen), Christopher Walken (as Tom) and Vernel Bagneris (as 'the accordion man'). The MGM deal with Potter had multiple ramifications. Said producer Trodd in a 1990 Times article: \\"Bob [Hoskins] and Cheryl [Campbell] were terribly upset that they weren't considered for the film. I think they still blame Dennis and me in some way, but there was no way to argue the point with MGM.'\\" MGM also required Potter to buy back his copyright from the BBC (according to the same 1990 Times article, Potter paid the BBC \\"something over $100,000\\" for the script). In addition, MGM prohibited broadcast of the BBC's own production of Pennies for approximately ten years. In 1989 or thereabouts, at the prompting of Alan Yentob, the controller of BBC2, Trodd was able to buy back the rights from MGM at \\"a very inconsiderable sum.\\" The BBC promptly rebroadcast Pennies in February 1990. Legacy The original television version was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2004. The first and sixth episodes have an audio commentary from Haggard and Trodd. Potter's memorial service in November 1994 at St James's Church in Piccadilly began with those in attendance singing \\"Roll Along Prairie Moon\\" to the accompaniment of a jazz quintet. Cheryl Campbell and Freddie Jones read their scene in the schoolroom from Pennies: \\"As Jones stifled his tears, Campbell said: 'Nobody ever ever stops yearning' . . . In a comic interlude Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1, and Kenith Trodd, Potter's producer, read a scene from Pennies. [And Trodd] told of their last meeting before the playwright's death from cancer: 'Dennis slugging Courvoisier, fortified by liquid heroin and morphine . . . after an hour he seemed to crumple and he said, 'I do have one very real fear of death. It is that you might get asked to speak at my memorial service'.\\" See also *Al Bowlly, song composer used extensively throughout the series References Further reading * External links Entry on British Film Institute's Top 100 television programs *Encyclopedia of Television *British Film Institute Screen Online *\\"Deep in Dennis Potter's Forest\\", The American Prospect magazine Category:1978 British television series debuts Category:1978 British television series endings Category:1970s British drama television series Category:BBC television dramas Category:BBC television musicals Category:1970s British television miniseries Category:Jukebox musicals Category:British musical television series Category:Television shows written by Dennis Potter Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series set in the 1930s ","title":"Pennies from Heaven (TV series)"},{"id":"906773","text":"Anglo-Spanish War refers to: * Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604) - including the Spanish Armada and the English Armada * Anglo-Spanish War (1625‚Äì1630) - part of the Thirty Years' War * Anglo-Spanish War (1654‚Äì1660) - part of the Franco- Spanish War * Portuguese Restoration War (1662‚Äì1668) - English support for Portugal * War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1713) - British support to Archduke Charles * War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718‚Äì1720) * Anglo-Spanish War (1727‚Äì1729) * War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) - later merged into the War of the Austrian Succession * Anglo-Spanish War (1762‚Äì1763) - part of the Seven Years' War * Anglo-Spanish War (1779‚Äì1783) - linked to the American Revolutionary War * Anglo-Spanish War (1796‚Äì1808) - part of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars * The Spanish American wars of independence (1815‚Äì1832) - linked to the Decolonization of the Americas * First Carlist War (1833‚Äì1840) - British support to Queen Isabella II See also * Falklands Crisis of 1770 * Nootka Crisis ","title":"Anglo-Spanish War"},{"id":"906776","text":"Progress Energy, headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a subsidiary of Duke Energy and prior to its merger with Duke Energy was a Fortune 500 energy company with more than 21,000 megawatts of generation capacity and $9 billion in annual revenues.

Early and family life He was born in Lewisburg, Virginia in a portion of the state along the Ohio River which became West Virginia in his lifetime. His father had been born in Shenandoah County and moved across the Appalachian Mountains to the Greenbrier County area, but died when Charles was an infant. His paternal grandfather had married a daughter of Joseph Morgan, who helped settle the trans-Appalachian area. His mother, Augusta Delphia Page of Staunton, Virginia, a daughter of Major Charles Page, died in 1844 so Charles and his sister were raised by their uncle, George Moore in Mason County. When Charles was 16, he was sent to Marshall Academy in Huntington, and he would also study with John I Van Meter in Pike County, Pennsylvania, then attend Jefferson College (which later became Washington and Jefferson College) in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. While at Jefferson College, Charles Moore helped found the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity before graduating in 1853. Moore then briefly attended Union College in New York. Returning to Virginia, he studied law at the University of Virginia and completed the course in 1856. He married Urilla Katherine Kline (1835-1897) of Hagerstown, Maryland, and they had four daughters: Ida Ogden Moore (1867‚Äì1948), Rebecca Francis Moore Bland (1870‚Äì1967), Mai L Moore (1873‚Äì1965) and Elizabeth Van Meter Moore (1874‚Äì1948). Career Admitted to the Virginia bar, Moore established his legal practice at Point Pleasant along the Ohio River near his foster father's farm. In 1860 he won election as the Commonwealth's attorney for Mason County. At various times he had legal partnerships with Nicholas Fitzhugh, James H. Couch and William Tomlinson.Robert H. Ferguson, History of Mason County, West Virginia (1961; COlonel Charles Lewis Chapter NSDAR Point Pleasant, West Virginia Typescript) p. 154 After former Confederates were again allowed to hold office, Moore defeated Republican James F. Brown in 1870. He sat as a judge in the first session of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in 1870. Two years later, West Virginia adopted a new state Constitution, thereby cutting short all the terms of the three-judge court. Moore was a nominee of both parties in 1872 and among the five judges elected to the new Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. He wrote and delivered 107 opinions before resigning in May 1881.Ferguson p. 154 His successor, Richmond-born James French Patton, a fellow Democrat, had been a former Confederate officer.

The purpose of such a definition is to exclude functions that do not provide an upper bound on the runtime of some Turing machine. Time-constructible definitions There are two different definitions of a time-constructible function. In the first definition, a function f is called time-constructible if there exists a positive integer n0 and Turing machine M which, given a string 1n consisting of n ones, stops after exactly f(n) steps for all n ‚â• n0. In the second definition, a function f is called time-constructible if there exists a Turing machine M which, given a string 1n, outputs the binary representation of f(n) in O(f(n)) time (a unary representation may be used instead, since the two can be interconverted in O(f(n)) time). There is also a notion of a fully time-constructible function. A function f is called fully time-constructible if there exists a Turing machine M which, given a string 1n consisting of n ones, stops after exactly f(n) steps. This definition is slightly less general than the first two but, for most applications, either definition can be used. Space-constructible definitions Similarly, a function f is space-constructible if there exists a positive integer n0 and a Turing machine M which, given a string 1n consisting of n ones, halts after using exactly f(n) cells for all n ‚â• n0. Equivalently, a function f is space- constructible if there exists a Turing machine M which, given a string 1n consisting of n ones, outputs the binary (or unary) representation of f(n), while using only O(f(n)) space. Also, a function f is fully space- constructible if there exists a Turing machine M which, given a string 1n consisting of n ones, halts after using exactly f(n) cells. Examples All the commonly used functions f(n) (such as n, nk, 2n) are time- and space- constructible, as long as f(n) is at least cn for a constant c > 0. No function which is o(n) can be time-constructible unless it is eventually constant, since there is insufficient time to read the entire input. However, is a space-constructible function. Applications Time-constructible functions are used in results from complexity theory such as the time hierarchy theorem. They are important because the time hierarchy theorem relies on Turing machines that must determine in O(f(n)) time whether an algorithm has taken more than f(n) steps. This is, of course, impossible without being able to calculate f(n) in that time. Such results are typically true for all natural functions f but not necessarily true for artificially constructed f. To formulate them precisely, it is necessary to have a precise definition for a natural function f for which the theorem is true. Time- constructible functions are often used to provide such a definition. Space- constructible functions are used similarly, for example in the space hierarchy theorem.

He had two short professional wrestling stints, wrestling Hulk Hogan in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after appearing as Zeus in the 1989 movie No Holds Barred and resuming the feud as Z-Gangsta in 1996 for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He is blind in his right eye. Early life Lister was born in Compton, California, on June 24, 1958. Lister was born blind in his right eye due to a detached and deformed retina. He avoided the local gang life in Compton by developing an interest in films and religion instead. Lister attended Palomar Junior College before transferring to Long Beach City College for his sophomore year. While at Long Beach, he recorded a shot put throw, which helped to earn him a scholarship to California State University at Los Angeles. In his senior year, he won the national shot put title with a mark of over . Lister was the 1982 NCAA Division II National Shot Put Champion. After college, Lister competed for the Converse Track Club, eventually raising his shot put mark to , before trying out with the New Orleans Breakers of the United States Football League. He was cut after two exhibition games, and opted to pursue acting instead. Acting career Lister is best known as Deebo from Friday. Deebo was the neighborhood bully and antagonist to Ice Cube's character, Craig Jones. He reprised the role in the film's sequel, Next Friday, but did not appear in the third film of the series, Friday After Next. He did, however, appear in Cube's director debut The Players Club. He also played the role of Obodo in Mario Van Peeble's \\"Posse\\" (1993). Lister has had numerous guest appearances on TV series, including playing Klaang, the first Klingon ever to make contact with humans, in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. He co-starred in a two-part episode of the courtroom series Matlock as Mr. Matlock's in-prison bodyguard. He also appeared in season 7 episode 09 of \\"In the Heat of the Night\\". Lister's film roles include playing a prisoner in The Dark Knight, Austin Powers in Goldmember and The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence). Lister was featured in The Fifth Element as the Galactic President. He appeared in the Adam Sandler film Little Nicky as Nicky's older brother Cassius. Lister was the main police officer in Chamillionaire's \\"Ridin'\\" video, and reprised his role as a police officer in Chamillionaire's 2012 single Show Love. He has also appeared in the Ice Cube videos for \\"Friday\\" (from the Friday soundtrack) and \\"You Can Do It\\" (from the Next Friday soundtrack). Lister appeared via both original footage and film clips from the movie. He was also in the videos for Young Bleed's \\"How You Do Dat\\"; French Montana's \\"I Told 'Em\\" and 50 Cent's \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\". Lister also portrayed Sancho in the Sublime music video \\"Santeria\\". In the Quentin Tarantino film Jackie Brown, he played bail agent Winston, who \\"finds people who don't want to be found\\". In 2015, Lister filmed Busy Day in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The film was produced by Tam√°s N√°das. Lister had a supporting role in the 2016 Disney animated movie Zootopia as the voice of the diminutive fennec fox, Finnick. He also appeared in a commercial that year for Ball Park-brand beef jerky, advertised as \\"tough, but tender.\\" Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Federation (1989-1990)= Lister appeared in the 1989 wrestling movie No Holds Barred, which was financed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and starred Hulk Hogan. Lister's role was Zeus, a brutal monster heel. No Holds Barred inspired a feud in the WWF during the latter half of 1989. Lister was billed as \\"Zeus: The Human Wrecking Machine\\", and used the same \\"monster heel\\" gimmick in his matches by no selling his opponent's more lethal moves. Zeus would shout \\"aw aw\\" and pound on his chest during interviews and matches, and sometimes mispronounce wrestler's names, such as referring to Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake as \\"Beefcake Barber\\". Eventually, Zeus demanded Hogan face him in the ring. Citing jealousy for being billed under Hogan and anger over losing to Hogan in the movie, Zeus now wanted to beat him in \\"real life\\". Zeus formed an alliance with fellow Hogan rival \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage to feud with Hogan and his friend, Brutus Beefcake. The two teams faced off at the 1989 SummerSlam event in a tag team match which saw Hogan and Beefcake prevail as the victors, with Hogan pinning Zeus. Following SummerSlam, Zeus formed an alliance with \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase leading into the Survivor Series. At the event, the team of The Hulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, and Demolition) faced The Million Dollar Team (Ted DiBiase, Zeus, and the Powers of Pain). Zeus was eliminated from the match via disqualification after refusing to break a chokehold on Hogan and shoving the referee away. The Hulkamaniacs went on to win the match. After the Survivor Series, the feud between Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake versus Randy Savage and Zeus ended with a steel cage match on December 27, 1989 at the No Holds Barred pay-per-view event. Hogan and Beefcake were once again victorious in what would be Zeus's last match in the WWF. Lister's final WWF appearance was a promotional spot for the 1990 Royal Rumble. =World Wrestling Council (1990)= Following the feud with Hogan, Zeus continued to sporadically wrestle, most notably for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico, where he faced Abdullah the Butcher. =World Championship Wrestling (1996)= Lister also spent a short time in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Z-Gangsta, as part of The Alliance to End Hulkamania in March 1996, culminating at Uncensored. He debuted the previous week with fellow actor/wrestler Robert Swenson, who was billed as The Ultimate Solution. Honors and awards The athletic department of Lister's alma mater Cal State LA sponsors an annual track meet in his name. Personal life =Religious views= Lister is an evangelical born-again Christian. In 1999, he and Darryl Strawberry appeared on evangelist Benny Hinn's TV program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, in which they gave their testimonials. Afterward, Hinn laid hands on Lister and prophesied over him, \\"God is calling you to reach out to young people and will bless your acting career to do it.\\" Lister has continued to make appearances on faith-based networks and speaks to urban youth and at church functions across the country.

Appointment and subsequent trial  Seniloli was appointed Vice-President in 2000 as an apparent gesture of appeasement towards the supporters of the 2000 coup which deposed the lawfully elected government of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. The 6 August 2004 verdict found Seniloli guilty of unlawfully proclaiming himself President during the coup, and of illegally swearing in cabinet ministers, including George Speight, the chief instigator of the coup, as Prime Minister. Seniloli's lawyer, Mehboob Raza, maintained that he had done so only \\"under duress,\\" at gunpoint, a defence rejected by High Court Justice Nazhat Shameem, who agreed with the state prosecutor that Seniloli had known of the coup plot in advance and had deliberately aided and abetted it. Shameem said that she had originally intended to sentence Seniloli to six years' imprisonment, but had opted for a four-year sentence instead, taking account of his many years of service to Fiji, including thirty-three years as a schoolteacher. Along with Seniloli, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, and three other defendants, were sentenced to terms of between one and six years for the same offence. In a controversial move, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale announced on 29 November 2004 that he had decided to release Seniloli from prison on medical grounds, a decision which angered the Labour Party. \\"The FLP is outraged by the jailed VP's early release from prison,\\" declared Senator Jokapeci Koroi, the national president of the Labour Party. \\"This is nothing but a conspiracy by the Government to save those who are in positions of power.\\" Koroi called the release of Seniloli, who had served less than four months of his four-year term, an \\"act of defiance to subvert the course of justice and the rule of law.\\" Reverend Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum also criticized the release.  Reaction to release  The military forces were also displeased, and took what was widely seen as an extraordinary step by issuing a public statement. Captain Neumi Leweni of the Royal Fiji Military Forces media cell called the early release \\"an insult to our sense of justice and the rule of law\\" and a \\"riot.\\" \\"We are falling fast into the abyss and if nothing is done about this quickly, we will continue falling, never to recover,\\" Leweni said. He and other senior military said they believed the release of Ratu Jope was a political ploy to gain the support of \\"the same type of people who gathered in droves at the parliamentary complex in 2000\\" ‚Äì a reference to the supporters of the coup. The officers predicted that if the Attorney General was not reined in quickly, there could be \\"a return to the mayhem of 2000.\\" Leweni's judgement that Ratu Seniloli's release threatened national security was subsequently backed up by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the Commander of the Armed Forces. Joji Kotobalavu, a spokesman for Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, rejected the criticism and said that the military had acted improperly by issuing a political statement. The senior officers should have notified the Home Affairs Ministry of their feelings privately, he said, adding that by publicly airing their opinions, the military was creating a climate of \\"uncertainty,\\" leading people to wonder whether the government or the military was running the country. Ratu Seniloli's early release was coupled with his resignation from office. Although not stated, this was believed to be a condition of his release. A government spokesman said that Ratu Seniloli would receive a pension equivalent to 30 percent of his Vice- Presidential salary. By law, prisoners are not eligible for release until half their sentence has been served, but a special case was made for Seniloli due to the poor state of his health. He was released into \\"compulsory supervision,\\" under which he is required to report daily to the police, and is not allowed to change his address or travel outside of Fiji without permission.  Vice-President's constitutional role  The Fijian Constitution assigns a purely ceremonial role to the Vice-President, with one important exception: he assumes the powers and duties of the Presidency in the event of the President being unable to carry out his duties. With the 84-year-old President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo suffering from Parkinson's disease and requiring frequent visits to Australia for medical treatment, the resignation of the Vice-President left Fiji with no one to take Iloilo's place should he become incapacitated, and the appointment of a successor was considered a priority. On 15 December 2004, the Great Council of Chiefs approved President Iloilo's choice of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi as the new Vice-President.  Comeback in 2006?  * See main article: 2006 Fiji presidential election On 16 February 2006, the Fiji Village news service claimed that some Tailevu chiefs were quietly campaigning for the Great Council of Chiefs to reinstate Seniloli as Vice- President. The Council was due to meet as an electoral college on 8 March to choose the President and Vice-President, whose terms were due to expire. Without naming Seniloli, the Military expressed its opposition to any coup- convict being appointed President or Vice-President. Seniloli himself, however, revealed to Fiji Village on 22 February that as he was still technically serving his prison sentence extramurally, he was not eligible for reinstatement. He died on 28 June 2015 at the age of 76.

It was a military operation in which the Indian Armed Forces invaded the Nizam-ruled princely state, annexing it into the Indian Union. At the time of Partition in 1947, the princely states of India, who in principle had self- government within their own territories, were subject to subsidiary alliances with the British, giving them control of their external relations. In the Indian Independence Act 1947 the British abandoned all such alliances, leaving the states with the option of opting for full independence.See Section 7 (1) (b): \\"the suzerainty of His Majesty over the Indian States lapses, and with it, all treaties and agreements in force at the date of the passing of this Act between His Majesty and the rulers of Indian States, all functions exercisable by His Majesty at that date with respect to Indian States, all obligations of His Majesty existing at that date towards Indian States or the rulers thereof, and all powers, rights, authority or jurisdiction exercisable by His Majesty at that date in or in relation to Indian States by treaty, grant, usage, sufferance or otherwise.\\" However, by 1948 almost all had acceded to either India or Pakistan. One major exception was that of the wealthiest and most powerful principality, Hyderabad, where the Nizam, Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII, a Muslim ruler who presided over a largely Hindu population, chose independence and hoped to maintain this with an irregular army recruited from the Muslim aristocracy, known as the Razakars. The Nizam was also beset by the Telangana uprising, which he was unable to subjugate. In November 1947, Hyderabad signed a standstill agreement with the dominion of India, continuing all previous arrangements except for the stationing of Indian troops in the state. However, with the rise of militant Razakars, India found it necessary to station Indian troops and invaded the state in September 1948 to compel the Nizam. Subsequently, the Nizam signed an instrument of accession, joining India. The operation led to massive violence on communal lines. The Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, appointed a commission known as the Sunderlal Committee. Its report, which was not released until 2013, concluded that \\"as a very reasonable & modest estimate...the total number of deaths in the state...somewhere between 30,000 & 40,000.\\" Other responsible observers estimated the number of deaths to be 200,000 or higher.  Background  After the Siege of Golconda by the Mughal Empire in 1687, the region was renamed as Deccan Subah (due to its geographical proximity in the Deccan Plateau) and in 1713 Qamar-ud-din Khan (later known as Asaf Jah I or Nizam I) was appointed its Subahdar and bestowed with the title of Nizam-ul- Mulk by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar. Hyderabad's effective independence is dated to 1724, when the Nizam won a military victory over a rival military appointee. In 1798, Hyderabad became the first Indian princely state to accede to British protection under the policy of Subsidiary Alliance instituted by Arthur Wellesley, and was thus named as the State of Hyderabad. The State of Hyderabad under the leadership of its 7th Nizam, Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan, was the largest and most prosperous of all the princely states in India. With annual revenues of over Rs. 9 crore, it covered of fairly homogenous territory and comprised a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census) of which a majority (85%) was Hindu. The state had its own army, airline, telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and radio broadcasting service. Hyderabad was a multi-lingual state consisting of peoples speaking Telugu (48.2%), Marathi (26.4%), Kannada (12.3%) and Urdu (10.3%). In spite of the overwhelming Hindu majority, Hindus were severely under-represented in government, police and the military. Of 1765 officers in the State Army, 1268 were Muslims, 421 were Hindus, and 121 others were Christians, Parsis and Sikhs. Of the officials drawing a salary between Rs. 600 and 1200 per month, 59 were Muslims, 5 were Hindus and 38 were of other religions. The Nizam and his nobles, who were mostly Muslims, owned 40% of the total land in the state. When the British departed from the Indian subcontinent in 1947, they offered the various princely states in the sub- continent the option of acceding to either India or Pakistan, or staying on as an independent state. As stated by Sardar Patel at a press conference in January 1948, \\"As you are all aware, on the lapse of Paramountcy every Indian State became a separate independent entity.\\"R. P. Bhargava, The Chamber of Princes (Northern Book Centre, 1991) p. 313 In India, a small number of states, including Hyderabad, declined to join the new dominion. In the case of Pakistan, accession happened far more slowly.Yaqoob Khan Bangash, A Princely Affair: The Accession and Integration of the Princely States of Pakistan, 1947‚Äì1955 (Oxford University Press, 2015), pp. 7‚Äì12 Hyderabad had been part of the calculations of all-India political parties since the 1930s.Copland, Communalism' in Princely India\\", Roosa, 'Quadary of the Qaum' cited in Sherman, \\"Integration of Princely States\\" (2007) The leaders of the new Dominion of India were wary of a Balkanization of India if Hyderabad was left independent. Hyderabad state had been steadily becoming more theocratic since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1926, Mahmud Nawazkhan, a retired Hyderabad official, founded the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (also known as Ittehad or MIM). Its objectives were to unite the Muslims in the State in support of Nizam and to reduce the Hindu majority by large-scale conversion to Islam.Kate, P. V., Marathwada Under the Nizams, 1724‚Äì1948, Delhi: Mittal Publications, 1987, p.73 The MIM became a powerful communal organization, with the principal focus to marginalize the political aspirations of the Hindus and moderate Muslims. Events preceding hostilities =Political and diplomatic negotiations= Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam of Hyderabad, initially approached the British government with a request to take on the status of an independent constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations. This request was, however, rejected by the last Viceroy of India, The 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma. At the time of the British withdrawal from India, the Nizam announced that he did not intend to join either new dominion,E. W. R. Lumby, The Transfer of Power in India, 1945‚Äì1947 (1954), p. 232 and proceeded to appoint trade representatives in European countries and to begin negotiations with the Portuguese, seeking to lease or buy Goa to provide his state with access to the sea.W. H. Morris-Jones, \\"Thirty-Six Years Later: The Mixed Legacies of Mountbatten's Transfer of Power\\", in International Affairs, vol. 59 (1983), pp. 621‚Äì628 According to the writer A. G. Noorani, Indian Prime Minister Nehru's concern was to defeat what he called Hyderabad's \\"secessionist venture\\", but he favoured talks and considered military option as a last resort. Sardar Patel of the Indian National Congress, however, took a hard line, and had no patience with talks. Accordingly, the Indian government offered Hyderabad a standstill agreement which made an assurance that the status quo would be maintained and no military action would be taken for one year. According to this agreement India would handle Hyderabad's foreign affairs, but Indian Army troops stationed in Secunderabad would be removed. In Hyderabad city there was huge demonstration by Razakars led by Syed Qasim Razvi in October 1947, against the administration's decision to sign Standstill Agreement. This demonstration in front of the houses of the Prime Minister, Nawab of Chattari, advisor, Sir Walter Monckton and Minister, Nawab Ali Nawaz Jung, the main negotiators, forced them to call off their Delhi visit to sign the agreement at that time. Hyderabad violated all clauses of the agreement: in external affairs, by carrying out intrigues with Pakistan, to which it secretly loaned 15 million pounds; in defence, by building up a large semi-private army; in communications, by interfering with the traffic at the borders and the through traffic of Indian railways. India was also accused of violating the agreement by imposing an economic blockade. It turned out that the state of Bombay was interfering with supplies to Hyderabad without the knowledge of Delhi. The Government promised to take up the matter with the provincial governments, but scholar Lucien Benichou states that it was never done. There were also delays in arms shipments to Hyderabad from India.; ; According to Taylor C. Sherman, \\"India claimed that the government of Hyderabad was edging towards independence by divesting itself of its Indian securities, banning the Indian currency, halting the export of ground nuts, organising illegal gun-running from Pakistan, and inviting new recruits to its army and to its irregular forces, the Razakars.\\" The Hyderabadi envoys accused India of setting up armed barricades on all land routes and of attempting to economically isolate their nation. In the summer of 1948, Indian officials, especially Patel, signaled an intention to invade; Britain encouraged India to resolve the issue without the use of force, but refused Nizam's requests to help. The Nizam also made unsuccessful attempts to seek intervention of the United Nations. =Telangana Rebellion= In late 1945, there started a peasant uprising in Telangana area, led by communists. The communists drew their support from various quarters. Among the poor peasants, there were grievances against the jagirdari system, which covered 43% of land holding. Initially they also drew support from wealthier peasants who also fought under the communist banner, but by 1948, the coalition had disintegrated. According to the Indian intelligence Bureau Deputy Director, the social and economic programs of the communists were \\"positive and in some cases great...The communists redistributed land and livestock, reduced rates, ended forced labour and increased wages by one hundred percent. They inoculated the population and built public latrines; they encouraged women's organisations, discouraged sectarian sentiment and sought to abolish untouchability.\\" Initially, in 1945, the communists targeted zamindars and even the Hindu Deshmukhs, but soon they launched a full-fledged revolt against the Nizam. Starting mid-1946, the conflict between the Razakars and the Communists became increasingly violent, with both sides resorting to increasingly brutal methods. According to an Indian government pamphlet, the communists had killed about 2,000 people by 1948. =Communal violence before the operation= In the 1936‚Äì37 Indian elections, the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah had sought to harness Muslim aspirations, and had won the adherence of MIM leader Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung, who campaigned for an Islamic State centred on the Nizam as the Sultan dismissing all claims for democracy. The Arya Samaj, a Hindu revivalist movement, had been demanding greater access to power for the Hindu majority since the late 1930s, and was curbed by the Nizam in 1938. The Hyderabad State Congress joined forces with the Arya Samaj as well as the Hindu Mahasabha in the State. Noorani regards the MIM under Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung as explicitly committed to safeguarding the rights of religious and linguistic minorities. However, this changed with the ascent of Qasim Razvi after the Nawab's death in 1944. Even as India and Hyderabad negotiated, most of the sub-continent had been thrown into chaos as a result of communal Hindu-Muslim riots pending the imminent partition of India. Fearing a Hindu civil uprising in his own kingdom, the Nizam allowed Razvi to set up a voluntary militia of Muslims called the 'Razakars'. The Razakars ‚Äì who numbered up to 200,000 at the height of the conflict ‚Äì swore to uphold Islamic domination in Hyderabad and the Deccan plateau in the face of growing public opinion amongst the majority Hindu population favouring the accession of Hyderabad into the Indian Union. According to an account by Mohammed Hyder, a civil servant in Osmanabad district, a variety of armed militant groups, including Razakars and Deendars and ethnic militias of Pathans and Arabs claimed to be defending the Islamic faith and made claims on the land. \\"From the beginning of 1948 the Razakars had extended their activities from Hyderabad city into the towns and rural areas, murdering Hindus, abducting women, pillaging houses and fields, and looting non-Muslim property in a widespread reign of terror.\\"By Frank Moraes, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mumbai: Jaico.2007, p.394Kate, P. V., Marathwada Under the Nizams, 1724‚Äì1948, Delhi: Mittal Publications, 1987, p.84 \\"Some women became victims of rape and kidnapping by Razakars. Thousands went to jail and braved the cruelties perpetuated by the oppressive administration. Due to the activities of the Razakars, thousands of Hindus had to flee from the state and take shelter in various camps\\".Kate, P. V., Marathwada Under the Nizams, 1724-1948, Delhi: Mittal Publications, 1987, p.84 Precise numbers are not known, but 40,000 refugees have been received by the Central Provinces. This led to terrorizing of the Hindu community, some of whom went across the border into independent India and organized raids into Nizam's territory, which further escalated the violence. Many of these raiders were controlled by the Congress leadership in India and had links with extremist religious elements in the Hindutva fold. In all, more than 150 villages (of which 70 were in Indian territory outside Hyderabad State) were pushed into violence. Hyder mediated some efforts to minimize the influence of the Razakars. Razvi, while generally receptive, vetoed the option of disarming them, saying that with the Hyderabad state army ineffective, the Razakars were the only means of self-defence available. By the end of August 1948, a full blown invasion by India was imminent. Nehru was reluctant to invade, fearing a military response by Pakistan. India was unaware that Pakistan had no plans to use arms in Hyderabad, unlike Kashmir where it had admitted its troops were present. Time magazine pointed out that if India invaded Hyderabad, the Razakars would massacre Hindus, which would lead to retaliatory massacres of Muslims across India. =Hyderabadi military preparations= The Nizam was in a weak position as his army numbered only 24,000 men, of whom only some 6,000 were fully trained and equipped. These included Arabs, Rohillas, North Indian Muslims and Pathans. The State Army consisted of three armoured regiments, a horse cavalry regiment, 11 infantry battalions and artillery. These were supplemented by irregular units with horse cavalry, four infantry battalions (termed as the Saraf-e-khas, paigah, Arab and Refugee) and a garrison battalion. This army was commanded by Major General El Edroos, an Arab. 55 per cent of the Hyderabadi army was composed of Muslims, with 1,268 Muslims in a total of 1,765 officers as of 1941. In addition to these, there were about 200,000 irregular militia called the Razakars under the command of civilian leader Kasim Razvi. A quarter of these were armed with modern small firearms, while the rest were predominantly armed with muzzle-loaders and swords. =Skirmish at Kodad= On 6 September an Indian police post near Chillakallu village came under heavy fire from Razakar units. The Indian Army command sent a squadron of The Poona Horse led by Abhey Singh and a company of 2/5 Gurkha Rifles to investigate who were also fired upon by the Razakars. The tanks of the Poona Horse then chased the Razakars to Kodad, in Hyderabad territory. Here they were opposed by the armoured cars of 1 Hyderabad Lancers. In a brief action the Poona Horse destroyed one armoured car and forced the surrender of the state garrison at Kodad. =Indian military preparations= On receiving directions from the government to seize and annex Hyderabad, the Indian army came up with the Goddard Plan (laid out by Lt. Gen. E. N. Goddard, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Command). The plan envisaged two main thrusts ‚Äì from Vijayawada in the East and Solapur in the West ‚Äì while smaller units pinned down the Hyderabadi army along the border. Overall command was placed in the hands of Lt. Gen. Rajendrasinghji, DSO. The attack from Solapur was led by Major General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri and was composed of four task forces: # Strike Force comprising a mix of fast moving infantry, cavalry and light artillery, # Smash Force consisting of predominantly armoured units and artillery, # Kill Force composed of infantry and engineering units # Vir Force which comprised infantry, anti-tank and engineering units. The attack from Vijayawada was led by Major General Ajit Rudra and comprised the 2/5 Gurkha Rifles, one squadron of the 17th (Poona) Horse, and a troop from the 19th Field Battery along with engineering and ancillary units. In addition, four infantry battalions were to neutralize and protect lines of communication. Two squadrons of Hawker Tempest aircraft were prepared for air support from the Pune base. The date for the attack was fixed as 13 September, even though General Sir Roy Bucher, the Indian chief of staff, had objected on grounds that Hyderabad would be an additional front for the Indian army after Kashmir. Commencement of hostilities Indian Army movements during the Operation Polo =Day 1, 13 September= Indian forces entered the state at 4 a.m. The first battle was fought at Naldurg Fort on the Solapur Secundarabad Highway between a defending force of the 1st Hyderabad Infantry and the attacking force of the 7th Brigade. Using speed and surprise, the 7th Brigade managed to secure a vital bridge on the Bori river intact, following which an assault was made on the Hyderabadi positions at Naldurg by the 2nd Sikh Infantry. The bridge and road secured, an armoured column of the 1st Armoured Brigade ‚Äì part of the Smash force ‚Äì moved into the town of Jalkot, 8 km from Naldurg, at 0900 hours, paving the way for the Strike Force units under Lt. Col Ram Singh Commandant of 9 Dogra (a motorised battalion) to pass through. This armoured column reached the town of Umarge, 61 km inside Hyderabad by 1515 hours, where it quickly overpowered resistance from Razakar units defending the town. Meanwhile, another column consisting of a squadron of 3rd Cavalry, a troop from 18th King Edward's Own Cavalry, a troop from 9 Para Field Regiment, 10 Field Company Engineers, 3/2 Punjab Regiment, 2/1 Gurkha Rifles, 1 Mewar Infantry, and ancillary units attacked the town of Tuljapur, about 34 km north-west of Naldurg. They reached Tuljapur at dawn, where they encountered resistance from a unit of the 1st Hyderabad Infantry and about 200 Razakars who fought for two hours before surrendering. Further advance towards the town of Lohara was stalled as the river had swollen. The first day on the Western front ended with the Indians inflicting heavy casualties on the Hyderabadis and capturing large tracts of territory. Amongst the captured defenders was a British mercenary who had been tasked with blowing up the bridge near Naldurg. In the East, forces led by Lt. Gen A.A. Rudra met with fierce resistance from two armoured car cavalry units of the Hyderabad State Forces. equipped with Humber armoured cars and Staghounds, namely the 2nd and 4th Hyderabad Lancers, but managed to reach the town of Kodar by 0830 hours. Pressing on, the force reached Mungala by the afternoon. There were further incidents in Hospet ‚Äì where the 1st Mysore assaulted and secured a sugar factory from units of Razakars and Pathans ‚Äì and at Tungabhadra ‚Äì where the 5/5 Gurkha attacked and secured a vital bridge from the Hyderabadi army. =Day 2, 14 September= The force that had camped at Umarge proceeded to the town of Rajeshwar, 48 km east. As aerial reconnaissance had shown well entrenched ambush positions set up along the way, the air strikes from squadrons of Tempests were called in. These air strikes effectively cleared the route and allowed the land forces to reach and secure Rajeshwar by the afternoon. The Assault force from the East was meanwhile slowed by an anti-tank ditch and later came under heavy fire from hillside positions of the 1st Lancers and 5th Infantry 6 km from Suryapet. The positions were assaulted by the 2/5 Gurkha ‚Äì veterans of the Burma Campaign ‚Äì and was neutralised with the Hyderabadis taking severe casualties. At the same time, the 3/11 Gurkha Rifles and a squadron of 8th Cavalry attacked Osmanabad and took the town after heavy street combat with the Razakars who determinedly resisted the Indians. A force under the command of Maj. Gen. D.S. Brar was tasked with capturing the city of Aurangabad. The city was attacked by six columns of infantry and cavalry, resulting in the civil administration emerging in the afternoon and offering a surrender to the Indians. There were further incidents in Jalna where 3 Sikh, a company of 2 Jodhpur infantry and some tanks from 18 Cavalry faced stubborn resistance from Hyderabadi forces. =Day 3, 15 September= Leaving a company of 3/11 Gurkhas to occupy the town of Jalna, the remainder of the force moved to Latur, and later to Mominabad where they faced action against the 3 Golconda Lancers who gave token resistance before surrendering. At the town of Surriapet, air strikes cleared most of the Hyderabadi defences, although some Razakar units still gave resistance to the 2/5 Gurkhas who occupied the town. The retreating Hyderabadi forces destroyed the bridge at Musi to delay the Indians but failed to offer covering fire, allowing the bridge to be quickly repaired. Another incident occurred at Narkatpalli where a Razakar unit was decimated by the Indians. =Day 4, 16 September= The task force under Lt. Col. Ram Singh moved towards Zahirabad at dawn, but was slowed by a minefield, which had to be cleared. On reaching the junction of the Bidar road with the Solapur-Hyderabad City Highway, the forces encountered gunfire from ambush positions. However, leaving some of the units to handle the ambush, the bulk of the force moved on to reach 15 kilometres beyond Zahirabad by nightfall in spite of sporadic resistance along the way. Most of the resistance was from Razakar units who ambushed the Indians as they passed through urban areas. The Razakars were able to use the terrain to their advantage until the Indians brought in their 75 mm guns. =Day 5, 17 September= In the early hours of 17 September, the Indian army entered Bidar. Meanwhile, forces led by the 1st Armoured regiment were at the town of Chityal about 60 km from Hyderabad, while another column took over the town of Hingoli. By the morning of the 5th day of hostilities, it had become clear that the Hyderabad army and the Razakars had been routed on all fronts and with extremely heavy casualties. At 5 pm on 17 September, the Nizam announced a ceasefire, thus ending the armed action. Capitulation and surrender =Consultations with Indian envoy= On 16 September, faced with imminent defeat, Nizam Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan summoned his Prime Minister, Mir Laiq Ali, and requested his resignation by the morning of the following day. The resignation was delivered along with the resignations of the entire cabinet. On the noon of 17 September, a messenger brought a personal note from the Nizam to India's Agent General to Hyderabad, K.M. Munshi, summoning him to the Nizam's office at 1600 hours. At the meeting, the Nizam stated \\"The vultures have resigned. I don't know what to do\\". Munshi advised the Nizam to secure the safety of the citizens of Hyderabad by issuing appropriate orders to the Commander of the Hyderabad State Army, Major-General El Edroos. This was immediately done. =Radio broadcast after surrender by the Nizam= Major General Syed Ahmed El Edroos (at right) offers his surrender of the Hyderabad State Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri at Secunderabad It was Nizam Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan's first visit to the radio station. The Nizam of Hyderabad, in his radio speech on 23 September 1948, said \\"In November last [1947], a small group which had organized a quasi-military organization surrounded the homes of my Prime Minister, the Nawab of Chhatari, in whose wisdom I had complete confidence, and of Sir Walter Monkton, my constitutional Adviser, by duress compelled the Nawab and other trusted ministers to resign and forced the Laik Ali Ministry on me. This group headed by Kasim Razvi had no stake in the country or any record of service behind it. By methods reminiscent of Hitlerite Germany it took possession of the State, spread terror ... and rendered me completely helpless.\\" =The surrender ceremony= According to the records maintained by the Indian Army, General Chaudhari led an armoured column into Hyderabad at around 4 p.m. on 18 September and the Hyderabad army, led by Major General El Edroos, surrendered.  Communal violence during and after the operation  There were reports of looting, mass murder and rape of Muslims in reprisals by Hyderabadi Hindus. Jawaharlal Nehru appointed a mixed- faith committee led by Pandit Sunder Lal to investigate the situation. The findings of the report (Pandit Sunderlal Committee Report) were not made public until 2013 when it was accessed from the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Lessons-to-learn-from- Hyderabads-past/articleshow/27390337.cms The Committee concluded that while Muslim villagers were disarmed by the Indian Army, Hindus were often left with their weapons. The violence was carried out by Hindu residents, with the army sometimes indifferent, and sometimes participating in the atrocities. The Committee stated that large-scale violence against Muslims occurred in Marathwada and Telangana areas. It also concluded: \\"At a number of places members of the armed forces brought out Muslim adult males from villages and towns and massacred them in cold blood.\\" The Committee generally credited the military officers with good conduct but stated that soldiers acted out of bigotry. The official \\"very conservative estimate\\" was that 27,000 to 40,000 died \\"during and after the police action.\\" Other scholars have put the figure at 200,000, or even higher. Among Muslims some estimates were even higher and Smith says that the military government's private low estimates [of Muslim casualties] were at least ten times the number of murders with which the Razakars were officially accused. In William Dalrymple's words the scale of the killing was horrific. Although Nehru played down this violence, he was privately alarmed at the scale of anti-Muslim violence. Patel reacted angrily to the report and disowned its conclusions. He stated that the terms of reference were flawed because they only covered the part during and after the operation. He also cast aspersions on the motives and standing of the committee. These objections are regarded by Noorani as disingenuous because the commission was an official one, and it was critical of the Razakars as well. According to Mohammed Hyder, the tragic consequences of the Indian operation were largely preventable. He faulted the Indian army with neither restoring local administration, nor setting up their own military administration. As a result, the anarchy led to several thousand \\"thugs\\", from the camps set up across the border, filling the vacuum. He stated \\"Thousands of families were broken up, children separated from their parents and wives, from their husbands. Women and girls were hunted down and raped.\\" The Committee Report mentions mass rape of Muslim women by Indian troops. According to the communist leader Puccalapalli Sundarayya, Hindus in villages rescued thousands of Muslim families from the Union Army's campaign of rape and murder.  Hyderabad after integration  = Detentions and release of people involved = Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Nizam Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan, and Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri after Hyderabad's accession to the Dominion of India. The Indian military detained thousands of people during the operation, including Razakars, Hindu militants, and communists. This was largely done on the basis of local informants, who used this opportunity to settle scores. The estimated number of people detained was close to 18,000, which resulted in overcrowded jails and a paralyzed criminal system. The Indian government set up Special Tribunals to prosecute these. These strongly resembled the colonial governments earlier, and there were many legal irregularities, including denial or inability to access lawyers and delayed trials - about which the Red Cross was pressuring Nehru. The viewpoint of the government was: \\"in political physics, Razakar action and Hindu reaction have been almost equal and opposite.\\" A quiet decision was taken to release all Hindus and for a review of all Muslim cases, aiming to let many of them out. Regarding atrocities by Muslims, Nehru was sympathetic to Hyderabadi culture, and considered the actions during the operation as \\"madness\\" seizing \\"decent people\\", analogous to experience elsewhere during the partition of India. Nehru was also concerned that disenfranchised Muslims would join the communists. Patel opposed this viewpoint, treating the penal action as restoring law and order, and signaling that there was no partiality towards Muslims. The government was under pressure to not prosecute participants in communal violence, which often made communal relations worse. Patel had also died in 1950. Thus, by 1953 the Indian government released all but a few persons. = Overhaul of bureaucracy = The question of Hindu-Muslim balance in the bureaucracy was a sensitive one. Muslims had predominated in the executive, police and administrative services. Before the invasion, the Indian Cabinet, with Nehru's leadership, decided that there would be as few changes as possible. However, Patel, who had a differences of opinion with Nehru, ran his Ministry with little consultation with the Indian Cabinet. The initial plans were not followed after the invasion, partly due to different ideas at various levels of administration. Over a hundred officers were dismissed on an ethnic basis, from all levels, and many local officers were detained for their role in the violence. This pattern was seen in new hirings as well. Junior officers from neighbouring Bombay, CP and Madras regions were appointed to replace the vacancies. They were unable to speak the language and were unfamiliar with local conditions. Nehru objected to this \\"communal chauvinism\\" and called them \\"incompetent outsiders\\", and tried to impose Hyderabadi residency requirements: however, this was circumvented by using forged documents.

(August 12, 1832 - May 23, 1881) He was the co-founder of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 1852 at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Education William graduated from Jefferson College (now Washington and Jefferson College) and then went on to receive his M.D. from Jefferson Medical College in 1856, where he was president of his graduating class. Family His father was the physician to the town of Canonsburg and died early in William's life. He is the younger brother of Jonathan K. Letterman who is known as the Father of Battlefield Medicine. His system enabled thousands of wounded men to be recovered and treated during the American Civil War.  Phi Kappa Psi  William and his mother were living just a few houses away from Jefferson College. In the winter of 1850-1851, a typhoid fever epidemic broke out in the area and William and his friend, Charles Page Thomas Moore, spent long nights caring for a sick friend. Letterman and Moore grew to appreciate their service, and decided to form an organization that would ensconce these ideals. On the night of February 19, 1852, the brotherhood of Phi Kappa Psi was born.  Freemason  On January 17, 1868, William received his Freemasons (Masons) apprentice degree from Concordia Lodge #13 in Baltimore, Maryland. He also helped to organize the Masonic Lodge, in Duffau, Texas.  Life and Death  Letterman's home in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. In the late fall of 1875, William Henry Letterman went to Prairie Home, Missouri, because of continued poor health and remained there for about three years. Then he decided the climate in Texas would be advantageous, so in the spring of 1878 he made a two month tour to that state. In November, 1878, with his wife and baby daughter, Laura, he left Missouri for Dallas, Texas, and then went to Stephenville, Texas by stage coach. He stopped at the Texas Hotel and the following day he hired a carriage and arrived at Duffau, Erath County, that afternoon. At Duffau there were some mineral wells, and he had been told that the railroad would be built through Duffau, westward. However, the railroad was constructed through Hico and Stephenville. When he went to Texas, he carried letters of introduction signed by many prominent men of the East. He helped organize a county medical association and also a district medical association in Stephenville, and he was elected the first president. He was a member of the Northwest Texas Medical and Surgical Society. He was examined and given a certificate to practice by M. S. Crow, M.D., chairman of the board of medical examiners, Erath County, Texas, and this was recorded on the twenty-seventh of November, 1878, at the office in Stephenville by W. H. Fooshea. His health grew worse, and he was advised to make a trip to the Gulf. In a covered wagon, with his brother Ritchie as driver and with his wife and two children riding nearby in a buggy, he set out from Duffau on May 15, 1881. Because he grew worse daily, all were compelled to return within a week. Before he turned back, he stayed for a short while at the home of a friend in what is now downtown Austin. The historical site is presently part of 6th street's bar district. While the upstairs loft where Letterman spent his last days has held many merchants during the last century, it is currently a bar named Peckerheads. A small shrine in Letterman's honor exists there today. He died on May 23, 1881, and was buried in the cemetery at Duffau. The Revered Mrs. Hugart conducted services at the church, and Mr. Franks conducted the Masonic service. Mrs. Letterman sold a riding pony, which her husband had given her, and had a monument placed at his grave. This monument still stands. Shortly after Dr. Letterman‚Äôs death, his widow and children returned to the home of Mrs. Letterman‚Äôs father, Professor Slaughter, in Missouri. The last lines Dr. Letterman wrote were these: Dear Sir (Prof. Slaughter) Today I am used up right sharp‚Äîdoes not express my case too strong. At all events after careful advice, I leave tomorrow, closing the housing and go direct to the Gulf at the mouth of Rio Grande del Norte. This is 400 miles from here. We go through Lampas, thence to Austin, then to the mouth of River, then we rest for 2 or 3 weeks rolling in salt water, then we make a bee line for San Antonio, Laredo, and return home if well. If not well, keep agoing. I will close. Your next, if this is answered, you will direct to Austin. Good-by.\\" Love to all, W. H.

Thomas Hickey's death The circumstances surrounding Thomas \\"T.J.\\" Hickey's death are disputed. On the morning of Saturday 14 February 2004, the 17-year-old Aboriginal Australian boy was riding his bicycle downhill while a police vehicle was patrolling the nearby area. According to New South Wales Police, he collided with a protruding gutter and was flung into the air and impaled on a high fence outside a block of units off Phillip Street, Waterloo, causing penetrating injuries of the neck and chest. Police officers at the scene administered first aid until New South Wales Ambulance officers arrived. Hickey died with his family by his side early on 15 February 2004. A large proportion of the inquest centered on whether police were \\"pursuing\\" Hickey, or \\"following\\" him. At the conclusion of the coronial inquest, NSW Police Commissioner Ken Moroney was interviewed on ABC Radio and gave this explanation of the distinction: \\"I think if you were to ask the person on the street the definition between, and not a Concise Oxford Dictionary definition, but if you were to ask somebody their interpretation of being followed and being pursued I think they are two distinct and clear actions. Being followed, I think, in the ordinary layman's mind, creates a particular picture. Being pursued by police creates a completely different picture and clearly there was no evidence that Mr Hickey was being pursued in the normal definition of that word\\". Moroney supported the driver of the police truck, Senior Constable Michael Hollingsworth, in his refusal to give evidence. Both maintained this was a \\"normal civilian right\\".Freedom Socialist Bulletin, by Ray Jackson: ABC Radio PM Tuesday 17 August According to police, they arrived at the scene quickly with Constables Hollingsworth and Reynolds arriving a few minutes after the first police vehicle. Thomas was hanging by his shirt and was not seen to be impaled but in a serious condition. Police immediately rendered first aid and were unable to save him as \\"the injury was probably non-survivable\\".Abernethy, J: Report by the NSW State Coroner into deaths in custody/police operations 2004, page 71. . At no time was Police Rescue or NSW Ambulance called off from attending. Evidence exists of Hollingsworth making numerous calls for the ETA of ambulance paramedics. When ambulance officers arrived, Hollingsworth and Reynolds Helped move Thomas into the Ambulance. A female cousin of Hickey made herself known to Hollingsworth and accompanied both Hollingsworth and Reynolds in the police truck when they left the scene, escorting the ambulance to the Children's Hospital at Randwick . Upon arrival at the hospital, Hollingsworth and Reynolds waited at the accident and emergency department. Some time later Hollingsworth and Reynolds, still at the hospital waiting for TJ's family, were ordered away by a hospital social worker, possibly because Hollingsworth was covered in blood and might have upset the family and members of the public. There was an outstanding arrest warrant in his name, but police have consistently maintained that the patrol car was searching for a different individual, wanted in connection with a violent bag snatch at Redfern railway station earlier the same day. The Hickey family and supporters dispute this version of events, claiming that witnesses saw Hickey's bike clipped by the police car, thus propelling him onto the fence. This claim was not supported by the testimony of two Aboriginal Liaison Officers to a NSW Parliamentary Inquiry into the death, though neither of the officers were present at the scene. (One of the officers was later convicted of murder and arson, an act for which he had blamed police.) Despite calls to re-open the coronial inquest, the New South Wales government has refused to do so. Appeal to the United Nations Human rights commission to investigate the death was declined and no evidence of racial motivation was discovered (https://www.ag.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-03/HickeyvAustralia- Viewsof21July2014.pdf). Riots On the evening of 15 February, Aboriginal and non-Indigenous youths and adults, most of them from The Block, the Waterloo estate and other inner city housing precincts gathered at Eveleigh Street quickly after the word of the death spread. Persons were seen preparing petrol bombs and stockpiling bricks, resulting in police closing the Eveleigh Street entrance to the station, which turned the crowd violent and they began to throw bottles, bricks, live fireworks and Molotov cocktails. The violence escalated into a full-scale riot around the Block, during which Redfern railway station was briefly alight, suffering superficial damage. The riot continued into the early morning, until police used fire brigade water hoses to disperse the crowd. Total damages included a torched car and 40 injured police officers. Injuries among police officers were increased due to the removal of riot gear from NSW Police vehicles in the city area, resulting in Workcover fining the NSW Police $100,000.{https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw- police-fined-100-000-over-redfern-riot-20070608-gdqc3r.html} Post-riot A memorial service was held on 19 February 2004 in Redfern, and in Walgett, New South Wales (Hickey's hometown), on 22 February 2004. In 2005, the University of Technology Sydney's students' association donated a plaque with TJ's portrait, with an inscription that read: \\"On the 14th February, 2004, TJ Hickey, aged 17, was impaled upon the metal fence above, arising from a police pursuit. The young man died as a result of his wounds the next day. In our hearts you will stay TJ.\\" Local police, the NSW government and the Department of Housing have refused to allow the plaque to be placed on the wall below the fence where Hickey was impaled unless the words \\"police pursuit\\" were changed to \\"tragic accident\\", which the family has refused to do. Hickey's parents, Gail and Ian Hickey, divorced in late 2006. Hickey supporters claim that police have continued to harass the family, including the arrest of several family members and friends on 4 September 2010. Senior Constable Michael Hollingsworth was again promoted and awarded the National Police Medal and Diligent and Ethical Service Medal. Senior Constable Hollingsworth arrested and charged Joey Hickey (uncle of TJ) for an armed robbery at the National Australia Bank in Wollongong late 2001 - Hickey was convicted. He also arrested, charged and applied for an apprehended violence order against Lyall Munro for domestic assault against his Aboriginal wife. Munro is an active protester seeking to have the Coroner's inquest reopened. Senior Constable Hollingsworth served 11 years at Redfern Police. Former Plain Clothes Sergeant Michael Hollingsworth died from cancer on 28 October 2018. Legacy The 2013 film Around the Block focuses partly on the riots.

Actions are typically adjudicated on the spot by a referee, though variants exist whereby players jointly mediate their own actions. Theatre-style LARP The most common form of freeform game is the Theatre-style live action role-playing game (LARP). Such freeforms have sprung up around the world independently. Some sources suggest the genre originated in Australia where the first large-scale (100 player) freeform was played at the CanCon gaming convention in Canberra in January 1983, quickly spreading to Melbourne and later Sydney gaming conventions.Anonymous: Free Form Role-Playing, in: Arcanacon 1983, p. 10 Others suggest Iceland, or to games played at the University of York and popularised in the fanzine Aslan in the late nineteen eighties. Freeforms are particularly popular in Australia, where rules-based LARP games have only become common during the last decade. Some Australian conventions run specific tournaments for small-scale freeforms that challenge the players or the normal conventions of roleplaying in ways not possible with other types of games. Such freeforms may experiment with different narrative styles, contemporary social issues or unusual themes, and can be very realistic. Such games are often restricted to mature players. \\"Multiform\\" or \\"systemless\\" styles of gaming are theatrical hybrids of traditional and freeform role-playing which may also incorporate elements of LARP. They typically emphasise theatrical expression and close emotional identification with the characters portrayed. In a multiform game, players sit at the table for social or strategic roleplaying and may even use standard tabletop rules, but will stand to act out more physical aspects of the game, often without use of formal rules sets. This style of gaming is frequently used at Australian conventions and many tabletop games employ it without being specifically labelled as multiforms, though it is not often used in home games. Freeform computer-assisted gaming \\"Freeform\\" can also refer to online text-based role-playing games which lack rules or contain only basic guidelines, relying instead on the player's acting abilities and commitment to a good story. (In MUSH or IRC settings, these are often called consent-based, because what happens to a character is influenced by a potential \\"veto\\" from that character's player.) These systems must either rely on carefully selected individuals or strict moderation, in order to prevent less mature players from taking advantage (god-moding) of the rule-free environment, for example by unrealistically shielding their characters from the consequences of their actions. Similarly, \\"freeform\\" can refer to online forum-. and email-based role-playing games which lack rules or which lack statistics by which to judge a character's abilities. As with freeform MUSHes and IRC games those running the game rely instead upon the players' writing talents and use of description to determine outcomes--if a GM is used to control the game at all. Some online freeform games closely resemble collaborative fiction, while others have much more structured rule sets, such as the Role Player's Creed.

Description  Basking Gal√°pagos fur seals are the smallest otariids. They are born with a black natal coat that they molt to reveal a lighter brown coat before becoming adults. Gal√°pagos fur seals display sexual dimorphism. The males are up to 2x heavier than the females and 1‚Äì1.3 times longer. Males grow to be 1.5 m (5 feet) on average and weigh about 64 kg (140 lb). Females grow to be 1.25 m on average and weigh 27 kg (60 lb).  Range and habitat  The Gal√°pagos fur seal is endemic to the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, South America. It is present on nearly all the islands of the Galapagos. It is classified as a non- migrant species. However, recent research has documented the presence of Gal√°pagos fur seals in Mexico and Guatemala.  Reproduction  Gal√°pagos fur seals live in large colonies on the rocky beaches of the Gal√°pagos Islands. These colonies are then divided into territories by the male seals during breeding season, which is mid-August to mid-November, with a peak in late September and early October. Each successful reproductive female will choose a territory on the beach to pup on. =Maternal care= Gal√°pagos fur seals have the lowest reproductive rate reported in seals, and it takes an unusually long time to raise seal pups to independence. Females bear only one pup at a time, and she remains with her newborn for a week before leaving to feed. She then periodically returns to the pup and stays to suckle it for a few days before leaving on another hunting trip. Females recognize their own pups by smell and sound, and pups also learn to identify their mothers by the females‚Äô \\"pup attraction calls\\". Mother-pup recognition is crucial because females exclusively nurse their own pups, often violently rejecting strange pups that approach. Orphaned seal pups usually try to sneak up on sleeping or calling females to suckle, but stealing milk is not enough to sustain the pups, and they usually die within a month. =Interbrood conflict= Fur seal pups rely on their mother's milk for the first eighteen months, and weaning may be delayed for up to two or three years if conditions are poor. The result is that every year up to 23% of pups are born when an older sibling is still suckling. Survival of the younger sibling greatly depends on the availability of resources. In years when there is abundant food, the mortality rate of second pups is as low as 5%, which is equivalent to the mortality rate of pups without siblings. In years when food is scarce, 80% of pups with suckling older siblings die within a month. The younger sibling thus serves as an insurance in case the first sibling dies, and also provides extra reproductive value in case conditions prove better than expected. Such a bet-hedging strategy is particularly useful in Galapagos fur seals, since there is a great deal of maternal investment in raising a seal pup to independence in an environment that has great fluctuations in food. The high level of resource uncertainty, late weaning, and potential overlap time of suckling young all lead to violent sibling rivalry and provide a good environment for studying parent-offspring conflict. From an offspring's point of view, it would be most beneficial to continue suckling and receive more than its fair share of milk, but to the mother seal, it would pay to wean the older, more independent offspring in order to invest in the next pup. Thus, studies show that 75% of mothers intervened, often aggressively, when the older sibling harassed the newborn pups. Mothers would bite or lift the older offspring roughly by its skin, which sometimes caused open wounds. Maternal aggression towards the older sibling diminishes with time after the second sibling's birth. Even without direct aggression, older siblings may still indirectly harm their younger siblings by outcompeting them for milk. The older offspring usually suckles first and allows their younger sibling access to the mother only after it is satiated, resulting in very little milk left over for the younger pup. Thus, the younger siblings often die from starvation. During periods when there is very little prey, interbrood conflict increases. Gal√°pagos fur seal population is drastically affected by El Ni√±o, a period accompanied by high water temperatures and a deepening thermocline. Food becomes scarce during El Ni√±o, and thus older seals exhibit an intense aversion to weaning, causing the mother seal to neglect the younger sibling. Male Competition Males will compete for the females when they become large enough by establishing territories on the beaches. The beaches are valuable pupping substrate for females. They have territories that average 200 m2. This is large compared to amount of territory occupied by most otariid males.  Feeding and predation  The Gal√°pagos fur seal feeds primarily on fish, squid and shellfish. They feed relatively close to shore and near the surface, but have been seen at depths of . They primarily feed at night because their prey is much easier to catch then. During normal years, food is relatively plentiful. However, during an El Ni√±o year, there can be fierce competition for food, and many young pups die during these years. The adult seals feed themselves before their young and during particularly rough El Ni√±o years, most of the young seal populations will die. The Gal√°pagos fur seal has virtually no constant predators. Occasionally, sharks and orcas have been seen feeding on the seals, but this is very rare. Sharks and orcas are the main predator of most other seal species, but their migration paths do not usually pass the Gal√°pagos.  Conservation  Threats The threat of hunting has been removed since the declaration of the Gal√°pagos islands as a national park and the protection of the species under law. However, the seals‚Äô habitat is naturally restricted which makes them more threatened by environmental changes. Other potential and existing threats are tourism, oil spills, and boat collisions. The Gal√°pagos Islands are heavily trafficked by tourists. However, tourism is well regulated and restricted by the Ecuadorian government. Collisions with boats which frequent the waters near the islands could also be fatal to the Galapagos fur seals. Oil spills would be particularly damaging to the fur seal as their thick pelage is an important part of their thermoregulation. The waters near the archipelago are trafficked by vessels of ranging sizes that could contain and release moderate amounts of oil. Historically the Gal√°pagos fur seal has also been threatened by hunting and invasive species. Whalers and sealers used to hunt the seals for their fur. But the seals are now protected by Ecuadorian law as is most of their habitat. Isabela Island was documented as having a population of dogs that were known to kill the Gal√°pagos fur seals. Since then all of the feral dog population on Isabela Island has been exterminated and the seals no longer face this threat. Gal√°pagos fur seals have had a declining population since the 19th century. Thousands of these seals were killed for their fur in the 1800s by poachers. Starting in 1959, Ecuador established strict laws to protect these animals. The government of Ecuador declared the Gal√°pagos Islands a national park, and since then no major poaching has occurred. Despite the laws, another tragic blow to their population occurred during the 1982‚Äì1983 El Ni√±o weather event. Almost all of the seal pups died, and about 30% of the adult population was wiped out. Since 1983 no major calamity has occurred to decrease their population significantly.

Early life in New York and Michigan Winans was born in Avon, New York, and moved with his parents, John and Eliza (n√©e Way), to Michigan in 1834. The family first moved to Scio Township in Washtenaw County and in spring 1836 moved to Unadilla Township in Livingston County. His father died in the fall of 1843, and Winans moved with his mother to Hamburg Township, also in Livingston County. His mother died in July, 1852 and Winans worked for four years in a wool carding mill. At the age of twenty, he attended Albion College, Albion, Michigan, for two and a half years in preparation for entering the Law School of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. California Gold Rush Before completing his studies, Winans was drawn by news of the California Gold Rush, and in March 1850 left for California by an overland route to seek his fortune. Arriving July 20, he engaged in mining first on the north branch of the American River near Placerville. He continued the same work with some varied success in different parts of the state. In 1853, he was one of the members of the celebrated Randolph Hill Mining Company in the town of Rough and Ready (now a town west of Grass Valley in Nevada County). In 1855, he returned to Michigan to marry Elizabeth Galloway and then returned to California, where he continued with the company until its dissolution in 1857. He was a principal stockholder in the Rough and Ready Ditch Company and also engaged in banking in Rough and Ready. Politics in Michigan He returned to Michigan in 1858 and purchased a 400-acre (1.6 km2) farm in Hamburg Township, Michigan, where he and his wife would have two sons, Edwin, Jr. and George. He was twice elected a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives 1861‚Äì1865 and was a delegate to the state constitutional convention of May 15, 1867. He was a Hamburg Township supervisor, 1872‚Äì1873 and probate judge of Livingston County 1877‚Äì1881. Winans was elected as a Fusion candidate and seated with the Democrats in the United States House of Representatives for the Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1887. He resumed agricultural pursuits in Livingston County and served as Governor of Michigan 1891‚Äì1893. He was the first Democrat elected governor after the American Civil War (Josiah Begole had been elected in 1882 on a Fusionist ticket combining the Greenback and Democratic Parties). During his tenure, several election reform bills were sanctioned, the most significant of which was the secret Australian ballot. His son, George, acted as his private secretary. Death and legacy Winans died in Hamburg, Michigan, and is interred in Hamburg Cemetery. Winans's son, also named Edwin Baruch Winans, was a major general in the United States Army and commanding general of the Third Army from September 15, 1932, to September 30, 1933. He also served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1927.

He is best known for founding the Lear Jet Corporation, a manufacturer of business jets. He also invented the battery eliminator for the B battery, and developed the 8-track cartridge, an audio tape system.Stim and Pressman 2007, p. 20. Throughout his career of 46 years, Lear received over 120 patents. Career =Radio engineer= Lear was self-taught: \\"He had read widely on wireless, including the works of Nikola Tesla, the scientist/inventor. He had even built a radio set, based on a twenty-five-cent Galena crystal which he sent away for, and he had learned the Morse code, the fun ending with the ban on radio during World War I.\\" One of his first ventures was with Lawrence Sorensen, selling loose radio couplers. Lear had been an \\"instructor in wireless\\" in the U.S. Navy so he confidently identified himself as a radio engineer to Clifford Reid in Quincy, Illinois. Reid was selling auto supplies and hired Lear to expand into radio. With contractor Julius Bergen, he founded Quincy Radio Labs and built speaker boxes for radios. Lear also helped develop WLAL which evolved into the powerful station KVOO. Lear's talents as engineer showed in 1924 when he moved to Chicago and built a B-battery eliminator for the Universal Battery Company with R. D. Morey. Then he met Waldorf Astoria Smith of the Carter Radio Company who helped him with radio theory including Ohm's law. Tom Fletcher of the QRS Company was so impressed by Lear's radio set designed around a QRS rectifier tube that he hired him, offering 60% more pay than Universal Battery. Bill Grunow of the Grigsby-Grunow-Hinds Company topped that offer when Lear fixed the problem with 60,000 B-battery eliminators that they had manufactured. Lear also came up with an invention in 1924 when power inverters installed at Stevens Hotel failed to perform for the Radio Manufacturers' Association. Lear built audio amplifiers and cases for the Magnavox speakers then coming out. The Magnavox \\"majestic dynamic speakers\\" that he produced with Grunow were very popular. With Ernie Tyrman he built and sold radio sets, using methods patented by others, which they had not licensed. Anxious over prosecution for patent infringement, they both developed ulcers. Tyrman died after surgery; consequently, Lear changed his diet. Lear Radio Laboratories was the source of an early step to miniaturization in electronics. Tuning coils in the radio frequency stage of a set were rather large and Lear knew how to reduce their size by using Litz wire. Wire braided from many fine strands has a large surface area giving it high conductivity at radio frequency. Lear borrowed $5,000 from his friend Algot Olson to make machines to wrap the strands, braid the wire, and wind the coils. The industry was set up in the basement of his mother's old house on 65th street, and done with assistance of Don Mitchell, a railroad electrician. Lear called the company Radio Coil and Wire Corporation. They took an order of 50,000 coils from Eugene F. McDonald of Zenith Electronics when they demonstrated them. These small coils were one-quarter the size of coils with solid wire. Lear traded his Radio Coil business for a one-third interest in Paul Galvin's Galvin Manufacturing Company. At that time the radio had not yet been developed for use in automobiles, but Lear and Howard Gates of Zenith made a pair; Lear designed the circuit and layout, Gates did the metal work and Lear assembled them. When Lear presented Galvin with the prototype, it was first dismissed. Later the idea was surfaced by Galvin and a 200-unit production run was made. Galvin and Lear mulled over names for the product on a cross-country trip and came up with \\"Motorola\\" which was a blend of \\"motor\\" and the then popular suffix -ola used with audio equipment of the time (for example \\"Victrola\\"). The product was such a success that Galvin changed the name of the company to Motorola. 8-track tape =Music cartridges= Lear developed the Lear Jet Stereo 8 music cartridge in 1964, better-known as the \\"8-track\\". This was an eight track variation of the four track Muntz Stereo-Pak tape cartridge, marketed by Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz in California in 1962, itself a version of a 3-track system, Fidelipac. The 8-track was a commercial success that provided good audio quality and was easily adapted to vehicle and home use.\\"Vintage Audio History.\\" Video Interchange. Retrieved April 14, 2009. It was a solution to the need for a convenient music source for his new business jets. The consumer version of players for these tapes first appeared in September 1965. In 1966, model Ford automobiles with RCA and Lear offered the first pre-recorded Stereo 8 Music Cartridges.Cummings, Alex Sayf (2013) Democracy of Sound: Music Piracy and the Remaking of American Copyright in the Twentieth Century, page 83, Oxford University Press . =Aviation= In 1931, Lear bought his first aircraft, a Fleet biplane for $2,500 from a woman in Dearborn, Michigan. The challenges of aerial navigation led Lear into the development of radio direction finders and avionics products. Lear founded Lear Developments, a company specializing in aerospace instruments and electronics.Zhito, Lee. \\"Lear: Wizard of the Cartridge Age.\\" Billboard, Volume 17, Issue 16, April 17, 1965, p. 6. Lear developed radio direction finders, autopilots, and the first fully automatic aircraft landing system. He was awarded the Collier Trophy for this contribution in 1949.Collier Trophy awards Lear also developed and marketed a line of panel-mounted radios for general aviation. His \\"LearAvian\\" series of portable radios, which incorporated radio direction finder circuits as well as broadcast band coverage, were especially popular. The company earned about $100 million during WW II for its products. Lear changed the name of Lear Developments to Lear Incorporated and in 1949 opened a manufacturing facility in Santa Monica, California. In 1960, Lear moved to Switzerland and founded the Swiss American Aviation Company (SAAC). The company's goal was to redesign the FFA P-16 jet fighter into a small business jet, designated as SAAC 23. After two crashes during test flights of the FFA P-16, the Swiss government had cancelled its order for the aircraft and no other customers had been found.Rashke 1985, p. 219. During the short existence of SAAC, King Michael I of Romania met Bill Lear and agreed to work as a test pilot for the Swiss part of the company. This was during the forced exile of the King, that lasted for 50 years, until 1997.ASR Principele Radu al Rom√¢niei ‚Äì Ma»ôinile Regelui, Editura Curtea Veche, Bucure»ôti, 2012, Learjet 25, an example of the Lear executive jets that still bear his name In 1962, Lear sold his interest in Lear Incorporated to the Siegler Corporation after failing to persuade Lear Incorporated's board to go into the aircraft manufacturing business. The remaining company was thereafter known as Lear Siegler. Bill Lear next moved to Wichita, Kansas, to manufacture the resulting converted design as the Lear Jet. On October 7, 1963, Lear Jet started test flights on the Learjet 23, the first mass-produced business jet. The first Lear Jet was sold in 1963; it could carry eight passengers at 560 mph and cost about $650,000 fully equipped, about $400,000 less than its competitors at the time. Although the Lear Jet was quite successful and remains in production, Bill Lear was eventually forced to sell Lear Jet Corp. to the Gates Rubber Co. in 1967 due to other financial losses.AAHS \\"Folded Wings\\" obit, 3rd Quarter 1978. In 1968, Lear also started work on a closed circuit steam turbine to power cars and buses, and built a transit bus and converted a Chevrolet Monte Carlo sedan to use this turbine system. It used a proprietary working fluid dubbed Learium, possibly a chlorofluorocarbon similar to DuPont Freon.Ethridge, John (August 1972) \\"PM takes a ride in tomorrow's bus, today.\\", Popular Mechanics In the early 1970s, Lear backed the Foxjet ST600 with its first order. The Very Light Jet project failed, but the VLJ concept became popular again 30 years later.\\"Foxjet Now a Historic Lawn Ornament.\\" eaa.org. Retrieved: September 14, 2011. In 1976, Lear sold an option to his LearStar concept to Canadair, a Montreal aircraft manufacturer.Rashke 1985, p. 331. The idea was to design an executive aircraft which would bring together a supercritical wing with Lycoming's new turbofan engine. However, the concept was only a very rough outline,Rashke 1985, pp. 333‚Äì338. prepared by a consultant.Logie 1992, p. 55. Although Canadair took up its option, Lear eventually realized that the Canadians had simply been interested in using his reputation and skills at promotion, to \\"penetrate the market,\\" Canadair's design had little relation to his concept and Lear had no role in its development.Rashke 1985, p. 339. However, the Canadair Challenger business jet was to have a long career, with several variants. Bombardier Aerospace, by that time the parent company of Canadair, acquired Lear Jet in 1990. One of Lear's most innovative projects was his last ‚Äî a revolutionary aircraft called the LearAvia Lear Fan 2100, a seven-passenger aircraft whose single pusher propeller was powered by two turbine engines. The fuselage of this aircraft was made of lightweight composite materials, instead of the more typical aluminum alloys. The Lear Fan was ultimately never completed. At the time of his death he begged his wife, Moya, to finish it; with the help of investors, she attempted to do so, but the aircraft failed to obtain FAA certification and so was never put into production. Personal life Lear was born on June 26, 1902 in Hannibal, Missouri to Ruben Marion Lear, a carpenter, and Gertrude Elizabeth Powell Lear. His mother left his father and they stayed with aunt Gussie Bornhouser in Dubuque, Iowa. Later Otto Kirmse took them in and was a step-father to Bill Lear. The family relocated to Chicago where Lear attended Kershaw Grammar School. On Sundays, young Lear attended the Moody Tabernacle (now Moody Church). \\"From listening to Paul Rader, of the Moody Tabernacle, he learned grammar and how to speak. He found out how to meet people, how to shake hands, and what to say when he did so... He learned about hypocrisy, too\\" and ceased any further church affiliation.Boesen, Victor (1971) They Said It Couldn't Be Done: The Incredible Story of Bill Lear. New York: Doubleday . While in Chicago, Lear had also been employed briefly at a local air field. One summer he spent with his father in Tulsa, re-building a Model-T car. Too independent to move back with his mother in Chicago, Lear struck out cross country. He joined the U.S. Navy and was sent to Great Lakes Naval Training Station. Later after discharge, and with a young family, \\"he decided to complete his high school education. Starting a radio repair shop in his home, which he could tend nights, Lear enrolled at Tulsa Central High School, taking eight solids, heavy on the math. He was at the point of wrapping up the entire four-year curriculum in one when he was again dismissed for showing up teachers.\\" Marriages and children: * With his first wife, Ethel Peterson Lear, daughter Mary Louise was born in January 1925. * He married his second wife, Madeline Murphy, in October 1926.

The company was founded in 1980 as Stratus Computer, Inc. in Natick, Massachusetts, and adopted its present name in 1999. The current CEO and president is Dave Laurello. Stratus Technologies, Inc. is a privately held company, owned solely by Siris Capital Group. The parent company, Stratus Technologies Bermuda Holdings, Ltd., is incorporated in Bermuda. Stratus Computer was a Marlborough, Massachusetts, based producer of fault tolerant minicomputers. It competed with computers from Tandem Computers and to a lesser extent Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX. Starting in 1983, its computers were resold worldwide by Olivetti under CPS/32 brand. Then, from 1985 to 1993, its computers were resold by IBM under the IBM System/88 brand. The company is now based in Maynard, Massachusetts. History Stratus shipped its first computer in February 1982, a short 21 months after its founding. The customer was the West Lynn Creamery, located in nearby Lynn Massachusetts. This initial customer verified Stratus' strategy of competing against Tandem Computers, the company that pioneered the general purpose fault tolerant industry. The West Lynn Creamery had planned on purchasing a Tandem but switched to Stratus after learning of their product. The company's traditional markets have been financial services companies such as banks and stock exchanges. Beginning in the 1990s, the company moved into the telecommunications industry, particularly in the area of network management and custom services, with the result that its telecommunications revenues surpassed those from enterprise computing. This led to a buyout of the company by Ascend Communications in 1998 (later acquired by Lucent Technologies). The enterprise server portion of the business was of little interest to Ascend and that portion was spun off in a management buyout in 1999, with funding from international investment firm, Investcorp. The company was named Stratus Technologies, Inc. Now privately held, Stratus Technologies, Inc. is owned by Siris Capital Group which acquired the company on April 28, 2014.http://www.stratus.com/About/News/2014/Siris-and-Stratus-Close In the second quarter of 2002, Lucent sold the telecom product lines that originally came from Stratus to Platinum Equity, a buyout firm based in Los Angeles. That unit was eventually named Cemprus LLC. Stratus purchased Cemprus in 2003. It's now a wholly owned subsidiary of Stratus. This acquisition gave Stratus the SS7 signaling software for phone networks and intelligent gateway software so that traditional and IP voice equipment are able to communicate. This software can be used to support higher-level telephony applications such as calling- card and toll free phone number services. In 2006, Stratus purchased Emergent Network Solutions of Allen, Texas. Stratus sold off Emergent in 2009, and Emergent is now known as Stratus Telecommunications. The two companies are now separate entities. One is not the parent of the other. On July 16, 2010 as a reverse merger between YMax and VocalTec - all of the Stratus Telecommunications technologies are owned by VocalTec. In 2012, Stratus acquired the assets, products, services, and intellectual property of Marathon Technologies along with its customer base and channel-partner network. Products and customers Its legacy product line was originally based on Motorola MC68000 processors (FT and XA series), and then migrated to Intel i860 processors (XA/R series), then to Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC processors (Continuum series), and finally to Intel Xeon processors (V Series). That line runs the VOS operating system, which originally had many features inspired by or derived from Multics. Other operating systems supported on the legacy platforms (XA/R, Jetta / Continuum)‚ÄîHP-UX and a home-grown UNIX product called FTX (Fault-Tolerant UNIX)‚Äîare supported but no longer actively sold. In June 2002, Stratus introduced the ftServer line of Intel-based servers, running Microsoft Windows 2000 and higher. The Stratus ftServer line sold today supports Windows 2000, 2003 and 2008, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The company sells models of ftServer designated as entry-level, mid-range and enterprise-class fault tolerant servers. The mid-range and enterprise ftServer systems also run VMware vSphere virtualization software. The company began offering Stratus Avance software in June 2008, a high availability product with virtualization built in. Avance runs on two general-purpose x86 servers and allows deployment of applications across high-availability virtual machines, freeing up existing x86 servers. The two servers comprising the Avance high-availability platform may be separated by up to three miles for purposes of disaster recovery and business continuity. Avance is intended to serve small-to-medium size businesses' need for affordable and simple high availability and virtualization. Stratus has a large presence in Maynard, Massachusetts, its U.S. headquarters, and in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as several worldwide offices, in locations such as the UK, the Netherlands, South Africa, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Japan. The company has a vast customer base, but popular types of its customers include banks and credit unions, emergency response centers (such as 911 in the USA), police departments, fire departments, hospitals, clinics, governments, credit card companies, stock exchanges, telcos/phone companies and Internet providers.

He took part in the foundation, in 1832, of the Soci√©t√© Entomologique de France. Poey returned to Cuba in 1833 where he founded the Museum of Natural History in 1839. In 1842 he became the first professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Havana. He also took part in the creation of the Academy of Science (natural, physical and medical) of Havana and was a president of the anthropological Society.

They brew beer under the brand name Bofferding and since taking over in 2004 Battin. The Brasserie Nationale was born in 1975 from the fusion of two breweries: The Brasserie Bofferding, founded by Jean-Baptiste Bofferding in 1842, and the Brasserie Funck-Bricher founded in 1764. History The Brasserie Nationale was founded in 1975 from the fusion of two breweries: The Brasserie Bofferding from Bascharage, and the Brasserie Funck-Bricher, located at the Grund district in Luxembourg City. =Brasserie Bofferding= Brasserie Bofferding was founded in 1842 in Bascharage (where the Brewery of Brasserie Nationale is still located today) by Jean-Baptiste Bofferding. The brewery continuously expanded in southern Luxembourg until finally merging with Brasserie Funck-Bricher in 1975. =Brasserie Funck-Bricher= Brasserie Funck-Bricher was founded in 1764 (hence the marked date on today's Bofferding bottles) and brewed in the Grund district in Luxembourg City. The brewery of Brasserie Funck-Bricher was located next to the Grund bridge over the river Alzette (In the building where today Amazon EU has its office). In 1916 Brasserie Funck-Bricher was named fournisseur de la cour. In 1964 Brasserie Funck-Bricher successfully bought Brasserie de Dudelange.http://www.industrie.lu/brasseriefunckbricher.html =Creating Brasserie Nationale= In 1975 Brasserie Bofferding and Brasserie Funck- Bricher merged. After the fusion of the two breweries was completed, the newly founded Brasserie Nationale closed the old brewery at Grund in Luxembourg-City and relocated its production completely to the Bofferding brewery in Bascharage. They also decided that all beer brewed from then on would be sold under the name Bofferding, thus the Funck-Bricher beer brand ceased to exist. In 2004 Brasserie Nationale bought Brasserie Battin from Esch-Alzette (which was founded in 1937) and transferred the production of Battin-beer also to its brewery in Bascharage where it is still brewed today.

Temesv√°ri Pelb√°rt Ferences Gimn√°zium. 1823 ‚Äì 5 October 1864) was a Hungarian aristocrat, writer, poet, lawyer and politician. His major work is The Tragedy of Man (Az ember trag√©di√°ja, 1861). It is a dramatic poem approximately 4000 lines long, which elaborates on ideas comparable to Goethe's Faust. The author was encouraged and advised by J√°nos Arany, one of the most famous of the 19th- century Hungarian poets. Life He was born in his family castle in Als√≥sztregova, the Kingdom of Hungary (today Doln√° Strehov√°, Slovakia) in 1823 at the heart of a wealthy noble family. From 1829 Mad√°ch studied at the Piarist school of V√°c. His biography During a cholera epidemic he stayed in Buda in 1831. In 1837 he began his studies at the university of Pest. In 1842 he officially became a lawyer. In 1860 he finished working on The Tragedy of Man. He died in Als√≥sztregova in the Kingdom of Hungary. Works *A civiliz√°tor (The Civiliser) ‚Äì 1859 *M√≥zes (Moses) ‚Äì 1861 *Az ember trag√©di√°ja (The Tragedy of Man) ‚Äì 1861 The Tragedy of Man The dramatic poem The Tragedy of Man is Mad√°ch's major and most enduring piece of writing. The tragic events of the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49 in addition to the deaths of close family members such as his sister and her husband, captain Karl Balog de M√°nko-B√ºk, and his temporary stay in prison fueled the emotional status in which he completed his work. Today it is the central piece of Hungarian theaters' repertoire and is mandatory reading for students in secondary school. Many lines have become common quotes in Hungary. Mad√°ch, then a country nobleman with virtually no literary experience, sent the work to the poet Arany who enthusiastically encouraged him and suggested some emendations to the text. The piece was at first only published in printed form, not staged, because the many changes of scene (15 scenes) were hard to come by through the technical standards of the day. The main characters are Adam, Eve and Lucifer. The three travel through time to visit different turning-points in human history and Lucifer tries to convince Adam that life is (will be) meaningless and mankind is doomed. Adam and Lucifer are introduced at the beginning of each scene, with Adam assuming various important historical roles and Lucifer usually acting as a servant or confidant. Eve enters only later in each scene. The Tragedy of Man contains fifteen scenes, with ten historical periods represented.

Known as a narrative historian, Catton specialized in popular history, featuring interesting characters and historical vignettes, in addition to the basic facts, dates, and analyses. His books were researched well and included footnotes. He won a Pulitzer Prize during 1954 for A Stillness at Appomattox, his study of the final campaign of the war in Virginia. Early life Charles Bruce Catton was born in Petoskey, Michigan, to George R. and Adela M. (Patten) Catton, and raised in Benzonia, Michigan. His father was a Congregationalist minister, who accepted a teaching position in Benzonia Academy and later became the academy's headmaster. As a boy, Catton first heard the reminiscences of the aged veterans who had fought in the Civil War. In his memoir, Waiting for the Morning Train (1972), Catton explained how their stories made a lasting impression upon him: During 1916, Catton began attending Oberlin College, but he quit without completing a degree because of World War I. Journalism career After serving briefly with the United States Navy during World War I, Catton became a reporter and editor for the newspapers The Cleveland News (as a freelance reporter), the Boston American (1920‚Äì1924), and the Cleveland The Plain Dealer (1925). From 1926 to 1941, he worked for the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a Scripps- Howard syndicate), for which he wrote editorials and book reviews, as well as serving as a Washington, D.C. correspondent. Catton tried twice to complete his studies, but found himself repeatedly distracted by his newspaper work. Oberlin College awarded him an honorary degree in 1956. Writing career At the start of World War II, Catton was too old for military service. During 1941, he accepted a position as Director of Information for the War Production Board, and later he had similar jobs in the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior. His experiences as a federal employee prepared him to write his first book, The War Lords Of Washington, during 1948. Although the book was not a commercial success, it inspired Catton to quit federal employment to become a full-time author.Jensen, Oliver. \\"Working with Bruce Catton\\" in American Heritage, February/March 1979 In 1954, Catton accepted the position as founding editor of the new magazine American Heritage. Catton served initially as a writer, reviewer, and editor. In the first issue, he wrote: =Army of the Potomac trilogy= In the early 1950s, Catton published three books known collectively as the Army of the Potomac trilogy, a history of that army. For Mr. Lincoln's Army (1951), the first volume, Catton recounted the army's formation, the command of George B. McClellan, the Peninsula Campaign, the Northern Virginia Campaign, and the Battle of Antietam. For the second volume, Glory Road (1952), Catton recounted the army's history with new commanding generals, from the Battle of Fredericksburg to the Battle of Gettysburg. For his final volume of the trilogy, A Stillness at Appomattox (1953), Catton recounted the campaigns of Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia from 1864 to the end of the war during 1865. It was his first commercially successful work and it won both the Pulitzer Prize for History\\"History\\". Past winners & finalists by category. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved March 19, 2012. and a National Book Award for Nonfiction. The three volumes were reissued in 1988 as a single volume reprint, titled Bruce Catton's Civil War. =Centennial History of the Civil War= From 1961 to 1965, the Centennial of the Civil War was commemorated, and Catton published his Centennial History of the Civil War trilogy. Unlike his previous trilogy, these books emphasized not only military topics, but social, economic, and political topics as well. For the first volume, The Coming Fury (1961), Catton discussed the causes of the war, culminating in its first major combat operation, the First Battle of Bull Run. For the second volume, Terrible Swift Sword (1963), he discussed both sides as they mobilize for a massive war effort. The story continued through 1862, ending with McClellan's dismissal after the Battle of Antietam. For the third volume, Never Call Retreat (1965), the war continued through the battles of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and the bloody struggles of 1864 and 1865 before the final surrender. =Ulysses S. Grant trilogy= After the publication of Captain Sam Grant (1950) by historian and biographer Lloyd Lewis, Catton wrote the second and third volumes of this trilogy, making extensive use of Lewis's historical research, provided by his widow, Kathryn Lewis, who personally selected Catton to continue her husband's work. In Grant Moves South (1960), Catton discussed the increasing experience of Grant as a military commander, from victories at the Battle of Fort Henry and the Battle of Fort Donelson, to the Battle of Shiloh and the Vicksburg Campaign. In Grant Takes Command (1969), Catton discussed Grant's career from the Battle of Chattanooga (1863) through the 1864 Virginia campaigns against Robert E. Lee and the end of the war. =Other Civil War books= In addition to these three important trilogies, Catton wrote extensively about the Civil War throughout his career. In U. S. Grant and the American Military Tradition (1954), Catton writes what many consider one of the best short biographies of the general. In Banners at Shenandoah: A Story of Sheridan's Fighting Cavalry (1955), Catton wrote for young people about Union cavalry commander Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley during 1864. This Hallowed Ground (1956) was an account of the war from the Union perspective. Upon its publication, it was widely considered the best single volume history of the Civil War, receiving a Fletcher Pratt Award from the Civil War Round Table of New York during 1957. In America Goes to War (1958), Catton made the case that the American Civil War was one of the first total wars. In The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War (1960), Catton wrote the accompanying narrative to a book that included more than 800 paintings and period photographs. It received a special Pulitzer Prize citation during 1961. In The American Heritage Short History of the Civil War (1960), Catton offers a narrative that discussed the military and political aspects of the war. In Two Roads to Sumter (1963), written with his son William, Catton recounted the 15 years prior to the war, as considered from the points of view of the two main politicians involved in the conflict: Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis. In Gettysburg: The Final Fury (1974), Catton offered a slim volume concerning the Battle of Gettysburg, dominated by photographs and illustrations. =Other books= In addition to Civil War histories, Catton published other books, including The War Lords Of Washington (1948), an account of Washington, D.C., during World War II, based on his experiences in the federal government, Four Days: The Historical Record Of The Death Of President Kennedy (1964), a 144-page collaboration of the American Heritage magazine and United Press International on the John F. Kennedy assassination, and Waiting for the Morning Train (1972), about the author's Michigan boyhood. Toward the end of his life, Catton published Michigan: A Bicentennial History (1976) and The Bold & Magnificent Dream: America's Founding Years, 1492‚Äì1815 (1978).  Criticism  American writer Gore Vidal, whose essays primarily concern the history of the United States and its society, criticizes Catton for a hagiographic approach to writing about prominent Americans of the past, calling him \\"that ubiquitous clone of Parson Weems.\\" (Weems is remembered primarily for his whitewashed paeans to the Founding Fathers.) Vidal groups Catton with American historians who \\"never accept as a fact anything that might obscure those figures illuminated by the high noon of Demos....\\"Vidal p. 709 As an example, he cites Catton's dismissal of stories related to Grant's alcohol consumption during the Civil War and places Catton \\"in Parson Weems land where all our presidents were good and some were great and none ever served out his term without visibly growing in office.\\" Vidal p. 710 Personal life On August 16, 1925, Catton married Hazel H. Cherry. During 1926, they had a son, William Bruce Catton, who taught history at Princeton University and at Middlebury College, Vermont, where he was the first Charles A. Dana Professor of History. Death and legacy Bruce Catton died in a hospital near his summer home at Frankfort, Michigan, after a respiratory illness. He was buried in Benzonia Township Cemetery in Benzie County, Michigan. During 1977, the year before his death, Catton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's greatest civilian honor, from President Gerald R. Ford, who noted that the author and historian \\"made us hear the sounds of battle and cherish peace.\\" Of the many Civil War historians, Catton was arguably the most prolific and popular. Oliver Jensen, who succeeded him as editor of the magazine American Heritage, wrote: The Bruce Catton Collection is housed in the Archives of The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. =The Civil War Documentary= Ken Burns's television documentary The Civil War was based partly on Bruce Catton's books, and resulted in a revival of interest in his histories. =Bruce Catton Prize= Since 1984, the Bruce Catton Prize was awarded for lifetime achievement in the writing of history. In cooperation with American Heritage Publishing Company, the Society of American Historians during 1984 initiated the biennial prize that honors an entire body of work. It is named for Bruce Catton, prizewinning historian and first editor of American Heritage magazine. The prize consisted of a certificate and $2,500. The prize was awarded to Dumas Malone (1984), C. Vann Woodward (1986), Richard B. Morris (1988), Henry Steele Commager (1990), Edmund S. Morgan (1992), John Hope Franklin (1994), Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (1996), Richard N.

Song Jiang ( 12th century) was the leader of a band of robbers who marauded over a region straddling the present-day provinces of Shandong and Henan some time in the middle period of the Song dynasty. They finally surrendered to the government. The historical Song Jiang was turned into a fictional character in Water Margin, one of the Four Great Classical Novels in Chinese literature, in which he is depicted as the leader of the 108 Stars of Destiny, who gather as bandits in Shandong's Liangshan Marsh. Life Song Jiang is mentioned in the History of Song, the most authoritative of records on the history of the Song dynasty. It is said in the portion relating to Emperor Huizong () that: Another account, from the portion relating to Zhang Shuye in the History of Song, records the following: The History of Song also recorded a memorial from the official Hou Meng to Emperor Huizong. It says: In Water Margin The fictional Song Jiang in Water Margin is based on the historical one and folktales that had been circulating in the Shandong region. One tale, for example, is about \\"36 huge banners and 72 smaller banners of local bandits\\", a likely origin of the 108 Stars of Destiny in Water Margin. =Background= In Water Margin, Song Jiang is depicted as short, swarthy, and having a big squarish mouth and eyes like those of a fenghuang. He lives and works in Yuncheng County, where he serves as a clerk of the magistrate. He is nicknamed \\"Timely Rain\\" because he is generous and helpful, often assisting heroes in difficulties and the indigent. As he is known to be filial, he is also called \\"Filial and Righteous Dark Third Son\\" and \\"Dark Song Jiang\\", with \\"dark\\" referring to his complexion. After all the 108 Stars of Destiny come together at Liangshan, he goes by another nickname, \\"Protector of Justice\\", to advertise his conviction in life. He is trained in both scholarly and martial arts, but he is apparently not a great fighter. He has a younger brother named Song Qing. Song Jiang is a close friend of Yuncheng's chief constables, Zhu Tong and Lei Heng, as well as Chao Gai, the headman of Yuncheng's Dongxi Village. After Chao and his six confederates hijacked valuables from a conveyance to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing, the government of Jizhou is under pressure to solve the case as Yellow Mud Ridge, the site of the robbery, is within its jurisdiction. He Tao, the chief constable of Jizhou, is tasked with tracking down the robbers. Song runs into He at the magistrate office of Yuncheng, who tells him he has identified Chao Gai as the mastermind. Upon hearing this, Song excuses himself and rushes to Dongxi Village to warn Chao. The robbers thus manage to pack up in time and escape. They seek refuge in the outlaw stronghold at Liangshan Marsh. But Wang Lun, the chief of Liangshan, does not welcome them. Chao is elected in his place after Lin Chong kills Wang. =Killing Yan Poxi= Meanwhile, Song Jiang has taken Yan Poxi as his mistress at her mother's insistence as their repayment for his funding of her father's funeral. They got along without problem initially. However, Yan Poxi soon detested Song Jiang, who has no fancy for women, after knowing Zhang Wenyuan, Song's clerical assistant, and getting into an affair with him. To convey his gratitude, Chao Gai sends Liu Tang to deliver one hundred pieces of gold each to Song Jiang and Zhu Tong, who has also aided his escape. Liu also brings along a letter from Chao for Song. Song is shocked to find Liu greeting him on the street one night. He refuses to take all the gold, accepting only one piece as a token. That night he is forced to go to sleep with Yan Poxi by Yan's mother. Yan discovers Chao's letter, which reveals Song's involvement with the outlaws of Liangshan. She threatens to report him to the authorities unless he meets three demands: divorce her and allow her to marry Zhang Wenyuan; let her keep all the things he has given her; and hand over all the gold pieces he received from Chao. Song agrees to the first two but could not accede to the third as he has accepted only one gold piece. As Yan refuses to believe him and repeatedly threatens to expose him, Song becomes agitated and kills her with a dagger that he always carries in his bag. He flees to hide in a pit in the house of his father. Zhu Tong, who is sent to arrest him, locates him in the vault as Song has once told him about it. But Zhu lets him go. Song runs away from Yuncheng and becomes a fugitive. =Battle of Qingfeng Fort= Song Jiang takes shelter in the residence of nobleman Chai Jin, where he comes to know Wu Song. He meets Wu again, who has become an itinerant priest to hide his identity after committing a series of killings, when he stays at the Kong Family Manor at Mount White Tiger. Song next moves to the house of Hua Rong, garrison commandant of Qingfeng Fort (Ê∏ÖÈ¢®ÂØ®; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong), invited by Hua. When he is near to the fort, he is trapped and nearly killed by the three chieftains of Mount Qingfeng (Ê∏ÖÈ¢®Â±±) -- Yan Shun, Wang Ying and Zheng Tianshou. The trio treat him with respect upon learning he is Song Jiang as his chivalrous deeds are widely known. Song prevents Wang Ying from raping a woman he has abducted and secures her release when he finds out she is the wife of Liu Gao, the governor of Qingfeng Fort and Hua Rong's superior. On the Lantern Festival night, Song Jiang, who is then living in Hua Rong's house, goes outdoor to watch the celebrations. Liu Gao's wife spots him and lies to her husband that Song had abducted her at Mount Qingfeng and attempted to rape her. Believing his wife, Liu orders Song arrested. Hua Rong barges into Liu's house and frees Song. As Song flees to Mount Qingfeng following Hua‚Äòs advice he is waylaid and re-arrested by Liu's men. Meanwhile, Hua is seized in an ambush by Huang Xin, a military officer sent from Qingzhou prefecture, which oversees Qingfeng Fort. As Huang escorts Song and Hua back to Qingzhou, the convoy is intercepted by the bandits of Mount Qingfeng, who rescue the two prisoners. Liu is killed in the fight while Huang escapes. Qingzhou sends Qin Ming, a higher officer, to eliminate Mount Qingfeng. But Qin is caught in a trap and brought before Song. Although Qin is glad to meet Song, having heard much about him, he refuses to join the stronghold. As Qin spends the night at Mount Qingfeng, Song sends bandits led by a man disguised as him to pillage and raze a suburb of Qingzhou. Murong Yanda, the governor of Qingzhou, falls for the ruse and executes Qin's family. That forces Qin to defect to Song's camp. As Qinghou is likely to send a bigger force, Song suggests the group go join the band at Liangshan. But he leaves the group halfway when he runs into Shi Yong, who hands him a letter from Song Qing which falsely claims that their father has passed away. Exile to Jiangzhou Song Jiang returns to Yuncheng to find his father alive. The old man has faked death to lure him back to prevent him from falling into bad company. Alerted to his return, Yuncheng's authorities arrest Song over the killing of Yan Poxi. Due to his past service at the magistrate office, Song is spared the death penalty. He is tattooed on the face and exiled to Jiangzhou (Ê±üÂ∑û; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi). On the way, Song Jiang and his two escorts pass by Jieyang Ridge and are nearly butchered by the innkeeper Li Li after being drugged. He is saved by Li Jun, another of his admirers. Informed of Song's exile, Li Jun has been waiting by the Xunyang River expecting to meet him. He happens to come to Li Li's inn for refreshment. They revive Song after confirming his identity through the official document on the escorts. They treat him with hospitality before seeing him off. At Jieyang Town, Song generously tips Xue Yong, a street performer of martial arts, seeing that no onlooker awards him for his show. In doing that he offends the brothers Mu Hong and Mu Chun, who wield immense influence over the town. Because Xue, who is from out of town, has not gone to pay them respects, the Mus have ordered the townfolks not to give him a cent. That night Song and his escorts happen to be offered accommodation in the Mus' house by their kindly father. When he discovers they are in danger, the three flee. Pursued by the Mus, they desperately board the boat of pirate Zhang Heng at Xunyang River. Midway across the river, Zhang wants to kill them. Song is again saved by Li Jun, who passes by in his boat. Zhang and the Mu brothers are shocked to learn that the man is Song Jiang. Song receives warm treatment from his new friends before proceeding on to Jiangzhou. At Jiangzhou, Song Jiang comes to know the chief warden Dai Zong, who is a friend of Wu Yong, the chief strategist of Liangshan, and jailer Li Kui. He and Li take to each other as Song is generous and Li straightforward. Song also comes to know the fishmonger Zhang Shun, Zhang Heng‚Äòs younger brother. As Song is allowed to move freely in and out of jail by Dai, one day he goes alone to drink at a restaurant on the bank of the Xunyang River. Feeling miserable over his misfortunes, he writes a poem in drunkenness on the wall in the eatery. He forgets the incident the next day. Huang Wenbing, a petty official, discovers the poem, which he determines to be seditious, and reports it to Cai Jiu, the prefect of Jiangzhou. Cai, a son of Cai Jing, orders Song arrested and sends Dai Zong to Dongjing to seek advice from his father on the matter. However, Dai ends up in Liangshan disclosing the news to the outlaws. Wu Yong forges a letter ordering Cai Jiu to transfer Song Jiang to Dongjing. The plan is to rescue Song when he is conveyed there. But Huang Wenbing spots a giveaway in the letter. Furious, Cai Jiu sentences both Song and Dai to death. Wu Yong meanwhile has realised the mistake and sends a number of chieftains to Jiangzhou to rescue them. They storm the execution ground and carry the two away. But they are stranded at a riverbank. Fortunately Li Jun arrives with all the friends of Song Jiang from the Jieyang region in boats and they are ferried to safety. After killing Huang Wenbing, Song goes with the bunch to Liangshan, where he takes the second position after Chao Gai. =As chief of Liangshan= Song Jiang goes home to fetch his father and Song Qing to Liangshan. But news of his return leaks and constables come after him. Fleeing, Song stumbles into the temple of a goddess and hides in a closet. Falling into a nap, he dreams of meeting the goddess, who gives him three heavenly books which she says would guide him in his leadership of Liangshan. He wakes up to find himself holding the three books. A stone statue of Song Jiang at Hengdian World Studios. In almost every of Liangshan's military conflicts, Song Jiang is the commander. He leads the three offensives on the Zhu Family Manor, the attack on Gaotangzhou to save Chai Jin, the fight against Huyan Zhuo's attempt to stamp out Liangshan, the battle at Qingzhou which ends with absorption of three strongholds, the effort to rescue Shi Jin and Lu Zhishen at Huazhou, the engagement with Fan Rui at Mount Mangdang, the assault on Daming to save Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu, the face-off against Guan Sheng, and the expedition against the Zeng Family Fortress to avenge the death of Chao Gai. Chao is killed in action when he, for the first time heading a military force, battles with the Zeng Family Fortress. Song Jiang becomes Liangshan's acting chief pending the capture of Chao's killer Shi Wengong. Chao has left word that whoever seizes his killer would succeed him. Although it is Lu Junyi who catches Shi, in the end Song Jiang becomes the chief of Liangshan. That comes after he beat Lu in a contest in which they agreed whoever overran the prefecture assigned to him first would be made chief. Song conquered Dongping first while Lu stalled in his effort to take Dongchang. Although his crimes are egregious and he is regarded as a colossal threat by the government, Song Jiang harbours the wish to serve the Song Empire. He crafts a slogan \\"Deliver Justice on Heaven's behalf\\" (ÊõøÂ§©Ë°åÈÅì)\\" to signal that Liangshan is committed to just causes and is led by people loyal to the emperor. After many attempts, including enlisting the help of Li Shishi, a courtesan patronised by Emperor Huizong, Song Jiang finally wins amnesty for Liangshan. But the emperor sends them on a series of expeditions against invaders from the Liao Empire and rebel forces in Song territory to prove their loyalty. The last of these, which is against the rebel Fang La, is highly costly, with at least two thirds of the 108 heroes killed in action or by disease. =Death= Through with the expeditions, Song Jiang is appointed governor of Chuzhou (Ê•öÂ∑û; present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu). But the corrupt officials in the imperial court are unhappy that he is doing fine. They send him a jar of poisoned wine in the emperor's name which he is obliged to drink. When Song Jiang realises he has been poisoned, he is worried that the hot- tempered Li Kui will rebel against the Song Empire and tarnish the good name of Liangshan. So, he invites Li to Chuzhou and offers him the same wine. Both of them die. In the last chapter of Water Margin, the ghosts of Song Jiang and Li Kui appear in Emperor Huizong's dream and tell him about their wrongful deaths. Although the emperor orders an inquiry, it comes to nothing as the key witness ‚Äì the emissary who sent the wine to Song Jiang ‚Äì has died mysteriously on the way back to Dongjing. The emperor makes amends to Song only by conferring on him a posthumous title. Song Jiang's seditious poem The following two poems are written by Song Jiang at Xunyang Tower in Jiangzhou after he getting drunk. It is the second one that carries a seditious message. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellmargin=\\"0\\" -----  style=\\"font-size:100%\\"  Ëá™ÂπºÊõæÊîªÁ∂ìÂè≤ÔºåÈï∑Êàê‰∫¶ÊúâÊ¨äË¨Ä„ÄÇ  I have read the classics and annals since I was a child, When I grew up I learnt politics and strategy. -----  style=\\"font-size:100%\\"  ÊÅ∞Â¶ÇÁåõËôéËá•Ëçí‰∏òÔºåÊΩõ‰ºèÁà™ÁâôÂøçÂèó„ÄÇ  Just like a ferocious tiger hiding in the hills, sheathing its claws and jaws while waiting and enduring. -----  style=\\"font- size:100%\\"  ‰∏çÂπ∏Âà∫ÊñáÈõôÈ†∞ÔºåÈÇ£Â†™ÈÖçÂú®Ê±üÂ∑û„ÄÇ  How unfortunate to be branded on both cheeks, and exiled to Jiangzhou. -----  style=\\"font-size:100%\\"  ‰ªñÂπ¥Ëã•ÂæóÂ†±ÂÜ§ËÆéÔºåË°ÄÊüìÊΩØÈôΩÊ±üÂè£!  If one day I can redress my grievances, the Xunyang River will be covered in blood! } Song Jiang then reads what he has written, laughing hysterically. He consumes more drinks and starts to clap and dance with frenzied joy. He picks up the ink brush and writes another four lines: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellmargin=\\"0\\" -----  style=\\"font-size:100%\\"  ÂøÉÂú®Â±±Êù±Ë∫´Âú®Âê≥ÔºåÈ£ÑËì¨Ê±üÊµ∑Ë¨æÂóüÁ±≤„ÄÇ   My heart is in Shandong but I am in Wu, I wander around alone sighing. -----  style=\\"font-size:100%\\"  ‰ªñÊôÇËã•ÈÅÇÊ∑©Èõ≤Ë™åÔºåÊï¢Á¨ëÈªÉÂ∑¢‰∏ç‰∏àÂ§´!   If one day I can realise my noble ambitions, (I) would dare to deride Huang Chao as unmanly! } He then signs off at the end: \\"Work by Song Jiang from Yuncheng\\" (ÈÑÜÂüéÂÆãÊ±ü‰Ωú). The second poem is deemed seditious because of the last two lines. Huang Chao launched an uprising near the end of the Tang dynasty, which led to its crumble. Huang Wenbing interprets these two lines to mean: \\"If Song Jiang ever gets an opportunity to start a rebellion (against the Song dynasty), he will do things worse than Huang Chao.\\" See also Yan Poxi and Song Jiang, from a 2015 Peking opera performance in Tianchan Theatre, Shanghai, China. * List of Water Margin minor characters#Song Jiang's story for a list of supporting minor characters from Song Jiang's story.

Beck was recognized for his extraordinary ability as a field worker by Robert Cushman Murphy as being \\"in a class by himself,\\" and by University of California at Berkeley professor of zoology Frank Pitelka as \\"the field worker\\" of his generation.Pitelka, Frank A. 1986. Rollo Beck - Old- school collector, member of an endangered species. American Birds 40(3): 385-387. Early years Rollo Howard Beck was born in Los Gatos, California, and grew up in Berryessa working on apricot and prune orchards. He completed only an 8th grade education, but took an early interest in natural history, trapping gophers after school on neighborhood farms. One of his neighbors, Frank H. Holmes, was a good friend of the ornithologist Theodore Sherman Palmer. Palmer also introduced Beck to Charles Keeler, who studied birdlife of the San Francisco Bay Area, and Beck learned about upland birds hunting quail with Holmes. Beck's interest and knowledge of birds grew, and he soon learned how to make ornithological specimens and mount birds for museum collections. He joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1894, and was among the first members of the newly formed Cooper Ornithological Society which formed in San Jose, California. He participated in early ornithological expeditions to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Yosemite, and Lake Tahoe with Holmes and Wilfred Hudson Osgood, and collected and helped describe the first eggs and nests of the western evening grosbeak and hermit warbler.s:The Condor/1 (5)/Rollo H. Beck Expeditions Beck preparing a taxidermy mount of a Gal√°pagos tortoise =Channel Islands of California= In the spring of 1897, Beck headed south to Santa Barbara, California, where he learned to sail a moderate-sized schooner under captain Sam Burtis. He visited the Channel Islands of California, including Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel islands collecting and documenting birds as well as nests and eggs. Beck was the first to collect and document the differences of the island scrub-jays that live on the Channel Islands, now recognized as distinct from mainland forms.s:The Condor/1 (1)/Nesting of the Santa Cruz Jay =Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador= Later in 1897, while on his way back to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Beck was invited to join an ornithological expedition to the Gal√°pagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador, organized by Frank Blake WebsterBarrow, Jr., Mark V. 2000.

Journal of the History of Biology 33: 493-534. and funded by Lionel Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England, later, and only after his father's death in 1915, Lord Rothschild. The expedition was launched to study and collect giant tortoises and the land birds of the Gal√°pagos, and here Beck also polished his sailing skills and became better acquainted with seabirds and the unique fauna of the Gal√°pagos. Beck returned again to the Gal√°pagos to collect more specimens around 1901, and he personally delivered these specimens to Walter Rothschild in Tring. While in Tring, he planned future potential collecting trips to Colombia for Rothschild, and he returned to California by way of Washington, DC, in order to apply for the necessary permits. =Cocos and Gal√°pagos= Back in San Francisco, Beck met with Leverett Mills Loomis, Director of the California Academy of Sciences. Loomis was interested in seabirds, especially the Tubinares, now the Procellariiformes, and hired Beck to collect in Monterey Bay, the Channel Islands of California, and the Revillagigedo Islands of Mexico, while he waited for his Colombia permits. In 1905‚Äì1906, Beck was hired by the California Academy of Sciences to organize and lead a large seagoing expedition to Cocos Island and the Gal√°pagos Islands aboard the Schooner ‚ÄúAcademy.‚Äù Loomis organized scientific specialists in botany, herpetology, entomology, and malacology, geology, paleontology, as well as ornithology. Besides Beck, the expedition's scientists were: Alban Stewart, botanist; W. H. Ochsner, geologist/paleontologist/malacologist; F. X. Williams, entomologist/malacologist; E. W. Gifford and J. S. Hunter, ornithologists; J. R. Slevin and E. S. King, herpetologists. Together they assembled the largest scientific collection of specimens from the archipelago ever, leading to our great understanding of the biota of the islands. The great April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake and three days of subsequent fire struck while Beck and the expedition were still in the Gal√°pagos Islands. They would not return to San Francisco until Thanksgiving Day, November 29, 1906. Their extensive collections of some 78,000 specimens allowed the Academy as an institution to rise, literally and figuratively, from the ashes of \\"the great conflagration\\" that devastated San Francisco.James, Matthew J. 2012.

Some historians believe that had Beck and the expedition not been out to sea and collecting, the Academy would have suffered a lethal blow.James, Matthew J. 2010. Collecting Evolution: Vindication of Charles Darwin by the 1905-1906 Galapagos Expedition of the California Academy of Sciences. Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, 4th Series, Vol. 61, Suppl. II, No. 12, pp. 197-210. Beck married his wife and lifelong companion, Ida Menzies of Berryessa, in 1907 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He went to work for Joseph Grinnell, the Director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, in the spring of 1908, and collected waterbirds for Grinnell's studies of California birds. Before long, Beck was offered even more money by Dr. Leonard C. Sanford, of New Haven, Connecticut, to collect birds in Alaska for the well- known ornithologist Arthur Cleveland Bent, who was collecting for his studies of ‚ÄúThe Life Histories of North American Birds.‚Äù He did much of the field work with the young Alexander Wetmore, who had recently graduated from college. =Brewster-Sanford Expedition to South America= In 1912, Dr. Leonard Cutler Sanford proposed a larger two-year expedition (that ended up taking five years) to South America for Rollo and Ida, and financed by Mr. F. F. Brewster. They traveled up into lakes and highlands of the Andes, along the coast, and out at sea to the Falkland Islands and Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, sailed around Cape Horn in a 12-ton cutter, and up into the Caribbean. This work and these collections proved invaluable to Robert Cushman Murphy, who later published ‚ÄúThe Oceanic Birds of South America‚ÄùMurphy, Robert Cushman. (1936). The Oceanic Birds of South America. American Museum of Natural History. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/45089#page/1/mode/1up https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44597#page/9/mode/1up based in part on the Brewster-Sanford Expedition collection of Rollo Beck. =Whitney South Seas Expedition= In 1920 Beck was contacted by Dr. Sanford who proposed an extended South Pacific expedition. The fieldwork was funded by Harry Payne Whitney of New York, and the specimens were bound for the American Museum of Natural History. This became the longest and greatest of all Beck's expeditions and, as with the \\"Academy\\" expedition of 1905‚Äì06, he was joined by many other accomplished biologists and field collectors with complementary skills, including E. H. Quayle, J. G. Correia, Dr F. P. Drowne, Hannibal Hamlin, Guy Richards, Ernst Mayr, E. H. Bryan Jr., and others. Beck left the expedition in 1929, after sailing through the Pacific, from Tahiti to New Guinea to New Zealand and visiting hundreds of islands between. Rollo and Ida Beck returned to the California in 1929 with over 40,000 bird skins and a large anthropological collection. This expedition remains to this day the most comprehensive survey and study of birds in the south-west Pacific islands, and has been written up in dozens of important scientific monographs of birds. The specimens residing at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City form the most comprehensive collection of Pacific birds anywhere. Rollo and Ida Beck retired to the northern California town of Planada, near Merced, where they continued to study natural history and provide specimens of great scientific value. Most of these later specimens are housed at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, and at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. There is also a substantial collection at San Jose State University. There is a smaller collection of mounted specimens on exhibit at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History, in the town of Pacific Grove, California, as well as a permanent exhibit devoted to the life and work of Rollo Beck. Contributions to Science The work of Beck and other early ornithologists was undertaken primarily to document biodiversity before it was lost forever without being recorded, and to understand the evolution and ecology of organisms from the regions visited during the expeditions.See also: Dumbacher, J.P. and West, B. 2010. The work of Beck and others brought an awareness of and a catalog of regional biodiversity that is essential to have in order to do modern conservation. Much of what we know about western U.S. birds and Pacific ornithology ‚Äì from Bent's \\"Life Histories of North American Birds\\"Life Histories of North American Birds https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/59509#page/7/mode/1up to Murphy's \\"Oceanic Birds of South America\\"Oceanic Birds of South America https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/45089#page/10/mode/1up \\\\- rests on the fieldwork of Rollo Beck and other early ornithologists. Our understanding of global biodiversity and the practice of modern conservation biology, much of which seems to be anti-collecting, owes much to these early collectors who worked so diligently to document and preserve voucher specimens in museums. Controversy Human history is replete with examples of island species that were being persecuted by farmers, ranchers, hunters, and sailors; were being harvested unsustainably; and were being decimated by introduced species.Quammen, David. (1997). The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction. New York: Simon & Schuster . By comparison, scientific collectors were relatively few in number and seldom took large numbers of specimens of any one species, but competition between museums and private collectors to acquire the rarest of the rare put disproportionate collecting pressure on species whose populations were already teetering on the brink for other reasons. Beck and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were responding to published statements that \\"time was running out\\" and that species should be collected and documented in museum collections \\"before it is too late.\\" In the absence of a conservation framework and infrastructure, Beck and others engaged in what can be called \\"salvage collecting,\\" which does not correspond to modern conservation thinking. Rollo Beck has been blamed for having collected a sample of Guadalupe caracaras in 1900 which were being exterminated by goat herders who viewed the bird as a predator.Bousman, William G. (2005). Local Ornithology in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries. Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society. At the time he assumed the birds were common on Guadalupe Island, but in retrospect he wrote that those he collected might have been the last. Beck also collected, as museum specimens, three of the last four individuals of the subspecies of Gal√°pagos tortoise Geochelone nigra abingdonii, the Pinta Island tortoise. The last individual of that island's tortoise population became known as Lonesome George when it was found on Pinta Island in November 1971.

It consists of a set of 24 hut circles surrounded by a low stone wall. The name was first recorded by the Reverend Richard Polwhele in 1797; it was probably derived from the Anglo-Saxon god of war, Grim (more commonly known as Woden, or Odin). In 1893 an archaeological dig was carried out by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee, which recorded many details of Grimspound as well as, controversially, making a reconstruction of the site. History The site was first settled in about 1300 BC. The 24 hut circles are surrounded by a massive granite perimeter wall, which may have stood at 1.7 metres in places. The roundhouses, with an average diameter of 3.4 metres, were each built of a double ring of granite slabs with a rubble infill, a technique still used in dry-stone walling. Hut 3 has a surviving porchway, with the two jamb stones still upright, although the lintel has fallen. There is evidence of human activity: artefacts include pottery, scrapers and pot boilers. Organic remains such as wood and textiles have not survived owing to the acid nature of the soil. =Early descriptions= The name Grimspound was first recorded by the Reverend Polwhele in his History of Devon of 1797. He called it \\"The seat of judicature\\" for the River Dart area, and also surmised that it was \\"one of the principal temples of the Druids. Other ideas about Grimspound include supposed uses as an Iron Age fort, an encampment for tin miners and even a Phoenician settlement.Chapman, 5‚Äì7. Grimspound was first mapped by A. C. Shillibear in 1829. An 1855 plan by Nick Whitely shows hut circles outlying the perimeter wall, unrecorded elsewhere. =Excavation= In 1893 the Dartmoor Exploration Committee began a dig at the site.\\"The Exploration of Grimspound - First report of the Dartmoor Exploration Committee\\" in Report & Transactions of the Devonshire Association., no. 26 1894, pp. 101-21 The dig, one of whose members was the Reverend Sabine Baring- Gould, reconstructed some of the site, a move criticised by some of the Committee at the time and also by later researchers, including R. Hansford Worth.Chapman, 8. Location Grimspound is located in the valley between Hameldown Tor and Hookney Tor, at 450 metres above sea level. The nearest village, Widecombe-in-the-Moor, is a few miles to the south. Description Eastern end of Grimspound Grimspound's outer wall The site is enclosed by a stone wall, interrupted by a large, paved entrance facing south, uphill towards Hameldown. The wall would have been substantial ‚Äì in some places its ruins are more than 15 feet (4.5 m) in thickness. However, the site is of limited value from a defensive point of view, so the assumption is that the wall was to keep livestock in, and predators out. It is possible that it was topped by a hedge or fence.Chapman, 12. On the northern edge of the site is the start of the West Webburn, which was the main water source for the settlement. Grimspound's southern entrance The entrance is described as \\"the most imposing of all\\" by Jeremy Butler.Butler, 107. It is a paved and stepped corridor 5.5 metres long and almost 2 metres wide, with megaliths and other large stones forming the sides. Butler states that it was not designed to exclude livestock. Excavations at other sites on Dartmoor have shown that such walls were probably built by small teams of men working simultaneously on a section each, as shown by differences in building style; some evidence of this is visible here. However, these may simply be due to the reconstruction work by the 1894 excavation (see below). =The hut circles= One of Grimspound's hut circles Twenty-four stone hut circles have been officially recorded here, although there are probably remains of more within the enclosure, which has an area of over 16,000 square metres (four acres). Many of these hut circles feature L-shaped porches. The doorways are paved with naturally flat stones, and all face both downhill and away from the prevailing wind. The 1894 excavation reported that the huts nearest the entrance (save for Hut 12) were devoid of signs of human habitation, and were therefore used for livestock or storage, as was hut 2 at the opposite side of the compound. The huts range between 9 and 15 feet (2.7‚Äì4.5 metres) in diameter, with walls about 3 feet (1 metre) thick, made of upright granite slabs packed with an infill of rubble and possibly peat. Excavations at sites such as Holne Moor have shown that such huts had an interior plank lining.Chapman, 13. The hearth was variously located at the centre of the hut, or opposite the door. Ash from the hearths was found to be from oak and willow twigs. A lack of log remains and the presence of peat ash shows that by the time of Grimspound's occupation, the local forests had been replaced by enough peat buildup for it to be cut for fuel. Cooking holes contained granite pot boilers, pieces of stone heated in the fire and dropped into pots of water sunk into the ground (the pottery of the time not being fireproof).Chapman, 16. One of Grimspound's hut circles To the right of each hut entrance is a raised, level area, which the Committee called a \\"dais\\" and which was probably the sleeping area. Four of the huts (3, 7, 17 and 18) contain raised or upright stones, described as \\"anvil\\" stones, the purpose of which is unknown.Butler, 136‚Äì137. Unlike many similar sites on Dartmoor, there is no obviously larger hut that can be identified as a headman's dwelling, although the Committee did suggest that a pillar outside Hut 19 could have meant that the headman lived there.Butler, 131‚Äì132. =Other objects= The acidic soil of Dartmoor has destroyed nearly all organic material; it is therefore difficult to tell what Grimspound must have been like during its occupation. A flint arrowhead found nearby, and the lack of querns for grinding cereals, hint at some dependency on goods from outside the area (flint is not local to Dartmoor). The Exploration Committee also declared that the clay used in pottery fragments did not come from a local source.Chapman, 20.

The total array consists of 3 by 20√ó20 unit cells with overall dimensions of . A metamaterial (from the Greek word ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ meta, meaning \\"beyond\\" and the Latin word materia, meaning \\"matter\\" or \\"material\\") is any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. They are made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. The materials are usually arranged in repeating patterns, at scales that are smaller than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Metamaterials derive their properties not from the properties of the base materials, but from their newly designed structures. Their precise shape, geometry, size, orientation and arrangement gives them their smart properties capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves: by blocking, absorbing, enhancing, or bending waves, to achieve benefits that go beyond what is possible with conventional materials. Appropriately designed metamaterials can affect waves of electromagnetic radiation or sound in a manner not observed in bulk materials. Those that exhibit a negative index of refraction for particular wavelengths have been the focus of a large amount of research. These materials are known as negative-index metamaterials. Potential applications of metamaterials are diverse and include optical filters, medical devices, remote aerospace applications, sensor detection and infrastructure monitoring, smart solar power management, crowd control, radomes, high-frequency battlefield communication and lenses for high-gain antennas, improving ultrasonic sensors, and even shielding structures from earthquakes. Metamaterials offer the potential to create superlenses. Such a lens could allow imaging below the diffraction limit that is the minimum resolution that can be achieved by conventional glass lenses. A form of 'invisibility' was demonstrated using gradient-index materials. Acoustic and seismic metamaterials are also research areas. Metamaterial research is interdisciplinary and involves such fields as electrical engineering, electromagnetics, classical optics, solid state physics, microwave and antenna engineering, optoelectronics, material sciences, nanoscience and semiconductor engineering. History Explorations of artificial materials for manipulating electromagnetic waves began at the end of the 19th century. Some of the earliest structures that may be considered metamaterials were studied by Jagadish Chandra Bose, who in 1898 researched substances with chiral properties. Karl Ferdinand Lindman studied wave interaction with metallic helices as artificial chiral media in the early twentieth century. In the late 1940s, Winston E. Kock from AT&T; Bell Laboratories developed materials that had similar characteristics to metamaterials. In the 1950s and 1960s, artificial dielectrics were studied for lightweight microwave antennas. Microwave radar absorbers were researched in the 1980s and 1990s as applications for artificial chiral media. Bowers J. A.; Hyde R. A. et al. \\"Evanescent electromagnetic wave conversion lenses I, II, III\\" US Patent and Trademark Office, Grant US-9081202-B2, 14 juli 2015, Negative-index materials were first described theoretically by Victor Veselago in 1967. He proved that such materials could transmit light. He showed that the phase velocity could be made anti-parallel to the direction of Poynting vector. This is contrary to wave propagation in naturally occurring materials. In 2000, John Pendry was the first to identify a practical way to make a left- handed metamaterial, a material in which the right-hand rule is not followed. Such a material allows an electromagnetic wave to convey energy (have a group velocity) against its phase velocity. Pendry's idea was that metallic wires aligned along the direction of a wave could provide negative permittivity (dielectric function Œµ < 0). Natural materials (such as ferroelectrics) display negative permittivity; the challenge was achieving negative permeability (¬µ < 0). In 1999 Pendry demonstrated that a split ring (C shape) with its axis placed along the direction of wave propagation could do so. In the same paper, he showed that a periodic array of wires and rings could give rise to a negative refractive index. Pendry also proposed a related negative- permeability design, the Swiss roll. In 2000, David R. Smith et al. reported the experimental demonstration of functioning electromagnetic metamaterials by horizontally stacking, periodically, split-ring resonators and thin wire structures. A method was provided in 2002 to realize negative-index metamaterials using artificial lumped-element loaded transmission lines in microstrip technology. In 2003, complex (both real and imaginary parts of) negative refractive indexAIP News, Number 628 #1, March 13 Physics Today, May 2003, Press conference at APS March Meeting, Austin, Texas, March 4, 2003, New Scientist, vol 177, p. 24. and imaging by flat lens using left handed metamaterials were demonstrated. By 2007, experiments that involved negative refractive index had been conducted by many groups. At microwave frequencies, the first, imperfect invisibility cloak was realized in 2006. Electromagnetic metamaterials An electromagnetic metamaterial affects electromagnetic waves that impinge on or interact with its structural features, which are smaller than the wavelength. To behave as a homogeneous material accurately described by an effective refractive index, its features must be much smaller than the wavelength. For microwave radiation, the features are on the order of millimeters. Microwave frequency metamaterials are usually constructed as arrays of electrically conductive elements (such as loops of wire) that have suitable inductive and capacitive characteristics. Many microwave metamaterials use split-ring resonators. Photonic metamaterials are structured on the nanometer scale and manipulate light at optical frequencies. Photonic crystals and frequency-selective surfaces such as diffraction gratings, dielectric mirrors and optical coatings exhibit similarities to subwavelength structured metamaterials. However, these are usually considered distinct from metamaterials, as their function arises from diffraction or interference and thus cannot be approximated as a homogeneous material. However, material structures such as photonic crystals are effective in the visible light spectrum. The middle of the visible spectrum has a wavelength of approximately 560 nm (for sunlight). Photonic crystal structures are generally half this size or smaller, that is <280 nm. Plasmonic metamaterials utilize surface plasmons, which are packets of electrical charge that collectively oscillate at the surfaces of metals at optical frequencies. Frequency selective surfaces (FSS) can exhibit subwavelength characteristics and are known variously as artificial magnetic conductors (AMC) or High Impedance Surfaces (HIS). FSS display inductive and capacitive characteristics that are directly related to their subwavelength structure. Electromagnetic metamaterials can be divided into different classes, as follows: =Negative refractive index= A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal material Negative-index metamaterials (NIM) are characterized by a negative index of refraction. Other terms for NIMs include \\"left-handed media\\", \\"media with a negative refractive index\\", and \\"backward- wave media\\". NIMs where the negative index of refraction arises from simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability are also known as double negative metamaterials or double negative materials (DNG). Assuming a material well-approximated by a real permittivity and permeability, the relationship between permittivity \\\\epsilon_{r}, permeability \\\\mu_{r} and refractive index n is given by \\\\scriptstyle n =\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_\\\\mathrm{r}\\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{r}}. All known non-metamaterial transparent materials (glass, water, ...) possess positive \\\\epsilon_{r} and \\\\mu_{r}. By convention the positive square root is used for n. However, some engineered metamaterials have \\\\epsilon_{r} and \\\\mu_{r} < 0. Because the product \\\\epsilon_{r}\\\\mu_{r} is positive, n is real. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to take the negative square root for n. When both \\\\epsilon_{r} and \\\\mu_{r} are positive (negative), waves travel in the forward (backward) direction. Electromagnetic waves cannot propagate in materials with \\\\epsilon_{r} and \\\\mu_{r} of opposite sign as the refractive index becomes imaginary. Such materials are opaque for electromagnetic radiation and examples include plasmonic materials such as metals (gold, silver, ...). Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface. The foregoing considerations are simplistic for actual materials, which must have complex-valued \\\\epsilon_{r} and \\\\mu_{r}. The real parts of both \\\\epsilon_{r} and \\\\mu_{r} do not have to be negative for a passive material to display negative refraction.Voznesenskaya, A. and Kabanova, D. (2012) \\"Analysis of Ray Tracing Through Optical Systems with Metamaterial Elements\\", Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics, Volume 5, Number 12, p. 5. Indeed, a negative refractive index for circularly polarized waves can also arise from chirality. Metamaterials with negative n have numerous interesting properties: *Snell's law (n1sinŒ∏1 = n2sinŒ∏2) still describes refraction, but as n2 is negative, incident and refracted rays are on the same side of the surface normal at an interface of positive and negative index materials. *Cherenkov radiation points the other way. *The time-averaged Poynting vector is antiparallel to phase velocity. However, for waves (energy) to propagate, a ‚Äì¬µ must be paired with a ‚ÄìŒµ in order to satisfy the wave number dependence on the material parameters k c = \\\\omega\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu \\\\epsilon}. Negative index of refraction derives mathematically from the vector triplet E, H and k. For plane waves propagating in electromagnetic metamaterials, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, the reverse of the behavior of conventional optical materials. To date, only metamaterials exhibit a negative index of refraction. =Single negative= Single negative (SNG) metamaterials have either negative relative permittivity (Œµr) or negative relative permeability (¬µr), but not both. They act as metamaterials when combined with a different, complementary SNG, jointly acting as a DNG. Epsilon negative media (ENG) display a negative Œµr while ¬µr is positive. Many plasmas exhibit this characteristic. For example, noble metals such as gold or silver are ENG in the infrared and visible spectrums. Mu-negative media (MNG) display a positive Œµr and negative ¬µr. Gyrotropic or gyromagnetic materials exhibit this characteristic. A gyrotropic material is one that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field, enabling a magneto-optic effect. A magneto-optic effect is a phenomenon in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through such a medium. In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the polarization plane can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of such a reflection are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not to be confused with the nonlinear Kerr effect). Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations are called optical isomers. Joining a slab of ENG material and slab of MNG material resulted in properties such as resonances, anomalous tunneling, transparency and zero reflection. Like negative-index materials, SNGs are innately dispersive, so their Œµr, ¬µr and refraction index n, are a function of frequency. = Hyperbolic = Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) behave as a metal for certain polarization or direction of light propagation and behave as a dielectric for the other due to the negative and positive permittivity tensor components, giving extreme anisotropy. The material's dispersion relation in wavevector space forms a hyperboloid and therefore it is called a hyperbolic metamaterial. The extreme anisotropy of HMMs leads to directional propagation of light within and on the surface. HMMs have showed various potential applications, such as sensing, imaging, steering of optical signals, enhanced plasmon resonance effects. = Bandgap = Electromagnetic bandgap metamaterials (EBG or EBM) control light propagation. This is accomplished either with photonic crystals (PC) or left-handed materials (LHM). PCs can prohibit light propagation altogether. Both classes can allow light to propagate in specific, designed directions and both can be designed with bandgaps at desired frequencies. The period size of EBGs is an appreciable fraction of the wavelength, creating constructive and destructive interference. PC are distinguished from sub-wavelength structures, such as tunable metamaterials, because the PC derives its properties from its bandgap characteristics. PCs are sized to match the wavelength of light, versus other metamaterials that expose sub-wavelength structure. Furthermore, PCs function by diffracting light. In contrast, metamaterial does not use diffraction. PCs have periodic inclusions that inhibit wave propagation due to the inclusions' destructive interference from scattering. The photonic bandgap property of PCs makes them the electromagnetic analog of electronic semi-conductor crystals. EBGs have the goal of creating high quality, low loss, periodic, dielectric structures. An EBG affects photons in the same way semiconductor materials affect electrons. PCs are the perfect bandgap material, because they allow no light propagation. Each unit of the prescribed periodic structure acts like one atom, albeit of a much larger size. EBGs are designed to prevent the propagation of an allocated bandwidth of frequencies, for certain arrival angles and polarizations. Various geometries and structures have been proposed to fabricate EBG's special properties. In practice it is impossible to build a flawless EBG device. EBGs have been manufactured for frequencies ranging from a few gigahertz (GHz) to a few terahertz (THz), radio, microwave and mid- infrared frequency regions. EBG application developments include a transmission line, woodpiles made of square dielectric bars and several different types of low gain antennas. =Double positive medium= Double positive mediums (DPS) do occur in nature, such as naturally occurring dielectrics. Permittivity and magnetic permeability are both positive and wave propagation is in the forward direction. Artificial materials have been fabricated which combine DPS, ENG and MNG properties. =Bi-isotropic and bianisotropic= Categorizing metamaterials into double or single negative, or double positive, normally assumes that the metamaterial has independent electric and magnetic responses described by Œµ and ¬µ. However, in many cases, the electric field causes magnetic polarization, while the magnetic field induces electrical polarization, known as magnetoelectric coupling. Such media are denoted as bi-isotropic. Media that exhibit magnetoelectric coupling and that are anisotropic (which is the case for many metamaterial structures ), are referred to as bi-anisotropic. Four material parameters are intrinsic to magnetoelectric coupling of bi-isotropic media. They are the electric (E) and magnetic (H) field strengths, and electric (D) and magnetic (B) flux densities. These parameters are Œµ, ¬µ, Œ∫ and œá or permittivity, permeability, strength of chirality, and the Tellegen parameter, respectively. In this type of media, material parameters do not vary with changes along a rotated coordinate system of measurements. In this sense they are invariant or scalar. The intrinsic magnetoelectric parameters, Œ∫ and œá, affect the phase of the wave. The effect of the chirality parameter is to split the refractive index. In isotropic media this results in wave propagation only if Œµ and ¬µ have the same sign. In bi-isotropic media with œá assumed to be zero, and Œ∫ a non-zero value, different results appear. Either a backward wave or a forward wave can occur. Alternatively, two forward waves or two backward waves can occur, depending on the strength of the chirality parameter. In the general case, the constitutive relations for bi-anisotropic materials read \\\\mathbf{D} = \\\\epsilon \\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\xi \\\\mathbf{H}, \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\zeta \\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\mu \\\\mathbf{H}, where \\\\epsilon and \\\\mu are the permittivity and the permeability tensors, respectively, whereas \\\\xi and \\\\zeta are the two magneto-electric tensors. If the medium is reciprocal, permittivity and permeability are symmetric tensors, and \\\\xi=-\\\\zeta^T=-i \\\\kappa^T , where \\\\kappa is the chiral tensor describing chiral electromagnetic and reciprocal magneto-electric response. The chiral tensor can be expressed as \\\\kappa=\\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\kappa) I+N+J , where \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\kappa) is the trace of \\\\kappa , I is the identity matrix, N is a symmetric trace-free tensor, and J is an antisymmetric tensor. Such decomposition allows us to classify the reciprocal bianisotropic response and we can identify the following three main classes: (i) chiral media ( \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\kappa) eq 0, N eq 0, J=0 ), (ii) pseudochiral media ( \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\kappa) = 0, N eq 0, J=0 ), (iii) omega media ( \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\kappa) = 0, N = 0, J eq 0 ). =Chiral= Handedness of metamaterials is a potential source of confusion as the metamaterial literature includes two conflicting uses of the terms left- and right-handed. The first refers to one of the two circularly polarized waves that are the propagating modes in chiral media. The second relates to the triplet of electric field, magnetic field and Poynting vector that arise in negative refractive index media, which in most cases are not chiral. Generally a chiral and/or bianisotropic electromagnetic response is a consequence of 3D geometrical chirality: 3D-chiral metamaterials are composed by embedding 3D-chiral structures in a host medium and they show chirality-related polarization effects such as optical activity and circular dichroism. The concept of 2D chirality also exists and a planar object is said to be chiral if it cannot be superposed onto its mirror image unless it is lifted from the plane. 2D-chiral metamaterials that are anisotropic and lossy have been observed to exhibit directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection, absorption) of circularly polarized waves due to circular conversion dichrosim. On the other hand, bianisotropic response can arise from geometrical achiral structures possessing neither 2D nor 3D intrinsic chirality. Plum and colleagues investigated magneto-electric coupling due to extrinsic chirality, where the arrangement of a (achiral) structure together with the radiation wave vector is different from its mirror image, and observed large, tuneable linear optical activity, nonlinear optical activity, specular optical activity and circular conversion dichroism. Rizza et al. suggested 1D chiral metamaterials where the effective chiral tensor is not vanishing if the system is geometrically one-dimensional chiral (the mirror image of the entire structure cannot be superposed onto it by using translations without rotations). 3D-chiral metamaterials are constructed from chiral materials or resonators in which the effective chirality parameter \\\\kappa is non-zero. Wave propagation properties in such chiral metamaterials demonstrate that negative refraction can be realized in metamaterials with a strong chirality and positive \\\\epsilon_r and \\\\mu_r. This is because the refractive index n has distinct values for left and right circularly polarized waves, given by n = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r} \\\\pm \\\\kappa It can be seen that a negative index will occur for one polarization if \\\\kappa > \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r}. In this case, it is not necessary that either or both \\\\epsilon_r and \\\\mu_r be negative for backward wave propagation. A negative refractive index due to chirality was first observed simultaneously and independently by Plum et al. and Zhang et al. in 2009. = FSS based = Frequency selective surface-based metamaterials block signals in one waveband and pass those at another waveband. They have become an alternative to fixed frequency metamaterials. They allow for optional changes of frequencies in a single medium, rather than the restrictive limitations of a fixed frequency response. Other types = Elastic = These metamaterials use different parameters to achieve a negative index of refraction in materials that are not electromagnetic. Furthermore, \\"a new design for elastic metamaterials that can behave either as liquids or solids over a limited frequency range may enable new applications based on the control of acoustic, elastic and seismic waves.\\" They are also called mechanical metamaterials. = Acoustic = Acoustic metamaterials control, direct and manipulate sound in the form of sonic, infrasonic or ultrasonic waves in gases, liquids and solids. As with electromagnetic waves, sonic waves can exhibit negative refraction. Control of sound waves is mostly accomplished through the bulk modulus Œ≤, mass density œÅ and chirality. The bulk modulus and density are analogs of permittivity and permeability in electromagnetic metamaterials. Related to this is the mechanics of sound wave propagation in a lattice structure. Also materials have mass and intrinsic degrees of stiffness. Together, these form a resonant system and the mechanical (sonic) resonance may be excited by appropriate sonic frequencies (for example audible pulses). = Structural = Structural metamaterials provide properties such as crushability and light weight. Using projection micro-stereolithography, microlattices can be created using forms much like trusses and girders. Materials four orders of magnitude stiffer than conventional aerogel, but with the same density have been created. Such materials can withstand a load of at least 160,000 times their own weight by over-constraining the materials. A ceramic nanotruss metamaterial can be flattened and revert to its original state. = Nonlinear = Metamaterials may be fabricated that include some form of nonlinear media, whose properties change with the power of the incident wave. Nonlinear media are essential for nonlinear optics. Most optical materials have a relatively weak response, meaning that their properties change by only a small amount for large changes in the intensity of the electromagnetic field. The local electromagnetic fields of the inclusions in nonlinear metamaterials can be much larger than the average value of the field. Besides, remarkable nonlinear effects have been predicted and observed if the metamaterial effective dielectric permittivity is very small (epsilon-near-zero media). In addition, exotic properties such as a negative refractive index, create opportunities to tailor the phase matching conditions that must be satisfied in any nonlinear optical structure. = Hall metamaterials = In 2009, Marc Briane and Graeme Milton proved mathematically that one can in principle invert the sign of a 3 materials based composite in 3D made out of only positive or negative sign Hall coefficient materials. Later in 2015 Muamer Kadic et al. showed that a simple perforation of isotropic material can lead to its change of sign of the Hall coefficient. This theoretical claim was finally experimentally demonstrated by Christian Kern et al. In 2015, it was also demonstrated by Christian Kern et al. that an anisotropic perforation of a single material can lead to a yet more unusual effect namely the parallel Hall effect. This means that the induced electric field inside a conducting media is no longer orthogonal to the current and the magnetic field but is actually parallel to the latest. = Thermo-electric metamaterials = Frequency bands = Terahertz = Terahertz metamaterials interact at terahertz frequencies, usually defined as 0.1 to 10 THz. Terahertz radiation lies at the far end of the infrared band, just after the end of the microwave band. This corresponds to millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths between the 3 mm (EHF band) and 0.03 mm (long-wavelength edge of far-infrared light). = Photonic = Photonic metamaterial interact with optical frequencies (mid-infrared). The sub-wavelength period distinguishes them from photonic band gap structures. = Tunable = Tunable metamaterials allow arbitrary adjustments to frequency changes in the refractive index. A tunable metamaterial expands beyond the bandwidth limitations in left-handed materials by constructing various types of metamaterials. = Plasmonic = Plasmonic metamaterials exploit surface plasmons, which are produced from the interaction of light with metal- dielectrics. Under specific conditions, the incident light couples with the surface plasmons to create self-sustaining, propagating electromagnetic waves or surface waves known as surface plasmon polaritons.  Applications  Metamaterials are under consideration for many applications. Metamaterial antennas are commercially available. In 2007, one researcher stated that for metamaterial applications to be realized, energy loss must be reduced, materials must be extended into three-dimensional isotropic materials and production techniques must be industrialized. = Antennas = Metamaterial antennas are a class of antennas that use metamaterials to improve performance. Demonstrations showed that metamaterials could enhance an antenna's radiated power. Materials that can attain negative permeability allow for properties such as small antenna size, high directivity and tunable frequency. = Absorber = A metamaterial absorber manipulates the loss components of metamaterials' permittivity and magnetic permeability, to absorb large amounts of electromagnetic radiation. This is a useful feature for photodetection and solar photovoltaic applications. Loss components are also relevant in applications of negative refractive index (photonic metamaterials, antenna systems) or transformation optics (metamaterial cloaking, celestial mechanics), but often are not utilized in these applications. = Superlens = A superlens is a two or three-dimensional device that uses metamaterials, usually with negative refraction properties, to achieve resolution beyond the diffraction limit (ideally, infinite resolution). Such a behaviour is enabled by the capability of double-negative materials to yield negative phase velocity. The diffraction limit is inherent in conventional optical devices or lenses. = Cloaking devices = Metamaterials are a potential basis for a practical cloaking device. The proof of principle was demonstrated on October 19, 2006. No practical cloaks are publicly known to exist.Merritt, Richard (January 2009) \\"Next Generation Cloaking Device Demonstrated: Metamaterial renders object 'invisible'\\" = RCS (Radar Cross Section) reducing metamaterials = Conventionally, the RCS has been reduced either by Radar absorbent material (RAM) or by purpose shaping of the targets such that the scattered energy can be redirected away from the source. While RAMs have narrow frequency band functionality, purpose shaping limits the aerodynamic performance of the target. More recently, metamaterials or metasurfaces are synthesized that can redirect the scattered energy away from the source using either array theory or generalized Snell's law. This has led to aerodynamically favorable shapes for the targets with the reduced RCS. = Seismic protection = Seismic metamaterials counteract the adverse effects of seismic waves on man-made structures. = Sound filtering = Metamaterials textured with nanoscale wrinkles could control sound or light signals, such as changing a material's color or improving ultrasound resolution. Uses include nondestructive material testing, medical diagnostics and sound suppression. The materials can be made through a high-precision, multi-layer deposition process. The thickness of each layer can be controlled within a fraction of a wavelength. The material is then compressed, creating precise wrinkles whose spacing can cause scattering of selected frequencies. Theoretical models All materials are made of atoms, which are dipoles. These dipoles modify light velocity by a factor n (the refractive index). In a split ring resonator the ring and wire units act as atomic dipoles: the wire acts as a ferroelectric atom, while the ring acts as an inductor L, while the open section acts as a capacitor C. The ring as a whole acts as an LC circuit. When the electromagnetic field passes through the ring, an induced current is created. The generated field is perpendicular to the light's magnetic field. The magnetic resonance results in a negative permeability; the refraction index is negative as well. (The lens is not truly flat, since the structure's capacitance imposes a slope for the electric induction.) Several (mathematical) material models frequency response in DNGs. One of these is the Lorentz model, which describes electron motion in terms of a driven-damped, harmonic oscillator. The Debye relaxation model applies when the acceleration component of the Lorentz mathematical model is small compared to the other components of the equation. The Drude model applies when the restoring force component is negligible and the coupling coefficient is generally the plasma frequency. Other component distinctions call for the use of one of these models, depending on its polarity or purpose. Three-dimensional composites of metal/non-metallic inclusions periodically/randomly embedded in a low permittivity matrix are usually modeled by analytical methods, including mixing formulas and scattering-matrix based methods. The particle is modeled by either an electric dipole parallel to the electric field or a pair of crossed electric and magnetic dipoles parallel to the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, of the applied wave. These dipoles are the leading terms in the multipole series. They are the only existing ones for a homogeneous sphere, whose polarizability can be easily obtained from the Mie scattering coefficients. In general, this procedure is known as the \\"point-dipole approximation\\", which is a good approximation for metamaterials consisting of composites of electrically small spheres. Merits of these methods include low calculation cost and mathematical simplicity. Three conceptions- negative- index medium, non-reflecting crystal and super-lense are foundations of the metamaterial theory. Other first principles techniques for analyzing triply- periodic electromagnetic media may be found in Computing photonic band structure Institutional networks =MURI= The Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) encompasses dozens of Universities and a few government organizations. Participating universities include UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Imperial College in London. The sponsors are Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. MURI supports research that intersects more than one traditional science and engineering discipline to accelerate both research and translation to applications. As of 2009, 69 academic institutions were expected to participate in 41 research efforts. =Metamorphose= The Virtual Institute for Artificial Electromagnetic Materials and Metamaterials \\"Metamorphose VI AISBL\\" is an international association to promote artificial electromagnetic materials and metamaterials. It organizes scientific conferences, supports specialized journals, creates and manages research programs, provides training programs (including PhD and training programs for industrial partners); and technology transfer to European Industry.

Organisms living in this zone are called benthos and include microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and fungi) as well as larger invertebrates, such as crustaceans and polychaetes. Organisms here generally live in close relationship with the substrate and many are permanently attached to the bottom. The benthic boundary layer, which includes the bottom layer of water and the uppermost layer of sediment directly influenced by the overlying water, is an integral part of the benthic zone, as it greatly influences the biological activity that takes place there. Examples of contact soil layers include sand bottoms, rocky outcrops, coral, and bay mud. Description The benthic region of the ocean begins at the shore line (intertidal or littoral zone) and extends downward along the surface of the continental shelf out to sea. The continental shelf is a gently sloping benthic region that extends away from the land mass. At the continental shelf edge, usually about deep, the gradient greatly increases and is known as the continental slope. The continental slope drops down to the deep sea floor. The deep-sea floor is called the abyssal plain and is usually about deep. The ocean floor is not all flat but has submarine ridges and deep ocean trenches known as the hadal zone. For comparison, the pelagic zone is the descriptive term for the ecological region above the benthos, including the water-column up to the surface. Depending on the water-body, the benthic zone may include areas that are only a few inches below water, such as a stream or shallow pond; at the other end of the spectrum, benthos of the deep ocean includes the bottom levels of the oceanic abyssal zone. For information on animals that live in the deeper areas of the oceans see aphotic zone. Generally, these include life forms that tolerate cool temperatures and low oxygen levels, but this depends on the depth of the water. Organisms Benthos are the organisms that live in the benthic zone, and are different from those elsewhere in the water column. Many have adapted to live on the substrate (bottom). In their habitats they can be considered as dominant creatures, but they are often a source of prey for Carcharhinidae such as the lemon shark. Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column. The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one atmosphere for each 10 meters of water depth). Because light does not penetrate very deep into ocean-water, the energy source for the benthic ecosystem is often organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths. This dead and decaying matter sustains the benthic food chain; most organisms in the benthic zone are scavengers or detritivores. Some microorganisms use chemosynthesis to produce biomass. Benthic organisms can be divided into two categories based on whether they make their home on the ocean floor or a few centimeters into the ocean floor. Those living on the surface of the ocean floor are known as epifauna. Those who live burrowed into the ocean floor are known as infauna. Extremophiles, including piezophiles, which thrive in high pressures, may also live there. Nutrient flux Sources of food for benthic communities can derive from the water column above these habitats in the form of aggregations of detritus, inorganic matter, and living organisms. These aggregations are commonly referred to as marine snow, and are important for the deposition of organic matter, and bacterial communities. The amount of material sinking to the ocean floor can average 307,000 aggregates per m2 per day. This amount will vary on the depth of the benthos, and the degree of benthic-pelagic coupling. The benthos in a shallow region will have more available food than the benthos in the deep sea. Because of their reliance on it, microbes may become spatially dependent on detritus in the benthic zone. The microbes found in the benthic zone, specifically dinoflagellates and foraminifera, colonize quite rapidly on detritus matter while forming a symbiotic relationship with each other. Habitats Modern seafloor mapping technologies have revealed linkages between seafloor geomorphology and benthic habitats, in which suites of benthic communities are associated with specific geomorphic settings.Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K. 2012. \\"GEOHAB Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats ‚Äì synthesis and lessons learned\\", in: Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K. (eds.), Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 871-890. Examples include cold-water coral communities associated with seamounts and submarine canyons, kelp forests associated with inner shelf rocky reefs and rockfish associated with rocky escarpments on continental slopes.Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K.; 2012. Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats. Elsevier, Amsterdam, p. 947. In oceanic environments, benthic habitats can also be zoned by depth. From the shallowest to the deepest are: the epipelagic (less than 200 meters), the mesopelagic (200‚Äì1,000 meters), the bathyal (1,000‚Äì4,000 meters), the abyssal (4,000‚Äì6,000 meters) and the deepest, the hadal (below 6,000 meters). The lower zones are in deep, pressurized areas of the ocean. Human impacts have occurred at all ocean depths, but are most significant on shallow continental shelf and slope habitats.Harris, P. T., 2012. \\"Anthropogenic threats to benthic habitats\\", in: Harris, P. T.; Baker, E. K. (eds.), Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GeoHab Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 39-60. Many benthic organisms have retained their historic evolutionary characteristics. Some organisms are significantly larger than their relatives living in shallower zones, largely because of higher oxygen concentration in deep water.Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, news item March 2005 It is not easy to map or observe these organisms and their habitats, and most modern observations are made using remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), and rarely submarines. Ecological research Benthic macroinvertebrates have many important ecological functions, such as regulating the flow of materials and energy in river ecosystems through their food web linkages. Because of this correlation between flow of energy and nutrients, benthic macroinvertebrates have the ability to influence food resources on fish and other organisms in aquatic ecosystems. For example, the addition of a moderate amount of nutrients to a river over the course of several years resulted in increases in invertebrate richness, abundance, and biomass. These in turn resulted in increased food resources for native species of fish with insignificant alteration of the macroinvertebrate community structure and trophic pathways. The presence of macroinvertebrates such as Amphipoda also affect the dominance of certain types of algae in Benthic ecosystems as well. In addition, because benthic zones are influenced by the flow of dead organic material, there have been studies conducted on the relationship between stream and river water flows and the resulting effects on the benthic zone. Low flow events show a restriction in nutrient transport from benthic substrates to food webs, and caused a decrease in benthic macroinvertebrate biomass, which lead to the disappearance of food sources into the substrate. Because the benthic system regulates energy in aquatic ecosystems, studies have been made of the mechanisms of the benthic zone in order to better understand the ecosystem. Benthic diatoms have been used by the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) to establish ecological quality ratios that determined the ecological status of lakes in the UK. Beginning research is being made on benthic assemblages to see if they can be used as indicators of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Benthic assemblages in urbanized coastal regions are not functionally equivalent to benthic assemblages in untouched regions. Ecologists are attempting to understand the relationship between heterogeneity and maintaining biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Benthic algae has been used as an inherently good subject for studying short term changes and community responses to heterogeneous conditions in streams. Understanding the potential mechanisms involving benthic periphyton and the effects on heterogeneity within a stream may provide a better understanding of the structure and function of stream ecosystems. Benthic gross primary production (GPP) may be important in maintaining biodiversity hotspots in littoral zones in large lake ecosystems. However, the relative contributions of benthic habitats within specific ecosystems are poorly explored and more research is needed.

Dressel (October 14, 1943 ‚Äì March 24, 1992) was an Air Force pilot, and a Michigan politician in the 1970s and early 1980s. Although he was a conservative Republican, in 1983 he co-sponsored the state's first bill to protect gay and lesbian people from discrimination in employment and housing. He was profiled in Randy Shilts' book Conduct Unbecoming in the chapter \\"Heroes\\". Biography Dressel was born in Holland, Michigan, to German and Dutch parents, and raised in the United Methodist Church. He graduated from Hope College in 1967, then enlisted in the air force. Beginning in 1970, he served a tour of duty in the Vietnam War, piloting fighter jets and bombing enemy supply runs from a base in Thailand, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross and other decorations. Following his military service, he became a member of the Air National Guard and began a career in politics as a Republican. He was elected to the Ottawa County Commission, and served as county treasurer before being elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1978, serving the 95th District. Although he was a conservative Goldwater Republican, he cooperated with Democratic legislators on programs to aid the city of Detroit and other practical issues facing the state. He surprised his constituents in October 1983 by co-sponsoring House Bill 5000, an amendment to the state's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination based on \\"sexual orientation\\" in employment and housing. A 40-year-old bachelor, he was subsequently speculated to be gay, but refused at the time to confirm or deny it, citing the principle he was trying to demonstrate: that it shouldn't matter. He was soundly defeated in the Republican primary for re-election in 1984, by a candidate he had easily out-polled in the previous primary. He was later somewhat more open about his homosexuality, and became active in advocating civil rights protection for gay and lesbian people, including a stint leading the Michigan Organization for Human Rights. He died of AIDS- related pneumonia in 1992, at the age of 48. The Michigan Legislature passed a resolution honoring him upon his death.

Early life Born in Cornwall in 1975, Coode boarded at Papplewick School and Eton College. He studied marine biology at University of Newcastle upon Tyne and Keble College, Oxford, and rowed in the Oxford crew at the 1998 Boat Race. Career Coode won his first World Championship in 1999, as a substitute in the British men's coxless four, rowing with Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell. When Tim Foster returned to the four, Coode was put into the coxless pair with Greg Searle. They finished fourth at the 2000 Sydney Olympics having led for most of the race and being overtaken by three crews in the last 600 m, finishing 12/100th of a second (about 2 feet) out of third place. In 2001, he won a second World Championship in the men's coxless four with Steve Williams, Rick Dunn and Toby Garbett. In 2002, he missed the World Championships due to injury, Josh West taking his place in the coxless four, and was in the men's eight in 2003 that won the bronze at that year's world championships. With the injury to Alex Partridge, Coode was moved from the eight to the coxless four for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, rowing with Pinsent, Cracknell and Williams. In a close race with World champions Canada, they won gold.

It was constructed in 1969 by the Army Corps of Engineers, and is co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nez Perce Tribe. The hatchery is one of the largest combination producers of anadromous (migratory) fish in the world. These fish make a 1000-mile round trip to the ocean and back to spawn in the Clearwater River. The Dworshak Dam blocks access to the historical spawning areas on the North Fork-Clearwater River for the steelhead, and it is too high for a fish ladder. Steelhead, chinook and coho salmon are spawned and reared at the facility. The hatchery attempts to mitigate or make up for some of the lost spawning area by collecting mature adult fish, fertilizing their eggs, and raising them for 1‚Äì1¬Ω years, until they are large enough to begin their 500-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean. The young fish must survive a variety of hazards in the long journey, including swimming past eight dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. During the summer months the dams increase their water releases to aid fish migration downstream. The Dworshak hatchery is unique because of its ability to control the water temperature in the steelhead rearing ponds. By keeping the temperature at 54 degrees Fahrenheit, the juvenile steelheads are able to be released after one year at a length of 8 inches. In cold water, it would take an additional year to grow those same 8 inches. The hatchery accomplishes this through the recirculation of up to 90 percent of its water. The hatchery is part of Dworshak Fisheries Complex, which also includes Kooskia National Fish Hatchery, the Idaho Fish Health Center, and the Idaho Fisheries Resource Office. Dworshak National Fish Hatchery is open to visitors during daylight hours. The facility has a self- guided tour route and offers pre-arranged guided tours. The hatchery is located approximately three miles west of Orofino, ID on Highway 7. The best fish viewing seasons are: February - April for adult steelhead, June - August for adult chinook, and October - December for coho and steelhead. Dworshak Dam and Hatchery were named after Henry Dworshak, a Republican Senator from Idaho during 1946‚Äì1962.

The character was created by Peter O'Donnell in 1963 and, alongside Modesty Blaise, made his first appearance in the story La Machine, appearing for the first time in strip no. 21. Willie Garvin also appears in every volume of the Modesty Blaise book series.  Character background  Willie Garvin appears throughout the Modesty Blaise series as Modesty's confidant and right-hand man. His background is never presented in an ordered, chronological context, but rather in bits and pieces over the course of the comic strip, which ran from 1963 to 2002, and the literary series, which shared a more-or-less common continuity and ran from 1965 to 1996. What is known can be pieced together from the many tidbits revealed by O'Donnell over the years. Willie Garvin is British and has a rather shady background. He was born in Whitechapel to an unwed mother who died young, leaving him in the care of his \\"auntie\\"‚Äîan aged and alcoholic prostitute‚Äîwho \\"taught him how to duck.\\" He was then put in an orphanage which he ran away from after crossing a bully known as Dicer and losing his virginity to a girl nicknamed \\"Annie the Bang\\". He served in the French Foreign Legion, including the gruesome Battle of Dien Bien Phu, and later lived in Thailand, where he learned his skills as a Thai boxer. It is during his time as a Thai boxer in Saigon (or Bangkok, O'Donnell changed the story at some point) that he first meets Modesty Blaise, who despite being only twenty, runs a powerful (but moralistic) criminal organisation called The Network. Modesty sees Willie in one of his fights, and sees him getting arrested afterwards (\\"for the brawl he'd been involved in the night before\\"). Modesty buys him out of jail and tells him that she believes he is capable of being more of a man than he currently is. She tests him by having him collect money owed by a person in Hong Kong. This simple order gets so complicated that Willie actually has to break the man out of a prison in mainland China just to complete the mission. Modesty is astonished and impressed by Willie's ingenuity and so invites him to join The Network. Willie accepts and spends six months training with Modesty to the point where they trust each other as much as they trust themselves. Willie becomes Modesty's most trusted man in The Network, and stays on for six years until Modesty shuts the organisation down. Afterwards, the two remain close friends‚ÄîWillie opening a pub 25 miles (40 km.) from London called The Treadmill‚Äîand when Sir Gerald Tarrant offers Modesty a chance to put her skills to work on behalf of British Intelligence, she easily recruits Willie to fight by her side.  Character traits  Willie has a well-developed, if slightly dark, sense of humour, and often jokes about his and Modesty's lifestyles. He is given to quoting psalms, as he was once imprisoned for a year in Calcutta with only a psalter to read. Very sociable, he has a number of female acquaintances from all social levels (as Modesty humorously describes them, \\"from premier cru to honest vin de pays\\"), and is often reminded of anecdotes of them in the most unusual situations (such as when swimming in shark-infested waters or when hauling heavy objects up slopes). The one exception to his romantic conquests is Modesty Blaise; feeling that he owes her a debt greater than anything physical can offer, he refuses to consider her in a romantic light and Modesty, in return, reciprocates by treating Willie as her one trusted friend. Willie rarely refers to Modesty Blaise by her name; his preferred nickname for her is \\"Princess\\". On occasion, he literally provides a shoulder for her to cry on (one of Modesty's character traits is that she occasionally weeps following the conclusion of a particularly nasty mission). Willie Garvin is a tall and extremely strong man, though not heavily muscle-bound. He has a scar on his right hand made by a man named Suleiman, who was later killed by Modesty because he was torturing Willie. Like Modesty, he is a polymath of the first order: adept in safe-cracking and lock-picking, micro-electronics, expert at military tactics and a student of the criminal arts. He speaks several languages, including German, Spanish, Arabic and French; his English has a heavy cockney tone to it, though he is able to turn it on and off like a switch. Willie is a master knife thrower and can throw almost any object with extreme precision. He makes his own knives and is deadly with them at ranges up to 90 feet. He does not like pistols (because he thinks that guns give people too much confidence), and he and Modesty have also stated that he is a poor shot, but he has shown himself to be capable on the rare occasions that he uses such weapons. As an ex-soldier, he is skilled with rifles and submachine guns, and has on occasions also used a sniper rifle. Willie, like Modesty, has a strong sense of right and wrong that is governed more by his morals than by the law. Although he avoids using deadly force whenever possible, usually taking his cue from Modesty as to whether to fight \\"for keeps\\" (the duo's euphemism for killing), he will not hesitate to kill to protect Modesty (see, for example, the conclusion to the 1975 comic strip \\"Cry Wolf\\"). Willie and Modesty both smoke Gauloises (Sabre-tooth). I Had a Date with Lady Janet With one exception, all of the literary adventures of Modesty Blaise are told in the standard third person. The sole exception to this is the short story \\"I Had a Date with Lady Janet\\", which first appeared in the collection Pieces of Modesty. That story is told in first person from Willie Garvin's point of view. An audio-book of this story was narrated by John Thaw. Fate Although Willie Garvin continued to appear in the Modesty Blaise comic strip until O'Donnell retired in 2002 (actually he retired in 2001, but a book-length strip based upon one of his short stories subsequently appeared in a Scandinavian publication the next year), chronologically his final appearance comes in the closing story of the 1996 short story collection Cobra Trap. (This last story is also called \\"Cobra Trap,\\" like the book.) The story takes place a number of years into the future, with Modesty in her early fifties and Willie approximately 60 years of age. During a caper to protect a trainload of innocent people, including some children, from a group of rebels, Modesty suddenly kisses Willie romantically (for the first and only time) and reveals to him that she is dying of a brain tumor. She orders Willie to leave with the train, allowing her to die alone in battle against the rebels. Before he can react, Modesty is shot dead, and moments later, in a mortar attack, Willie's ankle is broken. Willie buries Modesty and then moves off slowly, hoping to escape through the jungle, but then Willie is also shot dead. As the story ends, O'Donnell describes Willie meeting Modesty in an ethereal environment, some kind of afterlife. Portrayals O'Donnell has said that he had Michael Caine in mind when he created Willie Garvin, and would have liked to see him portray him, but this never happened. Willie Garvin has been portrayed on film on a couple of occasions. Terence Stamp portrayed Willie Garvin in the 1966 film version of Modesty Blaise, a year after the publication of the first novel. In this film, Willie is portrayed as slightly psychotic when he first appears on screen. Later, the writers of the film choose to break O'Donnell's anti-romance taboo and have Willie and Modesty fall in love and even talk about getting married. Willie Garvin next appeared on screen in the 1982 television pilot Modesty Blaise with Ann Turkel as the title character, which was not made into a television series. In this version, Willie is portrayed by Lewis Van Bergen. Also in the early 1980s, John Thaw recorded an audio adaptation of I Had a Date with Lady Janet which he performed in character as Willie Garvin. One of the Modesty Blaise novels, Last Day in Limbo, was adapted as a BBC World Service radio drama in 1978 with James Bolam as Willie. Carl Prekopp played Willie in a 2012 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of A Taste for Death. In the 2014 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Modesty Blaise, he was played by Neil Maskell. The 2003 film My Name Is Modesty was produced as a prequel to the comic strip and novels; as such it is the only Modesty Blaise adventure in which Willie Garvin does not appear.

He was married to TV and radio presenter Beverley Turner, together they have three children. Cracknell was appointed OBE for \\"services to sport\\" in the 2005 New Year Honours List. Biography Cracknell began rowing whilst attending the independent Kingston Grammar School and rowed at the Junior World Championships in 1989 and 1990, winning a gold medal in 1990. He graduated from the University of Reading as a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Human Geography in 1993, followed by a PGCE at the Institute of Education and a Master of Science (MSc) from Brunel University in 1999.‚ÄòCRACKNELL, James Edward‚Äô, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Moving into the senior squad, Cracknell made numerous appearances in the World Rowing Championships; however, he did not win any medals prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics. He qualified in the double scull for the 1996 Games, but fell ill with tonsillitis and was unable to race. In 1997, he won a seat in the men's coxless fours, with Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and Tim Foster. With this crew, he won the World Rowing Championships in 1997, 1998 and 1999 (with Ed Coode replacing the injured Foster), and finally the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In August 2000, the month prior to winning gold in Sydney, he took part in a 3-part BBC documentary entitled Gold Fever. This followed the coxless four team in the years leading up to the Olympics, including video diaries recording the highs and lows in their quest for gold. With Redgrave then having retired, Cracknell swapped from rowing on strokeside to bowside to join Pinsent in the coxless pairs. The pair won the World Championships in 2001, when they also won the coxed pairs, and 2002. However, in 2003 a disappointing season was capped by a failure to win the World Championships, and Pinsent and Cracknell were shifted into the coxless four, with Steve Williams and Alex Partridge. Ed Coode replaced the injured Partridge in time for the 2004 Summer Olympics and this crew won the gold medal in Athens, beating world champions Canada by 0.08s. He came second in the pairs division of the 2005‚Äì2006 Atlantic Rowing Race in \\"Spirit of EDF Energy\\", partnered by Ben Fogle. Although they took first place in the line honours of the pairs event (overall, they were third to finish the race behind the two men's fours), the use of ballast water during the race resulted in the pair being moved to second position of the pairs event in accordance with the race rules. The event helped raise money for Children in Need. They made landfall in Antigua at 07.13 GMT on 19 January 2006, a crossing time of 49 days, 19 hours and 8 minutes. In February 2006, he announced his decision to retire from competitive rowing. Shortly after, Through Hell and High Water, a BBC/Twofour television programme of Cracknell and Fogle's experience of the Atlantic race, was aired. The pair wrote a book called The Crossing: Conquering the Atlantic in the World's Toughest Rowing Race, about their trip. On 4 March 2006, Cracknell's home was burgled: his Olympic gold medals were stolen, together with his wedding ring and a computer containing 20,000 words of a new book and family photographs. The gold medals were subsequently recovered by a neighbour's dog where the thief had discarded them. The thief, Mark Murphy, 30, was caught and jailed.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5221572.stm He ran the London Marathon on 23 April 2006, in a time of 3 hours, finishing over an hour ahead of his rowing teammate Matthew Pinsent. In January 2008 Cracknell set up Threshold Sports with Julian Mack and Charlie Beauchamp. In December 2008 he set off yet again with former teammate from the Atlantic Row, Ben Fogle, and Dr Ed Coats (the winner of a nationwide search), this time to take part in the inaugural Amundsen Omega3 South Pole Race. The team traversed the 473.6 miles suffering frostbite, infected blisters, dramatic weight-loss, pneumonia and exhaustion and came second only to a pair of Norwegians (over 20 hours). The BBC aired a 5 x 1-hour, prime-time Sunday night series of the adventure, On Thin Ice (Twofour), in June‚ÄìJuly 2009. The series was accompanied by a self- penned book of the race, Race to the Pole (MacMillan). In July 2008 Cracknell competed in the European Triathlon Championships for GBR for his age group and in November 2009 he took part in the New York Marathon. In April 2009, James completed the 125-mile non-stop Devizes to Westminster Canoe Marathon in a two-man racing K2 kayak with canoe partner Bernie Shosbree. James Cracknell at the London Triathlon 2007 In August 2009 Cracknell attempted to break the non- stop Land's End to John O'Groats mixed tandem world record along with Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Romero. The pair got just past Johnstone Bridge in Scotland before being forced to stop due to problems with Romero's knees. They were on course to break the record by over three hours. The attempt was to launch the 2010 Ride Across Britain that Cracknell's company organised In April 2010 Cracknell became the highest placed Briton ever in the 25-year history of the Marathon des Sables, finishing 12th. His exploits were filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary The Toughest Race on Earth to be aired in October 2010. This highest ever placing was beaten in 2013 by another Briton, Danny Kendall who finished 10th. Six months after his cycling accident which damaged his frontal lobe (see below), Cracknell competed in the Yukon Arctic Ultra. He finished second in the 430-mile race across the frozen Alaskan countryside, beaten only by British cyclist Alan Sheldon who beat Cracknell's 163:20 with his own 99:30. Cracknell's participation in the race was filmed for the documentary The Coldest Race on Earth aired on the Discovery Channel. He ran the 2012 London Marathon in just under three hours, one of the fastest celebrities, but behind Nell McAndrew. In 2018, Cracknell enrolled at Cambridge University to study for a MPhil degree in human evolution. On 7 April 2019, Cracknell became the oldest competitor, and oldest winner, for Cambridge in the 2019 Boat Race; at the age of 46 he became the oldest rower in the event's history by 10 years. In 2019, Cracknell participated in the seventeenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, where he was partnered with professional dancer Luba Mushtuk. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated from the show after losing the dance off to David James and Nadiya Bychkova. Presenting and journalism Cracknell has presented sport on ITV and Channel 4. He covered The Boat Race 2007 with Mark Durden-Smith for ITV and is the presenter of ITV's coverage of the British Superbike Championship. He is also the main presenter of Channel 4's Red Bull Air Race World Series coverage. He is a contracted columnist with The Daily Telegraph writing about various topics including sport, motoring, gardening, cookery and others. Politics A prominent supporter of the NOtoAV campaign in 2011 Alternative Vote referendum, Cracknell was announced, on 2 June 2013, as a Conservative Party candidate for South West England and Gibraltar in European Parliament election of 2014, but despite being placed third on the Conservative party list was not elected.  Charitable activities  From 27 February 2008 James Cracknell covered over 1,400 miles from Britain to Africa in 10 days, rowing, cycling and swimming. He rowed from Dover, England to Cap Gris Nez, France, then cycled to Tarifa, Spain, and finally swam across the Strait of Gibraltar from Tarifa to Punta Cires, Morocco. The comedian David Walliams joined him for the final part of his journey providing support from his previous experience of swimming the English Channel. The money raised by the challenge went towards the BBC's Sport Relief charity, with highlights of the action broadcast on 14 March. He was the celebrity guest at The WiG GiG which raise over ¬£10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support. In January 2009, James took part in the Amundsen Omega 3 South Pole Race with his TV presenter friend Ben Fogle and Dr Ed Coats as members of Team QinetiQ, finishing in second, 20 hours behind the winning Norwegian team. The race and the reasons behind was broadcast on BBC Television during summer 2009 in the series On Thin Ice. The trio raised funds for the children's medical research charity Sparks, chosen as the charity partner in memory of Cracknell's niece, Eva, who died at six days old after suffering oxygen deprivation at birth. On Saturday 3 October 2009, Cracknell and Ben Fogle started a 60-hour (estimated) journey from Edinburgh to London riding a rickshaw in support of SSAFA. They aimed to arrive in time for the Pride of Britain Awards ceremony on Monday 5 October 2009. They had to endure storm force gales in Scotland and Northumberland on their first day of the 450-mile ride. Early on the last day they made a stop at Etonbury Middle School in Arlesey, off the A1 road to London, where about 100 children welcomed them and to wave them on their way.  Cycling accident, helmet advocacy  On 20 July 2010, Cracknell suffered a hit from behind by a petrol tanker whilst cycling during an attempt to cycle, row, run and swim from Los Angeles to New York within 18 days. The accident happened at around 5.30am on a quiet stretch of road outside Winslow, Arizona. He has attributed his survival to the fact he was wearing a cycle helmet at the time. In the crash he suffered a contrecoup injury to the frontal lobes of his brain. In 2012 Cracknell and his wife wrote Touching Distance about his life before and after his brain injury, which has left him with epilepsy and a changed personality, including a short temper. Since the accident he has been conspicuous in advocating the use of bicycle helmets. Personal life In 2002, Cracknell married TV presenter Beverley Turner, with whom he lived in Chiswick. The couple had three children ‚Äì a son, Croyde (born October 2003), and two daughters, Kiki (born March 2009) and Trixie (born April 2011). They announced their separation on 29 March 2019 after 17 years of marriage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWj8g88Zaw Achievements * Olympic Medals: 2 Gold * World Championship Medals: 6 Gold * Junior World Championship Medals: 1 Gold =Olympic games= * 2004 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Four (with Matthew Pinsent, Steve Williams, Ed Coode) * 2000 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Four (with Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster, Steve Redgrave) =World championships= * 2003 ‚Äì 4th, Coxless Pair (with Matthew Pinsent) * 2002 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Pair (with Matthew Pinsent) * 2001 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Pair (with Matthew Pinsent) * 2001 ‚Äì Gold, Coxed Pair (with Matthew Pinsent, Neil Chugani) * 1999 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Four (with Matthew Pinsent, Ed Coode, Steve Redgrave) * 1998 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Four (with Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster, Steve Redgrave) * 1997 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Four (with Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster, Steve Redgrave) * 1995 ‚Äì 10th, Double Sculls * 1994 ‚Äì 8th, Eight * 1993 ‚Äì 6th, Eight * 1991 ‚Äì 7th, Coxless Four (with John Garrett, Gavin Stewart, James Walker) =Junior world championships= * 1990 ‚Äì Gold, Coxless Four * 1989 ‚Äì 10th, Coxed Pair =Boat Race= * 2019 - The Boat Race, rowing for the University of Cambridge =World Records= * 2020 - British Indoor Rowing Marathon Record for Heavyweight 40-49 Men  Styles  * James Cracknell (1972‚Äì2001) * James Cracknell, MBE (2001‚Äì2004) * James Cracknell, OBE (2004-date) = National honour = * 45px Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) References External links * James Cracknell's personal website * Atlantic Rowing Race * Amundsen Omega 3 South Pole Race * James Cracknell's column archiveTelegraph.co.uk * Gold Fever at bbc.co.uk * BBC Woman's Hour interview with James' wife, Beverley Turnerbbc.co.uk * James Cracknell at www.standard.co.uk Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:English male rowers Category:People educated at Kingston Grammar School Category:Alumni of the University of Reading Category:Alumni of the UCL Institute of Education Category:Alumni of Brunel University London Category:English Olympic medallists Category:Olympic gold medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic rowers of Great Britain Category:Rowers at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Members of Leander Club Category:Olympic medalists in rowing Category:People with traumatic brain injuries Category:Conservative Party (UK) politicians Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:British sportsperson-politicians Category:Conservative Party (UK) people Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Rowers from Greater London Category:World Rowing Championships medalists for Great Britain Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics ","title":"James Cracknell"},{"id":"906925","text":"Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril (January 1, 1774 ‚Äì August 14, 1860) was a French zoologist. He was professor of anatomy at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle from 1801 to 1812, when he became professor of herpetology and ichthyology. His son Auguste Dum√©ril was also a zoologist.  Life  Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril was born on January 1, 1774, in Amiens, and died on August 14, 1860, in Paris. He became a doctor at a young age, obtaining, at 19 years, the pr√©vot of anatomy at the medical school of Rouen. In 1800, he left for Paris and collaborated in the drafting of the comparative anatomy lessons of Georges Cuvier. He replaced Cuvier at the Central School of the Panth√©on and had, as his colleague, Alexandre Brongniart. In 1801, he gave courses to the medical school of Paris. Under the Restauration, he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences (French Academy of Sciences) and after 1803 succeeded Lac√©p√®de, who was occupied by his political offices, as professor of herpetology and ichthyology at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. Dum√©ril only officially received this chair in 1825, after the death of Lac√©p√®de. He published his Zoologie analytique in 1806. This covered the whole of the animal kingdom and shows the relations between genera as then distinguished, but not among species. In 1832, Gabriel Bibron (1806‚Äì1848), who became his assistant, was given the task of describing the species for an expanded version of Zoologie analytique, while Nicolaus Michael Oppel (1782‚Äì1820) assisted him with a revised higher-order systematics. After the death of Bibron, he was replaced by Auguste Dum√©ril, Andr√©'s son. However, Bibron's death delayed the publication of the new work for 10 years. In 1851, the two Dum√©rils, father and son, published the Catalogue m√©thodique de la collection des reptiles (although Auguste was apparently the true author) and in 1853, Andr√© Dum√©ril alone published Prodrome de la classification des reptiles ophidiens. This last book proposes a classification of all the snakes in seven volumes. Dum√©ril, upon discovering a case of preserved fishes in the attic of the house of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, finally described the species that had been collected by Philibert Commerson nearly 70 years earlier. He then published a very important work, l‚ÄôErp√©tologie g√©n√©rale ou Histoire naturelle compl√®te des reptiles (nine volumes, 1834‚Äì1854). In this, 1,393 species are described in detail and their anatomy, physiology, and bibliography are specified. However, Dum√©ril maintained the amphibians among the reptiles in spite of the work of Alexandre Brongniart or Pierre Andr√© Latreille or the anatomical discoveries of Karl Ernst von Baer (1792‚Äì1876) and Johannes Peter M√ºller (1801‚Äì1858). He was interested all his life in the insects and published several memoirs on entomology. His principal entomological work is Entomologie analytique (1860, two volumes). With his son Auguste, also a zoologist, he created the first vivarium for reptiles of the Jardin des Plantes. Dum√©ril always considered observations on animal behaviour of taxonomic significance. After 1853, he began to cede his position to his son and he retired completely in 1857. He was made a commander of the Legion of Honour two months before his death. Species named after A.M.C.

Unamuno scholars such as J.A.G. Ardila, have contended that Mist was inspired by the Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard's work Diary of a Seducer, a novella in Either/Or.The Origin of Unamuno's Mist: Unamuno's Copy of Kierkegaard's Diary of the Seducer Plot summary The plot revolves around the character of Augusto, a wealthy, intellectual and introverted young man. He falls in love with a young woman named Eugenia as she walks past him on the street, and he sets about trying to court her. He is aided in his efforts by the other members of Eugenia's household. Her Aunt Ermelinda is particularly keen for a relationship to evolve, so that Augusto might help with her niece's financial troubles. Nevertheless, Eugenia rejects his advances, since she is already in a relationship with the down-and-out Mauricio. Augusto pays off Eugenia's mortgage as a goodwill gesture without her knowing, but this only serves to insult Eugenia, rather than endear him to her. In the meantime, Augusto becomes involved with another girl, Rosario, and he begins to question if he is really in love with Eugenia at all. After talking with various friends and acquaintances, Augusto decides he will propose to Eugenia in any case. To his surprise, Eugenia accepts the engagement. A few days before the marriage is to occur, Augusto receives a letter from Eugenia. The letter explained that she was leaving him for Mauricio. Augusto, heartbroken, decides to kill himself. Because everything Augusto does involves a lengthy thought process, he decides that he needs to consult Unamuno himself (the author of the novel), who had written an article on suicide which Augusto had read. When Augusto speaks with Unamuno, the truth is revealed that Augusto is actually a fictional character whom Unamuno has created. Augusto is not real, Unamuno explains, and for that reason cannot kill himself. Augusto asserts that he exists, even though he acknowledges internally that he doesn't, and threatens Unamuno by telling him that he is not the ultimate author. Augusto reminds Unamuno that he might be just a character in one of God's dreams. Augusto returns to his home and dies. Whether or not he is killed by Unamuno or commits suicide is a subject of debate and is mostly down to the reader's opinion. The book ends with the author himself debating himself about bringing back the character of Augusto. He establishes, however, that this would not be feasible. The eulogy is given by Orfeo, Augusto's dog. The title, Spanish for 'fog', is a reference to how Augusto sees his life. Augusto describes his world as full of small and almost imperceptible occurrences, some of them good, some of them bad, that all serve to obscure his vision.

According to Centuri's Joel Hochberg, the game was licensed from \\"a smaller Japanese developer.\\" Amstar Electronics (which was located in Phoenix, Arizona)p. 163, Racing the beam: the Atari Video computer system, by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost, MIT Press, 2009, . licensed the game to Centuri for manufacture in the United States. Taito released the game in Japan. Atari, Inc. released a port of Phoenix for the Atari 2600 in 1982. The Phoenix mothership is one of the first video arcade game bosses to be presented as a separate challenge.Sterbakov, Hugh. (2008-03-05) The 47 Most Diabolical Video- Game Villains of All Time. Gamepro. Retrieved on 2008-04-28. This was before the term boss was coined.  Gameplay  Arcade screenshot The player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, firing upward. Enemies, typically one of two types of birds, appear on the screen above the player's ship, shooting at it and periodically diving towards it in an attempt to crash into it. The ship is equipped with a shield that can be used to zap any of the alien creatures that attempt to crash into it. The player cannot move while the shield is active and must wait approximately five seconds before using it again. The player starts with three or six lives, depending on the settings. One life is lost whenever the ship is hit by any enemy or projectile while the shield is down. Each level has five separate rounds. The player must complete a round to advance to the next. * Rounds 1 and 2 ‚Äì The player must destroy a formation of alien birds. While in formation, some of the birds fly down kamikaze style, in an attempt to destroy the player's spaceship by crashing into it. Hitting a birdlike enemy flying diagonally awards a bonus score. The birdlike enemies are yellow in round 1, and pink in round 2. The player's spaceship is given rapid fire for round 2, where the birdlike creatures fly somewhat more unpredictably. * Rounds 3 and 4 ‚Äì Flying eggs float on the screen and seconds later hatch, revealing larger alien birds, resembling phoenices, which swoop down at the player's spaceship. The only way to fully destroy one of these birdlike creatures is by hitting it in its belly; shooting one of its wings merely destroys that wing, and if both wings are destroyed, they will regenerate. From time to time the birdlike creatures may also revert to the egg form for a brief period. The birdlike creatures are blue in round 3, and pink in round 4. * Round 5 ‚Äì The player is pitted against the mothership, which is controlled by an alien creature sitting in its center. To complete this round, the player must create a hole in the conveyor belt-type shield to get a clear shot at the alien. Hitting the alien with a single shot ends the level and scores 400-8,200 points. The mothership fires missiles at the player's ship, moves slowly down towards it, and has alien birds (from rounds 1 and 2) protecting it. Defeating all of the birds will produce a new wave. The game continues with increasing speed and unpredictability of the birdlike creature and phoenix flights. Development = Hardware = An officially-licensed Italian arcade cabinet of Phoenix, manufactured by Amtec in 1981 Phoenix was available in both arcade and cocktail cabinets. A DIP switch setting allows the game to be moved between formats. Most Phoenix games are in a standard Centuri woodgrain cabinet, but several other cabinets exist, due to this game being sold by multiple companies at the same time. These use sticker sideart (which covers the upper half of the machine), and glass marquees. The control panel is made up entirely of buttons; no joystick is present in the Centuri version, except for the international models and some cocktail versions. The monitor in this machine is mounted vertically, and the monitor bezel is relatively unadorned. Phoenix uses a unique wiring harness, which isn't known to be compatible with any other games. Circuitry in the Centuri version: * CPU: 8085 at 5.5 MHz. * RAM: 4 kB (8 2114 1k x 4 chips.) * ROM: 16 kB (8 2716 2k x 8 chips.) * Audio: Matsushita MN6221AA chip, along with discrete circuitry. * Video: discrete circuitry, utilizing 4 more 2716 2k x 8 EPROMs, as well as 2 256 x 4 bipolar PROMs.Phoenix service manual, Centuri, Inc., #364-62-0100 A. =Music= There are two pieces of music featured in the game: * Romance de Amor also known as Spanish Romance by an unknown composer. * F√ºr Elise by Beethoven. Both songs are built directly into the Matsushita MN6221AA Melody IC, as opposed to being programmed into the game's code as is standard in games. In some bootleg versions of the game, which used the namco galaxian Board, House of the rising sun is played at the start of the game. =Bugs= When the player shoots three birdlike enemies in a row very quickly as they fly upwards, the total score is set to a value in the vicinity of 204,000 points. Reception Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz of Electronic Games called Phoenix \\"perhaps the finest invasion title ever produced for the 2600!\\", praising its \\"fantastic graphics, unexcelled play-action and more\\". The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"1984 Best Science Fiction/ Fantasy Videogame\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. In a retrospective review by Brett Alan Weiss (AllGame) the game was awarded a five out of five rating, referring to it as a \\"one of the most impressive games the \\"slide-and-shoot\\" genre has to offer, bested only by Galaga in terms of sheer enjoyment and replayability\\" and concluded that \\"Finely balanced shooting action combined with colorfully animated graphics make Phoenix a true classic among shooters.\\" Legacy =Re- releases= In 2005, Phoenix was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, PSP and Microsoft Windows as part of Taito Legends in the US and Europe, and Taito Memories II Gekan in Japan. = Clones = * Griffon, Videotron in 1980. * Falcon was released by BGV. in 1980. * Vautour was released by Jeutel in 1980 in France. * Condor was released by Sidam in 1981. * Pheenix was released by Megadodo for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. * Eagle Empire was released by Alligata for the BBC Micro in 1983.

Amur military flotilla (AMF) () was a military flotilla on the Amur River in the Far East region of Russia. History In 1900, the Russians formed a temporary flotilla on the Amur river out of private steamers and barges. Initially, it served transportation purposes during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì5. Officially, the AMF was created in July 1906 for the purpose of defending the border line of the Amur basin and securing water communication on the Amur river. In 1910, the AMF comprised 28 units, including eight turret gunboats and ten smaller gunboats. In December 1917, they formed the Soviet Amur military flotilla, which would take part in the Russian Civil War. In 1918, the AMF was captured by the Japanese, who took away almost all of the ships in May 1920. With the end of the Civil War in the Far East, the Soviets began reconstruction of the flotilla. In 1925‚Äì6, it grew bigger with the return of the ships, taken away by the Japanese. In 1929, the AMF included four river monitors and other ships. In 1930, the AMF was awarded with the Order of the Red Banner for its successful military operations during the Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929.

Description A fur seal grooming itself at the Cape Cross Seal Reserve on the Skeleton Coast Skull of male brown fur seal The brown fur seal is the largest and most robust member of the fur seals. It has a large and broad head with a pointed snout that may be flat or turned up slightly. They have external ear flaps (pinnae) and their whiskers (vibrissae) are long, and may extend backward past the pinnae, especially in adult males. The fore flippers are covered with sparse hair over about three-quarters of their length. The hind flippers are short relative to the large body, with short, fleshy tips on the digits. The size and weight of the brown fur seal depends on the subspecies. The Southern African subspecies is on average slightly larger than the Australian subspecies. Males of the African subspecies (A. p. pusillus) are in length on average and weigh . Females are smaller, averaging in length and typically weighing .King, J. 1983. Seals of the World. Ithaca, New York: Comstock Publishing Associates. Males of the Australian subspecies (A. p. doriferus) are in length and weigh . Females are length and weigh . Adult male brown fur seals are dark gray to brown, with a darker mane of short, coarse hairs and a light belly, while adult females are light brown to gray, with a light throat and darker back and belly. The fore flippers of the fur seal are dark brown to black. Pups are born black and molt to gray with a pale throat within 3-5 months. The skull of the African subspecies has a larger crest between the mastoid process and the jugular process of the exoccipital. Ecology Baby seal A fur seal colony at Duiker Island, South Africa Fur seal underwater at Agulhas Bank Cape Cross colony, Namibia The African fur seal lives around the southern and southwestern coast of Africa from Cape Cross in Namibia and around the Cape of Good Hope to Black Rocks near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape province. The Australian fur seal lives in Bass Strait, at four islands off Victoria in southeastern Australia, and five islands off Tasmania. Brown fur seals prefer to haul out and breed on rocky islands, rock ledges and reefs, and pebble and boulder beaches. However, some large colonies can be found on sandy beaches. Fur seals spend most of the year at sea, but are never too far from land. They have been recorded 160 km from land, but this is not common. The African fur seal's diet is made of up to 70% fish, 20% squid, and 2% crab.Schliemann, H. 1990. Eared Seals and Walruses. Pp. 168‚Äì203 in B. Grzimek, ed. Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals. New York: McGraw-Hill. Also eaten are other crustaceans, cephalopods and sometimes birds. In rare instances, they have even been documented attacking and eating sharks. A recent incident occurred off Cape Point, South Africa, where a large male was observed attacking and killing five blue sharks between 1.0 and 1.4 m long. Observers concluded that the seal likely killed the sharks to eat the fish-rich contents of their stomachs, as well as their livers as a source of energy. The Australian fur seal mostly eats squid, octopus, fish, and lobsters. The brown fur seal dives for its food. The African subspecies can dive as deep as 204 m and for as long as 7.5 minutes.Riedman, M. 1990. The Pinnipeds: Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses. Berkeley: University of California Press. The Australian subspecies generally feeds at lower depths, diving on average 120 m and can reach as deep as 200 m. The brown fur seal's main predator is the great white shark, although they are also preyed upon by various other animals, such as killer whales and vagrant southern elephant seals. Land-based predators include black-backed jackals and brown hyenas on the Skeleton Coast in Namibia. In False Bay, the seals employ a number of antipredatory strategies while in shark-infested waters, such as: *Swimming in large groups and harassing sharks in the vicinity *Low porpoising to increase subsurface vigilance *Darting in different directions to cause confusion when attacked *Using their greater agility to stay out of reach *Riding near the dorsal fin to keep out of reach of the shark's jaws when attackedAnti- Predatory Strategies of Cape Fur Seals at Seal Island Behaviour Friar Islands, Tasmania Brown fur seals in Cape Cross Suckling =Acoustic behavior= Australian fur seals are social animals that use vocalizations in a broad range of contexts. These vocalizations have been shown to contain individually unique properties important for enabling individual recognition. This is particularly important for the reunion of mothers and pups that experience repeated separations whilst mothers are out at sea foraging, sometimes for days at a time. Upon their return, mothers need to locate their pups. This reunion process may also be facilitated through a combination of smell and spatial cues. In males, increases in testosterone and calling rates are seen in conjunction with the onset of the breeding season. Males can also differentiate neighboring males from stranger males, responding more aggressively to the vocalizations of strangers. This difference in response is suspected because the threat posed by a stranger is unknown and potentially greater than their neighbor, which they would have previously encountered while establishing their territories. =Breeding behaviour= Brown fur seals often gather into colonies on rookeries in numbers ranging from 500‚Äì1500, at least for the Australian subspecies. While fur seals spend most of the year at sea, they never fully evacuate the rookeries, as mothers and pups return to them throughout the year. No dispersal from a colony is established, although some fur seals from one colony have been found at another. True boundaries do not exist between the colonies. When at sea, they travel in small feeding groups. Brown fur seals begin to breed in the middle of October, when males haul out on shore to establish territories though display, vocalisations, sparring, and sometimes actual combat . They fast at this time and do not eat until after mating in November or December. When the females arrive, they fight among themselves for territories in which to give birth. Female territories are smaller than those of males and are always located within them. Females within a male's territory can be considered part of his harem. However, males do not herd the females, which are free to choose their mates and judge them based on the value of their territories. For the Australian fur seals, 82% of copulations are performed by males whose territories are located directly at the water's edge. Copulation between the male and his females begins 6 days after they give birth to their pups conceived from the previous year. However, a delay occurs in the implantation of the blastocyst, which lasts 4 months in the African subspecies and 3 months in the Australian subspecies. Gestation for the brown fur seal typically lasts a year less a few days. After mating, females begin alternating brief periods of foraging at sea with several days ashore nursing their pups. Foraging trips last about 7 days in winter and about 4 days in summer and autumn. When a mother returns from sea to feed her pup, she emits a loud call which attracts all the nearby pups, but she only responds to her pup. She possibly can recognize her pup by smell. When left alone, pups gather in groups and play during the evening. Pups are usually weaned at 4‚Äì6 months old. Human interactions Fur seals used for tourist attraction in Namibia Gaston in Prague Zoo This species is an inquisitive and friendly animal when in the water, and often accompanies scuba divers. They swim around divers for periods of several minutes at a time, even at a depth of 60 m. On land, they are far less relaxed and tend to panic when humans come near them. Australian fur seals were hunted intensively between 1798 and 1825 for commercial reasons. Seal hunting stopped in Australia in 1923, and their population is still recovering, causing increasing friction with South Australian fishermen as their range expands. Breeding and haul-out sites are protected by law. South African fur seals have a very robust and healthy population. Harvesting of seals was outlawed in South Africa in 1990. Brown fur seals are still harvested in Namibia. Permits are issued for the killing of pups for their luxurious fur and adult males for their genitalia, which are considered an aphrodisiac in some countries. It is also considered necessary to limit seal numbers in Namibia because of the supposed effect seals have on the country's fish harvest.

From 1995 to 1998 he was a member of Australia's prominent world class crew ‚Äì the coxless four known as the Oarsome Foursome.  Club and state rowing  Ginn was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne where he took up rowing. His senior club rowing was done from the Mercantile Rowing Club in Melbourne. His first state selection for Victoria came in the 1993 youth eight contesting the Noel Wilkinson Trophy in the Interstate Regatta at the Australian Rowing Championships. He rowed again in the Victorian youth eight in 1994, this time to victory in the Interstate Regatta. On twelve occasions between 1995 and 2008 he was selected in the Victorian senior men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. Eight of those Victorian eights saw King's Cup victories and Ginn stroked three King's Cup eights, two to victory.  National representative rowing  Ginn made his Australian representative debut in the 1994 U23 Trans Tasman series against New Zealand. He rowed in the Australian eight which won two of the three match races in the series. In 1994 he also contested the World Rowing U23 Championships in Paris rowing in the men's eight. In 1995 he first contested senior World Rowing Championships rowing in the men's eight to an eleventh placing in Tampere, Finland. Ginn won gold in the men's coxless four at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics as part of Australia's Oarsome Foursome, along with Mike McKay, James Tomkins, and Nicholas Green ‚Äì Ginn replaced the retired Andrew Cooper. In 1997 he secured a seat in the Australian men's senior eight. He raced at the World Rowing Cup I in Lucerne that year and then at the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France he rowed in the seven seat for their third placing in the final and to a bronze medal. Ginn's 1997 season in the Australian eight also included a campaign at the Henley Royal Regatta where as an Australian Institute of Sport crew they contested and won the 1997 Grand Challenge Cup. At the 1998 World Championships, back in the Oarsome Foursome Ginn raced and won the men's coxed four world title with Brett Hayman in the stern. Mike McKay and Ginn also took a silver medal at that same regatta as a coxless pair. In 1999, the foursome would go on to try out, but lose the 1999 Australian selection trials in a coxless four. Tomkins and Ginn decided to switch to a coxless pair and won the 1999 World Championship in St Catharines Canada. Ginn and James Tomkins had planned to race the straight pair at the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics, but Ginn suffered a severe back injury, forcing him to withdraw from the boat.Ginn at World Rowing In 2002, he returned to the water, teaming up with fellow Oarsome Foursome rower James Tomkins in a coxless pair; they finished fourth in the 2002 World Championships. In 2003, Ginn and Tomkins were the surprise winners, beating the British favourites‚Äîand defending champions‚ÄîMatthew Pinsent and James Cracknell, which was a factor in Pinsent and Cracknell choosing to move to the coxless fours. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Ginn and Tomkins won the gold medal in the coxless pairs. In 2006, Ginn made a return to international competition at the 2006 World Rowing Championships held at Dorney Lake, Eton. He and new pairs partner Duncan Free were able to win despite choppy tail conditions. In 2007 Ginn and Free successfully defended their coxless pairs title, posting a time of 6:24.87 minutes ‚Äî almost 6 secs ahead of their New Zealand rivals (Nathan Twaddle and George Bridgewater) who had stuck with them for the first 1000 m before dropping behind to take the silver. Early in 2008 Drew Ginn and his 2007 World Champion partner Free, were pre-selected to compete for Australia at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games where they won the gold medal as a coxless pair. At the 2012 London Olympics, Ginn won a silver medal in the Australian men's coxless four, behind the all-conquering Great Britain men's four, who went on to win gold in their fourth consecutive Olympics. Cycling career In 2009 Ginn took up competitive road bicycle racing, with immediate success, particularly in the discipline of the time trial. He won the 2009 Oceania time trial championships. However, in downplaying the achievement, Ginn noted two riders in the under-23 competition actually posted faster times over the same course on the same day. In a much stronger field at the 2010 Australian national road championships, Ginn finished sixth. Accolades Ginn was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the 1997 Australia Day Honours and the Australian Sports Medal in June 2000. Scotch College, Melbourne, Ginn's former school, named a racing eight \\"Drew Ginn\\" in his honour. The school's first VIII won the APS Head of the River (Australia) in that boat in 1998. In 2003 together with James Tomkins he was named with FISA male rower of the year. In 2004 he was appointed as an Athletes Commission member to the Australian Olympic Committee. In 2007 jointly with Duncan Free he was named FISA male rower of the year. In 2010, Ginn was inducted as a member of the Rowing Victoria Hall of Fame. In 2014, the International Rowing Federation awarded Ginn the Thomas Keller Medal for his outstanding international rowing career. It is the sport's highest honour and is awarded within five years of the athlete's retirement, acknowledging an exceptional rowing career and exemplary sportsmanship. In October 2018, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

He worked with Fluide Glacial magazine from 1995 to 2006 and with Spirou magazine from 1997 to 2004. He has also founded the French publisher Les R√™veurs in 1998. Since 2000, he mostly works with Dargaud. Biography Emmanuel Larcenet, also known as Manu Larcenet, was born in Issy-les- Moulineaux, Hauts-de-Seine, France. He studied graphic art at the S√®vres lyc√©e and then went on to art school. While spending time as a singer in a punk-rock band, he published his first drawings in comics and rock fanzines. In October 1994, he was published in the French magazine Fluide Glacial (issue #220) with L'Expert comptable de la jungle, a first story rapidly followed by other complete ones, and republished later in comic books, in the series Soyons fous, La Loi des s√©ries and Bill Baroud. Meanwhile, Larcenet was also actively working for \\"Les r√™veurs de runes\\". For this magazine and label specialising in fantasy, he created games called Raoul, D'ac Raoul, and, in 1997, Dallas cowboy. From that year on, alone first and then with Gaudelette, he worked for Spirou magazine, publishing Pedro le Coati, among others. In 1998, still for Dupuis but with Jean-Michel Thiriet, he created La vie est courte. His other drawings were independently collected and published in 1996 and 1998 in 30 millions d'imb√©ciles and Ni dieu, ni ma√Ætre, ni croquettes by Gl√©nat. In 2000, he met Guy Vidal who would become responsible for the label Poisson Pilote at Dargaud. He became friends with him and started contributing to the Poisson Pilote label, drawing Les cosmonautes du futur based on a script by Lewis Trondheim, and later on Les Entremondes with his brother Patrice Larcenet. In June 2001, he left Paris for Lyon, keeping contact with Vidal. On a scenario by Jean-Yves Ferri, he participated in Le retour √† la terre. Finally, he signed alone his next books : the Une aventure rocambolesque de..., Le combat ordinaire (this last one being granted an award by the Prize for Best Album at the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival) and Nic Oumouk series.

Laplace's name is sometimes applied to the invariable plane, which is the plane perpendicular to a system's mean angular momentum vector, but the two should not be confused.Scott Tremaine, Jihad Touma, and Fathi Namouni (2009). \\"Satellite dynamics on the Laplace surface\\", The Astronomical Journal 137, 3706‚Äì3717. They are equivalent only in the case where all perturbers and resonances are far from the precessing body. Definition The axis of this Laplace plane is coplanar with, and between, (a) the polar axis of the parent planet's spin, and (b) the orbital axis of the parent planet's orbit around the Sun. The Laplace plane arises because the equatorial oblateness of the parent planet tends to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet's equatorial plane, while the solar perturbations tend to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet's orbital plane around the Sun. The two effects acting together result in an intermediate position for the reference axis for the satellite orbit's precession. Explanation In effect, this is the plane normal to the orbital precession pole of the satellite. It is a kind of \\"average orbital plane\\" of the satellite, around which the instantaneous orbital plane of the satellite precesses, and to which it has a constant additional inclination.See P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.) (1992), Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, University Science Books, Sausalito (Ca), pages 327-9. In most cases, the Laplace plane is very close to the equatorial plane of its primary planet (if the satellite is very close to its planet) or to the plane of the primary planet's orbit around the Sun (if the satellite is far away from its planet). This is because the strength of the planet's perturbation on the satellite's orbit is much stronger for orbits close to the planet, but drops below the strength of the Sun's perturbation for orbits farther away. Examples of satellites whose Laplace plane is close to their planet's equatorial plane include the satellites of Mars and the inner satellites of the giant planets. Examples of satellites whose Laplace plane is close to their planet's orbital plane include Earth's Moon and the outer satellites of the giant planets. Some satellites, such as Saturn's Iapetus, are situated in the transitional zone and have Laplace planes that are midway between their planet's equatorial plane and the plane of its solar orbit. So the varying positions of the Laplace plane at varying distances from the primary planet can be pictured as putting together a warped or non-planar surface, which may be pictured as a series of concentric rings whose orientation in space is variable: the innermost rings are near the equatorial plane of rotation and oblateness of the planet, and the outermost rings near its solar orbital plane. Also, in some cases, larger satellites of a planet (such as Neptune's Triton) can affect the Laplace planes of smaller satellites orbiting the same planet. The work of Laplace The Laplace or Laplacean plane, as discussed here, relates to the orbit of a planetary satellite. It is to be distinguished from another and quite different plane, also discovered by Laplace, and which is also sometimes called the \\"Laplacian\\" or \\"Laplace plane\\", but more often the invariable plane (or the \\"invariable plane of Laplace\\"). The invariable plane is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta, and is \\"invariable\\" over the entire system, while the Laplace plane may be different for different orbiting objects within a system. Confusingly, a satellite's Laplace plane (as defined here) is also sometimes called its \\"invariable plane\\". The Laplace plane is a result of perturbational effects, which were discovered by Laplace while he was investigating the orbits of Jupiter‚Äôs principal moons (the Galilean satellites of Jupiter). Laplace found that the effects of the solar perturbing force, and of the planet‚Äôs oblateness (its equatorial bulge), together gave rise to an \\"inclinaison propre\\", an \\"own inclination\\", in the plane of the satellite orbits, relative to the plane of Jupiter‚Äôs equator.Pierre-Simon Laplace (1805), M√©canique c√©leste, Volume 4, Book 8, Courcier, Paris, 1805.

Canton was a significant place in McKinley's life; he lived there, practiced as an attorney, and conducted his political campaigns from the town. Memorial Association, contributions Photo showing \\"The Long Water\\" which was removed in 1951 Following the funeral, several of the President's closest advisors, including George B. Cortelyou, William R. Day of Canton and Ohio Senator Mark Hanna, met to discuss the location of a proper memorial to serve as a final resting place for the former president. It was from this meeting that the McKinley National Memorial Association was formed and Theodore Roosevelt chose the first Board of Trustees, with recommendations from the President's widow, Ida Saxton McKinley. The Association chose a site often visited by President McKinley. In fact, McKinley once suggested that a monument be erected on that very site to honor soldiers and sailors from Stark County killed in American wars. By October 10, 1901, the Association issued a public appeal for $600,000 in contributions for the construction project. Ohio Governor George Nash supported the effort by proclaiming McKinley's birthday in 1902 as a special day of observance by the state's schools. On that day school children contributed to the memorial fund in large numbers by bringing in their pennies. In June 1903 contributions reached $500,000, and the Association invited people to submit design ideas for the proposed memorial. Contributions arrived from foreign nations, notably Great Britain. Designs, construction Over sixty designs were submitted, and Harold Van Buren Magonigle of New York City was selected as the winner of the competition. Magonigle envisioned a cross-hilted sword with a mausoleum located at the junction of the blade, guard, and hilt. The Long Water (a five-tiered reflecting pool which was 575 feet long) and main steps would form the blade of the sword. This design combined the cross of a martyr with the sword of a President who had acted as commander-in-chief during wartime. Construction of the memorial began on June 6, 1905, when Mr. Magonigle removed the first shovel of soil from the site. By November 16 the cornerstone was laid in an official ceremony attended by the former First Lady, Ida Saxton McKinley, and other family members. More than 35,000 cubic yards (27,000 m¬≥) of soil were added to create four terraces coinciding in height and pitch with the four runs of steps in the main staircase. The steps are wide and arranged in four flights of 24. Another 12 steps take visitors into the monument. In total, there are 108 steps from ground level to the top of the monument. The interior walls consist of Tennessee marble.Christopher Kenney, The McKinley Monument (The History Press, 2006), p. 54. The 9-1/2 foot tall bronze statue depicting President McKinley delivering his final public address at Buffalo, New York, on September 5, 1901 was created by sculptor Charles Henry Niehaus. It is based on a photograph of the President taken by White House photographer Frances B. Johnston at the Pan-American Exposition the day before his assassination. Ceremony The McKinley National Memorial dedication on September 30, 1907 was one of the most memorable events in Canton's history. President Theodore Roosevelt joined other dignitaries to observe a grand parade from the review stand at Public Square in downtown Canton. In the dedication ceremony, Supreme Court Justice William R. Day, President of the McKinley National Memorial Association and a former member of McKinley's cabinet, delivered a narrative of events leading to the dedication. United States Poet Laureate James Whitcomb Riley read a memorial poem he wrote in honor of the fallen president. Finally, President Roosevelt, the principal speaker of the day, addressed the crowd, highlighting McKinley's career. Mayor of Canton at the time, Arthur Richard Turnbull also attended along with Ohio Governor Harris. The coffins of the President and First Lady are entombed above ground in double sarcophagi of elegant green granite. The McKinley National Memorial in January 2007 William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum Maintenance, rededication After the dedication the McKinley National Memorial Association continued to exercise administrative control of the monument, but it eventually became difficult for the Association to maintain the structure and the grounds. On October 20, 1943 the property was transferred to the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society, which is now the Ohio History Connection. In 1951 the State of Ohio completed a major rehabilitation to the site, including filling in the Long Water. The work was completed in time for a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of President McKinley's death. A re-dedication of the Memorial was held on September 16, 1951. The McKinley National Memorial returned to local control in 1973 when the property was transferred to the Stark County Historical Society. After five years of restoration work and enhancement of the grounds the McKinley National Memorial was rededicated on September 29, 1992. The William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, also operated by the Stark County Historical Society, is located adjacent to the memorial.

He is Australia's most awarded oarsman, having made appearances at six Olympic games (for three gold and one bronze medal); eleven World Championships (for seven world titles including one in each of the five sweep oar events); four Rowing World Cups (for two titles) and eighteen state representative King's Cup appearances - the Australian blue riband men's VIII event, (for fifteen victories, ten as stroke). Tomkins is one of only five Australian athletes and four rowers worldwide to compete at six Olympics. From 1990 to 1998 he was the stroke of Australia's prominent world class crew - the coxless four known as the Oarsome Foursome. Club and state rowing Tomkins took up rowing at Carey Baptist Grammar School. He stroked the Carey first VIII in both of his senior years, 1982 and 1983. His long senior club career was with the Mercantile Rowing Club in Melbourne. Tomkins was selected in Victorian state representative King's Cup crews contesting the men's Interstate Eight-Oared Championship at the Australian Rowing Championships on eighteen occasions from 1985 to 2004. Tomkins was in winning Victorian King's Cup crews on fifteen occasions, for ten of which he was in stroke seat. Tomkins competed in Mercantile colours in the National Regatta at the Australian Rowing Championships in coxless pairs and in coxed and coxless fours from 1985. He won Australian national titles at those Australian Rowing Championships in 1985, 1987 & 1988 in a 2-; in 1986 & 1987 in a 4+; and in 1988 & 1990 in a 4- with other members of the Oarsome Foursome.1988 Austn C'ships at Guerin Foster International representative rowing In 1985, Tomkins first made the Australian national team as stroke of the senior men's eight for the 1985 World Rowing Championships in Hazewinkel Belgium. The Australian VIII finished in ninth place. In 1986, the Australian eight stroked by Steve Evans won a gold medal at the 1986 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, England with Tomkins rowing in the six seat. That same crew rowed to victory at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, and Tomkins won a Commonwealth Games gold medal. Tomkins also stroked a coxed four to a bronze medal at those same games. At the World Championships in Copenhagen 1987 Tomkins was in the six seat when the men's VIII finished in fourth place and at the 1988 Summer Olympics, the Australian eight finished fourth with Tomkins again rowing at six.1988 Olympics In 1990 with his Mercantile clubmates Samuel Patten & Mike McKay and Nick Green from the Melbourne University Boat Club, Tomkins began racing an Australian representative coxless four. Their success was immediate. They won the 1990 and 1991 World Championships.Tomkins at World Rowing After Andrew Cooper replaced Samuel Patten, they followed up with a gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The crew's success gained them the nickname Oarsome Foursome and lifted the profile of rowing in Australia. The crew repeated its gold medal performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics, this time with Drew Ginn replacing Andrew Cooper. At the 1998 World Championships, the Oarsome Foursome raced and won the men's coxed four world title with Brett Hayman in the stern. Tomkins, Green and Hayman also took the world title at that same regatta as a coxed pair. In 1999, the boat would go on to try out, but lose the 1999 Australian selection trials in a coxless four. Tomkins and Drew Ginn decided to switch to a coxless pair and won the 1999 World Championship. This win established Tomkins as the first man to win a gold medal at World Championships in each of the five sweep rowing events. Tomkins and Ginn had planned to row the pair at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but while in Europe preparing for the games, a severe back injury requiring surgery sidelined Ginn. On short notice, Tomkins teamed with team alternate Matthew Long, (who had to switch from stroke side to bow side) and they raced a surprising third at the Lucerne World Cup race. Tomkins and Long were selected to represent Australia, and at the Olympics, they finished third behind France and the United States, just 1.3 seconds out of first place. Australian M4-. Returning to a coxless pair in 2002, Ginn and Tomkins beat the heavily favoured British crew of Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell in a world cup race before finishing a close fourth at the 2002 World Championships. In 2003, Ginn and Tomkins reversed the prior years result winning the 2003 World Championship, with Pinsent and Cracknell placing fourth. In 2004, Pinsent and Cracknell moved to the coxless four to better their chances for a medal. Ginn and Tomkins would go on to win the coxless pair at the 2004 Summer Olympics, leading at every mark, beating Croatia by 2 seconds, with South Africa claiming the bronze. Tomkins was selected in the men's eight for the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich, placing a disappointing 4th. He competed in his sixth Olympic Games at Beijing following the disqualification of the Russian Federation boat as a result of a doping scandal. Tomkins was the Australian flag bearer at the Opening Ceremony. Tomkins and his crew finished last in the final of the men's eight and 6th overall at the Beijing Games. He is one of four athletes to compete in rowing at six Olympics, along with Romanian Elisabeta Oleniuc LipƒÉ in 2004, Canadian cox Lesley Thompson, and Estonian J√ºri Jaanson. Accolades James Tomkins was announced as the 2008 Victorian Father of the Year by the Father's Day Council of Victoria Inc. In 2010 he was inducted as a member of the Rowing Victoria Hall of Fame and that same year the International Rowing Federation awarded Tomkins the Thomas Keller Medal for his outstanding international rowing career. It is the sport's highest honor and is awarded within five years of the athlete's retirement, acknowledging an exceptional career and exemplary sportsmanship. In 2012 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame Hall of Fame and was elected to the IOC Athletes' Commission. He will serve as an IOC member for eight years.Results of the IOC Athletes' Commission Election Tomkins also helped to build the Carey/Yarra Yarra Boat Sheds on the Yarra River in Melbourne. There is an eight named after him in Carey boatshed.

Overview Year-to-date is used in many contexts, mainly for recording results of an activity in the time between a date (exclusive, since this day may not yet be \\"complete\\") and the beginning of the year. In the context of finance, YTD is often provided in financial statements detailing the performance of a business entity. Providing current YTD results, as well as YTD results for one or more past years as of the same date, allows owners, managers, investors, and other stakeholders to compare the company's current performance to that of past periods. Employees' income tax may be based on total earnings in the tax year to date. YTD describes the return so far this year. For example: the year to date (ytd) return for the stock is 8%. This means from January 1 of the current year to date, stock has appreciated by 8%. Another example: the year to date (ytd) rental income of a property (whose Fiscal Year End is March 31, 2009) is $1000 as of June 30, 2008. This means that the property brought in $1000 of rental income during the period April 1 through June 30, 2008 (= the ytd period for the property). Comparing YTD measures can be misleading if not much of the year has occurred, or the date is not clear. YTD measures are more sensitive to early changes than late changes. Contrast YTD with the concept of 12-months-ending (or Year-ending), which are more resistant to seasonal influences. Example: to calculate year- to-date Invoicing for a company, invoice totals for each previous month of the current year are added to total invoices for the current month to date. Example Example: YTD Invoicing report for May 3 January Invoices-----$ 35,000 February Invoices---- 40,000 March Invoices------- 25,000 April Invoices------- 45,000 May Invoices--------- 5,000 _______ YTD Invoices 150,000 Alternate method: 1st quarter Invoices-----$ 100,000 April Invoices----------- 45,000 May Invoices------------- 5,000 _______ YTD Invoices 150,000 Tax due as of the end of week 33 of the tax year is calculated on total pay from the beginning of week 1 until the end of week 33; tax payable for that week will be this total tax minus tax already paid.

At the 2016 Census Windsor had a population of 7,281. Windsor is bounded by Dandenong Road, St Kilda Road, Williams Road and High Street. History Known at first as Prahran South, the suburb's name was changed to Windsor in 1891, after Windsor, Berkshire. It is often incorrectly referred to as Prahran, Windsor's northern neighbour. In the past, Windsor was within the City of Prahran's boundaries and many institutions still refer to this. A Windsor Post Office opened in 1856, but was renamed St Kilda in 1858. The Windsor Post Office in the area opened in 1886. Today Although Stonnington's smallest suburb, Windsor has its own bank, supermarket and historic pubs, along with a growing number of independent clothing stores, restaurants, bars, lounges and caf√©s. Windsor contains a diverse mix of housing, including medium density apartments, Victorian terrace housing and a high-rise public housing tower. The Prahran campus of Swinburne University used to be located just south of High Street in Windsor, but this is now Melbourne Polytechnic ‚Äì Prahran Campus, although it is actually in Windsor. The National Institute of Circus Arts is in Green Street, Windsor. The painkiller Aspro was invented by the chemist George Nicholas in Windsor.Slough Museum: Aspro History Nuttelex margarine was also manufactured in Windsor for many years but production shifted in the last few years to Knoxfield. Melbourne's famous Chapel Street shopping strip bisects Windsor, and the Windsor end is seen as being the more bohemian, less expensive end of the street, although as development continues, the Windsor end of Chapel Street is becoming highly sought-after real estate, with many of the smaller retro-type clothing and vintage stores making way for new venues and some chain restaurants. Landmarks The suburb has many landmarks, including the historic Presentation Convent (now a secondary school), the Windsor Primary School, old post office, Telstra exchange tower and a campus of Swinburne University. In recent times, the large Empire Cinemas, converted into a nightclub, was gutted by fire before eventually being demolished and replaced by high-rise apartments, also named the Empire. The remains of one side of Punt Road at the Windsor end contains one of Windsor's lesser shopping strips, called Little Windsor on Punt. The suburb also features new design, including the award-winning Windsor Fire station, by architects Edmund and Corrigan. In Raleigh Street are the K2 apartments, a Sustainable architecture built in 2006, to the design of Hansen Yuncken and features passive solar design, recycled and sustainable materials, photovoltaic cells, wastewater treatment, rainwater collection and solar hot water. There are many remaining hotels in the suburb, including the popular Windsor Castle and Pint on Punt. The new Prahran High School has been built on part of the grounds of what is now Melbourne Polytechnic. The new High School is a vertical school consisting of 4 levels with a gymnasium on the top floor. The school will open its doors in 2019 and receive its first intake of grade 7 students. Transport Windsor is serviced by a number of trams along Dandenong Road, High Street and Chapel Street (routes 5,6,64 and 78) with Metro Trains Melbourne's Sandringham railway line takes commuters from Windsor Station to the CBD in 10 minutes. The 216 and 219 buses operate along Williams Road. Punt Road is one of the main bus thoroughfares in Melbourne with its route 246 passing through the western side of the suburb.

Litter can also be used as a verb; to litter means to drop and leave objects, often man- made, such as aluminum cans, paper cups, fast food wrappers, cardboard boxes or plastic bottles on the ground, and leave them there indefinitely or for other people to dispose of as opposed to disposing of them correctly. Large and hazardous items of rubbish such as tires, electrical appliances, electronics, batteries and large industrial containers are sometimes dumped in isolated locations, such as national forests and other public lands. It is a human impact on the environment and remains a serious environmental problem in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before decomposition and be transported over large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect the quality of life. Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded each year.Novotny, T.E. & Zhao, F. (1999). Consumption and production waste: another externality of tobacco use. Tobacco Control, 8, 75-80. Estimates on the required time for cigarette butts to break down vary, ranging from five years to 400 years for complete degradation. Causes Strathfield station in Sydney, Australia. Rubbish accumulated over months, perhaps years due to unsustained periods of frequent cleaning A small river's valley in India shows extensive littering of plastic and paper. Human waste, illustrated by the urinating man, increase fecal coliform and other bacteria levels in the water. Littering in nature In addition to intentional littering, almost half of litter on U.S. roadways is now accidental or unintentional litter, usually debris that falls off improperly secured trash, recycling collection vehicles and pickup trucks. Population levels, traffic density and proximity to waste disposal sites are factors known to correlate with higher litter rates. Illegally dumped hazardous waste may be a result of the costs of dropping materials at designated sites: some of these charge a fee for depositing hazardous material. Lack of access to nearby facilities that accept hazardous waste may deter use. Additionally, ignorance of the laws that regulate the proper disposal of hazardous waste may cause improper disposal. According to a study by the Dutch organization VROM, 80% of people claim that \\"everybody leaves a piece of paper, tin or something, on the street behind\\". Young people from 12 to 24 years cause more litter than the average (Dutch or Belgian) person; only 18% of people who regularly cause litter were 50 years of age or older. However, a 2010 survey of littering in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States, placed litterers aged 55 and over at less than 5%. The same observational study estimated that 78% of litterers are male. In 1999, research by Keep America Beautiful found that 75% of Americans admitted to littering the last five years, yet 99% of the same individuals admitted that they enjoyed a clean environment. Negligent or lenient law enforcement contributes to littering behavior. Other causes are inconvenience, entitlement and economic conditions. A survey of dumping in Pennsylvania found that the largest number of illegal dumps were in townships without municipal trash hauling. The same report also cites unavailability of curbside trash and recycling service, shortage of enforcement, and habit as possible causes. The presence of litter invites more littering. =Two-stage process model= The two-stage process model of littering behavior describes the different ways in which people litter. The model was proposed by Chris Sibley and James Liu and differentiates between two types of littering: active and passive.Sibley, C.G., & Liu, J.H. (2003). Differentiating active and passive littering: A two- stage process model of littering behavior in public spaces. Environment and Behavior, 35, 415‚Äì433. The theory has implications for understanding the different types of litter reduction interventions that will most effectively reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all things being equal, passive littering will be more resistant to change because of two psychological processes: 1. diffusion of responsibility that increases as the latency between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.  Life cycle  Litter can remain visible for extended periods of time before it eventually biodegrades, with some items made of condensed glass, styrofoam or plastic possibly remaining in the environment for over a million years. About 18 percent of litter, usually traveling through stormwater systems, ends up in local streams, rivers, and waterways. Uncollected litter can accrete and flow into streams, local bays and estuaries. Litter in the ocean either washes up on beaches or collects in Ocean gyres such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. About 80 percent of marine debris comes from land-based sources.Faris, J. and Hart, K., Seas of Debris: A Summary of the Third International Conference on Marine Debris, N.C. Sea Grant College Program and NOAA, 1994, title page. Some litter that is collected can be recycled, however degraded litter cannot be recycled and eventually degrades to sludge, often toxic. The majority of litter that is collected goes to landfills. Effects Litter can have a detrimental impact on humans and the environment in different ways. =Effects on humans= These car tires were discarded on the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor in this photo from 1973. Tire dumping is still a concern today and could benefit from tire recycling. Hazardous materials encapsulated within tires and other items of illegally dumped rubbish can leach into water sources, contaminate the soil and pollute the air. Tires are the most often dumped hazardous waste. In 2007 the United States generated 262 million scrap tires. Thirty-eight states have laws that ban whole tires being deposited in landfills. Many of these discarded tires end up illegally dumped on public lands. Tires can become a breeding ground for insect vectors which can transmit disease to humans. Mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water, can transmit West Nile virus and malaria. Rodents nest in accumulated tires and can transmit diseases such as Hantavirus. When tires are burned, they can smolder for long periods of time, emitting hundreds of chemical compounds that pollute the air causing respiratory illnesses. Additionally the residue left behind can harm the soil and leach into groundwater. bolus from a Hawaiian albatross (either a black-footed albatross or a Laysan albatross) has several ingested flotsam items, including monofilament from fishing nets and a discarded toothbrush. Ingestion of plastic flotsam can be an increasing health risk to albatrosses, Tern Island, French Frigate Shoals. Visual pollution is a major effect of litter. Open containers such as paper cups, cardboard food packets, plastic drink bottles and aluminum drinks cans get filled up with rainwater, providing breeding locations for mosquitoes. In addition, a spark or a lightning flash can start a fire if it strikes litter such as a paper bag or cardboard box. Litter can be hazardous to health. Debris falling from vehicles is an increasing cause of automobile accidents. Discarded dangerous goods, chemicals, tires, sharps waste and pathogens resulting from litter can cause accidental harm to humans. Litter also carries substantial cost to the economy. Cleaning up litter in the US costs hundreds of dollars per ton, about ten times more than the cost of trash disposal, with a cost totaling about $11 billion per year.Newsobserver.com =Effects on wildlife= Animals may get trapped or poisoned with litter in their habitats. Cigarette butts and filters are a threat to wildlife and have been found in the stomachs of fish, birds and whales, who have mistaken them for food. Also animals can get trapped in the rubbish and be in serious discomfort. For example, the plastic used to hold beverage cans together can get wrapped around animals' necks and cause them to suffocate as they grow. Other instances where animals could be harmed by litter include broken glass lacerating the paws of dogs, cats, and other small mammals. Most litter in Victoria, Australia ends up in or near oceans, beaches or rivers. =Other effects= Organic litter in large amounts can cause water pollution and lead to algal blooms.Litter management - Townsville City Council Cigarettes could also start fires if they are not put out and then discarded in the environment. Extent Litter is an environmental concern in many countries around the world. While countries in the developing world lack the resources to deal with the issue, consumer based economies in the western world are capable of generating larger quantities of litter per capita due to a higher consumption of disposable products. =Branded litter= A number of credible studies have shown that fast food packaging is one of the most common forms of litter while McDonald's is the most common brand of litter, despite having messages to dispose of properly, such as the Ronald McDonald \\"tidy man\\" marking. According to Keep Britain Tidy in 2013, Cadbury chocolate wrappers, Walkers crisp packets and Coca-Cola cans were the three top brands that were the most common pieces of rubbish found in UK streets. Solutions \\"No littering\\" sign as used in the USA Holder for waste bags at a playground in central Ystad 2020, an initiative of the municipality to stop littering in public places. =Litter bins= Recycling and rubbish bin at a German railway station. Public waste containers or street bins are provided by local authorities to be used as a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils collect the waste and take it for reuse or recycling. However, there are some problems with this approach; if the bins are not emptied regularly, then the bins will overflow and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may often be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage dumpster diving. =Cleanup= Naval Weapons Station Charleston, South Carolina. Volunteers at completed cleanup on hiking trail Volunteers, sometimes alone or coordinated through organizations, pick up litter and dispose of it. Clean up events may be organized in which participants will sometimes comb an area in a line to ensure that no litter is missed. Organizations may promote litter cleanup events and may also have separate media campaigns to prevent littering. In North America, Adopt a Highway programs are popular, in which companies and organizations commit to cleaning stretches of road. Keep America Beautiful has held litter cleanups called the Great America Cleanup since 1998 in over 20,000 communities nationwide. Earth Day cleanups have been held globally since 1970. In 2019, Earth Day Network partnered with Keep America Beautiful and National Cleanup Day for the inaugural nationwide Earth Day CleanUp. Cleanups were held in all 50 States, 5 US Territories, 5,300 sites and had more than 500,000 volunteers.Earth Day 2019 CleanUp Earth Day Network Launches Great Global Clean Up Commercial properties such as retail, office and industrial have litter picking maintenance programs. This service may be provided by property owners or contracted to various service providers by property management companies acting on owner's behalf. Litter picking is performed on foot using simple hand tools. A worker will walk the sidewalks, parking lot and landscape and sweep up litter material into a litter collection tool. Contents are emptied into a waste bin on job site. In Kiwayu, a Kenyan island, some of the collected litter (flip-flops) is used to make art, which is then sold. =Litter traps= A Parks Victoria litter trap on the river to catch floating rubbish on the Yarra River at Birrarung Marr in Melbourne, Australia. Litter traps can be used to capture litter as it exits stormwater drains into waterways. However, litter traps are only effective for large or floating items of litter and must be maintained. A recent watershed litter survey showed a difference in the composition of street litter and stormwater litter. =Monitoring dumping sites= Increasingly, there have been efforts to use technology to monitor areas prone to dumping. In Japan, a study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map areas of dumping based on site characteristics. Another study used satellite images to detect possible illegal dumping sites. =Container deposit legislation= Container deposit legislation can be aimed at both reducing littering and also encouraging picking up through local recycling programs that offer incentives, particularly for aluminium cans, glass bottles and plastic bottles. In New York, an expanded bottle bill that included plastic water bottles increased recycling rates and generated 120 million dollars in revenue to the state General Fund from unclaimed deposits in 2010. In some countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, container deposit legislation has been introduced on cans and plastic bottles. Parts of Belgium are also considering adopting such legislation. People can thus collect refund value money from this type of waste. The result of this is that in Germany, hardly any cans or plastic bottles can still be found along the road. In the Netherlands, the amount of litter has dropped considerably since the new law was implemented, and 95% of the plastic bottles are now recycled. According to Chris Snick, the revenue that can be obtained from waste picking can be financially profitable in countries where container deposit legislation has been introduced: in 1 hour he managed to pick up 108 cans and 31 plastic bottles, earning him 13.90 euro (‚Ç¨0.10 per can/plastic bottle).Het Nieuwsblad, 23 august 2014; \\"13.90 euro voor wat gedeulte blikjes, geen slecht uurloon\\" By comparison, in countries where only the value of the aluminum for example would be refunded, 139 cans would yield only 1.72 euro (0.0124 euro per can; assuming there is 15 grams of aluminum in a can, and with scrap aluminum valued at 0.8267 euro/kg). =Fines= No littering sign at a highway in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Some countries and local authorities have introduced legislation to address the problem. Actions resulting in fines can include on-the-spot fines for individuals administered by authorised officers in public or on public transport or littering from a vehicle, in which the vehicle owner is fined - reported by either responsible officer or third party, sometimes online. Specific legislation exists in the following countries: * United States - punishable with a more than $500 fine, community service, or both, as set out by state statutes and city ordinances. All 50 states have anti-litter laws, with various fines, community service, and/or imprisonment as possible punishment. * United Kingdom - Leaving litter is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This was extended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 under section 18. It carries a maximum penalty of ¬£2500 upon conviction. However, many local authorities issue fixed penalty notices under section 88 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Often incorrectly known as \\"on the spot fines\\", they do not have to be issued on the spot. Nor are they a fine. If an alleged offender does not want to pay a fixed penalty notice, he can have the case heard in the Magistrates Court. * Australia - no national legislation, although state based environmental protection authorities have laws and fines to discourage littering. * The Netherlands - Dutch police and local supervisors (known as buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar, or BOA) fine citizens for throwing away cans, bottles or wrappers on the street. Anti-litter campaigns The International Tidy Man Many groups exist with the aim of raising awareness and run campaigns including clean up events. World Cleanup Day is a worldwide campaign. TrashTag and Plogging are examples of individual scale litter movements. In the United States there are a number of organizations running anti-litter campaigns. Keep America Beautiful was founded in 1953, and promulgated the word litterbug, coined by its partner the Ad Council in 1947. At least 38 states have high profile, government-recognized slogan campaigns, including Don't Mess with Texas; Let's Pick It Up New York; Don't Trash California; Take Pride in Florida; Keep Iowa Beautiful. National CleanUp Day is held annually on the Third Saturday in September. In Australia, Clean Up Australia Day is supported by many major Australian companies, firms and volunteers alike. Anti-litter organizations include \\"Keep Australia Beautiful\\", founded in 1963. It created the popular \\"Do the Right Thing\\" campaign and its Tidy Towns competition became well known being a very competitive expression of civic pride. Keep Britain Tidy is a British campaign run by the Keep Britain Tidy environmental charity, which is part funded by the UK government. History Throughout human history, people have disposed of unwanted materials onto streets, roadsides, in small local dumps or often in remote locations. Prior to reforms within cities in the mid-to-late 19th century, sanitation was not a government priority. The growing piles of waste led to the spread of disease. Anti- littering legislation seems to have existed in ancient Greece, as is evidenced by a road marker discovered on the island of Paros, bearing the inscription \\"whoever drops their litter on the street owes 51 drachmae to whoever wishes to claim them\\". To address the growing amount of waste generated in the United States, the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 was enacted. In 1976 the Federal government amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act, creating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which requires a \\"cradle to grave\\" approach to the proper handling of potentially hazardous materials. RCRA gives authority to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and enforce proper hazardous waste disposal. Many countries now have laws that require that household hazardous waste be deposited in a special location rather than sent to landfills with regular refuse. Household hazardous waste includes paints and solvents, chemicals, light bulbs, fluorescent lights, spray cans, and yard products such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and insecticides. Additionally, medical waste generated at home is considered a hazardous waste and must be disposed of properly.

It is bounded by Prospect Park on the east and northeast, Park Slope at 8th Avenue on the northwest, Green-Wood Cemetery on the southwest, and Kensington at Caton Avenue on the south. As of the 2010 United States Census, Windsor Terrace had 20,988 people living within its area. Windsor Terrace is part of Brooklyn Community District 7, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11215 and 11218. It is patrolled by the 72nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Fire services are provided by Engine Company 240/Battalion 48 of the New York City Fire Department. Politically, Windsor Terrace is represented by the New York City Council's 38th and 39th Districts. History Before the coming of Europeans to the New World, the area which is now Windsor Terrace was inhabited by the Canarsee Indians.See:  Specifically, the Gowanus and Werpos tribes inhabited the surrounding area. The land, which was then in the far northwestern corner of the Town of Flatbush, was purchased as a farm by John Vanderbilt. Some parts of the land were also maintained by the Martense family, who owned land in the area through 1895. This area was desirable due to its proximity to downtown Brooklyn, as well as the recent construction of the Coney Island Plank Road through the area and of the serene Green-Wood Cemetery to the southwest. Following Vanderbilt's death, his land was divided in two. Vanderbilt's land were sold to William Bell, a real estate developer, in 1849. Bell subdivided the land into 47 building lots, and, unlike some other developers in the general area, was able to sell them rather quickly., p.933 Bell then renamed the area after one of the multiple places named Windsor in England. Bell sold part of the land to Edward Belknap in 1851, and Belknap subsequently built four streets on which he marked 49 lots for future \\"Pleasant Cottages.\\" The development was incorporated as the Village of Windsor Terrace, which was bounded by Church Avenue on the south, McDonald Avenue on the west, the Brooklyn‚ÄìFlatbush town line on the north, and Prospect Park Southwest and Coney Island Avenue on the east. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle first referred to the area as \\"Windsor Terrace\\" in March 1854. By 1856, Belknap had lost his land due to foreclosure. The area was generally desirable due to its prime location in the far northwest of the Town of Flatbush; close to the City of Brooklyn, yet located far enough outside it that residents of Windsor Terrace were willing to move there for its suburban ambience; and within walking distance of Brooklyn Rapid Transit's streetcar lines. Additional blocks were developed in 1862, when the village had 30 inhabitants living in twelve houses. The village kept growing through the 1870s, boasting a Protestant chapel by 1874, a public school by 1876, and its own volunteer fire department by 1888. The village remained rural in feel until around 1900, when row houses began to be built throughout the area, at first along Prospect Park SW. Development began to pick up pace during the 1920s as rumors circulated that the neighborhood would soon be served by the New York City Subway. There were a lot of single-family and two-family houses being built, as well as stores being opened on 11th Avenue and two apartment buildings being erected on Prospect Avenue. Many of the new occupants of Windsor Terrace were Irish- Americans, many of whose families remain there to this day. The 1933 arrival of the Independent Subway System (IND) ushered in an era of apartment-building construction. Even into the 1960s, Windsor Terrace was an isolated neighborhood with a quiet small-town feel to it, although the construction of the Prospect Expressway brought more through-traffic past the area. Gentrification of the neighborhood began in the 1980s, with families who could not afford the prices in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope coming to Windsor Terrace instead, looking for more affordable real estate. During this time, the old square block-sized Pilgrim Laundry, site of an ancient Victorian-era brick edifice at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Terrace Place, was razed and replaced with 17 two-family houses constructed in 1983. The houses were funded with the cooperation of a public-private partnership and sold through lottery to locals. This brought attention to the need for affordable housing in Brooklyn, and in the late 1980s, the neighborhood was rezoned to prevent the construction of high-rise buildings in order to retain the small-town fabric of the existing neighborhood. However, by then, gentrification of the neighborhood had started, and would continue through the 2000s. Residents protested after Key Food, the only major supermarket in the neighborhood, closed down in 2015. A new, smaller Key Food-owned store called Windsor Farms Market was opened and is currently operating in a portion of the old location. A food co-op called \\"Windsor Terrace Food Coop\\", using the model of the Park Slope Food Coop, was also organized at the same time. The co-op serves both as a supplier of food and a community focal point. Although residents must pay a one-time fee and commit to a work requirement to be able to shop at the co-op, the food is generally cheaper than at local supermarkets. Location and street grid =Boundaries= Typical residential street in Windsor Terrace Windsor Terrace, which is part of Community Board 7, consists of a narrow, nine-block-wide area. Located in central Brooklyn, the neighborhood has a \\"curved, somewhat comma-like shape\\". The neighborhood lies between Green-Wood Cemetery to the southwest and Prospect Park to the northeast, split down the middle by the Prospect Expressway. Adjacent neighborhoods include Park Slope to the northeast and Kensington to the south. According to The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn, Windsor Terrace is bounded by Prospect Park West on the north, Prospect Park SW and Coney Island Avenue on the east, Caton Avenue on the south and McDonald Avenue on the west.\\"Windsor Terrace\\" in , pp.212-214 However, the Encyclopedia of New York City gives the boundaries as Seventh Avenue and Prospect Park W on the north, Prospect Park SW to the east, and Green-Wood Cemetery to the south and west.Gallagher, John J. \\"Windsor Terrace\\" in , p.1405 Other sources extend the northwest corner to Eighth Avenue along 15th Street and 20th Street.\\"Windsor Terrace\\" Google Maps Accessed:February 26, 2015 Windsor Terrace straddles the line between the original Dutch Colonial Brooklyn towns of Brooklyn and Flatbush, as can be seen from its street grid that is bent approximately northeast-southwest along present-day Terrace Place. Old South Brooklyn (which now finds itself more westerly in disposition within the expanded boundaries of modern, consolidated Brooklyn) is located to the north of Terrace Place in the direction of 11th Avenue, and the Town of Flatbush lay to the south, located in the direction of Seeley Street. The grid of old Brooklyn, which is tilted at an angle, is adjacent to the Flatbush grid, which is roughly aligned with the cardinal directions, at this juncture. The only other still-extant nuance of this ancient Dutch boundary is the legacy of original Catholic Parish boundaries, which are between Holy Name of Jesus to the north and Immaculate Heart of Mary to the south, and ZIP Codes applied much later (11215 to the north and 11218 to the south). In this area, Vanderbilt Street, named after John Vanderbilt, splits western Brooklyn's general street grid (comprising numbered avenues from 1st‚Äì101st Streets) and southeastern Brooklyn's general street grid (comprising lettered avenues from East 1st to East 108th Streets). =Streets= There are three streets between 16th and 17th Streets in the Windsor Terrace street grid, since the streets diverge from each other from Park Slope eastward. The northernmost of the streets is Windsor Place, which runs between 7th Avenue and Prospect Park Southwest. The southernmost of the streets is Prospect Avenue, which continues southward to Ocean Parkway (near the Fort Hamilton Parkway overpass across the Prospect Expressway) and northward to Third Avenue. Running between these two streets from 10th Avenue to Terrace Place, Sherman Street is named after Roger Sherman, a signatory of the Declaration of Colonial Rights, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. The street name \\"Windsor Place\\" has been applied to two different streets throughout the neighborhood's history. The current Windsor Place was formerly Braxton Street before the 1900s, while 16th Street between Prospect Park W and Prospect Park SW was known as \\"Windsor Place\\" before then. Prospect Park West takes the place of 9th Avenue in the Windsor Terrace grid, and continues with the \\"Prospect Park West\\" name south of Prospect Park's borders, continuing southeastward to Green-Wood Cemetery, where it ends in a cul-de-sac. The stretch of Prospect Park West between 16th Street and Green-Wood Cemetery has always been called the same name as the stretch adjoining Prospect Park; the entire street was formerly and officially named 9th Avenue. Southeast of Prospect Park West, past Bartel-Pritchard Square, 15th Street becomes Prospect Park Southwest. The road bends noticeably between 11th Avenue and 16th Street; Prospect Park Southwest was previously known as Coney Island Avenue and originally known as the \\"Coney Island Plank Road\\" in the days of unpaved roads, when logs or \\"planks\\" were laid for stability and to keep the mud down. The southernmost stretch of Prospect Park Southwest, south of the bend at the termination of 16th Street, still retains Coney Island Avenue's street numbering system. Prospect Avenue extends from Hamilton Avenue to Ocean Parkway and is crossed by a bridge at Seely Street. The northern part was originally known as Middle Street and had its southernmost limit at what is now Terrace Place. An attempt was made in 1865 to change the name of Middle Street to Sterling Street, possibly for Lord Stirling, but was vetoed by Mayor Alfred M. Wood. Prospect Park's establishment required additional access, and in 1868 the New York Legislature passed an act that provided for Middle Street's renaming to Prospect Avenue and its widening from . Maps made in 1874 for the Kings County Town Survey Commission provided for a extension of Prospect Avenue into the Town of Flatbush; however, this was stymied by a steep, boulder-strewn terminal moraine, and the fact that the city of Brooklyn's and town of Flatbush's sections of the road were misaligned. In 1903, plans were approved to correct the misalignment; Prospect Avenue was extended through the cut, and Seely Street was placed over Prospect Avenue on a concrete-and-steel arch bridge. Co-named streets 16th Street is co-named \\"Captain Vincent E. Brunton Way\\" after a New York City Fire Department captain who died in the September 11 attacks. 10th Avenue is also co-named \\"John P. Devaney Boulevard\\" in this area after a firefighter who died while trying to rescue residents of a burning Red Hook building in 1989. Traffic circles Traffic circles are relatively rare in New York City, but Windsor Terrace has three of them, all framing Prospect Park entrances along the park's border. The northernmost, a medium-sized traffic circle named Bartel-Pritchard Square, is at the intersection of Prospect Park W, Prospect Park SW, and 15th Street, and contains an ornate entrance framed with two columns. Another traffic circle is at Prospect Park Southwest and 16th Street. The southernmost, a large traffic circle named Park Circle, is at the convergence of Prospect Park Southwest, Coney Island Avenue, Parkside Avenue, Ocean Parkway, and Fort Hamilton Parkway, and was reconstructed in 2010. Park Circle's entrance to Prospect Park is designed in a style similar to the Bartel-Pritchard Square entrance. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Windsor Terrace was 20,988, an increase of 209 (1.0%) from the 20,779 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

Accessed June 14, 2016. Culture The Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles on Greenwood AvenueImmaculate Heart of Mary Church Windsor Terrace is home to mainly Irish-, German-, Polish-, and Italian-American families, many having settled in its brick row and wood-frame houses when the neighborhood was first developed. The overwhelming majority of residents ‚Äì many of whom can trace their family histories in Windsor Terrace back multiple generations ‚Äì are Irish-American. They are traditionally affiliated with either Holy Name Church and School (the church having been built in 1874 and the school having been built in 1923, both located on present-day Prospect Park W), or Immaculate Heart of Mary (located on Fort Hamilton Parkway in Windsor Terrace's southeastern extremity). Other smaller Protestant denominations exist nearby, such as the Memorial Baptist Church at 16th Street and 8th Avenue, and Holy Apostles Episcopal on Greenwood Avenue. Over time, Windsor Terrace has become increasingly diverse, as Greek and Hispanic residents have moved in. There is also a small minority of Syrians, Maronite Lebanese, and Jewish-Americans. The local synagogue is the Chabad Jewish Center. There is also a newer place of worship, the Calvary Cathedral of Praise at Caton Place and East Eighth Street. By the 2000s and 2010s, an influx of residents seeking affordable family housing had pushed property prices up. In 2015, houses in various parts of Windsor Terrace sold for about $1.2 million to $2 million in 2015, and apartments cost from $400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to more than $1 million for a three-bedroom apartment. Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and not as many families with young children. The increased presence of many families with young kids has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood. However, despite the increased population, the area still maintains a bit of small-town atmosphere, with relatively low house turnover. A real estate broker who grew up in the area said that in Windsor Terrace, \\"everybody says hello\\" to each other, and a real-estate feature in The New York Times stated that \\"residents look out for one another at all hours of the day.\\" There is more on-street vehicle parking in Windsor Terrace than in nearby, more populous neighborhoods. The area's lack of traffic lights, due to low traffic volumes, make Windsor Terrace feel like a small town, as do well- maintained one-family houses, some with covered balconies and stained glass windows; other houses with \\"bay windows, both rounded and faceted\\"; and yet other \\"clapboard Italianate\\" houses with multicolored cornices. There are a few apartment buildings, including Windsor Tower, a 10-story building that was downgraded from 22 stories after community objections; a 73-unit, seven-floor rental building that opened in 2015; and a condominium tower at 279 Prospect Park W, a former paint factory storage building that posed as a bank in the 1975 movie Dog Day Afternoon. The houses are of varying types, including some small one-story clapboard houses that have attics and date to the neighborhood's development; larger two-story houses with basements and some wood framing on the exterior; and attached brick townhouses with either flat facades with normal-sized windows or curved facades with bay windows, both with two floors and a basement. The neighborhood is mostly residential, with some commerce along Prospect Park W, Prospect Avenue, and Fort Hamilton Parkway. The latter two corridors have seen an increased commercial presence since the 2000s, but these new stores are mostly family-owned businesses, with the exception of a Walgreens and a grocery store in the area. There are at least four bars (The renown Farrell's Bar & Grill, the Double Windsor, Rhythm and Booze and the Adirondack) as well as a combination cafe and food store called The Tuscan Gun; a combination pub and restaurant called Hamilton's; a French restaurant called Le Paddock; and a Middle Eastern restaurant called Batata. The commercial streets are also lined with new \\"coffee shops, yoga studios and vegetarian restaurants\\" that have popped up since the area's gentrification. Police and crime Windsor Terrace is patrolled by the 72nd Precinct of the NYPD, located at 830 4th Avenue. The 72nd Precinct ranked 16th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. Total crime has decreased since the 1990s, and the 72nd Precinct is one of the safest precincts in Brooklyn . The 72nd Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 79.1% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 2 murders, 32 rapes, 185 robberies, 209 felony assaults, 153 burglaries, 468 grand larcenies, and 77 grand larcenies auto in 2018. Fire safety The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) operates the Engine Company 240/Battalion 48 fire station at 1307 Prospect Avenue. The company supersedes a volunteer fire department created in 1888. Brooklyn Fire Department Engine 40 was created with that number on January 20, 1896, moving into a firehouse at 1307-1309 Prospect Avenue (which is now a city landmark). The company was incorporated into the FDNY as Engine Company 240 on January 1, 1913. The firehouse was built in 1896 in the Romanesque Revival style. It is constructed of brick, limestone, and slate. It was named a New York City designated landmark in February 2013. Its lookout tower hails from a time where fire alarm systems were nonexistent.  Post office and ZIP Codes  Windsor Terrace is covered by ZIP Codes 11215 and 11218, which respectively cover the northern and southern parts of the neighborhood. The United States Post Office operates the Prospect Park West Station post office at 225 Prospect Park West.

Windsor Terrace was once part of New York's 11th congressional district, but following redistricting in 2012, the neighborhood became part of the 9th congressional district.New York Redistricting, New York Times (March 20, 2012). Windsor Terrace is a heavily Democratic area; in the 2016 Presidential election, 84% of the 9th Congressional district (where Windsor Terrace has been located since redistricting in 2013) voted for Hillary Clinton, compared to 15% for rival Donald Trump. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Clinton narrowly won the primary in Windsor Terrace, receiving 2,756 votes () to Bernie Sanders's 2,568 votes () with a total of 5,324 Democrats voting.Matthew Bloch & Wilson Andrews, How Every New York City Neighborhood Voted in the Democratic Primary, New York Times (April 20, 2016). Windsor Terrace had relatively few Republican primary voters. Just 371 voters cast ballots in the 2016 Republican primary, with 197 people ( of the Republican electorate in the neighborhood) voting for Donald Trump, 120 for John Kasich ( of the Republican electorate), and 54 for Ted Cruz ( of the Republican electorate).Matthew Bloch & Wilson Andrews, How Every New York City Neighborhood Voted in the Republican Primary, New York Times (April 20, 2016). Education The Windsor Terrace branch of the Brooklyn Public Library =Schools= The neighborhood public schools, PS 130 Parkside School on Ocean Avenue and PS 154 Windsor Terrace School on 11th Avenue, are well regarded. Each school features a number of special enrichment programs for students, such as chess and journalism.Hemphill, Clara New York City‚Äôs Best Public Elementary Schools: A Parent‚Äôs Guide, Third Edition, Teacher‚Äôs College Press, 2005, Although PS 154 initially received a \\"D\\" grade under New York City's school grading system introduced in 2007, both public schools received \\"A\\" grades in the 2010‚Äì11 New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) Progress Reports. However, while PS 130's rating remained an \\"A\\" through the next year, PS 154's rating went down to a \\"C\\" in 2012, due to its \\"D\\" grade in the \\"Student progress\\" section, which comprises 60% of the annual progress grade at each school. In 2013‚Äì2014, 64% of PS 154 students met or exceeded Common Core standards in the English Language Arts (ELA) exams and 65% met or exceeded the standards on the math exams. However, at PS 130, just 32% of ELA test-takers met or exceeded standards, and only 41% did so on the math test. The NYCDOE district in which the schools are operated, District 15, was rezoned in 2014 due to an increased enrollment in the two schools; some students formerly zoned to PS 154 are now zoned to PS 130. This rezoning proved contentious, with some rezoned students' parents saying that the rezoning requires some students to travel over across \\"two highways\\" to get to school. In addition, since the rezoning, PS 154 has seen an increase in enrollment despite its decreased student catchment area; in 2016‚Äì2017, the school had its first-ever student waiting list, amid cuts to the school's pre- kindergarten program. There is also another public school nearby, PS 295 on 18th Street in Park Slope, to accommodate extra students from Windsor Terrace. In the 2012‚Äì2013 NYCDOE Progress Report, this school also received an \\"A\\", garnering a quality score of 60.2 out of 100. MS 839, serving grades 6-8, is located at 713 Caton Avenue. Brooklyn College Academy operates an annex site for freshmen and sophomore high school students at 350 Coney Island Avenue, with the juniors' and seniors' building at Brooklyn College. The St Joseph the Worker Catholic Academy opened in 2012. This Catholic school is a consolidation of Holy Name of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary's elementary schools into Holy Name's existing infrastructure on 9th Avenue, offering Pre-K(3) to 8th Grade, including Honors Classes and after school programs. Another Catholic school, Bishop Ford High School, formerly operated at 500 19th Street in Windsor Terrace from 1952 to 2014. It closed in June 2014 due to lowered revenues from declining enrollment, with only 25% of its 2006 enrollment. The former school site is now the location of K280, a pre- kindergarten school. =Library= The Brooklyn Public Library's Windsor Terrace branch is located at East 5th Street at Fort Hamilton Parkway. It began as a \\"deposit station\\" with a small collection in 1922, but after 1940, service was intermittent after the library moved to a makeshift structure created out of two old streetcars. In 1969, it moved again into the current library building, which had been completed that year.\\"Windsor Terrace Library\\" on the Brooklyn Public Library website The library was renovated in 1994, and again in 2011. In 2016, a campaign was started in which people were to \\"like\\" the library's Facebook page so that the library could get a garden; this was part of an initiative in which Facebook users from Brooklyn can vote on which Brooklyn Public Library branches could get $5,000 of extra funding for various programs. The library closed for a one-and-a-half-year renovation in February 2019. Transportation 15th Street‚ÄìProspect Park station Windsor Terrace is served by the New York City Subway's 15th Street‚ÄìProspect Park and Fort Hamilton Parkway stations on the IND Culver Line (now carrying the ). The section of the line containing these two stations opened on October 7, 1933, as part of a \\"temporary\\" extension to Church Avenue in Kensington,New York Times, City Subway Extended, October 7, 1933, page 16 where it was to have connected with Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) subway services via a ramp to Ditmas Avenue. The former station, 15th Street, has stone entrances set into the park walls. The latter station, Fort Hamilton Parkway, has a long passageway due to its unusual location under the Prospect Expressway; its three entrances (one on Fort Hamilton Parkway itself, and two on Prospect Avenue) straddle the expressway, which splits the neighborhood in two. MTA Regional Bus Operations operates bus routes in the area. , there are four local bus routes: the B61, B67, B68, and B69. Several express buses and the B103 Limited bus pass through Windsor Terrace without stopping. As elsewhere in Brooklyn, trolley service, operated by the BMT's rapid transit arm, ran in the neighborhood well into the 1950s and early '60s. The Seventh Avenue Line (now the B67 bus route) was converted from trolley to bus operations in 1951, and a year later, the Vanderbilt Avenue Line (now the B69) was similarly converted. A trolley barn, located between Green-Wood Cemetery and the Prospect Expressway, formerly served the Culver and Crosstown trolley lines on a site where a former federal prison was located during the American Civil War. It was replaced in 1962 by the Bishop Ford High School. The Prospect Expressway, built between 1953 and 1960, runs through the middle of the neighborhood, with the majority of the neighborhood northeast of the expressway, and a small part of the neighborhood in the southwest connected by various bridges to the northeast section. Some neighborhood streets, such as Greenwood Avenue and Vanderbilt Place, were bisected by the expressway and remain so, while others, such as Seeley Street, 11th Avenue/Terrace Place, and Prospect Park W, are bridged over the highway. A plan to extend the highway along Ocean Parkway was never realized, though Ocean Parkway serves as a service road for the expressway for a short distance in southern Windsor Terrace. In the late 1950s, the Holy Name of Jesus Church led a failed effort to try to reroute the Prospect Expressway elsewhere or cancel the expressway altogether. Notable locations Kensington Stables Kensington Stables is the only remaining stable near Prospect Park. In the days where horse stables saw a lot of business, there were many dozens of stables in the area. The barn was built in 1930 as the last extension of the riding academy at 11 Ocean Parkway, 57 Caton Place (built in 1917).\\"Horseback Riding\\" on the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation website The original riding academy closed in 1937 and is now a warehouse. By around the 1940s, the stables started to disappear, with some being converted into bowling alleys or roller skating rinks, and others just disappearing. Today, Kensington Stables gives lessons in The Shoe in Prospect Park. Kensington Stables now exists on the Windsor Terrace side of the border between Kensington and Windsor Terrace.\\"Kensington Real Estate\\" on NYC.gov Bartel-Pritchard Square, in Windsor Terrace's northern extremity, is a traffic circle at the intersection of Prospect Park West, 15th Street, and Prospect Park Southwest. Its name commemorates local residents, Emil Bartel and William Pritchard, who died during World War I while in combat. The circle, which was dedicated under its current name in 1922, originally had a flower garden in its center. A black granite monument in the center of the circle‚Äîinstalled in 1965 as a result of a donation by the Patrick J. Devaney Post #964, VFW of the U.S.‚Äîmemorializes all of the locals who have died in war. One side has the inscription \\"In memory of the men / of this community who / have given their lives / In wartime service/ to their country / Erected by / Patrick J. Devaney Post #964 / V.F.W. of U.S. / 1965\\" while the other side has the inscription \\"For Valor / and / Sacrifice / 1965\\". Like similar structures such as Times Square and Herald Square, the Bartel- Pritchard Square is geometrically not a square, despite its name. The park entrance adjoining Bartel‚ÄìPritchard Square is shaped as a gateway between two Stanford White-designed granite pillars with \\"what appears to be huge bronze lanterns\\" adorning the pillars' apexes. The pillars, which are based on an acanthus column in Delphi with sculptures on top, were unveiled in 1906, shortly after White had died. The columns at the park entrance outside Bartel- Pritchard Square Since at least 1908, Windsor Terrace has had its own movie theater since the Marathon Theatre opened at present-day 188 Prospect Park W in 1908. The 500-seat Marathon Theatre had a Wurlitzer organ installed in 1927, shortly before its 1928 demolition. In August of that year, the 1,516-seat, Art Deco Sanders Theatre was opened on the site of the former Marathon Theatre, where it operated for half a century before its closure in 1976. The building stood vacant for twenty years after that, and investors bought the building in 1993 in hopes of reopening the theatre. The Pavilion Theatre, a 3-screen movie theater within the defunct Sanders Theatre building, opened in 1996 to positive reception from the surrounding communities, which had experienced a cultural decline in prior years. The theater, which expanded to 9 screens in October 2004, suffered from complaints about broken toilets, poorly maintained seats, and sticky floors, as well as a rumor of bedbug- infested upholstery and malfunctions in the theater's heating system. In October 2016, the building was closed in preparation for conversion to a 7-screen, 650-seat theatre. Operated by Nitehawk Cinema, the refurbished Pavilion Theatre, where patrons would be able to dine and watch movies simultaneously, was Nitehawk's second movie theater within Brooklyn. The renovated theater ultimately reopened on December 19, 2018. Farrell's Bar & Grill, at 16th Street and Prospect Park W, is a noted community institution that has been continuously run by three owners since 1933. Famous among the fire and police officers who live in the community, it is said to be one of the first bars in New York City to get its liquor license at the end of Prohibition. It has been used as a standard bar backdrop in many film sequences. The neighborhood legend persists that until 1971, when Shirley MacLaine and Pete Hamill went into the bar during the filming of Desperate Characters and successfully demanded that MacLaine be served from the bar; until that time, Farrell's only served men at the bar and women at the rear of the establishment. Farrell's, which known for being open every day from 10 a.m. to 3 a.m., was closed for a nine-day renovation in 2006, marking the bar's longest duration of closure since Prohibition ended. Its iconic styrofoam cups filled with beer, a tradition since its cardboard \\"containers\\" were replaced by Styrofoam \\"containers\\" in 1985, were discontinued in 2015 following a citywide ban on Styrofoam food implements. Due to Windsor Terrace's topography, there is a terminal moraine that ends in Windsor Terrace, creating a steep slope. As a result, at the location where the intersection of Seeley Street and Prospect Avenue would have been; Seeley Street uses a concrete arch bridge that spans above Prospect Avenue. The bridge was built by 1903 at a cost of $22,000, and is supported by underpinning since the IND subway runs under Prospect Avenue at this point. While street bridges that span other streets are more common in the hilly Bronx, they are rare in Brooklyn. This particular bridge does not appear on contemporary maps. The bridge has a stairway on its side that connects the two streets.
