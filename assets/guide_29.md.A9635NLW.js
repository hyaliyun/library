He was deported with the Kassite noblemen in chains to Susa accompanied by the booty pillaged from the various Babylonian temples, whose most notable example was the cult statue of Marduk, an act so sacrilegious to the Babylonians that it would forever cast Kutir-Nahhunte in infamy.

Paris, 10 June 1911, d. Paris, 19 January 1977), was a French sculptor. Gilioli was one of the representatives of abstract French sculpture in the 1950s.  Biography  √âmile Gilioli was born to a family of Italian shoemakers who had settled beside the Canal Saint-Martin. After the First World War, the family moved back towards Italy, settling in Nice. In 1932, Gilioli took courses at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs de Nice, notably with the future artist Marie Raymond. During the Second World War, Gilioli was mobilized in Grenoble where he passed the remainder of the conflict. He made the acquaintance of Andry-Fracy, conservationist at the Grenoble Mus√©e des beaux-arts, and led him to discover cubism. After the war, Gilioli settled in Saint-Martin-de-la-Cluze near Grenoble, where he sculpted in his workshop. His art was associated in a certain way with the deeds of the French Resistance. He became friendly with Thomas Gleb. He advised his friend Georges Ladrey, who wished to leave the Alpes pour Paris with the intention of perfecting his skills in an art school, to develop his personal artistic vision, judging that his technique was sufficiently refined. In 1947, Gilioli exhibited in the salon des r√©alit√©s nouvelles in Paris. In 1949, Gilioli took part in the first Salon de la jeune sculpture in the garden and chapel of the Mus√©e Rodin in Paris. The first salon was attended by 63 sculptors including Gilioli, Emmanuel Auricoste, √âtienne Hajdu, Baltasar Lobo and Berto Lardera. From 1954 onwards, Gilioli took part in collective exhibitions with other artists such as √âtienne Martin, Alicia Penalba, Fran√ßois Stahly and Simone Boisecq. In 1997 to mark the 20th anniversary of Gilioli's death, the municipalit√© of Saint- Martin-de-la-Cluze decided to acquire Gilioli's house and workshop, respecting the expressed wish of his wife Babet to create a space dedicated to the artist's memory. In 2004, the workshop/house was turned into a museum/library which hosts a permanent exhibition presenting Gilioli's work.

Conventional airplanes accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process to land. Some airplanes can take off at low speed, this being a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier Jump Jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off vertically, but some designs can land horizontally. Horizontal takeoff and landing =Aircraft= Conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) =Takeoff= Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aircraft goes through a transition from moving along the ground (taxiing) to flying in the air, usually starting on a runway. For balloons, helicopters and some specialized fixed-wing aircraft (VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier), no runway is needed. Takeoff is the opposite of landing.

Note the ruffled feathers on top of the wings indicate that the swan is flying at the stalling speed. The extended and splayed feathers act as lift augmenters in the same way as an aircraft's slats and flaps. Piper J3C-65 Cub lands on a trailer as part of an airshow. F-18 landing on an aircraft carrier Landing is the last part of a flight, where a flying aircraft or spacecraft (or animals) returns to the ground. When the flying object returns to water, the process is called alighting, although it is commonly called \\"landing\\" and \\"touchdown\\" as well. A normal aircraft flight would include several parts of flight including taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent and landing. Short takeoff and landing (STOL) STOL is an acronym for short take-off and landing, aircraft with very short runway requirements. Catapult launch and arrested recovery (CATOBAR) Catapult launches aboard USS Ronald Reagan CATOBAR (catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery) is a system used for the launch and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier. Under this technique, aircraft are launched using a catapult and land on the ship (the recovery phase) using arrestor wires. Although this system is more costly than alternative methods, it provides greater flexibility in carrier operations, since it allows the vessel to support conventional aircraft. Alternate methods of launch and recovery can only use aircraft with STOVL or STOBAR capability. Short Take Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) STOBAR (Short Take Off But Arrested Recovery) is a system used for the launch and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier, combining elements of both STOVL (Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing) and CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery). =Spacecraft (HTHL)= Horizontal takeoff, horizontal landing (HTHL) ‚Äî is the mode of operation for the first private commercial spaceplane, the two-stage-to-space Scaled Composites Tier One from the Ansari X-Prize SpaceShipOne/WhiteKnightOne combination. It is also used for the upcoming Tier 1b SpaceShipTwo/WhiteKnightTwo combination. A prominent example of its use was the North American X-15 program. In these examples the space craft are carried to altitude on a \\"mother ship\\" before launch. The failed proposals for NASA Space Shuttle replacements, Rockwell X-30 NASP used this mode of operation but were conceived as single stage to orbit. The Lynx rocketplane was a suborbital HTHL spaceplane developed by XCOR Aerospace that was slated to begin atmospheric flight testing in late 2011. However, after numerous delays, XCOR Aerospace went bankrupt in 2017 without finishing a prototype. Reaction Engines Skylon, a design descendant of the 1980s British HOTOL (\\"Horizontal Take-Off and Landing\\") design project, is an HTHL spaceplane currently in the early stages of development in the United Kingdom. Both the Lynx rocketplane and SpaceShipTwo have been proffered to NASA to carry suborbital research payloads in response to NASA's suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) solicitation under the NASA Flight Operations Program. An early example was the 1960s Northrop HL-10 atmospheric test aircraft where the HL stands for \\"Horizontal Lander\\".HL-10 Lifting Body Fact Sheet, NASA, 2009-12-03, accessed 2011-02-16. Vertical takeoff and landing Different terms are used for takeoff and landing depending on the source of thrust used. VTVL uses rockets, whereas VTOL uses air, propelled via some kind of rotor system. =Aircraft (VTOL)= Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft includes fixed-wing aircraft that can hover, take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as tiltrotors.\\"Vertical Takeoff & Landing Aircraft,\\" John P. Campbell, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1962.Rogers 1989.Laskowitz, I.B. \\"Vertical Take- Off and Landing (VTOL) Aircraft.\\" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Vol. 107, Art.1, 25 March 1963.\\"Straight Up - A History of Vertical Flight,\\" Steve Markman and Bill Holder, Schiffer Publishing, 2000. The terminology for spacecraft and rockets is VTVL (vertical takeoff with vertical landing).\\"Masten Space Systems Achieves First-Ever VTVL Midair Engine Relight Milestone on Path to Space.\\" SpaceRef.com, 29 May 2010. Retrieved: 10 July 2011. Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing). Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing). Besides the ubiquitous helicopter, there are currently two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: craft using a tiltrotor, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, and aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the Harrier family. In the civilian sector currently only helicopters are in general use (some other types of commercial VTOL aircraft have been proposed and are under development as of 2017). =Rocket (VTVL)= Vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) is a form of takeoff and landing for rockets. Multiple VTVL craft have flown. The most widely known and commercially successful VTVL rocket is SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage. VTVL technologies were developed substantially with small rockets after 2000, in part due to incentive prize competitions like the Lunar Lander Challenge. Successful small VTVL rockets were developed by Masten Space Systems, Armadillo Aerospace, and others. Vertical takeoff and horizontal landing =Aircraft (VTOHL)= In aviation the term VTOHL (\\"Vertical Take-Off and Horizontal Landing\\") as well as several VTOHL aviation-specific subtypes: VTOCL, VTOSL, VTOBAR exist. Zero length launch system The zero length launch system or zero length take-off system (ZLL, ZLTO, ZEL, ZELL) was a system whereby jet fighters and attack aircraft were intended to be placed upon rockets attached to mobile launch platforms. Most zero length launch experiments took place in the 1950s, during the Cold War. =Spacecraft (VTHL)= Vertical takeoff, horizontal landing (VTHL) is the mode of operation for all current and formerly operational orbital spaceplanes, such as the Boeing X-37, the NASA Space Shuttle, the 1988 Soviet Buran space shuttle, as well as the circa-1960 USAF Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar project. For launch vehicles an advantage of VTHL over HTHL is that the wing can be smaller, since it only has to carry the landing weight of the vehicle, rather than the takeoff weight.AIAA 2003-09-09 Flight mechanics of manned Sub- Orbital Reusable Launch Vehicles with Recommendations for Launch and Recovery-M Sarigul-Klijn & N Sarigul-Klijn There have been several other VTHL proposals that never flew including NASA Space Shuttle proposed replacements Lockheed Martin X-33 and VentureStar. The 1990s NASA concept spaceplane, the HL-20 Personnel Launch System (HL stands for \\"Horizontal Lander\\"), was VTHL, as was a circa-2003 derivative of the HL-20, the Orbital Space Plane concept. , two VTHL commercial spaceplanes were in various stages of proposal/development, both successors to the HL-20 design. The Sierra Nevada Corporation Dream Chaser follows the outer mold line of the earlier HL-20. The circa-2011 proposed Orbital Sciences Corporation Prometheus was a blended lifting body spaceplane that followed the outer mold line of the circa-2003 Orbital Space Plane, itself a derivative of the HL-20; however, Prometheus did not receive any NASA contracts and Orbital has announced they will not pursue further development. German Aerospace Center studied reusable VTHL Liquid Fly- back Boosters from 1999. Design was intended to replace Ariane 5 solid rocket boosters. The U.S. government-funded, , Reusable Booster System program, initiated by the USAF in 2010, had specified a high-level requirement that the design be VTHL, but the funding was discontinued after 2012. In 2017 DARPA selected a VTHL design for XS-1. HTVL Horizontal takeoff, vertical landing (HTVL) is the spaceflight equivalent of aviation HTOVL (and its subtypes CTOVL, STOVL, CATOVL). This mode of operation has not been used, but has been proposed for some systems that use a two-stage to orbit launch system with a plane based first stage, and a capsule return vehicle. One of the few HTVL concept vehicles is the 1960s concept spacecraft Hyperion SSTO, designed by Philip Bono. Multi-mode configurations Vehicles use more than one mode also exist. =Vertical/Short takeoff landing (V/STOL)= Vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft that are able to take off or land vertically or on short runways. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) includes craft that do not require runways at all. Generally, a V/STOL aircraft needs to be able to hover; helicopters are not typically considered under the V/STOL classification. A rolling takeoff, sometimes with a ramp (ski-jump), reduces the amount of thrust required to lift an aircraft from the ground (compared with vertical takeoff), and hence increases the payload and range that can be achieved for a given thrust. For instance, the Harrier is incapable of taking off vertically with a full weapons and fuel load. Hence V/STOL aircraft generally use a runway if it is available. I.e. Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) or Conventional Take-off and Landing (CTOL) operation is preferred to VTOL operation. V/STOL was developed to allow fast jets to be operated from clearings in forests, from very short runways, and from small aircraft carriers that would previously only have been able to carry helicopters. The main advantage of V/STOL aircraft is closer basing to the enemy, which reduces response time and tanker support requirements. In the case of the Falklands War, it also permitted high performance fighter air cover and ground attack without a large aircraft carrier equipped with a catapult. The latest V/STOL aircraft is the F-35B, which entered service in 2015.

It is now in the National Gallery, London, United Kingdom. History The work was commissioned on 3 January 1526 in Rome, by Maria Bufalini, wife of Antonio Caccialupi, to decorate the family chapel in the church of San Salvatore in Lauro. The contract mentioned \\"Francesco Mazola de Parma\\" and one \\"Pietro\\" with the same name, perhaps Parmigianino's uncle Piero Ilario Mazzola. The elongated shape derives from its original destination as part of a triptych, whose sides (never painted) should represent the Immaculate Conception (to which the chapel was dedicated) and the saints Joachim and Anna. According to late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari, Parmigianino was working to this painting during the Sack of Rome, and he had to stop when the city was ravaged by the imperial troops. He was able to escape paying a ransom, while his uncle remained in Rome, being able to hide the painting in the refectory of Santa Maria della Pace. Detail of St. Jerome sleeping. In 1558 the Bufalini family decided to move it in their chapel in Sant'Agostino at Citt√† di Castello, from where it was acquired in 1790 by the English painter James Durno. In England, it was sold to the Marquess of Albercon for 1,500 guineas, then, after a series of changes of hand, to the National Gallery, in 1826. There are preparatory drawings in the Mus√©e Cond√©, the British Museum and other museums, for a total of some twenty. A drawing in the Galleria nazionale di Parma is the one which is more similar to the final version, although showing a horizontal composition. Description The painting is divided into two narrative sectors: a lower one, with Saint Jerome is sleeping near the crucifix (with his traditional symbol, the cardinal hat visible near a skull) and receives the vision of St. John the Baptist, identified by the long cross and the baptismal washbasin which is tied at his belt; St. John indicates the Child, represented in the upper sector between the legs of the Madonna, with a shining background behind them. Parmigianino's attention to detail is shown by the Baptist's reed cross, the speckled skin which covers him, the undergrowth near the sleeping Jerome, the sheen on Mary's dress, the last perhaps inspired by classical sculptures seen by Parmigianino during his trips. St. John's raised right arm and upwards-pointing finger are reminiscent of Leonardo's painting St. John the Baptist.

A hot water storage tank where one of the heat sources is solar heating A, that is sent into the hot water storage tank via a smaller pump B (circle with triangle) and the heat exchanger spiral in the hot water storage tank. The other spiral C can be used for a e.g. oil-fired boiler or a wood burner. At D the hot water gets out and domestic cold water is sent back at the bottom at E. A hot water storage tank where one of the heat sources is solar heating. Almost the same example as above, but in a domestic habitat. A hot water storage tank (also called a hot water tank, thermal storage tank, hot water thermal storage unit, heat storage tank and hot water cylinder) is a water tank used for storing hot water for space heating or domestic use. Water is a convenient heat storage medium because it has a high specific heat capacity. This means, compared to other substances, it can store more heat per unit of weight. Water is non-toxic and low cost. An efficiently insulated tank can retain stored heat for days, reducing fuel costs. Hot water tanks may have a built-in gas or oil burner system, electric immersion heaters. Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a central heating system, or heated water from another energy source. The most typical, in the domestic context, is a fossil-fuel burner, electric immersion elements, or a district heating scheme. Water heaters for washing, bathing, or laundry have thermostat controls to regulate the temperature, in the range of , and are connected to the domestic cold water supply. Where the local water supply has a high content of dissolved minerals such as limestone, heating the water causes the minerals to precipitate in the tank (scaling). A tank may develop leaks due to corrosion after only a few years, a problem exacerbated by dissolved oxygen in the water which accelerates corrosion of both tank and fittings.  Insulation  Typically hot water storage tanks are wrapped in heat insulation to reduce energy consumption, speed up the heating process, and maintain the desired operating temperature. Thicker thermal insulation reduces standby heat loss. Water heaters are available with various insulation ratings but it is possible to add layers of extra insulation on the outside of a water heater to reduce heat loss. In extreme conditions, the heater itself might be wholly enclosed in a specially constructed insulated space. The most commonly available type of water heater insulation is fiberglass, fixed in place with tape or straps or the outer jacket of the water heater. Insulation must not block air flow or combustion gas outflow, where a burner is used. In extremely humid locations, adding insulation to an already well-insulated tank may cause condensation leading to rust, mold, or other operational problems so some air flow must be maintained, usually by convection caused by waste heat, but in particularly humid conditions such ventilation may be fan-assisted. Most modern water heaters have applied polyurethane foam (PUF) insulation. Where access to the inner tank is a priority (in cases of particularly aggressive minerals or oxygen levels in the local water supply) the PUF can be applied in encapsulated form, allowing the removal of insulation layer for regular integrity checks and if required, repairs to the water tank.  Solar hot water storage tank  In a solar water heating system, a solar hot water storage tank stores heat from solar thermal collectors..Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189‚Äì207, ISSN (Online) 1869-8778 The tank has a built-in heat- exchanger to heat domestic cold water. In relatively mild climates, such as the Mediterranean, the (heavily insulated but metal-wrapped) storage tanks are often roof-mounted. All such tanks share the same problems as artificially- heated tanks including limestone deposit and corrosion, and suffer similar reductions in overall efficiency unless scrupulously maintained.  Water tank leakage  Water heater tanks may be made of vitreous enamel-lined carbon steel, stainless steel, or copper. While copper and stainless steel domestic hot water tanks are more commonplace in Europe, carbon steel tanks are more common in the United States, where typically the periodic check is neglected, the tank develops a leak whereupon the entire appliance is replaced. Even when neglected, carbon steel tanks tend to last for a few years more than their manufacturer's warranty, which is typically 3 to 12 years in the US. Vitreous- lined tanks are much lower in initial cost, and often include one or more sacrificial anode rods designed to protect the tank from perforation caused by corrosion made necessary since chlorinated water is very corrosive to carbon steel. As it is very nearly impossible to apply any protective coating perfectly (without microscopic cracks or pinhole defects in the protective layer) manufacturers may recommend a periodic check of any sacrificial anode, replacing it when necessary. Some manufacturers offer an extended warranty kit that includes a replacement anode rod. Because conventional hot water storage tanks can be expected to leak every 5 to 15 years, high-quality installations will include, and most US building/plumbing codes now require, a shallow metal or plastic pan to collect the seepage when it occurs.  Hot water storage tank with closed water circuit  This method stores heat in a tank by using external heat-exchangers (coils) that can be directly tapped or used to power other (external) heat-exchangers. The chief benefit is that by avoiding drawing-off domestic hot water directly, the tank is not continually fed with cold water, which in 'hard' water areas reduces the deposit of limescale to whatever is dissolved in the original charge of water plus relatively trivial amounts added to replace losses due to seepage. An added benefit is reduced oxygen levels in such a closed system, which allows for some relaxation in the requirements for materials used in the hot water storage tank and the closed water circuits, external heat exchangers, and associated pipework. While an external heat exchanger system used for domestic hot water will have mineral deposits, descaling agents extend the life of such a system.  Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit  :For an illustration - see reference Another method to store heat in a hot water storage tank has many names: Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit, stratified thermal storage, thermocline tank and water stratified tank storage but in all cases the significant difference is that pains are taken to maintain the vertical stratification of the water column, in other words to keep the hot water at the top of the tank while the water at the bottom is at a distinctly lower temperature. This is desirable in places with a wide climatic range where summer cooling is as important as heating in winter, and entails one or more of the following measures: * Different heating and cooling loops must send the heated or cooled water in with as low a velocity as possible. (This necessarily entails heating and cooling loops having velocity controlled pumps and tube ports with the maximum feasible diameter.) * For cooling applications, cool water is sent out from the bottom and warm (return) water is fed in at the top. * Heating applications get hot water out at the top and return cool water to the bottom. * \\"Stratification-enhancing\\" devices within the hot water storage tank (but if the water inlet velocity is as low as possible this might not be needed). * A more advanced heat control systemTechnische Alternative: Freely programmable universal controller UVR1611 , Manuals and firmware in English and German: downloads, Programing examples: UVR-Beispielsammlung, Practical examples on solar heating systems with hot water storage tanks with current measuring date: Livedaten is required. When a stratified hot water storage tank has closed water circuits, the water temperatures can be up to 90 to 95 ¬∞C at the top and 20 to 40 ¬∞C at the bottom. Calm, undisturbed water is a relatively poor heat conductor when compared to glass, bricks and soil. (Illustrated by a still lake, where the surface water can be comfortably warm for swimming but deeper layers be so cold as to represent a danger to swimmers, the same effect as gives rise to notices in London's city docks warning 'Danger Cold Deep Water). Accordingly, an arbitrary volume of hot water can be stored, as long as the stratification is kept intact. In this case there must not be vertical metal plates or tubes as they would conduct heat through the water layers, defeating the purpose of stratification. When effectively employed this technique can maintain water as high as 95 ¬∞C (i.e. just below boiling) yielding a higher energy density, and this energy can be stored a long time provided the hot water remains undiluted. Depending on the purpose of the installations, water exchanges tapping different levels allow water temperatures appropriate to the required use to be selected.Solar heating system with stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit and the possibility of reading many current parameters: solar.webseiten.cc: Live-Daten Holzhausen In many solar heating systems the energy parameters can be read as a function of time, from the 'dwell' time necessary to transform daylight into heat, at its peak the maximum hot water temperature near the top of the tank.invest-tools.com: Graphs, Main page and description: Overview of the DHW system, The water tank (heat reservoir) Quote: \\"...With the tank there came a 10 cm \\"soft foam\\" isolation that fulfills the minimum insulation requirements...So after several months, I added another round of 16 cm aluminum coated glass wool, and now the tank stores enough heat for about 7 or 8 days when it is full loaded (temperature range is 95¬∞C down to 40¬∞C)...\\"  Dual element electric  When flow starts from the uppermost outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom. This drop in temperature causes the thermostat to switch on the electric heating element at the bottom of the tank. When the water at the top of the tank is drawn off the hot water at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on. When the flow stops, the elements stay on until their settings are met. While it is common to have the top and bottom thermostats set differently in order to save energy, the fact that hot water rises means the thermostat controlling the upper element should feed the hottest supply, while the lower element the warmest. If the thermostats in such a system are reversed - warm feed from the top, hot from the center - it may not only affect the energy efficiency of the system, feeding scalding water to a domestic hot water outlet may be dangerous, or if directed to warm-feed washers damage them beyond repair. Safety issues Hot water can cause painful, dangerous scalding injuries, especially in children and the elderly. Water at the outlet should not exceed 49 degrees Celsius. Some jurisdictions set a limit of 49 degrees on tank setpoint temperature. On the other hand, water stored below 60 degrees Celsius can permit the growth of bacteria, such as those that cause Legionnaire's disease, which is a particular danger to those with compromised immune systems. One technical solution would be use of mixing valves at outlets used for sinks, baths or showers, that would automatically mix cold water to maintain a maximum below 49 C. A proposal to add this to the building code of Canada was unsuccessful. https://canadasafetycouncil.org/home-safety/heated- debate-about-hot-water See also * Uniform Mechanical Code * Uniform Plumbing Code * Uniform Solar Energy and Hydronics Code References Category:Energy storage Category:Residential heating appliances Category:Heating ","title":"Hot water storage tank"},{"id":"33129495","text":"Lunpo Gangri, also known as Loinbo Kangri, is a Himalayan mountain in Tibet Autonomous Region, China.

Brown was active in Yosemite Valley from the 1920s to the 1950s. Background Brown was born in Yosemite Valley in 1896, and in his youth, his family lived near El Portal. His mother was Lena Brown, usually called a Southern Miwok, who married John Brown in 1900. He probably had some Paiute ancestry, through a band called the Kucadikadi living near Mono Lake, and may also have had Chukchansi Yokut ancestry as well. Brown was named after Norwegian-born artist and basket collector Christian August Jorgensen (1860-1935), who lived in Yosemite Valley for many years. Brown was \\"well-acquainted with Miwok ritual and religion\\". Brown was known as \\"one of the most popular personalities in Yosemite\\", famous for performing \\"dances of his own invention, wearing elaborate beadwork and featherwork of his own design\\". Costumes He incorporated a Sioux vest and moccasins into his costume, which he obtained through a relationship with the staff of the California State Indian Museum. A photo taken in 1929 also shows him wearing a war bonnet typical of the Plains Indians. His attitude at that time was to \\"give his audiences the tribal regalia they expected\\", and sometimes, he would mix \\"Plains and California regalia to create a suitable image.\\" In the 1930s, he incorporated costume elements more traditional among the Miwok and other California tribes, such as the temakela, a feathered flicker-quill headband, which he made. One of his examples incorporated elements of Pomo, Maidu and Wintun traditions. Dance Brown learned the Eagle Dance from Pedro \\"Petelo\\" O'Connor, a Northern Miwok shaman and healer active from 1910 until his death in 1942. Survival skills Brown would demonstrate survival skills such as arrowhead making, and the use of soaproot as a fish poison. An anthropologist described his technique: \\"First he mashes soaproot bulbs on a stone; he then places the bulbs into a basket and works them into a foam; the foam is poured into Yosemite Creek; and a half hour later he displays the rainbow trout that he caught.\\" Soaproot contains a poison called saponin. In addition to the Miwok, California tribes using this technique included the Lassik, the Luise√±o, the Yuki, the Yokut, the Chilula, the Wailaki, the Kato, the Mattole, the Nomlaki and the Nishinam. He built a replica of a Miwok village next to the Yosemite Museum, which included a sweat house, traditionally used for pre-hunt purification ceremonies.

Founder of Ukrainian classicist prose. He was born in the vicinity of Kharkiv.  Life and work  Hryhorii Kvitka-Osnovianenko was born in 1778 in the village of Osnova, near the city of Kharkiv, to a family of Ukrainian nobility. He adopted the pen name \\"Osnovianenko,\\" a reference to the village of his birth, when he embarked on his literary career. In 1812, G. F. Kvitka-Osnovianenko begins his social activities. He was appointed the director of a new regular lay theatre open in Kharkov. Kvitka-Osnovianenko carried his love to theatre through all his life. Later this feeling made him write theatre drama works. In 1841, he wrote his marvellously interesting \\"Kharkov Theatre History\\".kharkov.vbelous.net/english/famous/fam-art/kvitka.htm Kvitka- Osnovianenko was one of the earliest proponents of Ukrainian as a literary language and began publishing in the first Ukrainian literary journals printed in Kharkiv in the early 19th century. Like most of his contemporaries in the Ukrainian literary scene, he also wrote in Russian. He corresponded respectfully with Taras Shevchenko, keeping up constantly with literary life. He was a friend of Nikolai Gogol, and it is possible that Gogol's play The Government Inspector was inspired by Kvitka-Osnovianenko's satiric drama The Visitor from the Capitol or Turmoil in a District Town, which has a very similar plot and cast of characters. His Ukrainian-language works were mostly burlesque and satirical in nature, but he also wrote more serious prose, such as his sentimental novella Marusia. He started Ukrainian classicist prose with the novella Marusia. According to his own statement about the novella, he wrote it \\"to prove to one unbeliever that something gentle and touching can be written in the Ukrainian language.\\" He also tried his hand at the gothic genre with his \\"Dead Man‚Äôs Easter\\"Krys Svitlana, Between Comedy and Horror: The Gothic in Hryhorii Kvitka-Osnovianenko‚Äôs Dead Man‚Äôs Easter (1834).

In the 1830s, Kvitka composed a fantastic lyrical story about the founding of the city of Kharkov in the middle of the 17th century with his ancestor Andrei Kvitka.

On the one hand, as one of the first popular writers to use the Ukrainian language, he is viewed a founding figure of Ukrainian literature. On the other hand, many prominent Ukrainian scholars, including Ivan Franko, Mykola Zerov, and Dmytro Chyzhevsky, viewed his work as reactionary and conservative and were skeptical of the sentimental, pastoral image that he painted of Ukraine and Ukrainians.

History The Wesleyan Methodist Christian Missionaries http://www.worldgenweb.org/lkawgw/methodist.htm founded the school in 1820.However according to historical researches, the school has been founded by the same Weslyan Methodist missionary, William Ault who had founded Methodist Central College. The school was housed in Joshua Hall (Mrs. Joshua's Hall), Mudaliy√°r Street, Batticaloa during its early years before being shifted to the present premises. In 1895 with the coming of Miss Amy Vincent it was found necessary to start an English section for the benefit of the English-speaking children (16 on the roll). In 1902 a separate English Department was started alongside the Tamil Boarding School. Miss Vincent overworked her strength in establishing the separate English School that took her name, and was invalided home in 1902, where after a painful illness she died in 1905. For the next ten years Miss Hall, Miss Duckering, and Miss Church, all gave short periods of service and, amid constant changes in the staff, the work was carried on with great difficulty. Then in 1911 Miss Florence Fuller arrived, with considerable experience of secondary school work in England. That year Miss G. de la Zilva was admitted into the Training College for specialist training in Kindergarten work. In 1916 three girls appeared for the first time for the E.S.L.C. examination. Miss Laurel Thambimuttu (Mrs. J. W. R. Casinader), the first Vincent girl to pass, later went on to do her London B.Sc. (Economics). In 1921 the Tamil Boarding School was abolished and the English School raised to the status of a graded school. Miss Fuller had given 10 years magnificent service, under great difficulties. When Miss C. Croft (1922-1946) arrived to take over, there were 84 pupils on the roll, and 365 when she retired 24 years later, and this was undoubtedly a period of expansion. Accommodation soon became a difficulty and in 1929 a large Dormitory block was put up. The ground floor had a spacious Prayer Hall, much used by the Boarders and the local Sunday School. In 1928 the School was again upgraded, and in 1932 Eugene Nallaratnam (Mrs. R. Edwards) was the first pupil to be successful in the Senior Cambridge examination. With the arrival from England of Miss O. Champness as Vice-Principal, the Domestic Science and the Art Departments received much attention. The school received much help for its widening curriculum at this time from the first few Indian graduates to join the staff. At the end of the period Miss Croft too was herself giving attention to the organising of Games and Physical Education at Vincent, in addition to all the work involved in supervising a rapidly expanding School and the Hostel.A history of the Methodist Church of Ceylon 1814‚Äì1964, edited by the Rev.

Along with St. Ann's Cathedral in Great Falls, Montana it is the seat of the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings. History =St. Patrick‚Äôs Parish= The first parish in Billings was named St. Joachim, and it was established in 1887. By the turn of the 20th century Billings was in need of a larger church and St. Patrick's was established. The present church building was built in the Gothic Revival style in 1904 for $64,000. An extensive renovation of the church took place in 1954. The altar, communion rail, Stations of the Cross and pews were all replaced with new furnishings. A new rose window graced the choir loft. Interior decorative painting was done in a Byzantine style. Changes were made to the exterior as well. Further modifications were made to the interior of the church in the 1960s and 1970s in response to the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. The side altars and communion rail were removed. The present marble altar, ambo and wood paneling were installed. =St. Patrick‚Äôs Co-Cathedral= Pope John Paul II renamed the Diocese of Great Falls as the Diocese of Great Fall-Billings on February 14, 1980. At that time St. Patrick's Church joined St. Ann's Cathedral in Great Falls as the co-cathedral of the diocese. Further renovations to the cathedral's interior took place in the 1990s. The choir was moved to the front of the worship space. New sacristies and a new gathering space were added to the church.

Before Coronation Lamidi's father, the Alaafin of Oyo Oba Adeyemi II Adeniran, was deposed and exiled in 1954 for sympathizing with the National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC). He had come into conflict with Bode Thomas, deputy leader of the Action Group. Coronation Lamidi Adeyemi succeeded Alaafin Gbadegesin Ladigbolu II in 1970, during the governorship of Colonel Robert Adeyinka Adebayo, after the end of the Nigerian Civil War. In 1975, the head of state General Murtala Ramat Mohammed included Oba Adeyemi in his entourage to the hajj. He was chancellor of Uthman dan Fodiyo University in Sokoto from 1980 to 1992. In 1990, President Ibrahim Babangida appointed him Amir-ul-Hajj in recognition of his commitment to the consolidation of Islam in Nigeria. Political Attachment On 3 May 2011, the outgoing Oyo State Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala announced that the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III was no longer Permanent Chairman of the Council of Obas and Chiefs in Oyo State. The state government had just passed a law that introduced rotation of the office of Chairman between the Alaafin and his two rivals, the Olubadan of Ibadanland and the Soun of Ogbomoso. It was said that the measure, introduced by the state assembly with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) majority, was in response to the Oba's support for the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) during the April 2011 elections. The ACN beat the PDP decisively in that election. Talking in September 1984 he said: \\"Traditional rulers should be seen as the perfect embodiment of the culture of the place, as well as the synthesis of the aspirations and goals of the nation. This is not only in social values of veracity, egalitarianism, justice and democracy; but in dress, utterances and comportment; even the mere necessary trivialities (sic) that mark Nigeria and the locality as a distinctive entity\\". Personal life He is married to Ayaba Abibat Adeyemi, his senior wife. He attends most events with her or with one of the twelve junior wives that he's also married to. His other wives are Ayaba Rahmat Adedayo Adeyemi, Ayaba Mujidat Adeyemi, Ayaba Rukayat Adeyemi, Ayaba Folashade Adeyemi, Ayaba Badirat Ajoke Adeyemi, Ayaba Memunat Omowunmi Adeyemi,Ayaba Omobolanle Adeyemi, Ayaba Moji Adeyemi, Ayaba Anuoluwapo Adeyemi, and Ayaba Damilola Adeyemi.

Donatello's relief of the \\"Assumption of the Virgin\\". The Tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci (or Brancaccio) is a sculptural work in the church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo in Naples, southern Italy, executed by Donatello and Michelozzo around 1426-1428. Built in marble, partly gilt and polychrome, it has a height of 11.60 meters and a width of 4.60. History The work was produced during the partnership of Donatello and Michelozzo, which lasted from 1425 until the late 1430s. It was commissioned when Brancacci was still alive: a letter to him of 5 June 1427 mentions the work as completed for some one quarter. In 1426 the two rented a workshop in Pisa, from where the pieces of the tomb could be more easily shipped to Naples by sea; the city was also nearer to the marble quarries of Carrara. Assistants, including perhaps Pagno di Lapo Portigiani, collaborated to the work, which was completed and sent to its destination in 1428. Description The work is based on a socle from which two composite columns start. They support a round arch with side pendentives decorated by chamfered pilasters and tondo reliefs. At the top is the cusp, in Gothic style with, at the centre, a relief tondo of \\"Christ Redeemer\\" and two statues of puttos with trumpets (an allusion to the biblical Apocalypse and the resurrection of the dead). The tomb itself is enclosed in the architectural frame, supported by three caryatids. The sarcophagus' front has two coat of arms at the sides, and a stiacciato relief of the \\"Assumption of the Virgin\\" executed by Donatello. Above it is the lying portrait of the cardinal and two angels who are opening a stone drapery hanging from the arch. Behind them is a lunette with a bas- relief of the \\"Madonna between Two Saints\\".

It originally aired on SyFy in the United States on August 15, 2011. Plot Claudia and Pete are preparing for a night of inventory. Pete tells Claudia that she should play her guitar at the venue sometime, when her phone rings. The call is from a frantic man who tells her Douglas Fargo relayed her number in case anything went wrong with the beta test. Claudia, Pete and Myka rush to Palo Alto, California to find Fargo and another man, Jerry, plugged into a machine. Gibson, the person who called Claudia, explains that it is a virtual game that malfunctioned; they are now stuck in the game. The men used Beatrix Potter's tea set (an artifact) to make the game work properly. Claudia and Pete enter the game as characters, an elf and a gladiator, respectively, to rescue the two players. They discover the game is a medieval version of Warehouse 13, complete with a rhyming Artie who sends them on a quest to save a princess and a Leena character. They rescue Fargo from quicksand, only to meet an axe‚Äìwielding monster who traps them in the game by taking their controllers. Deciding the only way to escape the game is to finish it, they set out to rescue the princess. The game, however, does not end when they save the princess, a ditzy version of Claudia. As they discover at this point, Jerry is whisked off by the monster. Back in reality, Myka discovers that Beatrix Potter's tea set takes their fears and makes them real in the game. The monster is Jerry's ex- girlfriend, Hannah, to whom he was afraid to propose. Claudia's fear finds her in a mental institution where a doctor tells her she imagined the Warehouse and everyone in it. Ultimately, Myka and Claudia realize the players can only destroy their own fears. Claudia turns an electroshock device on her doctor, and they track down Hannah and send her in so Jerry can propose to the monster, ending the game. In the 'B' plot, Artie and Steve Jinks investigate a mysterious suicide at the request of FBI agent Sally Stukowski. A new painting in the gallery is a lost Van Gogh, which Artie thinks is an artifact because \\"death follows it.\\" Later that night, Jinks and Artie break into the gallery, only to find Stukowski waiting for them. They replace the Van Gogh with one they have copied, then discover the painting is activated by a puff of air after Stukowski sneezes on it and she and Jinks are thrown across the room by a violent wind. The device used to disable the alarm fails, sounding the alarm. Stukowski escapes with the original Van Gogh before the doors shut, leaving Artie and Jinks to be arrested by the police. After their arrest, Stukowski realizes Artie and Jinks are from the police and returns the painting. Once Artie and Jinks leave, Stukowski receives a nod of acknowledgement from a mysterious stranger (Sasha Roiz) and is later seen reporting to an unseen man in a wheelchair. Back at the Warehouse, small fly- like robots emerge from the painting and fly off without explanation. The episode ends with Claudia playing the guitar in the club, as a slow-motion montage of the cast plays on screen.

One negative review came from IGN, which wrote, \\"It tries, and fails, to be a fun video game homage.\\" Other negative aspects included the effect used inside the video game, which was called \\"distracting\\". All reviewers agreed that Allison Scagliotti \\"practically steals the episode\\". Her character performances, from the ditsy princess to the screaming, terrified mental patient, were highly praised.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Steubenville. History Holy Name Parish was founded in 1885. The current structure was completed in 1890 and rebuilt in 1957. It became a cathedral when the Diocese of Steubenville was established in 1945. On June 8, 2008 under Bishop R. Daniel Conlon, Holy Name parish merged with Holy Rosary, St. Anthony, St. Pius X, St. Stanislaus and Servants of Christ the King parishes to form Triumph of the Cross Parish under the leadership of the Rev. Tim McGuire. The parish worships in Holy Name Cathedral and Holy Rosary Church. Bishop Conlon began raising funds to construct a cathedral to house the parish on Steubenville's west side. After raising $8.5 million, he decided in November 2011 that it would be too risky to incur the large debt construction would require and shelved the plan. In June 2013, Conlon's successor, Bishop Jeffrey Monforton, announced that the diocese would retain the current cathedral and renovate it to meet the challenges of the region. His plan included upgraded technology to allow broadcast of Masses and other events to those unable to attend, installing security systems to allow 24-hour visitation and restoring the towers which were removed in a 1957 renovation. He added that when possible, the diocese would employ local residents and firms to perform work and that the diocese would work with nearby Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church and the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County to revitalize the neighborhood. The cathedral was closed in 2014 when renovation plans were announced. In 2018, Bishop Monforton suspended all major expenditures in the diocese until an investigation into the diocesan finance department was complete. A new roof was put on the cathedral in 2019 and interior demolition was planned during the following winter. A final decision on what to do with Holy Name has yet to be made.

She married in 1579 with Count Palatine John I the lame of Zweibr√ºcken. Emperor Charles V had in 1546 granted the Duchy of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg the right of female succession. So, when her brother, Duke John William, died in 1609 without a male heir of his own, both she and William's daughters could play a vital role in the question of who would inherit the important northwest German territory. Magdalene's husband John claimed the inheritance for Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, as did the Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, who was married to Anna, a daughter of Magdalena's sister Marie Eleonore (John Sigismund claimed his marriage contract from 1573 gave him the best claim). The third claimant was Count Palatine Philip Louis of Neuburg, the husband of Magdalen's other sister Anna. Finally, the Duchy of Saxony claimed J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, based on an agreement to that effect with the Emperor. Since all claimants were members of comprehensive European coalitions and so the Habsburgs and France were indirectly involved, an international conflict threatened: the War of the J√ºlich succession. However, after King Henry IV of France died, the conflict could be settled provisionally by the Treaty of Xanten. The duchy was divided between Brandenburg and Palatinate-Neuburg. In the meantime, Magdalena's husband had died in 1604 and his claim had been inherited by her eldest son John II (1584‚Äì1635), who did not receive a share under the Treaty of Xanten. Magdalene's daughter Elisabeth (1581‚Äì1637) married Georg Gustav, Count Palatine of Pfalz-Veldenz. She also had two younger sons: Frederick Casimir (1585‚Äì1645) and John Casimir (1589‚Äì1652). She died in 1633 and was buried in the Reformed Church of Meisenheim.

She was credited with a variety of notable deeds, which are recorded in Pausanias' Description of Greece. Physcoa was believed to have belonged to the very first, legendary set of the so-called Sixteen Women. One of the accounts cited by Pausanias relates that the Eleans suffered much harm from Damophon, tyrant of Pisa, and that after his death people of both Pisa and Elis chose to no longer associate with his misdeeds and to establish mutual peace. For that purpose, each of the sixteen cities of Elis sent a female envoy, \\"this woman to be the oldest, the most noble, and the most esteemed of all the women\\"; one of the delegates was Physcoa. The Sixteen Women performed the establishment of peace, and were subsequently entrusted with management of the Heraean Games, particularly with ritual weaving of the robe for Hera. Another of Pausanias' sources informs that it was Hippodamia who introduced the Heraean Games so as to express gratitude to Hera for arranging her marriage to Pelops, and assembled the Sixteen Women as co- founders of the tradition. There were two choral dances of which the Sixteen Women were in charge, one of them being named after Physcoa, and the other one after Hippodamia. Physcoa was said to have consorted with Dionysus and to have had by him a son Narcaeus. When Narcaeus grew up, it is related, he conquered many neighboring peoples and gained a lot of power; he was also credited with founding the sanctuary of Athena Narcaea. Narcaeus and Physcoa were also reported to be the first people to pay homage to Dionysus as a god.

Rosas was finally defeated by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza in 1852. Urquiza wanted the organization of the country and the promulgation of a national constitution, which Rosas denied. Alberdi stayed in Chile, to keep distance from the political turmoil caused by the fall of Rosas, and began writing the \\"Bases...\\" to propose ideas for the upcoming constitution. He supported federalism and the end of the port of Buenos Aires as the sole international customs of the whole country.

Whereas poetic and musical composition were often combined in the creation of dramatic and poetic works, the dual role of Kirthana(musical text) composer and erudite poet was becoming unusual in the 19th century. U. V. Swaminatha Iyer reports the contempt of his teacher, Pillai, for poets who composed musical works; music was thought to be a distraction from the more important aspects of grammar, poetics and mastery of traditional commentaries.Singing the classical, voicing the modern: the postcolonial politics of music in South India.

Jones This book of 129 pages was first published in the year 1976 by Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. U. V. Swaminatha Iyer Library, Madras, now known as Chennai. In addition, we get to know the poetic brilliance and the unwavering Tamil bhakti of Poet Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, and the high regard the Tamil speaking world idolized him, by reading the first 300 pages of the Autobiography of Dr. U. Ve. Swaminatha Iyer, _En Saritham_. It was to the credit of the Saivite Thiruvaavaduthurai mutt and the then Sannidhanam HH. Subramania Desikar that Poet Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai could sustain despite the severe monetary challenges faced. Another aspect is of the Guru Sishya relation that moves one to tears and shows the dark contrast to the low level, education of our current times have degraded to. A disciple (in the form of U. Ve. Sa) like a calf that has strayed out for a few days, longing for its mother, and The Poet as the searching and longing mother yearning to nourish the calf (his disciple and take care of his Tamil hunger as well as the real hunger). He passed away at Thiruvaaduthurai after ailing for sometime, with his two foremost disciples at the deathbed, Saverinatha Pillai massaging his feet and U. V. Swaminatha Iyer reciting from the Thiruvaasagam. He was an ardent Saivite, but held Kamban and his Ramayanam in the loftiest pedestal. It would be fair to say that in the last 200 years, Pillai has contributed possibly the largest corpus to Tamil poetic literature than any other poet, and by his teaching and through his students brought out the greatness of Tamil literature to the public at large and beyond. Remember all of this literature are aligned to the Yaappu and Ani Illakanam (Poetic grammar) and much before the advent of the new style of poem writing (Pudhu Kavidhai).

Cusset was a student at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Saint-Cloud. He has been an associate researcher at The National Center of Scientific Research (Centre national de la recherche scientifique or CNRS), teacher of contemporary French culture at Reid Hall, and professor at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris. He is the brother of the writer Catherine Cusset.Review of French Theory at Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews How the World Swung to the Right One of Cusset's works is How the World Swung to the Right, a short treatise which examines the ascendancy of Right-wing politics from Cusset's own Left-wing perspective. Taking the election of Donald Trump as his starting point, Cusset describes it as one of many indicators of a rightward shift in world politics which also include Brexit, the governments of Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the conservative regimes of Iran and Saudi Arabia. Cusset describes these situations as the culmination of a fifty-year historical process;How the World Swung to the Right, pp. 7-10. fifty years earlier, the late 1960s were dominated by several \\"Left\\" features such as the pre-eminence of the western welfare state, the French protests of May 1968, the anti-Vietnam War protest movement and the prevalence of communist states. Cusset focuses on the three decades of the 1980s, the 1990s and the 2000s to explain the alleged rightward shift, examining their political and technological developments. The 1980s were characterized by the election of conservative leaders such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl, who implemented neoliberal policies; for example, Thatcher's government opposed the UK miners' strike of 1984-85.How the World Swung to the Right, pp. 26-30. In technology, the decade yielded the personal computer and the businesses which capitalized on its rise, such as Microsoft and Apple. The transition from the 1980s to the 1990s saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, events which prompted thinkers such as Francis Fukuyama (in Cusset's account) to declare the victory of liberal democracy and free market economies over socialist governments. Cusset criticized this view as a form of ex post facto triumphalism. In technology, the 1990s saw the rise of cell phones and the internet. Although the 1990s saw a nascent wave of Left alter-globalization as demonstrated by the Zapatistas and the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, this leftward shift was cut short by the September 11 attacks, the dividing line between the 1990s and the 2000s.How the World Swung to the Right, p. 49. Technologically, the decade produced a refinement of the internet via Web 2.0. In Cusset's account, although technology is a neutral category which can be deployed for any end, its development and use in capitalism reinforce the latter, also precluding Left thought and activity: \\"Incidentally, using our cellphones to measure our heartbeats and the number of steps we take during our morning jog means we are less available to the idea and to the practice of social change. There is also an energetic calculation to this. Energy invested in sports is energy that is taken away from all direct socio-political forms of action.\\"How the World Swung to the Right, p. 90. Cusset concludes the work by examining the \\"period of mourning\\"How the World Swung to the Right, p. 136. in which leftist academics appeared to be discredited, citing examples of formerly leftist thinkers such as David Horowitz and Irving Kristol who \\"exorcised the 'red devil' who had supposedly possessed them in their early youth.\\"How the World Swung to the Right, pp. 123-124. Finally, Cusset proposes \\"countering the Right without seizing power\\", a concept articulated by the sociologist John Holloway, which is closely related to autonomism. Cusset finds the concept at work in the Zapatista movement, Occupy Wall Street, and early 21st century protest movements.

Traditional storage systems distribute a volume across a subset of disk drives in a clustered fashion. The XIV storage system distributes volumes across all modules in 1 MiB chunks (partitions) so that all of the modules' resources are used evenly. For robustness, each logical partition is stored in at least two copies on separate modules, so that if a part of a disk drive, an entire disk drive, or an entire module fails, the data is still available. One can increase the system storage capacity by adding additional modules. When one adds a module, the system automatically redistributes previously stored data to make optimal use of its I/O capacity.

He was a successful businessman until many of his ventures failed during the depression of the 1880s, causing him to return to England for the last decade of his life. He was the son of Archibald Clark. Early life Clark was born in Beith, Scotland, in 1833, the eldest son of the merchant Archibald Clark and his first wife, Margaret McCosh. He was educated at Largs. Archibald Clark decided to emigrate to New Zealand with his third wife and four children; the family left London on the barque Thames on 18 July 1849 and arrived in Auckland on 25 November. He joined the Volunteer Forces and was a captain in the Invasion of Waikato in 1863. Professional life Clark joined his father's company as a partner in 1856 or 1857, and the company was renamed Archibald Clark and Sons. They manufactured clothing and were a wholesaler, at one time employing some 500 staff. Clark became the senior partner following his father's death in October 1875. He was involved in numerous other companies. His investment in the Moanataiari gold mining company made him a rich man. Moanataiari is now a suburb of Thames in the Coromandel. Together with John Logan Campbell, Gustav von der Heyde, John Shera and others, Clark set up the New Zealand Freight Company in 1872, which amalgamated with the New Zealand Shipping Company the following year. All the Auckland shipping owners combined into one company in 1881, the Northern Steam Ship Company, of which Clark was appointed one of the directors. The depression in the second half of the 1880s affected this company, but Clark managed to the secure the services of a new managing director in 1888 who could turn the situation around. Clark was one of the financial backers of business entrepreneur Thomas Russell, who in 1859 had founded the New Zealand Insurance (NZI). The group of businessmen and companies behind Russell became known as the Limited Circle, and they were financing much of the development of Auckland. The funds came from the proceeds of the Thames gold rush. Members of the Limited Circle founded the Bank of New Zealand in 1861 and Clark was on the board of directors. He was president of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce in 1879‚Äì1881. With Josiah Firth, Clark established the Te Aroha Battery Company, a gold mining company. It was one of the many speculative deals which did not go well, and the depression in the second half of the 1880s necessitated a sale, which was done in 1887 incurring a great loss. The Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company was another such venture; it built parts of the Rotorua and Kinleith branches before its collapse. While Archibald Clark and Sons prospered, several other of Clark's businesses failed, and having lost his high standing in society, he took his family back to England in 1889. Political career Mayor of Auckland Clark was a member of the Auckland Provincial Council, representing the Newton electorate on the 6th Council from December 1869 to September 1870. He was Mayor of Auckland from 1880 to 1883. In November 1880, 1881 and 1882, respectively, he was elected unopposed on all occasions. During his term in Office, the first tramway (Horse drawn) was constructed and the site for the Auckland Town Hall was purchased. Clark's council also decided on the site of the library and art gallery, still occupied today by the Auckland Art Gallery. On retiring from the mayoralty, he was given a telescope in appreciation of his services. In 1886‚Äì1887, Clark represented the Grafton ward as a Councillor. Other local body roles included the chairmanship of the Auckland Harbour Board and of the Education Board. Clark stood for Parliament on three occasions. In the 1875‚Äì1876 general election, he was nominated by Thomas Peacock, but unsuccessfully contested the Auckland East electorate against William Lee Rees, polling 266 votes against 300. Clark then contested the Auckland East electorate in the 1879 general election against William Speight and was narrowly defeated with 363 to 371 votes. Clark was re-elected mayor in 1881 and declared that he would not stand in the 1881 general election, as he could not do justice to both commitments, but he changed his mind when it was announced that Sir George Grey would stand in Auckland East. It is said that Clark did not intend to be elected, he merely stood to oppose and defeat Grey. The results were 349 and 315 votes for Grey and Clark, respectively, and Grey was declared elected with a majority of 34 votes. Private life Clark was active in the Presbyterian Church and was the national treasurer for ten years from 1862. In 1865, he purchased The Tower, a large house in Remuera, as his residence. The building is these days part of King's School. He married Kate Emma McCosh Clark (n√©e Woolnough) on 8 April 1875 in Melbourne. Two days later, on a Saturday, the Auckland premises of Archibald Clark and Sons were closed to give staff the opportunity to celebrate the wedding at. His wife was born at Ipswich, Suffolk, England in 1847. She studied art and lived in London, earning a living by undertaking research for writers. After her marriage, along with writing and painting, Kate became an important organiser and contributor to charitable organisations in Auckland. She had five children while they lived in Auckland, and their first son was born on 28 December 1875. After many of Clark's businesses had failed, the family migrated to London. While there Kate Emma McCosh Clark wrote the first New Zealand children's story A southern cross fairy tale, which she partly illustrated, published in London in 1891. Her last work Maori tales and legends (1896), was intended to interest and instruct young people about New Zealand and the Maori. In early 1898, they were making plans to return to New Zealand. Death Clark died on 26 January 1898 at St Leonards- on-Sea. He was survived by his wife and his five children. His wife returned to New Zealand in 1900 and died at Auckland on 3 November 1926.

Described as one of the most graphic documentaries in British TV history, the documentary featured amateur video from the conflict zone filmed by civilians and Sri Lankan soldiers which depicted \\"horrific war crimes\\". The video filmed by civilians included scenes during and after intense shelling of civilian targets, including hospitals, by the Sri Lankan military. The \\"trophy video\\" filmed by Sri Lankan soldiers showed scenes of blindfolded victims being executed and dead bodies of naked women being dragged onto trucks by soldiers as they made lewd remarks about the victims. The documentary also included interviews with civilians who managed to survive the conflict, United Nations staff based in Sri Lanka during the conflict, human rights organisations and an international law expert. The documentary was made by ITN Productions and presented by Jon Snow, of Channel 4 News. The Sri Lankan government has denounced the documentary as a fake and the Defence Ministry produced a documentary named Lies Agreed Upon, countering allegations made in the Sri Lanka's Killing Fields. Sri Lanka's Killing Fields elicited reactions from foreign governments, international human rights groups and various public figures. The film was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for Best Current Affairs documentary and won the Current Affairs ‚Äì International category of the Royal Television Society's Television Journalism Awards 2010/2011. Furthermore, the documentary won two One World Media Awards in 2012 in the categories \\"Television\\" and \\"Documentary\\". In November 2011 Channel 4 announced that it had commissioned a follow-up film Sri Lanka's Killing Fields: War Crimes Unpunished from ITN Productions with new evidence concerning the final days of the conflict, broadcast in March 2012. Background During the final months of the Sri Lankan civil war in 2009 and after its end in May 2009 evidence in the form of video, photographs etc. started emerging showing what appeared to gross violations of international and humanitarian law by both the Sri Lankan military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). British broadcaster Channel 4 was one of a number of foreign media organisations who publicised this evidence. In August 2009 Channel 4 News broadcast video showing naked and blindfolded victims being executed by Sri Lankan soldiers. The Sri Lankan government denounced the video as fake but forensic analysis by independent experts and the United Nations have confirmed that the video is genuine. In November 2010 Channel 4 News broadcast additional video of the same incident. Broadcast details On 3 June 2011 Channel 4 premi√®red a special hour-long investigation into the final weeks of the civil war titled Sri Lanka's Killing Fields at the 17th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. Channel 4 broadcast the documentary to UK audiences on 14 June 2011 at 11:05pm. The documentary was watched by an estimated 700,000 to 1 million viewers and drew a lot of international publicity. In an unusual move Channel 4 waived its international copyright, allowing viewers from outside the UK to view the documentary on its on-demand service and via YouTube. =International broadcasts= The documentary was broadcast in Australia on 4 July 2011 at 8:30pm on ABC1's Four Corners programme.

It was repeated on 9 July 2011 at 10:00pm.

Three cross- party New Zealand MPs (Jackie Blue, Keith Locke and Maryan Street) jointly screened the documentary at the Beehive Theatrette in Wellington on 16 August 2011 to an audience of parliamentarians and political activists. Human Rights Watch and three cross-party Canadian MPs (Patrick Brown, John McKay and Rathika Sitsabaiesan) jointly screened the documentary at the La Promenade Building, Ottawa on 28 September 2011. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and International Crisis Group jointly screened the documentary at the European Parliament, Brussels on 12 October 2011. Content =Interviews= The documentary featured interviews with Benjamin Dix, a British UN worker based in Kilinochchi; Gordon Weiss, the UN's official spokesman in Sri Lanka during the final stages of the civil war; William Schabas, international human rights lawyer and academic; Vany Kumar, a British Tamil who had been trapped in the conflict zone; Steve Crawshaw of Amnesty International; a number of civilians who had been trapped in the conflict zone; and Sinhalese critics of the government. According to Dix from September 2008 there were a number of air raids (by the Sri Lankan Air Force) each day on Kilinochchi, often at night. The Sri Lankan government told the UN that they could no longer guarantee their safety ‚Äì they must leave Kilinochchi and other Tamil Tiger held areas. According to Gordon Weiss the Sri Lankan government regarded the UN as an \\"impediment\\" to their defeat of the Tamil Tigers. By removing the aid agencies from the Tamil Tiger areas there were no longer any international witnesses to the Sri Lankan military's actions, charged Weiss. When the UN announced it was evacuating all its staff from Kilinochchi, hundreds of local civilians, fearing an all-out onslaught on the town by the Sri Lankan military, went to the UN office on 15 September 2008 and pleaded with the UN staff not to leave. Dix filmed the scene on his camcorder: \\"They were pleading with us...'please don't leave'...There was one girl..she wasn't shouting and she wasn't chanting, she was just still but she had real sadness in her face...Her face just really captured this 'have compassion...stay and watch'\\". A Hindu priest pleaded with Dix stay, not to provide food and shelter but to be witnesses: \\"We are begging you to stay and witness our suffering. If we allow you to leave the truth is that everyone here will die. The knife is at our throat.\\" The UN, accepting the Sri Lankan governments warning and ignoring the pleas of the local civilians, left Kilinochchi. \\"It was their greatest hour of need. They had an army sitting on the doorstep...and we drove out. That was ...a real sense of abandonment of these people\\" stated Dix. Weiss believes the UN's decision to leave Kilinochchi to be a mistake. The removal of the UN staff from Kilinochchi left virtually no international witnesses in the area. After the UN had withdrawn, the Sri Lankan military launched a massive offensive into the Tamil Tiger held areas and captured Kilinochchi in January 2009. Hundreds of thousands of civilians fled the onslaught. Over the following four months they were trapped in an ever-decreasing area and constantly bombed by the Sri Lankan military. Tens of thousands died as result of deliberate Sri Lankan military fire. The harrowing ordeal suffered by the civilians was filmed. International human rights lawyer and academic William Schabas believes that mass executions of prisoners was possible evidence of systematic abuse and this could therefore implicate Sri Lanka's political and military leadership in the war crimes of summary executions, killing and torture. The documentary featured an interview with a Sinhalese critic of the government who claimed to have a collection of photographs of summary executions and killings of those who surrendered. He claimed the photos were taken by a high ranking army officer on his personal camera. In one photo there are dozens of dead bodies laid out in rows, many of whom appeared to have been executed. Soldiers are standing around the bodies, some taking video clips using mobile phones. Other photos show the dead, naked bodies of B. Nadesan and S. Pulidevan, two Tamil Tiger leaders who had tried to surrender. Numerous other photos were shown and all the photos were analysed by a forensic pathologist. The pathologist found that \\"there is very high incidence of lethal gunshot wounds to the head raising the strong suspicion of executions at the time of surrender with aimed head shots to stationary, highly visible targets\\" and that there is \\"compelling evidence of systematic executions and likely sexual assault of female prisoners prior to execution\\". =Civilian video= The documentary showed numerous clips from the conflict zone showing the harrowing ordeal endured by civilians. One of the video clips shows the hospital at Puthukkudiyiruppu with government shells firing in the background. Patients are seen lying on the floor with debris all around them. A woman patient laments \\"I was wounded so I came to hospital, and the situation in hospital is like this\\". Another woman cries \\"My legs have been wounded in the shelling. I can't move. I can't get up\\". The shelling intensified and eventually the doctors were forced to abandon the hospital. A number of video clips are shown of civilian camps being shelled and the ensuing terror. In one clip civilians are seen sheltering in a shallow bunker as the area is bombed. \\"Don't take the video\\" a distraught woman in the bunker pleads with the cameraman \\"Please get in the bunker. What are you going to do with the video? They are killing everyone. Please God save all of these children. Can you hear us?\\" =Soldiers' video= The documentary showed a number of video clips filmed by Sri Lankan soldiers on mobile phones, most of which were previously unaired. In the first clip, which was originally broadcast on Channel 4 News on 25 August 2009, armed soldiers are seen abusing naked, blindfolded men (believed to be Tamil Tiger prisoners) with hands tied behind their backs. \\"Straighten up. Fuck you!\\" a soldier shouts as he kicks one of the naked men on his back. Another soldier then shoots the naked man in the head, killing him. \\"It's like he saw. He looked, then he looked away\\" a soldier is heard saying in the background. All the soldiers are speaking in Sinhala. Another shot is heard in the background as the cameraman pans around to show other dead naked bodies, all with blindfolds and hands tied behind their backs. A live naked, blindfolded man with his hands tied behind his back is brought to the area by a soldier and sat down on the ground. The soldier takes a few steps back before shooting the naked man in the head, killing him. \\"Shoot! Shoot! I've shot as well. Shoot!\\", a soldier is heard shouting in the background as more shots are heard in the background. \\"These are our state property. Let's shoot!\\" the soldier laughs. Another soldier is shown shooting a prisoner. This video was authenticated by the UN but the Sri Lankan government maintains it is a fake. In the second clip two men and a woman in civilian clothes but believed to be Tamil Tiger prisoners are shown blindfolded, hands tied behind their backs and sitting on the ground. They are surrounded by soldiers. One of the soldiers is heard egging another soldier (in Sinhala) to shoot the three prisoners. \\"Is there no one with the balls to kill a terrorist?\\" he asks. \\"Of course there is. Shut up!\\" answers another soldier. \\"Come here. What's the matter with you?\\" asks one of the soldiers to another. \\"Hey cunt! Don't be a wimp\\" shouts a soldier. The commanding officer issues orders: \\"Shoot on my command. Up! Take aim! This bugger has a weapon and still seems scared of a terrorist. Aim directly at the head. OK..ready? Up!\\" All three prisoners are shot in the head. According to the documentary this clip has been analysed by experts who say it shows no sign of manipulation and appears to show genuine executions. The clip was taken on 15 May 2009. In one clip a half-naked prisoner is shown tied to a coconut tree with blood over his chest and neck. The documentary then showed photos of the same incident which show the prisoner alive, then threatened with a knife and then dead, draped in the Tamil Tiger flag. According to legal expert William Schabas this scene is strong circumstantial evidence of war crime and torture. In another clip soldiers are shown clearing away dead naked bodies. \\"Mother fucking Tiger wankers!\\" shouts a soldier. \\"Hey...pose with the bodies\\" he continues. In another clip soldiers are shown dragging and dumping dead naked bodies of women, many of which appear to have been abused, onto the back of a truck. One of the soldiers is heard saying \\"She is moaning now\\". \\"Moaning in your head?\\" asks another soldier, \\"Still moaning?\\". \\"This one has the best figure\\" says one of the soldiers of one of the dead woman. In another clip, soldiers are seen standing around dead bodies. One soldier kicks the head of a body. One of the bodies is a naked woman. \\"She looks like someone who's newly joined. She looks like someone's clerk. Look how many pencils and pens she's got. I really want to cut her tits off...if no one was around\\" says a soldier. On 18 May 2011 the Sri Lankan government announced that senior Tamil Tiger commander Colonel Ramesh had died. But video clips taken by soldiers showed Ramesh alive in captivity. A photo then showed the dead body of Ramesh with wounds and blood on his head, the body was identified as Ramesh's by his wife. Channel 4 claimed that this evidence suggested that Ramesh was killed after being captured. Awards The documentary won the Current Affairs ‚Äì International category of the Royal Television Society's Television Journalism Awards 2010/2011. The RTS described the \\"meticulous investigative documentary\\" as \\"a unique, disturbing and convincing account of what was supposed to be a war carried out well away from public view\\". Furthermore, the documentary won two One World Media Awards in the categories \\"Television\\" and \\"Documentary\\". In 2012, the film was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award in \\"Current Affairs\\". Criticism Sri Lanka's Killing Fields has also come under criticism for bias and technical inconsistencies in some of the footage featured.Tekwani, Shyam, \\"The long afterlife of war in teardrop isle\\", Tehelka Magazine, 29 August 2011Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Shyam Tekwani, an expert in terrorism & media at the Asia- Pacific Center for Security Studies who has extensively covered the Sri Lankan conflict, compared the \\"tone and tenor\\" of the documentary to that of productions by the LTTE's propaganda wing, and opined that \\"Clearly an effort to sensationalise and shock with carefully selected and edited footage, the documentary weakens its case and invites an investigation into its own credibility and accountability to journalistic norms. The volume of testimony it uses as evidence is not enormous and most of it is derived from leading questions. The slant is pronounced. Shyam Tekwani's views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies which is part of the United States Department of Defense.\\"Shyam Tekwani, Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies A. A. Gill, reviewing the documentary in The Sunday Times, described the footage shown as \\"unattributed and uncorroborated\\" and wrote, \\"Not a second of this has been shot by Channel 4; none of the eyewitness accounts comes from journalists\\". He criticised Jon Snow's narration as \\"intemperate and partisan\\", and stated that \\"it was all held together by assumptions\\".Not much life in these on-screen deaths, A. A. Gill, 19 Jun 2011. Last Night's TV - Sri Lanka's Killing Fields, Channel 4 Reviewed by AA Gill, Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka), Friday, 24 June 2011 In a technical analysis of the mobile phone footage on behalf of Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, E. A. Yfantis, a professor of computer science at University of Nevada-Las Vegas specialising in computer graphics and image processing, stated that \\"based on mathematical analysis, blood in the 3GP videos is not real blood. It is not clear if the blood in the 3GP scenes is water with red dye or digitally constructed or edited video blood\\" and that \\"videographic and mathematical analysis of the two 3GP videos show that the videos either were edited, or staged, or both‚Äù. He concluded that ‚ÄúCareful analysis of the two 3GP videos which included both frame by frame visual inspection as well as the robust mathematical attributes of the video frames, has led us to the conclusion that this is a very deliberate and orchestrated video\\". The report also detailed the fact that the video file was named \\"produce.3gp\\", suggesting that the video file may have been a result of some form of video editing software. Reaction ‚Äì Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd stated that \\"No-one watching this program could emerge from that undisturbed and we don't either\\". He called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to re-investigate alleged war crimes and examine whether the UNHRC's original findings [resolution A/HRC/S-11/L.1/Rev.2 passed on 27 May 2009] \\"can any longer be regarded as well founded\\". The Australian Senate passed motion number 323 on 7 July 2011 which, amongst other things, noted that the documentary was \\"further shocking evidence supporting allegations of war crimes committed during the 2009 civil conflict in Sri Lanka\\" and called for \\"allegations of war crimes...to be investigated and verified\\". ‚Äì Asked to comment on the documentary, the official spokesman for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated on 15 July 2011 \\"Our focus is on the welfare and the well being of the Tamil speaking minorities of Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka...The sequence of events during the last days of the conflict is unclear. The Government of Sri Lanka would need to go into the matter in greater detail. The concerns that are being expressed in this regard need to be examined\\". ‚Äì The Sri Lankan government denounced the documentary as a fake and the work of the LTTE supporting Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora. Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of the country's President Mahinda Rajapaksa, accused LTTE supporters of bribing Channel 4 to broadcast the documentary, stating \\"pro-LTTE elements have used the Channel 4 news agency after giving money to them [Channel 4] in order to tarnish the image of both the Sri Lankan government as well as the army\\". In a lecture at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo on 24 July 2011 former President of Sri Lanka Chandrika Kumaratunga described her UK-living children's reaction to the documentary: \\"I shall remember till the end of my days the morning when my 28 year-old son called me, sobbing on the phone to say how ashamed he was to call himself as Sinhalese and a Lankan, after he saw on the UK television a 50 minute documentary called Killing Fields of Sri Lanka. My daughter followed suit, saying similar things and expressing shock and horror that our countrymen could indulge in such horrific acts.\\" ‚Äì British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt issued a statement on 15 June 2011 in which he expressed shock at horrific scenes in the documentary. Burt stated that the documentary, along with other evidence, constituted \\"convincing evidence of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law\\" and urged the Sri Lankan government \\"to give a serious and full response\\". ‚Äì In the United States, Congressman Jim McGovern, co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, described the contents of the documentary as \\"a gruesome example of humans at their worst\\". He went on to say \\"These scenes provide much more than simply shock value, however: They also are powerful evidence of the need for an independent investigation to hold those responsible accountable for the crimes...If the Sri Lankan government is unable or unwilling to act, then the international community must respond in its place\\". Aftermath Part of the broadcast aired on Channel 4 News in August 2009 inspired the music video and artwork to the M.I.A. song \\"Born Free\\" released in May 2010. Other activists including Jan Jananayagam of Tamils Against Genocide expressed support for the film. Between 14 June 2011 and 4 July 2011 the British TV regulator Ofcom received 171 complaints about the documentary. The majority of the complaints were that the documentary was misrepresentative and misleading rather than that the contents of the documentary were fake as suggested by the Sri Lankan government. The levels of complaints automatically triggered a formal investigation by Ofcom (Ofcom had received 13 complaints up to 13 June 2011 which were all rejected as the documentary hadn't been broadcast yet). In October Ofcom dismissed all complaints. Dismissing the complaints of impartiality, offensiveness and misleading material, Ofcom concluded that \\"overall Channel 4 preserved due impartiality in its examination of the Sri Lankan Government's actions\\", \\"the audience was not materially misled\\" and that \\"the images included in this programme, whilst brutal and shocking, would not have exceeded the expectations of the audience for this Channel 4 documentary scheduled well after the watershed with very clear warnings about the nature of the content\\". On 1 July 2011 Swarnavahini, a privately owned Sri Lankan TV station, broadcast on their Live at 8 programme what they claimed to be an unaltered version of a video used on the Channel 4 documentary showing uniformed men summarily executing eight bound and blindfolded men. In the version broadcast by Swarnavahini the men in uniform were speaking in Tamil whereas on the Channel 4 documentary they were speaking in Sinhala. This Tamil version was in fact not new ‚Äì it had appeared on YouTube shortly after Channel 4 News had originally broadcast the Sinhala version on 25 August 2009. An investigation by a UN commissioned panel of independent experts found that the Sinhala version was authentic. Kandanam Jegadishwaram (Nandavanam Jagatheeswaram), a British national of Tamil origin, was arrested on 4 July 2011 for allegedly supplying Channel 4 with video which was used in the documentary. The police alleged that 71 CDs were found at Jegadishwaram's residence in Kandy. Jegadishwaram was brought before Colombo Magistrate‚Äôs Court on 8 July 2011 where the Criminal Investigation Department accused him of causing \\"disrepute to the country and the army by providing alleged videos to the Channel 4 television\\". The magistrate allowed the CID to detain and interrogate Jegadishwaram until 2 August 2011. The magistrate released Jegadishwaram on 2 August 2011 after it was revealed that he was not involved and that no suspicious material or evidence was found. In August 2011 Indian TV channel Headlines Today broadcast a two-part documentary titled Inside Sri Lanka's Killing Fields. The first part was broadcast on 9 August 2011 on the channel's Ground Zero programme and subtitled I Witnessed Genocide. The second part was broadcast on 10 August 2011 on the channel's Centre Stage programme and subtitled Lankan Army killed 40,000 Tamils. The documentary makers travelled to Vanni and interviewed witnesses to the last stages of the civil war who described \\"serious violations of international conventions and laws on the prevention of war crimes\\". In November 2011, Channel 4 announced that it had commissioned a follow-up film Sri Lanka's Killing Fields: War Crimes Unpunished from ITN Productions with new evidence concerning the final days of the conflict. This documentary was broadcast on 14 March 2012 at 10:55pm to coincide with the 19th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. Sri Lanka Ministry of Defence produced a documentary named Lies Agreed Upon, as a response to counter the allegations made in Sri Lanka's Killing Fields.

The script keeps close to the classic French novel. The director treats all the classic characters with respect, not making fun of any of them, although there is humour when d'Artagnan rides his peculiar horse and when Planchet supplies wine for the heroes. The film's location shots were made in Bois de Boulogne, around and in the Ch√¢teau de Guermantes in Seine-et-Marne and in Semur-en-Auxois (department C√¥te-d'Or). The settings, costumes and props are very elaborate and give the impression of historical accuracy. Bernard Borderie and his crew demonstrated here already the qualities which later contributed substantially to the success of his series of five costume drama films about Anne Golon's heroine Angelique. Since Bernard Borderie had already made several Lemmy Caution films he was an expert for fighting scenes. In comparison to the likewise brilliant fencing the dancer Gene Kelly (An American in Paris, Xanadu) had provided as ‚Äúd'Artagnan‚Äù in an earlier adaptation, the fencing in this film looks less like dancing and more dangerous. But Borderie also knew how to present a fist fight. When d'Artagnan defends Mme Bonacieux against a couple of the cardinal's thugs, the director does not only use dramatic sound effects but furthermore lets Barray's punches look more explosive by taking out frames very precisely when he is about to hit. He is also capable of making us believe an outnumbered man could really win the day if only certain circumstances are given, because in Borderie's films the thugs are often so overly keen on decking the hero that they actually hinder each other to succeed.

It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration. Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities, the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing. The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance. The principle was to \\"restore\\" a church to how it might have looked during the \\"Decorated\\" style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360, and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations. It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement, varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding. Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration, and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation, such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. In retrospect, the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light. Background The west front of Lichfield Cathedral as restored by George Gilbert Scott A number of factors working together led to the spate of Victorian restoration. From the time of the English Reformation onwards, apart from necessary repairs so that buildings might remain in use, and the addition of occasional internal commemorative adornments, English churches and cathedrals were subjected to little building work and only piecemeal restoration. This situation lasted for about 250 years with the fabric of many churches and cathedrals suffering from neglect. The severity of the problem was demonstrated when the spire of Chichester Cathedral suddenly telescoped in on itself in 1861. The unrestored interior of the Puritan Chapel, Bramhope, West Yorkshire In addition, ever since the mid-17th century Puritan reforms which were typified by a minimum of ritual and decoration and by an unambiguous emphasis on preaching there had been an ongoing removal of any emotion or colour from English religious services as a means of distancing itself from what was seen as the excesses of Catholicism.Mari 2010, p. 66. But towards the end of the 18th century the burgeoning Gothic Revival and interest in medievalism encouraged people to seek more interest in their religious services. The popularity of the Gothic Revival was seen by Church officials as a way to reverse the decline in church attendance, and thereby start to reassert the Church's power, prosperity and influence. They therefore pushed for massive restoration programs.Mari 2010, p. 7. As a third factor, the industrial revolution had resulted in many people living in cities that had few churches to cater for their religious needs‚Äîfor instance Stockport had a population of nearly 34,000 but church seating for only 2,500.Port 2006, p. 22. The rise in dissenter denominations, such as Methodism and the Religious Society of Friends, was seen as further evidence of this shortfall.Port 2006, pp. 17‚Äì18, 24. To fulfil this need, between 1818 and 1824 the Government had granted ¬£1.5 million for building new churches.Mari 2010, p. 30. Known as Commissioners' churches, most of them cost only ¬£4,000 to ¬£5,000 each to build, and dissatisfaction with their indifferent design and cheap construction provoked a strong reaction.Clark 1962, pp. 98, 107. Equivalent movements existed in most of Europe, especially northern Europe, with the French architect and architectural historian Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc especially associated with the French manifestation. Driving forces =The Cambridge Camden Society= One of the main driving forces for the restoration of churches was the Cambridge Camden Society (CCS), which was founded in 1839 by two Cambridge undergraduates, John Mason Neale and Benjamin Webb, as a club for those who shared a common interest in Gothic church design.Clark 1962, pp.155, 160‚Äì1. It rapidly became popular: its membership increased from 8 to 180 in its first 12 months.Eastlake 1872, pp. 196‚Äì7. Although initially a society for recording and discussing medieval church features, the members of the CCS soon began to expostulate in their journal The Ecclesiologist and particularly in their Few Words to Church-builders of 1844 that the only \\"correct\\" form for a church building was the \\"middle pointed\\" or \\"Decorated\\" style,Clark 1962, p.170‚Äì1. in which churches had been built during the hundred years centred on 1300. Ecclesiology obviously struck a chord in society: it was closely linked with the ongoing interest in medievalism and the Gothic Revival.Eastlake 1872, p. 187. The CCS's firm insistence on one style being correct proved to be a beacon for those who were no longer able to judge for themselves what was \\"good\\" in architecture‚Äîthe certainties of the Vitruvian rules having lost their power during the Romantic movement that had been in vogue since the middle of the 18th century.Clark 1962, p. 160. The CCS stated that there were two possible ways in which a church could be restored. As Kenneth Clark put it, they said that one could \\"either restore each of the various alterations and additions in its own style, or restore the whole church to the best and purest style of which traces remain\\".Clark 1962, p. 173. The Society wholeheartedly recommended the second option and since virtually every medieval church had at least some small remnant of decorated style, maybe a porch or even just a window, the whole church would be \\"restored\\" to match it. And if the earliest portions were too late, then it was a candidate for a complete rebuild in the \\"correct\\" style. \\"To restore,\\" The Ecclesiologist declared, \\"is to revive the original appearance ... lost by decay, accident or ill-judged alteration\\". They did later admit, though, that such \\"restoration\\" might create an ideal state that the building had never been in. =Oxford Movement= Church restorations were also strongly influenced by the Oxford Movement, which advocated moving the centre of importance in the church from preaching to the sacrament of the Eucharist: from the pulpit to the altar. Consequences of this included moving the pulpit from a more central position to the side of the church, replacing box pews with open pews, creating a central aisle to give a better view of the altar, and the removal of galleries. Another consequence was that a larger chancel was required for the associated ritual. St Peter's, Berkhampsted, with Butterfield's restorations Activities Persuaded by the Cambridge Camden Society that Decorated Gothic was the only correct style, and by the Oxford Movement's theories concerning the nature of worship, a spate of \\"restoration\\" was soon under way. Some figures give an idea of the scale. A total of 3,765 new and rebuilt churches were consecrated in the forty years up to 1875, with the most active decade being the 1860s in which there were more than 1,000 such consecrations. Over 7,000 parish churches in England and Wales ‚Äì which is nearly 80% of all of them ‚Äì were restored in some way between 1840 and 1875.Mari 2010, p. 34 quoting Miele 1995, p. 156. There were 150% more people identified as professional architects in the 1871 census than in 1851 ‚Äì it is known that established architects passed small restoration jobs on to their newly qualified colleagues, since such work provided good practice.Miele 1995, p. 159. The retention of original material (carving, woodwork, etc.) tended to be of little importance to the early restorers: appearance was all, and much good old work was discarded to be replaced by modern replacement in the chosen style.Clark 1962, pp. 172‚Äì3, p. 211; Mari 2010, p. 3. Different architects had different degrees of sympathy with original material, and as the century progressed greater care was generally taken; this was at least partly as a result of the increasingly louder voices that were raised in opposition.Mari 2010, p. 4. As an example of the type of work undertaken in one church, in 1870‚Äì71 the Church of St Peter, Great Berkhamsted was the subject of a restoration programme by William Butterfield, whose other works included churches such as All Saints, Margaret Street in London. Butterfield's restoration involved the removal of some original features, including the obliteration of paintings on the pillars. The most substantial structural changes involved raising both the roof and the floor of the chancel, raising the roof of the south transept to its original pitch, removing the vestry, incorporating the south porch into the south aisle and removing the door, re- flooring the nave, installing new oak benches and replacing an earlier gallery. Butterfield also installed clear windows in the clerestory, allowing more light to enter the nave. He extended the aisles by knocking down the dividing walls of two chambers at the west end. On the exterior of the church, Butterfield removed the crumbling stucco that had been added in 1820 and re- faced the church walls with flint flushwork. At Lichfield Cathedral, the 18th century had been a period of decay: the 15th-century library was pulled down, most of the statues on the west front were removed, and the stonework covered with Roman cement. After some structural work early in the 19th century by James Wyatt, the ornate west front (pictured above) was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It includes many ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, created from original materials where possible and new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Wyatt's choir-screen had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create the clergy's seats in the sanctuary. A new metal screen by Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip to designs by Scott was installed, as was a Minton tile pavement stretching from choir screen to altar, inspired by medieval tiles found in the Choir foundations. Practitioners Famous architects like George Gilbert Scott, Ewan Christian, William Butterfield and George Edmund Street became enthusiastic \\"restorers\\" and the wave of restoration spread across the country so that by 1875 something like 80% of all churches in England had been affected in some way. The nave of Bath Abbey ‚Äì Scott's stone fan vaulting that replaced the ancient wooden ceiling to the original design by Robert and William Vertue. In 1850 Scott wrote a book A plea for the faithful restoration of our Ancient Churches, in which he stated that \\"as a general rule it is highly desirable to preserve those vestiges of the growth and history of buildings which are indicated by the various styles and irregularities of its parts\\". However he did not follow this principle in practice, generally sweeping away all later changes and reconstructing the church in a uniform early style, sometimes on the evidence of just one remaining early feature. Opposition There were opponents. The Reverend John Louis Petit was a staunch and well respected opponent from his first book, Remarks on Church Architecture (1841) until his death in 1868. The Archaeological Society was founded in 1845 by Antiquarians anxious to bring the love of old buildings to a wider audience. Although John Ruskin was generally in favour of new buildings in an early Gothic style,Eastlake 1872, p. 273. in 1849 he wrote in The Seven Lamps of Architecture that it was not possible \\"to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture\\". The Society of Antiquaries of London urged in 1855 that \\"no restoration should ever be attempted, otherwise than ... in the sense of preservation from further injuries\\". A later vociferous opponent was William Morris who campaigned against the proposed restoration of St John the Baptist Church, Inglesham in the 1880s and started the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) in 1877 when he heard of the proposed restoration of Tewkesbury Abbey by Scott. The principles espoused by SPAB took some time to attract support, but the policy of putting \\"Protection in place of Restoration\\" eventually took hold, and are adhered to today. Morris also wrote in 1877: William Morris, who strongly opposed restoration Despite his opposition, though, it is known that Morris profited greatly by his firm's provision of stained glass to many restoration projects,Mari 2010, p. 26. and it has been noted that his criticism only started after his firm was securely established as a supplier to these projects.Miele 1995, p. 153. Further opposition came from evangelical Protestants, who believed that \\"ornamental carved work, decorative painting, encaustic tiles, and stained glass were foolish vanities which lead the heart astray\\",Eastlake 1872, p. 190‚Äì1. and from others who were concerned about the cost: \\"For the cost of one stone church with a groined roof, or even an open timbered roof, two might be built in brick with plaster ceilings; and who could dare to say that worship in the plainer building would be less devout or sincere than that which was offered in the other?\\" Not all Catholics were in favour either: late in his life Cardinal Wiseman made it clear that his preference was for Renaissance art, as might be expected of a religious order of Italian origin.Eastlake 1872, p. 347. In retrospect From a 20th-century perspective the process of Victorian restoration has often been viewed unfavourably, with terms such as \\"ruthless\\", \\"insensitive\\" and \\"heavy-handed\\" being commonly used to describe the work done.See, for instance, Reed 1997, p.338: \\"Much of his [George Gilbert Scott's] restoration work was undoubtedly insensitive, heavy-handed, and ruthless\\"; and \\"... prior to a ruthless Victorian restoration ...\\" In the introduction to his book The Gothic Revival (first published in 1928), Kenneth Clark wrote \\"The real reason the Gothic Revival had been neglected is that it produced so little on which our eyes can rest without pain\\".Clark 1962, p. 7. Clark also reckoned that Decorated Gothic was the worst of the three possible styles that could have been adopted‚Äîthe others being Early English which had \\"very little detail which an ordinary craftsman could not manage\\", and Perpendicular which was \\"infinitely the most adaptable of medieval styles\\". Clark pointed out that Decorated was the most difficult to execute,Clark 1962, pp. 171‚Äì2. not least because of the complicated window tracery that set it apart from the other two Gothic styles. However, not all restoration work was purely negative: a side effect of a number of restorations was the rediscovery of long-lost features, for instance Anglo-Saxon carving that had been incorporated into Norman foundations, or wall-paintings that had been whitewashed over, at St Albans Cathedral. It is also true to say that had they not been restored many churches would have fallen into disrepair.Reed 1997, p. 338.

The application allows the user to store the credentials of other users with whom they interact, and to encrypt files such that only a specified user can decrypt them. In the same manner, if a file is received from another user and its credentials are saved, the receiver can verify the authenticity of that file and decrypt it if necessary.

The development has been picked up by OpenKeychain.  Reception  After its initial release in June 2010, it has gained a strong following with over 2000 reviews and over 100,000 installs from the Google Play store. Several tutorials have been written which instruct new users in how to set up APG on an Android phone. These tutorials generally reference APGs interaction with the K-9 Mail Android e-mail client. = OpenKeychain = Between December 2010 and October 2013 no new version of APG was released.

A student, then instructor, at the Saint-Cyr military academy, he fought for the French Army against the Italians in the Alps. After the Fall of France, he led the Maquis des Gli√®res, organizing attacks and parachute drops, and was the recipient of multiple military awards including the Croix de Guerre. He was killed in action at the end of a successful commando raid. He is memorialized at Saint-Cyr and by the French scouting movement.  Youth and military career  Morel was born into a family of the Lyon bourgeoisie. His father was the son of a Lyon silk industrialist and his mother was from a family of Savoie jurists and soldiers. He was well schooled by the Lyon Jesuits where he was a Scout de France and patrol leader (1st Lyon, externat St Joseph), and moved towards a military career. At the Versailles private school of Sainte- Genevi√®ve took the trial for the Saint-Cyr military academy, in which he enrolled in 1935 (promotion 1935-1937 Mar√©chal Lyautey). On finishing in 1935 he was appointed sub-lieutenant, and chose to be assigned to the 27th battalion de chasseurs alpins of Annecy. He then took high-altitude training at Chamonix and became leader of the section d'√©claireurs skieurs (SES), which he turned into a first-class fighting force. In November 1938, he married a woman from Annecy, Marie-Germaine Lamy. In May 1939, the 27th BCA was stationed on the Italian border, with Morel's SES just above Val d'Is√®re. In September 1939, while his battalion left for the Eastern front, the section commanded by Morel (who had been promoted to lieutenant) remained guarding the Italian border. After the Italians entered the war on 12 June 1940, he distinguished himself in the battle of the Alps, decisively exploiting the success of one of his patrols to take five prisoners and seize important supplies. He was decorated with the croix de Guerre and obtained his first citation. Injured on June 18, he remained at the head of his section. On 20 and 22 June he fought near the Petit-Saint-Bernard col where his action forced the Italian troops to withdraw. He received a second citation, then was made Knight of the chevalier de la L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur. He was still only 24 years old. Morel then served in the Army of the Armistice at Annecy under commandant Vallette d'Osia and participated in the sequestering of weapons and supplies. In 1941 he was appointed instructor at Saint-Cyr, which had moved to Aix-en- Provence in the zone libre. Here he quietly encouraged his pupils to join the French Resistance.  Resistance and the Gli√®res Plateau  After the invasion of the zone libre by the Germans in November 1942, Tom Morel went underground, and joined the resistance in Haute-Savoie where he found his old commander, Vallette d'Osia, organizer and head of the Arm√©e Secr√®te (AS) for that department. He signed up, along with Vallette d'Osia's old adjutant Captain Maurice Anjot, to organise the AS, whose numbers were multiplying after the February 1943 initiation of the STO, the scheme of obligatory labour in Germany. In September 1943, Vallette d'Osia was arrested by the Germans who had recently replaced the Italians in occupying Savoie. Vallette d'Osia's successor was Captain Henri Romans-Petit, organiser and head of the AS in Ain. Romans-Petit appointed Morel head of the Maquis in the department, and gave him the task of organizing the receipt of allied parachute drops on the Gli√®res Plateau. On 31 January 1944, Morel occupied the plateau with 120 maquisards. By the end of February, he had approximately 300 men under his orders, whom he organized into three companies. Morel was distinguished by his talent as a leader and trainer of these men who had come from varied geographical, social and political backgrounds. He took up the doctrine of \\"live free or die\\", and disciplined his battalion to turn it into unified and effective force in the fight for liberation. In February and March, numerous clashes occurred with the Groupe mobile de r√©serve (GMR) and with the Milice of the Vichy r√©gime who were surrounding the plateau. On 2 March, Morel decided on commando operation against the Beau S√©jour hotel at Saint-Jean-de- Sixt where the GMR were stationed. Thirty of them were taken prisoner. They had to provide currency in exchange for Michel Fournier, medical student and auxiliary doctor for the maquis, who had been arrested at le Grand-Bornand several days earlier. The prisoners were freed but, in spite of the agreement on the honour of the Annecy police intendent, Fournier was not released. Thereafter, the Maquis benefited from the arrival of 120 fighters from Chablais and Giffre. Morel decided to lead another operation, more significant and hazardous, against the staff of the GMR, \\"Aquitaine\\", in Entremont at the foot of the Gli√®res Plateau. Couret, officer of the peace and interim commandant of the GMR, had not performed his duties regarding the resistance, and his superior, commandant Lefebvre, who had arrived on 7 March, refused to speak to the Maquis. Over 100 men took part in the operation on the night of March 9‚Äì10. One of the groups, commanded directly by Morel, succeeded in taking the h√¥tel de France where the GMR staff was based. The maquisards disarmed their prisoners, but Lefebvre pulled out a concealed gun, and fired on Morel at close range, shooting him directly in the heart. Morel collapsed dead. Lefebvre was killed immediately. Morel's body was brought up to the plateau where he was buried on 13 March after a moving religious ceremony. On 2 May, his body was brought down to the valley, and he remains buried today in the Morette military cemetery, now the Gli√®res en Haute-Savoie national necropolis. Morel's tomb at the Morette Necropolis, 2009  Posterity  On 5 November 1944, General Charles de Gaulle awarded Morel the posthumous title of croix de la Lib√©ration. The citation was as follows: The 174th promotion from the Saint-Cyr academy was named Lieutenant Tom Morel in his honor.See pr√©sentation de la promotion Lieutenant Tom Morel on the La Saint-Cyrienne website Morel's personality was summarized by Pierre Golliet in the book Gli√®res - Haute-Savoie - Premi√®re bataille de la R√©sistance - 31 janvier - 26 mars 1944 (by Golliet, Pierre, Helfgott, Julien et Louis Jourdand 1946): In October 1995, the new dormitory of the Saint-Cyr military academy was named the Tom Morel building. http://pagesperso-orange.fr/coldo/CPersonnalites.htm The barracks of the 27e BCA carries the name of Tom Morel.

Readership of his blog went from 2,800 readers during the week prior to Palin's pick, to 92,000 readers in the week leading up to the November 2008 presidential election. \\"Saradise Lost\\" was later used by Eric Boehlert in his 2009 book on political bloggers, Bloggers on the Bus:How the Internet Changed Politics and the Press, as the title for the chapter on Alaska political blogging, which discussed Munger's blogging activities along with those of other prominent Alaska bloggers credited with pioneering reporting on Palin's candidacy. =Anti-creationism efforts and Sarah Palin case= New Scientist magazine named eight scientists as heroes and two as villains, under the title \\"Science heroes and villains of 2008.\\" Munger is also listed there as one of three \\"non-scientists who deserve special mention\\" along with Barack Obama. Munger was credited \\"for doing his bit to counter creationism\\" by confirming the beliefs of U.S. Republican nominee for vice president, Sarah Palin, that \\"dinosaurs and humans coexisted 6000 years ago.\\"Science heroes and villains of 2008 New Scientist Magazine In his September 28, 2008 article titled, \\"Palin treads carefully between fundamentalist beliefs and public policy\\", reporter Stephen Braun wrote, after Sarah Palin was elected as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, she startled University of Alaska Anchorage professor Munger who criticized Palin in recent years on his blog \\"Progressive Alaska\\" for her creationist beliefs she expressed during a conversation with him. Such notions, related to a common theme of \\"Young Earth creationism,\\" claim that God created the world about 6,000 years ago, including the contention that dinosaurs and humans coexisted. Most scientists say about 66 million years passed after the extinction of dinosaurs and appearance of the first primitive hominoids. In June 1997, he watched her speech at a graduation ceremony for small group of home-schooled students at an Assembly of God church, where Munger had been conducting the college band. He asked her \\"Sarah, how can you believe in creationism? Your father's a science teacher.\\" She replied that the two \\"don't have to agree on everything.\\" Afterward Munger \\"pushed her on her understanding of the earth's creation, whether it was really less than 7,000 years old and whether dinosaurs and humans walked the earth at the same time,\\" referring to debunked claims regarding Texas fossil tracks dating back tens of millions of years. According to Munger, Palin replied that \\"she'd had seen pictures of human footprints inside the tracks,\\" contending that dinosaurs and humans supposedly walked the Earth at the same time, contrary to prevailing scientific views.Palin treads carefully between fundamentalist beliefs and public policy, Los Angeles Times, Stephen Braun, September 28, 2008. Retrieved 7 May 2017.Sarah Palin, Wasilla, book banning, Salon.com, David Talbot, Sept 15, 2008 Munger further claimed he asked Palin if she ascribed to the End of Days belief in which the Messiah will return while earth is in total chaos. He said, \\"She looked in my eyes and said, 'Yes, I think I will see Jesus come back to earth in my lifetime'.\\" See also * Rachel Corrie * The Skies are Weeping * My Name is Rachel Corrie * Phil Goldvarg * Linda McCarriston References External links * The Lionel Show \\"Lionel welcomes Philip Munger, editor of the Progressive Alaska blog\\" radio recording * Burning it up at both ends ClubHooligan.com * The Juneau Symphony * Review of the Anchorage Youth Symphony, Anchorage Daily News December 2, 2008 * Alaska artists put shows on the road Anchorage Daily News, Published, October 16, 2005, by Mark Baechtel * An interview with composer Phillip Munger by Tamra Spivey and Ronnie Pontiac published in Newtopia Magazine 'Ideology' - Vol.III, Issue 18 September-October 2004 * The Skies are Weeping Biography of Philip Munger * The Skies Are Weeping - The November 1, 2005 London Performance Protest Music of Philip Munger Lyrics and Recordings available at Philip Munger's blog * GarageBand Knik Philharmonic Orchestra Recordings of Knik Philharmonic Orchestra uploaded by Philip Munger * Philip Munger's Statement October 9, 2005 * Blue America Welcomes Philip Munger January 3, 2009, Autobiography at firedoglake.com Category:1946 births Category:Alaska Democrats Category:American bloggers Category:American fishers Category:American male composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Alaska Category:Oberlin Conservatory of Music alumni Category:People from Cordova, Alaska Category:People from Palmer, Alaska Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Alaska Anchorage faculty Category:University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:American male bloggers Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Philip Munger"},{"id":"33130706","text":"Darvish Mohammed Khan was the Khan of Sheki (1524-1551).

The home was built between 1867‚Äì68 by Friedrich Huster and sold to Charles Klein after completion. The house is named for Klein's daughter Caroline Wahrenberger, who was deeded the house in 1882. Since it was built, the house has served as a residence for several generations of the Klein‚ÄìWahrenberger family, and was the location for two German‚ÄìAmerican schools. At different times, both Pat Morris Neff and Sam Rayburn lived in the residence when Mrs. Wahrenberger ran it as a boarding house. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Travis County, Texas in 1978, and was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1972. Architecture Originally a two-story limestone residence when it was built in 1867‚Äì68, this house erected by Friedrich Huster has undergone a few changes. Both the main unit, as well as its separate one-story kitchen facility, were topped with a gabled roof. When Charles Klein acquired the residence, he added a second story and a one-story front porch. In 1916, a two‚Äìstory gallery that had been added in 1887, was removed in favor of a two‚Äìstory portico with columns. Later changes covered the limestone walls with stucco, in all but the north section of the house. 1946 was the last year the house served as a private residence. Leased property Klein, and later his daughter, operated the house as a lease property. The German‚ÄìAmerican Ladies College was operated in the house 1874‚Äì1879, under the management of Natalie von Schenck and Alice Nohl. In 1880, Klein leased the premises to Jacob Bickler, founder of the Texas German and English Academy. Bicker was the nephew of educator Philip Bickler who ran the Bickler German‚ÄìEnglish Academy in Austin. Jacob Bickler began the Texas German and English Academy in 1876, and in 1880 began operating the academy out of the Wahrenberger House. He later moved the academy to the larger Texas Military Institute Castle in Austin, but Bickler himself retained the lease on the house until 1886. On November 9, 1881, the old Texas Capitol was destroyed by fire. Due to their close proximity to the capitol building, Bickler and his students responded to the fire by rescuing many of the historical records housed in the Capitol. Bickler was still leasing the property in 1882 when Klein deeded it over to his daughter Caroline Wahrenberger. Her husband, local businessman John Wahrenberger, died in 1864, leaving Caroline with four children to support. After the Bickler lease ended, Wahrenberger lived in the residence and ran it as a boarding house. Notable among the boarders were future Texas governor Pat Morris Neff and future Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Sam Rayburn. At the time, Rayburn was a student at the University of Texas Law School. After Caroline Wahrenberger died in 1916, her daughters Mary and Josephine inherited the property. They, in turn, passed the property to their heirs. In 1946, the house became a business property.

The Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni is a Renaissance sculpture in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, Italy, executed by Andrea del Verrocchio in 1480-1488\\\\. Portraying the condottiero Bartolomeo Colleoni (who served for a long time under the Republic of Venice), it has a height of 395 cm excluding the pedestal. It is the second major equestrian statue of the Italian Renaissance, after Donatello's equestrian statue of Gattamelata (1453). History In 1475, the Condottiero Colleoni, a former Captain General of the Republic of Venice, died and by his will left a substantial part of his estate to the Republic on condition that a statue of himself should be commissioned and set up in the Piazza San Marco. In 1479 the Republic announced that it would accept the legacy, but that (as statues were not permitted in the Piazza) the statue would be placed in the open space in front of the Scuola of San Marco. A competition was arranged to enable a sculptor to be selected. Three sculptors competed for the contract, Verrocchio from Florence, Alessandro Leopardi from Venice and Bartolomeo Vellano from Padua. Verrocchio made a model of his proposed sculpture using wood and black leather, while the others made models of wax and terracotta. The three models were exhibited in Venice in 1483 and the contract was awarded to Verrocchio. He then opened a workshop in Venice and made the final wax model which was ready to be cast in bronze, but he died in 1488, before this was done. He had asked that his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, who was then in charge of his workshop in Florence, should be entrusted with the finishing of the statue, but the Venetian state after considerable delay commissioned Alessandro Leopardi to do this. In 1496, the statue was erected on a pedestal made by Leopardi in the Campo SS. Giovanni e Paolo, where it stands today.Passavent pp. 62-3 Description Another view Verrocchio based the sculpture on Donatello's statue of Gattamelata, as well as on the ancient statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, the St. Mark's Horses in Venice, the Regisole (a late antiquity work in Pavia, now lost), and the frescoes of the Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood by Paolo Uccello and of the Equestrian Monument of Niccol√≤ da Tolentino by Andrea del Castagno. The main problem he had to face was of statics: representing the horse while moving, with a raised leg, could cause stability problems due to the excessive weight of the bronze being supported only by three relatively thin legs. Donatello, in his monument at Padua, had partially solved the problem by putting the raised leg on a sphere. Verrocchio was the first to solve the problem in having the horse supported by three legs. Although it was not placed where Colleoni had intended, art historian Passavent emphasised how fine it looks in its actual position, writing that \\"the magnificent sense of movement in this figure is shown to superb advantage in its present setting\\"Passavent p.65 and that, as sculpture, \\"it far surpasses anything the century had yet aspired to or thought possible\\".Passavent p.62 He points out that both man and horse are equally fine and together are inseparable parts of the sculpture. Verrocchio is unlikely to have ever seen Colleoni and the statue is not a portrait of the man but of the idea of a strong and ruthless military commander \\"bursting with titanic power and energy\\".Passavent p.64 This is in contrast to Donatello's statue at Padua of the condottiere known as Gattamelata with its \\"air of calm command\\" and all Verrocchio's effort \\"has been devoted to the rendering of movement and of a sense of strain and energy\\".  Copies  In 1909 an electrotype copy of the statue was made for the cast and copy sculpture collection of what would become the National Museum in Sczeczin, Poland. That copy was moved to Warsaw in 1948, were it was eventually installed outside the Academy of Fine Arts as an inspiration to students. In 1992 the City of Sczeczin petitioned for the return of the copy, which was granted in 2001, and in 2002 it was installed in Szceczin's Plac Lotnik√≥w (Airmen's Square) and unveiled by the President of Sczeczin and Colleoni's descendant, lawyer Guardo Colleoni. A condition of the return of the copy to Sczeczin was that a copy of that copy be made to remain outside the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, where a bronze copy of the electrotype copy stands today.

Like the SAIs in many other countries across the world the institution is established by the Constitution of Bangladesh. This institute is responsible for maintaining accounts of the republic and audits all receipts and expenditure of the Government of Bangladesh, including those of bodies and authorities substantially financed by the government. The reports of the CAG are discussed by the Public Accounts Committee, which is a standing committee in the Parliament of Bangladesh. In more recent times, in addition to carrying out the traditional approach of conducting financial audits and compliance audits, the office of the comptroller and auditor general Bangladesh has introduced performance audits, which focus on evaluating economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the management of public resources of different government entities. Constitutional mandate Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh office building. Audit Bhaban, 77/7, Kakrail, Dhaka - 1000, Bangladesh. The Constitution of Bangladesh provides the CAG of the country with absolute independence; hence, he is not answerable to any other authority to gain access to all documents required while conducting an audit. Article 127‚Äì132 of the constitution of the country illustrates the establishment, functions, terms of office and so on of the Auditor General. On 11 May 1973, the first Comptroller and Auditor-General was appointed by the government of Bangladesh. Current CAG Mohammad Muslim Chowdhury is the current CAG of Bangladesh. Former CAGs # Late Fazle Kader Muhammad Abdul Baqui (11 May 1973 to 31 December 1975) # Osman Ghani Khan (1 March 1976 to 31 December 1982) # A K Azizul Huq (1 January 1983 to 29 March 1989) # Gholam Kibria (30 March 1989 to 31 December 1991) # Khondkar Moazzamuddin Hossain (7 March 1992 to 29 March 1996) # M.

Each of the Directorates is headed by a Director General. Audit observations involving considerable financial anomalies are primarily included into Advance Paras (AP). Later considering adequately the responses of the auditee organisation and the concerned Principal Accounting Officer (often the concerned Secretary of the Ministry) Advanced Paras might be transformed into Draft Paras (DP). The DPs form part of the audit reports if it is justified and approved by the CAG of Bangladesh. The audit directorates are: * Commercial Audit Directorate * Local and Revenue Audit Directorate * Civil Audit Directorate * Works Audit Directorate * Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate * Railway Audit Directorate * Post, Telegraph and Telephone Audit Directorate * Defence Audit Directorate * Mission Audit Directorate * Performance Audit Directorate Activities =Financial audit= A financial audit performed by the OCAG attempts to evaluate whether the financial statements of public sector entities are fairly stated in accordance with Accounting Standards. The OCAG is developing capacity to become fully compliant with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI's). =Compliance audit= A compliance audit performed by the OCAG attempts to evaluate whether the activities of public sector entities are in compliance with the relevant existing laws, rules and regulations. The OCAG is developing capacity to become fully compliant with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI's). =Performance audit= With the increasing realisation of the necessity to appraise the three E's ‚Äì Economy, Effectiveness and Efficiency ‚Äì of the public resources used, OCAG incorporated performance audits in recent years. In addition to the traditional compliance audits, Performance Audit was launched by OCAG to make sure the accountability of the executive to the Parliament and, in effect, to the taxpayers. Public Accounts Committee (PAC) The Comptroller and Auditor General in compliance with the Rules of Business submits the audit reports to the president of the country after apprising the Prime Minister. The Auditor General's reports are later discussed by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Parliament. The PAC's activities involve scrutinising important observations and comments of the Auditor General's reports while giving hearing to the concerned officials. The outcome of the PAC meetings includes the responses of the ministries and executive agencies along with the recommendations of the Committee, which is often considered obligatory to the executive departments to conform. OCAG generally has a role to enable the PAC to function effectively. It almost throughout the time gives the necessary support to the PAC. Human resources The skill and academic background of the OCAG staff is varied with the managerial staff of the office boosting diverse expertise. The diversity is often considered to be of great use in carrying out audit activities of the office. At present, approximately four thousand officers and staff are working in the OCAG, and an estimated thirteen percent of the total workforce is women. However, the female representation in the staff level is considerably higher than that in the managerial level. Financial Management Academy (FIMA) Financial Management Academy (FIMA) is the training wing of OCAG Bangladesh, the supreme audit institution of the country. This Academy is established aiming at providing the much needed know- how to enhance professionalism of both the officers and staff of Audit and Accounts Department. The responsibility of the institute is to add value to the skills of the employees of the department. The institution offers necessary auditing, accounting and financing knowledge to the employees of the department in an effort to ensure sound financial management of the country. International co-operation OCAG Bangladesh, the supreme audit institution of the country, is an active member of Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI) and International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) for a long period now. SAI Bangladesh is fully committed to the goals of these organisations and has recognised the necessity of international collaboration for excellence.

The Lords had blocked the Supply Bill, the so-called People's budget of 1909, which Lloyd George had introduced to increase taxation, and increase welfarism. The Parliament Act 1911 was introduced to curb the powers of the House of Lords. Despite opposition it went through, after threats were made by the Liberal Government that they would advise the King to pack the Lords with 500 new Liberal Peers, which he would have difficulty in refusing under constitutional measures in place, despite the obvious outrageous behaviour of the government. It presented a fait accompli to the Lords by removing their 900 year-old right to block Bills coming up from the House of Commons. No longer could the Lords forestall legislation. The new power to delay was restricted to a period of two years only. Many of the \\"Last Ditchers\\" or \\"Die-Hards\\" were Tory farmers, landowners, and aristocracy, who opposed the social 'equalitarian' reforms made by Liberal Governments in government and the judiciary since at least 1880, eroding the traditional political power that went with aristocratic social superiority. The inexorable rise of business and merchant middle-class capitalists in the second half of the nineteenth century appeared to reach a climax during the Edwardian era. Their entry into the Commons, assisted by the enfranchisement of the working-classes in the 1884-5 Reform Acts, had already marked a significant shift of power.

The temple is dedicated to Goddess Sharadamba. It is more popularly known as SVBF Canada or Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundation Canada. The temple is modelled after the original 8th- century Sringeri Sharadamba Temple located at Sringeri in Chikkamagaluru District in Karnataka, India. History Built at a cost of $11 million, the temple was consecrated with waters from more than 250 rivers from around the world on Sunday, June 20, 2010. Over 10,000 devotees joined in the consecration in which priests scaled the temple's gopuram and poured sacred water over its carved facade. The Maha Kumbhabhishekam ceremony was recorded for live and delayed broadcast by several TV channels, including ATN, Tamil One, Omni Television, Vision TV, TV Asia, STAR News, Jaya TV and others, as well as numerous radio and print media, giving the event global coverage. On the occasion the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, \\"The complex stands as a testament to Canada's and India's proud traditions of pluralism. This place of worship is an important landmark and a fitting tribute to the Hindu community's place in Canada's cultural landscape.\\" Architecture Ceremonial Passageway pictorially depicting the life of Adi Shankaracharya on the side walls The temple has a rajagopuram following the style of South Indian temple architecture. It occupies about 30000 sq ft. of land, with marble and granite imported from India. The 3 main features of the temple are a 30 ft. Gopuram, an 18 ft. Mandapam and a ceremonial passageway depicting the main events in the life of Adi Sankaracharya. The temple has an occupancy of about 500 persons. The granite and marble flooring of the temple is provided with heating for the winter. The Sringeri Community Centre was inaugurated on 13 December 2008 and the newly renovated temple was inaugurated on June 20, 2010. SVBF Canada aims to propagate universal values of higher learning and personal development for communities across Canada based on the age old Indian traditions. It is apt to recognize that the name \\"Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundation\\" was chosen to bring the blessings of the current 36th Acharya Jagadaguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal and the previous 35th Acharya Jagadaguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Mahaswamigal. There are eleven shrines inside the temple dedicated to the following deities: * Goddess Sharadamba * Lord Ganesha * Chandramouli * Adi Shankara * Radhe Krishna * Lord Rama * Durga Devi * Hanuman * Lord Kartikeya * Lord Venkateswara * Navagraha The Complex also houses a huge banquet hall, Adi Shankara Museum, Adi Shankara Library, Adi Shankara Vidyalaya offering free classes on music, bhajans, Sanskrit shlokas Vedas and many more faculties.

The two spires (North and South) are virtually one granite massif, split by a deep cleft formed by jointing and erosion. The shapes of these spires are attributed to ice wedging, cleaving along master joints by soil acids, and perpetual weathering.  North Early Winters Spire  Elevation: 7,760 ft/ 2,366 m First ascent: May 28, 1950/. Wesley Grande, Pete Schoening, and Dick Widrig.  South Early Winters Spire  Elevation: 7,807 ft/ 2,380 m First ascent: July 20, 1937. Kenneth Adam, Raffi Bedayn, and W. Kenneth Davis were credited in their report of first ascent however, only Bedayn and Neil Ruge appear in the summit register. Climate The two spires (north on the left) Early Winters Spires are located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from the northeast side of the spires drains into Early Winters Creek which is a tributary of the Methow River, whereas the southwest slope drains into a tributary of the Chelan River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Earlier, when informed of his award over the phone, he requested to share a beer with President Obama. The president accepted the offer and they each drank a bottle of the ale on the patio outside the Oval Office. Former president Thomas Jefferson, who lived in the White House between 1801 and 1809, is known to have brewed beer himself, particularly after his retirement. He has been called \\"America's first microbrewer\\", but there is no evidence that it happened within the White House. Petition Official recipe as described. On August 21, 2012, at least two Freedom of Information Act requests were sent to the White House seeking the recipe of the White House Honey Ale from California attorney Scott Talkov and Texas attorney Brodie Burks, both home brewers. On August 29, 2012 during a brief Q&A; session on Reddit, President Obama announced he would release the recipe, stating \\"It will be out soon!

Gravity, alcohol by volume, bitterness and color are within the guidelines for a Belgian Dubbel, however the English hop and yeast selection are not in keeping with the Belgian Dubbel style.

In 1868, his family moved to Beaumont, Texas where his father created the Long Shingle and Saw Mill and later moved to Waco, Texas in 1887. On November 20, 1877, he married Underhill Mixson which was the first church wedding conducted in Beaumont and later had three children with her. He worked as a foreman at his father's company and in 1877, his father, John Gilbert, and him created the Beaumont Lumber Company and by 1892 he had risen to become president and general manager of the company. In 1900, they sold the company to John Henry Kirby. In 1892, he invested $1,000 into Pattillo Higgins's Gladys City Oil Company and was elected as its president due to him being the only investor to give capital instead of land. Carroll became rich after the company discovered oil at Spindletop. In 1901, he and his father both gave Baylor University $75,000. On December 14, 1935, Carroll died from pneumonia in a YMCA building that he had helped to create in the 1920s.

Photo includes 18-volume third edition of 1797 plus two-volume supplement dated 1803. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition (1797) is an 18-volume reference work, an edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. It was developed during the encyclopedia's earliest period as a two-man operation initiated by Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, in Edinburgh, Scotland. Most of the editing was done by Macfarquhar, and all the copperplates were created by Bell. History of the edition The third edition was produced between 1788 and 1797. Colin Macfarquhar, the editor of volumes 1 - 12, up to \\"Mysteries,\\" died in 1793, age 48, of \\"mental exhaustion\\". His heirs were bought out by Bell, who became sole owner of Britannica. Bell hired George Gleig, later Bishop Gleig of Brechin (consecrated 30 October 1808), to carry on the job as editor for the remainder of the third edition. James Thomson worked with Gleig on the editorial side. Gleig then also edited the 1801 and 1803 supplements. The third edition was expected to occupy three hundred weekly numbers (1 shilling apiece), collected and bound in thirty parts (10 shilling, sixpence each) in fifteen volumes with 360 plates; but, by the time it was completed, it occupied 18 volumes with 14,579 pages and 542 plates.Paul Kruse, \\"The Story of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1768‚Äì1943\\" (PhD thesis, 1958), page 67. The third edition established the foundation of the Britannica as an important and definitive reference work for much of the next two centuries. With nearly double the scope of the 2nd edition, Macfarquhar's encyclopedic vision was finally realized. This edition was also very profitable, yielding ¬£42,000 profit on the sale of about 10,000 copies. The 3rd edition began the tradition (continued to the present) of dedicating the Britannica to the reigning British monarch, then King George III; describing him as \\"the Father of Your People, and enlightened Patron of Arts, Sciences and Literature\\", Gleig wished Like the second edition, the volumes were written over a long period, from volume 1 in 1788 to volume 18 in 1797. Unlike the second edition, the title pages were not printed with their volumes but were printed and sent to subscribers when the set was complete, and dated the year of completion. All volumes of the 3rd edition have title pages dated 1797. The encyclopedia continued to be printed, in complete sets, for many years, with all the volumes still dated 1797. In addition to the legitimate sets printed in Edinburgh, unauthorized sets were being printed in Dublin by James Moore and Philadelphia by Thomas Dobson. In Edinburgh, 10,000 complete sets were printed, according to Robert KerrRobert Kerr, Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Correspondence of the Late Mr William Smellie (1811) i. 364‚Äì5. or 13,000 copies according to Constable. In addition, there were 2,000 copies of Dobsons and an unknown number by Moore.\\"Archibald Constable and His Literary Correspondents: A Memorial,\\" ii. 312, this quote and reference itself were taken from the 11th edition of Britannica in the article \\"Encyclopedia.\\" By contrast, only 1,500 copies of the second edition were printed, all unbound.Herman Kogan, \\"The Great EB, \\"The Story of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica\\" (1958), page 21. The quality of the printing appears better than in previous editions. The final page of each volume of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica contains \\"Directions\\" to the binder for the correct placement of the 500+ copperplates and maps. Nevertheless, some sets of the Third edition had the text and plates bound in separate volumes: the first 18 volumes containing the text, and volumes 19 and 20 all of the copperplates and maps. In 1797, Fath Ali Shah was given a complete set of the Britannicas 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include \\"Most Formidable Lord and Master of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica\\". Content and contributors Illustration of William Herschel's Grand Telescope of 1789. Thomas Thomson was recruited by Britannica in 1796 to amend the Chemistry article, which had been written, probably by Tytler, using archaic ideas and terminology. Before beginning to re-write the entire article for the supplement, he authored this chart, to be used as an appendix to the article in the 3rd edition, showing the new nomenclature that Lavoisier, et al. had introduced in 1787.This chart, which measures 15\\" by 22\\" and folds up several times to fit in the volume, was sent with instructions that it be bound at the end of the Chemistry article in the main encyclopedia. This whole story can be read in detail in the preface to the 7th edition, as well as in David Brewster's article for the Edinburgh Review, which he wrote reviewing the 7th edition when it was published in 1842 Several noted authorities contributed to this edition, such as Dr. Thomas Thomson (brother of James) who introduced the first usage of chemical symbols in the 1801 supplement (see below), and John Robison, Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who wrote on natural philosophy. The 3rd edition is also famous for its bold article on \\"Motion\\", which regarded Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation as erroneous. Instead, authors James Tytler and Gleig wrote that gravity is caused by the classical element of fire. They seem to have been influenced by William Jones's Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy (1762), which in turn was based on John Hutchinson's MA thesis, Moses' Principia, which was written in 1724 but rejected by Oxford University. Nevertheless, Gleig was sanguine about the errors of the 3rd edition, repeating William Smellie's sentiment in the 1st edition quoted in the main article: The maps in the 3rd edition are outdated, as they are the same maps that were used in the first edition of 1771 and second edition of 1784. Second edition of 1784. The preface is in vol. 1 but was dated 1797, so it apparently was sent with the title pages to bookbinders that year. It was written by Gleig, which names the authors of some of the longer articles. In it, Gleig states, \\"Aerology, Aerostation, Chemistry, Electricity, Gunnery, Hydrostatics, Mechanics, with most of the separate articles in the various branches of natural history, we have reason to believe were compiled by Mr. James Tytler, chemist; a man who, though his conduct has been marked by almost perpetual imprudence, possesses no common share of science and genius.\\" Tytler's contributions stop in fact at the letter M. Tytler's very long article in the second edition on Medicine, \\"was revised and improved for the present by Andrew Duncan, M.D., fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and Professor of the Institutes of Physic in the University.\\" He also states that Motion was written by himself and Tytler. The only color plate to appear in the third edition, is hand-colored. The blue represents the horizon, the green in the center is the city of Chester, England, and the red is the river Dee. The list of authors goes on, \\"Mary Queen of Scots, Instinct, Love, Metaphysics, Miracle, Moral Philosophy, Oath, Passion, Plastic Nature, Polytheism, Prayer, Slavery, and Supper of the Lord were contributed by Gleig, editor of the last 6 volumes.\\" Blind was written by Dr. Blacklock and Dr. Moyes, who were both blind. Education was written by Mr. Robert Heron; Grammar and Theology were written by Gleig and the Rev. James Bruce; Music by Dr. Blacklock; History of Art by Wm. Maxwell Morrison; Mysteries, Mythology and Philology by David Doig; Navigation, Parallax, Pendulum, Projection, Ship Building, and Naval Tactics by Andrew Mackay; and John Robison is credited with Physics, Pneumatics, Precession, Projectiles, Pumps, Resistance of fluids, Roof, Rope making, Rotation, Seamanship, Signals, Sound, Specific Gravity, Statics, Steam, Steam Engine, Strength of materials, Telescope, Tide, and Water Works. Philosophy was written by Gleig and Robison; Physiology by Dr. John Barclay; French Revolution by Gleig and Mr. Forsythe; and the articles Oxygen and Phlogiston were written by John Rotheram of St. Andrews. There is a color plate, opposite page 208 in volume 1, named \\"2nd plate II\\" in the Aerostation article, although it was printed in B&W; and colored by hand.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 3rd edition, 1797, page 208 The aerostation article describes balloon flight from 1783 to 1788, but Tytler does not mention his own balloon flights of 1784. Tytler's earlier treatise on balloon flight, written in 1784, appeared in the 200-page appendix to the second edition, in Volume 10 under \\"Air\\". Unauthorized editions The first American encyclopedia, Dobson's Encyclop√¶dia, was based almost entirely on the 3rd edition of the Britannica and was published at nearly the same time (1788‚Äì1798), together with an analogous supplement (1803), by Scottish printer Thomas Dobson. Dobson, an Edinburgh native and master printer who learned his craft in that city while the first two editions were being produced there, relocated to America in 1783. The first United States copyright law was passed on 30 May 1790--although anticipated by Section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution (ratified 4 March 1789)--but did not protect foreign publications such as the Britannica. Unlicensed copying of the Britannica in America became a problem again in the 9th edition (1889). Illegitimate copies of the 3rd were also sold in Dublin by James Moore under the title, Moore's Dublin Edition, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica; this was an exact reproduction. By contrast, Dobson's work had various corrections and amendments for American readers, especially in the supplement. Supplements After the death of Macfarquhar, Andrew Bell was sole owner of Britannica. His son-in-law Thomson Bonar set about to produce a supplement to update the encyclopedia. Two volumes were produced in 1801 to supplement the Third edition. A second edition of the two volumes, \\"with improvements\\", was printed in 1803. Both versions were printed by John Brown, Anchor Close, Edinburgh. In both versions, the articles are ordered alphabetically and the volumes contain about 800 pages each. The 1803 edition has A-I in volume 1 and I-Z in volume 2. A new article on Chemistry, 190 pages in length, written by Thomas Thomson of Edinburgh, is meant to completely replace the 261-page article in the main encyclopedia, written by James Tytler. Much new information about oxygen, combustion, and disproof of the phlogiston theory had been discovered since Tytler's day, and are explained in the supplements. A new and quickly growing list of chemical elements and their compounds was replacing the former system, which contained only the elements earth, air, water, and fire. Thomson also wrote new articles on Mineralogy, Combustion, and a 90-page article named Substances, all pertaining to Chemistry.from the preface to the second volume of the 1803 edition of the Supplement. Thomson went on to write the article Chemistry for the 7th edition of Britannica, 40 years later. George Washington, who does not have his own article in the Third edition, has a 4-page article in the Supplement. John Robison of Edinburgh wrote new articles: Arch, Astronomy, Carpentry, Center, Dynamics, Electricity, Impulsion, Involution and Evolution of Curves, Machinery, Magnetism, Mechanics, Percussion, Piano-Forte, Position, Temperament, Thunder, Trumpet, and Watchwork. The French Revolution is also given a continuation, by Gleig. The two volumes of the Supplement contain 50 copperplates, none of which were produced by Bell. Bonar retained sole ownership of the supplement's copyright. In the creation of the 4th edition of Britannica, which Bell started in 1800, none of the work from the supplements could be used, as Bell did not have the copyright, and Bonar wanted too much money for his liking. This event caused a feud between Bonar and Bell which was never resolved during Bell's lifetime.Kogan, \\"The Great EB\\", page 26 Bell died in 1809, and the 4th edition was completed the next year. Upon Bell's death, one of Britannica's major distributors, Archibald Constable, bought the encyclopedia, and also obtained Bonar's copyright by making him part owner of Britannica.

The passionate rivalry between these two Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools, located about apart, dates to their first college football game in 1893, and has continued across all sports, with the men's basketball series gaining particular attention in recent years. The football rivalry was once a trophy game known as the Battle for the Barrel, with the victors keeping a painted wooden beer barrel, one half each painted in Vol orange the other in Wildcat blue, until the next contest. The barrel tradition was mutually discontinued in 1998 following a fatal alcohol-related car crash involving two Kentucky football players. Football Basketball In contrast to the football series, Kentucky has generally dominated the basketball rivalry. The two teams first played in 1910.Trease, Danny (2002) Tales from the Kentucky Hardwood, p. 96. Sports Publishing. . For the first couple decades the series was often back and forth, and the rivalry became particularly heated in the 1930s and 1940s, when the Volunteers were coached by John Mauer. Mauer had previously been the coach of Kentucky until he was let go and replaced by Adolph Rupp, adding additional bitterness to the rivalry. Under Mauer, the Volunteers held their own against the ascendant Wildcats.Randy Moore (2005), Hoop Tales: Tennessee Volunteers Men's Basketball, pp. 13-16. Globe Pequot. . However, from 1945 to 1960, Kentucky won 31 out of 32 games, including a series-record 20 consecutive wins from 1950 to 1960. In the 2010s, the rivalry was relatively even, with the Wildcats holding a s slim 13 to 8 lead. In the last 15 meetings, the Volunteers have won eight games. Overall, Kentucky and Tennessee have met for a total of 230 times and Kentucky has the winning advantage of 156-74. One particularly notable game was the 1972 match-up at Tennessee. Kentucky had won the previous game by two points, but Ray Mears' Tennessee team surprised the league by achieving the best record to that point. If Tennessee won, they would be sole SEC Champions and receive the conference's bid for the NCAA Tournament; however, a Kentucky win meant a shared SEC title, with Kentucky receiving the tournament bid via tiebreaker. Kentucky won the game 67-66 after a last minute missed Tennessee free throw, splitting the conference title and taking away Tennessee's hopes of a tournament bid.Wallace, Tom (2002) Kentucky Basketball Encyclopedia, p. 196.

Printed during the Western Xia (1038‚Äì1227), circa 1139‚Äì1193, it is thought to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type. The book is currently held at the Ningxia Institute of Archaeology in Yinchuan, and because of its historical significance it has been included in the list of 64 Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad that was issued by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2002.  Discovery  The Baisigou Square Pagoda was situated in a remote location in the Helan Mountains, about 10 km from the nearest road. On 28 November 1990 a local peasant discovered that the pagoda had collapsed in ruins; subsequent investigation revealed it had been blown up by unknown criminals, apparently with the intention of stealing any historical relics inside the pagoda. In August of the following year an expedition led by archaeologist Niu Dasheng (ÁâõÈÅîÁîü) (b. 1933) from Ningxia Museum carried out archaeological investigations at the site. The archaeologists uncovered a large number of artefacts, concentrated in a small area in the middle of the collapsed pagoda, under about a metre of rubble, which they determined must have come from chambers in the tenth and twelfth stories of the otherwise solid pagoda. The artefacts comprised coins, silk cloth, woodblock prints of Buddhist images, miniature moulded clay sculptures of stupas and Buddhas, wooden tablets inscribed in ink with Tangut characters, a handwritten scroll 5.74 m in length written in cursive Tangut characters, and more than thirty volumes of printed books and manuscripts in both Chinese and Tangut, including the nine volumes of the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union. Description An open folio from the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union, showing gaps in the perimeter lines that are typical of movable type printing. The Auspicious Tantra of All- Reaching Union found in the ruins of the pagoda is incomplete, comprising three complete volumes from the main text, and four complete and two partial volumes from supplementary parts of the book: * Auspicious Tantra of All- Reaching Union (3 vols.): volumes 3, 4 and 5 (out of 5 volumes in total); * Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union: Essential Text (1 vol.); * Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union: Broad Meaning Part B (1 vol.); * Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union: Supplementary Explanations (4 vols.): volumes 1, 2, 3 and 5 (vols. 2 and 3 only partially preserved). The book is printed on paper, and the paper for the main body of text is made from ramie and hemp fibres. The volumes were bound using the \\"butterfly binding\\" method whereby each sheet was folded in half inwards and pasted together at the fold (the opposite of traditional stitch binding where the sheets are folded in half outwards and stitched together at the opposite end of the fold). When opened up, the dimensions of the print area of each folio are 30.7 mm √ó 38.0 mm. The book title and page number are printed on the central fold of each folio, with the page numbers written in either Tangut or Chinese or a mixture of Tangut and Chinese. Each half-folio comprises ten vertical lines of 22 Tangut characters. Printing Detail of a page from the Auspicious Tantra of All- Reaching Union showing an inverted Chinese characters ÂçÅÂõõ \\"fourteen\\" in the centre fold. There are a number of characteristic features of the book indicating that it was printed using movable type, such as the gaps between the perimeter lines at the corners, and between the centre fold lines and the top and bottom perimeter lines, this being due to the print frame being made of loose pieces of wood rather being carved from a single block of wood as is the case with woodblock printing. Even more tellingly, characters are sometimes inverted, which is typical of books printed with movable type, but cannot accidentally occur in woodblock editions. That it was printed using wooden type rather than clay type is indicated by the occasional presence of uneven lines between the columns of characters, which were left by bamboo strips used to set the wooden type (but which were not used for setting clay type). This is not the only Tangut book thought to have been printed using wooden movable type, and there is supporting evidence for the use of movable type printing during the Western Xia in some other Tangut books. For example, in the colophon at the end of the Tangut translation of the Flower Garland Sutra there are references to printing using \\"loose characters\\", and to the printer \\"selecting characters\\". Furthermore, on the credits to a Buddhist sutra dated 1216 it is stated that it was printed by an \\"Office of Movable Printing\\". Nevertheless, it is thought that the Auspicious Tantra of All- Reaching Union is earlier in date than any of the other surviving Tangut books that may have been printed using movable type. The book itself does not provide a date of publication, but on the basis of dated books (latest book dated 1180) and other dateable artefacts found together with the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union in the ruins of the Baisigou Square Pagoda, the book is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Western Xia (1139‚Äì1193). It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type anywhere in the world. Textual transmission The Auspicious Tantra of All- Reaching Union is a unique copy of an otherwise unknown Tangut translation of a Tantric Buddhist text, comprising the main text of the Tantra in five volumes, together with several volumes of commentaries and other supplementary material. The start of each volume of the main text credits the original translation of the text from Sanskrit into Tibetan to the Indian pa·πá·∏çita GayƒÅdhara (d. 1103) and the Tibetan translator 'Gos Khug-pa Lhas-btsas, and the subsequent retranslation from Tibetan to Tangut to a Tangut monk called Piputifu (Chinese ÊØóËè©ÊèêÁ¶è). Thus, the Tangut text is believed to be a retranslation from Tibetan of an original translation of a Sanskrit text. Tangut scholars originally did not know which Tibetan text the book was translated from, and thought that it was probably an unknown lost text. However, Tibetologist Shen Weirong has suggested that the Tangut title of the book is a translation of the Tibetan dpal kun-tu kha-sbyor zhes-bya ba'i rgyud (Glorious Tantra of Everlasting Union). Although there is no extant Tibetan text with that title, there is a commentary on a text which includes precisely this title. In the Sanskrit title of this commentary, however, the Sanskrit equivalent of the Tibetan dpal kun-tu kha-sbyor zhes-bya ba'i rgyud is given as ≈örƒ´ Sa·πÉpu·π≠a NƒÅma Tantra, which indicates that the Glorious Tantra of Everlasting Union is a synonym for the Sa·πÉpu·π≠a Tantra. The Tibetan translation of the Sa·πÉpu·π≠a Tantra is extant, and is called Yang-dag-par sbyor-ba zhes-bya ba'i rgyud chen-po (Great Tantra of Perfect Union). According to Shen, the contents of part of the fourth volume of the Tangut Auspicious Tantra of All- Reaching Union that were translated into Chinese by Sun Changsheng in 2005 are basically the same as the corresponding section of the Tibetan Great Tantra of Perfect Union.

Her father wished for all his children to learn a profession, so she learned to manufacture various forms of ornaments. Though telephone wires were invented before her, the way to make them was not known in Sweden, so the Swedish telephone network depended on foreign manufacturers. Hammarstr√∂m managed to develop telephone wires by herself with the knowledge she learned by making ornaments out of metal strings. She started her own factory, and in 1883 took over the task of providing telephone wires to the Swedish telephone company. She had a monopoly on the production through the 1880s and 1890s. In her factory in Stockholm, she employed only women, whom she educated herself. In 1886, she was awarded first prize for her invention at a machinery exhibition in Stockholm. She manufactured wires for several telephone factories.

She was previously the Camden London Borough Councillor for Regent's Park from 2010 until 2014. Early life Siddiq is the daughter of economics professor Shafiq Siddiq, and Sheikh Rehana, who gained political asylum in the UK as a teenager. They met when Shafiq Siddiq was studying for a PhD and married in Kilburn in 1980. She has an elder brother, Radwan \\"Bobby\\" Mujib, and a younger sister, Rupi. Siddiq was born in St Helier Hospital in St Helier, London. When she was 15, the family moved to Hampstead. She was raised a Muslim and has said that her \\"family embraced multicultural Britain\\". In the heart of North London's Jewish community, she attended seder with neighbours and went to Limmud. As a child, she met Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Mother Teresa, and her family was invited to the White House. She attended The Royal School, Hampstead, before completing her undergraduate degree in English Literature at University College London and then a master's degree at King's College London.

Bravely Default was originally released in 2012, while an expanded edition titled For the Sequel released in 2013 in Japan, Europe and Australia, and in 2014 in North America. Square Enix published the game in Japan, while Nintendo handled publishing duties overseas. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system and job system, in addition to incorporating options to combine job abilities and adjust battle speed and random encounter rates. Bravely Default is set in the world of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four elemental crystals protected by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a religious group with influence across the world. Agn√®s Oblige, vestal of the Wind Crystal, is forced to begin a journey to awaken the crystals after they are consumed by darkness. Allying with Tiz Arrior, the sole survivor from Norende, amnesiac Ringabel, and Eternian defector Edea Lee, Agn√®s sets out to awaken the crystals and confront a greater evil responsible for events. Starting development as an action role-playing sequel to Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light, it retained elements from the Final Fantasy series while having its own story and gameplay elements. The producer of The 4 Heroes of Light, Tomoya Asano, returned to produce Bravely Default. The story's writer was Naotaka Hayashi, who was brought in from 5pb. due to his work on Steins;Gate. The characters designs were handled by multiple artists, including art director Akihiko Yoshida and Atsushi ≈åkubo. The game was influenced by western video games and television series, and individual elements were inspired by aspects of the Dragon Quest series and Higurashi When They Cry. The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended to evoke the feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa. Bravely Default was first announced in September 2011 as part of Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the platform. In the run- up to release, multiple demos were developed, and the team adjusted the game using feedback from players. For the Sequel was the version chosen for overseas release, being localized without any subtitle. In both Japan and overseas, Bravely Default met with strong sales and critical acclaim. Common praise went to the gameplay's mixture of traditional mechanics and new elements, along with its storyline, graphics and music. Main points of criticism were its repetitive late-game stages and elements of its social gameplay and audio. Bravely Default spawned multiple media tie-ins and spin- off games. A sequel, Bravely Second: End Layer, was released in 2015 in Japan and 2016 overseas for the 3DS, while another sequel, titled Bravely Default II, was announced to be released on the Nintendo Switch in 2020. Gameplay Bravely Default is a role-playing game (RPG) which features a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after a certain point in the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle. Outside the main campaign, the game uses networking features powered by the 3DS' StreetPass functionality. A central element is the campaign to reconstruct the village of Norende, destroyed at the beginning of the game. The village is constructed on new ground after obstacles are removed and an area is prepared. The reconstruction incorporates social game elements: friends encountered by the player through StreetPass and online invites become the village's residents, and their efforts are used to create various buildings including houses and shops. The amount of time a project takes to complete depends on the number of friends assigned to it, taking anywhere from days to weeks. Increasing the number of people speeds up the towns' reconstruction. As the reconstruction progresses, the player is awarded with new items and equipment. Individual buildings will gain experience points, granting access to higher-tier rewards, and players have the option of adjusting the types of items rewarded. Special randomly generated optional bosses, known as Nemeses, will appear in the region. Defeating them yields special rewards. =Battle system= Screenshot of a battle in Bravely Default, showing the party fighting an enemy group. The battle is shown on the upper screen, while the party's command menu is shown below. Battles come in two types: random encounters with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Two new options to the battle system are the Brave and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, any party member can Default, which reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes and accumulates BP. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the Nintendo 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice. Tied into the battle system is a Job system: beginning with the Freelancer, the party can gain additional Jobs by obtaining gems called Asterisks from defeated human bosses. Twenty-four Jobs can be found in the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize in healing and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters can be assigned any available Job. In addition to the skills of the equipped Job, the skills of a second Job can be learned, allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies. Friend characters can also be summoned from other players' games: the more a friend summon is used, the more effective their actions become. Descriptions of defeated enemies, along with story recaps and descriptions of locations, are included in an item called D's journal. Within certain conditions, characters can perform Special Moves, customizable powerful moves tied to Jobs: after a Special Move is performed, the entire party is granted buffs for a limited period. This period is represented with a specific tune that plays over normal battle music. Various elements can be added to Special Moves, such as granting elemental properties, launching status ailments at enemies, recovering HP and MP, and temporary status ailment immunity to the party. The customization of Special Moves is directly tied to the creation of specialist shops during the reconstruction of Norende. Experience points acquired at the end of a battle enable characters and their assigned Jobs to level up, unlocking new abilities and boosting character stats such as available HP and MP. Bonuses are gained if the party fulfilled certain conditions. Job abilities and levels can also be borrowed from online friends, in a feature called Abilink. Any Job can be borrowed from available players regardless of their current level. Synopsis Bravely Default is set in the world of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four elemental crystals which are protected and venerated by the global religion known as the Crystal Orthodoxy. One day, the crystals are consumed by darkness and the world is thrown into chaos with numerous calamities. Agn√®s Oblige, Vestal of the Wind Crystal, escapes while the rest of the temple's worshipers perish to protect her. At the same time, a great chasm opens up beneath the village of Norende, killing all of its inhabitants except a young shepherd named Tiz Arrior. When he returns to the chasm hoping to find other survivors, he meets Agn√®s and her fairy companion Airy. The three are then attacked by forces from the hostile Duchy of Eternia, who seek to prevent Agn√®s from awakening the crystals. After defeating the soldiers, Tiz decides to travel with Agn√®s as her protector. They return to Caldisla, where they are also joined by Ringabel, an amnesiac vagabond who holds a book predicting future events, and Edea Lee, an Eternian soldier who becomes disillusioned and defects after her commanding officer commits war crimes. The party travels to the three of the four temples and awaken each of the crystals from darkness, being confronted by the forces of Eternia as they proceed. During their journey, the group is aided by the ancient Sage Yulyana and observed by the immortal Lord DeRosso. The party eventually reaches Eternia, the home of the Earth Crystal, and are forced to defeat the Duchy's leader, Edea's father Braev Lee in battle. A column of light then appears in the Great Chasm once the Earth Crystal is awakened. Airy instructs the others to take her to the Pillar of Light. After the group fend off Edea's close friend Dark Knight Alternis Dim, whose face is identical to Ringabel's, Airy's ritual instead sends them into a parallel world. The process is repeated multiple times; in each of the five worlds the group travel through, they find and awaken the corrupted crystals, Airy performs her ritual in the pillar of light, and they are thrown into a new parallel world. In each world, they find variations on the situations they encountered in their own world, and gradually learn several truths about themselves and their adversaries. Nearly all of the Eternian elite they face were taken in by Braev out of compassion as they were rejected by the Orthodoxy, and Yulyana and DeRosso are revealed to be Braev's allies and key figures in cleansing the Orthodoxy of its corruption. During the group's travels, both Yulyana and DeRosso give subtle warnings to Tiz and Agn√®s about Airy's intentions. Ringabel, revealed to be a version of Alternis Dim who got dragged into the group's Luxendarc, slowly regains his memories of pursuing the party of his world before witnessing them being killed by Airy after she turned into a monster. In truth, Airy has been manipulating the party and uses the crystals to link the worlds to enable her master, the demon Ouroboros, to reach and conquer the Celestial Realm. Depending on the player's actions, two different routes play out. In the normal route, triggered if Agn√®s destroys one of the crystals after figuring out Airy's scheme, Airy attacks them in a fit of rage. The group then pursues her to the Dark Aurora, a realm of darkness near the chasm, and defeat her; her final words claim Ouroboros is still a threat to the world. In the canonical route, should the player awaken the crystals across four different worlds, Airy reveals herself and is defeated by the party. The group goes to Yulyana and DeRosso, who reveal a message left by an \\"angel\\", a version of Agn√®s from another world who was betrayed by Airy; the two have been planning for Ouroboros' arrival, and the group resolves to stop the demon. They travel to the Dark Aurora and defeat Airy, who is then devoured by Ouroboros. After revealing that Tiz is being kept alive by a being from the Celestial Realm, Ouroboros attacks, and DeRosso sacrifices himself to restrain the demon's regeneration. The party are temporarily stopped when Ouroboros begins consuming worlds to regain strength, but alternate versions of them break the links formed by Ouroboros, giving the party a chance to destroy him. Before the path between worlds closes, they return to their own world. In the epilogue, Agn√®s and Edea return to their respective groups to better relations between the reformed Orthodoxy and the Duchy; Ringabel returns to his own world and reclaims his identity as Alternis Dim; Tiz is rendered comatose after going to Caldisla's graveyard and releasing the Celestial Being within him. In a special video teasing the second game, Tiz wakes in a life support tank in Eternia before being rescued from captivity by the mysterious Magnolia Arch. Development According to producer Tomoya Asano, Bravely Default began development as a sequel to Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light (2009), and would have been part of the Final Fantasy franchise. After completing The 4 Heroes of Light, Asano considered what he wanted to do next. Despite having the option to developing something within Square Enix's core franchises, he wanted to do something new, establishing a new brand. During this initial phase, the original development team reached out to Silicon Studio, whose previous work was mostly related to development middleware. Silicon Studio developed a well-received demo for the project and were assigned to develop the game. Despite moving away from the Final Fantasy series, it retained a battle system and world setting in common with many Final Fantasy games. According to Asano, this was both a hangover of the project's original form and a conscious choice to give players from the Final Fantasy series a sense of comfortable familiarity. In later responses to fan questions, Asano confirmed that he designed the Final Fantasy-style story so players would have little trouble entering the world. The story-telling and gameplay was heavily influenced by western video games and television series. Asano described the result as a \\"Japanese RPG with American content thrown in\\". The main challenge for the team was making Bravely Default a traditional RPG without overloading it with nostalgic elements. Despite this, as the team were fans of both Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, nostalgic features were added for genre veterans and be appreciated by newcomers. Asano wanted to bring together what he considered the three core elements of RPGs (battles, growth, and connection) in Bravely Default. An important element was creating a casual experience that anyone could enjoy, even if they had never played an RPG. During development, the team decided to cater for the core Japanese RPG fanbase, as they did not believe the game viable for Western release at the time. At the early stages of development, Bravely Default was going to be an action role-playing game, a genre Silicon Studio had previously worked on with 3D Dot Game Heroes. After developing a prototype build and putting it before Asano, it was decided to make the battle system a traditional turn-based model. The interdependent \\"Brave\\" and \\"Default\\" mechanics underwent changes during the development process. Initially, Asano envisioned a system akin to the Tension stat used in the Dragon Quest series, but designer Kensuke Nakahara wanted something more exciting for players. He was also annoyed that the majority of bosses in both Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy got two or more actions per turn while player characters only got one each. After some consideration, Nakahara decided on a system where characters could bank points by not taking actions during a turn for later use, or create loan points to act multiple times in a current turn. The concept of the Notebook of D, which would offer players deeper insights into the world of Bravely Default, was inspired by a similar system from Higurashi When They Cry. During the late stages of the game's development, the team had to make several last-minute tweaks and changes to ensure the game delivered the best possible performance. Due to the game's chosen mechanics, balancing the game became a major part of later development. The core concept of Bravely Default was defined by Asano as \\"everyone can play\\", as he wanted to bring positive elements from the growing social game market into Bravely Default. The social gameplay was made up of three different elements: the ability to employ StreetPass friends to help reconstruct Norende, the ability to summon friends' characters into battle as a summon, and the \\"Abilink\\" option which allowed players to borrow each other's job levels. The initial versions of these functions were not as elaborate as they would become in the final product. Norende Village was initially displayed on a single screen, but at a suggestion from Asano it was enlarged so players needed to slide the display around. The summoning option was initially going to be a simple display of the summoned character, but it was decided to make the summoning sequence more elaborate. The summoning text initially shared fonts with other elements, but as Asano wanted it to have more impact, a more florid font was used. This styling was influenced by a sequence featuring Japanese idol group AKB48 in an unspecified television drama. The usage of StreetPass was incorporated to differentiate Bravely Default from other RPGs of the time, forming part of Asano's wish to create something new. A notable feature included in the game were augmented reality (AR) movies. The AR movies were developed using a software development kit provided by Nintendo and implemented into the game by Silicon Studio. A unique gimmick included in the game was using the platform's camera to project the player's image into an area of the arena during the final boss battle. The game's music was composed by Revo, the leader of Japanese musical group Sound Horizon. Asano contacted Revo concerning a collaboration as he had listened to his 2004 album Chronicle 2nd. During his work, Revo was able to see the game's ROM, then discuss the game's vision and development goals with Asano. While the initially-agreed track number was between 20 and 30, the number of tracks almost doubled during production as Revo saw situations that needed their own music. Revo aimed for a nostalgic musical style, referencing the music and atmosphere of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and the SaGa series. During recording, tracks were given descriptive working titles, such as \\"Scene of Normal Battle\\" or \\"Song of Asterisk Holder Warfare\\". Multiple battle songs were created for the game, each having a faster tempo depending on the escalating battle situation. Revo's recording sessions were closely linked with the creation of the game's sound source, so the music would fit onto the 3DS' limited storage space without losing too much of its quality. Once the music was recorded, a sound environment was created so that it could be heard clearly through the 3DS system's speakers. While there were concerns about the 3DS cartridge's storage space limitations, these ultimately proved to be minimal. =Scenario and character design= The game's title represented the game's main theme of self-reliance: not blindly following the will of others, and following your own will. \\"Bravely\\" symbolized courage, while \\"Default\\" symbolized denial. The subtitle was one of many proposed by the team, and was chosen by Asano after it helped give an official name to the character Airy: prior to this point, she had gone unnamed and was generally referred to as a \\"Navi character\\". The subtitle was also a coded reference to Airy's true agenda and the game's deliberate removal from the Final Fantasy series. The key words created for the initial draft scenario were \\"large hole\\", referring to the Great Chasm beneath Norende, and \\"parallel world\\", which referred to the many versions of Luxendarc encountered by players during their journey. The greater majority of the main scenario and side quest storylines were fully voiced, with the main cast having a huge amount of dialogue compared to other characters. The summons were themed after classical elements, modern machinery and multiple world mythologies. The game's script was written by Naotaka Hayashi, a staff writer at 5pb. whose most notable work at the time was visual novel Steins;Gate. After playing through Steins;Gate on the recommendation of another staff member, Asano decided that Hayashi would be able to create the appealing characters and surprising scenario needed for the story, and asked 5pb. if Hayashi could work on Bravely Default. Another reason Asano wanted Hayashi was due to the plot's heavy use of parallel worlds. Hayashi's work on the game involved creating the plot and character settings. While he wrote the majority of the game's dialogue, more detailed work was given to writers at Square Enix and Silicon Studio. One of the supplementary writers was Silicon Studio's Keiichi Ajiro, who wrote the contents of D's Notebook. Ajiro also created the initial story outline with Asano. The initial story concept was kept deliberately simple, but its complexity increased during the writing process. During his work, Hayashi was given guidelines by Square Enix about the characters and story: for instance, Asano wanted the heroes and villains to be equally compelling, along with raising the game's targeted age group. Something that Hayashi needed to remember during the writing process was the need to limit the length of dialogue segments. While visual novels had a high leeway for dialogue quantity, Asano would make requests such as a sentence being within a 22-character limit, and to not overrun into multiple dialogue boxes. The main character designer and art director was Akihiko Yoshida, whose previous notable work included Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. In contrast to much of his previous artwork, Yoshida created the game's artwork using a stronger design and coloring style. His artwork for Agn√®s was designed to represent her solitude and knowledge of her fate while also displaying cuteness and motherliness. Tiz's design was designed not to convey a strong personality, as he in part represented the player. For the game's environmental artwork, Yoshida drew on European children's literature. The in-game environments such as towns and the overworld were created using specially-drawn art mapped to a pseudo-3D layout. This style was meant to emulate classic picture books. Finalization of the art style took a long period, going through extensive trial and error. Designs for many of the secondary characters were handled by other artists: Atsushi ≈åkubo, who had most notably worked on the Soul Eater manga series, designed Einheria and the Valkyrie job outfits. Erutus Profiteur and the Merchant job designed by Hideki Ishikawa, whose work included character designs for Lord of Vermilion arcade game series. Kamiizumi and the Swordmaster job were designed by Dorin Makoto, who had most notably worked on the Sengoku Basara series. Red Mage Flore DeRossa and the Red Mage job was designed by Take, who worked on the Katanagatari light novel series. Qada and the Salve Maker job were designed by Midori Foo, an artist who had worked on multiple light novels and online games. Release Bravely Default was first announced in September 2011 under its original Japanese title as part of Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the 3DS, alongside titles such as Monster Hunter 4 and Fire Emblem Awakening. Between February and September 2012, five different demos were released through Nintendo eShop. The first demo featured Agn√®s and demonstrated character control. The second, released in March, featured the character Tiz and town exploration. The third demo, released in June, showcased the battle system and introduced Edea. The fourth demo, released in August, featured the character Ringabel and demonstrated the job and character customization systems. The fifth and final demo, released in September, included features from all the previous demos and included elements such as Friend Summons, and the Abilink and Norende reconstruction social elements. With the release of the fifth demo, the sale of the other demos was discontinued. The demos were developed alongside the main game as stand-alone experiences taken from several points within the game. They also ended up providing the team with feedback for gameplay adjustments. Each demo included an AR movie featuring one of the main cast. Bravely Default released on October 11, 2012. It was published by Square Enix. Along with the standard edition, Square Enix created a collector's edition for exclusive sale through their online store. The collector's edition featured an AR poster, a first print copy of the game's soundtrack, an art book, and a themed 3DS protective case. Downloadable content in the form of additional character costumes were made available both through promotional codes and post-release content. An updated edition of the game, titled Bravely Default: For the Sequel, was announced in August 2013 in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump for a release on December 5 that year. For the Sequel was stated to have over a hundred different improvements and adjustments: these included additional save slots, additional difficulty levels, auto saving options, the addition of new subevent scenes, new gameplay elements such as the \\"Bravely Second\\" ability, and subtitles in multiple languages. Many of these alterations were based on questionnaires sent out by the company after the original version's release. According to staff, For the Sequel was intended as a \\"trial version\\" for its sequel, already in development after the success of Bravely Default. =Localization= Prior to any official announcement of its western release, Bravely Default was cited by multiple journalists as a game that should be localized for western markets. In October 2012, Asano stated that there were no plans to localize the game, but that fans should continue inquiring so that their wishes were made clear. A localization was officially announced in April 2013. Nintendo took charge of publishing duties overseas. The western version was based on the For the Sequel expanded version. It released in Europe on December 6, 2013. An earlier false report in Nintendo's financial report indicated that its European release would be in 2014, but this was later corrected by Nintendo of Europe. In Australia, it released on December 7. In North America, it released on February 7, 2014. Both in North America and the UK, a collector's edition was created including the soundtrack, an artbook, and over thirty AR cards. The UK edition also included a figurine of Agn√®s. It was also released in South Korea on April 16, although it was not localized into Korean, placing it in contrast with other Nintendo releases such as Shin Megami Tensei IV. The localization itself was handled by Bill Black and his company Binari Sonori, whose previous work included Demons' Score for Square Enix and World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade for Blizzard Entertainment. Another key staff member was Timothy Law, a localization editor from Square Enix who supervised the translation and voice recording for the title. An element of the localization that provided a challenge was creating a sense of wordplay equivalent with that used in the original Japanese. An example of this was the Performer job and its owner, the latter of which needed to have her first name adjusted while taking into consideration European gender perceptions. Another example from the dialogue was the need to create jokes that would not work in Japanese, such as Agn√®s commenting on finding a \\"lucky charm\\". The subtitle \\"Flying Fairy\\" was removed for the western release as it might have given a false impression of family-friendly content due to different cultural perceptions to Japan. The English voice actors were chosen to sound as similar as possible to their Japanese counterparts, and adjustments were made to characters through the actors' performances: these included making Ringabel more flirtatious, and adjusting Edea's growl of rage between language versions. The game uses both the English and Japanese dubs, along with subtitles in multiple languages. The Western localization of the game contains censorship related to some sexually suggestive material in the original game: the ages of the main characters were increased to no longer be underage by Western standards, with 15-year-olds being changed to be 18-year- olds, and two of the female playable characters' costumes were altered to make them less revealing. Reception The story was met with positive reviews. Famitsu was highly positive about the story, although the reviewers did not go into specifics. Edge Magazine called the narrative \\"rich and detailed\\", enjoying the twists put on the present genre tropes and the darker narrative elements despite the experience being undermined by the writing quality. Andrew Fitch of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the story and characters enjoyable, and in some cases \\"stellar\\", while Ben Moore of GameTrailers noted the story's aversion to take risks despite interesting twists, and found that it was bogged down by advanced foreshadowing of major plot twists. Game Informers Jeff Marchiafava found the game's story and characters to be \\"rife with clich√©s\\", and called the dialogue \\"excessively wordy\\" despite the late- game developments improving on both aspects. Simon Parkin, writing for Eurogamer, found the story less \\"unusual\\" than other aspects, but praised its willingness to send itself up and enjoyed Hayashi's subtle subversion of genre tropes. GameSpot's John Robertson was fairly negative, saying that it started out poorly and never managed to throw off that initial impression. David Evans of IGN praised the characters for their strength, but found that the story's pacing struggled at times. Danielle Riendeau of Polygon, despite finding many characters appealing, called the story \\"more like a pastiche of tropes than its own unique take [on the genre]\\". Chandra Nair of Official Nintendo Magazine called story and character development \\"extremely impressive\\", while Bradly Halestorm of Hardcore Gamer found the story to be solid and the main cast enjoyable. Alex Fuller of RPGamer found the main cast quite enjoyable, praising their Party Chat interactions, and enjoyed the story despite its initial overly straightforward premise. The gameplay was praised overall. The Edge reviewer greatly enjoyed the deceptively simple Bravely and Default mechanics despite a run time they described as \\"bloated\\". Fitch likewise enjoyed the gameplay mechanics, but found the social elements to be less successful despite not actively irritating him. Moore praised the battle system and implementation of the Job system, although the latter necessitated grinding to unlock its full value. He also praised the ability to adjust encounter rates and battle speed, and positively noted the social features as engaging secondary activities. Marchiafava found that the battle and Job systems held up throughout the entire game, and like Moore found the social systems enjoyable. Nair was positive about the depth and strategy the gameplay opened up, despite criticizing the number of options increasing the amount of time spent in battle. Both Evans and Robertson praised the battle system and general gameplay, with Robertson calling the former innovative within the genre. Riendeau found that the battle system's depth and quality gave her feelings of elation when she successfully killed opponents, but also saw the need to grind for experience emerging during the later stages of the game negatively impacted the experience. Parkin referred to the Brave and Default mechanics as the game's \\"central - and brilliant - conceit\\". Fuller, while finding the microtransactions a \\"waste of money\\", he greatly enjoyed the battle mechanics and multiple user-friendly features. Halestorm shared the positive opinions of other reviewers on the battle system, alongside praising the game's amount and quality of content. Many reviewers positively compared the gameplay and style to earlier Final Fantasy games. Multiple western reviewers commented negatively on the repetitive late-game section. The graphics and presentation garnered mixed opinions. Famitsu praised the game's graphics, while Edge admired the art style and monster design, and was glad that the hardware limitations faced by The 4 Heroes of Light were not present in Bravely Default. Marchiafava called the graphics \\"beautiful\\" and praised the soundtrack, though called the English voice acting \\"hit or miss\\". Fuller was less impressed by the visuals, but found the music to be excellent . Halestorm, while he did not think the graphics were the best to be found on the 3DS, praised their stylized appearance and the well-executed 3D effect, and called the soundtrack \\"downright hypnotizing\\". Nair praised the game's audio despite little variety in the musical score, and called its visuals \\"gorgeous\\". Evens praised the character art for its \\"simple and striking\\" appearance, and its stylized background artwork. Riendeau commented that the game's aesthetic kept her invested when the story failed to do so. Parkin referred to the background artwork as \\"like nothing else\\". Robertson referred to the game's art style as \\"striking and engaging\\". =Sales= In its debut week, Bravely Default topped gaming charts with sales of 141,529 units, noted as being an impressive debut for a new game. It had a sell-through rate of over 85%. Its sales and sell-through rate were notably higher than those of its predecessor The 4 Heroes of Light. By late January 2013, shipments and eventually sales of the game reached 300,000 copies in Japan. For the Sequel debuted at #8 in gaming charts, selling 35,617 units. By 2014, For the Sequel had sold 59,300 units, making it the 160th best-selling game of that year. In North America, Bravely Default met with strong debut sales, reaching #10 in NPD Group's sales charts and selling 200,000 copies. In July 2014, it was reported that Bravely Default had sold one million copies worldwide: 400,000 units were sold in Japan, while 600,000 were sold overseas. =Accolades= Famitsu awarded the game its \\"Rookie Award\\" at its 2012 Awards event, while it received the 2012 Dengeki Online Consumer Award, the latter award being given while beating Persona 4 Golden (2nd) and Rune Factory 4 (3rd). At the Japan Game Awards, it received the Future Game Award in 2012 and the Excellence Award in 2013. It later won GameSpot's 3DS Game of the Year 2014 award. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards Bravely Default was nominated for the Game, Original Role Playing category. It was ranked by both IGN and GameSpot as one of the best games on the 3DS in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Legacy The game's success, which went against what Square Enix assumed would happen due to the title's identity as a traditional role-playing game, prompted them to reconsider their strategy for game making, which up to that point had been geared towards developing titles tailored for western markets rather than focusing on the Japanese market. According to the developers, none of them believed that the game would be released overseas, and were overwhelmed by the positive fan feedback they had received. A manga titled Bravely Default: Flying Fairy began serialization online through Famitsu. Two compilation volumes were released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two supplementary books, released under the title Bravely Default: The Pocketbook of R, were released in December 2013. In addition to this, two drama CDs containing supplementary stories were released through 2013 and 2014. Music from the game was featured Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as DLC. A browser game spin-off titled Bravely Default: Praying Brage, began an open beta on November 11, 2012. Developed by NHN Hangame, Praying Brage takes place 200 years after the original game, and includes a new cast of characters aligned to four forces themed after Luxendarc's elemental crystals. Another spin-off, Bravely Archive: D's Report, was released for mobile devices on January 22, 2015. Like Praying Brage, it was set far in the future, followed an alternate scenario stemming from the events of Bravely Default, and featured characters from Praying Brage. By August of that year, D's Report had reached over four million downloads. A sequel was confirmed as being in development as early as 2013. The new game, Bravely Second: End Layer, was officially announced in December 2013. It released in Japan in 2015 and overseas in 2016. In an interview with Japanese magazine Dengeki, Asano said that he would ideally like to release a new Bravely game every year. Following the second game's release, Asano would partner with Square Enix producer Masashi Takahashi and the studio Acquire to develop a new traditional role- playing game that reconsidered their expectations after witnessing the reception to the Bravely series. This game, which would become Octopath Traveler, was announced in January 2017 and released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch in July 2018, with a PC release to follow in June 2019. A third entry in the Bravely series, Bravely Default II, was announced at The Game Awards 2019 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch. Two years prior on Christmas Day 2017, character designer Akihiko Yoshida posted an image on Twitter of Edea holding a pair of Joy-Con controllers. Additionally after Octopath Traveler sold over 1 million copies, the occasion was celebrated with another illustration on Twitter, with the pose assumed by the eight party members strongly resembling Airy from the first game.https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v;=hqXJb24h2H8 Similar to how numbered sequels function in the Final Fantasy franchise, this new installment takes place in a new world separate from the previous games with a brand new cast of characters. It will once again be produced by Team Asano and composed by Revo, with the core gameplay now being handled by Claytechworks instead of Silicon Studio. The game is currently scheduled for a worldwide release in 2020. A free demo was made available on the Nintendo eShop on March 26, 2020, with a survey planned to gather feedback from players and tweak the game accordingly.

Initially, early human farmers selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics and used these as a seed source for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of characteristics over time. In time however, experiments began with deliberate hybridization, the science and understanding of which was greatly enhanced by the work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel's work ultimately led to the new science of genetics. Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering molecular biology, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and statistics (biometrics). It has also developed its own technology. Plant breeding efforts are divided into a number of different historical landmarks. Early plant breeding =Domestication= This map shows the sites of domestication for a number of crops. Places where crops were initially domesticated are called centers of origin Domestication of plants is an artificial selection process conducted by humans to produce plants that have more desirable traits than wild plants, and which renders them dependent on artificial usually enhanced environments for their continued existence. The practice is estimated to date back 9,000-11,000 years. Many crops in present-day cultivation are the result of domestication in ancient times, about 5,000 years ago in the Old World and 3,000 years ago in the New World. In the Neolithic period, domestication took a minimum of 1,000 years and a maximum of 7,000 years. Today, all principal food crops come from domesticated varieties. Almost all the domesticated plants used today for food and agriculture were domesticated in the centers of origin. In these centers there is still a great diversity of closely related wild plants, so- called crop wild relatives, that can also be used for improving modern cultivars by plant breeding. A plant whose origin or selection is due primarily to intentional human activity is called a cultigen, and a cultivated crop species that has evolved from wild populations due to selective pressures from traditional farmers is called a landrace. Landraces, which can be the result of natural forces or domestication, are plants or animals that are ideally suited to a particular region or environment. An example are the landraces of rice, Oryza sativa subspecies indica, which was developed in South Asia, and Oryza sativa subspecies japonica, which was developed in China. For more on the mechanisms of domestication, see Hybrid (biology). =Columbian Exchange= Humans have traded useful plants from distant lands for centuries, and plant hunters have been sent to bring plants back for cultivation. Human agriculture has had two important results: the plants most favoured by humans came to be grown in many places and (2) gardens and farms have provided some opportunities for plants to interbreed that would not have been possible for their wild ancestors. Columbus's arrival in America in 1492 triggered unprecedented transfer of plant resources between Europe and the New World. Scientific plant breeding Garton's catalogue from 1902 Gregor Mendel's experiments with plant hybridization led to his laws of inheritance. This work became well known in the 1900s and formed the basis of the new science of genetics, which stimulated research by many plant scientists dedicated to improving crop production through plant breeding. However, successful commercial plant breeding concerns began to be founded from the late 19th century. Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to cross- pollinate agricultural plants and commercialize the newly created varieties. He began experimenting with the artificial cross pollination firstly of cereal plants, then herbage species and root crops and developed far reaching techniques in plant breeding.Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950 William Farrer revolutionized wheat farming in Australia with the widespread release in 1903 of the fungus resistant \\"Federation\\" strain of wheat, which was developed as a result of his plant breeding work over a period of twenty years using Mendel's theories.William Farrer From 1904 to World War II in Italy, Nazareno Strampelli created a number of wheat hybrids. His work allowed Italy to increase crop production during the so-called \\"Battle for Grain\\" (1925‚Äì1940) and some varieties were exported to foreign countries, such as Argentina, Mexico, and China. Strampelli's work laid the foundations for Norman Borlaug and the Green Revolution. =Green revolution= In 1908, George Harrison Shull described heterosis, also known as hybrid vigor. Heterosis describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. Maize was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids. By the 1920s, statistical methods were developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), developed in maize, was described by Marcus Morton Rhoades. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile pollen. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive detasseling. These early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the United States in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after World War II, the Green Revolution increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s. This remarkable improvement was based on three essential crops. First came the development of hybrid maize, then high-yielding and input-responsive \\"semi-dwarf wheat\\" (for which the CIMMYT breeder N.E. Borlaug received the Nobel prize for peace in 1970), and third came high-yielding \\"short statured rice\\" cultivars. Similarly notable improvements were achieved in other crops like sorghum and alfalfa. =Molecular genetics and bio- revolution= Intensive research in molecular genetics has led to the development of recombinant DNA technology (popularly called genetic engineering). Advancement in biotechnological techniques has opened many possibilities for breeding crops. Thus, while mendelian genetics allowed plant breeders to perform genetic transformations in a few crops, molecular genetics has provided the key to both the manipulation of the internal genetic structure, and the \\"crafting\\" of new cultivars according to a pre-determined plan.

College Sessoms, a native of Portsmouth, Virginia, played for the Monarchs in nearby Norfolk. He scored 1,985 points (the fourth most in school history at the time), grabbed 779 rebounds and shot 81.9% from the free throw line. In each of his four seasons, Old Dominion qualified for postseason tournaments. These included the 1992 and 1995 NCAA Tournaments as well as the 1993 and 1994 National Invitation Tournaments. Sessoms and teammate Odell Hodge, who was a two-time CAA Player of the Year himself, guided Old Dominion to three straight regular season conference championships (1993‚Äì95) as well as two CAA Men's Basketball Tournament championships (1992 and 1995).

Its purpose is to exchange printed circuit board design information between design and manufacturing and between design tools from different EDA/ECAD vendors. It was originally developed by Valor Computerized Systems, Ltd. (acquired in 2010 by Mentor Graphics) as the job description format for their CAM system. ODB stands for open database, but its openness is disputed,IPC-2581 Panel: A Spirited Discussion on PCB Data Transfer Formats, Richard Goering, Cadence Design Systems blog, October 2, 2011 on the panel session \\"Data Transfer in the 21st Century,\\" PCB West conference, Santa Clara, California, September 29, 2011 as discussed below. The '++' suffix, evocative of C++, was added in 1997 with the addition of component descriptions. There are two versions of ODB++: the original (now controlled by Mentor) and an XML version called ODB++(X) that Valor developed and donated to the IPC organization in an attempt to merge GenCAM (IPC-2511) and ODB++ into Offspring (IPC-2581). Introduction Inside almost every electronic device is a PCB onto which the semiconductor and other components are mechanically and electrically connected by soldering. These PCBs are designed using a computer-aided design (CAD) system. To physically realize the design, the computerized design information must be transferred to a photolithographic computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system. Since the CAD and CAM systems are generally produced by different companies, they have to agree on a CAD-to-CAM data exchange format to transfer the data. ODB++ is one such file format for performing this transfer. Other formats are compared and contrasted below. After the bare board is manufactured, the electronic components are placed and soldered, for example by SMT placement equipment and wave or reflow soldering. File structure When in use, ODB++ data is stored in a hierarchy of files and file folders. However, for transmission it is convenient to use common operating system commands that create a single, compressed file that preserves the hierarchy information. For example, on Unix and commands can be used. In ODB++(X), the database is contained in a single XML file by default. ODB++ covers the specification of not only conductor layer artwork and drill data, but also material stack up, netlist with test points, component bill of materials, component placement, fabrication data, and dimension data. History Valor was founded in 1992 and it released ODB in 1995. It added the ++ suffix when component names were added in 1997. The XML version was developed beginning 2000, and ended in 2008 with the donation to IPC. Valor was acquired by Mentor in 2010. Adoption In the late 1990s it became clear to industry participants that a second- generation data transfer format would be more efficient than prevalent Gerber format, which was a first generation format at that time. However, it was very difficult to reach a consensus over which of two candidates should be selected: # ODB++: proven but proprietary # IPC-2511 GenCAM: not widely used but open In 2002, a compromise format, ODB++(X), was recommended by National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI; an industry body, subsequently renamed International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative, iNEMI) after a two-year mediation effort between the GenCAM and ODB++ camps. Companies that supported the recommendation at the time included Cadence, Hewlett-Packard, Lucent, Easylogix, Mentor (which acquired Valor some eight years later), Nokia and Xerox. But in fact adoption to date has been minimal. As a result, and as detailed below, the industry is still divided. Late 2014 Gerber X2 was introduced which added attributes (\\"intelligence\\") to the Gerber format in a compatible way, converting Gerber to a second generation format. =Advocacy= Lists of EDA tools that support import and/or export of ODB++ have been compiled by Artwork Conversion Software, Mentor itself, and on the Comparison of EDA packages table. Some companies that have adopted the ODB++ format are advocates for its use. Streamline Circuits reports that ODB++ provides much greater efficiency than the competing Gerber format, stating that \\"an 8-layer printed circuit board can take up to 5 hours to plan and tool using Gerber and only 1 hour when using ODB++.\\" According to Streamline, manufacturers are adopting it to overcome the limitations of the simpler Gerber format. DownStream Technologies calls ODB++ \\"the defacto standard for intelligent data exchange in EDA\\" In 2002, Dana Korf of Sanmina/SCI called ODB++ \\"the prevalent non-Gerber format.\\" Kent Balius of Viasystems, states of ODB++ \\"...really we don‚Äôt need anything else.\\" =Opposition= Lack of need Ucamco, the developers of the Gerber format, argue that the prevalent Gerber-based flow (with some additions) is as complete and efficient as ODB++. These additions were introduced in Gerber X2, which added attributes to classical Extended Gerber. Standard attributes allow to define the layer structure, pad functions and CAD netlist. Concerns ODB++ is a proprietary format controlled by Valor and now Mentor, and so, like all proprietary standards, it comes with the risk of vendor lock-in. CAD companies had some concerns about this when ODB++ was controlled by Valor, a CAM company, but these concerns were magnified when a rival CAD company, Mentor, acquired Valor. Although Mentor claims that it \\"...openly supports inclusion of ODB++ and updates for other EDA tool vendors,\\" it used to restrict access to the specification and required a non-disclosure agreement. The application form used to include a requirement to: \\"...Demonstrate a customer need for this integration through references from mutual customers. Provide a recommendation from a Mentor Graphics product division or demonstrate the incremental value of this integration to both Mentor Graphics and the partner company.\\" Some direct competitors inferred this meant restricted access. This was a source of frustration not only for competitors but also for the Mentor user community. In 2012, Julian Coates, director of business development at Mentor's Valor division claimed that, so far, all ODB++ partners, including competitors to Mentor, who have applied for assistance to build and maintain ODB++ interfaces via the ODB++ Solutions Alliance have been accepted without reservation or cost. In addition, the format specification is now openly available via the ODB++ Solutions Alliance without the need for NDA. Membership of the ODB++ Solutions Alliance is free of charge and open to anybody who registers. A no-charge ODB++ Viewer and other software utilities are available to registrants.http://www.odb-sa.com/resources/ Potential resolution Critics of the proprietary nature of ODB++ point to several more open formats as models for a future consensus format: * Gerber Format: Although nominally proprietary to Ucamco, its specification has always been open and freely downloadable making it de facto an open standard. The introduction of attributes with Gerber X2 in late 2014 added \\"intelligence\\" to the format (layer structure, pad functions and CAD netlist). * IPC-2511 (\\"GenCAM\\") which resulted from a donation of certain technologies by Teradyne/GenRAD to IPC. * IPC-2581 (\\"Offspring\\") an attempt to merge GenCAM with ODB++(X). In 2011, an industry consortium was created to support it, motivated in part by frustration with the proprietary nature of ODB++. Cadence Design Systems, Zuken, Artwork Conversion Software and the owners of Gerber format, Ucamco, joined it,Users Updating, Adopting IPC Data Transfer Spec, Printed Circuit Design and Fab magazine, Mike Buetow, 24 June 2011 but, initially, not Mentor. However, in 2012, Mentor did join. This, combined with the 2012 announcement by Zuken that it would join the ODB++ Solutions Alliance, creates the possibility that PCB designers will have a choice of format no matter which EDA tool they choose. * OpenAccess, which resulted from a transfer of certain technologies by Cadence to the Si2 organization. Although it was originally designed for integrated circuits, it is now finding application for IC package and PCB design also. * JPCA-EB02 (\\"Fujiko\\") based on work by Prof. Tomokage of Fukuoka University. * EDIF - Electronic Design Interchange Format References External links * ODB++ Solutions Alliance, domain registered by Mentor Graphics Category:Computer file formats Category:EDA file formats Category:Printed circuit board manufacturing Category:Graphics file formats ","title":"ODB++"},{"id":"33132286","text":"Private Asset Management (also known as PAM) is a magazine for the wealth management and family office industry.

Early career Knemeyer attended the Technische Hochschule Berlin, from which he graduated in 1933 with a dual major of theoretical experimental physics and aeronautical engineering. He was affiliated with the Academic Flying Group. In 1935 Knemeyer was a flight instructor for the Reich Air Ministry, a civilian organisation at the disposal of the German military. By 1936 Knemeyer's invention of the Dreieckrechner hand-held flight computing device, similar to American Lt. Philip Dalton's contemporaneous E6B invention, was starting to become commonplace in both military Luftwaffe aviation and German civil pilots' use. He enlisted in the Luftwaffe after the outbreak of World War II, on 4 September 1939.Herwig & Rode 1998, p. 14. World War II After serving as Field Marshal Walter von Brauchitsch's pilot during the brief Invasion of Poland, Knemeyer was assigned to the Rowehl Reconnaissance Group. During his time with this group Knemeyer flew hundreds of reconnaissance flights in every theatre of the German war.Kahn 1978, p. 115. In autumn 1939, Knemeyer flew a reconnaissance mission to Narvik, Norway to observe whether the British had occupied Narvik seaport. While on this mission Knemeyer took photographs of the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow and outmanoeuvred two Spitfires to escape with the photographs. Based on this intelligence of the Kriegsmarine sank the British battleship in a famous incident. For this, Knemeyer was awarded his first Iron Cross. In April 1943, Knemeyer was appointed the technical officer of General Dietrich Peltz, who was responsible for the air war against England. In this capacity he established a program focused on capturing and re-fitting enemy aircraft, as a means to gain a tactical advantage and assist the Luftwaffe's internal research efforts.Smith, Creek & Petrick 2003, p. 70. In 1943, alarmed that Allied advances in aviation technology threatened to tip the balance of the war against Germany, Hermann G√∂ring convened a conference at Carinhall among his senior leadership. Peltz brought Knemeyer with him to this conference, and G√∂ring was enamored with Knemeyer's innovative ideas. After the conference G√∂ring declared \\"Knemeyer is my boy!\\" and in July 1943 reassigned him to be his personal technical advisor. Several months later Knemeyer was promoted to Oberst and made Director of Research and Development of the Luftwaffe. G√∂ring came to call Knemeyer the \\"Star Gazer\\"Baumbach 1949, p. 199. and would greet him with the question, \\"Now, my Star Gazer, what do you see in your crystal ball?\\"Knemeyer 1985, p. 23. In November 1943, Knemeyer was appointed Head of Technical Development for the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM), under Oberst Edgar Petersen's command. By February 1944, Knemeyer had surprisingly never flown a German heavy bomber of any sort, until he got his turn to fly one of the Heinkel He 177B prototypes on 24 February at the Wiener Neustadt military airfield. His favourable opinion on the twin tail-equipped He 177 V102 aircraft's \\"excellent handling qualities\\" compelled him to recommend that the Heinkel firm place the He 177B design's priority above that of the Heinkel He 343 four-jet medium bomber design, which was still in its early stages. Shortly after rising to his top-level technical appointment within the RLM, Knemeyer became close with old colleague, General Werner Baumbach.Baumbach 1949, pp. 198‚Äì199.Smith & Kay 1972. Knemeyer was included on a Special Committee of top-ranking Luftwaffe administrators in November 1943 for the purpose of advocating broad adoption of and investment in the Me-262.Green 1970, pp. 622‚Äì623. Aviation book authors J. Richard Smith and Eddie Creek credit Knemeyer and General Adolf Galland as the men responsible for Germany's finally putting the Me 262A-1a jet fighter into mass production.Smith & Creek 1982, p. 89. In 1944, the German hierarchy placed a renewed call for creative plans to reverse the now-inevitable defeat descending on Nazi Germany. Familiar with the newest technologies, Knemeyer conceived a plan to develop a long-range bomber that would drop a radioactive \\"dirty bomb\\" on New York City, in hopes of intimidating the United States out of the war. This idea was embraced and Knemeyer set up and personally supervised a competition between the three most promising technologies: Wernher von Braun's Aggregat A-9 rocket missile and A-10 booster rocket; Eugen S√§nger's Silbervogel, and the Horten brothers' Horten Ho 229 turbojet-powered flying wing fighter. While this competition accelerated the progress of leading edge aviation technology, of these specified aerospace design projects, only one prototype example of the Ho 229 (the Versuchs-Zwei, or Ho 229 V2 second prototype) flew prior to the end of the war.Shepelev & Ottens 2006, p. 70. Operation Paperclip Knemeyer was arrested in the British Zone of Occupation and was interned in M√ºnster and then at the Latimer prison camp. Knemeyer was part of the Operation Paperclip and in June 1948 he was awarded a permanent contract of employment with the United States Air Force, Air Material Command. His family was then able to join him in America. Knemeyer began with the United States War Department on 1 July 1947. As acknowledgement of his contributions, in 1966 he received the highest civilian award granted by the U.S. military, the U.S. Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award.

These craft are intended to deliver troops and equipment onshore from amphibious assault ships during amphibious assaults. The craft are operated by the Spanish Navy and the Royal Australian Navy (the latter referring to the vessels as LHD Landing Craft or LLC), and have been ordered by the Turkish Navy. Project history and design In 1999, a contract for the construction of two prototypes landing craft (L-601 and L-602), for evaluation and testing in different conditions was signed. These craft would replace the LCM-8s in Spanish Navy service. After undergoing trials, 12 additional units were ordered to service the two Galicia-class landing platform dock ships (Galicia and Castilla) and the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. The landing craft have the ability to operate over-the-horizon, as they are equipped with radar navigation, GPS, gyro needle/magnetic compasses and HF communications equipment, VHF and UHF. This allows them to operate up to from their mothership. Propulsion is supplied by two MAN D-2842 LE 402X diesel engines, which supply each to the two waterjets, allowing the craft to reach unladen, and loaded. Maximum range at economical speeds is . The LCM-1E incorporates a stern gate, allowing the loading and unloading of vehicles onto all landing craft within the dry stern dock, without having to open the gate to swap landing craft around. In turn, this saves having to dock down the landing platform, and allows re-stowing of vehicles while the landing platform is underway. There is a maximum limit of 12 tons for the transfer of vehicles in this configuration. Service Two Spanish Navy LCM-1E heading for the beach =Spanish Navy= The Spanish LCM-1Es are assigned to the Naval Beach Group, based at Naval Station Props. Since joining the Spanish Navy, four of the 12 units built in the shipyards of San Fernando and Puerto Real have been involved in a mission in Lebanon, where they have been used for beach landing marines. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, four LCM-1E were used to land relief personnel and first aid material directly on the beach, avoiding the partially destroyed and highly congested harbours. Foreign orders Two Royal Australian Navy LCCs at In 2009, the Australian Defence Force began plans to acquire landing craft for the under-construction Canberra-class landing helicopter dock ships. Arrangements were made to acquire craft from Navantia (the builder responsible for the LHDs), and in September 2011, the purchase of 12 LCM-1E craft was approved by the Australian government. The landing craft were delivered in batches of four: the first batch in May 2014, followed by the second in February 2015, with the third due by mid-2015. In Australian service, the craft are referred to as LLCs (LHD Landing Craft), and six are assigned to each of the Canberra-class ships: four embarked, two assigned to shore facilities for training and trials, and rotated aboard as embarked craft require maintenance. On 29 December 2013, the Turkish Navy selected Navantia to work with local partner Sedef to build a ship based on Juan Carlos I References Category:Landing craft ","title":"LCM-1E"},{"id":"33132428","text":"Financial Advisor is a monthly financial services magazine which delivers market information for financial advisors.

Only a single specimen is known; a holotype queen found preserved as a compression fossil. The specimen had no wings and small portions of its legs and eyes were faintly preserved. It was a large ant, reaching in length. This ants' behaviour would have been similar to that of extant Myrmeciinae ants, such as foraging singly in search for arthropod prey and nesting in soil or in trees. Macabeemyrma shows similarities to extinct ants in the genus Ypresiomyrma, and to the living Nothomyrmecia macrops, but has not been conclusively assigned to any tribe, instead generally regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae. However, the sole specimen lacks definitive traits, and its classification in Myrmeciinae, and even its identity as an ant, has been challenged. History and classification Type locality of Macabeemyrma Macabeemyrma ovata is known only from a single fossil specimen: a mostly complete adult queen, preserved as a compression fossil in fine-grained shale. The shale is from fossiliferous outcrops at the McAbee Fossil Beds, part of an unnamed formation in the Kamloops group which outcrops east of Cache Creek in British Columbia, Canada. The holotype specimen was collected by an unknown person and donated to Thompson Rivers University in 2002. The specimen was described by Bruce Archibald, Stefan Cover and Corrie Moreau of Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, with their 2006 type description of the genus and species. The generic name Macabeemyrma is a toponym of the type locality at McAbee combined with the Greek ', meaning \\"ant\\". The specific epithet ovata, from the Latin \\"ovatus\\" meaning \\"egg shaped\\", refers to the shape of the head capsule. Archibald and colleagues originally classified Macabeemyrma as incertae sedis (Latin for \\"of uncertain placement\\") within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as it could not be confidently placed into any ant tribe. However, in a 2008 paper, Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, noted that the specimen shares some traits found in other ant subfamilies and some wasps, and lacks key diagnostic traits (synapomorphies) of the ant family, Formicidae, and thus argued Macabeemyrma could only be confidently classified as incertae sedis within the order Hymenoptera. A subsequent report describing new fossil myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald and colleagues without comment on the views of Baroni Urbani. The following cladograms generated by Archibald and colleagues show two possible phylogenetic positions of Macabeemyrma among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae; the cladogram on the right included three additional extinct genera compared to that on the left. They suggest that Macabeemyrma ovata and other extinct ants such as Avitomyrmex and Ypresiomyrma may be closely related to the living Nothomyrmecia macrops. { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"   align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\" } Description The overall body of the ant is poorly preserved and much of it is indistinct. Macabeemyrma ovata is about long with a distinct elongated oval head capsule that is about 1.5x longer than wide. The holotype is missing the wings and some portions of the legs while the eyes are very faintly preserved. It could not be confirmed whether its eyes were compound or not, but if it was to be confirmed they would share similar eye characteristics to Myrmecia. The exact shape of the mandibles cannot be properly determined, but they are elongated and not subtriangular which is normal for other members of Myrmeciinae except the genus Myrmecia. Its elongated head and mandibles distinguish this species from those in the genus Ypresiomyrma, which are otherwise thought to have a close phylogenetic relationship due to similarities. The waist consists of a single segment, and whether or not the ant has a sting cannot be fully determined due to the condition of the specimen collected. Ecology Archibald and colleagues suggested the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata may have been similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes that were used to hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.

People who confabulate present incorrect memories ranging from \\"subtle alterations to bizarre fabrications\\", and are generally very confident about their recollections, despite contradictory evidence.  Description  Confabulation is distinguished from lying as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false.Moscovitch M. 1995. \\"Confabulation\\". In (Eds. Schacter D.L., Coyle J.T., Fischbach G.D., Mesulum M.M. & Sullivan L.G.), Memory Distortion. pp. 226‚Äì51. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal. Most known cases of confabulation are symptomatic of brain damage or dementias, such as aneurysm, Alzheimer's disease, or Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome (a common manifestation of thiamine deficiency caused by alcoholism). Additionally confabulation often occurs in people who are suffering from anticholinergic toxidrome when interrogated about bizarre or irrational behaviour. Confabulated memories of all types most often occur in autobiographical memory and are indicative of a complicated and intricate process that can be led astray at any point during encoding, storage, or recall of a memory. This type of confabulation is commonly seen in Korsakoff's syndrome. = Distinctions = Two types of confabulation are often distinguished: * Provoked (momentary, or secondary) confabulations represent a normal response to a faulty memory, are common in both amnesia and dementia, and can become apparent during memory tests. * Spontaneous (or primary) confabulations do not occur in response to a cue and seem to be involuntary. They are relatively rare, more common in cases of dementia, and may result from the interaction between frontal lobe pathology and organic amnesia. Another distinction is that between: * Verbal confabulations- spoken false memories, most common type * Behavioral confabulations- occur when an individual acts on their false memories  Signs and symptoms  Confabulation is associated with several characteristics: # Typically verbal statements but can also be non-verbal gestures or actions. # Can include autobiographical and non-personal information, such as historical facts, fairy-tales, or other aspects of semantic memory. # The account can be fantastic or coherent. # Both the premise and the details of the account can be false. # The account is usually drawn from the patient's memory of actual experiences, including past and current thoughts. # The patient is unaware of the accounts' distortions or inappropriateness, and is not concerned when errors are pointed out. # There is no hidden motivation behind the account. # The patient's personality structure may play a role in his/her readiness to confabulate. Theories Theories of confabulation range in emphasis. Some theories propose that confabulations represent a way for memory-disabled people to maintain their self-identity. Other theories use neurocognitive links to explain the process of confabulation. Still other theories frame confabulation around the more familiar concept of delusion. Other researchers frame confabulation within the fuzzy-trace theory. Finally, some researchers call for theories that rely less on neurocognitive explanations and more on epistemic accounts. =Neuropsychological theories= The most popular theories of confabulation come from the field of neuropsychology or cognitive neuroscience. Research suggests that confabulation is associated with dysfunction of cognitive processes that control the retrieval from long-term memory. Frontal lobe damage often disrupts this process, preventing the retrieval of information and the evaluation of its output. Furthermore, researchers argue that confabulation is a disorder resulting from failed \\"reality monitoring/source monitoring\\" (i.e. deciding whether a memory is based on an actual event or whether it is imagined).Johnson, M.K. (1991). Reality monitoring: Evidence from confabulation in organic brain disease patients. In G.P. Prigatano & D.L. Schacter (Eds.), Awareness of deficit after brain injury. pp. 176‚Äì97. New York: Oxford. Some neuropsychologists suggest that errors in retrieval of information from long-term memory that are made by normal subjects involve different components of control processes than errors made by confabulators. Kraepelin distinguished two subtypes of confabulation, one of which he called simple confabulation, caused partly by errors in the temporal ordering of real events. The other variety he called fantastic confabulation, which was bizarre and patently impossible statements not rooted in true memory. Simple confabulation may result from damage to memory systems in the medial temporal lobe. Fantastic confabulations reveal a dysfunction of the Supervisory System,Norman, D.A., & Shallice, T. (1980). Attention to action. Willed and automatic control of behavior. University of California San Diego CHIP Report 99. Later published as: which is believed to be a function of the frontal cortex. =Self-identity theory= Some argue confabulations have a self-serving, emotional component in those with memory deficits that aids to maintain a coherent self-concept. In other words, people who confabulate are motivated to do so, because they have gaps in their memory that they want to fill in and cover up. =Temporality theory= Support for the temporality account suggests that confabulations occur when an individual is unable to place events properly in time. Thus, an individual might correctly state an action he/she performed, but say he/she did it yesterday, when he/she did it weeks ago. In the Memory, Consciousness, and Temporality Theory, confabulation occurs because of a deficit in temporal consciousness or awareness. =Monitoring theory= Along a similar notion are the theories of reality and source monitoring theories. In these theories, confabulation occurs when individuals incorrectly attribute memories as reality, or incorrectly attribute memories to a certain source. Thus, an individual might claim an imagined event happened in reality, or that a friend told him/her about an event he/she actually heard about on television. =Strategic retrieval account theory= Supporters of the strategic retrieval account suggest that confabulations occur when an individual cannot actively monitor a memory for truthfulness after its retrieval. An individual recalls a memory, but there is some deficit after recall that interferes with the person establishing its falseness. =Executive control theory= Still others propose that all types of false memories, including confabulation, fit into a general memory and executive function model. In 2007, a framework for confabulation was proposed that stated confabulation is the result of two things: Problems with executive control and problems with evaluation. In the executive control deficit, the incorrect memory is retrieved from the brain. In the evaluative deficit, the memory will be accepted as a truth due to an inability to distinguish a belief from an actual memory. =In the context of delusion theories= Recent models of confabulation have attempted to build upon the link between delusion and confabulation. More recently, a monitoring account for delusion, applied to confabulation, proposed both the inclusion of conscious and unconscious processing. The claim was that by encompassing the notion of both processes, spontaneous versus provoked confabulations could be better explained. In other words, there are two ways to confabulate. One is the unconscious, spontaneous way in which a memory goes through no logical, explanatory processing. The other is the conscious, provoked way in which a memory is recalled intentionally by the individual to explain something confusing or unusual. =Fuzzy-trace theory= Fuzzy-trace theory, or FTT, is a concept more commonly applied to the explanation of judgement decisions. According to this theory, memories are encoded generally (gist), as well as specifically (verbatim). Thus, a confabulation could result from recalling the incorrect verbatim memory or from being able to recall the gist portion, but not the verbatim portion, of a memory. FTT uses a set of five principles to explain false-memory phenomena. Principle 1 suggests that subjects store verbatim information and gist information parallel to one another. Both forms of storage involve the surface content of an experience. Principle 2 shares factors of retrieval of gist and verbatim traces. Principle 3 is based on dual-opponent processes in false memory. Generally, gist retrieval supports false memory, while verbatim retrieval suppresses it. Developmental variability is the topic of Principle 4. As a child develops into an adult, there is obvious improvement in the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of both verbatim and gist memory. However, during late adulthood, there will be a decline in these abilities. Finally, Principle 5 explains that verbatim and gist processing cause vivid remembering. Fuzzy-trace Theory, governed by these 5 principles, has proved useful in explaining false memory and generating new predictions about it.Brainerd, C. J., & Reyna, V. F. (2002). Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory. Current Directions In Psychological Science (Wiley‚ÄìBlackwell), 11(5), 164‚Äì69. =Epistemic theory= However, not all accounts are so embedded in the neurocognitive aspects of confabulation. Some attribute confabulation to epistemic accounts. In 2009, theories underlying the causation and mechanisms for confabulation were criticized for their focus on neural processes, which are somewhat unclear, as well as their emphasis on the negativity of false remembering. Researchers proposed that an epistemic account of confabulation would be more encompassing of both the advantages and disadvantages of the process. Presentation =Associated neurological and psychological conditions= Confabulations are often symptoms of various syndromes and psychopathologies in the adult population including: Korsakoff's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury. Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome is a neurological disorder typically characterized by years of chronic alcohol abuse and a nutritional thiamine deficiency. Confabulation is one salient symptom of this syndrome.Kessels RP, Kortrijk HE, Wester AJ, Nys GM. Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff's syndrome: role of source memory and executive functioning. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2008 Apr; 62(2) 220‚Äì25. A study on confabulation in Korsakoff's patients found that they are subject to provoked confabulation when prompted with questions pertaining to episodic memory, not semantic memory, and when prompted with questions where the appropriate response would be \\"I don‚Äôt know.\\" This suggests that confabulation in these patients is \\"domain- specific.\\" Korsakoff's patients who confabulate are more likely than healthy adults to falsely recognize distractor words, suggesting that false recognition is a \\"confabulatory behavior.\\" Alzheimer's disease is a condition with both neurological and psychological components. It is a form of dementia associated with severe frontal lobe dysfunction. Confabulation in individuals with Alzheimer's is often more spontaneous than it is in other conditions, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Alzheimer's patients demonstrate comparable abilities to encode information as healthy elderly adults, suggesting that impairments in encoding are not associated with confabulation. However, as seen in Korsakoff's patients, confabulation in Alzheimer's patients is higher when prompted with questions investigating episodic memory. Researchers suggest this is due to damage in the posterior cortical regions of the brain, which is a symptom characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease. Schizophrenia is a psychological disorder in which confabulation is sometimes observed. Although confabulation is usually coherent in its presentation, confabulations of schizophrenic patients are often delusionalWing, J. K., Cooper, J. E., Sartorius, N. 1974. The description and classification of psychiatric symptoms: An instruction manual for the PSE and catego system. London: Cambridge University Press. Researchers have noted that these patients tend to make up delusions on the spot which are often fantastic and become increasingly elaborate with questioning. Unlike patients with Korsakoff's and Alzheimer's, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to confabulate when prompted with questions regarding their semantic memories, as opposed to episodic memory prompting. In addition, confabulation does not appear to be related to any memory deficit in schizophrenic patients. This is contrary to most forms of confabulation. Also, confabulations made by schizophrenic patients often do not involve the creation of new information, but instead involve an attempt by the patient to reconstruct actual details of a past event. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can also result in confabulation. Research has shown that patients with damage to the inferior medial frontal lobe confabulate significantly more than patients with damage to the posterior area and healthy controls. This suggests that this region is key in producing confabulatory responses, and that memory deficit is important but not necessary in confabulation. Additionally, research suggests that confabulation can be seen in patients with frontal lobe syndrome, which involves an insult to the frontal lobe as a result of disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Finally, rupture of the anterior or posterior communicating artery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and encephalitis are also possible causes of confabulation. =Location of brain lesions= Confabulation is believed to be a result of damage to the right frontal lobe of the brain. In particular, damage can be localized to the ventromedial frontal lobes and other structures fed by the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), including the basal forebrain, septum, fornix, cingulate gyrus, cingulum, anterior hypothalamus, and head of the caudate nucleus. =Developmental differences= While some recent literature has suggested that older adults may be more susceptible than their younger counterparts to have false memories, the majority of research on forced confabulation centers around children. Children are particularly susceptible to forced confabulations based on their high suggestibility. When forced to recall confabulated events, children are less likely to remember that they had previously confabulated these situations, and they are more likely than their adult counterparts to come to remember these confabulations as real events that transpired. Research suggests that this inability to distinguish between past confabulatory and real events is centered on developmental differences in source monitoring. Due to underdeveloped encoding and critical reasoning skills, children's ability to distinguish real memories from false memories may be impaired. It may also be that younger children lack the meta-memory processes required to remember confabulated versus non-confabulated events. Children's meta-memory processes may also be influenced by expectancies or biases, in that they believe that highly plausible false scenarios are not confabulated. However, when knowingly being tested for accuracy, children are more likely to respond, \\"I don‚Äôt know\\" at a rate comparable to adults for unanswerable questions than they are to confabulate. Ultimately, misinformation effects can be minimized by tailoring individual interviews to the specific developmental stage, often based on age, of the participant. =Provoked versus spontaneous confabulations= There is evidence to support different cognitive mechanisms for provoked and spontaneous confabulation. One study suggested that spontaneous confabulation may be a result of an amnesic patient's inability to distinguish the chronological order of events in their memory. In contrast, provoked confabulation may be a compensatory mechanism, in which the patient tries to make up for their memory deficiency by attempting to demonstrate competency in recollection. =Confidence in false memories= Confabulation of events or situations may lead to an eventual acceptance of the confabulated information as true. For instance, people who knowingly lie about a situation may eventually come to believe that their lies are truthful with time. In an interview setting, people are more likely to confabulate in situations in which they are presented false information by another person, as opposed to when they self-generate these falsehoods. Further, people are more likely to accept false information as true when they are interviewed at a later time (after the event in question) than those who are interviewed immediately or soon after the event. Affirmative feedback for confabulated responses is also shown to increase the confabulator's confidence in their response. For instance, in culprit identification, if a witness falsely identifies a member of a line-up, he will be more confident in his identification if the interviewer provides affirmative feedback. This effect of confirmatory feedback appears to last over time, as witnesses will even remember the confabulated information months later. =Among normal subjects= On rare occasions, confabulation can also be seen in normal subjects. It is currently unclear how completely healthy individuals produce confabulations. It is possible that these individuals are in the process of developing some type of organic condition that is causing their confabulation symptoms. It is not uncommon, however, for the general population to display some very mild symptoms of provoked confabulations. Subtle distortions and intrusions in memory are commonly produced by normal subjects when they remember something poorly. Diagnosis and treatment Spontaneous confabulations, due to their involuntary nature, cannot be manipulated in a laboratory setting. However, provoked confabulations can be researched in various theoretical contexts. The mechanisms found to underlie provoked confabulations can be applied to spontaneous confabulation mechanisms. The basic premise of researching confabulation comprises finding errors and distortions in memory tests of an individual. =Deese‚ÄìRoediger‚ÄìMcDermott lists= Confabulations can be detected in the context of the Deese‚ÄìRoediger‚ÄìMcDermott paradigm by using the Deese‚ÄìRoediger‚ÄìMcDermott lists. Participants listen to audio recordings of several lists of words centered around a theme, known as the critical word. The participants are later asked to recall the words on their list. If the participant recalls the critical word, which was never explicitly stated in the list, it is considered a confabulation. Participants often have a false memory for the critical word. =Recognition tasks= Confabulations can also be researched by using continuous recognition tasks. These tasks are often used in conjunction with confidence ratings. Generally, in a recognition task, participants are rapidly presented with pictures. Some of these pictures are shown once; others are shown multiple times. Participants press a key if they have seen the picture previously. Following a period of time, participants repeat the task. More errors on the second task, versus the first, are indicative of confusion, representing false memories. =Free recall tasks= Confabulations can also be detected using a free recall task, such as a self-narrative task. Participants are asked to recall stories (semantic or autobiographical) that are highly familiar to them. The stories recalled are encoded for errors that could be classified as distortions in memory. Distortions could include falsifying true story elements or including details from a completely different story. Errors such as these would be indicative of confabulations. =Treatment= Treatment for confabulation is somewhat dependent on the cause or source, if identifiable. For example, treatment of Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome involves large doses of vitamin B in order to reverse the thiamine deficiency. If there is no known physiological cause, more general cognitive techniques may be used to treat confabulation. A case study published in 2000 showed that Self-Monitoring Training (SMT) reduced delusional confabulations. Furthermore, improvements were maintained at a three-month follow-up and were found to generalize to everyday settings. Although this treatment seems promising, more rigorous research is necessary to determine the efficacy of SMT in the general confabulation population. Research Although significant gains have been made in the understanding of confabulation in recent years, there is still much to be learned. One group of researchers in particular has laid out several important questions for future study. They suggest more information is needed regarding the neural systems that support the different cognitive processes necessary for normal source monitoring. They also proposed the idea of developing a standard neuro-psychological test battery able to discriminate between the different types of confabulations. And there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the best approach to organizing and combining neuro-imaging, pharmacological, and cognitive/behavioral approaches to understand confabulation. In a recent review article, another group of researchers contemplate issues concerning the distinctions between delusions and confabulation. They question whether delusions and confabulation should be considered distinct or overlapping disorders and, if overlapping, to what degree? They also discuss the role of unconscious processes in confabulation. Some researchers suggest that unconscious emotional and motivational processes are potentially just as important as cognitive and memory problems. Finally, they raise the question of where to draw the line between the pathological and the nonpathological. Delusion-like beliefs and confabulation-like fabrications are commonly seen in healthy individuals. What are the important differences between patients with similar etiology who do and do not confabulate? Since the line between pathological and nonpathological is likely blurry, should we take a more dimensional approach to confabulation? Research suggests that confabulation occurs along a continuum of implausibility, bizarreness, content, conviction, preoccupation, and distress, and impact on daily life.

The temple is incarnated by the hymns of Thevaram and is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is incarnated by the hymns of Sundarar,History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 A.D. P.26. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar Ramalinga Swamigal and Arunagirinathar. History Thirumullaivoyal is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Chamapaka forest and hence called Chamapakavanam. In ancient times, the forest surrounding Tirumullaivayil was occupied by two notorious tribesmen, Vaanan and Onan from the Kurumbar tribe. King Thondaiman, the then ruler of the land, wanted to put an end to their atrocities. All his attempts went futile and finally he decided to defeat them in war. He set out for the war with all his infantry and cavalry with elephants and chariots. En route to the war, they waded through a dense growth of Mullai plants (Jasmine climbers). The foot of the elephant on which he was mounted was entangled in the dense foliage. The king and his men, in an attempt to free the elephant from this mess, went on to cut the wild twines with their swords and daggers. Suddenly they noticed blood gushing out from the leaves and found a 'lingam' bleeding. Shocked, the King was in great distress that he has committed a sin. Seeking mercy and forgiveness from Lord Shiva, he prayed to Him. Without any delay Lord Shiva and Parvathi appeared before the King lest he indulge in causing self- inflicted injury out of grief. The Lord asked the King to build a temple for Him right there and promised that he would reside there as 'Masilamaniswara', the Lord who is as precious as a gem, but without stains ['maasu' - dirty or stain (caused by the profuse bleeding), 'ila' - without, 'mani' - gem]. It is believed that the Lord also promised to support him in destroying the Kurumbars by sending his holy steed, the Nandi bull. On his orders, the Nandi also gets ready to go and fight for the King. This is why the Nandi in this temple faces outwards, ready to leave for the battle on the orders of the Lord, whereas in all other Shiva temples, it faces inwards facing the Lord. The positions of the deities - Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi (Kodiyidai Amman) is also found to be interchanged as against what is usually found in Shiva temples. It is believed to be so because the Lord and His Consort were in a hurry to give 'Dar≈õana' (holy appearance) to the King. With the Lord's blessings and Nandi's support, the King did win over the battle and proceeded to his capital. As a memoir of the victory, he seized a very prized possession of the Kurumbars‚Äîtwo pillars made of the tree trunk of 'Vellerukku' (white Crown flower - Calotropis gigantea). These pillars can be seen even today placed on both sides, decorating the sanctum sanctorum of the Lord. Architecture The vimana (roof) of the sanctum sanctorum is designed in a special way that is exclusive to Pallava architecture - the Gaja Prishtam, that looks like the rear of an elephant (Gaja - elephant, prishtam - rear). It is built on a circular base and is known as Thoonganai Maadam in Tamil [thoong(um) - sleeping, aanai - elephant, maadam - top of a building (or temple)] or simply, 'a building that looks like the rear of a sleeping elephant'. Kodiyidai Nayagi thumb The Goddess is called Kodiyidai Nayagi - She who has a waist as slender as the Jasmine climber. She is considered to be a very powerful deity and is known to bestow Her gracious blessings for newly weds, unwed girls for speedy marriage and for a happy wedded life. She and Her counterparts, Tiruvudai Amman Thirumanangeeswarar Temple- She who symbolises Lakshmi and Vadivudai Amman Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvottiyur- She who is resplendent with her gracious beauty, are believed to be three Great Goddesses who shower all auspicious things in life if visited and worshipped on the same day of Chitra Pournami - the full moon day in the Tamil month of Chithirai. * Tiruvudai Amman, Melur: Icha Shakthi * Vadivudai Amman, Tiruvotriyur: Gnana Shakthi * Kodiyidai Amman, Tirumullaivayil: Kriya Shakthi Festivals Every year in the month of Chittirai(Mar-Apr), on Sadaya nakshatra(Sadayam star), the Santhana kappu is refurbished with Veru kappu.

The company is a subsidiary of Big Hit Entertainment, and is home to actress Nana and K-pop artists NU'EST and Seventeen. Its name originates from the pleiades, a star cluster in the constellation Taurus.  History  =2007‚Äì2012: Founding and early artists= Pledis Entertainment was founded in 2007. Son Dam-bi was the first artist to debut under Pledis, and was dubbed the 'female Rain' by media outlets. In its beginning stages, the agency did not have management premises, only a practice room. In January 2009, Pledis debuted its first girl group, After School. A sub-unit of After School called Orange Caramel was formed in 2010, consisting of members Nana, Lizzy, and Raina. In December 2010, Pledis released Happy Pledis 1st Album, featuring After School, which included the tracks \\"Love Love Love\\" and \\"Someone Is You\\". Happy Pledis was a series of albums to be released annually, featuring Pledis artists, with proceeds going to charity. Proceeds from the first album were donated to Save the Children. In July 2011, two further sub- units of After School were created, A.S. Red and A.S. Blue. Happy Pledis 2nd Album, featuring Son Dam-bi, After School, Pledis Boys, and Yoo Ara, was released in December, with proceeds going to UNICEF. = 2012‚Äìpresent: Joint ventures and development = In March 2012, Pledis debuted their first boy band NU‚ÄôEST. In May 2012, the agency joint ventures with Fantagio and debuted a six-member girl group, Hello Venus. In June 2012, Kahi \\"graduated\\" from After School and continued with her solo career under Pledis. On November 11, 2013, Pledis Entertainment and Chinese agency Yuehua Entertainment held a press conference titled \\"Yuehua Entertainment X Pledis\\" at the Beijing Banquet Hall, marking the start of a collaboration under which the sub-unit NU'EST-M was formed with the addition of Chinese member Jason Fulong Fei, known as JA. The six-member team performed for the first time at the press event. On July 21, 2014, the partnership between Pledis and Fantagio was dissolved. The two members under Pledis, Yoo Ara and Yoonjo, left Hello Venus while the four members under Fantagio continued as a group under the same name. In December 2014, Jooyeon graduated from After School after her contract expired. That month, Kahi announced to parted ways with the agency. Thirteen-member boy group Seventeen debuted in May 2015, after training under the company for several years. In June 2015, Son Dam-bi parted ways with the agency after ten years. In March 2016, Pledis formed a pre-debut team called \\"Pledis Girlz\\". Some of the pre-debut team members Nayoung, Roa, Yuha, Eunwoo, Rena, Kyulkyung and Xiyeon had competed in the survival show Produce 101 and concluded the show with two members, Nayoung and Kyulkyung, debuting in the survival project girl group I.O.I. Before their debut, Pledis Girlz held concerts which the members performed weekly from May 2016 until January 2017 and also released their pre-debut single titled \\"WE\\", with the exception of Nayoung and Kyulkyung, who were still promoting with I.O.I at the time. In January 2017, Pledis Girlz concluded their weekly concerts with announcement of the official group name Pristin, following Nayoung and Kyulkyung wrap up their activities with I.O.I in the same months. Pristin officially debuted as a ten-member girl group in March 2017. On May 31, 2017, UEE graduated from After School after her contract expired. In May 2018, Lizzy graduated from After School following the expiration of her contract, but remains a member of Orange Caramel. In June 2018, it was confirmed that After School member Kaeun and Huh Yunjin, a trainee, would participate on the survival show series Produce 48. At the end of the show, it was revealed that Kaeun placed 14th overall and Yunjin placed 26th. Both failed to make it into the final lineup of the winning group, Iz*One. On May 24, 2019, Pristin was officially disbanded. Pledis announced that while Kyulkyung, Yehana, and Sungyeon would stay with the company, the remaining seven (Xiyeon, Rena, Roa, Kyla, Nayoung, Yuha, and Eunwoo) would be departing. On July 6, 2019, Kaeun graduated from After School following the expiration of her contract. On December 20, 2019, Han Dong-geun parted ways with Pledis Entertaiment. On December 27, 2019, Raina graduated from After School following the expiration of her contract. On January 16, 2020, After School's E-Young announced that she has left Pledis Entertaiment with the expiration of her contract. On May 25, 2020, Big Hit Entertainment officially announced the acquisition of a majority shareholder of Pledis Entertainment. It was also announced that Pledis Entertainment will receive financial and expertise support from Big Hit while still operating as an independent label.

Currently the painting is in the collection of the Jagiellonian University of Krak√≥w, which purchased it from a private owner with money donated by the Polish public. The painting presently adorns the Aula of the Collegium Novum of the University. As with many other works, Matejko painted his artwork in 1872 as part of a series of paintings intended to represent profound moments in the history of Poland. History Painting of Copernicus, 1872, Matejko's self-caricature drawing Matejko began his work on this painting in 1871, in preparation for the celebrations of the anniversary of Copernicus's 400th birthday. As with most of his works, it was part of his efforts to represent profound moments in the history of Poland. He studied materials available in the Jagiellonian University, and prepared several pencil and two oil sketches before finishing the final painting. He began work on the final painting in the summer of 1872 in the cramped conditions of his old apartment in Krak√≥w, which he portrayed in the ironic self-Portrait (he would finish Astronomer Copernicus... in a new studio in early 1873). The organizers of the festivities in Krak√≥w were not supportive of Matejko's endeavour, and did not plan to display his painting during the official festivities. The German council of Toru≈Ñ approached Matejko with an offer to buy it, but he refused, probably motivated by Polish patriotism, preferring instead to organize his own exhibition in Krak√≥w. He was able to organize a display in February, in Krak√≥w's City Council building, the Wielopolski Palace; profits from the display were donated to charity. The reception of the painting was mixed; later that year it was displayed in Vienna. In March the community of Krak√≥w decided to buy the painting for 12,000 Polish zloty, and it was donated to the Jagiellonian University, where it has been on public display in the Collegium Novum building ever since. Analysis The painting depicts a kneeling, inspired Nicolaus Copernicus observing the heavens transitioning from night to dawn. He is on a balcony, near or at the cathedral in Frombork, surrounded by various astronomical tools and aids. The scene likely portrays the epiphany moment of Copernicus profound discovery, with his own Heliocentric model drawn on a large flat board (based on an illustration from De revolutionibus) standing next to him. The exact location depicted by Matejko is fictional; modern scholars are still looking for the exact location of the Copernicus observatory, and agree that Matejko's portrayal was more of a \\"romantic vision\\". Whereas Matejko shows Copernicus on a tower, in reality his small observatory was probably set up at ground level, possibly in the gardens near his house. The main features of the composition include a symmetrical focal point with atmospheric perspective around the subject, a radial balance of light arranged around a central element, and dramatic contrasts with dark colours in the periphery. Copernicus's epiphany or ecstasy is captured through the skillful use of lighting. The models for Copernicus are known to have been Doctor Henryk Levittoux and Matejko's nephew, Antoni Serafi≈Ñski. Matejko's most famous paintings are usually large group scenes; individual scenes like this are more of an exception for him.

Life =Early life= Petar Popoviƒá was born into a Serbian Orthodox family in the village of Bu≈°eviƒá, in Krupa na Uni (modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina), in 1826. His father's name was Petar and his mother was Ilinka. He spent the greater part of his life in Bosanska Kostajnica. He was an autodidact, apart from Serbian he also spoke Turkish. As an opponent to the Ottoman state, Petar, at only 22 years of age in 1848, joined the hajduks and actively, for the rest of his life, fought the Ottomans. =Pecija's First Revolt= In mid-1858, an uprising broke out in northwestern Bosnia, resulting from Ottoman pressure against the local Serb populace. In Ivanjska in the Krupa nahiyah, the Serb population of that Catholic-majority village rose up. After short shootings around Ivanjska, the other villages took up arms. It is said that it originated in zulum (tyranny) from the Ottomans. In June 1858, the uprising expanded on to Kne≈°polje. The leaders were former hajduk (bandit) Petar Popoviƒá‚ÄìPecija, Petar Garaƒça (d. 1858), Simo ƒÜosiƒá and Risto Jeiƒá. The rural population of Kne≈°polje was predominantly consisting of Serbian Orthodox people, while the Muslim population predominantly lived in the cities. On June 20, the rebels pushed the Muslims into the city of Novi. Around 600 rebels summoned outside Novi, planning to attack the city. At the same time, Pecija and Garaƒça had summoned around 3,000 rebels, which entered Ivanjska in order to help the local rebels. On July 4, in the battle of Doljani near Bihaƒá, some 100 Turks fell, after which Jeiƒá crossed into Austria, trying to convince the Austrians that these peasants with pitchforks and scythes were worth more than to live off bread. On July 15, the foothold at Ivanjska fell, where Pecija and Garaƒça were. The rebel bands near Ivanjska were heavily defeated, with Pecija and Garaƒça leading the survived rebels into Kne≈°polje, from where they gave their final resistance. At this time the Ottoman troops were strengthened with aiding detachments which were sent from all regions of Bosnia, and on July 21, the battle on Tavija near modern Kostajnica took place. Around 1,000 rebels defended their trenches, but they could not resist, and most of them decided to flee to Austria after the defeat. The next day, a battle was fought near the village of Kuljan. Pecija and Garaƒça, weakened from the leaving of a larger number of rebels for the other side of the Una river (Austrian territory), did not have the strength to give serious resistance to the well- organized Ottoman army, so they decided to also flee to Austria. However the Austrians denied them protection, and sought to disarm them and hand over them to the Ottoman government; Pecija and Garaƒça decided to not surrender, and with some 300 rebels they broke the Ottoman blockade and fled up into the Prosar mountain. The next months, Pecija and Garaƒça continued to fight a guerilla war over Kne≈°polje, however, the large-scale uprising had been crushed. In December, Garaƒça was killed near Kostajnica. After Garaƒça's death, Pecija decided to retreat into Austria, however, the Austrian government caught him in surprise and delivered him to the Ottomans for a prize of 5,000 groschen. Pecija was taken to Constantinople to stand trial. There he was sentenced to death, for, according to the charges, killing 98 Turks. The death sentence was to be carried out in the Bosnia Eyalet, in his hometown. During the trip, leaving Constantinople, Pecija managed to escape near U≈æice, and moved to the Principality of Serbia. =Stay at Kragujevac and Belgrade= He escaped to Serbia, of which period there is little information. According to Archimandrite S. Vujasinoviƒá he was welcomed by Prince Mihailo, who appointed him guard in Kragujevac; according to D. Aleksiƒá he worked in the Kragujevac foundry; according to M. Ekmeƒçiƒá he was a pandur (guard) in the Kragujevac foundry. He stayed in Serbia until the uprising broke out in the Bosnia Vilayet in 1875. =Bosanska Krajina Uprising= Leaders and Heroes of the Uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina, illustration in the Serb calendar Orao (1876). Pecija is depicted in the lower side. He immediately joined the uprising in Bosanska Krajina (1875), and fought in Ga≈°nica on 28 August. Pecija once again proved to be one of the most capable leaders as he forced the Ottomans into flight. However, shortly afterwards, according to folk telling due to treason by Ilija ƒåolanoviƒá, the Ottomans surprised the rebels and after a lengthy and violent fight destroyed the hajduk band, with some fleeing to Prosar, and only some 50 remaining with Pecija to continue the fight on the Sava banks. Pecija and his rebels managed to seize a boat and cross the river, but without protection, most of the men died from Ottoman gunfire. Only Pecija and two men remained alive, and Pecija, restless and courageous as he was, instead of escaping, went out in the open and shouted \\"Hey, Turks, just to let you know, you did not kill Pecija, he is still alive, and he will soon avenge you.\\" A bullet struck him in the head and he died instantly, on the night of 29 August 1875. Pecija, together with Kormano≈° and the other men were buried in the village of Jablanac, under Jasenovac. A decade after his death, Pecija's remains were relocated and properly stored in the Mo≈°tanica monastery, at the foot of Kozara near Kozarska Dubica. Legacy Monument outside the Monastery Mo≈°tanica, the burial ground of Hajduk Pecija. After the death of Pecija, he was buried on the Austrian side of the Sava, near Jasenovac. The Serbs were not allowed to move his remains to Bosnia. Serbs from Kozarska Dubica, among whom were Ostoja Kosanoviƒá, Jovo Subanoviƒá, Dimitrije Misaljeviƒá, started the initiative for the relocation of Pecija's remains to Bosnia in 1901, for a burial with dignity. They, with a priest from Mlaka, agreed upon to secretly dig up the remains and transfer them to Kozarska Dubica, where Pecija's remains were stored on the attic of Jovan Jajƒçanin. When the Austrians learned of this, Jajƒçanin and the others transferred his remains to the Mo≈°tanica monastery, where he was buried. Archimandrite Kiril Had≈æiƒá of Mo≈°tanica granted rights for his burial in the monastery (1885‚Äì86). In 1910, at the reguest of the Serbian people, hegumen Ivanƒçiƒá blessed his grave. In 1933 a memorial dedicated to Pecija was erected, placed outside Mo≈°tanica.

He is best known for his work in the hip hop group Glue and for winning the Scribble Jam Emcee Battle in 1998 and 2001. Early life Adeem began rapping at age 15, when he started a group called Mellow Minds with a pair of local rappers in Keene, New Hampshire. The group appeared on Keene State College Radio from 1994‚Äì1996, where Adeem began to freestyle. In 1996, Adeem met DJ MF Shalem, and the two began working on routines and choreographing a live set. Career In 1998, during a trip to Portland, Maine, rapper Sole convinced Adeem to attend Scribble Jam to perform with his group, The Live Poets. Adeem did not intend to participate in the emcee battle that year, but his friends registered him to compete anyway. After eliminating Atmosphere's Slug in the final round, Adeem won the Emcee Battle‚Äî it was his first victory in an organized competition. The day after the battle, Mr. Dibbs expanded the 1200 Hobos DJ Crew to include emcees; Adeem was invited to the crew along with Buck 65, Sixtoo, Slug, Doseone, Eyedea, Adverse, Sole, and Alias. Although the crew did not release any projects as a collective, Adeem claimed membership in the group for many years. In late 1998, Adeem met Sage Francis at an open mic event in Providence, Rhode Island. The two artists collaborated and played shows together for a few years afterwards. In 1999, Adeem and Sage flew to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and recorded a 30-minute song with Buck 65 and Sixtoo, which became known as \\"The Untitled Canadian Recordings\\". During this time, Adeem and Sage collaborated with Sole and Alias to produce \\"I'm Afraid\\", which was released on Sage Francis' Sick of Waiting‚Ä¶ in 1999. Later in 1999 Adeem and DJ MF Shalem recorded their first album, The First Few Inches, on cassette tape. The album, almost exclusively produced by Shalem, was individually dubbed, and all inserts were cut by hand. The album featured a guest verse by Adverse, who joined Adeem and Shalem in 2000 to create a group called The Dorian Three. In the following years, The Dorian Three produced two albums and toured nationally. During the summer of 2001, Adeem finished his first solo album, Sweet Talking Your Brain. The album was produced by the Vinyl Monkeys (MF Shalem, The Eclectic, Elektro4, Scott Matelic, Moodswing9, DJ Mayonnaise, Maker) and was self-released in the fall of 2001. The album was later licensed by Syntax Records in the USA and by Tri Eight Records in Japan in 2002. Tri Eight subsequently pressed a 12-inch single with the tracks \\"Sweet Talk\\", \\"Forgotten Habit\\", and \\"Stargazing\\". Adeem entered the emcee battle at Scribble Jam again in 2001. He won by defeating battle heavyweights like Sage Francis, Blueprint, and Mac Lethal. At the time, nobody had ever won the emcee battle more than once in the history of the hip-hop festival. Because his longtime partner, DJ MF Shalem, was occupied as Sage Francis' tour DJ, Adeem connected with DJ DQ with the intent to create a touring act. At approximately this time, Maker, a producer from Them Badd Apples in Chicago, sent Adeem a collection of beats over which to rap. After successful projects with both DJ DQ and Maker, the trio decided to visit Maker in Aurora, Illinois, to create a touring act. The group, originally called Seconds Away, ultimately became Glue. In 2003, Adeem was chosen to compete in an emcee battle on Last Call with Carson Daly. He finished in second place, behind Breeze Evahflowin. The final battle lasted two rounds, only one of which was aired by NBC. In 2004, Glue released its first album, Seconds Away, to critical success from trade publications and the blogosphere. That summer, Glue was asked to play at the Warped Tour with a set at every show that summer. Catch as Catch Can was ultimately released on September 16, 2006, to critical acclaim; almost 10,000 copies of the album were sold worldwide. Glue supported the album with three coast-to-coast tours between 2006 and 2007, playing with acts like Solillaquists of Sound, X:144 & SPS, and Hangar 18. In January 2008, MTV2 featured Glue on its On the Rise program, highlighting the group as an innovative, new hip-hop group from Chicago. The group toured briefly in 2008 but decided to take a break before working on its next album. The Volume in the Ground, released in May 2011, featured collaboration with DJ MF Shalem, Maker, Chadeo, and Nobs. Adeem recorded vocals in Orlando, Florida, with Solillaquists of Sound members Swamburger and Alexandrah. The album was released, DIY, on Winners Never Sleep Records. In early 2011, Adeem and DJ MF Shalem began working on a follow-up to their 2004 album. Titled Made in New Hampshire, it was intended for release in October 2011. Personal life Adeem lives in Keene, New Hampshire, with his wife and daughter.

It serves not only as a pedestrian connector between the Circle Centre Mall and nearby buildings, but also as a venue for the display and performance of artistic and musical works (more than 300 performances take place in the Artsgarden each year). In addition, the Artsgarden houses the Cultural Concierge, who provides local arts and cultural information, maps, and visitor guides. The structure, including the walkways connecting it to the adjacent buildings, is owned and operated by the Arts Council of Indianapolis. The Artsgarden was designed by Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects who also designed the adjacent Circle Centre Mall. Blackburn Architects collaborated on the design and execution. The $12 million cost was funded by Lilly Endowment. View from inside the Artsgarden The floor of the Artsgarden stands above the intersection. A series of arched steel trusses creates a graduated set of glassed vaults, the tallest of which is above the floor and above the street. The design yields a total free-span length of within the dome. A total of of glass is used in the structure to give it an airy, open feel. The entire dome is set on two pairs of plate girders that diagonally span the intersection. When initially constructed in 1995, the Artsgarden connected the second level of Circle Centre Mall on the southeast corner of the intersection with an upper level of the Claypool Courts on the northwest corner, while stairways provided access to the ground-level sidewalks on the northeast and southwest corners. In 2006 the Conrad Indianapolis was built on the site of the small park that had been on the northeast corner and the stairway there was replaced with a direct connection to the hotel. In 2011 construction was started on a connector to the 16-story PNC Center and Hyatt Regency hotel complex on the southwest corner. The owners of the complex in 1995 had declined to help pay for the connector; in 2010 an agreement was reached to split the $1.2 million cost, allowing fulfillment of the original concept of the Artsgarden. The connector was completed in January, 2012.

Walter Andersen, a scholar who has studied the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), said that \\"for the expert on South Asia, this book is an absolute must.\\" Craig Baxter, another author, said that it was required for anyone with an interest in South Asia. Stacey Burlet states that the book combines \\"an abundance of information\\" with \\"lucid analysis.\\" Richard White states that the book is \\"formidably well researched and explores all the main arguments and themes relating to the subject.\\" White adds that Jaffrelot ‚Äì based on the research and understanding of Indian society and politics ‚Äì predicted that the Hindu nationalist ideology-based Bharatiya Janata Party will not be able to win general elections and form the central government, a prediction that proved to be incorrect to Jaffrelot's misfortune. According to Bhagwan Josh, Jaffrelot's The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics is based on extensive fieldwork and effort making it an \\"immensely rewarding read\\", but makes a number of \\"untenable assumptions\\" regarding the nature of Indian culture, \\"Hindu consciousness/identity\\", and the nature of early Hindu nationalism within the Indian National Congress. According to T. V. Sathyamurthy, Jaffrelot's scholarship on Hindu nationalism is an important contribution with empirical depth and field research in Madhya Pradesh and the interviews of RSS members. He states that Jaffrelot's insights include Hindutva as a form of nationalism that is based on a \\"cultural criteria rather than on racial theory\\" and a view of \\"politics based on ethnic nationalism\\". Along with this and numerous other remarkable insights, Jaffrelot advocates a rubric of \\"Stigmatising and Emulating Threatening Others\\" strategy, which Satyamurthy finds to be flawed, \\"not only childish\\" but also \\"psychologically reductionist and politically nonsensical\\" in the context of India. According to Asad Abbasi of London School of Economics, Jaffrelot's book The Pakistan Paradox is a necessary text for every student interested in Pakistan. However, states Abbasi, the book is \\"littered with spelling mistakes, repetition, tense conflicts and other silly errors ‚Äî on page 130, Mumtaz Bhutto is cousin of ZA Bhutto, but by page 134 Mumtaz becomes Benazir‚Äôs cousin\\".Book Review: The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience by Christophe Jaffrelot, Asad Abbasi, LSE, UK (2016) According to Tania Patel, Jaffrelot provides \\"compelling insights for understanding the nuances of the contestations and continuities in Pakistan‚Äôs state and society\\" and elaborates \\"the country‚Äôs chronic instability in three contradictions whose roots lie in tensions apparent since the 1940s\\".

It was proposed in 2005 and came into existence in 2010. The college has 10 majors and the total enrolment is on a large scale. The entrance to the College of Teacher Educationthe College of Teacher Education of Nanjing Normal University Introduction As the southern birthplace of China's education of teachers, Nanjing Normal University has developed into a comprehensive university with a distinct feature of teacher education. The title ‚Äúthe southern birthplace of China's education of teachers‚Äù given to Nanjing Normal University is intended to honor its long history in teacher education.http://www.southcn.com/edu/kejiaobest/200209110485.htm Nanjing Normal University has a history more than 100 years, its predecessor was dating from Three Rivers Normal School which established in 1902. In this period, many celebrities were born here. They are the great Chinese educator Tao Xingzhi, the famous Chinese educator Wu Yifang, the Chinese early childhood educationist Chen Heqin the artist Xu Beihong and so on. To respond to the call of Chinese government and conform to the trend of teacher's professional development in China, the university founded the faculty of Teachers' Education in 2010. Before the foundation of the faculty, effort had been put into the project. Since the construction programme of the new undergraduate course about the teacher education was put into effort in 2005, an experience on the reformation of \\"2.5+1.5\\" developing pattern was conducted, which targeted the normal students of 2007, 2008 and 2009 on campus. When a university is on the ‚Äú2.5+1.5‚Äù developing pattern in China, the university students are expected to learn the basic and general knowledge in the beginning two and half years of university. While in the last one and half years of university, the students will be exposed to specialized and professional subjects. Double-tutors system has been set up in the course of graduation design.  The faculty today  Ten academic majors have been gathered in the faculty. They are English teachingÔºåchemistry teaching, history teaching, physics teaching, mathematics teaching, Chinese teaching, biology teaching, geography teaching, politics teaching and computer teaching. literally, these academic majors belong to the faculty of Teachers' Education. Actually, the teacher - training students are also exposed to other relevant professional resources from other colleges in Nanjing Normal University. For example, the English teaching student will be cultivated by both the College of Teacher Education and College of Foreign Languages of Nanjing Normal University. The faculty today has 112 specialized teachers with 26 professors and 34 associate professors. The dean of the faculty is Xia Jinwen (Chinese:Â§èÈî¶Êñá)who is also the vice-president of Nanjing Normal University. Students‚Äô Organizations In China, universities provide students with opportunities to challenge and promote their sophisticated abilities in addition to their academic level. In this way, various students‚Äô organizations spring like mushroom. There are four major organizations in this college. They are the Students‚Äô Union, the Youth Volunteers Association, the Youth League general branch and the Mental Weather Station. The four organizations almost cover all the aspects of students‚Äô activities. = The Students' Union = The leading organization is the Students‚Äô Union, which consists of 8 separate and distinctive departments. It is operated by students themselves for its chairman is selected from students in the college. To ensure necessary help from the college is available and punctual, a certain teacher acts as a supervisor to the organization. The organization‚Äôs responsibility is to organize varied and extensive activities on the behalf of students. =Youth League general branch= As to Youth League general league, it deals with the issues related to the Communist Youth League and the Chinese Communist Party. For example, if a student in the Teacher‚Äôs College submits an application to join the Chinese Communist Party, then the general branch will inspect the student in a certain period to find whether he or she is qualified or not. Apart from that, to assist the students to accomplish their summer social practice is what they are working on. =The Youth Volunteers Association= Volunteer work is an essential part of university life, so the Youth Volunteers Association is supposed to provide information and opportunities about the available volunteer work, both in school and in society. =The Mental Weather Station= These three organizations mentioned above are customary ones of a college while the Mental Weather Station is set aside from the Students‚Äô Union particularly. This organization caters to the affairs of state that more and more university students are suffering pressure„ÄÇ In the way, more professional advice and instant help is in touch for the students in the College of Teacher Education whenever needed.

Background and early career  It is not known when Xu Yanruo was born. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Xu Yougong (ÂæêÊúâÂäü), a famed judge during the reign of Wu Zetian.New Book of Tang, vol. 113. His family claimed to be originally descended from mythical Xia Dynasty judge Gao Yao and traced its ancestry through a line of officials of Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420), Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang Dynasty, Chen Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Xu Zai (ÂæêÂÆ∞) served as a judge at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si), and his father Xu Shang was a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Yizong. Xu Yanruo had at least four younger brothers, Xu Rensi (Âæê‰ªÅÂó£), Xu Renju (Âæê‰ªÅÁü©), Xu Renfan (Âæê‰ªÅÁØÑ), and Xu Renxu (Âæê‰ªÅÂãó).New Book of Tang, vol. 75 Xu Yanruo passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´) class in 872, during Emperor Yizong's reign. Late in the reign of Emperor Yizong's son Emperor Xizong, he became an low-level official at the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) but was given the responsibility of drafting edicts. He was later made Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng).Old Book of Tang, vol. 179.  During Emperor Zhaozong's reign  = Before chancellorship = Emperor Xizong died in 888 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Zhaozong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Emperor Zhaozong made Xu Yanruo the deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). In 891, after a failed imperial campaign against the warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), chancellors Zhang Jun and Kong Wei, who advocated for the campaign, were removed from their positions. Xu was made chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), along with Cui Zhaowei, to replace them. Xu was also made the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. = As chancellor = As of 893, the warlord Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) had defeated another warlord, Yang Shouliang the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). He submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong, offering to be the military governor of Shannan West‚Äîfully expecting that Emperor Zhaozong would allow him to be the military governor of both Fengxiang and Shannan West. Instead, Emperor Zhaozong, who wanted to take back some of the territory for the imperial government, issued an edict making Li Maozhen the military governor of Shannan West and neighboring Wuding Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆö, also headquartered in modern Hanzhong), while naming Xu Yanruo the military governor of Fengxiang. Li Maozhen, disappointed, refused to obey the edict. In fall 893, Emperor Zhaozong put Li Sizhou (ÊùéÂó£Âë®) the Prince of Qin in command of a newly conscripted imperial army to escort Xu to Fengxiang. Li Maozhen and his ally Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) reacted by mobilizing their troops, ready to face the imperial troops. The imperial troops panicked and deserted, and Li Maozhen and Wang approached the capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Zhaozong to force the chancellor Du Rangneng, whom he had put in charge of the campaign logistics despite Du's misgivings about the campaign, to commit suicide. Emperor Zhaozong was also forced to recall Xu and allow Li Maozhen to be the military governor of both Fengxiang and Shannan West. After Xu was recalled to the capital, he was made the chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. After another chancellor, Zheng Qi, retired in 894, Xu was made a chancellor again with the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi; he was also made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), as well as the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). When Li Maozhen and Wang again attacked Chang'an in 895 and killed the chancellors Wei Zhaodu and Li Xi, Emperor Zhaozong fled the capital into the Qinling Mountains. Xu, along with other chancellors Wang Tuan and Cui Zhaowei, followed him; they (and the emperor) were subsequently able to return to Chang'an after Li Keyong defeated Wang and forced Li Maozhen and another ally, Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), into temporary submission.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. After Emperor Zhaozong returned to Chang'an, he gave Xu the honorary titles of Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏) and acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies), and created him the Duke of Qi. In 896, when Li Maozhen again postured to attack Chang'an, Emperor Zhaozong and his court fled the capital, initially intending to flee to Li Keyong's Hedong Circuit. However, they became weary of the long journey there, and when Han made assurances that he was loyal to the emperor, Emperor Zhaozong and the imperial officials went to Zhenguo's capital Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û). While Emperor Zhaozong was there, apparently because Li Maozhen's soldiers had burned most of the city of Chang'an, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Xu as the overseer of Daming Palace (Â§ßÊòéÂÆÆ) and the comforter of the Chang'an region, apparently intending to have Xu be in charge of rebuilding the city, although Xu's role, if any, in the subsequent rebuilding is unclear. After Emperor Zhaozong was able to return to Chang'an in 898,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Xu was further given the title of Taibao (Â§™‰øù), above the Three Excellencies, and made Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). = After chancellorship = By fall 900, Cui Yin was the most powerful chancellor at court, and he was jealous of Xu Yanruo's status with titles above his own. Sensing this, Xu offered to resign, and further specifically asked to be the military governor of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), whose then- military governor, Li Zhirou the Prince of Xue, was one of the few remaining military governors still obedient to the imperial government and therefore would accept being replaced. Emperor Zhaozong thereafter commissioned Xu as the military governor of Qinghai and had him retain the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary designation. (As Li Zhirou died in late 900 while still serving as the military governor of Qinghai, it may be assumed that Xu did not reach Qinghai prior to Li's death.) (While on the way to Qinghai, Xu went through Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei, not the same circuit Wang Xingyu ruled). The military governor Cheng Rui held a feast for him, but brought up an old dispute between them‚ÄîXu's refusal to order the returns of Li (ÊæßÂ∑û) and Lang (ÊúóÂ∑û, both in modern Changde, Hunan) Prefectures, both of which previously belonged to Jingnan but which had since been taken by Lei Man the military governor of Wuzhen Circuit (Ê≠¶Ë≤û, headquartered at Lang Prefecture) while Xu was chancellor. Xu pointed out that Cheng was an honored military governor who compared himself to Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin, and therefore should have been able to defeat Lei himself. Cheng was embarrassed by Xu's analysis.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Xu died in late 901, while still serving as the military governor of Qinghai. In his final petition to the emperor, he recommended the commander of the Qinghai army, Liu Yin, to serve as acting military governor. (Liu's family would thereafter retain control of the circuit, and Liu's younger brother Liu Yan would eventually establish the state of Southern Han with Qinghai as its base.)Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 135.

Biography Born Margaret Ann Lewis in Snyder, Texas,bio of Lewis by Phil Davies on rockabilly.nl she moved with her family early in life to Levelland, Texas, where she grew up singing in the Baptist church choir and listening to rockabilly and rhythm & blues. In high school she formed a band, the Thunderbolts, and they took second place in a talent show in Lubbock in 1957. After some guest appearances on the Louisiana Hayride radio program, she joined the cast in 1958.

Lewis continued to record on Smith's Ram Records for several years, until the label was closed down in the early 1960s. Lewis and Smith then decided to concentrate on songwriting, and their first big success was \\"Mountain of Love\\", a country hit for David Houston in 1963. Lewis and Smith moved to Nashville and signed a deal with Shelby Singleton to write songs for his SSS International and Plantation Records labels. They wrote a number of hits for various artists from 1967‚Äì1971, perhaps the best known being Reconsider Me, which has charted for at least four different artists. Lewis continued to record at times, and she had her only chart appearance as a singer with \\"Honey (I Miss You Too)\\" (1968), which peaked at No. 74 on the country charts.

Located near Aldie, Virginia, the school was established as the Loudoun County Agricultural Institute and Chemical Academy around 1854 on a former portion of U.S. President James Monroe's Oak Hill plantation. History The institute was established by Benjamin Hyde Benton, Harmon Bitzer and James Gulick, who were active in the Agricultural Society of Loudoun, on land belonging to Gulick's family. The school lasted for only six years, suffering from the Panic of 1857 and failing in 1860. Gulick put the property up for sale, but with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, was unable to sell. Gulickjoined the Confederate Army and was killed in 1864 at the Battle of Upperville. The property was by his estate to a neighbor, Isabella Turner. Turner's estate sold the property to the Institute Corporation in 1916, whereupon the property became the headquarters for the National Beagle Club of America, which retains the property. Architecture The main house is a 3-1/2-story stuccoed stone building. The large plain building is six bays wide with a partly sunken basement. The main entrance is through a small porch offset to the right to the first floor, replacing the original entrance, which was on the opposite side facing a tiered garden. The interior remains largely as it was when the property was a school, with a central hallway on each level running the length of the building. The second floor and attic levels are partitioned into smaller rooms originally used as dormitories. The property also features 13 log cabins built between 1917 and 1971, used by the club during beagle shows and trials for lodging. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1982.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed September 18, 2011 north by northeastward-flowing stream originating just east of Skyline Boulevard in the Santa Cruz Mountains, near the community of Skylonda in San Mateo County, California. It flows through the town of Woodside before joining Sausal Creek on Stanford University lands just across the border from Woodside. Sausal Creek enters Searsville Reservoir, which flows to San Francisco Bay via San Francisquito Creek. History The namesake of Dennis Martin Creek has a fascinating history. Dennis Martin was the Canadian-American son of William Martin, who with his parents and siblings, began a cross-country trek from Missouri to California in 1844. At the urging of a Jesuit priest, the Martin family had joined two other Irish families‚Äîthe Murphys and the Sullivans‚Äîto leave Missouri in search of ‚ÄúCatholic institutions‚Äù in the West. The Stephens- Townsend-Murphy Party became the first pioneers to cross the Sierra Nevada into California. Their route was the same as that chosen by the ill-fated Donner Party two years later. Upon reaching Truckey's Lake (now Donner Lake) on November 14, 1844, the party left six of their eleven wagons because of difficulties getting the wagons over what would become Donner Pass. Eighteen- year-old Moses Schallenberger spent the winter there alone watching over the wagons, surviving the impassably deep snows only by trapping High Sierra foxes for food. The rest of the party spent the winter in the upper Yuba River valley, until most of the men were enticed to fight with Captain John Sutter for Mexican California Governor Manuel Micheltorena in exchange for promises of land grants. Instead of joining them, Dennis Martin returned to the upper Yuba with supplies for the women and children. Upon learning of the plight of Moses Schallenberger, twenty-three-year-old Martin crossed the snowbound Sierras in mid-winter to rescue Schallenberger at Donner Lake in February, 1845. Martin showed Schallenberger how to construct proper snowshoes and successfully the two recrossed the Sierras to the Central Valley. Martin worked for Captain John A. Sutter in the summer of 1845, who sent him to supervise three Indians cutting redwood on the San Francisco Peninsula. While so employed, Dennis Martin met a fellow Irishman, John Coppinger. Then Martin sought and found gold on the Mokelumne and Stanislaus Rivers in partnership with Daniel Murphy, his transcontinental companion, and Charles Maria Weber, the founder of Stockton. Quickly making his fortune in gold, Martin bought 1,500 acres of land north of San Francisquito Creek from his friend John Coppinger, the grantee of Rancho Ca√±ada de Raymundo, for $1,500. This property is now marked by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Then he purchased the wooded slopes of the creek he named for himself from the Rancho Corte de Madera including much of the modern day Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, the Ladera subdivision and the Webb Ranch. Martin established an upper and lower sawmill on Dennis Martin Creek, the lower mill about a half-mile downstream from Schilling Lake. Martin encouraged his relatives and friends in Canada and Missouri to join him, and many of these made up the early population of the historic mill town of Searsville, inundated by Searsville Dam in 1892. After financial misfortune and land disputes typical of the era, his lands were bought by Leland Stanford in November, 1882. Dennis Martin died in June 1890 and was buried at the St. Dennis Cemetery (Martin had built his own church) on his former property (by then Stanford's). The creek's watershed includes the historic Thornewood House, a 1920s estate built by Julian Thorne and surrounded by 3.5 acres of landscaping and gorgeous valley views. This 87-acre estate was willed to the Sierra Club Foundation and later given to the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District. Currently, the house and 10-acre private leasehold are closed and under restoration. Schilling Lake is named for August Schilling, the ‚ÄúKing of Spice‚Äù, who founded A. Schilling & Company in San Francisco in 1881. Schilling purchased the land from Julian Thorne, who purchased it from Edward Preston (attorney), who purchased it from the pioneer and lumberman, Dennis Martin. Ecology Dennis Martin Creek and the other Corte Madera Creek tributaries and mainstem were historically Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) streams; however, access to the creek has been blocked since 1890 by Searsville Dam. In the spring of 1991, an adult steelhead (0.74m) was observed jumping at the base of Searsville Dam. According to local historian Dorothy Regnery's notes from her 1966 interview with Edgar H. Batchelder, who was 2 years old when his father became caretaker of Searsville dam in 1897, his \\"favorite place to fish for trout was in Dennis Martin Creek.\\" Watershed Dennis Martin Creek drains second growth Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest as it descends the northeastern slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. It traverses the Thornewood Open Space Preserve where it is met by an ephemeral stream that drains Schilling Lake. Shortly after crossing under Old La Honda Road the creek reaches the San Andreas Fault zone and crosses Portola Road where the ground becomes nearly level and it is one of a nexus of half a dozen creeks that coalesce in a large freshwater marsh to form Corte Madera Creek. Dennis Martin Creek flows into Sausal Creek just upstream of the reservoir area at the Family Farm Road bridge. From there Sausal Creek joins enters Searsville Reservoir. Old maps suggest that Dennis Martin Creek and Alambique Creek were tributary to Sausal Creek. Recreation Hiking trails are available in the 167 acre Thornewood Open Space Preserve, part of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District system, including the Bridal Trail and an easy walk to Lake Schilling along the wooded 3/4 mile Schilling Lake Trail. The preserve is accessed from the south side of La Honda Road (Highway 84), 1.6 miles past its intersection with Portola Road in Woodside.

It carries a significant amount of truck traffic to and from the industrial areas of north Edmonton and serves as a key commuter route for the bedroom communities of Stony Plain, Spruce Grove, and Sherwood Park, carrying nearly 80,000 vehicles per weekday in 2015. A suburban bypass of the route was completed when the northeast leg of Anthony Henday Drive (Highway 216) opened in late 2016, providing an alternate route through north Edmonton. The Yellowhead Trail designation begins at 231 Street, marking the western Edmonton city limit. The rural divided highway meets Anthony Henday Drive at a large interchange, crossing over the Canadian National Railway and veering slightly northeast through industrial areas of northwest Edmonton as the route becomes suburban and traffic levels increase. The expressway passes underneath St. Albert Trail and past Canadian National's Walker Yard to 97 Street. Bending south near the neighbourhood of Eastwood and back to the east, it intersects Wayne Gretzky Drive and Victoria Trail before descending across the North Saskatchewan River near Beverly to a second large interchange with Anthony Henday Drive, at which the Yellowhead Trail designation ends and Highway 16 enters Strathcona County. As a portion of the Yellowhead Highway, the expressway takes its name from the Yellowhead Pass, through which Highway 16 passes from Alberta into British Columbia. Construction was planned in the 1970s and was fully completed by 1984, receiving incremental improvements in subsequent decades; the route now includes a mix of signalized at-grade intersections and interchanges. Due to heavy congestion, Edmonton outlined a $1 billion plan in late 2016 to upgrade Yellowhead Trail to a freeway, eliminating at-grade intersections and constructing new interchanges. Work began in 2019 and is planned for completion in 2026. Yellowhead Trail westbound between 50 Street and 66 Street Route description Designated as Highway 16 in all four provinces it traverses, the Yellowhead Highway is an interprovincial route that runs from the Pacific coast of British Columbia through Alberta and Saskatchewan into Manitoba, ending in Winnipeg. It enters Alberta at Yellowhead Pass, travelling east into the Edmonton Capital Region as a four-lane rural divided highway that adopts the name \\"Yellowhead Trail\\" at 231 Street, marking the western Edmonton city limit. The first interchange within the city is a diamond interchange at Winterburn Road; the divided highway then meets the Anthony Henday Drive ring road at a large cloverstack interchange. Widening to six lanes, Yellowhead assumes the unsigned designation of northbound Highway 2 from Henday and passes underneath 184 Street and over the Canadian National Railway, veering slightly northeast into the Armstrong Industrial Area. It intersects 170 Street at another diamond interchange, then bends east past the Hawin Park Estate, and Dominion industrial areas of northwest Edmonton. After an interchange at 156 Street, the road meets 149 Street at-grade before curving east to an interchange at St. Albert Trail, which ends the concurrency and adopts the Highway 2 designation by carrying it north into St. Albert. East of St. Albert Trail, the expressway passes north of the Sherbrooke and Prince Charles neighbourhoods and intersects 127 and 121 Streets at-grade, running between Canadian National's Walker Yard and a large area formerly occupied by the Edmonton City Centre Airport. Following the railway corridor, it descends slightly to single-point urban interchanges at 97 and 82 Streets. At Elmwood Park the route curves southeast to intersect Wayne Gretzky Drive and Fort Road; the former is an expressway that proceeds south across the river toward downtown while the latter becomes Manning Drive and later Highway 15 to the north. Meanwhile, Yellowhead Trail crosses 66 Street at-grade prior to a diamond interchange at 50 Street. A freeway section ensues; the speed limit increases to as the road curves slightly southeast past Beacon Heights en route to an interchange at Victoria Trail before descending across the North Saskatchewan River near Beverly on the Clover Bar and Beverly Bridges, each three lanes wide. Climbing from the river valley, the expressway crosses into Strathcona County which officially ends the Yellowhead Trail designation immediately west of a second large cloverstack interchange with Anthony Henday Drive. Highway 16 continues past Sherwood Park toward Lloydminster at the Saskatchewan border. History Yellowhead Trail passing underneath Anthony Henday Drive in Strathcona County just east of Edmonton In the 1960s, Highway 16 followed portions of Stony Plain Road, Mayfield Road, 111 Avenue, 109 Street, and 118 Avenue through north Edmonton. The need for a free-flow bypass was identified, initially proposed when the City of Edmonton commissioned the 1963 Metro Edmonton Transportation Study (METS). The plan proposed a downtown freeway loop with feeder routes, including an eastern approach via 98 Avenue, a northeastern approach parallel to Fort Road, and a western approach, known as the Jasper Freeway, via the MacKinnon Ravine and 100 Avenue which would have directly connected with Highway 16 west. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Alberta expanded Highway 16 east of Edmonton, with connections to 98 Avenue in mind. A major interchange at Highway 16A (present-day Anthony Henday Drive) opened in 1971 and an interchange at Highway 16A and Highway 14X (present-day Anthony Henday Drive and Baseline Road, respectively) opened in 1975, featuring grading for a future eastbound to northbound flyover that was ultimately not constructed. The western freeway through the North Saskatchewan River valley and McKernan Ravine was the most controversial aspect of the plan, with public protests suspending construction shortly after clearing work had begun. In tandem with cost overruns, the project was cancelled in 1974. The cancellation of the METS freeway resulted in an alternate bypass route to be considered for Highway 16\\\\. At the time, 125 Avenue and Santa Rosa Road were collector roads which ran parallel to the Canadian National Railway; 125 Avenue was interrupted by the Edmonton Industrial Airport but the city had planned to connect the two segments to form an arterial roadway. In 1977, Alberta and Edmonton entered a cost-sharing agreement for the construction of Yellowhead Trail which included the expansion of 125 Avenue and Santa Rosa Road between 156 Street and 118 Avenue near the North Saskatchewan River, and a new extension westward to Highway 16X, which at the time entered Edmonton along 118 Avenue. Construction commenced in the late 1970s and was completed in 1984 with Yellowhead Trail as a 4-6 lane roadway. Interchanges opened at 118 Avenue / Victoria Trail in 1978, 97 Street and St. Albert Trail in 1982, and 170 Street in 1983. Following the completion of Yellowhead Trail, provincial highway designations were decommissioned within Edmonton's inner city; Highway 16 was designated to follow Yellowhead Trail east of 170 Street and Highway 2 followed Yellowhead Trail from St. Albert Trail to 170 Street before it continued south to Whitemud Drive and Calgary Trail. Yellowhead Trail was improved throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, firstly with interchanges opening at 82 Street in 1988 and later at Fort Road. A new Capilano Drive (now Wayne Gretzky Drive) extension opened in 1995, and interchanges opened at 50 Street in 1996, Anthony Henday Drive on the west side of the city 1998; and Winterburn Road in 1999. In 1997, Highway 16X was renumbered to Highway 16 resulting in Yellowhead Trail having a contiguous highway number for its entire length. Interchanges were opened at 184 Street in 2004 and 156 Street in 2007. Future Due to heavy traffic volume, much of which is large trucks, Edmonton sought funding to upgrade Highway 16 within the bounds of Anthony Henday Drive to a freeway. In 2016, the city unveiled plans for a $1 billion freeway upgrade to the expressway, eliminating at-grade intersections and constructing new interchanges. Design work is underway and construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in 2019 and be completed by 2026.

There is a famous ancient architecture called Hongmei Pavilion and that is why it is named Hongmei. History and development Hongmei Park was established in 1958 and was opened in 1960. The topography in this park is undulating and it is featured with rivers and lakes. In the park, there are Wenbi Tower and Hongmei Pavilion. They are all key cultural relics protection units in China. In addition, memorials such as Banshan Pavilion, Jiasha Tower, Bingmei Stone, and Wenbi Building can be visited there. Over several decades, Hongmei Park has become the largest comprehensive park in Changzhou district. Over 200,000 tourists at home and abroad come to visit this park every year. Hongmei Pavilion was built between Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty, dating back a thousand years of history. Now the Hongmei Pavilion is the reconstruction of the Qing dynasty. The whole building is stately, imposing and unsophisticated, rare to see in other pavilions in general. Each time when spring comes after winter, red plums are in full bloom. Visitors come in a continuous stream, appreciating the plum or overlooking the snow-covered landscape. Opposite the Hongmei Pavilion is the remains of a rare ice ages, Plum Stone. Zhao Yi,a famous Changzhou poet in Qing Dynasty, praised the beauty of Hongmei Pavilion through his poem.

Trump Signature Design. It is owned by The Trump Organization. Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles was formerly known as Ocean Trails Golf Club, an 18-hole course designed by Pete Dye, which was about to open when a landslide occurred and the 18th hole slid toward the Pacific Ocean. The Ocean Trails Golf Club subsequently went into bankruptcy, and on November 26, 2002 Trump bought the property for $27 million, intending to redesign the course. It includes a clubhouse. It is ranked among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play by Golf Magazine. The club is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island. It is not the only ocean-front golf course in LA County. Nearby is also the Los Verdes Golf Course. The course featured three artificial waterfalls until they were removed during the 2012‚Äì15 drought. The Michael Douglas Pro-Celebrity and Friends Golf Tournament takes place there annually, in April. At a total cost of $264 million, Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles would be the most expensive golf course ever constructed. Trump‚Äôs representatives claimed the course was worth $10 million in dealing with the L.A. County property tax assessor two years after the course opened. History Trump National's predecessor, the Ocean Trails Golf Club, was part of a property owned by developer Edward Zuckerman and a partner. Prior to the Zuckerman purchase, the property was used as a farm. The golf course is on the Palos Verdes Peninsula known for its landslides. The height of the peninsula of above sea level and the action of the waves are two main contributing factors for the landslides. The stratification of the sedimentary rock below the course is visible in the high cliffs of the area as it gradually slopes seaward. The sloping and stratification create favorable conditions for the generation of landslides. As a result, homes and roads have been lost to the ocean in that area. In the area occupied by the golf course and its vicinity, there are three ancient landslides which have been named by geologists as A, B and C respectively. The green of the Ocean Trails golf course 18th hole and half of its fairway were on top of ancient landslide C. On June 2, 1999 the construction on the $126 million Ocean Trails golf course was almost complete and the course was close to its scheduled opening when a landslide unexpectedly occurred, caused by the sudden reactivation of ancient landslide C, and of the 18th hole fairway disappeared under the ocean when a fissure parallel to the cliff appeared and subsequently collapsed. A long island was created due to the landslide, temporarily trapping a local resident. The landslide caused most of the 496 yard par 4 18th hole to slide toward the ocean, including the fairway and green. Also due to the slide, bike paths, walking paths, the edge of the bluffs and a segment of an LA County sewer line disappeared. It is believed that fluid discharge from the sewer line, probably leaking before the slide, acted as a lubricant on the thin underlying layer of bentonite, which became saturated with liquid sewage in turn, and this acted as a facilitator for the stratified geological accumulations to slide relative to each other. Bentonite, a form of clay, exhibits a low frictional coefficient when wet, i.e. it becomes slippery. The golf course opened with only 15 holes because of the landslide. The landslide caused the Ocean Trails Golf Course construction project to go into bankruptcy. Covered by insurance funds, a massive geotechnical project was launched to reconstruct the 18th hole using 1,250,000 cubic yards of earth to fill it. The stabilization work and the slide caused cosmetic damage to the course. At the time, golf course historian Geoff Shackelford said that at the then projected cost of repair of more than $20 million, the 18th hole would have been \\"the most expensive single hole in history\\". After three years, legal issues between the involved banks and developers caused the geological stabilization work to stop. In 2002 Donald Trump stepped in and bought the property, including the golf course, with the intention of finalizing construction and repairs by the summer of 2003. On January 20, 2006 the 18-hole Trump National Golf Club opened in Los Angeles. The reinforcement fill designed to stabilize the area affected by the slide is located under holes 17 and 18. During the massive geological stabilization process the golf course was open for business. The geological stabilization process was based on a geotechnical design involving the use of geosynthetic materials designed to enhance the cohesion and strength of the landslide fill. Asked about the safety of the work, Trump said: \\"If I'm ever in California for an earthquake, this is where I want to be standing\\". In 2008 Trump sued the city of Rancho Palos Verdes for $100 million, alleging that the city did not allow him to make the improvements needed to maintain the Trump image. The lawsuit was settled in 2012 for undisclosed terms. In 2015, the course was to have become the host of the PGA Grand Slam of Golf. The tournament was cancelled due to Trump's comments about illegal immigrants. Sports teams and charities continued to move their charity-golf tournaments to other venues during his presidency.

Researcher Kale Monk, an assistant professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Missouri, cites several reasons as to why a relationship might be on-again, off-again, including one partner relocating to a new place or the couple re-assessing their relationship. Many continue to reunite out of a persistent hope that the moments of happiness and gratification they have known will eventually constitute the entire relationship. Being in an on-again, off-again relationship can damage one's mental health, leading to possible depression, eating disorder, and/or anxiety. Additionally, Monk also notes how these types of relationships have higher rates of abuse, poorer communication, and lower levels of commitment. Not all on-again, off-again relationships are considered toxic, as breaking up and reconciling can help a couple with better communication and address the issues in their relationships. A 2009 study published in the Personal Relationships journal revealed that nearly two-thirds of participants have experienced being in an on-again, off-again relationship.

SAP AG, No. 4:07-cv-01658, is a United States District Court for the Northern District of California case in which Oracle sued SAP, alleging that SAP had engaged in copyright infringement by downloading thousands of copyrighted documents and programs from Oracle's Customer Connection website. SAP admitted that its subsidiary TomorrowNow had infringed Oracle's copyrights and a jury awarded Oracle record-high damages in the amount of $1.3 billion. Judge Phyllis Hamilton later vacated the jury's verdict, which was based on the calculation of a hypothetical license, and granted SAP's motion for a new trial dependent on Oracle rejecting a remittitur of $272 million. In November 2014, an appeals court ruled for $356.7 million in damages, a decision which was accepted by both parties.  Background  TomorrowNow was a company based in Bryan, Texas, which specialized in offering third-party technical service and support for enterprise software systems, including systems from PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. TomorrowNow was acquired by SAP AG in 2005 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of SAP. PeopleSoft acquired JD Edwards in 2003 and then Oracle Corporation acquired PeopleSoft in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California accusing SAP and TomorrowNow of corporate theft on a \\"grand scale\\". According to Oracle, TomorrowNow had downloaded thousands of documents and programs from Oracle's Customer Connection technical support website. Downloads were performed using credentials from Oracle customers whose support contract either already had or were about to expire. In addition, TomorrowNow had downloaded copyrighted support material for which the customers did not hold a license, and thus, were not authorized to access. Initially, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow had accessed Oracle's software and support documentation using customers' credentials, but claimed they were entitled to do so as TomorrowNow had been contracted by those customers to provide third- party support for their Oracle products. Later, Oracle and SAP agreed to limit the scope of the trial to solely the copyright infringement claim and the damages. SAP offered to admit that TomorrowNow had indeed infringed Oracle's copyrights, leaving the jury court to only determine the amount of damages. On the issue of damages, the two parties presented calculations that were vastly different. SAP claimed that Oracle had not suffered any losses and SAP/TomorrowNow had gained no financial benefit (rather they had lost $90 million) from the infringement. According to SAP's calculation, the damages were between $28 million and $408.7 million. Oracle based their damages calculation on the hypothetical price it would have cost a customer to purchase all the software and support in order to legally access all the material downloaded by TomorrowNow, totaling $2 billion.  Court ruling  On November 23, 2010, the jury awarded Oracle damages in the amount of $1.3 billion. This was the highest amount of damages ever awarded in a copyright infringement case. On July 13, 2011, SAP motioned for seeking judgment as a matter of law that actual damages should not be based on hypothetical licenses, and for a new trial for the amount of damages. On September 1, 2011, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton granted the judgment as a matter of law on the hypothetical license damages, and vacated the $1.3 billion award amount. In her ruling Judge Hamilton stated: SAP's motion for a new trial was granted, conditioned on Oracle rejecting a remittitur of $272 million, the \\"maximum amount of lost profits and infringer's profits sustainable by the proof.\\" Judge Hamilton further stated: = Hypothetical licenses = In of the Copyright Act, it states that \\"the copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement\\". Since the actual damages must be the result of the infringement, the burden is on the copyright holder to prove the connection between the monetary amount and the infringement. Oracle was required to prove that the two parties would have agreed on the hypothetical license and license fees, but Oracle had no such evidence. Oracle did not provide facts on previous licensing history or practices. Oracle also failed to provide evidence on benchmark licenses, such as negotiated licenses for comparable works. There was no evidence that Oracle would have licensed to SAP or if the two parties would have ever agreed to any license, so the hypothetical lost license fees could not be the award damages. Hypothetical lost license fees can be used to calculate actual damages, but they do not imply automatic entitlement of damages. Actual proof is required for objective, non-speculative lost license price. = Remittitur amount = During the jury trial, Paul Meyer, Oracle's damages expert, provided analysis that the hypothetical lost license fees were in the range from $881 million to $2.69 billion, and thus the jury verdict was for $1.3 billion. However, the \\"verdict grossly exceeded the actual harm to Oracle in the form of lost customers,\\" which was estimated by Mr. Meyer at either $408.7 million or $272 million, and estimated by SAP's damages expert at $28 million. The court rejected the $408.7 million figure from Mr. Meyer since it included \\"ongoing impact\\" through 2015, and that was not supported by the facts, since SAP ceased TomorrowNow's operations in 2008. The court also rejected the $28 million figure from SAP's expert, because it was based on inadmissible evidence. Therefore, the court set the remittitur at $272 million.  See also  * Oracle v.

It has unique properties that only occur, or occur most frequently, in a campus setting. Such phenomena as hooking up and lavaliering are widely prominent among university and college students. Hooking up is a worldwide phenomenon that involves two individuals having a sexual encounter without interest in commitment. Lavaliering is a \\"pre-engagement\\" engagement that is a tradition in the Greek life of college campuses. Since fraternities and sororities do not occur much outside of the United States, this occurs, for the most part, only in the US. Technology allows college students to take part in unique ways of finding more partners through social networking. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace allow students to make new friends, and potentially find their spouse. Date rape, violence, and sexual harassment also occur on college and university campuses. Victims of abuse come from every race and gender. Another potential form of harassment can be seen in professor‚Äìstudent relationships; even though the student may be of the age to consent, they might be coerced into sexual encounters due to the hope of boosting their grades or receiving a recommendation from the professor. History The practices of courtship in Western societies have changed dramatically in recent history. As late as the 1920s, it was considered unorthodox for a young couple to meet without familial supervision in a tightly controlled structure. Compared with the possibilities offered by modern communications technology and the relative freedom of young adults, today's dating scene is vastly different.Bailey, Beth L. \\"From Front Porch to Back Seat.\\" Johns Hopkins University Press. 25-56. The primary change in courtship rituals during this time was a shift from marriage to social status as the desired result. Before the 1920s, the primary reason for courting someone was to begin the path to marriage. It functioned as a way for each party's family to gauge the social status of the other. This was done in order to ensure a financially and socially compatible marriage. This form of courtship consisted of highly rigid rituals, including parlor visits and limited excursions. These meetings were all strictly surveyed, typically by the woman's family, in order to protect the reputations of all involved and limit such possibilities as pregnancy. This manner of courtship system was mostly used by the upper and middle classes from the eighteenth century through the Victorian period. The lower classes typically did not follow this system, focusing more on public meetings. However, the goal of the process was still focused on ending in a marriage. Around the 1920s, the landscape of courtship began to shift in favor of less formal, non-marriage focused rituals. The date, which had previously been the public courting method for the lower class, was adopted by young adults across the upper and middle classes. Meetings between lovers began to be more distant from rigid parental supervision. A young man might take a girl to a drive-in movie rather than spend an evening in the parlor with her family. While no two accounts of dating history completely agree on the timeline for this change, most do agree that new technologies were linked to its cause. Specifically, the advent of the telephone and the automobile and their subsequent integration into the mainstream culture are often identified as key factors in the rise of modern dating. Not only did these technologies allow for rapid communication between a couple, but they also removed familial supervision from the dating process. The automobile especially afforded a young couple the opportunity to have time together away from parental constraints. With the shift of courtship from the private to the public sphere, it took on a new goal; dating became a means to and indicator of popularity, especially in the collegiate environment. In this format, dating became about competing for the potential mate with the highest social payoff. On a campus in the late 1930s, a man's possession of a car or membership in a key fraternity might win him the attention of his female classmates. Women's status was more closely tied to how others perceived them. If they were seen with the right men and viewed as someone who was desired and dateable, they would achieve the desired social status.Waller, Willard. \\"The Rating and Dating Complex\\" American Sociological Review. 2.5:727-734 Hooking up It is common for college students to seek sexual encounters without the goal of establishing a long-term relationship, a practice commonly referred to as hooking up. Hooking up can have different meanings to different college students. For instance, at Howard University, the majority of students see hooking up as meeting friends or simply exchanging phone numbers without any sexual connotation to it. Hooking up is unique for when and why the sexual encounter occurs: instead of building a relationship before initiating sexual acts (from kissing to intercourse), hooking up allows the participants to become intimate without the expectation of commitment. Glenn and Marquardt's research shows the prominence of hooking up on modern-day college campuses; they found that approximately 40% of college women have participated in a hookup, with as many as 25% of that number having participated in this practice a minimum of six times. A majority of hookups occur when the participants have been drinking. It is often used to remove inhibitions and allow participants to use drunkenness as an excuse for a not commonly accepted behavior in society. It allows women to be more sexual than if they were sober, and can be the cause of the sudden increase in drinking at parties among teens recently. In countries other than the United States, other terms are associated with hooking up such as casual sex and short-term mating. A research study performed by Todd Shackelford, showed that short-term mating occurs in all 46 of the nations that he researched. It occurred least frequently in Poland, Ethiopia, and Congo; and it occurred most frequently in Lithuania, Croatia, and Italy. Lavaliering Lavaliering is a common practice among fraternity brothers and their girlfriends within the United States. When a brother decides that he wants to make his relationship more serious, he performs a secretive ritual with his brothers. The term lavalier originates from the name of the mistress, Louise de La Valli√®re, to the French king, Louis XIV. Lavaliering is a secretive ritual between the fraternity and the brother's girlfriend. The brother gives his girlfriend his letters or fraternity's insignia in order to label her as becoming a sexual possession to him. One young woman explains, \\"Several brothers came to my dorm room and blindfolded me....My blindfold was eventually removed, and I could see the room was filled with brothers all wearing their robes used for fraternity rituals. The only light was from lit candles around the room. At first I was a bit nervous, but then I saw my boyfriend and knew that everything was going to be alright.\\" Usually, after the ceremony is completed, the fraternity brother is berated for showing his loyalty to his girlfriend instead of the fraternity house. According to one account, the brother is tied to a bed post in the house, and \\"someone pours beer down his throat until he vomits. After he vomits, the girlfriend is supposed to kiss him.\\" Technology College dating, like many other forms of relationships, is being influenced by the application of new technologies. The most prominent among these technological advances is the rise in popularity of social networking and matchmaking sites such as DateMySchool, a website dedicated to college dating (established in 2010). These new technologies modify certain aspects of the current system of relationship formation, rather than fundamentally changing it. Participants in these services who are looking for a face-to-face relationship still tend to impose geographical and group-based limitations on the pool of potential mates. This indicates that, despite the increased number of possibilities, users still value the possibility of an offline relationship. Participants use the services in order to meet others who are outside their social circles, but still attempt to impose some limitations to maintain the possibility of a physical relationship. While the current literature on the specific effects of the advent of the internet on university-age dating is somewhat lacking and contradictory, there is agreement that it follows the trends of the general population. When students use the internet to find and create relationships, the most common bonds formed are on the level of friends and acquaintances. About ten percent of those interviewed reported one or more romantic relationships that had originated online. One prominent trend in this literature is the assertion that those with social/dating anxiety disorders are more likely to use online media to initiate relationships than those without those disorders. However, when this proposition was recently explicitly tested by Stevens and Morris, they found that the difference was not in the type of relationship sought, but in the methods used to seek it. They found that there is no significant difference in between those ranking high and low in risk for social or dating anxiety in the types of relationships that are formed through the internet. The difference lies in the fact that those with high anxiety indexes used webcams to communicate with people they had met and maintain their relationships. Stevens and Morris speculated that webcams allow for some of the benefits of face-to-face communication while retaining some of the buffering effects of cyber- communication, alleviating the social anxiety of the user. Date rape, sexual violence, and harassment Dating violence occurs in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships, and is defined as verbal, physical, psychological or sexual abuse to either gender. Approximately 35% of college students have been subjected to dating violence in a relationship, and the victims are often faced with self-blame, embarrassment, and fear of their perpetrator. Date rape is a common problem on college campuses; between 15 and 25 percent of college women experience date rape, and over fifty percent of college-aged men were sexually aggressive while on a first date. Date rape is most likely to occur in a student's first ten weeks of school, when they are more likely to trust others and may be engaging in social encounters outside of the mediating influence of their parents. Alcohol consumption has also been identified as a strong predictor of a woman's likelihood of being date raped at college. Alcohol consumption and sexual assault has been prevalent during fraternity parties, where victims are placed under social control and fear retaliation for speaking up against sexual violence. Sexual violence on campus can take on different forms. Physical abuse includes all forms of intending harm onto others: psychological, physical, and emotional. Sexual violence, however, only includes forcing oneself sexually onto another individual without consent, and encompasses both abuse and harassment. Both physical and sexual abuse on college campuses are becoming widespread problems that are on the rise. 33% of women have been physically or sexually abused by their partners before they turn eighteen, and 40% of individuals know someone who has been physically abused; the rates do not differ between heterosexual and homosexual relationships. Sexual harassment on campus can occur from authority figures, such as faculty members, or from the victim's peers in the college setting. Regardless as to where the abuse comes from, the end-effect usually leaves the victim feeling used. Harassment can occur from and towards either gender; however, males may face a second form of harassment when disclosing what has happened to them because they are going against cultural norms by reporting the attack. In an international study, including thirty-one countries, more women than men (twenty-four percent versus thirteen percent) had become physically abusive to their partner in the past year. When an authority figure harasses a student, the attacks are usually more severe than when another peer harasses a student, and over two-thirds of these attacks are targeted more at girls. Sexual harassment has not decreased, but thankfully 40% more victims are coming forward to report their cases. Since 1992, federal law in the U.S. has required that institutions of higher learning keep and report statistics on sexual assaults on campus. Colleges have also started education programs aimed at reducing the incidence of date and acquaintance rape. One priority is getting victims to report sexual assaults, since they are less likely to report one if it is an acquaintance. Professor-student relationships The phenomenon of student-teacher romantic and sexual relationships is one that is found across many types of school systems, age groups, and demographics.Sawyer, Thomas H. \\"Teacher-Student Sexual Harassment.\\" Journal of Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance. 72.5:10Mardsen, Harry. \\"Sex with Students: How some get away with it.\\" New York Times Educational Supplement June 25, 2004.\\"New York Teacher-Student Sex Crimes on the Rise\\" New York Times\\" June 20, 2007. However, in the collegiate setting, this phenomenon must be viewed differently. While the consequences and social problems of these relationships are relatively clear in elementary and secondary settings, the issue becomes more complicated in a university. The fact that the vast majority of college students are at or above the age of consent means that romantic relationships between faculty and students are not necessarily illegal. This differentiates the issue from concerns over such relationships in elementary and secondary schools.Alston, Kal. \\"Hands off Consensual Sex.\\" Academe. 84.5:32-33 The main concern about teacher-student romance in the university setting is largely one of potential conflicts of interest. If a student and a professor are in a relationship while the student is enrolled in that professor's class, there is the possibility that their relationship could create conflicts of interest. Besides the potential breach of classroom etiquette, there is also concern over grading impartiality. Another possible issue that since professors have so much power over their students (in matters of grading, recommendations, etc.), it is uncertain if the consent to sex by the student is valid and un-coerced.

Originally located on Los Angeles Avenue at Tapo Street, the depot opened in 1903. The Santa Susana Tunnel opened the next year, reducing the distance and transit time between Montalvo and Burbank on the Coast Route linking Los Angeles and San Francisco. Plans and construction for the building were based on Southern Pacific Railroad standard design Two Story Combination Depot No. 22. The depot served the community of Rancho Simi as a passenger station, telegraph office, and freight depot where farmers could deliver crops for shipping and pick up farming equipment delivered by the railroad. Due to lessening passenger traffic and changes in the shipment of freight, Southern Pacific closed the station in the early 1970s, leaving Santa Susana Depot empty and destined for demolition. The County of Ventura purchased the depot from the railroad for $1.06. In May 1975 the building was divided into three parts and moved by truck to county property two miles east of the site it was built on. The County of Ventura designated the building Landmark #29 in January, 1976.Cultural Heritage Board. \\"Ventura County Landmark Map\\" County of Ventura Planning Division Accessed 30 October 2013 Current status The current location is next to the same railroad right of way it once served. The building sat abandoned for several years suffering vandalism, and arson caused fire damage. A nonprofit organization was formed to restore the building and ready it for public use in conjunction with the Rancho Simi Parks and Recreation Department. The museum was opened to the public in 2000. The depot building now houses a railroad museum, an HO scale model railroad layout, and a public meeting room. The museum focuses on railroad history in the region and has many artifacts and historic photos on display. Along with the railroad related features, the museum also has a collection of materials related to the nearby Corriganville Movie Ranch. The railroad layout models the coast route between Los Angeles, California, and Portland, Oregon, with scenery that targets the early 1950s. The Santa Susana Railroad Historical Society designs, maintains, and operates the layout. Both the museum and the model layout are open on Saturdays and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. with the exception of holidays.

In the game, players direct a nascent space program, staffed and crewed by green humanoid aliens known as \\"Kerbals\\". The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers such as Hohmann transfer orbits and bi-elliptic transfer orbits. The first public version was released digitally on Squad's Kerbal Space Program storefront on 24 June 2011, and joined Steam's early access program on 20 March 2013. The game was released out of beta on 27 April 2015. Kerbal Space Program has support for user-created mods that add new features, and popular ones, such as those for resource mining and context-based missions, have received support and inclusion in the game by Squad. People and agencies in the space industry have taken an interest in the game, including NASA and the European Space Agency.https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Partnerships/Kerbal_includes_Ariane_5_and_real_ESA_missions_for_gamers In May 2017, Squad announced that the game was purchased by video game company Take-Two Interactive, who will help support Squad in keeping the console versions up-to-date alongside the personal computer versions. An Enhanced Edition was released on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in January 2018 by Private Division, a publishing subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive. Two expansions for the game have been released as downloadable content: Making History in March 2018 and Breaking Ground in May 2019. A sequel, Kerbal Space Program 2, has been announced for a 2021 release.  Gameplay  A rocket (preloaded ship \\"Kerbal X\\") sitting on the launchpad with the Vehicle Assembly Building and Mun, Kerbin's nearest moon, in the background. In-game Kerbals, female on the viewer's left, male on the right, standing on the launchpad The player administers a space program operated by Kerbals, a species of small green humanoids, who have constructed a fully furnished and functional spaceport called the Kerbal Space Center (KSC) on their home planet, Kerbin. Despite being shown as cartoonish beings sometimes lacking common sense, Kerbals have shown themselves capable of constructing complex spacecraft parts and performing experiments to realize their scientific goals. Players can create rockets, aircraft, spaceplanes, rovers, and other craft from a provided set of components. Once built, the craft can be launched by players from the KSC launch pad or runway, or other launch pads and runways around Kerbin, in an attempt to complete player-set or game-directed missions while avoiding partial or catastrophic failure (such as lack of fuel or structural failure). Players control their spacecraft in three dimensions with little assistance other than a stability system called \\"SAS\\" to keep their rocket oriented. Provided it maintains sufficient thrust and fuel, a spacecraft can enter orbit or even travel to other celestial bodies. To visualize vehicle trajectory, the player must switch into map mode; this displays the orbit or trajectory of the player vehicle, as well as the position and trajectory of other spacecraft and planetary bodies. These planets and other vehicles can be targeted to view information needed for rendezvous and docking, such as ascending and descending nodes, target direction, and relative velocity to the target. While in map mode, players can also access maneuver nodes to plan out trajectory changes in advance, which helps in accurately planning burns to other planets or celestial bodies. Missions (either player-set or assigned \\"contracts\\") involve goals such as reaching a certain altitude, escaping the atmosphere, reaching a stable orbit, landing on a certain planetary body, rescuing stranded Kerbals, capturing asteroids, and creating space stations and surface bases. Players may also set challenges for each other on the game's forums, such as visiting all five moons of Jool (the in-game analog for Jupiter), or use mods to test each other's spacecraft in air combat tournaments. Players can control in-game astronauts, known as Kerbals, who can perform extravehicular activities (EVA). While on EVA, Kerbals may use their EVA suit propellant system to maneuver in space and around craft and space stations, similar to the use of NASA's Manned Maneuvering Unit. Actions that can be performed while on EVA include repairing landing legs, wheels, and deploying or repacking parachutes. Kerbals can also collect material from science experiments, allowing them to store data inside the ship's capsule. During an EVA on any solid planet or moon, a Kerbal can place a flag or take a surface sample. Historical spacecraft can be recreated and their accomplishments mimicked, such as the Apollo program, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, or the International Space Station. Players may install mods which implement destinations, weapons, additional rocket parts, and goals, such as attempting challenges in a real-scale solar system. Mods can also add informational displays showing craft and orbital statistics such as delta-v and orbital inclination, while a few can near-fully automate flight. Some mods have been added into the game, due to popularity. For example, resource mining, in order to obtain Ore for refining into resources such as fuel, has been implemented from a popular mod. As of version 1.9.1, the major celestial bodies in the game in order of their proximity to the parent star, the Sun, are Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo (respectively analogs of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, and Pluto). Community modifications are able to expand this planetary system to include analogs of the missing outer planets, as well as fictional bodies and faraway exoplanet systems. Moons in the system include the captured asteroid around Eve, Gilly; the two moons of Kerbin, Mun and Minmus; The singular moon of Duna, Ike; the technically unlimited \\"moons\\" of Dres (albeit with player input), being asteroids which randomly spawn in, called the Drestroid Belt by fans; and the five moons of Jool. The innermost is an ocean moon dotted with sandy islands, Laythe, the only moon to have an atmosphere and only other body in the solar system to have liquid water besides Kerbin; Vall, an ice moon; Tylo, a moon the size of Kerbin; Bop, another captured asteroid; and Pol, the outermost moon of Jool. Eeloo has no natural satellites. = Game modes = The player starts a new game by choosing one of three game modes: sandbox, science, and career mode. In sandbox mode, players may attempt to construct a suitable vehicle for any desired project without penalties for failure and entirely user-assigned missions. Many players have constructed unrealistic spacecraft in this mode, such as impractically large, complicated, or expensive rockets. This mode is also frequently used to create replicas of real-life aircraft, rockets, trains, boats, cars, and other types of vehicles. In science mode, the initial selection of parts is limited. More complex parts can be unlocked in the Research and Development building by advancing \\"science\\" with various experiments on Kerbin and elsewhere throughout the solar system. This mode was designed to ease new players into the game and prevent them from getting overwhelmed. Career mode extends science mode by adding funds, reputation, and contracts. To build and launch new rockets, the players must complete contracts, earning funds to pay for the necessary parts. Reputation affects how many contracts are given to the player; less reputation leads to fewer, lower-quality contracts. Declining a contract will reduce the likelihood that a contract of the same type will appear later. Simultaneously, players must upgrade buildings in the space center to unlock new features such as improved tracking, higher spacecraft mass limit, larger part count limit, and increased available contracts.  Currencies  There are three currencies in Kerbal Space Program: Science, Credits or Funds, and Reputation. Although credits are the in-game analogs of money, Science and Reputation are referred to as currency as well. In Sandbox mode, no currencies are available, as there is no need for them. In Science mode, only science is available. All three currencies are available in Career mode. Science is gained by performing experiments or crew reports. The experiments can only be turned into Science through either transmissions via antennae, usage of specialized parts, or recovery of a craft on Kerbin. Recovery of an experiment is worth more science than transmitting it. Each time an experiment is turned into science, it is worth less science the next time it is recovered, until it is worth no Science at all. Funds, or credits, can be obtained in two ways: One; completing contracts by various agencies, and Two; by exploring new celestial bodies (in which a record-keeping society rewards the player with a few thousand funds). The Kerbin World Record-Keeping Society does have contracts; however, the rewards for exploring celestial bodies are not contracts. Contracts are accepted through the Mission Control building in KSC, and are completed during flight. Reputation is gained through successful missions, and lost through failed ones. It is essentially how safe Kerbals believe it is to fly on spacecraft. Generally, the better the space program's reputation, the better are the contracts received. = Physics = While the game is not a perfect simulation of reality, it has been praised for its accurate orbital mechanics; all objects in the game except the celestial bodies are simulated using Newtonian dynamics. For instance, rocket thrust is applied to a vehicle's frame based on the placement of force-generating elements, and joints between parts have limited strength, allowing vehicles to be torn apart by excessive or misdirected forces. The game simulates trajectories and orbits using patched conic approximation instead of a full n-body simulation; thus, it does not support Lagrange points, perturbations, Lissajous orbits, halo orbits or tidal forces. According to the developers, implementing full n-body physics would require the entire physics engine to be rewritten. The in-game astronauts, Kerbals, are physically simulated. Hitting an object with their feet will cause them to tumble. Some celestial bodies have atmospheres of varying heights and densities, affecting the impact of drag on wings and parachutes. The simulations are accurate enough that real-world techniques such as aerobraking are viable methods of navigating the solar system. Aerobraking, however, has become a much more difficult method of velocity reduction since the full 1.0 release due to improved aerodynamics and optional heating during atmospheric entry. In-game atmospheres thin out into space but have finite heights, unlike real atmospheres. Kerbal Space Program alters the scale of its solar system for gameplay purposes. For example, Kerbin (the game's analog of Earth) has a radius of only , approximately that of Earth's. To compensate for the gravitational consequences of this size difference, Kerbin's density is over 10 times that of Earth's. The planets themselves are also significantly closer together than the planets in the real-life solar system. However, some mods port the real-world solar system into the game with accurate scaling, environments, and additional parts to make up for the extra power requirements. = Expansions = There are two downloadable content (DLC) expansions: Making History and Breaking Ground. ;Making History The Making History, released March 2018, adds additional elements to the game, some of which are historic parts from the Apollo program. These include a lunar lander, basic rocket parts of the Saturn V and more. A level editor allows the players to create their own scenarios. New launch sites, including an island, are added. ;Breaking Ground Breaking Ground, released May 2019, adds robotic parts, which can be used to build helicopters, propeller airplanes, and robots. The parts include pistons, hinges and rotors. New suits were added as well. A major addition are surface features and science. The player can find certain rocks on surfaces of planets and analyse them using robotic arms. Science experiments such as active seismometers and weather stations can be deployed by the Kerbals and can be used to gather extra science points in science and career mode.  Development  = Pre- development = Director Felipe Falanghe was hired by Squad in April 2010. At the time, the company did not develop software. According to Falanghe, the name \\"Kerbal\\" came from the names he gave small tin figurines he installed in modified fireworks as a teenager. In October 2010, development on Kerbal Space Program was authorized by co-founder Adrian Goya but deferred until Falanghe had completed his projects. Kerbal Space Program was first compiled on 17 January 2011. The game's first public release, version 0.7.3, was on 24 June 2011. The game entered beta on 14 December 2014, with version 0.90, and was released out of beta on 27 April 2015. = Alpha = Version 0.7.3 was the first public release of Kerbal Space Program, and was released on 24 June 2011. It was downloaded over 5,000 times. Compared to future versions of this game, 0.7.3 was quite rudimentary. There was no stability assist mode, Kerbin did not rotate and the Sun was simply a directional light source. There were no fuel flow mechanics, no control surfaces, and no other celestial bodies. Later versions added additional planets and moons, as well as the ability to load and save collections of parts, known as \\"subassemblies\\". Tutorials were also added at this stage. Version 0.24, titled First Contract and released on 17 July 2014, added the contracts and reputation system to the game's career mode; however, players were still able to play career mode without these features in the new science mode. Contracts reward the player with currency and reputation. Funds can be used to purchase rocket parts, and reputation results in better and more lucrative contracts. The final alpha release, 0.25, included a new economic system, and a major rework of aircraft components. = Beta = Version 0.90, nicknamed Beta Than Ever, was released on 15 December 2014. This was the only beta update for Kerbal Space Program. Featuring extensively rewritten code for the editor, it introduced the ability to sort parts by several characteristics and to assign parts to custom categories. Players could now offset parts, including into space. Career mode featured building upgrades; only the creation of small rockets with low mass and a part count is initially supported, but the player can upgrade each of the facilities to increase size limitations or unlock other capabilities. = Release = Version 1.0 was the first full release of Kerbal Space Program. It was nicknamed We Have Liftoff! and released on 27 April 2015. Version 1.0 completely overhauled the flight and drag model for a more realistic simulation, now ignoring drag on rocket parts which were occluded from the air flow. It also allowed for body lift, so that parts that were not specifically designed as wings (such as structural panels) could still generate lift. 1.0 added shock heating and heat shields, making atmospheric entry much more dangerous, as well as air brakes and procedurally generated fairings. All parts received internal modeling. Resource mining was added to refine into fuel or monopropellant. 1.0 also brought several improvements to Kerbals, who could now have various specializations. For example, \\"Engineer\\" Kerbals can repair wheels and landing legs. Female Kerbals were also added to the game. Version 1.1, nicknamed Turbo Charged, was released on 19 April 2016, almost one year after the last major update. The game engine was upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5, resulting in a massive increase in performance, as well as a stable 64-bit client, removing memory constraints caused by too many mods being installed. Much of the game was rewritten to accomplish this. Squad released Version 1.2, nicknamed Loud And Clear, to upgrade the game from Unity 5 to 5.4 and introduce performance and minor gameplay improvements. The patch entered experimental testing on 6 September 2016 and was officially released on 11 October 2016. Its main new features include communication satellites, relay systems, and KerbNet. Several updates have been released since. = Other updates, Take-Two Interactive ownership = On 27 January 2014, it was revealed that Squad was working on an education-themed version of the game entitled KerbalEdu in collaboration with TeacherGaming LLC, creators of MinecraftEdu. It has since been released and includes an improved user interface for easier data gathering and summary, pre-made lessons that focus on certain constructions, options to use the metric system, and a \\"robust pedagogy\\" that includes information outside of the game that ties into its content. Squad has also made an Asteroid Mission Pack, with full support from NASA. Released on 1 April 2014, it is based on the real-life initiative to send humans out to study asteroids. The majority of the game's music was provided by royalty-free composer Kevin MacLeod, with the rest of the soundtrack having been written by Squad's in-house composer Victor Machado. The game's main theme was composed by lead designer Felipe Falanghe and arranged by Machado. On 5 June 2015, it was announced that Kerbal Space Program was being ported to the PlayStation 4 by Flying Tiger Entertainment. In August 2015, it was announced that Xbox One and Wii U ports were also in development by Flying Tiger Entertainment. The game has since been released on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but Squad has been quiet regarding the announced Wii U port. In January 2017, one of Squad's developers had finally broke the silence on the official forums, and admitted that despite initial enthusiasm to release the game on the Wii U, they claimed that various \\"external factors\\" has forced them to reevaluate supporting the console. They added that additional details will be announced at a later date. On 17 March 2017, Squad announced a full expansion for the game; called Making History, it would be paid and contain new features. These new features included Mission Builder, which would allow players to create and edit their missions that players could complete by launching and operating various rockets and ships in the game, and History Pack, which would provide designed missions simulating important historical space endeavors that have been completed in real life. Squad announced on 7 February 2018 that the expansion would be released on 13 March 2018. The expansion contains many parts inspired by those used in various rockets such as the Soyuz spacecraft and the Saturn V. Squad announced in May 2017 that Kerbal Space Program has been acquired by publisher Take-Two Interactive; this acquisition does not affect Squad's development or plans for the game and early backers will still get free DLC, and with Take-Two's help as a publisher, better support Kerbal Space Program on consoles to keep those versions to-date alongside the personal computer ones. Kerbal Space Program will be one of the first titles published under Take-Two Interactives's 2017-launched Private Division, a publishing label aimed to support mid-sized development studios. In late May 2019, Squad released the Breaking Ground expansion, which includes servos, pistons, redesigned space suits, and experiments which can be deployed to earn science over time.  Reception  The public alpha and beta releases were well-received. Many publications have spoken positively of the game, praising its replay value and creative aspects, including Kotaku, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, IGN, GameSpy, Eurogamer, Polygon, and Destructoid. In May 2015, PC Gamer awarded Kerbal Space Program 1.0 a score of 96 out of 100, their highest review score of 2015. They praised the \\"perfect blend of science and slapstick\\", as well as the sense of accomplishment felt upon reaching other planets and completing goals. IGN has praised Kerbal Space Program ability to create fun out of failure, saying that \\"By the time I finally built a rocket that achieved successful orbit, I had failed so many times that in almost any other game I would have given up completely.\\" In their review, Edge thought that \\"The magic of Kerbal Space Program is not just that it manages to be both a game and a simulation, a high-level educational tool and something that is fun to simply sit and tinker with. It's that, in combination, these qualities allow for a connection with real history and real human achievement... Its ultimate promise to the player is not that you'll crack a puzzle that has been set by a designer, but that you'll crack a puzzle set by reality.\\" = Commercial = In the hours after its Steam early access release on 20 March 2013, Kerbal Space Program was one of the platform's top 5 best-selling games, as well as the best seller on Steam for Linux. Squad has released physical merchandise such as clothing and plush toys. In March 2015, Squad and 3D printing service Eucl3D announced a partnership that would allow players to order 3D printed models of their craft. = Scientific community = The game has crossed over into the scientific community with scientists and members of the space industry displaying an interest in the game, including NASA, ESA, ULA's Tory Bruno, and SpaceX's Elon Musk. Squad has added a NASA-based Asteroid Redirect Mission pack to the game, allowing players to track and capture asteroids for mining and study. Squad has also developed an official mod for the game centered around observing and tracking threatening asteroids, named \\"Asteroid Day\\". The mod was developed in partnership with the B612 Foundation. Some parts from this mod outside of core functionality were added as part of the release of the 1.1 update, with full integration of the mod to stock game being the version 1.3.  Sequel  A sequel, Kerbal Space Program 2 is set to be released in late 2021.

His latest work The Cuckoo's Nest was published by Niyogi Books which is the story of Madam Agatha, a former devout nun who, after renouncing the order, decides to take up the cudgels for the cause of tolerance and pluralism. She decides to set up a unique institution called 'Nest' for empowering the hapless girls from all over the country, discarded by society. The paramount condition set by her is that none of the resident girls are allowed to talk of their religion or caste inside the campus. The novelist attempts to portray the kind of challenges she has to face from vested interests all around while working towards secularism, and how she manages to swim against the tide.

Two weeks later, on September 17, Soviet Union joined Germany in their attack on the Second Polish Republic. By early October, Poland was defeated. The occupied Poland was the only country in Europe where the Nazis had introduced a total ban on regional sports clubs. Football was allowed to be practised only by the Germans in the annexed areas of Upper Silesia. Polish activists and players risked their lives by organizing clandestine football competitions in Krak√≥w, Warsaw and Pozna≈Ñ. Following Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, Poland was split between the two occupiers. Eastern regions were annexed by Soviet Union's republics of Ukraine and Belarus, while western part was either directly annexed into Germany, or became General Government ‚Äì a separate region of the Greater German Reich. The region of Wilno was annexed by Lithuania. Because of the war, ongoing games of the 1939 season of Ekstraklasa were cancelled (if not outright abandoned), with Ruch Chorz√≥w being the top team (see 1939 Ekstraklasa). Furthermore, friendly games of Poland national football team with Yugoslavia and Romania, planned for September 1939, were also cancelled.  Football in Soviet- occupied Poland (1939 - 1941)  In 1939, only one of Ekstraklasa's ten teams was from the region which was later annexed by the Soviets. It was Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w, but in the city of Lw√≥w itself (which is the birthplace of Polish football), there was a number of other teams, such as Czarni Lw√≥w, Lechia Lw√≥w, Hasmonea Lw√≥w, and Ukraina Lw√≥w. Other well-known teams from Soviet-occupied Eastern Poland were Junak Drohobycz, Rewera Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, Kresy Tarnopol, Ognisko Pi≈Ñsk, Strzelec Janowa Dolina and WKS Grodno. Little is known about the fate of teams and players from other locations of Soviet occupied Poland, except from the city of Lw√≥w itself. Unlike German occupiers in Western Poland, the Soviets allowed selected Poles to play football. At the same time, however, all Polish teams were closed, and replaced with Soviet ones, which used the facilities of former Polish teams. Legendary coach Kazimierz G√≥rski, who spent his youth in Lw√≥w and before 1939 had played for RKS Lw√≥w, in the years 1940 - 1941 and 1944, put on the jersey of Soviet teams Spartak Lvov and Dynamo Lvov, before moving to Warsaw in 1945. Other famous players from Lw√≥w, who were allowed to compete in Soviet-sponsored teams, were popular goalkeeper Spirydion Alba≈Ñski and Wac≈Çaw Kuchar, who was coach of Dynamo Lvov (1939‚Äì1941, 1944‚Äì1945). Furthermore, Micha≈Ç Matyas (top scorer of 1935 Ekstraklasa), played for Dynamo Kyiv, and Adam Wolanin, after one year at Dynamo Lvov, moved to play shortly for Spartak Moscow, together with Boles≈Çaw Habowski, who played both for Dynamo Moscow and Spartak Moscow. Jan Wasiewicz ended up in Polish Armed Forces in the West, and Adolf Zimmer Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w was murdered in the Katy≈Ñ Massacre. Wac≈Çaw Jerzewski, who was Pogo≈Ñ's player and coach in 1938 - 1939, was after September 1939 interned in Romania, then fought in general W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders Corps, and returned to Poland after the war. Little is known about wartime matches of Polish teams from Eastern Poland. Bohdan Tuszy≈Ñski in his book Za cenƒô ≈ºycia (For the price of life) wrote that on July 2, 1944 in German-occupied Lw√≥w, a game between Polish team of the city and German team KONA took place. The Poles won 4-2. Currently, the memory of the teams from Lw√≥w (now: Lviv, Ukraine) is still vivid in Poland. Among teams which are regarded as successors of Pogo≈Ñ, there are Polonia Bytom, Odra Opole, and Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin, while Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, with its white-green hues, is a successor to Lechia Lw√≥w. Also, in autumn of 1946 in Lw√≥wek ≈ölƒÖski, sports club Czarni Lw√≥wek was founded, which owes its name to Czarni Lw√≥w. There were several other teams named Czarni in former German province Lower Silesia, where inhabitants of former southeastern Poland moved after the war - Czarni Jelcz- Laskowice, Czarni ≈ªaga≈Ñ and Czarni Otmuch√≥w. Very interesting is the story of players and officials of Junak Drohobycz, who became actively involved in Polish resistance movement. Before the war, Junak was a team sponsored by the Polish Army, and in late 1939, members of the club created the White Couriers - a boyscouting organization, which smuggled hundreds of persons from the area of Lwow to Hungary, across the newly created Soviet-Hungarian border in the Carpathians. One of the couriers was Stanis≈Çaw Gerula, goalkeeper of Junak. Most of players of Junak, who at the same time were soldiers, left Drohobycz in the night of September 11/12, 1939. A few days later they reached Hungary, where Colonel Mieczys≈Çaw Mlotek, manager of Junak, decided to recreate the team. Junak played several games both in Hungary, and Yugoslavia, among top players there were Antoni Komendo-Borowski (previously of Jagiellonia Bia≈Çystok and Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w) and Henryk Kidacki. In the second half of 1940, all players together with management moved to Tel Aviv, where several games were organized. In 1942, Junak, known as The Team of Polish Army in the East, was in Iraq. Among others, it beat Iraq 6-1 (January 29, 1943), and Iran 3-1 (March 12, 1942, with General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders watching the game). The Poles also faced the team of the British Army (with Harry Goslin, Stan Hanson, Don Howe and Ernie Forrest). The game took place in Baghdad. In late stages of the war, Junak, together with the army, moved to Italy. In 1944 in Naples, the Polish team, under the new name The Carpathians faced the team of Naples, with 35000 in attendance. Besides players from former clubs from Eastern Poland, the Carpathians also capped stars of Polish football from Upper Silesia, who had been drafted into the Wehrmacht, and were caught by the Allies or deserted in Western Europe - Edmund Giemsa, Ewald Cebula, Henryk Janduda of AKS Chorz√≥w, Zygmunt Kulawik of ≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice., In mid-October 1939, a little-known game took place in Starosielce in the suburbs of Bia≈Çystok. Soviet troops, which had entered the area a few weeks before, decided that there would be a football match between Polish team of Starosielce and a Red Army team from a unit stationed in nearby Choroszcz. After first half, despite several brutal fauls of Soviet players and partisan refereeing, the Poles were winning 2-0. During the break, an NKVD officer approached the manager of the Poles, telling him that Poles had to lose. Thus, the match ended in a 3-2 Soviet win.Musicie przegra√ß ten mecz  Football in Lithuanian-occupied city of Wilno (Vilnius) (1939 - 1940)  The city of Wilno was home to several teams, but only one, ≈ömig≈Çy Wilno played one season in the Ekstraklasa (see: 1938 Ekstraklasa). On September 19, 1939, Wilno was captured by the Soviets, who on October 26 handed it over to Lithuania. The Soviets returned in June 1940. Little is known about history of Polish football in Wilno during the war. The Lithuanians created their own teams, and players of ≈ömig≈Çy joined them. Defender Boles≈Çaw Zawieja played for LFLS Vilnius, forward J√≥zef Tumasz for LGSF Vilnius, goalkeeper Ludwik ≈Åo≈õ and defender Konstanty Paszkiewicz for JSO Vilnius. On June 16, 1940, as Gazeta Codzienna Polish language daily announced, a match between teams of Kaunas and Vilnius took place. Vilnius‚Äô team was almost exclusively made of Polish players of pre-1939 ≈ömig≈Çy, and Kaunas won 6-1. Longin Korwin-Paw≈Çowski, the only player of ≈ömig≈Çy who capped for Poland in 1937, ended up in a German POW camp, and after the war settled in Canada, where in 1968 - 1969 he was leader of Polish scouting.  Football in German-occupied Poland (1939 - 1945)  Following Polish September Campaign, the Germans occupied western and central Poland, the area where football was much better developed. Out of ten teams of the 1939 Ekstraklasa, only one came from Eastern Poland (Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w), and main centers of interbellum Polish football were located in Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and Polish part of Upper Silesia. German occupiers immediately banned all ethnic Poles from playing football, allowing only those who signed the Volksliste. As a result, all Polish clubs were closed, except for those from Upper Silesia, which were allowed to operate under new, German-sounding names. = Football in German-occupied Warsaw = In 1939, Warsaw had two teams in Ekstraklasa - Polonia Warszawa, and Warszawianka Warszawa. Immediately after capture of the city, the Germans closed all Polish clubs, and players were forced to go underground. In spring of 1940, first games were organized in Mokot√≥w Field by J√≥zef Ciszewski, former player of Cracovia and Legia Warsaw. Soon afterwards, in summer of 1940, regular games started, with prewar teams participating under changed names - e.g., players of Polonia Warszawa created teams of Pochodnia, Czarni, and Bimber. Before German authorities seized Polonia's stadium on Konwiktorska Street, in September 1940, a tournament with thirteen teams took place there. In the final game (September 13, 1940), Czarni beat Bimber 3-1. On December 24, 1941, Alfred Nowakowski created underground Warsaw District of Association Football, and in 1942 games of Warsaw Championship began, with teams not only from Warsaw, but from suburbs, such as Wo≈Çomin, G√≥ra Kalwaria, Brwin√≥w, and Piaseczno. Both in 1942 and 1943 champions were re-created Polonia Warszawa. Since matches attracted thousands of fans, and Warsaw was too dangerous because of presence of numerous German soldiers, most of them took place in the suburbs, in such towns, as Piaseczno, Konstancin- Jeziorna, B≈Çonie, and Mirk√≥w. In Piaseczno, on Easter Boxing Day 1943, a game between the teams of Warsaw and Krak√≥w took place, ending in a 1-1 draw, with hundreds of spectators watching. Also, in mid-1942, an unusual game took place in Legionowo. Huragan Wo≈Çomin faced a team made of German and Bulgarian soldiers, stationed in the town. Poles won 3-2, after a very heated match. Among most active football teams of occupied Warsaw was Okƒôcie Warszawa, which played over 100 matches. During the war, Okƒôcie kept four teams, including two of junior players. In 1942, Okƒôcie was second in Championship of Warsaw, after Polonia. Last wartime championship took place in 1944, but due to Warsaw Uprising, it was not finished. With some fifty teams, Warsaw was one of main centers of Polish football in those years, which was confirmed in the first postwar Polish Championship (1946), won by Polonia. = Football in German- occupied Krak√≥w = Krak√≥w was another center of Polish football - in 1939 Ekstraklasa, out of ten teams, as many as three (Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, Cracovia Krak√≥w, and Garbarnia Krak√≥w) were from that city. It took only a few weeks of occupation for local football officials and players to organize first underground wartime game. On October 22, 1939 in Bronowice, Wis≈Ça beat Krowodrza 3-1. On August 7, 1940, first wartime Championship of Krak√≥w began in Sports Park Juvenia. A few days earlier, on July 23, Hans Frank had issued a decree, which officially dissolved Polish associations, including sports clubs on the territory of General Government. However, Juvenia official Aleksander W√≥dka was allowed to use the grounds of the Sports Park in any way he liked, so football pitch there for two years was the arena of a number of matches, with German authorities giving unofficial permission. Eight teams participated in the 1940 Championship: Bloki, Cracovia, Garbarnia, Groble, Juvenia, Sparta, Wis≈Ça and Zwierzyniecki, and the champion was Wis≈Ça, winning all games, with goal difference 52-8. Second was Cracovia, third Garbarnia. The tournament was popular among local fans, attracting up to 3000 people for top games. Second Championship took place in summer and early fall of 1941 (between June 14, and October 19, with 79 games played). Poles were banned from practising organized sports, but at the same time, they were allowed to use Juvenia Parks‚Äô facilities, which gave them a chance to keep playing. There were no qualifiers for the Championship, and thirteen teams took place in it: AKS, Bloki, Cracovia, Dƒôbnicki, Garbarnia, Groble, Juvenia, Kazimierz, PrƒÖdniczanka, Sparta, Wawel, Wis≈Ça and Zwierzyniecki. After all rounds, it turned out that both Wis≈Ça and Cracovia had equal number of points, so additional game was necessary, which was won by Wis≈Ça 3-2. As organizers of the tournament later wrote, German soldiers and officers were frequent guests at games, but they did not disturb them. In 1942, after closing of Juvenia Sports Park, no championship took place, due to increased terror. The Championships of Krak√≥w returned in 1943, but this time they took place on several fields both in the city, and in the suburbs. Several new teams were created, and German authorities did not seem to be interested in these activities. After a July 6, 1943 meeting of officials, 22 teams applied for participation, and three groups were created. Games took place in suburban districts of Borek, ≈Åagiewniki, Rakowice and Wieczysta. The 1943 Championship of Krak√≥w was remembered for years because of events which took place during and after most games. Players, officials and supporters of teams would fight each other - on August 1, 1943, during a game between ≈Åagiewianka and Wis≈Ça, a group of ≈Åagiewianka officials and fans entered the pitch to beat up the referee and Wis≈Ça players. The game was ended eight minutes before time. A week later, there were disturbances during games Groble - Nadwi≈õlan (in Borek Fa≈Çƒôcki), and DƒÖbski - Czarni (in Rakowice), and Blue Police had to intervene. Due to those disturbances, on August 10, 1943, all games were cancelled. The decision was changed after the August 15 meeting, but it did not help, as soon afterwards, during the game Rakowiczanka - Cracovia, further riots took place. On Sunday, October 17, 1943, at 3 p.m., final game of the 1943 Krak√≥w Championship took place at Garbarnia Stadium, with some 10,000 spectators. The game between Wis≈Ça and Cracovia ended with a gigantic fight between supporters of both teams, after referee Tadeusz Milusi≈Ñski awarded a penalty kick to Cracovia, after Wis≈Ça's player touched the ball with a hand in the box. In response, Wis≈Ça's Mieczys≈Çaw Gracz kicked the referee, and Wis≈Ça's players left the pitch, urged by their officials. Fights between angry fans moved on to the streets of Krak√≥w's district of Podg√≥rze. German authorities did not intervene, as the military commandant of the district, Hans Mitschke, stated that \\"football fans were the same everywhere\\". As a result, the game was settled as 3-0 for Cracovia. The matches of the 1944 Championship of Krak√≥w were not fully completed, due to increasing terror of the occupation. = Football in German-occupied Upper Silesia = Unlike in other parts of Poland, German authorities in Upper Silesia allowed all teams to continue their activities, but they were ordered to change their names. Thus AKS Chorz√≥w became Fussball Verein Germania K√∂nigsh√ºtte, Ruch Chorz√≥w - Bismarckh√ºtter SV 99, Naprz√≥d Lipiny - TuS Lipine, and ≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice - TuS Schwientochlowitz (for more information see Gauliga Schlesien). In the late 1930s, bulk of players of National Team of Poland were from Upper Silesia; in some games there were eight Silesians in the starting lineup. Most popular football star of interwar Poland, Ernest Wilimowski, capped several times for Germany in the early 1940s, and other top players, from the region such as Gerard Wodarz, Jerzy Wostal, Teodor Peterek, Wilhelm G√≥ra, Leonard PiƒÖtek, Ewald Dytko, Erwin Nyc, after signing the Volksliste, were allowed to continue playing. Eventually, most of them were drafted to the Wehrmacht. Some time in early stages of the war, Leonard PiƒÖtek went to Krak√≥w, to ask J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa if he would let him and his colleagues play for German teams. Ka≈Çu≈ºa answered in the affirmative. = Football in other locations = Underground football games also took place in other locations of occupied Poland. * during the occupation of Bydgoszcz youth focused in particular districts unfolded enjoying great interest in football meetings. One of the initiators of these meetings was Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski (before the war striker in the juniors of Brda Bydgoszcz). Football teams existed in some neighborhoods of the city from which borrowed its name. In the \\"Wilczak\\" team played three Buhl brothers, player and at the same time the head of the team \\"PrƒÖdy\\" was Jan Dolata (before the war goalkeeper at OPN Sok√≥l V Bydgoszcz and KS Kabel Polski Bydgoszcz), in the eleven \\"Plac Ko≈õciuszki\\" played Jan ≈öwita≈Ça, and in the team, \\"Okole\\" outstanding player was Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski. * during the war, there were games of Championship of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. First underground Polish teams there were created in late 1939 and early 1940, among youth of districts of Widzew, Karolew, Ruda Pabianicka and Retkinia, also in towns of Zgierz and Pabianice. It has been established that in 1942, the final match between Cytadela and W√≥lka, was ended 10 minutes before time. Several Polish teams were active in the city during the occupation. According to the webpage of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Office of Polish Football Association, these were: W√≥lka, Wola, Wicher (which was made of players of ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫), Cytadela, Widzew, Zdrowie, Ruda, Chojny, Retkinia, Harcerze, Klapitka, Pabianice and Zgierz. Most active football team of wartime ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was Widzew, which played several games in that period, but the best team of wartime ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was W√≥lka. On October 24, 1943, the game between W√≥lka and Wicher was interrupted by German police. Many players and fans were arrested, and taken to a police station, but all were released after paying the ticket in the amount of 10 reichsmarks. * in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski, there were five teams: Huta (now Concordia), Bugaj - Zryw, Pekin - Ruch, Arba (former Zak≈Çad Sk√≥rzany). Since 1940, they played regular games, with lookouts scanning the area, as Germans tried to catch players. * in Rzesz√≥w, games of Resovia Rzesz√≥w were organized since 1942 in neighboring town of Strzyz√≥w, regarded as a safer location. Like in other places of the occupied country, players risked arrest, but their love of the game was more important. Among those who took part in those games were Edmund Bia≈Ças of Lech Pozna≈Ñ, who lived in Rzesz√≥w during the war, and Tadeusz Hogendorf, legendary player of Resovia and Warszawianka Warszawa. Hogendorf recalled later that Germans asked Poles to play against them. Matches took place somewhere near Dƒôbica, and Germans provided transportation for Polish players. * in Proszowice, on August 15, 1942, a game between local team Proszowianka and a team of players from Krak√≥w took place. Also, there was a game between Proszowianka and a team of German soldiers, stationed in the town. The match took place some time in fall of 1943, the Germans won 4-1. * in S≈Çomniki near Krak√≥w, local team S≈Çomniczanka continued its activity, with German commandant of the town unofficially allowing matches. During the war, there were several games vs. teams from Krak√≥w, also vs. a team of Wehrmacht soldiers. Furthermore, S≈Çomniczanka hosted teams from local towns - Wolbrom, Kazimierza Wielka, Ska≈Ça, Proszowice, Miech√≥w, Nowe Brzesko, Pilica. * football games also took place in the region of Zag≈Çƒôbie DƒÖbrowskie. Several teams were active there - from Sosnowiec (Unia Sosnowiec), Czelad≈∫, DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza, Bƒôdzin, districts of Niwka, Zag√≥rze, and Piaski. Some time in the early 1940s, underground championship of the region took place, won by AKS Niwka. * in Siedlce, where several unofficial teams were active during the war (Mydlarze, Goryle, Kolejarze, Czarni), a game between Polish side of the city and a team of Wehrmacht took place in 1940. The game was won by the Poles, and several Polish players had to hide for some time, fearing arrest by angry Germans. * in Jƒôdrzej√≥w, in the years 1941 - 1942, there were games between local team and teams of Kielce and Wolbrom. For fear of Germans, these matches took place on a meadow in the neighboring village of Piaski. * games also took place in Sandomierz. According to the webpage of Town Center of Sports and Recreation, during a break in a secret game, partisans of Jƒôdrusie executed a local Nazi official.Miejski Stadion Sportowy - historia i plany po modernizacji obiektu\\"W czasie okupacji hitlerowskiej w przerwie meczu pi≈Çki no≈ºnej - partyzanci z grupy \\"Jƒôdrusie\\" wykonali wyrok na przedstawicielu hitlerowskich w≈Çadz miasta Sandomierza\\" * even though German authorities expelled thousands of Polish inhabitants of Gdynia, and named the city Gotenhafen (see Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany), remaining officials and players of Ba≈Çtyk Gdynia organized games, which took place in Rumia - Zag√≥rze, with a number of people watching. * in Gr√≥jec, two games were organized in 1941. During the second match, the Germans organized a roundup, arresting nine people. After that incident, no more games took place in the town. * games for the championship of the city were organized in Lublin, with such teams, as Promie≈Ñ, Kolejarz, Bronowiczanka, Unia, Garbarnia, Rurowianka, Wrotkowia, KS Lublinianka and Star√≥wka. Lublin players twice went on bicycles to Dƒôblin, to play a local team. Last wartime championship of the city was won by Unia. In August 1944, when the Wehrmacht had already been pushed behind the Vistula, a game between team of Lublin and team of Italian POW's, released from camps, took place. With thousands of fans and Red Army officers watching, the Poles won 2-1. * since Tarn√≥w was too dangerous, players of Tarnovia Tarn√≥w and other local teams organized matches in such towns, as Ciƒô≈ºkowice, Bobowa, Limanowa, and Krzy≈º.History of Football Department of MKS Tarnovia * in Jas≈Ço, the Germans seized stadium of Czarni, so local players were forced to play in neighboring villages, such as Mƒôcinka. Also, a game between Jas≈Ço and Strzy≈º√≥w took place in Strzy≈º√≥w, with the guests winning 5-3. Underground matches also were organized in the towns of Krosno, Lesko, and Sanok, mostly on meadows.30 Years of Krosno Office of Polish Football Federation * German occupiers forced a number of inhabitants of Czechowice-Dziedzice to move to Bavaria, especially to the town of Kirchenlamitz, where they worked in local factories. Several illegal games took place in Kirchenlamitz, between players of prewar local rivals RKS Czechowice and SKS Gra≈ºyna Dziedzice. In the same town, an unusual game between Polish and French workers was organized, won by Poles 4-2.

The explosion demolished as many as forty houses, and left dozens of others badly damaged. The explosion claimed the lives of 126 people and inflicted countless injuries. The accidental explosion is the worst disaster of the kind to have occurred in Ireland. In the long run, however, the disaster provided the impetus for the expansion of Dublin in the early 17th Century and beyond, with the rebuilding efforts laying the foundation of the new city centre.  Explosion of 11 March  In the early afternoon of Friday, 11 March 1597, a consignment of gunpowder barrels was being unloaded by crane from a lighter (a barge) moored at the dock close to Wood Quay. Shortly after one o'clock, as the wooden crane was shifting four barrels of gunpowder towards the quay, 140 barrels of gunpowder that had been resting on the river side were engulfed by a massive explosion, transforming the quayside into a scene of devastation. The crane and crane house, which were sited by the barrels, were torn asunder, and the force of the blast was felt far across the city. Nearby, many houses owned by merchant families facing the River Liffey were consumed by the blast, some of them collapsing, others badly defaced. Such was the force of the blast that some buildings in the suburbs of the city were damaged as debris rained down across Dublin. The dozens of riverside labourers who were unlucky enough to be working in the area had no chance of survival: body parts were found scattered hundreds of yards from the crater left by the explosion. The contemporaneous Gaelic chronicle known as the Annals of the Four Masters describes the disaster: > :...a spark of fire got into the powder; but from whence that spark > proceeded, whether from the heavens or from the earth beneath, is not known; > howbeit, the barrels burst into one blazing flame and rapid conflagration, > which raised into the air, from their solid foundations and supporting > posts, the stone mansions and wooden houses of the street, so that the long > beam, the enormous stone, and the man in his corporal shape, were sent > whirling into the air over the town by the explosion of this powerful > powder; and it is impossible to enumerate, reckon, or describe the number of > honourable persons, of tradesmen of every class, of women and maidens, and > of the sons of gentlemen, who had come from all parts of Ireland to be > educated in the city, that were destroyed.  Lead-up to explosion  The disaster took place against the backdrop of the Nine Years' War, in which the Ulster leader Hugh O'Neill and his allies were engaged in an armed challenge to the English Crown. Vast quantities of gunpowder were required to supply the English army in Ireland. The main destination for the cargo of gunpowder was Dublin, the principal city of Ireland. These were offloaded by English ships onto boats waiting offshore: from there, they were ferried across the shallow water to the city. In the days before the explosion, a dispute had arisen between the Dublin porters and the castle officials. A crown official by the name of John Allen, the clerk of the storehouse, had threatened and intimidated a number of the porters, forcing them to work without pay. As such, many of the porters were effectively on strike, refusing to help unload the barrels of gunpowder. This led to a buildup of gunpowder on the quays. This series of events set into motion the explosion which was to follow. Exactly what triggered the conflagration of the barrels was never determined, although the day of the explosion was noted as unusually dry. Given the circumstances, an accidental ignition in one of the barrels was not improbable.  Aftermath: Dublin rebuilt  John Speed's 1610 map of Dublin (from surveys taken c.10 years after the explosion). The explosion occurred at Wood Quay, marked with the number 8 on Speed's map The disaster claimed 126 lives, both men and women, and mostly locals. At the time, the population of Dublin was not quite 10,000, so the impact of the death toll was significant, representing over 1% of the population of the city. Although the immediate impact of the explosion was horrific, the rebuilding that took place in the early 17th century paved the way for the dramatic expansion of Dublin in the 1600s. In contrast to the timber that was widely employed in Ireland in the Medieval and Tudor era, much of the new building was in brick. The rebuilding effort also spilled into newly reclaimed land in the east of the city. This facilitated the dramatic growth of the population of the city, from less than 10,000 in 1600 to around 20,000 by the 1630s. The rebuilding effort was in some respects comparable to that which took place in London after the Great Fire of 1666, transforming medieval Dublin into a more modern city.

Allen, Sr. (May 13, 1900 - August 1983), was a member of the California State Assembly in the 1940s and 1950s and of the Los Angeles City Council between 1947 and 1956. Biography Allen was born on May 13, 1900 or 1907, in Atlantic, Iowa, the son of Thomas Allen of Missouri and Lillian M. Allen of Potosi, Wisconsin. He attended public schools in Iowa and Nebraska, where he studied civil engineering, and completed courses in engineering science and war training at the University of Southern California and Caltech. He was married to Margaret Sachs or Margaret H. Rogers of Detmold, Germany; they had a son, Don A. Allen, Jr. Both Allens were in the U.S. Marines, the elder serving in the Haitian campaign of 1927 against the Sandino Rebellion.Los Angeles Public Library reference file JoinCalifornia website, citing other sources Allen was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Elks Lodge, Rotary and the United Commercial Travelers. He attended McCarty Memorial Christian Church. He died in August 1983 in Oceanside, California. Public service In the 1920s he was an investigator for Los Angeles County District Attorney Thomas Woolwine. =State Assembly= Allen was elected to the State Assembly in 1938 and was reelected in 1940, 1942 and 1944. He was a member of the State Council of Defense and the State War Council. He resigned on June 20, 1947, to assume the duties of a Los Angeles City Council member. In June 1956 he was reelected to the Assembly in a special election but instead remained on the council and declined to serve in the Assembly until after the regular election in November 1958. The Legislature did not meet until 1959, when he took his seat. Allen was the author of The Source Book on the California Legislature, published in 1965, and as a result the entire Legislature named him \\"California Legislative Historian for Life.\\" =City Council= Elections See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1947 and following. Allen was elected to represent Los Angeles City Council District 7 in 1947, defeating the incumbent, Carl C. Rasmussen. He was reelected in 1949, 1951, 1953 and 1955. Between 1937 and 1956 the district was bounded on the west by Crenshaw Boulevard, on the north by Exposition Boulevard, on the east by the city boundary with Vernon and on the south by Vernon Avenue.\\"New Council Zones Defined,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 7, 1937, page A-18\\"Proposed New Alignment for City Voting Precincts\\" (with map), Los Angeles Times, November 30, 1940, page A-3 In 1947 it was noted that the district's population was \\"nearly 50 per cent Negro.\\"\\"Voters to Decide Issues Tuesday,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 25, 1947, page A-2 In 1957, after Allen's resignation, the district was moved bodily to the San Fernando Valley.\\"Council Votes Redistricting After Flare-up Over Changes,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 24, 1956, page B-1 Positions Voting machines, 1948.

This has included allegations of conflict of interest, voting irregularities and overcharging, product placement for sponsors, staging scenes, use of pitch correction technology, and exploiting vulnerable contestants. The series has also been criticised for developing singers as marketable products rather than creative individuals. As of April 2020, there have been a total of fifteen completed series of the show broadcast on the ITV network, as well as spin-offs The X Factor: Celebrity (2019) and The X Factor: The Band (2019). Judges and presenters Louis Walsh was accused of helping contestants he had personal connections with in both the first and second series. Sharon Osbourne was accused of voting against Simon Cowell's contestants in a pact with Walsh. It was reported in tabloid newspapers that the show's audition process was unfair after judge Louis Walsh was accused of cheating. Walsh was thought to have advised group Co-Ed on things such as song choices, which caused controversy after it was revealed that Walsh had previously managed the band after they appeared on the Irish version of Popstars in 2001. Around the same time footage of Simon Cowell and Sharon Osbourne coaching contestants to argue back to the judges was being sold to the highest bidder. Prior to the first live show, Cowell was accused by Osbourne of \\"rigging\\" the show by editing footage to make his contestants more appealing to viewers. In December 2004, Osborne made an apology after attracting what Cowell referred to as \\"record complaints\\" over an outburst in which she criticised eventual winner Steve Brookstein. This left her place on the show uncertain. During the live stages of the second series, Osbourne and Walsh were accused of having a pact against Cowell, that resulted in them unfairly eliminating his contestants against their own. Further controversy was created when Walsh cast the deciding vote to keep Irish group The Conway Sisters in the show at the expense of Maria Lawson. The controversy heightened when it was revealed that he had worked with The Conway Sisters prior to them entering the show. On one occasion, Walsh announced after the live Saturday show that he would quit the series, claiming that the other two judges had been \\"bullying\\" him. In addition to various verbal assaults on Walsh, Osbourne had thrown water over him live on air. Walsh's announcement was claimed by many to be a publicity stunt after he decided to return to the show the following Saturday night. Prior to the commencement of series four, The Xtra Factor host Ben Shephard left his post after reportedly being unhappy about not being given the presenting role on the main show, which instead went to Dermot O'Leary following the departure of original host Kate Thornton. During a live broadcast in series five judge Dannii Minogue broke down in tears after Walsh accused her of \\"stealing\\" the song \\"Rule the World\\" that he had wanted for JLS. The song choice selection process took place off camera and was done on a rota system, which alternated first priority when requesting songs. Cowell defended Minogue and convinced Walsh to apologise. Later on the ITV2 broadcast of The Xtra Factor, Cowell once again defended Minogue's actions, commenting \\"Dannii did exactly what I would do, which is choose the right song for the artist and if Louis doesn't like it, tough!\\" During the first live show of sixth series, Minogue caused controversy after commenting on press reports surrounding openly bisexual contestant Danyl Johnson's sexuality that caused an online backlash. She subsequently apologised, which was accepted by Johnson. During the same series, Cowell was criticised for allegedly pressuring fellow judge Cheryl Cole to cast her elimination vote against contestant Lucie Jones who he could then save. Jones, widely considered the better singer, was subsequently eliminated from the competition by viewer poll. Dannii Minogue later said \\"This is a singing competition ... and this shouldn't have happened\\". During week five of the seventh series, two of Cheryl's acts, Katie Waissel and Treyc Cohen, were in the bottom two. According to the rules of the competition each judge must independently vote to eliminate one of the contestants. However, Cheryl refused to vote against either of them, causing presenter Dermot O'Leary to remind her of her duty as a judge. Cohen was eventually sent home on a majority vote of the remaining three judges. Contestants During series three, boy band Avenue were accused of cheating after it emerged that they already had a management deal with music mogul Ashley Tabor-King, who reportedly sought to use the show for publicity. It was also revealed that one member, Jamie Tinker, previously had a recording contract with a branch Sony Music Entertainment, of which Cowell's company Syco is a subsidiary. Despite attracting criticism, this was judged not to be against the rules of the show. The band insisted that they were not cheats. During series four, the producers discovered that Sisi Jghalef, a member of girl group Hope, had a criminal conviction. Having an unspent criminal conviction is in contravention of the show's rules, and Jghalef was asked to leave the competition. Hope, who had already been selected as finalists, continued without her. During the live stages, 15-year-old contestant Emily Nakanda was discovered in a \\"happy slapping\\" video, in which she apparently attacked another girl. Both her mentor, Sharon Osbourne, and her family were said to be upset with her behaviour. Nakanda chose to withdraw from the competition of her own accord rather than being asked to do so by producers. The lowering of the minimum contestant age from 16 to 14 for series four attracted criticism from some quarters. Groups such as the Family and Parenting Institute expressed concern that children of this age might be not be sufficiently emotionally robust to cope with the experience. The minimum age was returned to 16 for series six and again lowered to 14 for series eleven. After the second audition episode of series five had been broadcast, Cowell publicly stated his intention to make changes to the show by reducing the emphasis on contestants' \\"sob stories\\", conceding that they had been \\"out of hand\\" in the previous series and viewers were \\"starting not to believe them\\". Contestant Alan Turner was criticised in the press for allegedly lying to the judges in his original audition. Turner had told the panel that he had been fostered and sexually abused since the age of four and did not know his real parents, but his father and uncle publicly disputed the claims. Producers vowed to support Turner, who had been put through to boot camp, insisting that his place on the show was \\"never in jeopardy\\". Turner claimed that the show's editing had made him appear dishonest, but his mother later claimed that her son had made false claims which had \\"hurt [her] beyond belief\\". In one episode, Cowell confronted Turner over the truth of his story, and was satisfied that it was. Ultimately, however, Turner was eliminated at the final stage before the live shows. Series seven auditionee Shirlena Johnson was removed from the competition after the boot-camp stage over concerns about her mental health. In Johnson's first audition, she performed \\"Mercy\\" by Duffy, but she performed it so incoherently that the song became almost unrecognizable. The producers stated that they had had only received information about her mental health on 23 August, but Johnson's mother stated that they already knew about her medical history. A spokesperson for the show said \\"the welfare of contestants is of paramount importance, and for this reason, it has been agreed that Shirlena Johnson should not continue in the competition.\\" Zimbabwean singer Gamu Nhengu progressed to the judges' houses stage under Cheryl's mentorship. Viewers expressed anger when Cheryl did not pick Nhengu for the live shows, despite a well received performance. Instead, Katie Waissel and Cher Lloyd were chosen, despite both being unable to finish their performances. Cheryl defended her decision as a \\"gut instinct\\" that she thought was best. Waissel's inclusion in the show was further surrounded by controversy as it was revealed that she already had a recording contract in the United States prior to auditioning. In series eight, contestant Ceri Rees was reportedly persuaded to return to the show by the producers. Several well-known celebrities condemned the show for broadcasting her audition. Mind, a charity that aids people with mental health issues, publicly condemned the decision with a spokesperson saying \\"We want people with mental health problems to participate, but need program-makers to be responsible\\". During the live shows, Frankie Cocozza was asked to leave the competition for boasting about using cocaine. The rules of the series strictly prohibit drug use during the show. Midway through the series, girl group Rhythmix were forced to change their name after an attempt by Cowell to trademark the name came to the attention of the music charity organisation Rhythmix. The charity's chief executive, Mark Davyd, wrote an open letter to Cowell telling him to \\"just change the name\\". Following public pressure from the charity, the group agreed to change their name to Little Mix, and later won the series. In series nine, Christopher Maloney received much criticism. He was eliminated at the judges' houses but returned to the competition in a wildcard vote and subsequently received the most public votes for several weeks. Newspapers reported that this was an apparent effort by viewers to destroy the show's credibility beyond repair. Maloney was regularly attacked verbally by the judges, who did not see him having the superstar quality to justify his place in the competition. Maloney reached the finals but polled the lowest number of votes at the first stage and finished in third place. The following day, reports surfaced that he was kept from performing that night's final group song after reportedly turning up late for rehearsals, having drunk alcohol the previous night and was still smelling of it, and allegedly used misogynistic language toward another contestant. Series ten contestant Lydia Lucy criticised the new boot-camp format that was introduced in this series, in which successful contestants were at risk of losing their place if another contestant was deemed to have performed better. Lucy was one of three contestants who lost the support of her mentoring judge Nicole Scherzinger in favour of another contestant in this challenge. She said: \\"I've been absolutely devastated ... [this] is like dangling a carrot in front of someone and then taking it away.\\" Scherzinger was criticised for eliminating returning contestants Jade Richards and Melanie McCabe at the judges' houses stage. McCabe's exit was met with outrage on Twitter, as she had been considered one of the favorites to win the series. In interviews given shortly before judges' houses was screened, both contestants had vowed never to return again if they were rejected. In June 2020, series eight contestant Misha B took to social media to open up about accounts of racism she experienced while on the programme. She stated: \\"They saw an opportunity to tear down a black girl that came from a broken home and worked together to assassinate my character and to sabotage my career by orchestrating lies\\", and added that she was suicidal and was diagnosed with PTSD after the competition. She cited judges Tulisa and Louis Walsh having a \\"corrupted agenda\\", with the pair making remarks on live television about Misha B being a bully. Judge Gary Barlow backed up her claims, stating: \\"About half an hour before the show goes live, the producers would come in and they‚Äôd go 'Oh my god. That Misha. She‚Äôs such a bully. Can‚Äôt believe it. She is such a bully. In fact, you know what? You should say it. You should say it on air. She‚Äôs just bullied everyone all week'.\\" Tulisa responded to her claims, saying that she regrets her words and apologised, but commented that \\"to say and make claims that it was racially motivated is ludicrous\\", and added that \\"accumulation of things that Misha had done to other contestants\\". Auditions Simon Cowell and Cheryl filming the auditions for series seven, where voice manipulating technology was used. There is anecdotal evidence from blogs and discussion forums that some of the first-round X Factor audition sessions held in front of the producers have been poorly organised, with auditions forced to wait for many hours outside in the cold with few facilities and little information about when they will be seen. Attendees have also complained about queue-jumping, exorbitantly priced refreshments, the very short period of audition time permitted, and the fact that selection decisions are left in the hands of unqualified production staff. It has been alleged that some of the \\"open\\" audition events are simply an opportunity for producers to get shots of large crowds, rather than a serious attempt to find talented contestants.Get Ready For The Manchester X Factor Open Auditions ‚Äì 18 June 2006 X Factor Blog Auditionees are reprimanded by production staff if they complain or fail to participate in such shots. The production team also supply the \\"home-made\\" signs ('I have the X Factor', etc.) that the contestants brandish. According to the Daily Mirror and several other newspapers, the auditions for series seven have involved the use of pitch correction to make some singers sound \\"better\\" than they actually were. ITV did admit to doing this, but claimed that it was done in post-production and that the contestants did not know that their voices had been altered. This came about after viewers noticed the difference in singing by Gamu Nhengu in her audition. Accusations of staging Rhydian Roberts complained he was \\"stitched up\\" by unfair editing. There have been suggestions that much of the controversy surrounding the show, such as the bickering between the judges, is deliberately orchestrated to attract publicity, and that some supposedly \\"spontaneous\\" scenes are rehearsed or reran. Series one runners-up G4 branded The X Factor as a pantomime due to staged conflict between the judges which overshadowed the contestants' performances. Several contestants have alleged that they were manipulated by the show's producers. Series five finalist Rachel Hylton claimed that she was \\"set up\\" and \\"exploited\\" by the show. During the first live results show of the ninth series, executive producer Richard Holloway was accused of interfering with the judging process after he was seen speaking to Walsh during Carolynne Poole's final showdown performance. Walsh appeared to struggle with the decision, at first declaring that he wanted to save Poole, but when pressed by presenter Dermot O'Leary to name who he wanted to eliminate, he then said he wanted to send the result to deadlock by voting to eliminate Poole, which resulted in boos from the studio audience and anger expressed by online viewers. Former contestant Frankie Cocozza criticised the show on Twitter, writing that \\"The X Factor just showed the whole country how set up it is, not that we didn't know that anyway. The producers fucked it.\\" Voting irregularities In October 2007 (series four), it emerged that \\"serious technical issues\\" had resulted in viewer votes being ignored in the series four final, though it was found that the problems did not \\"alter the actual outcome\\" of the vote. ITV put in place a scheme which allowed affected consumers to be offered refunds. After series three, it was discovered that ITV had overcharged viewers who voted via interactive television by a total of approximately ¬£200,000. ITV said a data inputting error was to blame and that they would refund those affected on production of a telephone bill. They also indicated that they would make a ¬£200,000 donation to Childline. This error, and those by other broadcasters, eventually led to a temporary suspension of all ITV's phone-in services on 5 March 2007 pending an audit and meeting with ICSTIS. Over 1,100 people complained that there were irregularities with the voting in the final of series four, won by Leon Jackson, leading to a statement from ITV. Following the result of the series four final, which was won by Leon Jackson, media watchdog Ofcom received a number of complaints from viewers who said that they were unable to register their vote for Rhydian Roberts, despite trying up to ten times.\\"Watchdog looks into X Factor vote\\", BBC News, 17 December 2007, retrieved 17 December 2007 -- Many fans believe that the contest was somehow rigged to the benefit of Jackson. Though unproven, there were \\"apparently\\" thousands of votes that were not properly counted. After complaints topped 1,100, ITV issued a statement which assured viewers that \\"Leon won The X Factor fair and square\\" and did so with a winning margin of 10%. A subsequent Ofcom investigation found that Roberts had not been unfairly disadvantaged and that 0.99% of viewers that called couldn't get through to vote for Roberts, compared to 1% for Jackson. In week two of series five, fans of contestant Ruth Lorenzo complained that at one point during the live show an incorrect telephone number was displayed on screen, which may have influenced Lorenzo's ranking in the bottom two. ITV denied that the mistake affected the result when a spokesperson commented \\"During one short sequence, a single digit was missing from Ruth Lorenzo's vote number. The incorrect number was on screen for less than three seconds, and this was accompanied by an audio announcement giving the correct number. The error would not have changed the outcome of the vote.\\" Controversy about The X Factor voting arose again in the fifth week of the live stages following the elimination of Laura White. Thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom about a lack of transparency in the voting, saying that they could not get through to vote for White, or that their votes had been miscounted. ITV denied all allegations, stating that there were \\"absolutely no issues with the phone lines or the voting system\\".X Factor fans urge phone vote probe, The Press Association, 13 November 2008 Impact on the music industry Blur members Graham Coxon (left) and Damon Albarn (2009 image) have both criticised the show. The X Factor has been criticised for being a \\"soap opera\\" rather than a search for real talent. Musician Sting called the show \\"televised karaoke\\", with the contestants being encouraged to \\"conform to stereotypes\\", and saying that real musical talent is more likely to be found in pubs and clubs. Blur lead singer Damon Albarn also criticised the show for \\"creating a mindset that suggests you can get something for nothing and that it's easy to acquire status and fame\\", while Blur lead guitarist Graham Coxon similarly opined that \\"being a musician is not something you can become overnight\\", calling both The X Factor and rival show The Voice UK \\"disgraceful\\". V V Brown criticised the show for misleading young singers about how the music industry works, claiming at the 2009 MOBO Awards \\"I don't like it ‚Äì it's making kids think that they can get really famous easily, rather than working really hard to achieve something\\". James Morrison stated \\"[X Factor] sends out the message that you can be famous for doing fuck all and that you can succeed even if you're not a good singer\\". Amy Macdonald criticised the show for making it more difficult for talented youngsters to break through. American musician Moby claimed that although the show does produce good talent, it \\"cheapens\\" music, and criticised the show for telling the singers how to \\"sound\\" and \\"look\\". Charlotte Church shared a similar view and claimed that the show \\"doesn't have an interest in true craftsmanship or skill\\", whilst Elton John stated that \\"the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\\". Calvin Harris claimed that the show is a \\"joke\\" and that Cowell had a \\"frightening stranglehold\\" of the British charts, claiming that Cowell is \\"not really a music fan\\" and the show lacks creativity musically. Noel Gallagher attacked the show for having \\"absolutely nothing to do with music and everything to do with television\\" and questioned the use of judges such as Minogue who, he suggested, \\"wouldn't know talent if it kicked [her]\\". However, in a 2011 interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, Gallagher stated that he watched the show and that \\"people take it too seriously about its effect on music.\\"Noel Gallagher (Interview on The Jonathan Ross Show - 2011-10-21) [HD] \\\\- YouTube Kasabian frontman Tom Meighan also claimed his disbelief at how the judges can be taken seriously as music critics, considering Minogue has had few pop hits herself. He also expressed his disbelief at how popular the show was, claiming \\"The X Factor is like something The Riddler would do in Batman. It sucks out everyone's brains\\", and believed that the music produced from the show was \\"appalling\\". Series five contestant Diana Vickers expressed that she was \\"glad [she] didn't win The X Factor\\", as she would not have had the freedom to write most of her album or appear in a theater show. She did not want to be signed to Cowell's label as she said she wanted to be \\"[her] own artist\\". She said that \\"the originality is stripped away from those who do make it. Between then and now, I've been given time to grow, do The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, which I'd never been able to do had I won.\\" La Roux singer Elly Jackson claimed that The X Factor had \\"ruined the music industry\\" and that the show overshadowed new artists who were writing their own material. Cowell responded to this particular criticism, arguing that the money made from the sales of The X Factor contestants music is then used to develop new artists. In 2012, MC Kinky said \\"shows like X Factor and Britain's Got Talent reduce the art of making music and practicing your craft to the level of a low rent game show with huge financial backing and support. It's a means to make money, not a means to produce ground breaking or interesting artists that demonstrate what they are feeling or are compelled to do. It's corporate.\\" Annie Lennox, lead singer of the Eurythmics, claimed that the \\"X Factor is a specific thing for people that want to go through that process, it's a factory, you know, and it's owned and stitched-up by puppet masters.\\" Paul Weller, former frontman of The Jam, said that there would be no way he would ever appear as a mentor on shows like The X Factor. Pink Floyd guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour has also criticised the show, calling it \\"ghastly\\" and criticizing it for its lack of hard work and creativity. A similar opinion was shared by Suggs, frontman of Madness, who said that \\"The charts are being filled up with people who haven't really understood what it is to be an artist. It leaves less room for people who are trying to struggle their way around pubs and clubs and make it to the top in a more organic fashion.\\" A protest against the show's impact on the music industry resulted in Rage Against the Machine claiming the 2009 Christmas number one in the UK Before the UK Singles Chart started to include streaming data in its chart, another criticism of The X Factor is that the winner routinely achieves the number one spot in the UK Christmas singles charts, which, it is claimed, has taken the magic out of the event. In 2008, a campaign was launched to encourage people to buy Jeff Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's song \\"Hallelujah\\" instead of 2008 X Factor winner Alexandra Burke's version; however Burke beat Buckley's version which charted at number two. A similar campaign was launched by Jon Morter on Facebook in December 2009, encouraging the public to buy Rage Against the Machine's 1992 song \\"Killing in the Name\\" to prevent the X Factor winner being the Christmas number one for the fifth year running. By 9 December (less than a week after launching) over 500,000 people had signed up, with much media interest. The campaign was ultimately successful with a winning margin of around 50,000 copies. The group performed a free concert in London as a thank you to all the fans. In 2011 and 2012, show winners Little Mix and James Arthur released their debut singles the week before Christmas, and achieved number one those weeks. Product placement In series 3, media watchdog Ofcom upheld a complaint that The Xtra Factor had inappropriately featured close-up shots of the products of then sponsor Nokia. The complaint referred to an episode that showed the judges of the show jokingly sending insults to each other by text message, during the segment close up shots of Nokia products were clearly visible a total of thirteen times. A second complaint about the showing of a Motorola phone was not upheld. In January 2013, Ofcom ruled that The X Factor had breached broadcasting rules by excessively plugging the hotel where the finalists stayed, saying it was mentioned in eight out of the 13 pre-recorded introduction videos for the finalists, including shots of them arriving featuring close-up shots of the hotel's sign. Ofcom found \\"the overall number of references to be excessive\\" and \\"therefore judged that there was insufficient editorial justification for the repeated references to the hotel during the program.\\" They concluded that \\"the cumulative effect of these references resulted in the program as a whole giving undue prominence to the hotel.\\" Trailers On 30 July 2012, the trailer for the series premiered. Entitled \\"Whose Time Is Now?\\", it features six former The X Factor contestants ‚Äì winners Lewis, Alexandra Burke and Little Mix, and runners-up JLS and Murs and third place One Direction ‚Äì talking about their time on the show and how it changed their lives. Male winners Steve Brookstein, Shayne Ward, Leon Jackson, Joe McElderry and Matt Cardle were not included. McElderry, who won in 2009, said \\"I'm just gonna keep doing my thing\\", which many fans believed to be prompted by the trailer. McElderry later admitted that he was not angry about not being included in the trailer. In an interview with the Daily Star Sunday, he said: \\"I'm not on Simon [Cowell]'s label so I wouldn't expect him to promote me. If they want to erase the fact I won [The] X Factor or try to hide it, I don't care. Personally I am proud I came from The X Factor. If [Cowell] doesn't feel the same then you'll have to ask him why.\\" The mash-up video trailer promoting the tenth series was published as a \\"mash up of all the best a decade of X Factor has to offer\\" on 25 July 2013. The trailer consists of various music videos from 13 past contestants: One Direction, Leona Lewis, JLS, Olly Murs, Little Mix, Union J, Amelia Lily, Joe McElderry, Alexandra Burke, Cher Lloyd, Shayne Ward, Misha B and James Arthur. However, fans questioned the absence of successful contestants Diana Vickers and Rebecca Ferguson. Also, winners Steve Brookstein, Leon Jackson and Matt Cardle were not included. Cardle's manager Will Talbot said that he believed the show was \\"attempting to erase Matt from the history books.

Bag-ao (born July 3, 1969) is a Filipino human rights lawyer and agrarian reform advocate who was a member of the House of Representatives of the Philippines between 2010 and 2019. Currently, she serves as the Governor of the Province of the Dinagat Islands - since June 30, 2019. She has been dubbed as the 'Dragon Slayer' after consecutively defeating two of the most prominent members of the most influential political dynasty in the Dinagat Islands. One of them, the Ecleo family.  Education  Born in Manila, but raised in Loreto, Surigao del Norte (now part of Dinagat Islands), Bag-ao took her elementary education at Loreto Central Elementary School. She then took her secondary education at Southeastern College in Pasay City. Bag- ao earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from the De La Salle University in 1989, and her Juris Doctor (JD) degree from the Ateneo Law School of the Ateneo de Manila University in 1993, where she became a Judge de Veyra Scholarship Awardee and an Ateneo School of Law Scholarship Awardee. She passed the Philippine Bar Examinations in 1994. She was a Law and Human Rights Humphrey Fellow ‚Äî in the Academic Year 2006-2007 - at the University of Minnesota, under a program implemented by the Fulbright Commission of the United States of America.  Career  = As an alternative lawyer = Bag-ao believes that alternative lawyering is not simply a career but an advocacy for a particular way of life for lawyers and legal advocates; alternative lawyering is a life that is not based on sacrifices and compromises, but a choice and a lifelong commitment. Bag-ao is one of the founders and the former Executive Director of BALAOD Mindanaw, a law group based in Mindanao, the Philippines working for the advancement and protection of the rights of farmers, fisherfolks, indigenous peoples and women's and other marginalized groups through the creative and developmental use of the law. As an alternative lawyer, Bag-ao's work is not limited to litigating cases. She is also involved in policy reform both at the local and national levels, working with different advocacy groups and law school based organizations in the country. Committed to the goal of demystifying the law as a monopoly of lawyers and the formally educated, she provides paralegal training and legal clinics to grassroots organizations and has won cases with them. Bag-ao is a member of the independent secretariat to the peace talks between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Revolutionary Worker's Party of Mindanao (RPMM) that facilitated the signing of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and the agreement to integrate community consultations as an essential component of the peace process. In 2004, Bag-ao was asked to become the special consultant to the Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform and facilitated the awarding of numerous land titles to farmer-beneficiaries. She was also responsible for the formulation and issuance of a Memorandum Circular ‚Äî later affirmed by the Supreme Court ‚Äî requiring the DAR to proceed with the acquisition and distribution of lands to farmer-beneficiaries despite injunction orders issued by regular courts. Bag- ao provided leadership for the Alternative Law Groups (ALG), as a Convenor in 2005-2006 and as a Council Member thereafter. The ALG is a coalition of twenty (20) alternative legal resource non-government organizations engaged in developmental lawyering in different parts of the country. Under Bag-ao's leadership, the ALG implemented a program in partnership with the Supreme Court which complemented its Action Program on Judicial Reform and resulted in the Supreme Court's programs on access to justice by the poor. The ALG also pushed for the enactment of several social legislations, including the enactment of the Juvenile Justice Law and the Supreme Court ruling on the indefeasibility of titles issued under the agrarian reform program. Bag-ao was the lead counsel in the Sumilao Farmers' case, a case of indigenous farmers who walked for 1,700 kilometers from Bukidnon, Mindanao to Manila to claim rights to their lands under agrarian reform against one of the biggest corporations in the Philippines. The Sumilao Farmers' case generated national and international attention and support. The case also inspired the Church to shepherd their cause and eventually resulted in an agreement under which the farmers would be given back their land.Sumilao farmers back in Bukidnon land (originally posted in the Philippine Daily Inquirer) She also became one of the counsels for the Banasi Farmers of Camarines Sur who have reclaimed their rights in 2008 and the Calatagan Farmers of Batangas. Bag-ao and other co- counsels, together with Farmer Leaders, helped educate the Banasi Farmers on their rights and how they could fight for these peacefully. After they won the case, the Banasi Farmers continue to be partners in the implementation of agrarian reform and in pushing for good governance. = As Akbayan representative = On 30 June 2010, Bag-ao was sworn in as the second representative of Akbayan Party in the 15th Philippine Congress. Together with fellow Akbayan Representative Walden Bello, she is the author of numerous progressive bills in Congress such as House Bill 3763 (Minerals Management Bill), House Bill 513 (Reproductive Health Bill), House Bill 468 (Sangguniang Kabataan Reform and Empowerment Bill), House Bill 515 (Anti-Discrimination Bill), House Bill 5312 (Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Bill), and House Bill 4268 (Healthy Beverages Options Bill or the 'Chip's Bill').''' Bag-ao is a principal author of Republic Act 10354Official Gazette of the Philippines: Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 - FULL TEXT or the Reproductive Health Law. She is also the principal author of House Bill 6545 or the National Land Use Bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives. Bag-ao was the Vice Chairperson of the House Committee on Agrarian Reform. She is one of the champions of Kaya Natin, a non-government organization founded by the late Interior and Local Government Secretary Jesse Robredo that advocates good governance and ethical leadership. She is also one of only two lady public prosecutors in the impeachment trial of convicted Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona. = As Dinagat Islands caretaker = As a native of the province and through the endorsement of Surigao del Norte Representatives Francisco Matugas and Guillermo Romarate, Jr., Bag-ao was appointed by House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. as the Legislative Liaison Officer or Caretaker of the Lone District of Dinagat Islands. Upon her assumption as Dinagat caretaker, Bag-ao led a series of consultations in the province's 100 barangays, asking the residents of their community concerns and development projects they wish to see. In just three months, Bag-ao was able to roll-out the following development programs and projects: * P3-million worth of free medical assistance at the Caraga Regional Hospital; * P8-million worth of scholarships for the Dinagat youth at the Surigao State College of Technology (SSCT) and other state universities and colleges; * P120-million worth of infrastructure projects for all barangays, including roads, bridges, water systems, barangay halls, barangay gym, sea walls, etc.; and * 77 \\"Sasakyan Ng Barangay\\" multicabs for faster delivery of government services even in the province's remotest communities. = As Dinagat Islands representative = At the May 2013 general elections, Bag-ao was elected representative of the Lone District of Dinagat Islands, edging out Dinagat municipal mayor Gwendolyn Ecleo with 3,248 votes. Bag-ao was dubbed as a 'Dragon Slayer' as she managed to defeat a political behemoth in her province. In the 16th Congress, she was elected as the Chairperson of the Special Committee on Land Use. She is the principal author of several legislative measures, such as the proposed National Land Use Act, the People's Freedom of Information Act, the Anti-Discrimination Bill, and the Agrarian Reform Commission Bill. In November 2015, she, along with fellow legislators Rep. Leni Robredo (3rd District of Camarines Sur), Rep. Bolet Banal (3rd District of Quezon City), and Rep. Teddy Baguilat (Lone District of Ifugao), introduced a new proposed measure entitled the Open Door Policy Bill, which seeks to prohibit government offices from denying citizens access to front line services and public meetings on the basis of attire. The bill gained international recognition when it was featured in Time.com. In January 2016, the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act was passed into law.Republic Act No. 10742, Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines Bag-ao is one of its principal authors in the House of Representatives through House Bill No. 109. In the May 2016 elections, Bag-ao was reelected as representative of the lone district of Dinagat Islands, defeating this time Gwendolyn Ecleo's older sibling, Jade Ecleo, who was the province's former governor. She was again lauded as a 'Dragon Slayer' as she has defeated the two most prominent members of the Ecleo political dynasty in Dinagat Islands. She has been pushing for the Anti-Discrimination Bill (now known as the SOGIE Equality Bill) to be passed into law since her assumption in the House of Representatives. Geraldine Roman has called her the \\"heart and soul\\" of the Anti-Discrimination Bill, to which she said that Roman is the \\"face of the Anti-Discrimination Bill\\" as she is the only transgender lawmaker in the country. Bag-ao is the pioneer of the Equality Champions Coalition between the Senate and the House of Representative, along with Senator Risa Hontiveros. In March 2017, Bag-ao voted against the re-imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines. The ruling party in the Philippines stripped her committee chairmanship on People's Participation afterwards. She later said that she voted \\"no\\" because of her principle and her belief that the death penalty is always inhumane and wrong. In September 2017, Bag-ao voted against a House budget ruling that shall give one thousand pesos (around 20 dollars) for the 2018 budget of the Commission on Human Rights in the Philippines. Bag-ao was one of the only 32 lawmakers to vote against the budget. The budget, however passed in the House after more than a hundred Duterte-allied lawmakers voted in its favor. Public outraged erupted afterwards, condemning the humongous budget cut for a commission responsible for looking at the human rights violations of the government. Protests were held in various cities nationwide. The budget was eventually restored to its original amount after a few days of public outcry against the budget cut. On the same month, after 17 years of political limbo, the SOGIE Equality Bill finally passed in the House of Representative under Bag-ao's principal authorship. Bag-ao was the vice-chairperson of the House Committees on Ecology, Labor and Employment, and Population and Family Relations. She had influential political powers on the Committees on Women and Gender Equality, Natural Resources, Mindanao Affairs, Human Rights, Justice, and Constitutional Amendments, among many others. In October 2017, she was one of the only two House committee members who voted against the sufficiency of the grounds to impeach Chief Justice Sereno. Bag-ao argued that many of the allegations being thrown at the Chief Justice are not sufficient and not even grounds for impeachment.

Marburg virus (MARV) causes Marburg virus disease in humans and nonhuman primates, a form of viral hemorrhagic fever. The virus is considered to be extremely dangerous. The World Health Organization (WHO) rates it as a Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring biosafety level 4-equivalent containment). In the United States, the NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ranks it as a Category A Priority Pathogen and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists it as a Category A Bioterrorism Agent. It is also listed as a biological agent for export control by the Australia Group. The virus can be transmitted by exposure to one species of fruit bats or it can be transmitted between people via body fluids through unprotected sex and broken skin. The disease can cause bleeding (haemorrhage), fever, and other symptoms similar to Ebola. However, Marburg virus is not the same as Ebola, although similar. Actual treatment of the virus after infection is not possible but early, professional treatment of symptoms like dehydration considerably increases survival chances.Marburg virus disease Fact sheet Updated October 2017 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_marburg/en/ In 2009, expanded clinical trials of an Ebola and Marburg vaccine began in Kampala, Uganda.Beth Skwarecki Ebola, Marburg DNA Vaccines Prove Safe in Phase 1 Trial Medscape Medical News, September 17, 2014Evaluating an Ebola and a Marburg Vaccine in Uganda U.S. Department of Health & Human Services History =Discovery= CryoEM reconstruction of a section of the Marburg virus nucleocapsid. EMDB entry Marburg virus was first described in 1967. During the 1960s it was noticed during small outbreaks of Marburg virus disease in the German cities Marburg and Frankfurt and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. German workers were exposed to tissues of infected grivet monkeys (the African green monkey, Chlorocebus aethiops) at the city's former main industrial plant, the Behringwerke, then part of Hoechst, and later part of CSL Behring. During these outbreaks, 31 people became infected and seven of them died. =Nomenclature= The virus is one of two members of the species Marburg marburgvirus, which is included in the genus Marburgvirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The name Marburg virus is derived from Marburg (the city in Hesse, Germany, where the virus was first discovered) and the taxonomic suffix virus. Marburg virus was first introduced under this name in 1967. In 2005, the virus name was changed to Lake Victoria marburgvirus, confusingly making the only difference in distinguishing between a Marburg virus organism and its species as a whole italicization, as in Lake Victoria marburgvirus. Still, most scientific articles continued to use the name Marburg virus. Consequently, in 2010, the name Marburg virus was reinstated and the species name changed. Virology =Genome= Marburg virion and genome Like all mononegaviruses, marburgvirions contain non-infectious, linear nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA genomes of negative polarity that possess inverse-complementary 3' and 5' termini, do not possess a 5' cap, are not polyadenylated, and are not covalently linked to a protein. Marburgvirus genomes are approximately 19 kbp long and contain seven genes in the order 3'-UTR-NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L-5'-UTR. =Structure= Like all filoviruses, marburgvirions are filamentous particles that may appear in the shape of a shepherd's crook or in the shape of a \\"U\\" or a \\"6\\", and they may be coiled, toroid, or branched. Marburgvirions are generally 80 nm in width, but vary somewhat in length. In general, the median particle length of marburgviruses ranges from 795 to 828 nm (in contrast to ebolavirions, whose median particle length was measured to be 974‚Äì1,086 nm ), but particles as long as 14,000 nm have been detected in tissue culture. Marburgvirions consist of seven structural proteins. At the center is the helical ribonucleocapsid, which consists of the genomic RNA wrapped around a polymer of nucleoproteins (NP). Associated with the ribonucleoprotein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) with the polymerase cofactor (VP35) and a transcription activator (VP30). The ribonucleoprotein is embedded in a matrix, formed by the major (VP40) and minor (VP24) matrix proteins. These particles are surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the host cell membrane. The membrane anchors a glycoprotein (GP1,2) that projects 7 to 10 nm spikes away from its surface. While nearly identical to ebolavirions in structure, marburgvirions are antigenically distinct. =Entry= Niemann‚ÄìPick C1 (NPC1) cholesterol transporter protein appears to be essential for infection with both Ebola and Marburg virus. Two independent studies reported in the same issue of Nature showed that Ebola virus cell entry and replication requires NPC1. When cells from patients lacking NPC1 were exposed to Ebola virus in the laboratory, the cells survived and appeared immune to the virus, further indicating that Ebola relies on NPC1 to enter cells. This might imply that genetic mutations in the NPC1 gene in humans could make some people resistant to one of the deadliest known viruses affecting humans. The same studies described similar results with Marburg virus, showing that it also needs NPC1 to enter cells. Furthermore, NPC1 was shown to be critical to filovirus entry because it mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein and that the second lysosomal domain of NPC1 mediates this binding. In one of the original studies, a small molecule was shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection by preventing the virus glycoprotein from binding to NPC1. In the other study, mice that were heterozygous for NPC1 were shown to be protected from lethal challenge with mouse-adapted Ebola virus. =Replication= Marburg virus replication cycle The marburg virus life cycle begins with virion attachment to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant release of the virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. Marburgvirus L binds to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. Ecology Egyptian fruit bats. In 2009, the successful isolation of infectious MARV was reported from caught healthy Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus). This isolation, together with the isolation of infectious RAVV, strongly suggests that Old World fruit bats are involved in the natural maintenance of marburgviruses. Further studies are necessary to establish whether Egyptian rousettes are the actual hosts of MARV and RAVV or whether they get infected via contact with another animal and therefore serve only as intermediate hosts. In 2012 the first experimental infection study of Rousettus aegyptiacus with MARV provided further insight into the possible involvement of these bats in MARV ecology. Experimentally infected bats developed relatively low viremia lasting at least 5 days, but remained healthy and did not develop any notable gross pathology. The virus also replicated to high titers in major organs (liver and spleen), and organs that might possibly be involved in virus transmission (lung, intestine, reproductive organs, salivary gland, kidney, bladder, and mammary gland). The relatively long period of viremia noted in this experiment could possibly also facilitate mechanical transmission by blood sucking arthropods in addition to infection of susceptible vertebrate hosts by direct contact with infected blood. Evolution The viral strains fall into two clades‚ÄîRavn virus and Marburg virus. The Marburg strains can be divided into two‚ÄîA and B. The A strains were isolated from Uganda (five from 1967), Kenya (1980) and Angola (2004‚Äì2005) while the B strains were from the Democratic Republic of the Congo epidemic (1999‚Äì2000) and a group of Ugandan isolates isolated in 2007‚Äì2009. The mean evolutionary rate of the whole genome was 3.3 √ó 10‚àí4 substitutions/site/year (credibility interval 2.0‚Äì4.8).The Marburg strains had a mean root time of the most recent common ancestor of 177.9 years ago (95% highest posterior density 87‚Äì284) suggesting an origin in the mid 19th century. In contrast, the Ravn strains origin dated back to a mean 33.8 years ago (the early 1980s). The most probable location of the Marburg virus ancestor was Uganda whereas that of the RAVV ancestor was Kenya. Human disease MARV is one of two Marburg viruses that causes Marburg virus disease (MVD) in humans (in the literature also often referred to as Marburg hemorrhagic fever, MHF). The other one is Ravn virus (RAVV). Both viruses fulfill the criteria for being a member of the species Marburg marburgvirus because their genomes diverge from the prototype Marburg marburgvirus or the Marburg virus variant Musoke (MARV/Mus) by <10% at the nucleotide level. =Recorded outbreaks= { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style =\\"width: 100%\\" + Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks due to Marburg virus (MARV) infection - !

Merck was developing it, but discontinued development. Biological weapon The Soviet Union had an extensive offensive and defensive biological weapons program that included MARV. At least three Soviet research institutes had MARV research programs during the Cold War: the Virology Center of the Scientific-Research Institute for Microbiology in Zagorsk (today Sergiev Posad), the Scientific-Production Association \\"Vektor\\" (today the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology \\"Vektor\\") in Koltsovo, and the Irkutsk Scientific-Research Anti-Plague Institute of Siberia and the Far East in Irkutsk. As most performed research was highly classified, it remains unclear how successful the MARV program was. However, Soviet defector Ken Alibek claimed that a weapon filled with MARV was tested at the Stepnogorsk Scientific Experimental and Production Base in Stepnogorsk, Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (today Kazakhstan), suggesting that the development of a MARV biological weapon had reached advanced stages. Independent confirmation for this claim is lacking. At least one laboratory accident with MARV, resulting in the death of Koltsovo researcher Nikolai Ustinov, occurred during the Cold War in the Soviet Union and was first described in detail by Alibek. MARV is a select agent under US law.

Discovery Skeletal restoration of the holotype by Scott Hartman, with known parts shown in red Talos is known only from the holotype specimen UMNH VP 19479, a partial postcranial skeleton of a subadult individual including the hindlimbs, pelvis, vertebral fragments, chevrons and the left ulna. It was discovered and collected in 2008 by M. J. Knell during the Kaiparowits Basin Project, initiated by the University of Utah in 2000, from the Kaiparowits Formation within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. It was first named by Lindsay E. Zanno, David J. Varricchio, Patrick M. O'Connor, Alan L. Titus, and Michael J. Knell in 2011 and the type species is Talos sampsoni. The generic name comes from Talos, a giant bronze automaton in Greek mythology and is intended to be a pun on the English word talon. The specific name honors television paleontologist Dr. Scott D. Sampson for researching and collecting fossils during the Kaiparowits Basin Project. Description Restoration. Talos is a troodontid, a group of small, bird- like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. Talos is approximately in length, and its weight has been estimated at thirty-eight kilograms. Talos had a sickle claw. That of the specimen was damaged during life, possibly in an attack on prey. In 2011 Talos was assigned to the Troodontidae. A cladistic analysis indicated it formed a clade of derived troodontids together with Byronosaurus, Saurornithoides, Zanabazar and Troodon. Paleoecology Vertebrae =Habitat= The only known specimen of Talos was recovered at the Kaiparowits Formation, in southern Utah. Argon-argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period.Roberts EM, Deino AL, Chan MA (2005) 40Ar/39Ar age of the Kaiparowits Formation, southern Utah, and correlation of contemporaneous Campanian strata and vertebrate faunas along the margin of the Western Interior Basin.

The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.Titus, Alan L. and Mark A. Loewen (editors). At the Top of the Grand Staircase: The Late Cretaceous of Southern Utah. 2013. Indiana University Press. Hardbound: 634 pp. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. =Paleofauna= A Kosmoceratops disturbed from its rest by a wandering Talos Talos shared its paleoenvironment with theropods such as dromaeosaurids, ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox, tyrannosaurids like Teratophoneus, armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus and Gryposaurus monumentensis, the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi, Nasutoceratops titusi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus giganteus. Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.

The episode was written by series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost, and directed by Lynch. It features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Ray Wise and Richard Beymer; and introduces Michael J. Anderson as The Man from Another Place, Miguel Ferrer as Albert Rosenfield and David Patrick Kelly as Jerry Horne. Twin Peaks centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named. In this episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) tells Sheriff Truman (Ontkean) and his deputies about a unique method of narrowing down the suspects in Palmer's death. Meanwhile, Cooper's cynical colleague Albert Rosenfield (Ferrer) arrives in town, and Cooper has a strange dream that elevates the murder investigation to a new level. \\"Episode 2\\" was first broadcast on April 19, 1990, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network, and was watched by an audience of 19.2 million households in the United States, equating to roughly 21 percent of the available audience. \\"Episode 2\\" has been well-received since its initial broadcast, and is regarded by critics as a ground-breaking television episode. It has since influenced, and been parodied by, several subsequent television series. Academic readings of the episode have highlighted its depiction of heuristic, a priori knowledge, and the sexual undertones of several characters' actions. Plot =Background= The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her classmate Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall). However, other inhabitants of the town have their own suspicions: the violent, drug-dealing truck driver Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) is seen as a possible suspect. =Events= The Horne family‚ÄîBen (Richard Beymer), Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn), and Johnny (Robert Bauer)‚Äîare eating dinner when they are interrupted by Ben's brother Jerry (David Patrick Kelly). The brothers share brie and butter baguettes while Ben tells Jerry of Laura Palmer's murder and the failing of the Ghostwood project. They decide to visit One Eyed Jacks, a casino and brothel across the Canada‚ÄìUS border, where Ben wins a coin flip to determine who will be the first to sleep with the newest prostitute. Bobby Briggs and Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) drive into the woods to pick up a hidden delivery of cocaine, but are ambushed by Leo Johnson, who demands the $10,000 the pair owe him. Leo also hints that he suspects someone has been sleeping with his wife Shelly (M√§dchen Amick), then scares the pair off. When Bobby visits Shelly at her home the next day, he discovers that Leo has beaten her. Dale Cooper receives a phone call from Hawk (Michael Horse) about a one-armed man seen at Ronette Pulaski's hospital bed. The next morning, Cooper gathers together Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputies Hawk and Brennan (Harry Goaz), and Lucy Moran (Kimmy Robertson) in a forest clearing to demonstrate his unusual approach to eliminating suspects from their investigation. As each suspect's name is read from a list, Cooper throws a stone at a bottle placed away. Each time he hits the bottle with a stone, he considers the previous name read out to be of interest to the case. The method points his suspicion at Leo Johnson and psychiatrist Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn). Dale's fellow FBI agent Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) arrives later, while Truman and Cooper review evidence, and immediately causes friction between himself and Truman. James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) discuss their new relationship, and kiss passionately on Donna's sofa. Elsewhere, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), still mourning Laura's death, dances in his living room, sobbing and holding a portrait of Laura as he does so. He breaks open the picture's frame, cutting his hands, as his wife Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) screams at him to stop. Cooper retires to bed at his hotel room, and experiences a strange dream featuring the one-armed man, who identifies himself as MIKE, and BOB, who vows to \\"kill again\\". Cooper then dreams he is in a room hung with red curtains. The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) and Laura Palmer speak to him in a jarring and disjointed manner, before Laura leans over to whisper in his ear. Cooper wakes up, telephones Harry, and declares that he knows who the murderer is. Production \\"Episode 2\\" was the second episode of the series to have been directed by series creator David Lynch, who had also helmed \\"Pilot\\", and would direct a further four episodes during Twin Peaks run. The episode was written by both Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost; the pair had co-written the prior two episodes. Frost would pen a further eight scripts for the series after \\"Episode 2\\", while Lynch would write just one episode‚Äîthe second season opening installment, \\"Episode 8\\". \\"Episode 2\\" introduces the character of The Man from Another Place, played by Michael J. Anderson. The Red Room seen in the episode's final scene was created from scratch by Lynch for the European release of \\"Pilot\\", and was not originally intended to be a part of the American series. Lynch was so pleased with the result that he decided to incorporate it into the regular series. The Red Room would later be revealed as a waiting room for the Black Lodge, a mystical dimension bordering the town of Twin Peaks. Lynch claims to have conceived most of the sequence while leaning against his car on a cold night while its chassis was hot, and free- associating ideas. The director first met Anderson in 1987 while continuing work on Ronnie Rocket, a planned film project about \\"electricity and a three- foot guy with red hair\\" which was ultimately scrapped. He thought of Anderson immediately upon conceiving the Black Lodge. alt=A man in a tuxedo looks directly at the camera, slightly smiling. Miguel Ferrer, who made his first appearance as Albert Rosenfield in this episode, had met Lynch while working on another film project that was also never made. Lynch remembered Ferrer when casting Twin Peaks, and sent him the scripts for both \\"Episode 1\\" and \\"Episode 2\\". Ferrer found the scripts difficult to understand until Frost gave him a recording of \\"Pilot\\", which cleared up the actor's confusion. Dialogue heard in the dream sequence uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned to use it in his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.Byers 2001, 41:40‚Äì42:11 Frank Byers, the episode's director of photography, has stated that the chief inspiration for his choice to use wide-angle lenses and soft lighting throughout the episode was the 1958 Orson Welles film Touch of Evil.Byers 2001, 05:15‚Äì06:05 Byers also eschewed the use of additional lighting beyond that which he felt was necessary, and chose to work mainly with the natural light of the location or set in question, and to light the scene from the floor when additional light was needed.Byers 2001, 07:30‚Äì08:05 The location used for One Eyed Jacks appeared in only one other episode of the series after its appearance here, with footage for both filmed on the same day. When the setting was revisited in the series' second season, a set was built to represent another part of the building instead.Byers 2001, 08:10‚Äì10:04 The female cast members were deliberately lit with soft lighting from a close range, as this helped to create a \\"veneer of innocence and comfort\\".Byers 2001, 25:40‚Äì28:25 Kimmy Robertson‚Äîwho plays sheriff's office receptionist Lucy Moran‚Äîhas described Lynch's directorial style as hypnotic, finding that his question-and-answer approach of discussing scenes with the cast was unique among directors she had worked with. Robertson also noted that during the filming of Cooper's stone-throwing, Lynch \\"sat [the cast] down and told Kyle he was going to hit the bottle ... Kyle hit it, and everybody freaked out. It was like David used the power of the universe\\". Themes Scenes in \\"Episode 2\\"‚Äîespecially the rock-throwing scene in the forest‚Äîhave been cited as introducing a spiritual side to the character of Dale Cooper, which would also be expounded in the later \\"Episode 16\\". Simon Riches, in an essay included in The Philosophy of David Lynch, has noted that the Red Room dream sequence is an example of the difficulty in rationalizing a priori knowledge‚Äîthe \\"lack of empirical evidence that ... a faculty of intuition exists\\" in the mind is here represented by the \\"nonphysical\\", dreamlike Red Room. Cooper's heuristic approach \\"pointedly avoids the routine deductive apparati of logic, clues or muscle\\". The fact that the series' protagonist embraces this intuitive manner of deduction sets Twin Peaks \\"at odds with the naturalistic trend in analytic philosophy\\". This dreamlike approach is a hallmark of Lynch, who, according to Greg Olson in his book Beautiful Dark, \\"has always identified himself as an artist first, a man fascinated by spiritual realms who's committed to expressing his inner life\\". The episode's reliance on surrealism has also been seen as symptomatic of \\"a broader move away from social realism within television drama\\". The episode makes use of strong color cues and unusual camera angles‚Äîin particular, the brown color palette and low-angle shots used to represent the character of Leland Palmer have been described by Helen Wheatley, author of Gothic Television, as creating \\"a mood of domestic terror\\", which serves to cue the audience to his eventual outing as his daughter's killer. Palmer's dance while holding his daughter's picture has been seen as \\"a time-honored metaphor for marriage\\", an \\"incestuous roundelay\\" which hints towards his abusive past. Both incest and violent sexuality would become recurring themes for the series, examples of which include Palmer's later murder and possible molestation of his niece Maddy and Benjamin Horne's unwitting brush with incest with his masked daughter in the One-Eyed Jacks brothel. Broadcast and reception \\"Episode 2\\" first aired on the ABC Network on April 19, 1990. The initial broadcast was viewed by households in the United States‚Äîwhich represented of the available audience and of all households in the country. This represented a drop in viewing figures from the previous episode, \\"Episode 1\\", which was seen by households, or of the available audience. The broadcast inspired several complaints about the sexual overtones of the scene in which the characters of Ben and Jerry Horne eat baguette sandwiches. The episode has been well- received critically. Writing for The Boston Globe, Gail Caldwell compared Lynch and Frost's script for the episode to the works of mid-20th century American writers Sherwood Anderson, Flannery O'Connor and Truman Capote, describing it as an \\"excavation of the fear and madness poised behind an ordinary small-town veneer\\". Caldwell also praised Lynch's direction, finding that several of the episode's \\"nerve-wracking\\" scenes lasted just the right amount of time to be effective, and noting that \\"the line between confronting the abyss and exploiting it is one Lynch walks again and again\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps rated the episode an A, calling it \\"one of the most peculiar hours of television ever to air on a network\\". He praised the episode's portrayal of the Black Lodge, called the dream sequence \\"some of the most disquieting filmmaking Lynch has ever done\\", and described its depiction as \\"a weirdly All-American supernatural system\\" that seems \\"completely terrifying\\". Fellow A.V. Club writer Noel Murray felt that the episode pushed \\"into previously unexplored television territory\\", and that the climactic Black Lodge dream sequence came to be seen as \\"the signature moment in the entirety of Twin Peaks\\". Den of Geek's Doralba Picerno has called the episode \\"truly groundbreaking TV material\\", noting the use of \\"surreal imagery with its roots in psychoanalysis\\". Writing for AllMovie, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four out of five stars, called it \\"memorable and pivotal\\", and described the Red Room dream as \\"unforgettable\\". Jen Chaney, writing for The Washington Post, has called the episode \\"the best in the series\\". Chaney described it, and the dream sequence specifically, as having \\"turned Twin Peaks into a water-cooler phenomenon\\", and noted that it may have inspired later series such as The Sopranos and Lost to \\"feel comfortable taking risks with their audience\\". The Washington Post Tom Shales has described the dream sequence as \\"the scene that separated the men from the boys\\", noting that it further polarized the series' audience, attracting loyal viewers and putting off others. The sequence, and the episode as a whole, attracted negative criticism from The Boston Globe Ed Siegel, who felt that the series \\"lost its magic\\" by this point. Siegel added that \\"anyone with less than a semester's worth of either Postminimalism 101 or Absurdism 102 can come up with dancing dwarves, one-armed men, psychic detectives, psycho killers, llamas in the waiting room and hints of incest and necrophilia\\", and felt that a reliance on surrealism made Lynch seem to be a \\"one trick pony\\". The episode's ending was parodied in \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\", a 1995 two-part episode of The Simpsons, in which Dale Cooper and The Man from Another Place were replaced by the characters of Chief Wiggum and Lisa Simpson, respectively. The backwards speech and unexplained shadow moving across a wall were included in the parody, which takes place in a detailed recreation of the Black Lodge.

GEN had three main programmes: Editors Lab, the Data Journalism Awards, Startups for News, as well as an upcoming hub for the international data journalism community. The organisation‚Äôs flagship event, the GEN Summit, gathered over 830 participants from 70 countries. The GEN newsletter was read weekly by more than 13,800 subscribers. It is a non-profit, non-governmental association. Its goal was to empower newsroom leaders to innovate by breaking down the barriers between traditional and new media. GEN also strived to demonstrate the value of data journalism so that information can be gathered and shared to define an open journalism model for the future, and create new journalistic concepts and tools. The GEN Community was launched in September 2014. The GEN Community website enabled people to connect, share, compare, collaborate on new media projects. Prototypes from the Editors Lab program and the Data Journalism Awards were also featured on the GEN Community. There were more than 1,600 projects and 3,900 members on the GEN Community. The GEN Community was supported by the Open Society Foundations. GEN was established to respond to the increasing risks journalism faces, as media must be relevant and constantly innovate. Its role was to gather editors with different knowledge sets and to start a dialogue with engineers, developers and digital innovators. Its founding members were leading editors and top executives at The Washington Post, El Pa√≠s, BBC, Le Monde, Aftenposten, The Guardian, Clar√¨n, and many other media brands worldwide. It was a nonprofit organisation, financed through grants, membership, participation to the annual GEN Summit, sponsorship and donations. The Global Editors Network announced on 7 November 2019 that it would cease its activities due to a lack of sustainable finances. Mission GEN's objective was to promote newsroom innovation, foster new storytelling methods, and define the future of journalism by empowering editors-in-chief and senior news executives when working with publishers, media owners and news suppliers, as the delivery of news migrated to digital platforms. Editors on all platforms were confronted with the same challenges in news production. It was more obvious every day that they are members of the same community, all driven by a journalistic imperative and a common goal: how to invent tomorrow's journalism and to make it sustainable. The senior news executives who founded the Global Editors Network (GEN) were convinced that news producers and newsrooms across all platforms ‚Äì print, broadcast, online, mobile and wire services ‚Äì face comparable challenges. The association encouraged multilateral cooperation and collaborated with media development bodies and international journalism associations. Activities The GEN Summit conference gathered every year more than 750 editors-in-chief, journalists, data journalists, developers, designers, and entrepreneurs., and became one of the most popular media conferences. This conference also included the Data Journalism Awards ceremony, one of the main programmes of GEN, along with Startups for News, and the Editors Lab final. The GEN Summit took place in the following cities: * 27‚Äì30 November 2011: Hong Kong * 30 May-1 June 2012 and 19‚Äì21 June 2013: Paris * 11‚Äì13 June 2014 and 17‚Äì19 June 2015: Barcelona * 15‚Äì17 June 2016: Vienna * 21‚Äì23 June 2017: Vienna * 30 May‚Äì1 June 2018: Lisbon The GEN Summit 2019 took place in Athens, Greece, from the 13th to the 15th of June at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center. The Data Journalism Awards, the first international contest recognising outstanding work in the field of data journalism. In 2015, a total of 14 winners were selected from a shortlist of 78 by a jury panel led by Paul Steiger from ProPublica. In 2016, 12 winners were chosen among 471 submissions. In 2017, 12 winners were chosen among 573 submissions.. In 2018, 12 winners were chosen among 630 entries from 58 countries. The Data Journalism Den was a global hub solely dedicated to data journalism. It was a place built for journalists, coders, designers, experts, consultants, companies, foundations, volunteers, NGOs, and everyone involved or interested in the use and development of data journalism. The Editors Lab, a worldwide series of hackathons where teams of journalists, designers and developers compete in the development of innovative journalism tools, content and apps. These are hosted by newsrooms all over the world. Past editions were in: Poland, France, Netherlands, Turkey, UK, Spain, Germany, Indonesia, India, and more. The Final occurs during the GEN Summit and gathers the winning teams of each Editors Lab event. The purpose of Editors Lab is to ‚Ä≥break the barriers between the editorial and technical teams.‚Ä≥. The Editors Lab program partnered with Rappler for the sake of providing hackathons for Southeast Asian Nations. Startups For News is an international competition that rewards the most innovative startups disrupting the media industry. GEN selects startups that challenge the status quo with new editorial services for newsrooms or new ways of delivering journalistic content. During the GEN Summit, the winning startups from each category have the opportunity to pitch their work to GEN‚Äôs network of media innovators. The startups are also able to showcase their product in a dedicated ‚ÄòStartups for News‚Äô area at the GEN Summit exhibitors room. The winner of the Startup For News Final 2015 was SourceRise, and Trint, a transcription company, won in 2016. In 2017, the startup Flourish won, while Urbs Media was a runner-up in the competition.. In 2018, Vigilant won the competition. In 2018, GEN partnered with the European Forest Institute to launch the pilot project Lookout360¬∞, which supports journalists produce 360-degree videos on climate change and people‚Äôs lives. Lookout360¬∞ is the pilot project of a 6-month immersive storytelling accelerator programme. It combines in-field training and 3-month mentorship to support journalists produce immersive stories with a focus on climate change. Climate Publishers Network ‚Äì Ahead of the UN Climate Change Summit (COP21) in Paris, 25 media organisations from around the world created a new publishers network to collaborate on their coverage of climate change. The initiative was coordinated by the Global Editors Network. The Climate Publishers Network (CPN) provided a mutual syndication of articles related to climate change free of charge during the run-up to COP21. Each media organisation was able to re- publish material without having to worry about license fees. Digital Journalism Massive open online course (MOOC), in French, in conjunction with Rue89 and First Business MOOC. GEN has coordinated three MOOCs since the launch. GEN Study Tours ‚Äì Launched in 2013, the study tours programme aims to help discovery and practice sharing between editors. Board members The 14 GEN Board Members were executives from news organisations such as Mic, ProPublica, El Pa√≠s, Clar√≠n, Rappler, Cheddar, Aftenposten, etc. The President since September 2018 was Jim Roberts (editor-in-chief, Cheddar.com, replacing Cory Haik, former publisher of MIC and Peter Bale (former Chief Executive Officer at the Center for Public Integrity), after two years. The previous GEN Presidents were Xavier Vidal-Folch, Deputy Director of El Pa√≠s, and Ricardo Kirschbaum, the General Editor of Clar√≠n. Bertrand Pecquerie was the CEO of the association until its closure in November 2019. Closure The Global Editors Network announced on 7 November 2019 that it would cease its activities due to a lack of sustainable finances. CEO Bertrand Pecquerie said In a statement that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain a balance between GEN‚Äôs three main funding sources and to further diversify them.

He was born in Florence and educated at the Collegio Romano in Rome. From 1616 until his death in Florence at the age of 43, he was the principal court poet to the Medici family.Harness (2001) In addition to numerous theatrical entertainments and poems, he wrote the libretti for five operas, four of which have survived, although only La Flora composed by Marco da Gagliano and Jacopo Peri has an extant score. He was married twice, first to Emilia Rigogli by whom he had three sons and then to the painter Alessandra Furini. A collection of Salvadori's principal works curated by his son Francesco was published in 1668. Life and career Frontispiece of Salvadori's libretto for La Flora Salvadori was born in Florence in 1591. Like his fellow poet Gabriello Chiabrera, he was educated by the Jesuits at the Collegio Romano in Rome with financial support from Cosimo II de' Medici.Kirkendale (1993) p. 611 Described by the 19th century Italian philologist Francesco Trucchi as \\"gifted in the sciences, very erudite and well-versed in Latin and Greek\\",Trucchi (1847) p. 268. Original Italian: \\"Fu uomo savio, prudente e religioso; dottissimo nelle scienze, molto erudito, e versato nella lingua greca e latina . Salvadori was a member of both the Accademia Fiorentina and the Accademia della Crusca by 1608. He began working for the Medici family in 1613 when he collaborated with four other poets to write verses for a mock battle performed in honour of the visiting Duke of Urbino.The group of poets was headed by Giovanni Villifranchi and also included Ottavio Rinuccini, Alessandro Adimari, and Jacopo Cicognini. See Solerti (1905) p. 70 In 1616 he was given a permanent position as the principal court poet. In that capacity he provided the texts and libretti for numerous musical spectacles and court entertainments both sacred and secular, many of them marking royal occasions. One of the distinguishing features of Salvadori's opera libretti was his extensive use of the chorus not only to conclude each act but also to link scenes within an act or to frame the singers' solo pieces. He was a pioneer in the sacred opera genre (azione sacra) for which he wrote La regina Sant'Orsola (The Queen Saint Ursula) in 1624 and Istoria di Iudit (The story of Judith) in 1626. According to musicologist Kelley Harness, La istoria di Iudit was the basis for Martin Opitz's libretto for Judith (1635) and may well have influenced Giulio Rospigliosi's later libretti on religious subjects. Rospogliosi had attended the performance of La istoria di Iudit marking Cardinal Francesco Barberini's visit to the Medici court. A notable example of Salvadori's secular operas was La Flora which was performed as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Margherita de' Medici and Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma in 1628. Francesca Caccini, whose lengthy feud with Salvadori began in 1620 The composers of La Flora, Marco da Gagliano and Jacopo Peri, had previously worked with him on other operas as had the singer and composer Francesca Caccini. According to the Florentine chronicler Andrea Cavalcanti,Andrea Cavalcanti (1610-1672) belonged to an important Florentine family allied to the Medici. Like Salvadori, he was a member of the Accademia della Crusca and published biographies as well as court chronicles. Salvadori and Caccini fell out when she began publicly ridiculing him for casting whatever female singer he was pursuing at the time. In reply, he wrote the misogynistic poem \\"Donne musiche parlano dall'Inferno\\" (Women musicians speak from Hell) which was probably performed at the court's Epiphany celebrations in 1621.Harness (2006) pp. 179-180 Their feud continued over the casting of the 1625 revival of La regina Sant'Orsola and culminated in 1627 during the preparations for the wedding of Margherita de' Medici and Odoardo Farnese. The opera Salvadori had originally planned for the festivities was his Iole ed Ercole (Iole and Hercules) for which Jacopo Peri had composed the music. Caccini took her revenge by convincing Margherita and her mother, Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena, that the subject of the opera might be interpreted as reflecting Margherita's desire to control her new husband.Harness (2006) p. 179. Salvadori thus had to write a new libretto at relatively short notice‚ÄîLa Flora, based on the tale of Chloris and Zephyrus. Shortly thereafter, Caccini left the Medici court. Although the overwhelming majority of Salvadori's theatrical works were performed in Florence for the Medici, at least two of them were performed elsewhere. His set of intermedi, Olimpia abbandonata da Bireno (Olimpia abandoned by Bireno), was performed in Parma in 1622 for the Farnese court, and his equestrian ballet La selva d'Armida (Armida's forest) was performed in Vienna in 1631 to celebrate the marriage of Maria Anna of Spain and Ferdinand III of Austria.Garavaglia (2005) p. 84; Negri (1722) p.37 Salvadori also had connections with the Gonzaga court in Mantua. As early as 1608 he had spent some time there and had written an ode to Francesco Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua during his stay. The Duke's sister, Eleonora had asked for a copy of his opera Lo sposalizio di Medoro e Angelica (The marriage of Medoro and Angelica) which had been performed in Florence in 1619, with a view to having it performed at Mantua. Her marriage to the Holy Roman emperor intervened and before she could receive a copy. However, Salvadori and his composer, Marco da Gagliano, sent a revised version of the work to Ferdinando Gonzaga in 1622. In the end, it was not performed, but the libretto was published in 1623 with the support of Ferdinando and was dedicated to him. According to Kirkendale, Salvadori received another invitation to the court in 1623 after Ferdinando and his wife Caterina de' Medici were sent copies of his sacred poetry.The Medici Archive. Salvadori, Andrea di Francesco In 1628 Salvadori married Emilia Rigogli, who belonged to a prominent Florentine family. (Her brother was the poet Benedetto Rigogli). The marriage produced three sons, Francesco (1630), Jacopo (1631), and Emilio (1633). Francesco became a priest and served as Cardinal Girolamo Farnese's copyist. He was also a poet and writer in his own right and published several works, including a collection of poetry and a treatise on Seneca, Il filosofo cortigiano.Negri (1722) p. 218; Trucchi (1847) p. 268. Four months after Emilia's death in December 1633, Salvadori married the painter Alessandra Furini, a sister of Francesco Furini.Alessandra Furini, described as \\"a woman of unusual vivacity and spirit\\", had been a pupil of Cristofano Allori. Her sister Angelica married the composer Domenico Belli and was a prominent singer at the Medici court. Details of Salvadori's marriages are from Gregori (2007) pp. 21-28 Andrea Salvadori died in August 1634 at the age of 43 and was buried in the Chiesa dei Santi Simone e Giuda in Florence where a marble plaque with his portrait was erected by his sons.Richa (1754) p. 251. Works Scene from Act 1 of La regina Sant'Orsola in which Saint Ursula is surrounded by demons Le Poesie del Sig. Andrea Salvadori, curated by Salvadori's son Francesco and published in 1668, included all the works published during his lifetime, as well as several previously unpublished poems. It has a dedication and preface by Francesco Salvadori with quoted descriptions of his father's character and poetic style by Gian Vittorio Rossi and Cardinal Sforza Pallavicino.Le Poesie del Sig. Andrea Salvadori. Rome: Michele Ercole, 1668. Extended lists of Salvadori's works can also be found in Negri (1722) pp. 37-38; Kirkendale (1993) pp. 611-613; Franchi (1988) pp. 411-413 The following is a list of Salvadori's principal works. ;Opera libretti *Lo sposalizio di Medoro e Angelica (The wedding of Medoro and Angelica), in a prologue and three acts, music by Marco da Gagliano and Jacopo Peri, performed 1619, revised version published 1623 as Medoro, (score lost).

The grandest of these were the feste (festivals) to celebrate great court occasions which incorporated instrumental music, solo and choral singing, dancing, and drama. Invariably involving lavish spectacle, they were often accompanied by public pageants and masquerades. The festa di ballo was centered on a ballet, the festa d'armi on mock battles, and the festa a cavallo on displays of horsemanship, including elaborately choreographed equestrian ballets. Smaller scale stage works included intermedi, cantatas, and sung narrative poems to accompany tournaments. These were often performed as part of a veglia (late evening entertainment). Unless otherwise indicated all of the performances below took place in Florence. Equestrian ballet from Guerra di bellezza performed in the Piazza Santa Croce, 1616 *Comparsa d'Araspe, re de persiani (The appearance of Araspe, king of the Persians), festa performed February 1613 *Guerra d'amore (Battle of love), festa for Cosimo II de' Medici (with Cosimo II and his brother Lorenzo taking the roles of the rival kings Indamoro and Gradameto), performed during Carnival, February 1616British Library.

It was published posthumously in Le Poesie del Sig. Andrea Salvadori.

Their debut eponymous album was released May 6, 2008 by Central Standard Records, an Iowa-bred underground label co-founded by Aeon Grey. The album set the tone for subsequent works, establishing an approach which consistently includes a significant portion of the work presented without vocals, providing an overall presentation of an instrumental and poetically commentated piece. The vocal pieces are known for dynamic use of voice and often esoteric wordplay unique to the track paired with it, which at times, has been known to lead non-familiar listeners to assume that multiple vocalists play a part in the work. To date, no featuring of any other vocal artist has appeared on a Maxilla Blue record, as all production and turntablism has also been exclusively provided by Aeon Grey and Dj TouchNice. Members of the group have noted no intention of altering this trend, publicly stating that it is unnecessary to feature external components to create their sound. Each member has, however, participated in numerous side-works with other artists to create pieces under various titles. As the approach and presentation has remained intact, each subsequent release has carried the self-titled attribute, distinguished only by the numbered volume. It is said that were it not for the necessity of distinguishing the releases from each other for distributive purposes, the trio would have released each record simply as \\"Maxilla Blue,\\" leaving the familiar listener and general consumers to differentiate the body of work. Through tour-work, the group has appeared live in the Midwest, Mountain, West coast and Southwestern U.S regions, Germany and France. Vol. 2 was released June 15, 2010, also on Central Standard Records, marking the first edition of the ongoing series to be presented to the public as a vinyl LP as well as compact disc and digital form. Vol. 3's retail release date of February 28, 2012 marked the 5th collaborative work from the trio and the 3rd of the self-titled series. The third installment was completed as a split release between Central Standard Records and Galapagos4. Joining the likes of Qwel & Maker, Typical Cats, Qwazaar & Batsauce and various other underground rap and hip hop production veterans, Maxilla's most recent work is again presented in the 3 aforementioned formats.

Kennedy (born February 9, 1953) is a Democratic Party politician who is serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly representing the 22nd Legislative District since January 2016. He previously served as Mayor of Rahway, New Jersey from 1991 through 2010, when he declined to seek a sixth term.  Early Life  Kennedy won his first nomination in the 1990 Democratic primary election, when he contested the re-election for Daniel Martin, who at the time had been mayor for 20 years. Kennedy owns a local store, Kennedy Jewelers, that was adversely affected by the decline of the city's downtown area during the 1970s and 1980s, and he was president of the Rahway Chamber of Commerce during the later 80s. While serving on the board of trustees for the Rahway YMCA, Kennedy befriended Jim McGreevey, a lawyer then residing in neighboring Woodbridge who would ultimately become New Jersey's governor. After McGreevey became governor, Kennedy joined a State Street Partners, a Trenton lobbying firm founded by Rocco F. Iossa, a former aide to Republican Congressman Dennis Gallo and counselor to GOP Governor Christine Todd Whitman. After McGreevey resigned Kennedy started a business, Skye Consulting L.L.C., which has assisted local governments, redevelopment contractors and a foreign- owned water treatment and waste management utility company. Skye Consulting has been hired by local government officials in Burlington, Bound Brook, Mount Laurel, and other New Jersey communities. Kennedy has advocated privatization of municipal assets at the World Water Forum in Mexico City, Istanbul, and Marseille.

Built in 1916-17 by a prosperous farmer, it is a fine local example of Colonial Revival architecture and a reminder of a period of prosperity in Aroostook County. It is home to the Northern Maine Development Commission; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1982, and delisted in 2015. Description and history The McElwain House is located at the northwest corner of Main Street and West Presque Isle Road, in a rural setting on the south side of Caribou. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a truncated hip roof topped by a widows walk. It is finished in clapboard siding, and has an ell extending to the rear that joins it to a carriage house. The east-facing front has a broad single-story porch, supported by paired square posts, extending across the front and along the south side, ending in a porte-cochere. A large hooded dormer pierces the front roof-line, with a similarly-styled dormer to the south. Most of the windows in the house are diamond-paned, either casement or sash windows. Its interiors are richly crafted, with Tiffany glass in the cabinets, and handcrafted stone fireplaces. The house was built in 1916-17 by John McElwain, one of the county's most successful and prosperous farmers, and included all sorts of amenities more typical for Maine's even more elaborate coastal summer houses. The McElwains were a significant social force in the area, hosting parties and other events at the house. Their fortunes declined with the advent of the Great Depression, and they converted the grand ballroom to guest rooms to make ends meet. Since 1973 the house has been used as the headquarters of the Northern Maine Development Commission, which has carefully maintained its interior and exterior.

Legal challenges Donald Spencer helped his wife, Marian, integrate Coney Island, Cincinnati, Ohio in 1952 through a lawsuit in which she was the plaintiff. In 2004, Donald Spencer and his wife, Marian Spencer, initiated litigation seeking to restrain Defendants J. Kenneth Blackwell, in his official capacity as the Secretary of State of Ohio, Intervenor Defendant State of Ohio, the Hamilton County Board of Elections and its Chair Timothy Burke and members Michael Barrett, Todd Ward, Daniel Radford and Director John Williams in their official capacities from discriminating against black voters in Hamilton County, Ohio on the basis of race. The Spencers sought to restrain the Defendants from allowing challengers at the polls in Hamilton County. Donald and Marian Spencer resided in Avondale, Cincinnati, a predominantly African American neighborhood. The Spencers were legally registered African American voters who voted in ward 13; precinct H. Marian Spencer estimated that one hundred percent of the voters in her precinct were African American. The Spencers alleged that the Hamilton County Board of Elections and the Hamilton County Republican Party combined to implement a voter challenge system at the polls on Election Day that discriminated against African American voters. The United States District Court For The Southern District Of Ohio Western Division granted the Spencers' motion for a temporary restraining order. US District Court Judge Susan J. Dlott, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1995, ruled against the Republican plan, noting that there is no need to have voter challengers since Ohio already requires the presence of election judges at precincts in order to avoid voter fraud. Dlott warned in her decision that the Republican plan, if permitted, could cause \\"chaos, delay, intimidation and pandemonium inside the polls and in the lines outside the door.\\"History Commons website She noted \\"that 14 percent of new voters in a majority white location will face a challenger‚Ä¶ but 97 percent of new voters in a majority African American voting location will see such a challenger.\\" Dlott also said that the law permitting challengers did not sufficiently protect citizens‚Äô fundamental right to vote. The Spencers were represented by Cincinnati attorney Alphonse Gerhardstein. Legacy Donald Spencer was a respected friend of prominent Black Cincinnatians Cincinnati Mayor Theodore M.

Course  The Rh√ºnda rises in the northern foothills of the Kn√ºllgebirge. Its source is in the village of Dickershausen, part of the town of Homberg (Efze), at above sea level. Initially the Rh√ºnda flows northeastward through Sipperhausen and then after turns away from the St√∂pplingskopf, towards north-northwest. In this direction it flows through, approximately parallel to the Bundesautobahn 7 to the east, Ostheim, then flows west past the Geschellenberg hill () and then just to the east of the town of Mosheim. The river meets a small stream close to Hilgershausen then flows southwest down to Helmshausen. After passing a mill, and two basalt quarries, the Rh√ºnda reaches the Felsberg district of Rh√ºnda, after it crosses under Bundesstra√üe 253, just before reaching the Main‚ÄìWeser Railway at about above sea level. There it opens into the River Schwalm, which, in turn, just after passing again under the railway line, flows in the River Eder.

It is a left tributary of the Lahn in the Vorderer Vogelsberg region. It rises in Saasen and after 24.3 kilometres, flows into the Lahn at Giessen, near the railway station. The Giessen suburb of Wieseck is named after the river.  Natural geography and use  The Wieseck valley roughly forms the southern boundary of the Lumda Plateau, the central plateau of the Vorderer Vogelsberg. The Wieseck meadows between Gro√üen-Buseck and the centre of Giessen are a popular recreation area for the people of Giessen. Water quality The saprobic index in the middle reaches of the Wieseck (at Gro√üen-Buseck) is 1.77 which is considered \\"good\\" according to the WFD standards. In the lower reaches, within the urban area, it is 2.34, which is classified as \\"moderate\\". The structural condition, however, should be classified as \\"poor\\". Morphologically, large sections of the Wieseck are severely impaired. Almost 96% of the sections were \\"significantly distorted\\" or worse. Only about 4% were classified as having moderate levels of distortion or better, which is the target. Several other indices calculated by evaluating the colonization of the Wieseck with aquatic organisms (macrobenthos), confirm this poor condition. These values, which indicate structural impairment of the river, show that the middle reaches of the Wieseck at Gro√üen-Buseck are \\"unsatisfactory\\", and the lower reaches in the urban area are \\"poor\\". Thus, on the basis of the WFD, which requires a \\"good ecological condition\\" by 2015, action is necessary to improve the condition of the river. Such action is envisaged in the coming years.

In 2014, his 2012 Tour of Britain win was stripped following the identification of anomalies in his biological passport data from around the time of that race, and he was banned from competition until the end of 2015.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tiernan-locke-retires-from-cycling Amateur career Tiernan-Locke started mountain bike racing at the age of 15 before taking up road racing in 2003 when he was 18. He progressed rapidly from 4th Category to 1st Category in a matter of months and for 2004 was offered the chance to ride for the French Amateur team U.V. Aube. Within 18 months he was selected for the British U23 National team, competing in the Under-23 road race at the 2004 UCI Road World Championships in Verona, Italy, and joined the French team CC √âtupes for 2005. His impact was immediate, with a win in GP de Rocheville, and podiums on all ten of his first ten races. Months later his health deteriorated and he was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus. Forced to stop racing altogether, he spent the next three years studying for a degree in product design at the University of the West of England, but did not graduate. After recovering his health he started racing again in 2008 but his season was once more disrupted after he was knocked off his bike by a horse while competing in a Surrey League race and suffered injuries including a broken collarbone and nose. In 2009 he finally got the chance to return to the pro ranks with the Plowman Craven-Madison team, but once again misfortune struck as the team folded mid season and Jonathan returned to working in a bike shop. Professional career =2011: Rapha Condor-Sharp= In 2010 he was offered the opportunity to ride with for the 2011 season. He won the mountains classification and finished fifth in the general classification in the Tour of Britain. =2012: Endura Racing= Tiernan-Locke in the leader's jersey at the 2012 Tour of Britain. He was later stripped of the title over bio-passport irregularities Tiernan-Locke moved to for the 2012 season. At the start of the year he won the Tour M√©diterran√©en, and the Tour du Haut Var, with those results gaining him the lead of the UCI Europe Tour. Tiernan-Locke later placed second to 's Nairo Quintana in the Vuelta a Murcia. He suffered a fractured collarbone at the Lincoln Grand Prix in May, but returned to cycling at June's Route du Sud, finishing 22nd overall. In July he won the Tour Alsace overall as well as two stages during the event. Tiernan-Locke led Endura at his home race, the Tour of Britain. He finished second on stage six, to Caerphilly mountain, to take the lead of the race. He held the lead until the end of the race, becoming the first British rider to win a British cycling tour since 1993. Tiernan-Locke represented Great Britain at the road world championships finishing 19th. He further enhanced his reputation by staying in contention with the world class field until the final climb.Report: Tiernan Locke Impresses on Worlds Debut. Britishcycling.org.uk (23 September 2012). Retrieved on 13 August 2013. On 4 October 2012, it was announced that Tiernan-Locke would join UCI ProTeam on a two-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. =2013‚Äì2014: Team Sky= Tiernan-Locke riding for at the 2013 Paris‚ÄìNice Tiernan-Locke withdrew from the road world championships on 29 September 2013 because of a potential discrepancy in his biological passport data. He was suspended from racing for Team Sky or taking part in any training activities until he had faced an anti- doping hearing. In July 2014, his ban was announced by the UCI, banning him until 31 December 2015 and stripping his 2012 Tour of Britain and World Championship results. Team Sky immediately terminated his contract. In August 2014, UK Anti-Doping upheld the ban, accepting Tiernan-Locke's claim that he had indulged in binge drinking two days before the positive test but rejecting his contention that he had not rehydrated by the time of the test, given that he was tested on the eve of the 2012 World Championship road race, where he finished 19th. Tiernan-Locke subsequently expressed an interest in returning to professional cycling after the end of his ban. =2016: return to competition= In January 2016, following the end of his ban, Tiernan-Locke indicated that he would return to racing as an independent, rather than with a team. He subsequently expressed dissatisfaction with being awarded a second- category racing licence for his return to competition, after having raced with an elite-level licence from 2003 until his ban. Tiernan-Locke later confirmed that he would ride for the Saint Piran team, which he had co-founded. He finished second on his return to racing in the Primavera Road Race in February 2016, and subsequently won the Modbury Spring Road Race in March. In April 2016, he told Cycling Weekly that \\"I'm realistic that it's a hobby these days, I'm getting by on 10 hours a week training.

M√ºhlbach  The Auer has ten tributaries and flows through the Bensheim district of Hochst√§dten, past the Marble factory and the through the valley M√ºhltal towards Bensheim-Auerbach. In the past, there were seven mills in the M√ºhltal powered by the Auer's water. Therefore here the brook's vernacular name is M√ºhlbach (mill brook). The mill in the village's center is nowadays a wine restaurant, another mill is a nursing home, and another mill is the studio and residential house of an Auerbach-based artist.

Towards the end of the clearing, it picks up the Schmittgraben from the south and then turns north in the direction of its flow, traverses Heusenstamm, passes the Heusenstammer Schloss and then passes under the crossing A 3. It enters in approximate parallel to the S-Bahn for another forest-and-field section of the Strut√§ckern in the Offenbach district of Bieber and turns into it to the northeast. Then Bieber runs from the upper mill underground in a tube and only appears again at the corridor boundary of the place to daylight. After passing under the B 448, it passes through the Feldmark at the cheese mill and accompanied by a wide meadow strip through the forest east of Offenbach. Behind it touches the residential area Markwald of M√ºhlheim and then flows a little north of it from the left and southwest opposite the Henningweg in the Rodau, which flows into the Main after about a final kilometer Nordlauf then soon.

It is a right tributary of the Lahn which in turn is a right tributary of the Rhine. The Elbbach starts near Westerburg in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and flows into the Lahn near Limburg an der Lahn in the state of Hesse. The drainage basin of this river has an area of . History Saint Wendilin Bridge In the nineteenth century, many mills used the water power of the Elbbach. They included grain mills, an ironworks in Berzhahn and also an oil mill in Niederhadamar.Zedlitz-Neukirch, Leopold von. Neues hydrographisches Lexikon f√ºr die deutschen Staaten, p. 97 (Berlin, 1832). In the twentieth century, the economic importance of this river greatly diminished. However, many micro hydro plants are now running on the Elbbach, especially around Hadamar. Some of them are at the sites of the old mills.‚Äú‚ÄòElse‚Äô holt 15 Kilowatt aus dem Elbbach‚Äù, Frankfurter Neue Presse (May 29, 2015). There are many bridges across this river, some of them extremely old. These include the Saint Wendilin Bridge in Niederhadamar, built in the 12th century, which is one of Germany‚Äôs medieval bridges and may be the oldest in the state of Hesse. =Etymology= The first part of the name ‚ÄúElbbach‚Äù has an etymology like that of the Elbe, a major river in Central Europe whose name derived from the Latin ' meaning ‚Äúriver‚Äù. And, the German word for ‚Äústream‚Äù is ‚Äúbach‚Äù, a common suffix for German rivers.Orel, Vladimir. A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 13 Route Weaving its way through WillmenrodThe Elbbach arises in the Rhineland-Palatinate part of the Westerwald, a few miles northwest of Westerburg, from the convergence of several streams north of Ailertchen. From there, it flows south to Kaden, east past Guckheim, through Willmenrod and then to Langendernbach in Hesse. Continuing south, the Elbbach reaches Elbtal (named after the river) and then Hadamar. Then this river flows further south at Staffel, which is a district of Limburg an der Lahn. On average, this river supplies about four cubic meters per second (4 m¬≥/s) into the Lahn. =Nature preserves= In the latter part of its route, through the state of Hesse, the Elbbach flows through the nature reserve \\"Elbbachtal\\". This protected area follows the course of the river over approximately from the state border to the city of Hadamar. The boundary of the reserve is usually close to the river, which means that the reserve covers only despite its long distance. The official short description and justification of this protected area is: \\"Near- natural watercourses with brook-riparian riparian forests, high-altitude meadows, wet meadows, freshwater meadows, reedbeds and floodplains. Vegetation valuable from both botanical and faunistic point of view, habitat of numerous rare and endangered species of flora and fauna, of particular importance for running waters, locally significant bird breeding area.\\" Further along this river‚Äôs course is the nature reserve \\"Kalksteinbruch bei Hadamar\\" comprising , and the area \\"Elbbachaue east of Elz\\" comprising . The latter area consists of two sub-areas of wet meadow, which is particularly important because of the occurrence of the dark and the light-colored butterfly called the Scarce large blue.

For most of its upper course it forms the boundary between the districts of Diepholz and Vechta and for a shorter distance along its lower reaches it forms the boundary between the town of Diepholz and the collective municipality of Barnstorf.  Course  The Dadau has its source in the Diepholz Moor Depression in the S√ºdlohn Moor near the town of Lohne. Then it flows northwards between the S√ºdlohn and Br√§gel Moors to the west and the Aschen Moor to the east and then turns to head east at the boundary between Lohne and Vechta on its left bank. Beyond the B 69 federal road, the Dadau flows in an easterly, and sometimes south- easterly, direction. In its final section it runs through (upstream its right bank belongs to Diepholz) the municipal area of Drebber. The Dadau joins the Hunte a few metres east of the B 51 in Cornau, a part of Drebber. The Hunte carries on flowing northwards towards Oldenburg. Between the Hunte and the Dadau is Deckau, also a part of Drebber. In 2003, the towns of Vechta and Diepholz as well as the municipal area of Drebber decided to align their boundaries with the current route of the Dadau. In 2004, the administrative districts which would have been affected, agreed to this change of their borders. Altogether Diepholz was increased in size by 0.8323 ha (8323sq mi) at Vechta's expense.Landkreis Diepholz: Vorlage 115/2004 f√ºr die Kreistagssitzung am 25. Oktober 2004  Historical significance  Near the mouth of the Dadau, the water castle of Cornau, the castle of the district Diepholz as part of the Holy Roman Empire, was located between the Dadau and the Hunte, from where the area was ruled up until the castle in Diepholz was constructed. There was a moat to the west of the castle Cornau, which closed the gap between Dadau and Hunte. The rest of the moat was filled up in 1962. The castle has been falling into ruin since the 15th century. Until 1751 its remains were removed.Stefan Mehrholz: Die Burg The Dadau has since Reformation Times been marking the border of areas with a predominantly Roman Catholic population from other areas with a predominantly Evangelical, Lutheran population. To the west of this border lay the Niederstift M√ºnster, the Free State of Oldenburg with the region of Oldenburger M√ºnsterland as well as the Regierungsbezirk Weser-Ems in Lower Saxony. To the east of the border is the district of Diepholz, The Kingdom of Hanover, The Kingdom of Prussia as well as the Regierungsbezirk Hannover in Lower Saxony.  Nature reserves  The Dadau cross and borders the nature reserves of S√ºdlohner Moor, Aschener Moor/Heeder Moor, Boller Moor and Lange Lohe, it touches the natural reserve of Drebbersches Moor.  Water quality  In 2004 the Dadau's and adjacent streams' water quality were valued negatively by qualified public authorities in Lower Saxony: \\"The organically and sand-filled lowland streams of the western Duemmer's depression were graded as moderate to unsatisfactory. Fastidious organisms, who could indicate a good condition, were hard to find. A relatively high amount of moors were run through [by affected streams]. Due to mostly intensive drainage of the moor areas, the waters are more or less influenced by swamp water. The released swamp-like substances from humans have led to high organic charges of the waters. Iron and nutrients have been released to a considerable extent and have led to eutrophication of consumptive oxide degradation processes and sapropel formations. This process will be benefited by minor shading and reducing the flow rate through jams and pipe colverts.\\"Bezirksregierung Weser- Ems / Nieders√§chsischer Landesbetrieb f√ºr Wasserwirtschaft, K√ºsten- und Naturschutz (NLWKN): Bestandsaufnahme zur Umsetzung der EG- Wasserrahmenrichtlinie Oberfl√§chengew√§sser.

It is fed by lateral sources and by the humidity of the wetland it passes. The western part of this waterway is an affluent of river Ilse, part of Weser bassin, the eastern part an affluent of river Bode, part of Elbe bassin. The top, almost without flow, is a pseudo-bifurcation and part of the section called Schiffgraben. The border between the names Gro√üer Graben and Schiffgraben is situated east of the pseudo-bifurcation. The names Gro√üer Graben (Large Canal) and Schiffgraben (Ship Canal) are due to the fact that in old ages it was intended to use them as a waterway.

Its first part was in Ramadan 2010, the series was stopped in its middle, because Ahmed Mekky had broken his leg, and had to stay at home for a month, the series was continued in the name of El Kabeer Awi 2, and it was released in Ramadan 2011. Each part was only 15 episodes. A third, fourth and fifth part were released in 2013, 2014 and 2015, then it stopped. Overview The main character of this show is Egyptian comedian and movie star Ahmed Mekky. He plays three characters in this show by changing up his image by the use of wigs and makeup. His first character is the mayor of Al-Mazarita, which is a fake village in Egypt. Earlier in his life, he met an American woman and had twins with her. One child stayed in Egypt while the other went to America (both children are played by Mekky). Once he is on his deathbed, his child that grew up in America goes over to Egypt to claim his father's title. The sons battle to see who will take over, but it is more about which son is deemed the funniest. Hazal'om, another character of one of Mekky's previous movies, is introduced in Season 3 as Al-Kabeer and Johnny's long-lost brother from Abdeen, a small village in Egypt. They eventually get rid of him as he goes to Saudi Arabia to visit his mother who is about to get married. He returns in the Season 3 finale as a millionaire who buys Al-Kabeer and Johnny's house. In Season 4, he explains how he became a millionaire after a project in Tanzania. In the Season 4 finale, another new character is introduced in Na'eem Al- Kabeer Awy, their long lost brother from Sudan who inherits his father's money. In Season 5, he gives Al-Kabeer his father's company in Turkey. While in Turkey, he gets attacked by a gang and gets his passport stolen, losing his memory in the process. After months of trying to get in contact with Al- Kabeer, Hazal'om travels to Turkey to search for him. Meanwhile, Al-Kabeer is taken by an old lady as she lets him stay at her place and gives him a new name in \\"Mohannad\\". While there, he falls in love with a lady named \\"Khoshnaf\\". He begins working for \\"Baba Doblos\\" at his boxing gym, where he cleans the bathroom. One day, he is bullied by a boxer named Roman who challenges him to a match. Al-Kabeer loses and Baba Doblos finds out. He convinces to train him to become a boxer. Meanwhile, Khoshnaf's father finds out that she is in love with Al-Kabeer and threatens to kill him. He says the only way for him to marry his daughter is to defeat Roman. Elsewhere, Hazal'om visits his friend Yuri in order to help him find his brother. There, he meets Sasha, a serial killer who works for Yuri. As Hazal'om and Yuri are discussing business, a man in a metal suit kills Yuri with a sword and runs off. As Yuri is dying, he tells Hazal'om to give Sasha his ring but Hazal'om keeps it for himself, making him the leader of the mafia. After Al-Kabeer finally beats Roman, Hazal'om and his mafia attack. Hazal'om hides while the mafia take care of business. As Hazal'om is hiding, he recognizes Al-Kabeer's voice and saves him from getting shot by Sasha. They both wake up at the hospital and Al- Kabeer gains his memory back, but forgets everything that happened in Turkey. Hazal'om tells him the whole story and says his goodbyes to Sasha while Al- Kabeer says his goodbyes to Khoshnaf. When they go back to Cairo, Al-Kabeer discovers that his wife is an asylum and won't be out till 6 months. In the Season 5 finale, Hazal'om and the gang save the planet from a meteoroid. It is shown in this episode that Hazal'om, Al-Kabeer and Johnny start getting along as Hazal'om and the gang say their goodbyes. However, the final season was filmed in Serbia, and had Lena Bogdanoviƒá as a guest star. This show tries to go after American culture. A few examples of this is cornrows, playing American football, and wearing unmatched clothing. This show started off grabbing people's attention because some of the plot is inspired by characters and stories in Mekky's previous movies.
