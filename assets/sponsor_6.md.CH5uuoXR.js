He obtained his medical doctorate in 1844 with the dissertation, De indole hallucinationum in mania religiosa,ADB: Leubuscher, Rudolf @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie afterwards serving as an assistant to Heinrich Philipp August Damerow (1798-1866) at the newly constructed provincial mental institution in Halle. In 1848 he became habilitated at Humboldt University of Berlin, and in 1855 was a director at the medical clinic in Jena. He later returned to Berlin as a physician and associate professor at the university. He died in Berlin in 1861 at the age of 39. Leubuscher is remembered for his political views, as well as for his work in medicine. He was a catalyst for health reform in Germany, and also a passionate advocate of social and political change. He argued that economic and social conditions were a major factor concerning health and disease, and believed that the health of the populace was a matter of social concern. With Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), he was co-founder of a weekly socio-political newspaper on medical reform called Medicinische Reform. The publication of this newspaper was short-lived; it was only in existence from July 1848 to June 29, 1849. He was close to the L√ºbeck University professor Ernst Freiherr von Blomberg. They both worked in the same fields of expertise and an abundant correspondence between them shows a remarkable kinship. Both published on clinical lycanthropy, Renfield syndrome and other diseases of the brain. Freiherr von Blomberg, an anthrozoologist and theologist, reportedly dedicated his (posthumously published) Ein seltener fall von Hydrocephalus to Leubuscher, although no mention of Leubuscher appears in the paper.  Literary works  Among his written works was a German translation of Louis- Florentin Calmeil's landmark work on the history of psychiatry, De la Folie (About the delusions). Leubuscher named his translation Der Wahnsinn in den vier letzten Jahrhunderten (On madness in the last four centuries). In 1852, he published the late Benno Reinhardt's pathological-anatomical studies. He also published an article on aboulia ('√úber Abulie', Zeitschr. f√ºr Psychiat. 4, 562-578, 1847), listing a number of disorders of the will, such as \\"weak- willedness\\". Other literary works by Leubuscher include: * √úber Wehrw√∂lfe und Thierverwandlungen im Mittelalter. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Psychologie, Berlin 1850 - On werewolves and animal transformations in the Middle Ages. A contribution to the history of psychology. * √úber die Entstehung der Sinnest√§uschung. Ein Beitrag zur Anthropologie, Berlin 1852 - On the origin of illusion.

The protein belongs to the S28E family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.

Nav1.6 is one sodium channel isoform and is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel at the nodes of Ranvier. The channels are highly concentrated in sensory and motor axons in the peripheral nervous system and cluster at the nodes in the central nervous system.  Structure  Nav1.6 is encoded by the SCN8A gene which contains 27 exons and measures 170 kb. The voltage gated sodium channel is composed of 1980 residues. Like other sodium channels, Nav1.6 is a monomer composed of four homologous domains (I-IV) and 25 transmembrane segments. SCN8A encodes S3-S4 transmembrane segments which form an intracellular loop.  Function  Nav1.6 action potentials, shown in blue, demonstrate greater depolarization, higher frequency and longer firing time before depolarization compared to action potentials observed in other sodium channel isoforms, shown in red. Like other sodium ion channels, Nav1.6 facilitates action potential propagation when the membrane potential is depolarized by an influx of Na+ ions. However, Nav1.6 is able to sustain repetitive excitation and firing. The high frequency firing characteristic of Nav1.6 is caused by a persistent and resurgent sodium current. This characteristic is caused by slow activation of the sodium channel following repolarization, which allows a steady-state sodium current after the initial action potential propagation. The steady- state sodium current contributes to the depolarization of the following action potential. Additionally, the activation threshold of Nav1.6 is lower compared to other common sodium channels such as Nav1.2. This feature allows Nav1.6 channels to rapidly recover from inactivation and sustain a high rate of activity. Nav1.6 is expressed primarily in the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons but is also highly concentrated at the distal end of the axon hillock, cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje neurons and to a lower extent in non- myelinated axons and dendrites. Given the location of Nav1.6, the channel contributes to the firing threshold of a given neuron, as the electrical impulses from various inputs are summed at the axon hillock in order to reach firing threshold before propagating down the axon. Other sodium channel isoforms are expressed at the distal end of the axon hillock, including Nav1.1 and Nav1.2. thumb Nav1.6 IQ motif in complex with CaM NaV1.6 channels demonstrate resistance against protein phosphorylation regulation. Sodium channels are modulated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation, which reduce peak sodium currents. Dopamine and acetylcholine decrease sodium currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons through phosphorylation. Similarly, serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex are regulated by PKC in order to reduce sodium currents. Phosphorylated regulation in sodium channels helps to slow inactivation. However, NaV1.6 channels lacks adequate protein kinase sites. Phosphorylation sites at amino acid residues Ser573 and Ser687 are found in other sodium channels but are not well conserved in NaV1.6. The lack of serine residues lead to the channel's ability to consistently and quickly fire following inactivation. NaV1.6 is conversely regulated by Calmodulin (CaM). CaM interacts with the isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) motif of NaV1.6 in order to inactivate the channel. The IQ motif folds into a helix when interacting with CaM and CaM will inactivate NaV1.6 depending on the concentration of calcium. The NaV1.6 IQ demonstrates moderate affinity for CaM compared to other sodium channel isoforms such as NaV1.6. The difference in CaM affinity contributes to NaV1.6's resistance to inactivation.  Clinical significance  The first known mutation in humans was discovered by Krishna Veeramah and Michael Hammer in 2012. The genome of a child demonstrating epileptic encephalopathy was sequenced and revealed a de novo missense mutation, p.Asn1768Asp. The missense mutations in Nav1.6 increased channel function by increasing the duration of the persistent sodium current and prevented complete inactivation following hyperpolarization. 20% of the initial current persisted 100 ms after hyperpolarization resulting in hyperexcitability of the neuron and increasing the likelihood of premature or unintentional firing. In addition to epileptic encephalopathy, the patient presented with developmental delay, autistic features, intellectual disability and ataxia. Sodium channel conversion has been implicated in the demyelination of axons related multiple sclerosis (MS). In early stages of myelination, immature Nav1.2 channels outnumber Nav1.6 in axons. However, mature Nav1.6 channels gradually replace the other channels as myelination continues, allowing increased conduction velocity given the lower threshold of Nav1.6. However, in MS models, sodium channel conversion from mature Nav1.6 to Nav1.2 is observed.

ENaC is assembled as a heterotrimer composed of three homologous subunits Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ or Œ¥, Œ≤, and Œ≥. The other ENAC subunits are encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G. ENaC is expressed in epithelial cells and is different from the voltage-gated sodium channel that is involved in the generation of action potentials in neurons. The abbreviation for the genes encoding for voltage-gated sodium channel starts with three letters: SCN. In contrast to these sodium channels, ENaC is constitutively active and is not voltage-dependent. The second N in the abbreviation (SCNN1D) represents that these are NON-voltage-gated channels. In most vertebrates, sodium ions are the major determinant of the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid. ENaC allows transfer of sodium ions across the epithelial cell membrane in so- called \\"tight-epithelia\\" that have low permeability. The flow of sodium ions across epithelia affects osmolarity of the extracellular fluid. Thus, ENaC plays a central role in the regulation of body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and consequently affects blood pressure. As ENaC is strongly inhibited by amiloride, it is also referred to as an \\"amiloride-sensitive sodium channel\\".  History  The first cDNA encoding the delta subunit of ENaC was cloned and sequenced by Waldmann et al. from human kidney mRNA.  Gene structure  The sequence of the SCNN1D gene was first revealed by the human genome project. SCNN1D is located in the short arm of chromosome 1 (Ensembl database code: ENSG00000162572) and starts at nucleotide 1,280,436 on theg forward strand. Its length is about 11,583 bp. The gene encodes several alternative transcripts with different transcription and translation initiation sites (see Fig. 1 below). In mRNA samples from human brain, alternative splicing products have been detected, cloned and characterized. ffebhe SCNN1D gene is found in most vertebrates. But the gene has been lost in the mouse and rat genomes.  Tissue-specific expression  The tissue specific expression of the Œ¥-subunit is very different from that of the other three subunits encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G. While the Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ subunits are expressed mainly in the kidney tubular epithelia, the respiratory airway, the female reproductive tract, colon, salivary and sweat glands, the Œ¥-subunit is expressed mainly in the brain, pancreas, testis and ovary.  Protein structure  The primary structures of all four ENaC subunits show strong similarity. Thus, these four proteins represent a family of proteins that share a common ancestor. In global alignment (meaning alignments of sequences along their entire length and not just a partial segment), the human Œ¥ subunit shares 34% identity with the Œ± subunit and 23% identity with the Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits. All four ENaC subunit sequences have two hydrophobic stretches that form two transmembrane segments named as TM1 and TM2. In the membrane- bound form, the TM segments are embedded in the membrane bilayer, the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are located inside the cell, and the segment between the two TMs remains outside of the cell as the extracellular region of ENaC. This extracellular region includes about 70% of the residues of each subunit. Thus, in the membrane-bound form, the bulk of each subunit is located outside of the cell. The structure of ENaC has not been yet determined. Yet, the structure of a homologous protein ASIC1 has been resolved. The chicken ASIC1 structure revealed that ASIC1 is assembled as a homotrimer of three identical subunits. The authors of the original study suggested that the ASIC1 trimer resembles a hand holding a ball. Hence distinct domains of ASIC1 have been referred to as palm, knuckle, finger, thumb, and Œ≤-ball. Alignment of ENaC subunit sequences with ASIC1 sequence reveals that TM1 and TM2 segments and palm domain are conserved, and the knuckle, finger and thumb domains have insertions in ENaC. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on ENaC subunits provide evidence that many basic features of the ASIC1 structural model apply to ENaC as well. Yet, ENaC is an obligate heterotrimer composed of three subunits as an Œ±Œ≤Œ≥ or a Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥ trimer.  Associated diseases  So far mutations in the delta subunit have not been associated with a specific disease.

Prior to America's entry into World War II, he served as Assistant Military Attache in England and helped British pilots transition into the P-40. In October 1941, Alison traveled to Moscow to administer the sensitive U.S.-Soviet P-40 Lend-Lease program. He trained Russian pilots in the P-40, A-20, and B-25 Mitchell aircraft.

The book's opening chapter, titled \\"Night Scramble at Hengyang\\" emphasizes how unorthodox were his actions, since the aircraft were not equipped for night flying, nor was the base lit; in addition, the nearby city was under wartime blackout. After downing three enemy aircraft in the darkness over his base, he ditched his damaged aircraft in the Siang River, where it was later salvaged to provide replacement parts for other damaged craft. Alison again demonstrated his aggressiveness in early 1943, when he took off during an attack on his own airfield, engaged three Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, and scored one probable kill. He then vectored arriving reinforcements to the battle, after which he made a stern attack on another enemy fighter at close range, shooting it down.

In 1973 he obtained an MBA from Columbia Business School. Career In 1969, Scaroni joined Chevron Corporation for three years. After obtaining MBA, Scaroni was an associate at McKinsey & Company. In 1973, he joined Saint-Gobain, where he held different positions, culminating with his appointment as president of flat glass division. In 1985, he was appointed CEO of Techint. In 1996, he moved to the United Kingdom to become Chief Executive Officer of Pilkington. From May 2002 to May 2005, he served as CEO of Enel, Italy's leading electricity company. At Enel, Scaroni made a real breakthrough by abandoning the traditional multi-utility corporate model, supported by his predecessor Franco Tat√≤, in favour of placing greater focus on the core energy business. Under his mandate, Enel created a separate wind energy unit and discontinued the roll out of the Enel S√¨ branded franchise. From 2005 to July 2006, he was chairman of Alliance Unichem. He also became the CEO () of Eni in June 2005. He left the role in April 2014. In April 2014, he was found guilty of environmental crimes during his career as the CEO of Enel.

He is a member of the board of overseers of the Columbia Business School. In addition to this, he is in the board of overseers of Fondazione Teatro alla Scala. Political views CEO Paolo Scaroni has never taken political positions supporting one particular party or coalition. He often emphasizes that Italy, unlike other countries in Europe, is a land of oil and gas, resources which are not valued enough, in his opinion, because of myopic political views and populist environmentalism. In November 2008, with reference to the Kyoto Protocol and the climate change package Paolo Scaroni claims: \\"We think that in the short term, with existing technologies and expertise, renewable sources, namely solar and wind, will represent only a small fraction of energy supply. For this reason, at Eni we invest in research, in particular in solar, and we are sure that only a revolutionary technological invention will create renewable resources that can significantly contribute to our energy needs.

It is used to consider an opportunity for a management buyout. Managers are often allowed to invest at a lower valuation to make their ownership possible and to create a personal financial incentive for them to approve the buyout and to work diligently towards the success of the investment. The envy ratio is somewhat similar to the concept of financial leverage; managers can increase returns on their investments by using other investors' money. Basic formula :\\\\mbox{Envy ratio} = {\\\\mbox{Investment by investors / Percent of equity} \\\\over \\\\mbox{Investment by managers / Percent of equity}} Source Example If private equity investors paid $500M for 80% of a company's equity, and a management team paid $60M for 20%, then ER=(500/80)/(60/20)=2.08x. This means that the investors paid for a share 2.08 times more than did the managers. The ratio demonstrates how generous institutional investors are to a management team‚Äîthe higher the ratio is, the better is the deal for management. As a rule of thumb, management should be expected to invest anywhere from six months to one year‚Äôs gross salary to demonstrate commitment and have some personal financial risk.

The protein encoded by this gene is similar to the ubiquitin ligase domain of other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes but lacks the conserved cysteine residue that enables those enzymes to conjugate ubiquitin to the target protein.

The protein attenuates the signaling activity of G-proteins by binding to activated, GTP-bound G alpha subunits and acting as a GTPase activating protein (GAP), increasing the rate of conversion of the GTP to GDP.

Project STAR accepts referrals from offices of mental health and mental retardation, child welfare agencies, and families who choose to refer themselves. Project PACT (Parents and Children Together) was created by Project STAR to maintain contact open between children temporarily removed from their homes and their birth parents. Visits are set up by staff at a supervised, neutral location. Parenting lessons are provided with each visit, and parents and welfare professionals are given feedback following each visit.\\"Family Preservation Services\\", amazingkids.org.

It is privately funded, as an academy and was granted dual specialty status in late 2004, adding Humanities to its well established Language College status. Mrs Gabbi is the current principal. The school received a good review from OFSTED in January 2019. Montsaye is also the site of the recently developed Rothwell Swimming Pool, which now incorporates a modern sports centre used by the community as well as the school.http://www.kettering.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=142 : The pupils who attend the school are aged 11‚Äì18 (year 7-13) and come mainly from Desborough and Rothwell, as well as surrounding villages. The school had around 1274 students and around 100 members of staff as of 2009. History Initially, the school was opened in 1955, but the older buildings have been extensively remodelled and developed. Since becoming a comprehensive school in 1976, Montsaye has more than doubled in size and has had a series of major building extensions. In 2004/05, extensive building work took place which has provided additional teaching areas for Mathematics and Science, an I.C.T suite, refurbished administrative accommodation and a visitor reception area. In addition, the sixth form area was remodelled in order to provide a purpose built educational support centre, new laboratories and an extension to the library to provide study facilities and a resource base. More recently, a major project funded by the Big Lottery has provided the college and community with a sports facility consisting of four badminton courts, a sports hall and a refurbished swimming pool. In 2011 a new block costing ¬£6 million was constructed to the north of the school to cater for engineering diploma students. However, it was not possible to be used for this purpose and is now the sixth form centre, as well as containing a gym for school and public use. The original sixth form location has now been converted into an extra music classroom and a new canteen. The college was granted Language College status in September 2000 and in addition, in September 2004, was also granted Humanities College status as a second specialism. In 2007, the school was granted a Vocational College Status as its third status. In 2009, the main school website went under construction and has now changed. The new and improved website provides a more clear, structured mass of information including virtual tours of some classrooms. On 1 August 2011 the college was converted to an Academy. Prior to this conversion, the school was known as \\"Montsaye Community College\\".

It induces apoptosis, a special type of cell death. Currently, the precise function of Bok in this process is unknown.  Discovery and homology  In 1997, the protein Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (Bok) was identified in a yeast two- hybrid experiment with a rat ovarian cDNA library in a screen for proteins interacting with Mcl-1, an abundant anti-apoptotic protein. The overexpression of Bok induces apoptosis. Because of its high sequence similarity to Bak and Bax, Bok is classified as a member of the Bcl-2 protein family. The mouse homologue of Bok is called Matador (Mtd). This name is derived from the Latin term mactator which means butcher or killer. Additionally, homologous proteins were found in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Gallus gallus (chicken).  Promoter and gene structure  The human BOK promoter is activated by the overexpression of members of the E2F hand transcription factor family. Typically, these transcription factors are involved in the promotion of S-phase, so there might be a connection between Bok expression and cell cycle progression. Due to this regulation of Bok expression by the cell cycle, it was proposed that Bok sensitizes growing cells to stress-induced apoptosis. Bok mRNA comprises five exons which code for a 213 amino acid protein, called Bok-L. This protein consists of four Bcl-2 homology domains (abbreviated BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4, respectively) and a C-terminal transmembrane region (Figure 1). Its BH3 domain contains a stretch with many leucine residues. This is unique among the Bcl-2 family members. The leucine-rich stretch functions as a nuclear export signal. It is recognized by the nuclear exportin Crm1. Mutations in the leucine-rich stretch impair the binding of Crm1 to Bok. Consequently, Bok accumulates in the nucleus and triggers apoptosis.  Splice variants  Due to alternative splicing, Bok mRNA gives rise to different Bok proteins: Figure 1 illustrates the different splice variants schematically. Full length Bok is named Bok-L. Figure 1: Splice variants of Bok mRNA and the resulting proteins. Bok mRNA comprises five exons and two alternative start codons for translation (AUG). Exons are visualized as arrows and boxes in different colors; ovals indicate sequences that code for Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4) or the transmembrane domain (TM). In the Bok-S variant, the BH3 domain is truncated and fused to the shortened BH1 domain. Another known variant, Bok-P, lacks the BH4 domain and contains a truncated BH3 domain. The shorter version, Bok-S, lacks exon 3. This results in a fusion of the BH3 domain with the BH1 domain. The BH3 domain is involved in the interaction of Bok with Mcl-1 and other molecules. It is dispensable for the induction of apoptosis. Expression of Bok-S may be an immediate response to stress signals. It has been shown to induce apoptosis regardless of the presence of anti-apoptotic molecules. Another splice variant termed Bok-P was found in placental tissue from patients suffering from pre-eclampsia. While Bok-S misses exon 3, Bok-P lacks exon 2. This deletion includes the BH4 domain and parts of the BH3 domain. Bok-P may be the cause for trophoblast cell death in pre-eclampsia, a dangerous pregnancy complication. In pre-eclampsia, typical alterations occur in the maternal kidney and lead to hypertension and proteins in the urine. To date, the cause of this medical condition as well as an appropriate treatment have not been discovered.  Expression pattern  The Bok gene is activated and produces protein in different tissues. In mice, elevated Bok levels were detected in the ovary, the testis, and the uterus. Nevertheless, it also exists in the brain and at low levels in most other tissues. However, the expression pattern of the Bok gene varies among species. In humans, Bok is found in a wide range of tissues. The gene is expressed in the colon, the stomach, the testes, the placenta, the pancreas, the ovaries, and the uterus. Furthermore, more Bok is expressed in fetal tissue compared to adult tissue. Thus, Bok may influence development.  Subcellular localization  The subcellular localization of Bok protein is controversial. In proliferating cells, Bok is found in the nucleus. Upon induction of apoptosis, it was found to tightly associate with mitochondrial membranes. On the other hand, another group found Bok shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In their experiments, increased nuclear (not mitochondrial) localization correlated with a stronger apoptotic activity.  Regulation  It was found that the cellular ratio of pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members effects late apoptotic events such as release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of caspases. Higher levels of pro-apoptotic proteins compared to anti-apoptotic proteins seem to cause apoptosis. In a current model, the formation of heterodimers between pro-apoptotic and anti- apoptotic proteins prevents induction of apoptosis.  Interactions  The binding of Bok to its interacting partners seems to be mediated by its BH3 domain. The splice variant Bok-S lacks this domain and is unable to form heterodimers with other proteins of the Bcl-2 family. In yeast two-hybrid experiments, Bok was found to interact with the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, BHRF-1, and Bfl-1. However, interactions with other anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w were not detectable (1). Later studies aimed at confirming an interaction between Bok and pro-apoptotic Bak or Bax but were not successful. Accordingly, coexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 suppresses apoptosis induced by Bok overexpression. Consistent with the results mentioned above, coexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 does not prevent Bok-induced apoptosis.  Knock-out mouse  Since its discovery in 1997, several attempts have been made to characterize Bok. Due to the increased expression levels in fetal tissue, scientists anticipated a developmental role for Bok. Recently, the Bok knock-out mouse was created. This mouse shows, however, no developmental defects and normal fertility. This finding indicates that the function of Bok seems to overlap with the function of the related pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax. Several other roles were proposed for Bok, especially in developing cells. Since the action of Bok in triggering apoptosis seems to be redundant, it is difficult to assign a specific role to Bok in the presence of Bak and Bax. The study of cells deficient in Bak and Bok or deficient in Bax and Bok, respectively, could help to better characterize the role of Bok in apoptosis. If Bok exerts a critical function, it is likely that this function is limited to certain circumstances, e.g. specific cell types, stress conditions. Thus, these aspects should be assessed in more detail to analyze the physiological and pathological role of Bok.

An Unusual Path to Big-Time Trading - New York Times Early life Born in Kobe, Japan, Iguchi moved to the U.S. at age 19 to spend a few months with his father who was living in New York whilst temporarily on business. Enchanted with America, he decided to go to college there and enrolled in Southwest Missouri State College (now called Missouri State University) where he majored in psychology. Case Study - Daiwa He married, and worked as a truck salesman at a local Chevrolet dealer during his college years. Career After graduating, he was hired at Daiwa's New York branch to work in the Securities Custody Department. In 1980, he was also given the role of a portfolio manager. () In 1983, he lost $70,000 trading Federal Reserve Notes (FRN) but concealed this loss to protect his reputation and job. He continued trading attempting to recoup the loss; however, the loss snowballed.I didn't set out to rob a bank - Time Magazine Meanwhile, the Securities Custody Department expanded to the largest department of Daiwa's New York Branch as the Japanese investment in U.S. securities soared. Iguchi's area was producing more than 50% of the Branch's profits. While he was managing the fastest growing division of Daiwa's international division, his clandestine trading operation escalated to recoup ever deepening losses. In July 1989, Iguchi and his two junior traders made a $3 billion bet on U.S. Treasury Bonds and lost $350 million. Immediately after this incident, as a result of whistle-blowing by one of the dealers, the New York Fed sent an examiner to look into Daiwa‚Äôs bond trading operation, but found nothing. In 1991, the downtown Securities Custody Department moved to the World Financial Center with a new trading room. It was a bold move because the downtown office was approved by New York State Banking Department as a custody operation center only. Shortly after, Iguchi was promoted to Executive Vice President of the New York Branch. In 1992, during a New York Fed examination, Daiwa concealed the trading operation in its downtown office from the examiners by relocating the bond traders to the Branch‚Äôs main office in midtown. In 1993, on the advice of its lawyers, Daiwa voluntarily confessed to its falsehood and assured the Fed it was not concealing any impropriety. The Fed conducted a thorough investigation of the operation of the downtown office for two weeks but found nothing unusual. After six months of deliberations at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, Daiwa received a formal reprimand for their trickery. It said, > \\"Daiwa engineered trickery in hopes of deceiving the Fed examiner and made > false statements. Daiwa‚Äôs act is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1005. The Federal > Reserve Board hereby requests the management of Daiwa here and in Japan > never to engage in this sort of unethical conduct again.\\" The Ministry of Finance in Japan dispatched a group of examiners to check the Daiwa New York Branch following this news, but found no irregularities. Despite this incident, both the New York Fed and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the highest regulatory authorities in the US and Japan, could not detect Iguchi‚Äôs more than $1 billion loss. In September 1995, fearing the damage his losses may cause the bank if inadvertently discovered, Iguchi wrote a confession letter to the president of Daiwa Bank, Japan, describing what had transpired with the complete details of all the unauthorized trades he had done during the previous 12 years. By this time, the losses were in excess of $1 billion. According to Iguchi, concealing this loss to protect his reputation and job was the impetus for his subsequent unauthorized trading. Upon receiving this confession letter, Daiwa instructed Iguchi to continue concealing the loss and assist other bank officers in verifying the loss. Two weeks later, Daiwa reported the loss to its regulator, the MOF, which instructed Daiwa not to disclose it for two more months as they were scheduled to announce two major bank failures. Japan was in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, following the burst of the economic bubble of the 1980s. However, Daiwa's US lawyers strongly advised Daiwa to report the loss to the US regulators and on September 18, unbeknownst to Iguchi, Daiwa reported the loss and submitted a criminal referral form on Iguchi along with his confession letter. Meanwhile, Iguchi, who was completely kept in the dark, was working day and night to verify the loss, until he was arrested at his home in New Jersey. With his confession letter in the hands of the FBI, Iguchi had no choice but to admit authoring the letter. Imprisonment He was incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City for 15 months, befriending George Harp (a founding member of the Aryan Brotherhood), Greg Scarpa (a Mafia hitman), Abu Marzook (a Hamas leader) and Latin Kings members. During his incarceration, Iguchi penned a memoir of his life in America in Japanese and while he was still imprisoned, the book became a #1 bestseller in Japan. In 1997, he was sentenced to four years in prison and sent to Allenwood Prison Camp (Federal Correctional Institute, Allenwood) to serve the remainder of his term. There he wrote another book about George Harp, the only surviving founding-member of the Aryan Brotherhood, titled King of the Prison, which was published in Japan. In March 1999, he was released from Allenwood FPC. Life after prison In August 2000, Iguchi moved to Atlanta, Georgia to begin his new life as a writer. In April 2001, Iguchi published The Dollar Conspiracy in Japan from Bungeishunju. In May 2002, Iguchi wrote an unpublished book, titled My Billion Dollar Education, an English version of his best-selling book, Confession. An updated version, My Billion Dollar Education: Inside the Mind of a Rogue Trader, was published in April 2014. In July 2007, Iguchi returned to his hometown of Kobe. He works in the area of foreign language education, developing digital solutions using Artificial Intelligence for conversation practice. He continues to write and appear publicly for speaking engagements on the topics of trader psychology, shattering rogue myths, the role of banks and regulators, and how banks can reduce the risk of rogue trading situations. On 29 April 2014 he appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box (Asia) and was interviewed by Bernie Lo and Susan Li to discuss My Billion Dollar Education: Inside the Mind of a Rogue Trader, and the opportunistic corporate culture that facilitates rogue trading situations.

The WD40 group is a large family of proteins, which appear to have a regulatory function. It is believed that the WD40 repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and members of the family are involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly and may play a role in the control of cytotypic differentiation. This encoded protein is found as a subunit in corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) complex along with histone deacetylase 3 protein. This gene is located adjacent to the ocular albinism gene and it is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular albinism with late-onset sensorineural deafness phenotype. This gene is highly similar to the Y chromosome TBL1Y gene.  Interactions  TBL1X has been shown to interact with: * GPS2, and * HDAC3, * NCOA1, and * NCOA2.

Gillies moved on to join Llanelli before signing for Gloucester in 2001/02 and then Warriors in the summer of 2002. Whilst at Gloucester he was a replacement in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol. Gillies - who is the leading appearance maker at Worcester in the modern era after beating the previous record of 222 held by Tony Windo - was a key part of the unbeaten National Division One promotion winning team of 2003/04. The giant lock is widely regarded as one of the best line-out takers in the top-flight and won England A honours in 2000. A leading figure both on and off the field, Gillies made twenty-nine appearances during the 2009/10 campaign ‚Äì more than any other Warrior.

It was one of the first summer \\"cottages\\" constructed in Newport, and is now a National Historic Landmark. It was remodeled and extended by George Champlin Mason and later by Stanford White. It was owned by the King family from 1863 until 1972, when it was given to the Preservation Society of Newport County. History First floor plan George Noble Jones owned the El Destino and Chemonie cotton plantations in Florida. He constructed this house along a farm path known as Bellevue Avenue. It was designed by Richard Upjohn and is an early example of the Gothic Revival style, with an irregular and busy roofline, with many gables and chimneys, and elaborate Gothic detailing. It is built of wood, although it was originally painted beige with sand mixed into the paint, giving it a textured appearance of sandstone. The Jones family permanently left Newport at the outbreak of the American Civil War, and the house was sold to William Henry King in 1864, an Old China Trade merchant. King's nephew David leased the house in 1876 and embarked on a series of alterations. He hired Newport architect George Champlin Mason to build a larger dining room and to build a new service wing, and he had the interior redecorated by the New York firm of Leon Marcotte. He also introduced gas lighting to the premises. In December 1880, David King hired Stanford White of McKim, Mead and White to design a new addition to the house, including new master bedrooms, a nursery, and a new dining room with opalescent glass bricks purchased from Louis Comfort Tiffany. These alterations greatly enlarged upon Upjohn's original design yet retained the fundamental Gothic Revival character of the building. The King family owned the house until 1972, when the last descendant bequeathed it to the Preservation Society. The bequest included all of the furnishings as of about 1880. Today, Kingscote is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) and a contributing property to the Bellevue Avenue Historic District, also an NHL.The Preservation Society of Newport County - Online Ticket Center Gallery Image:Kingscote 01.jpgRichard Upjohn's original 1839 watercolor of Kingscote, as seen from the southwest.

Hetzel is an expert in the field of software testing. He compiled the papers from the 1972 Computer Program Test Methods Symposium, also known as the Chapel Hill Symposium, into the book Program Test Methods. The book, published in 1973, details the problems of software validation and testing. The International Conference and Exposition on Testing Computer Software, which is the first conference with a focus on software testing, is convened in 1984 by the US Professional Development Institute (USPDI) in Washington, D.C. Hetzel and Dr. David Gelperin are the joint program chairs. Hetzel and Dave Gelperin co-found the Software Quality Engineering consultancy firm in 1986. Their motto was, \\"Test, then code.\\" Together they worked to establish software testing as a stand-alone computer discipline. In 1988 they classified the phases and goals of software testing into the following stages: * Until 1956 ‚Äì Debugging Oriented - Until 1956 it was the debugging oriented period, when testing was often associated to debugging: there was no clear difference between testing and debugging. * 1957‚Äì1978 ‚Äì Demonstration Oriented - From 1957‚Äì1978 there was the demonstration oriented period where debugging and testing was distinguished now ‚Äì in this period it was shown, that software satisfies the requirements. * 1979‚Äì1982 ‚Äì Destruction Oriented - The time between 1979‚Äì1982 is announced as the destruction oriented period, where the goal was to find errors. * 1983‚Äì1987 ‚Äì Evaluation Oriented - The years 1983‚Äì1987 are classified as the evaluation oriented period: intention here is that during the software lifecycle a product evaluation is provided and measuring quality. * 1988‚Äì____ ‚Äì Prevention Oriented - From 1988 on it was seen as prevention oriented period where tests were to demonstrate that software satisfies its specification, to detect faults and to prevent faults. In 1988 Gelperin and Heztel write the article The Growth of Software Testing. In it they discuss four major models for software testing. The first two are Phase Models, and the second two are Life Cycle Models. * Demonstration - To make sure that software satisfies its specification * Destruction - To detect implementation faults * Evaluation - To detect requirements, design, and implementation faults * Prevention - To prevent requirements, design, and implementation faults Hetzel's book The Complete Guide to Software Testing which provides methodologies, testing techniques, and the principles of software testing, is released in 1988. The book is released in a 2nd edition later the same year, and several other printings are made through 1994. In 1992 Gelperin and Hetzel firm organized the first \\"Software Testing, Analysis & Review,\\" the \\"STAR\\" conference, in Las Vegas, Nevada and in 1993 introduced a European equivalent, the EuroSTAR Conference. The US-based conferences are now produced by TechWell Corporation which is the new name for their Software Quality Engineering company. Gelperin and Hetzel developed the STEP methodology for implementing the original IEEE-829-1998 Standard for Software and System Test Documentation. Their firm was instrumental in gaining recognition for testing as a separate discipline within the software industry.

He entered the Society of Jesus in Rome on October 30, 1836, and studied at the Roman College (now Pontifical Gregorian University) where he followed the courses of Rev. Vincent Caraffa, the professor of mathematics. He was appointed assistant to Rev. Francesco de Vico, director of the Vatican Observatory. Sestini was ordained in 1844, and then held the chair of higher mathematics at the Roman College. He published a work of astronomy called Catalogue of Star-Colors in his Memoirs of the Roman College, 1845 and 1847. The second memoir includes the first, and forms the entire catalogue, except the twelve celestial charts that accompanied the first. The Revolution of 1848 caused him to flee Rome. The second memoir was in the printer's hands then and the revolution prevented completion of the work. The colour catalogue is the first general review of the heavens for star-colours, from the North Pole to 30 degrees south of the Equator. Sestini went the United States and lived mainly at Georgetown College for twenty years. From 1848 until his retirement 1884, Sestini was intensely engaged in teaching mathematics to the Jesuit scholastics. He published a series of textbooks on algebra, geometry and trigonometry, analytical geometry, and calculus. He wrote treatises on natural science for the use of his pupils; some of these were lithographed and others were privately printed at Woodstock: Theoretical Mechanics in 1873; Animal Physics in 1874; and Principles of Cosmography in 1878. At Georgetown Observatory, in 1850, Sestini made a series of sunspot drawings, which were engraved and published (44 plates) as \\"Appendix A\\" of the Naval Observatory volume for 1847, printed in 1853. The work was republished in 1898. Sestini was the architect of St. Aloysius Church, Washington, DC, which opened in 1859. Around 1869 Sestini collaborated with John Rudolph Niernsee on the architectural plans for Building 1 of the new Jesuit scholasticate (college) in Woodstock, Maryland.Maryland Historical Trust Determination of Eligibility for Woodstock College, 2012 He moved to the college when it opened in 1869 and stayed there until 1884. Sestini founded the American Messenger of the Sacred Heart in 1866, and retained editorial control of it until 1885; during these years he was also head director of the Apostleship of Prayer in the United States. He had many difficulties to contend with in launching and sustaining the \\"Messenger\\", and in directing the League of the Sacred Heart. His last astronomical work was from his observations of the total eclipse of July 29, 1878, in Denver, Colorado. A sketch of the corona as it appeared to him was published in the Catholic Quarterly Review. Because his health was declining, he was transferred in 1885 to the novitiate in Frederick, Maryland, where paralysis eventually ended his career. He died there on January 17, 1890.

The river Aveto runs through the valley, to later join its waters with those of the Trebbia near the hamlet of Confiente. The upper, Ligurian part of the valley comprises the Comuni of Rezzoaglio and Santo Stefano d'Aveto; the lower, Emilian part of the valley is divided between Ferriere, Cerignale and Corte Brugnatella. Verdant and lush, characterized by pleasant sights, fresh and balmy summers and abundant snow in winter, the valley is flanked by forested mountains, culminating at the elevation of 1799 meters with Monte Maggiorasca. History In Roman times, the local inhabitants, the Iluates and Veleiates Ligures, gave more than a headache to the Latin powerhouse: Titus Livy and consul Gneus Fabricius had words of appraisal for their fighting qualities. The Veleiates were eventually subjugated after suffering defeat near Monte Penna at the hands of consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 166 a.C.. The heathen Ligurians venerated that very mountain as a deity, and the forests at its foothills were deemed to be sacred ground. During the High Middle Ages, the valley welcomed a community of friars, who went on to build an important monastery located at Villa Cella and quoted in written documents of the Lombard epoch. Up to the Middle Ages, a lake occupied the plain now known as la Moglia near the hamlet of Cabanne. It was the monks of Villa Cella that, working hard, opened the natural dam that kept the water into the lake and made it run down the valley through the Masappello gorge. In later times, the valley was part of the Malaspina domain: these lords started building the Castle of Santo Stefano d'Aveto. At the end of the 15th century, the Fieschi family acquired the area for the sum of 28,000 livres. After the failure of the Fieschi Plot in Genoa (1547), the Val d'Aveto was assigned to the powerful Doria family. Two major revolts were directed against their domination in the last years of the 18th century, when the territory ended up an integral part of the Republic of Genoa, then of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and eventually of the Kingdom of Italy. During the Second World War, given its difficult terrain, the valley became a fastness of the Italian Resistenza, being mostly spared by the fighting, which took place in nearby areas as Val Fontanabuona and the Sturla and Graveglia valleys. Today, part of the Val d'Aveto is covered by the Aveto Natural Regional Park (Parco Regionale dell'Aveto). The natural reserve of the Agoraie e Moggetto protects the Lago degli Abeti (Fir Lake), on whose bottom fossil fir logs can be seen. =Historical trivia= The Val d'Aveto was the den of brigands; many legends find their origins here. It is said that there was once an inn near the meadow known as Cabrusci√†. The innkeeper was murmured to be used to poison its richest guests; when exposed by the Malaspina lords, he was burnt alive in his inn, whence the name of the place, Ca bruxi√† (Ligurian for Casa bruciata, \\"burnt house\\"). Other sources say this name belongs instead to an old customs house along the road to Borzonasca. The Val d'Aveto had an important guest in the Nobel Prize winner, the writer Ernest Hemingway. During the Second World War, in 1945, he passed through the valley while embedded as war correspondent in the Allied liberation forces. It is said that on his diary he wrote: \\"Today I visited the most beautiful valley in this world\\".Quando Hemingway attravers√≤ la 'Valle degli dei' Be it true or not, Hemingway again visited the area in the 1950s for fishing.La vera storia di Hemingway a pesca in Val d'Aveto  Culture  The Val d'Aveto is part of the culturally homogeneous territory known as the Four Provinces (), straddling the contiguous mountain areas of the Provinces of Alessandria, Genoa, Pavia, Piacenza) and featuring a common tradition and an important repertoire of very ancient music and dances. The main instrument played here is the Apennine pennywhistle, that together with the accordion, and once upon a time by the m√ºsa (Apennine pipes), sets the tune and rhythm for the dances and enlivens the feasts.  Flora and fauna  Liguria is home to the most diverse collection of plant life throughout the whole of Italy. The Val d'Aveto, part of the Ligurian section of the Apennines, is located in a particularly favorable environment for a number of climatical, geographic e geological reasons.Flora della Val d'Aveto Flora della Val d'Aveto (Italian language) The Ligurian Apennine is the border between the fitogeographic regions of Middle Europe and the Mediterranean; it connects the Alpine and peninsular Apennine ranges. For these reasons, plus the noteworthy altitudinal gradient (from about 350 metres asl at the confluence with the Trebbia up to the about 1800 of Monte Maggiorasca) different plant species from diverse environments thrive here. The Ligurian Sea is quite near, furthermore, to the upper part of the valley: some of the summits that surround it, as Monte Ramaceto or Monte Aiona, overlook valleys whose waters run directly into the sea. As for animal life, the Val d'Aveto is still home to several wild species as: badgers, porcupines, foxes, boars, stone martens, wildcats and even wolves. Among the avian species many birds of prey, among which notably the long-eared and little owl, buzzard, and falcons plus many other species, including the cuckoo, finch and thrush, to quote some.

Early years  He was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Career  Paisley is most famous in Western Canada for his contributions to the development of Canadian theatre, most notably as the founder of the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, which he modeled after the Edinburgh Fringe. The festival began in 1982 and was the very first Fringe festival in North America. The alternative theatre concept has since spread and been developed as similar 'Fringes' in major cities across the continent including Vancouver, Toronto, Winnipeg, Boston, and New York. Paisley worked as producer of the Fringe festival in Edmonton for the first ten years of its existence, until 1991, when he left his position to shift his artistic focus from theatre to film. Paisley's feature-length screenplay, Lies Like Truth, won the 2003 CHUM TV Reel Edge competition. Along with a million dollar plus budget for the film itself, a 13-part documentary entitled Good To Go was made to chronicle the development of the project from script to screening. The documentary, which featured Paisley's insight prominently throughout the series, aired nationally in Canada on the A-Channel network. Lies Like Truth premiered at the 2005 Victoria Independent Film & Video Festival. In 2006, Paisley once again tackled event production and worked as producer for the 2006 Victoria Arts Symposium.

In the United States, Nielsen BookScan was sold to The NPD Group in 2017, and the service was renamed NPD BookScan. Elsewhere in the world, Nielsen BookScan continues to operate as an independent service. History Following the success of Nielsen SoundScan which tracked point of sale figures for music, the Nielsen Company decided to launch a similar service for book sales which had been established and was owned by UK based Whitaker & Sons Ltd. Nielsen BookScan was launched in January 2001. Previously, tracking of book sales, such as by the New York Times Best Seller list, was done without raw numbers. The New York Times would survey hundreds of outlets to estimate which books were selling the most copies, and would publish rankings but not figures. Only the publisher of a book tracked how many copies had been sold, but rarely shared this data. BookScan operated under Nielsen in the US until 2016 when it was acquired by The NPD Group from Nielsen‚Äôs U.S. market information and research services for the book industry. In the U.S. the service has been a part of NPD Book since January, 2017. In the rest of the world the BookScan service remains owned by Nielsen. Methodology Nielsen BookScan relies on point of sale data from a number of major book sellers. In 2009 Nielsen BookScan's US Consumer Market Panel covered 75% of retail sales. Use of BookScan BookScan was initially greeted with scepticism, but is now widely used by both the publishing industry and the media. Publishers use the numbers to track the success of their rivals. The media uses the figures as a reference to gauge a title's success. Daniel Gross of Slate has noted the increase of pundits using the figures to disparage each other. BookScan also provided previously unavailable metrics on books published by multiple publishers, such as classic novels in the public domain which may be published by many different houses. Previously, no single entity had figures for the sales of these books; publishers and bookstores only knew their own sales. Slate noted that Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was available from Amazon in 130 different editions; prior to BookScan there was no way to tabulate total sales. By summing BookScan data, however, Pride and Prejudice was reported to command sales of 110,000 a year, nearly 200 years after being published. BookScan records cash register sales of books by tracking ISBNs when a clerk scans the barcode. BookScan only tracks print book sales, thus excluding ebook sales from major e-tailers such as Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, Kobo, Apple, and Google Play. BookScan likewise does not include non-retail sales through channels such as libraries, nor specialty retailers who do not report to the service.https://electricliterature.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about- book-sales-but-were-afraid-to-ask-1fe6bc00aa2d#.jssavzqjs Nielsen offers the BookScan service in 10 territories outside the U.S.: the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Mexico, with Poland next to launch.B√∂rsenblatt f√ºr den deutschen Buchhandel, january 20, 2017 ReferencesFurther reading *.

The standard awards list nominees in each category from which a winner is selected. Twenty-eight Grammys were awarded in the first award ceremony, but the number of awards has grown and fluctuated over time as new categories are added and some older ones removed; at one time, over one hundred awards were given. Special awards There are special awards which are awarded without nominations, typically for achievements of longer than the past year, which the standard awards apply to: * Lifetime Achievement Award is a Special Merit Award presented to performers (and some non-performers through 1972) who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording. * Trustees Award is a Special Merit Award presented to individuals who, during their careers in music, have made significant contributions, other than performance (and some performers through 1983), to the field of recording. * Technical Grammy Award is a Special Merit Award presented to individuals and/or companies who have made contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field. * Grammy Legend Award is a Special Merit Award is presented to individuals or groups for ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field; it was inaugurated in 1990. * Grammy Hall of Fame Award was established in 1973 to honor recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old. Winners are selected annually by a special member committee of eminent and knowledgeable professionals from all branches of the recording arts. * The MusiCares Person of the Year Award was established in 1991 to recognize a musician who has made an outstanding contribution to music and in addition has been active in works of philanthropy. This award is presented by the MusiCares foundation annually. General Field The General Field (also known as the 'Big Four') are four standard awards for musical works which do not restrict nominees by genre or some other criterion: * Album of the Year is awarded to the performer, songwriter(s), and the production team of a full album. *Record of the Year is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song. * Song of the Year is awarded to the songwriter(s) of a single song. * Best New Artist is awarded to an artist without reference to a song or album. Genre-specific fields As of the 2020 ceremony, there are 84 categories, including the General Field but not including special awards. No longer awardedChanges in the 2010s 2012 On April 6, 2011 the Recording Academy announced a major overhaul of many Grammy Award categories.Recording Academy Awards Category Restructuring In 2012, the number of categories fell from 109 to 78. Some categories were discontinued, others were merged or renamed. 2013 On June 8, 2012, the Academy announced a few changes , including the addition of three new categories: Best Classical Compendium, Best Latin Jazz Album and Best Urban Contemporary Album. This meant the number of categories in 2013 rose to 81. According to the Academy, the Best Classical Compendium is \\"for an album collection containing (...) newly recorded material of performances (vocal or instrumental) by various soloist(s) and/or ensemble(s) involving a mixture of classical subgenres.\\" Albums entered in this category cannot be entered in other classical album categories, but individual tracks can. The intent for the newly formed Best Latin Jazz Album is \\"to recognize recordings that represent the blending of jazz with Latin, Iberian-American, Brazilian, and Argentinean tango music.\\" The new Best Urban Contemporary Album category is for albums with contemporary songs derivative of R&B.; It is for artists who blend contemporary styles with R&B; music, such as urban (euro)pop, urban rock and/or urban alternative. Other changes for the 2013 Grammy Award season were: * Best Small Ensemble Performance category (in the classical field) has been renamed Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance. * Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album has been split into two categories: Best Latin Pop Album and Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album, thereby returning to the situation prior to 2012. * The Best Banda or Norte√±o Album and Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album categories have been merged into one category: Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano). * Mastering engineers will now be considered nominees and award winners in the Record of the Year category. 2014 Changes were made in 2014. One was the introduction of a new category, Best American Roots Song, which encompasses all subgenres in the American roots music field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk and regional roots music. The award will be presented to the songwriter(s). The Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category, introduced in 2012, was split and recognises metal performances only. It was renamed Best Metal Performance (returning to the situation prior to 2012). Hard rock performances are screened in the Best Rock Performance category, thus losing its own genre award. The two Music Video categories were renamed. The Best Short Form Music Video became the Best Music Video category, while Best Long Form Music Video is now Best Music Film. The rules and description of these two categories did not change. Also new for 2014 was the Music Educator Award. It recognizes \\"current educators (kindergarten through college, public and private schools) who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education and who demonstrate a commitment to the broader cause of maintaining music education in the schools.\\" 2015 The Recording Academy introduced further changes beginning on the 2015 ceremony: particularly allowing samples or interpolations of previously written songs in all songwriting categories, most notably the Song of the Year category. Additional changes include: * the introduction of Best American Roots Performance in the American Roots Music Field * Dance/Electronica Field to Dance/Electronic Music Field ** renaming Best Dance/Electronica Album to Best Dance/Electronic Album * introduction of Contemporary Instrumental Music Field ** renaming of Best Pop Instrumental Album to Best Contemporary Instrumental Album * restructuring the categories of the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Field ** creation of Best Gospel Performance/Song, with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s) ** creation of Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s) ** introduction of Best Roots Gospel Album * moving Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album to the Pop Field * changing Best Classical Vocal Solo (albums and tracks) to Best Classical Solo Vocal Album (limited to albums only) * renaming Best Instrumental Arrangement to Best Arrangement, Instruments And Vocals * renaming Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) to Best Arrangement, Instrumental Or A Cappella The introduction of the changed will push the total number of categories to 83. 2017 In June 2016, the Grammy organization announced changes to the voting and awarding process. Recordings released solely through streaming services became eligible to enter the award process. These recordings must be available through streaming platforms. Applicable streaming services are paid subscription, full catalog, on-demand streaming/limited download platforms that have existed as such within the United States for at least one full year as of the submission deadline. All recordings entered must have an assigned International Standard Recording Code (ISRC). Best New Artist rules were amended to remove the album barrier given trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted; many new artists first release singles, tracks, or EPs rather than full albums. To become eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group: * Must have released a minimum of five singles/tracks or one album, but no more than 30 singles/tracks or three albums. * May not have entered the category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group. * Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period. The Best Blues Album category was split back into two distinct categories, as they were prior to 2012: * Best Traditional Blues Album (Blues recordings with traditional blues song and harmonic structures, including various subgenres such as Delta blues, Piedmont blues, jump/swing blues, Chicago blues, and classic/Southern soul). * Best Contemporary Blues Album (Recordings which may employ non-traditional blues rhythms such as funk, hip-hop, reggae, and rock, or which feature contemporary techniques such as synthesizers or loops). The Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category (in the Rap field) was renamed as Best Rap/Sung Performance to allow solo performances, a result of \\"the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing.\\" Additional amendments were made to the number and type of music creators recognized in the categories of Best Choral Performance and Best Jazz Vocal Album.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The center of diversity is the province of KwaZulu-Natal in eastern South Africa. Dierama dracomontanum Description Plants of this genus are evergreen perennial herbs growing from large, fibrous-coated corms. The lowest two or three leaves are cataphylls that sheath the lower stem and become dry. The thin, wiry, branching stem may bend and droop when in flower. It is lined with leaves that have linear blades with thick longitudinal veins and often no midrib. The inflorescence is a panicle of several spikes of flowers. The spikes may hang like bells or grow erect. The bracts around the flowers are usually dry, thin, membranous, translucent, and streaked or veined with brown. The bell-shaped flowers of most wild species are pink; red, purple, yellow, and white taxa also exist. There are many cultivars in a range of colors, sometimes with spots of yellow or blue. The fruit is a spherical capsule. Dierama pendulum Dierama nixonianum Etymology The genus name is derived from the Greek word dierama, meaning \\"funnel,\\" and alludes to the flower shape.

The others erected were St Botolph's, Aldgate; St Botolph's, Aldersgate; and St Botolph's, Bishopsgate. By the end of the 11th century Botolph was regarded as the patron saint of boundaries, and by extension of trade and travel.Churches in the Landscape, p217-221, Richard Morris, This was apt as the church was close to the city wharves and also to London Bridge, which at the time of the church's construction lay slightly further east. During the 15th century the church was extended to the south over an undercroft. On the south side of this extension, at the south-east corner of the enlarged church, was a small stone-built vestry, which also had a cellar beneath. The parish rented out these cellars, usually to the same tenant. Archaeological excavations beneath part of the Billingsgate Lorry Park in 1982 uncovered the remains of the vault beneath the aisle of the church, and what may have been those of the one beneath the vestry. Angel corbel from St Botolph, accidentally cleared from the site by developers in 1984 and dumped on waste land in Thurrock from where it was recovered and saved. It had gone unnoticed during the archaeological excavation. Mid-1440s, possibly from the extension built by John Reynewell. A piece of land, formerly used as a passageway was given to the parish by the City corporation for use as an additional churchyard. Having been enclosed within a brick wall, it was consecrated in 1617.Newcourt 1708, p.311 In 1620 the church was \\"repaired and beautified\\" at a cost of more than ¬£600. The composer Thomas Morley was buried in the churchyard. Destruction St Botolph's, Billingsgate was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt. Instead, the parish was united to that of St George Botolph Lane. The site of the church and its adjoining churchyard continued to be used for burials, although a house was built on part of the site of the nave and rented out by the parish. In around 1677 a shop was built above a newly constructed burial vault in the churchyard and leased out for the benefit of the poor at a rent of ¬£4 a year; a second vault was built, and a shop constructed over it in 1693. In the same year the site of the chancel was sold and the land used to widen the lane between Thames Street and Botolph Wharf. The upper churchyard was also retained as a burial ground for the united parishes. It survives as a privately owned garden at the corner of Monument Street and Botolph Lane, under the name of \\"One Tree Park\\".

It grew from efforts in the 1940s to coordinate improvements to regional transportation and the local environment. During World War II, the Pittsburgh Regional Planning Association President Richard King Mellon, Carnegie Institute of Technology President Robert Doherty, and others organized local leaders to create a postwar planning committee. Pittsburgh Mayor David L. Lawrence and Allegheny County Commissioner John Kane were early recruits. The Allegheny Conference was officially established in 1944. The city's most visible problem in the first half of the 20th century was air pollution. The Conference brokered an agreement for phased-in implementation of smoke control that became city policy. After the Conference voiced its concern for legal loopholes to the state legislature in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a comprehensive anti-pollution law was passed in 1949 for Allegheny County. The clearer skies over the city both attracted new business and encouraged local corporations to retain and expand their Pittsburgh headquarters. The pollution-control program explicitly influenced the decision of the Equitable Life Assurance Society to invest in planning the Gateway Center project, a keystone of economic revitalization in Downtown Pittsburgh during Renaissance I. This also led to the development of Point State Park. The Conference also played a role in the appropriation of funds for the construction of flood control dams on the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. In the 1940s and 1950s, mass transit in Allegheny County was in jeopardy because of 40 private transit companies and increased competition from cars. The Conference released a report in 1951 calling for all local transit lines to be under one authority. Public suspicions and private interests delayed the measure until service cutbacks and strikes rekindled the idea in 1957. The Conference was instrumental in building public and private support. In 1959, legislation was passed to create the Port Authority of Allegheny County, and the first buses were rolling in 1964. Allegheny Conference is a longtime partner with the RIDC. In 1981 it formed the Regional Economic Development Committee with the RIDC that included \\"18 of the region's top corporate executives\\". The Conference also led the transformation of the 14-block Penn- Liberty Corridor into the Pittsburgh Cultural District. A related effort was Strategy 21 that enabled public and private agencies in Allegheny County to speak with one voice when requesting state funds. Strategy 21 not only resulted in projects that ranged from the new Pittsburgh International Airport to The Andy Warhol Museum. In 2001, the Conference entered into a strategic affiliation with the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, the Pennsylvania Economy League of Southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance (PRA), with the four organizations merging many staff positions in 2003.

Based on a story by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, the film is about a vaudeville performer who gets mixed up with British and German secret agents in the days just before the United State's entry into World War II. The film features an uncredited cameo appearance by Bing Crosby. Plot When a British secret agent is murdered in the line of duty, agent Karen Bentley inherits the mission from her partner. The mission is to deliver a flight plan for a hundred American bomber planes to a British agent in Chicago. The plans are hidden in a small medallion of a scorpion that Karen wears. Karen arrives to New York City from Europe by ship and escapes the clutches of enemy agents by hiding in a variety theatre. To improve her chances of getting away and get a good cover, she charms an actor named Larry Haines, who performs a small act called \\"Percy\\" involving his penguin. Larry tells her that he and his penguin are heading west to Hollywood to appear in a film. They have a contract paying $500 a week for Percy and $30 for him as his trainer. Karen accompanies Larry to the train and plants the medallion on him before he boards the train. Unaware of what he is now carrying, Larry leaves New York, and the German agents, Mme. Stephanie Runick and Dr. Hugo Streger, are also on board the same train, keeping a close eye on Larry. The agents manage to scare up Larry with their odd behavior, and in Albany, Karen boards the train. Larry meets Karen and finds her a little too odd, since she didn't board the train back in New York with him. When the train stops for three hours in Chicago, Karen manages to steal Larry's suitcase, which now contains the jacket where the medallion is hidden. Larry follows Karen and the suitcase to an address where she is supposed to meet an agent, but Karen finds the agent murdered and has to change her plans. She is instructed to continue to Los Angeles instead. Since Larry has already seen her and the dead body, Karen reveals her true identity to him and asks his help. When the German agents are watching, they fake a domestic argument between the two of them, where Larry is violent against Karen. The police arrive to the scene and they are both arrested for disturbing the peace. While under arrest, the two of them are transported safely out of the building and past the German agents. Karen and Larry are released after they make up in the police patrol car. They don't get very far until the police chase them again, because the German agents anonymously tell the police they are responsible for murdering the British agent. The murder is on the news and Larry is named the \\"love slayer\\". During their frantic escape from the police, Karen and Larry fall in love. They find a place to hide at the top of Union Hall for the night, but the morning after they get on a bus headed out of the city on a sightseeing tour. They hijack the bus and then steal a plane to fly to Los Angeles. When the plane is out of fuel they land in the middle of nowhere and are arrested again, this time for stealing food on a farm. In jail they are recognized as the couple killing the British operative, but they escape and are chased again. They manage to jump a freight train to Los Angeles. The address Karen was supposed to visit turns out to be a funeral parlor, but the Germans have beaten them to it and taken the British agent hostage. Karen and Larry manage not to get caught though and flee the scene to a U.S. Air base nearby, where they take refuge and deliver the secret bomber plans.

Playing career Croft joined Chester as a schoolboy, with his debut coming as a 17-year-old substitute away at Peterborough United on 24 August 1985. Although that was to be his only league appearance during Chester's promotion season from Division Four, he started two matches in the Associate Members' Cup. Croft became much more involved in first team duty in 1986‚Äì87 when he featured in 21 league games, scoring his first league goal in a 3‚Äì1 win over Bristol Rovers in November 1986. This same period saw several other youngsters such as Chris Lightfoot and Colin Woodthorpe break through the Chester youth ranks and go on to enjoy long professional careers. Croft opted to drop into Division Four with Cambridge United in October 1988, but after less than a year away he rejoined Chester. During his spell at Cambridge, Croft was loaned out to Grantham Town. Back at Chester, Croft was to be a regular in the left wing berth over the next three years. In the summer of 1992 he made a surprise ¬£60,000 move to Premier League side Queens Park Rangers, but he was unable to make the first-team over the next three years. His only league action during this period came during a loan spell with Shrewsbury Town, playing four times midway through their 1993‚Äì94 Division Three title success.

History After the invasion of Italy by the Lombards, Teramo became the residence of a gastald, depending on the Duke of Spoleto; under the Franks it was annexed by the Normans. In 1155 Count Robert II of Loritello rebelled against King Roger II of Sicily and destroyed the city, soon rebuilt through the efforts of Bishop Guido (1122), for which he and his successors were granted the investiture of the principality.Palma, Storia ecclesiastica I, pp. 173-181. In 1215 the privilege was granted to the bishops of Teramo by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor of celebrating their first solemn Mass armed and having arms also on the altar. Pope Clement VII dispensed Bishop Francesco Cherigatto from observing the custom in a brief of 15 January 1524; the practice was finally abolished in 1554.Palma II, p. 229. Eubel, III, p. 112, note 12: 1554 Maii 16 Jacobum ep., qui ex regio privilegio armatus armis albis fatione principatus civitatis Terami primam missam celebrare consuevit, liberat S. S. ab huiusmodi solemni celebratione ad minuendas expensas. Hardly had the town risen again when it began a series of quarrels with Ascoli, which more than once threatened to become sanguinary. Teramo resisted till the end of 1270 during the Angevin invasion.Palma, II, pp. 24-26. A little later the bishops abandoned their temporal sovereignty and a royal captain was installed. In the beginning of the 15th century the Melatino, di Janni, and Acquaviva began to struggle for possession of the town. In 1416 it was sacked by Lordino de Saligny, a Frenchman, exasperated at being deprived of the title of High Constable of the kingdom of Naples. During the pillage the treasures of the cathedral disappeared.Palma, II, pp. 95-105. A census book of the bishops of Teramo, which was revised under Bishop Francesco Cherigatto (1522‚Äì1539), provides extensive information on the organization of the diocese, and on its churches, chapels, and property.Palma, II, pp. 240-267, giving summaries. In 1818 the diocese of Campli was incorporated into the See of Teramo.The diocese of Campli was established by Pope Pius V in 1570. It was abolished by Pius VII, in the Bull De utiliori, in: , no. DCCXCVII, ¬ß 29: praeterea episcopalem ecclesiam Camplensem perpetuo supprimentes, illius civitatem et dioecesim alteri episcopali ecclesiae Aprutinae adjungimus et incorporamus. This was a consequence of the Concordat of 7 March 1818, between Pope Pius VII and King Ferdinand I of Naples. Ugo Benigni, \\"Teramo\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia, errs in stating: \\"In 1818 the Diocese of Ortona, which is now only an archipresbyteral church, was incorporated with the See of Teramo.\\" Ortona was incorporated with the diocese of Lanciano. De utiliori ¬ß 20. Cappelletti, XXI, p. 443. In 1949 the diocese of Teramo was affected by changes brought about by movements of population as well as the new political structure of the Abruzzi brought about by the Fascists, the end of the Kingdom of Italy, and the creation of the Italian Republic. As the capital of a province, Pescara deserved to become the seat of a bishop; but the city extended over two different dioceses, Chieti and Penne.\\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\\": Hisce namque novissimis temporibus Piscar√≠a urbs dioecesis Pinnensis, quae ad maris Adriatici oras iacet, tale incrementum sumpsit, ut, magni facta nominis civitas, merito eiusdem nominis Provinciae caput evaserit. Haec Piscar√≠a urbs nunc ex unione efformata est duorum iam prius exsistentium oppidorum : quorum alterum, Piscar√≠a nuncupatum, ad Theatinam archidioecesim pertinet; alterum vero, cui nomen Castrum Maris Adriatici, intra fines exstat dioecesis Pinnensis; ita ut nova Piscar√≠a urbs partim Archiepiscopi Theatini, partim Episcopi Pinnensis iurisdictioni subiecta est. Pope Pius XII therefore decided on the rearrangement of the diocesan system, which he effected in the Bull Dioecesium subscriptiones of 1 July 1949.\\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\\", Acta Apostolicae Sedis 42 (1950), pp. 135‚Äì137. The seat of the diocese of Penne e Atri was transferred from Penne to the city of Pescara, and its name changed to Pinnensis-Piscarensis. The cathedral in Penne was named a co-cathedral. The diocesan seminary was transferred to Pescara. These decisions left status of the diocese of Atri in question. Since the diocese of Atri was entirely in the civil province of Teramo, Atri was united aequaliter principaliter with the diocese of Teramo, forming the diocese of Teramo e Atri.\\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\\", p. 136, nos. 2-10. In 1986, the name of the diocese of Teramo e Atri (Aprutina et Hatriensis) was changed to Teramo-Atri. This meant a major change in the organization of the dioceses. A decree approved by Pope John Paul II in an audience of 27 September 1986, and published by the Congregation of Bishops on 30 September, cancelled the union of the two dioceses under one bishop aequaliter principaliter. Atri was subsumed into the diocese of Teramo. The former cathedral of Atri was allowed to call itself a co-cathedral, and its Chapter was named the Chapter of the Co-cathedral; but there was only one diocesan cathedral at Teramo, and its Chapter was the one diocesan Chapter. There was to be one episcopal curia, one ecclesiastical tribunal, one college of Consultors, one Council of Priests, and one seminary, all of which were at Teramo or a place designated by the bishop. Priests and deacons were to be incardinated in the new Diocese of Teramo-Atri.Acta Apostolicae Sedis Volume LXXIX (Citta del Vaticano 1987), pp. 645-647.

The date of Bishop Marino's alleged deposition as a follower of Pope Gregory XII (Roman Obedience) was not in 1412, as Ughelli surmised. Marinus attended the Council of Constance as an Auditor. He was transferred to the diocese of Recanati e Macerata by Pope Martin V on 6 July 1418 (Eubel, II, p. 411). Cf.

He was appointed Bishop of Teramo on 4 May 1517 by Pope Leo X. He died in 1522, his successor being appointed on 7 September. Palma believes that Camillo never visited his diocese, being confined in Rome by a serious and ultimately fatal disease. The catalogue of the Bishops of Teramo describes his condition: Is tamen, simul ac a Leone X. Pontifice Maximo Aprutina est Ecclesiae praefectus, acerbissima cujusdam diuturni morbi, nulli Medicorum cogniti, correptus inclementia; postguam miserabili cruciatu menses plurimos decubuit afflictatus, morbidemum truculentia, et totius corporis doloribus oppressus, virenti adhuc aetate, animam degit: incredibili apud omnes suo relicto desiderio.

His appointment as Bishop of Teramo had to wait for the arrival of Pope Adrian VI from Spain and his coronation in August 1522 for the bulls to be signed, on 7 September 1522. Even so, Cherigatto had not yet been to Teramo in January of 1524. He continued in service to the popes. In November 1528 he was in Rome, and therefore appointed his brother Lodovico as his locumtenens. In 1529 he was governor of Viterbo. He was in Rome in 1530, where he named his brother Gregorio as Vicar General of his brother Lodovico. He also travelled to Venice in that year. He died in November 1539, the last entry in his bullarium having the date of 8 November. The legal notice of his death arrived from Rome in Teramo on 27 November.

On 22 November 1539 he had been appointed Papal Vicar for the city of Rome, a clear indication that Teramo was a benefice, and that Guidiccioni would not be a resident bishop. A week later, on 19 December, he was named a Cardinal. Because of the press of his duties in the Roman Curia, he resigned the diocese of Teramo on 22 March 1542. He was not consecrated a bishop, however, until 1546. Palma, III, p. 15.

Family  A small family of proteins named Gene for Apoptosis and Differentiation (JADE) includes three members encoded by individual genes: Plant Homeo-domain-17 (PHF17, JADE1), PHF16 (JADE3), and PHF15 (JADE2). All JADE family proteins bear two notable mid molecule domains: the canonical Plant Homeo-domain (PHD) zinc finger and extended PHD-like zinc finger. JADE1 therefore is classified as a member of the PHD protein family. There are two known protein products of the PHF17 gene, the full length JADE1 (JADE1L) and its splice variant missing the C-terminal fragment also called short isoform (JADE1S).  Discovery  Nagase et al. cloned and sequenced 100 individual cDNAs from fetal brain cDNA library, including clone KIAA1807 which was designated PHF17. The predicted 702-amino acid protein product of that clone was similar to the human zinc finger protein BR140 (BRPF1). Based on sequence database analysis the study suggested that PHF17 may function in nucleic acid managing pathway. Using yeast two hybrid pull down approach to search for new partners of protein product of the Von Hippel Lindau gene (pVHL) another study identified cDNA which matched to KIAA1807 clone. The protein product of that cDNA was given name JADE1 (Jade-1, PHF17). The deduced 509 amino acid long protein product of JADE1 cDNA was further confirmed as physical partner of pVHL. In a genetic screen study searching for genes involved in embryogenesis, the mouse orthologue of JADE1 was identified. That study, provided first characterization of the JADE1 gene and defined novel JADE family. The study yielded mice with knock out of JADE1 gene. Jade1 transcripts in both humans and mice undergo alternative splicing and polyadenylation producing two major transcripts, the full length 6 kb mRNA and 3.6 kb mRNA. Two resultant protein products of the JADE1 gene were designated JADE1S for the short (which is same as(3)) and JADE1L for the long isoform. Several minor transcripts are also detected. The database analysis revealed two additional JADE1 paralogues and members of JADE family, JADE2, and JADE3. JADE3 is identical to E9 protein identified in an earlier independent study which suggested role in apoptosis for PHF16/JADE3/E9 in breast cancer cells. JADE1 has been mapped to chromosome 4 (4q26-q27). JADE1 is conserved and its orthologues have been found or predicted in most every metazoan. Gene structure and sequences, variants, conservation, orthologues and paralogs, JADE1 phylogenetic tree and large scale screening of JADE1 tissue expression can be found in several extensive databases (https://www.genecards.org; http://useast.ensembl.org).  Structure  The full length JADE1 polypeptide bears one canonical and one extended PHD zinc finger domains. Other domains include the N-terminal candidate PEST domain, Enhancer of polycomb-like domain and the C-terminal nuclear localization (NLS) signal (prosite.expasy.org). JADE1 protein is a target for post translational modifications, including phosphorylation (Fig 1Figure 1. Mass Spec (red and green) and in silico (black) analysis of JADE1 phosphorylation sites (https://web.archive.org/web/20190403134107/https://www.phosphosite.org/); sites identified through MS analysis are in: ). Six amino acid residues were identified to be phosphorylated in cell cycle-dependent manner via Aurora A kinase pathway. JADE1 is a target of phosphorylation by Casein kinase 2 (CK2). In addition, multiple phosphorylation sites are found by high throughput screening approaches and in silico analysis. Summary schematic for JADE1L and JADE1S proteins phosphorylation sites with references are found in. Proteins bearing in tandem canonical and extended PHD fingers form a small subfamily within the large PHD protein family (www.genenames.org). Other proteins bearing tandem of PHD fingers and related to JADE1 include proteins that are components of chromatin binding and modifying complexes BRPF1, BRPF3, BRD1. The crystal structure of JADE1 PHD domains has not been solved. Canonical PHD finger motif has signature C4HC3, represents relatively small, stable structure, and is distinct from the C3HC4 type RING finger. PHD domains are able to recognize and bind specific methylated lysine of histone H3, which defined these domains as epigenetic histone code readers. Reviews describing structure and properties of PHD fingers in depth are available.  Cellular function  JADE1 proteins are multifunctional and interact with several protein partners. = Histone acetylation = Function of JADE1 in histone acetylation and transcription activation which required the second extended PHD zinc finger was reported in 2004(16). JADE1 dramatically increases levels of acetylated histone H4 within chromatin, but not histone H3, a specificity characteristic to the MYST family HAT TIP60 and HBO1. TIP60 physically associates with JADE1 and augments JADE1 HAT function in live cells. TIP60 and JADE1 mutually stabilized each other. Transcriptional and HAT activities of JADE1 require PHD2. Results suggest the chromatin targeting role for JADE1 PHD2. In addition, PHD2 of JADE1 binds the N-terminal tail of histone H3 within chromatin context irrespective of methylation status. Studies analyzing native complexes of INhibitor of Growth (ING) PHD finger family of proteins revealed that ING4 and ING5 proteins are associated with JADE1S and HAT HBO1, while ING3 is associated with EPC1 (JADE1 homolog), TIP60 (HBO1 homolog) and several other partners. Both complexes also included a small Eaf6 protein. The biochemical and in silico analysis of complexes formed by HBO1 and TIP60 suggested common architecture and supported the role for JADE1 in bulk histone H4 acetylation. Characterization of JADE1 and HBO1 functional interactions show structural and functional similarities between the complexes(16, 19). Similarly to TIP60, JADE1 and HBO1 mutually stabilize each other. JADE1 binds to and enables HBO1 to enhance global histone H4 acetylation, which requires intact PHD2 finger. Similarly to HBO1, JADE1 is responsible for bulk histone H4 acetylation in cultured cells. H4K5, H4K12, and most likely H4K8 are targets of JADE1-dependent acetylation in cultured cells and in vivo. Several potential transcription targets of JADE1 have been suggested from experiments using screening approaches. According to screening genomic analysis done by ChIP-chip assay JADE1L complex is found mainly along the coding regions of many genes and JADE1L abundance correlates mostly with H3K36me3 histone mark. JADE1L over expression correlates with increased quantities of H4acK8 in the coding region of many genes. The two PHD zinc fingers of JADE1 appear to bind preferentially non-methylated N-terminal peptide of histone. JADE1 isoforms assemble at least two different complexes, JADE1L-HBO1-ING4/5 and JADE1S-HBO1 complex. Due to the lack of the C-terminal fragment, JADE1S is incapable of binding ING4/5 partners. A small less characterized protein Eaf6 is also another component of JADE1 complexes. = Cell cycle = Acetylation of N-terminal fragments of bulk histone H4 has been known to correlate with DNA synthesis and cell division. Several studies support cell cycle role for JADE1 linked to HBO1 pathway. Both, JADE1 and HBO1 are independently required for the acetylation of bulk histone H4 in cultured cells. The depletion of JADE1 proteins by siRNA results in 1) decreased levels of histone H4 bulk acetylation; 2) slower rates of DNA synthesis in cultured cells; 3) decreased levels of the total and chromatin-bound HBO1; 4) abrogation of chromatin recruitment of MCM7. Agreeing with these results, JADE1L over-expression increases chromatin-bound MCM3 protein. The effects of JADE1 depletion on DNA replication events are similar to those described originally for HBO1 and suggests adaptor role for JADE1 in HBO1-mediated cell cycle regulation. JADE1 role in DNA damage has been suggested. A recently discovered non-coding RNA lncRNA-JADE regulates JADE1 expression and provides a functional link between the DNA damage response (DDR) and bulk histone H4 acetylation. Results support role in DNA synthesis linked to histone H4 acetylation. In cultured cells knock down of lncRNA-JADE increased cells sensitivity to DNA damaging drugs. In mice tumor xenograft model, the knock down of lncRNA-JADE inhibited xenograft mammary tumor growth. In a pilot human study, higher levels of lncRNA-JADE as well as JADE1 protein were detected in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Lastly, the higher levels of JADE1 protein inversely correlated with survival rates of patients with breast cancer. The study suggests that lncRNA-JADE might contribute to breast tumorigenesis, and that JADE1 protein mediates at least part of this effect. JADE1 and cytokinesis. JADE1S negatively regulates cytokinesis of the epithelial cell cycle, a function specific to the small isoform. First report that suggested JADE1 function in G2/M/G1 transition showed that during the late G2 phase, JADE1S undergoes phosphorylation linked to its dissociation from chromatin into the cytoplasm. Mass Spectral analysis identified that total of six individual amino acid residues are phosphorylated by a mitotic kinase. Based on pharmacological analysis, JADE1 phosphorylation and compartmentalization is regulated by Aurora A and Aurora B pathways. Other kinases have been reported and may play a role. Upon completion of mitosis around telophase, the main pool of the JADE1S protein undergoes de-phosphorylation and re-associates with apparently condensing chromatin inside the reformed nuclei. A discrete pool of JADE1S associates with the cleavage furrow and subsequently appears in the midbody of the cytokinetic bridge. Only JADE1S, but not JADE1L or HBO1 was found in the midbody of the cells undergoing cytokinesis. The spatial regulation of JADE1S during the cell division suggested role in G2/M to G1 transition, which includes cytokinesis and final abscission. Cytokinesis is the final step of cell cycle which controls fidelity of division of cellular content, including cytoplasm, membrane, and chromatin. Cytokinetic bridge is severed during the final abscission which occurs near the midbody and may take up to 2 hours. Cytokinesis and final abscission are tightly controlled by regulatory protein complexes and checkpoint proteins. The number of reports concerning cytokinesis control has been growing over the past decade. JADE1 role in cytokinesis was demonstrated by use of several functional assays and cell culture models. DNA profiling by FACS showed that JADE1S depletion facilitated rates of G1-cells accumulation in synchronously dividing HeLa cells. The depletion of JADE1S protein in asynchronously dividing cells decreased the proportion of cytokinetic cells, and increased the proportion of multi-nuclear cells. The data demonstrated that JADE1 negatively controls cytokinesis, presumably by contributing to cytokinesis delay. JADE1 down- regulation increased number of multi-nuclear cells indicative of failed cytokinesis, while JADE1S moderate overexpression augmented the number of cytokinetic cells indicative of cytokinetic delay. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase by specific small molecule drugs resulted in the release of JADE1S-mediated cytokinetic delay and allowed progression of abscission. Since Aurora B is a key regulator of the NoCut, JADE1S is likely to regulate cytokinesis at the abscission checkpoint control. JADE1S but not JADE1L or HBO1 was found in centrosomes of dividing cells throughout the cell cycle, and neither of these proteins was found in cilia. In contrast, another study reported JADE1 localization to the cilia and centrosome. The study did not communicate on JADE1 isoform specificity. Centrosomes are the cytoskeleton nucleation centers. Centrosome signaling contributes to the definition of cell shape, motility, orientation, polarity, division plane and to the fidelity of sister chromosome separation during mitosis and cytokinesis. = pVHL = The first protein partner of JADE1S has been identified in 2002 in a study searching for new partners of the pVHL, which is a tumor suppressor. A few follow up studies characterized binding and provided some insights on functional interactions of JADE1-pVHL. The human pVHL is mutated in von Hippel‚ÄìLindau hereditary disease, and in majority of sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas. Properties and function of pVHL have been investigated for many decades and extensive literature is available. One of the better known functions of pVHL is to mediate protein ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. As a component of ubiquitin ligase E3 complex pVHL binds and targets several known factors, including HIF1a and HIF2a for ubiquitination. Mechanism of HIF1a activation by hypoxia and role of pVHL in this pathway has been reported over a decade ago. The VHL protein has been intensely studied and the link of naturally occurring mutations to cancers established. Other causative HIF-1a-independent pVHL pathways have been considered. The pVHL- JADE1S physical interaction was identified by yeast-two hybrid screening analysis and was further confirmed biochemically. Co-transfection of pVHL increased JADE1S protein half-life and abundance, suggesting potential positive relationship. Certain pVHL cancer-derived truncations but not point mutations diminished pVHL-JADE1 stabilization function, suggesting link to pVHL-associated cancers. Molecular pathways and cellular significance of JADE1-pVHL interactions are not well understood. Single study describing JADE1S intrinsic ubiquitin-ligase activity and ubiquitination of beta-catenin has been reported in year 2008. Based on that study a model has been proposed that pVHL regulates beta-catenin through JADE1, and PHD zinc fingers are required for this activity. = Apoptosis = JADE1S function in apoptosis has been proposed but the mechanisms remain elusive and results are hard to reconcile. According to studies, JADE1 overexpression slows rates of cellular growth and induces cell cycle arrest protein p21. Several attempts to establish dependable cell lines stably expressing JADE1S protein have not been successful, presumably due to the negative cells self-selection. Contrary to that, another study shows that JADE1 downregulation decreased rates of DNA synthesis in synchronously dividing cells. According to indirect immunofluorescence and microscopy analysis of cultured cells, cultured cells overload with JADE1 protein causes cell toxicity and side effects. Cells undergo morphological changes that do not resemble apoptosis but suggest severely impaired cell cycle including dyeing cells with abnormal shapes and large, multi-lobular nuclei. Based on JADE1S-mediated regulation of cell cycle other interpretations are considered: JADE1 overload might cause prolonged NoCut and stalled cytokinesis or severe cell cycle misbalance rather than direct transcription activation of apoptosis.  Biological role  The biological role of JADE1 has not been elucidated. Limited number of publications addresses this question using mice models. The most comprehensive study which was published in 2003, identified mice orthologue of human JADE1, Jade1, and investigated Jade1 expression during mice embryogenesis. Searching for developmentally regulated genes the authors used gene trap screen analysis and identified mouse Jade1 as gene strongly regulated during embryogenesis. Insertion of the vector into the third intron of the Jade1 gene lead to the production of a 47-amino-acid truncated protein. The gene trap insertional mutation resulted in Jade1-beta-galactosidase reporter fusion product and Jade1 null allele. While the homozygotes for the gene trap integration did not produce strong developmental phenotype, the fusion product revealed Jade1 gene spatial-temporal expression in mouse embryonic cells and tissues of developing embryo up to 15.5-d.p.c. In addition the study reports experimental and in silico comparative analysis of Jade1 mRNA transcripts, Jade1 gene structure and analysis of Jade1 protein orthologues from mouse human and zebra fish. Jade1 expression was detected in extraembryonic ectoderm and trophoblast, which are placental components important for vasculogenesis, as well as in sites enriched with multipotent or tissue-specific progenitors, including neural progenitors(2). The dynamics of Jade1 reporter expression in these areas indicates the involvement in the determination and elongation of anterior posterior axis, an important point of the study). The potential role for human JADE1 in the renewal of embryonic stem cell and embryonal carcinoma cell cultures was suggested in another screening study which showed that, in cultured stem cells activation of stem cell transcription factor OCT4 pathway upregulated JADE1 gene expression along with stem cell factors NANOG, PHC1, USP44 and SOX2. Role of JADE1 in epithelial cell proliferation was addressed in a murine model of acute kidney injury and regeneration. Expression patterns and dynamics of HBO1-JADE1S/L were examined in regenerating tubular epithelial cells. Ischemia and reperfusion injury resulted in an initial decrease in JADE1S, JADE1L, and HBO1 protein levels, which returned to the baseline during renal recovery. Expression levels of HBO1 and JADE1S recovered as cell proliferation rate reached maximum, whereas JADE1L recovered after bulk proliferation had diminished. The temporal expression of JADE1 correlated with the acetylation of histone H4 (H4K5 and H4K12) but not that of histone H3 (H4K14), suggesting that the JADE1-HBO1 complex specifically marks H4 during epithelial cell proliferation. The results of the study implicate JADE1-HBO1 complex in acute kidney injury and suggest distinct roles for JADE1 isoforms during epithelial cell recovery.  Disease associations  Role of JADE1 in human disease has not been elucidated. A recent study searched for novel submicroscopic genetic changes in myelofibrosis, which is a bone marrow cancer. The study identified seven novel deletions and translocations in small cohort of patients with primary myelofibrosis. JADE1 and the adjacent gene called Sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) were significantly modified. As a result of mutation, JADE1 gene has deletions of intron 5-6 and exons 6-11, which would produce JADE1 missing a large chunk of protein starting from the PHD zinc finger. The relevance to pathogenesis is under investigation. In a handful of pilot studies JADE1 expression was examined in colon cancers and renal carcinomas. The results in these studies do not always reconcile. The results of some studies are generated mostly from the histochemical analysis of tumor specimens using JADE1 antibody with uncharacterized specificities towards JADE1 in general, and JADE1S or JADE1L in particular. Results of study using in silico microarray algorithm analysis shows, that PHF17 mRNA may play a role in the development of pancreatic cancer. These promising lines of investigations require further controls and additional assessments.  Interactions  Several proteins interact with JADE1, including: pVHL, TIP60, HBO1, ING4, ING5, √ü-catenin, NPHP4.

He was reported to be a cousin of actress Rita Moreno. He attended the University of California before leaving to join the orchestra of Anson Weeks. His career began in 1929 when he sang in a vocal group. His big breakthrough came in 1933 when he joined Griff Williams's band in San Francisco as a singer and guitar player. Later he became a part of popular bandleader Dick Jurgens' orchestra. Moreno and Jurgens recorded many songs through the label Okeh Records, charting the number one hit \\"One Dozen Roses\\" in 1942. Moreno changed band once more, in 1943, when he joined Harry James' band. Moreno appeared in the films Two Girls and a Sailor (1944) and Bathing Beauty (1944) along with the rest of the band. He formed his own band in 1947 with his wife, singer Perri Mitchell and others. Beginning June 30, 1958, Moreno had a local television program, The Buddy Moreno Show, on KMOX-TV in St. Louis, Missouri. He relocated to St. Louis in the 1950s, when his band was selected to be the house band in The Chase Park Plaza Hotel's Chase Club, which led to a national radio program, Saturdays at the Chase.

Biography Born in Beirut of a French engineer father, Edouard Coze, and a mother, Sonia/Sofia Dabija, a Russian princess with lineage from old Serbian royalty, Coze grew acquainted with riding and roping as a young man. On his return to France, as a teenager he became co- founder of Scouts de France, the first French Scout program. Coze was the first French Wood Badger and a Chevalier de France, and served as editor of the Scout magazine. During years of art training, an increasing fascination with cowboys and Native Americans led to four museum-sponsored anthropological expeditions to western Canada (1928-1932) and a book, M≈ìurs et histoire des Peaux-Rouges (1928, with Rene Th√©venin), still in print as a standard work. Many of Coze's hundreds of collected artifacts now reside at the Royal Alberta Museum. Coze moved to the United States circa 1938, in Pasadena, California since 1942, spending two years producing major educational murals at Mesa Verde National Park. He acted as a technical adviser on the Hollywood films Uncertain Glory (1944) and Rogues' Regiment where he also had a small role.

Structure  CapZ-alpha2 is a 33.0 kDa protein composed of 286 amino acids. CAPZA2 is located on human chromosome 7, position q31.2-q31.3. The primary sequence of CapZ-alpha2 contains three C-terminal, regularly spaced leucines at positions 258, 262 and 266 found in consensus sequence of KxxxLxxE/DLxxALxxK/R that are critical for actin binding; these residues are conserved within the CapZ-beta isoform. CapZ-alpha2 is 85% identical to CapZ-alpha1, and differ by a small number of key amino acids; 21 amino acid differences perpetrate isoform specificity. CapZ-alpha2 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle, where it caps sarcomeric actin at Z-discs; the ratio of CapZ- alpha2 to CapZ-alpha1 varies significantly among different tissues.  Function  CapZ binds the barbed end of actin filaments and prevents addition or loss of actin monomers to filaments. It has also been observed that CapZ functions to organize myofilaments during myofibrillogenesis and is present at Z-discs in muscle prior to the striation of actin filaments, suggesting that CapZ may function to direct the polarity and organization of sarcomeric actin during I-band formation. The function of CapZ-alpha2 may be modulated by the calcium-binding protein S100A in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues, as crosslinking studies have shown S100A to directly interact with the C-terminal region of CapZ-alpha in the presence of calcium. CapZ appears to regulate intracellular signaling of contractile proteins in cardiac muscle. It has been demonstrated that the presence of CapZ at Z-discs modulates the ability of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dephosphorylate cardiac myofilament proteins, including myosin binding protein C, troponin T and myosin regulatory light chain; likely because extraction of CapZ decreased the amount of myofilament- associated PP1.  Clinical Significance  In humans undergoing exercise- induced muscle damage via 300 maximal eccentric contractions, skeletal muscle biopsies subjected to DNA microarrays showed that CapZ-alpha expression was upregulated, suggesting that CapZ-alpha may be involved in skeletal muscle growth and remodeling, and/or stress management.

It is part of a family of six Set1-like H3K4 methyltransferases that also contains KMT2A (or MLL1), KMT2B (or MLL2), KMT2C (or MLL3), KMT2F (or SET1A), and KMT2G (or SET1B). KMT2D is a large protein over 5,500 amino acids in size and is widely expressed in adult tissues. The protein co-localizes with lineage determining transcription factors on transcriptional enhancers and is essential for cell differentiation and embryonic development. It also plays critical roles in regulating cell fate transition, metabolism, and tumor suppression. Mutations in KMT2D have been associated with Kabuki syndrome, congenital heart disease, and various forms of cancer.  Structure = Gene = In mice, KMT2D is coded by the Kmt2d gene located on chromosome 15F1. Its transcript is 19,823 base pairs long and contains 55 exons and 54 introns. In humans, KMT2D is coded by the KMT2D gene located on chromosome 12q13.12. Its transcript is 19,419 base pairs long and contains 54 exons and 53 introns. = Protein = KMT2D is homologous to Trithorax-related (Trr), which is a Trithorax-group protein. The mouse and human KMT2D proteins are 5,588 and 5,537 amino acids in length, respectively. Both species of the protein weigh about 600 kDa. KMT2D contains an enzymatically active C-terminal SET domain that is responsible for its methyltransferase activity and maintaining protein stability in cells. Near the SET domain are a plant homeotic domain (PHD) and FY-rich N/C-terminal (FYRN and FYRC) domains. The protein also contains six N-terminal PHDs, a high mobility group (HMG-I), and nine nuclear receptor interacting motifs (LXXLLs). It was shown that amino acids Y5426 and Y5512 are critical for the enzymatic activity of human KMT2D in vitro. In addition, mutation of Y5477 in mouse KMT2D, which corresponds to Y5426 in human KMT2D, resulted in the inactivation of KMT2D's enzymatic activity in embryonic stem cells. Depletion of cellular H3K4 methylation reduces KMT2D levels, indicating that the protein's stability could be regulated by cellular H3K4 methylation. = Protein complex = Several components of the KMT2D complex were first purified in 2003, and then the entire complex was identified in 2007. Along with KMT2D, the complex also contains ASH2L, RbBP5, WDR5, DPY30, NCOA6, UTX (also known as KDM6A), PA1, and PTIP. WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30 form the four-subunit sub-complex WRAD, which is critical for H3K4 methyltransferase activity in all mammalian Set1-like histone methyltransferase complexes. WDR5 binds directly with FYRN/FYRC domains of C-terminal SET domain-containing fragments of human KMT2C and KMT2D. UTX, the complex‚Äôs H3K27 demethylase, PTIP, and PA1 are subunits that are unique to KMT2C and KMT2D. KMT2D acts as a scaffold protein within the complex; absence of KMT2D results in destabilization of UTX and collapse of the complex in cells.  Enhancer regulation  KMT2D is a major enhancer mono-methyltransferase and has partial functional redundancy with KMT2C. The protein selectively binds enhancer regions based on type of cell and stage of differentiation. During differentiation, lineage determining transcription factors recruit KMT2D to establish cell-type specific enhancers. For example, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Œ≤ (C/EBPŒ≤), an early adipogenic transcription factor, recruits and requires KMT2D to establish a subset of adipogenic enhancers during adipogenesis. Depletion of KMT2D prior to differentiation prevents the accumulation of H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1), H3K27 acetylation, the transcriptional coactivator Mediator, and RNA polymerase II on enhancers, resulting in severe defects in gene expression and cell differentiation. KMT2C and KMT2D also identify super-enhancers and are required for formation of super-enhancers during cell differentiation. Mechanistically, KMT2C and KMT2D are required for the binding of H3K27 acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and/or p300 on enhancers, enhancer activation, and enhancer-promotor looping prior to gene transcription. The KMT2C and KMT2D proteins, rather than the KMT2C and KMT2D-mediated H3K4me1, control p300 recruitment to enhancers, enhancer activation, and transcription from promoters in embryonic stem cells.  Functions = Development = Whole-body knockout of Kmt2d in mice results in early embryonic lethality. Targeted knockout of Kmt2d in precursors cells of brown adipocytes and myocytes results in decreases in brown adipose tissue and muscle mass in mice, indicating that KMT2D is required for adipose and muscle tissue development. In the hearts of mice, a single copy of the Kmt2d gene is sufficient for normal heart development. Complete loss of Kmt2d in cardiac precursors and myocardium leads to severe cardiac defects and early embryonic lethality. KMT2D mediated mono- and di-methylation is required for maintaining necessary gene expression programs during heart development. Knockout studies in mice also show that KMT2D is required for proper B-cell development. = Cell fate transition = KMT2D is partially functionally redundant with KMT2C and is required for cell differentiation in culture. KMT2D regulates the induction of adipogenic and myogenic genes and is required for cell-type specific gene expression during differentiation. KMT2C and KMT2D are essential for adipogenesis and myogenesis. Similar functions are seen in neuronal and osteoblast differentiation. KMT2D facilitates cell fate transition by priming enhancers (through H3K4me1) for p300-mediated activation. For p300 to bind the enhancer, the physical presence of KMT2D, and not just the KMT2D-mediated H3K4me1, is required. However, KMT2D is dispensable for maintaining embryonic stem cell and somatic cell identity. = Metabolism = KMT2D is partially functionally redundant with KMT2C in the liver as well. Heterozygous Kmt2d+/- mice exhibit enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and increased serum bile acid. KMT2C and KMT2D are significant epigenetic regulators of the hepatic circadian clock and are co- activators of the circadian transcription factors retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-Œ± and -Œ≥. In mice, KMT2D also acts as a coactivator of PPARŒ≥ within the liver to direct over-nutrition induced steatosis. Heterozygous Kmt2d+/- mice exhibit resistance to over-nutrition induced hepatic steatosis. = Tumor suppression = KMT2C and KMT2D along with NCOA6 act as coactivators of p53, a well-established tumor suppressor and transcription factor, and are necessary for endogenous expression of p53 in response to doxorubicin, a DNA damaging agent. KMT2C and KMT2D have also been implicated with tumor suppressor roles in acute myeloid leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Knockout of Kmt2d in mice negatively affects the expression of tumor suppressor genes TNFAIP3, SOCS3, and TNFRSF14. Conversely, KMT2D deficiency in several breast and colon cancer cell lines leads to reduced proliferation. Increased KMT2D was shown to facilitate chromatin opening and recruitment of transcription factors, including estrogen receptor (ER), in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Thus, KMT2D may have diverse effects on tumor suppression in different cell types.  Clinical significance  Loss of function mutations in KMT2D, also known as MLL2 in humans, have been identified in Kabuki syndrome, with mutational occurrence rates between 56% and 75%. Congenital heart disease has been associated with an excess of mutations in genes that regulate H3K4 methylation, including KMT2D. Frameshift and nonsense mutations in the SET and PHD domains affect 37% and 60%, respectively, of the total KMT2D mutations in cancers. Cancers with somatic mutations in KMT2D occur most commonly in the brain, lymph nodes, blood, lungs, large intestine, and endometrium.

Plot summary Don Hedger, an unknown painter, lives in a Washington Square. A new neighbour, Eden Bower, moves in. She upbraids him for showering his dog in the bath tub. Later he gets to doing some cleaning and finds a hole through the closet, which looks onto her room. He spies on her whilst she is doing yoga. Later he stalks her and she shows an interest in his paintings. They go to a restaurant together and become friends. One day, he goes to Coney Island to see a model of his, and she joins him. They go up in a balloon and she feels special until he tells her an atrocious story about Aztecs, which puts a damper on the whole day. Back in New York, they both sit on the roof and talk. Sometime later, she is back from Burton Ives's, a successful painter who has suggested helping him. Don gets angry with her as he deems Burton Ives to be a bad painter. He decides to leave to Long Island for a while, but eventually comes back because he wants to see her again. However, by then she has gone to Europe. Years later, Eden is back in New York after having great success in Paris. Whilst driving by Washington Square, she remembers her friend of old, and meets with Gaston Jules to ask him if her friend has gone up in the world. Don, she learns, is now a successful painter, even all the way to Paris, although he is considered avant-garde more than anything. Characters *Don Hedger. He lives on Washington Square.

Career After the time at his youth club FC Bazenheid Philipp Muntwiler moved to the U21 team of the then playing in the Super League FC St. Gallen. After a rather short loan commitment at FC Wil \\"Munti\\", as he is called by his fans, managed in the season 2005/06 under coach Ralf Loose the leap into the first team of FC St. Gallen and completed his first three appearances in the Super League. In the season 2006/07 Muntwiler developed both playful and tactically excellent and was already used in two-thirds of all games (24 of 36 games). However, another infernal highlight came in this year's football: Muntwiler indirectly decided the Swiss football championship on 1 April 2007 by playing against FC Z√ºrich, having been relegated to the field U21 in a match the day before was not eligible to play. However, the sporting department of FC St. Gallen had not turned to the right authority in the determination of whether the player may be used or not. Muntwiler came on in the scoreless game against FCZ about fifteen minutes before the end; In retrospect, the Swiss Football League Disciplinary Commission rated the match as a 3:0 -forfait victory for the Z√ºrich team. The FC Z√ºrich won the championship in a row with a point advantage over FC Basel. In the season 2007/08, Muntwiler made further progress and secured, then under Rolf Fringer, a regular place in the defensive midfield. With his successor Krassimir Balakov, however, he got off to the Challenge League. However, his involvement in St. Gallen did not detract from that; on the contrary: Muntwiler extended his contract prematurely in autumn 2008 for one year until 30 June 2010. One year after the descent, the FCSG again managed to be top class for two years. In 2011, however, the eastern Swiss rose again. Muntwiler moved in the summer of 2012 to FC Luzern. In September 2013, he transferred on loan to FC Vaduz in the Challenge League where he was allowed to celebrate at the end of the 2013/14 season promotion to the Swiss Super League. The FC Vaduz then committed him in the summer of 2014 definitely. He signed a contract for two years until summer 2016 and extended it early by one year until June 2017.

Milolii is an unincorporated community on the island of Hawaii in the U.S. state of Hawaii, 33 miles south of Kailua-Kona. The village is situated at the seacoast where the 1926 lava flow from Mauna Loa entered the ocean. Milolii is purported to be \\"the last Hawaiian fishing village\\" according to a wooden sign in their community center.Gorry, Conner and Julies Jares. Hawai'i: The Big Island. Oakland: Lonely Planet Publications, 2002. Without access to power lines or water, each house provides its own electricity and water with solar panels and tanks that collect rain water. On February 5, 1868 a tsunami carried a church, named Hauoli Kamanao and swept it away to Milolii. Surprisingly, the church remained in good condition and still stands in Milolii today. One little bit of celebrity came to Milolii in 1962 when the village was selected for background scenery in the Elvis Presley movie \\"Girls! Girls! Girls!\\" A Hollywood film crew spent several weeks in Milolii, with one house in the village used as the home of the Elvis character in the film. Ultimately, only a tiny bit of the Milolii footage actually appeared in the movie, offering just a fleeting glimpse (a few seconds on screen) of the village beach early in the film. The songbird of Milolii residence, Diana Aki, became a successful singer of Hawaiian music. In the late 1970s she recorded a few records, was featured in a documentary and she also performed in dinner shows at various resort hotels in Hawaii, primarily Kailua-Kona. The unofficial Mayor is Uncle Willy Kaupiko. Milolii was also the focus of a UCLA anthropological research project in the mid-1970s.

It is collated by the CFTC from submissions from traders in the market and covers positions in futures on grains, cattle, financial instruments, metals, petroleum and other commodities. The exchanges that trade futures are primarily based in Chicago and New York. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) releases a new report every Friday at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time, and the report reflects the commitments of traders on the prior Tuesday. The weekly Commitments of Traders report is sometimes abbreviated as \\"CoT\\" or \\"COT.\\" The report was first published in June 1962, but versions of the report can be traced back to as early as 1924 when the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Grain Futures Administration started regularly publishing a Commitments of Traders report. Methodology The weekly report details trader positions in most of the futures contract markets in the United States. Data for the report is required by the CFTC from traders in markets that have 20 or more traders holding positions large enough to meet the reporting level established by the CFTC for each of those markets.1 These data are gathered from schedules electronically submitted each week to the CFTC by market participants listing their position in any market for which they meet the reporting criteria. The report provides a breakdown of aggregate positions held by three different types of traders: ‚Äúcommercial traders,‚Äù ‚Äúnon-commercial traders‚Äù and ‚Äúnonreportable.‚Äù ‚ÄúCommercial traders‚Äù are sometimes called ‚Äúhedgers‚Äù, ‚Äúnon-commercial traders‚Äù are sometimes known as ‚Äúlarge speculators,‚Äù and the ‚Äúnonreportable‚Äù group is sometimes called ‚Äúsmall speculators.‚Äù As one would expect, the largest positions are held by commercial traders that actually provide a commodity or instrument to the market or have bought a contract to take delivery of it. Thus, as a general rule, more than half the open interest in most of these markets is held by commercial traders. There is also participation in these markets by speculators that are not able to deliver on the contract or that have no need for the underlying commodity or instrument. They are buying or selling only to speculate that they will exit their position at a profit, and plan to close their long or short position before the contract becomes due. In most of these markets the majority of the open interest in these \\"speculator\\" positions are held by traders whose positions are large enough to meet reporting requirements. The remainder of holders of contracts in these futures markets, other than \\"commercial\\" and \\"large speculator\\" traders, are referred to by the CFTC as ‚Äúnonreportable.‚Äù This is because they don‚Äôt meet the position size that requires reporting to the CFTC. (Thus they are ‚Äúsmall speculators.‚Äù) The ‚Äúnonreportable‚Äù open interest in a futures market is determined by subtracting the open interest of the ‚Äúcommercial traders‚Äù plus ‚Äúnon-commercial traders‚Äù from the total open interest in that market. As a rule, the aggregate of all traders‚Äô positions reported to the CFTC represents 70 to 90 percent of the total open interest in any given market.2 Since 1995 the Commitments of Traders report includes holdings of options as well as futures contracts. Purposes and uses Many speculative traders use the Commitments of Traders report to help them decide whether or not to take a long or short position. One theory is that \\"small speculators\\" are generally wrong and that the best position is contrary to the net non-reportable position. Another theory is that commercial traders understand their market the best and taking their position has a better chance of profit (which is pretty much the same thing as the \\"small speculators\\" being wrong).

It is also known as Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 3 (MST-3). The protein is 443 amino acids long and its mass is 49 kDa.  Classification and discovery  The yeast 'Sterile 20' gene (STE20) functions upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In mammals, protein kinases related to STE20 can be divided into 2 subfamilies based on their structure and regulation. Members of the PAK subfamily (see PAK3) contain a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain that has a CDC42-binding domain. In contrast, members of the GCK subfamily (MAP4K2), also called the Sps1 subfamily, have an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain without a CDC42-binding domain. STK24 belongs to the GCK subfamily of STE20-like kinases. The sterile 20 protein was first found in yeast. The MST-20 related kinases family is growing, having 28 members divided into two groups - p21-activated kinase and germinal center kinase (GCK) families. STK24 belongs to the germinal center kinase (GCK) III subfamily of sterile 20 kinases.  Function  Kinases of GCKIII subfamily are involved in regulation of multiple functions of the cells and interaction with programmed cell death 10 (CCM3). CCM is a pathological vascular situation that, influencing the blood vessels in central nervous system (CNS), may cause stroke, seizure and even cerebral hemorrhage. It has been shown that STK24 and STK25 operate in the same cardiovascular development pathway with CCM3. According to the results of the experiment by Zhang et al., lack of STK24 has no effect on the amount of neutrophils or leucocytes, as well as it does not affect the chemotaxis of neutrophils. Zhang et al. also the interaction between STK24 and CCM. Using tandem affinity purification with mass spectrometry, they found that CCM3 is the main protein that binds to STK24 in HEK293 cells. STK24 operates on serine and threonine residues and, as a response to oxidative stress and caspase activity, develops cell death. STK24 is activated by autophosphorylation at Thr-190 and phosphorylation at this site is essential for its function. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A activates the isoform B of STK24. The mutagenesis of four residues in STK24 have been carried out. In position 18, the replacement of threonine (T) with alanine (A) causes the reduction of phosphorylation by PKA. the modification in positions 65, where lysine (K) is replaced with A, and the position 190, where T is replaced with A, affects the activity and autophosphorylation. In residue 321, the change of aspartic acid (D) to Asparagine (N) reveals as loss of proteolytic cleavage by caspases. Those residues may play an important role apoptotic signal transduction.  Structure and tissue distribution  STK24 has two subunits, 36kDa N-terminal subunit and 12 kDa C-terminal subunit. In the cells, STK24 is located in nucleus and less in cytoplasm and membrane. There are two isoforms of the protein, isoform A is ubiquitous and is expressed in 237 organs, isoform B is expressed in brain hippocampus and cerebral cortex.  Interactions  STK24 has been shown to interact with PDCD10, TRAF3IP3, STRN3, MOBKL3, STRN, SLMAP, PPP2R1A, CTTNBP2NL, FAM40A and STRN4.

The 10th Jat Regiment was in charge of the security. Indoctrinated by Jatindranath Mukherjee, its soldiers decided to blow up the ballroom and take advantage of destroying the colonial Government. In keeping with his predecessor Otto (William Oskarovich) von Klemm, a friend of Lokamanya Tilak, on 6 February 1910, M. Arsenyev, the Russian Consul-General, wrote to St Petersburg that it had been intended to \\"arouse in the country a general perturbation of minds and, thereby, afford the revolutionaries an opportunity to take the power in their hands.\\" According to R. C. Majumdar, \\"The police had suspected nothing and it is hard to say what the outcome would have been had the soldiers not been betrayed by one of their comrades who informed the authorities about the impending coup\\". The second Christmas Day plot was to initiate an insurrection in Bengal in British India during World War I with German arms and support. Scheduled for Christmas Day, 1915, the plan was conceived and led by the Jugantar group under the Bengali Indian revolutionary Jatindranath Mukherjee, to be coordinated with simultaneous uprising in the British colony of Burma and Kingdom of Siam under direction of the Ghadar Party, along with a German raid on the South Indian city of Madras and the British penal colony in Andaman Islands. The aim of the plot was to seize the Fort William, isolate Bengal and capture the capital city of Calcutta, which was then to be used as a staging ground for a pan-Indian revolution. The Christmas Day plot was one of the later plans for pan-Indian mutiny during the war that were coordinated between the Indian nationalist underground, the \\"Indian independence committee\\" set up by the Germans in Berlin, the Ghadar Party in North America, and the German Foreign office. The plot was ultimately thwarted after British intelligence uncovered the plot through German and Indian double agents in Europe and Southeast Asia. Background The growth of the Indian middle class during the 19th century, amidst competition among regional powers and the ascendancy of the British East India Company, led to a growing sense of \\"Indian\\" identity. The refinement of this perspective fed a rising tide of nationalism in India in the last decades of the 19th century. Its speed was abetted by the creation of the Indian National Congress in India in 1885 by A. O. Hume. The Congress developed into a major platform for the demands of political liberalisation, increased autonomy and social reform. However, the nationalist movement became particularly strong, radical and violent in Bengal and, later, in Punjab. Notable, if smaller, movements also appeared in Maharashtra, Madras and other areas in the South. Political terrorism began taking an organised form in Bengal at the beginning of the 20th century. By 1902, Calcutta had three societies working under the umbrella of Anushilan Samiti, a society earlier founded by a Calcutta barrister by the name of Pramatha Mitra. These included Mitra's own group, another led by a Bengalee lady by the name of Sarala Devi, and a third one led by Aurobindo Ghosh, one of the strongest proponents of militant nationalism of the time. In Bengal, militant nationalism took an organised form at the beginning of the twentieth century. The chief apostle of militant nationalism in Bengal was Aurobindo Ghose. In 1902, there were three secret societies in Calcutta - Anushilan Samiti, founded by Pramatha Mitra, a barrister of the High Court of Calcutta; a society sponsored by Aurobindo Ghosh and a society started by Sarala Devi ... government found it difficult to suppress revolutionary activities in Bengal owing to ... leaders like Jatindranath Mukherjee, Rashbehari Bose and Jadugopal Mukherjee. By 1905, the works of Aurobindo and his brother Barin Ghosh allowed Anushilan Samity to spread through Bengal. The controversial 1905 partition of Bengal had a widespread political impact: it stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in the Bhadralok community in Bengal, and helped Anushilan acquire a support base amongst of educated, politically conscious and disaffected young in local youth societies of Bengal. The Dhaka branch of Anushilan was led by Pulin Behari Das and spread branches through East Bengal and Assam. Aurobindo and Bipin Chandra Pal, a Bengali politician, began in 1907 the radical Bengali nationalist publication of Jugantar (\\"Change\\"), and its English counterpart Bande Mataram. Among the early recruits who emerged noted leaders were Rash Behari Bose, Jatindranath Mukherjee, and Jadugopal Mukherjee. Anushilan, notably from early on, established links with foreign movements and Indian nationalism abroad. In 1907, Barin Ghosh arranged to send to Paris one of his associates by the name of Hem Chandra Kanungo (Hem Chandra Das), he was to learn the art of bomb-making from Nicholas Safranski, a Russian revolutionary in exile in the French Capital. Paris was also home at the time Madam Cama who was amongst the leading figures of the Paris Indian Society and the India House in London. The bomb manual later found its way through V. D. Savarkar to the press at India House for mass printing. In the meantime, in December 1907 the Bengal revolutionary cell derailed the train carrying the Bengal Lieutenant Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Anushilan also engaged at this time in a number of notable incidences of political assassinations and dacoities to obtain funds. The first such dacoity was committed by Naren ... Around this time, revolutionaries threw a bomb at the carriage of Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy ... in Muzaffarpur, under the mistaken notion that the 'notorious' Magistrate Kingsford was in the carriage ... Nandalal Banerjee, an officer in the Intelligence Branch of the Bengal Police was shot dead by Naren. This was, however, the crest for Anushilan. In 1908, two young recruits, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki were sent on a mission to Muzaffarpur to assassinate the Chief Presidency Magistrate D.H. Kingsford. The duo bombed a carriage they mistook as Kingsford's, killing two English women in it. In the aftermath of the murder, Khudiram Bose was arrested while attempting to flee, while Chaki took his own life. Narendra Nath Bhattacharya, then a member of the group, shot dead Nandalal Bannerjee, the officer who had arrested Khudiram. Police investigations into the murders revealed the organisations quarters in Maniktala suburb of Calcutta and led to a number of arrests, opening the famous Alipore Conspiracy trial. Some of its leadership were executed or incarcerated, while others went underground. Aurobindo Ghosh himself retired from active politics after serving a prison sentence, his brother Barin was imprisoned for life. Jatindra Nath Mukherjee escaped arrest in the Alipore case, and took over the leadership of the secret society, to be known as the Jugantar Party. He revitalised the links between the central organisation in Calcutta and its several branches spread all over Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and several places in Uttar Pradesh, and opened hideouts in the Sundarbans for members who had gone undergroundM. N. Roy's Memoirs p3 The group slowly reorganised guided Mukherjee's efforts of aided by an emerging leadership which included Amarendra Chatterjee, Naren Bhattacharya and other younger leaders. Some of its younger members including Tarak Nath Das left India, to prepare scopes abroad. Through the next two years, the organisation operated under the covers of two seemingly detached organisations, Sramajeebi Samabaya (The Labourer's Cooperative) and Harry & Sons. Aurobihdo's retirement from active politics after his acquittal ... Two centres were established, one was the Sramajibi Samabaya ... and the other in the name of S.D. Harry and Sons... Naren committed several dacoities to raise funds, for political activities. Since 1906, Jatin Mukherjee had been attempting to establish contacts with the 10th Jat Regiment then garrisoned at Fort William in Calcutta. Narendra Nath carried out through this time a number of robberies to obtain funds. In the meantime, however, a second blow came in 1910 when Shamsul Alam, a Bengal Police officer then preparing a conspiracy case against the group, was assassinated by an associate of Jatin Mukherjee by the name of Biren Dutta Gupta. The assassination led to the arrests which ultimately precipitated the Howrah-Sibpur Conspiracy Case. Shamsul Alam, an Intelligence officer who was then preparing to arrest all the revolutionaries ... was murdered by Biren Datta Gupta, one of Jatin Mukherjee's associates. This led to the arrests in the Howrah Conspiracy case. Pre-war developments While incarcerated during the Howrah-Sibpur conspiracy trial, a nucleus emerged within the party comprising the most militant of the nationalists. These developed from early ideas initially mooted by Barin Ghosh. This nucleus foresaw the possibilities of an Anglo-German war in the near-future, and around this the revolutionaries intended to launch a guerilla war with assistance from Germany. The earlier revolutionaries did not concern themselves with anything beyond terrorising British administrators. The Howrah conspirators were not content with mere terrorism and held much deeper political motives and aspirations. The Howrah case revealed that the groups were actively planning an insurrection against the government through building a nucleus of organisational networks throughout Bengal and maintaining links with other parts of the country; The trial brought to attention the direction the group headed, moving away from the efforts of the early revolutionaries which aimed to merely terrorise the British administration. The nucleus that arose during the trial held deeper political motives and aspirations, and built on this nucleus to develop an organisational network throughout Bengal and other parts of India. The Howrah conspirators were released after about a year when the Howrah-Sibpur case collapsed due to lack of evidence. Released in February 1911, Jatin Mukherjee suspended all overtly violent activities. Suspended from his government job, Jatin began a business, working as a contractor for the railway network in Bengal, a job which allowed him to roam the Bengal countryside identifying suitable spots for the revolutionary projects he was planning. In 1906, an early Anushilan member Jatindranath Banerjee (known as Niralamba Swami) had left Bengal in the guise of a Sanyasi, making his way to the United Provinces and subsequently Punjab. At Punjab, Niralamba established links with Sardar Ajit Singh and Bhai Kishen Singh (father of Bhagat Singh). Through Kishen Singh, the Bengal revolutionary cell was introduced to Lala Har Dayal when the latter visited India briefly in 1908. Jatindranath Banerjee became a sanyasi in 1906 and went to the United Provinces (UP) and Punjab to preach revolution. Banerjee was able to convert Ajit Sirigh and his brother Kissen Singh (father of Bhagat Singh), Lala Hardayal, on his return to India in 1908, also became interested in the programme of the Bengal revolutionaries through Kissen Singh. Har Dayal himself was associated with the India House, a revolutionary organisation in London then under V. D. Savarkar; Dayal was proud that by 1910, he had worked closely with Rash Behari Bose. Bose was a Jugantar member employed at the Forest institute at Dehradun, who worked, possibly independent of Jatin Mukherjee, on the revolutionary movement in UP and Punjab since October 1910. The India House itself was liquidated in 1910 in the aftermath of Sir W. H. Curzon Wyllie's assassination in the hands of Madanlal Dhingra, a member of the London group. Among the India House group who fled Britain was V. N. Chetterjee, who left for Germany. Har Dayal himself moved to San Francisco after working briefly with the Paris Indian Society. In the United States, nationalism among Indian immigrants, particularly students and working classes, was gaining ground. Tarak Nath Das, who had left Bengal for the United States in 1907, was among the noted Indian leaders who engaged in political work, maintaining contact with Sri Aurobindo and Jatin Mukherjee. In California, Har Dayal's arrival bridged a gap between the intellectual agitators in the west coast and the lower classes in the Pacific coast. Welcomed by Taranath Das, he emerged a leading organiser of Indian nationalism amongst the predominantly immigrant labour workers from India, founding the Ghadar movement. Meanwhile, in 1912, Jatin met in the company of Naren Bhattacharya the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that arms and ammunition would be supplied to them.Terrorism in Bengal, Compiled and Edited by A.K. Samanta, Government of West Bengal, 1995, Vol. II, p625. The October of the same year, Rash Behari visited Lahore, rallying Har Dayal's group and beginning a campaign of revolutionary violence marked most dramatically by an attempt on the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge in December 1912. Rash Behari's associate Basanta Biswas - sent by Amarendra Chatterjee, had belonged to Jatin Mukherjee's circle of followers. Niralamba Swami informed Jatin Mukherjee further about the activities in North India when they met, on a pilgrimage to the holy Hindu city of Brindavan. Returning to Bengal, in 1913, Jatin began organising a grand scale relief in the flood-stricken areas around the Damodar. Rash Behari had gone into hiding in Benares after the 1912 attempt on Hardinge, but he joined Jatin Mukherjee on this occasion. Acknowledging in Jatin Mukherjee the true leader of the people, Bose met him several times towards the end of 1913, outlining the prospects of a pan-Indian revolution of 1857 style. World War I In response to Britain's entry to the war on the side of France, Germany had begun actively considering efforts to weaken the British war efforts by targeting her colonial empire. Germany nurtured links with India nationalists before the war, seeing India as a potential weakness for Britain. In the immediate period preceding the war, Indian nationalist groups had used Germany as a base and potential support. As early as 1913, revolutionary literature referred to the approaching war between Germany and England and the possibility of obtaining German help for the Indian movement. In the early months of the war, German newspapers also devoted considerable coverage to Indian distress, social problems, and colonial exploitation by Britain. The Indian situation featured in the German war strategy. The German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg finally authorised German activity against India in the early weeks of the war, and decision was taken to offer active support to the Indian Nationalists. Through the newly formed Intelligence Bureau for the East, headed by prominent archaeologist and historian Max von Oppenheim, Germany contemplated plans for nationalist unrest in India. Oppenheim helped the formation of the Berlin Committee formed by C. R. Pillai. Among the members of this group was V. N. Chatterjee of London India House. Har Dayal himself had fled the United States for Switzerland after he was arrested on the charge of being an anarchist. He left the Ghadar party in charge of Ram Chandra Bharadwaj, and from Switzerland, he agreed to support the Berlin Committee. Through Indian emissaries and through staff of the German consulate at San Francisco, contacts were established with the Ghadar Party. Germany offered to aid in finances, arms, and military advisors to plans considered between the German foreign office, Berlin Committee, and the Indian Ghadar Party in North America to clandestinely ship arms and men to India from United States and the Orient with which they hoped to trigger a nationalist mutiny in India in 1914-15, on the lines of the 1857 uprising. At the time the war broke out, Jugantar, in a convened meeting, elected Jatin Mukherjee the supreme commander. The German consulate in Calcutta was at this time able to establish contacts with Jatin who, encouraged by Sir Ashutosh, had met D. Thibault, the Registrar of Calcutta University. The Consul General reported back to Berlin that the Bengal revolutionary cell was significant enough to be considered for active support in undermining the British war effort. Satyen Sen joined the group in San Francisco at that time. Sen was sent to America by Jatin Mukherjee to establish contacts with the Ghadr Party. In November 1914 Satyen Sen returned to Calcutta with information about support from the Sikh community in the USA and Canada and introduced their leader Kartar Singh to Naren and Jatin Mukherjee in Calcutta... The German Consul General contacted the Bengal revolutionaries through D. Thibault, then Registrar of Calcutta University and Naren went to talk to him. After discussions with-the German diplomat, Naren requested Jatin Mukherjee, who was engaged in business in Jessore, to come to Calcutta. The German Consul General reported to Berlin that 'the activities of the secret revolutionary societies [were] very significant, especially those of Bengal' and recommended that his 'Government should avail itself of this opportunity of undermining British power and should help these revolutionaries actively'... Jatin Mukherjee had in the meanwhile been elected supreme commander in a hurriedly convened, meeting of different groups and leaders of Bengal. Jugantar began a campaign of politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds and arms in August. On 26 August, the Calcutta store of Rodda & co, one of the biggest arms stores in Calcutta, was looted. The raiders made off with ten cases of arms and ammunition, including 50 Mauser Pistols and 46,000 rounds of ammunition. =Ghadar= Jatin's cousin Dhan Gopal Mukerji, then a student at UC Berkeley, had already been in the United States for some time. In 1914, Jatin sent to San Francisco a party member by the name of Satyendra Sen with the purpose of contacting the Ghadar party. Sen returned in November 1914, with information on the plans being implemented by the Berlin Committee headed by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and the German military attach√© Franz von Papen at Washington, to purchase a huge consignment arms to be sent to India by sea. $200,000 worth of small arms and ammunition had been earlier acquired by him through Krupp agents, and arranged for its shipment to India through San Diego, Java, and Burma. The arsenal included 8,080 Springfield rifles of Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War vintage, 2,400 Springfield carbines, 410 Hotchkiss repeating rifles, 4,000,000 cartridges, 500 Colt revolvers with 100,000 cartridges, and 250 Mauser pistols along with ammunition. Sen had also introduced to Jatin a Ghadarite leader, Kartar Singh Sarabha, who had returned to India to co-ordinate the plans for the proposed revolt with the Indian underground. Ghadarites, most of them Indian expatriates from Punjab, were pouring into India via Calcutta, tasked to mobilise Sepoys of the Indian army, preparing for mutiny in the army centres in the North Indian region of Punjab. The Commander-in-Chief Jatin Mukherjee was to co-ordinate with this to draw on the Indian army in the east, in Bengal. The plot in Upper India was being coordinated by Rash Behari from United Provinces, and was ably supported by Vishnu Ganesh Pingle, another Ghadarite who too returned to India in November 1914 from the United States, and by Sachindra Nath Sanyal (of the Dhaka Anusilan Samiti) who worked from Benares. Bose coordinated with Jatin, and the latter himself was to lead Bengal into mutiny. The mutiny was scheduled for late February 1915, beginning with Indian army units in Punjab, followed by units in Bengal. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately. Units as far as Rangoon and Singapore were part of the Rash Behari's plan. However, Rash Behari's plans for mutiny failed when, in February 1915, in a situation simmering in Punjab, Ghadar rose prematurely even before Papen had arranged to ship his arsenal. Set for 21 February 1915, details of the date and places found their way to Punjab CID through a spy, Kirpal Singh, recruited at the last minute. Sensing infiltration, a desperate Rash Behari brought forward the D-Day to the 19th, but incautiousness allowed Kirpal to report back to Punjab police in the nick of time. Mutiny in Punjab was crushed on the 19th, followed by suppression of smaller revolts throughout North India. The Singapore garrison managed to revolt openly and held out for some time before it was crushed six days later. Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces. Key leaders of the conspiracy, including Kartar Singh, Pingle, Kanshi Ram, Bhai Bhagwan Singh and others were arrested. Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan. Other leaders, including Giani Pritam Singh, Swami Satyananda Puri and others fled to Thailand. Jatin Mukherjee and the rest of the Bengal cell went underground. =Autumn 1915= In the aftermath of the failed February mutiny, concerted efforts attempted to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement. Preoccupied by the increasing police activities to prevent any uprising, eminent Jugantar members suggested that Jatin move to a safer place. Balasore on the Orissa coast was selected as a suitable place, being very near the spot where German arms were to be landed for the Indian rising. To facilitate the transmission of information to Jatin Mukherjee, a business house under the name \\"Universal Emporium\\" was set up, as a branch of Harry & Sons in Calcutta, created in order to keep contacts with revolutionaries abroad. Jatin, therefore, moved to a hideout outside Kaptipada village in the native state of Mayurbhanj, more than thirty miles away from Balasore. In the meantime, Papen, in Liaison with Chandrakanta Chakrabarti, the self-styled agent of the Berlin Committee in United States, arranged for the first shipment of arms aboard the schooner Annie Larsen under a successful cover set up to lead British agents to believe that the arms were for the warring factions of the Mexican Civil War. Under an elaborate deception, the schooner left San Diego sometime in March 1915 to rendezvous in secret with a second ship, the oil tanker off Socorro Island near Mexico. Maverick was to sail to Dutch East Indies. Disastrous co-ordination prevented a successful rendezvous off Socorro Island. After waiting for the Maverick for a month, Annie Larsen returned to San Diego to be told to return to the island and wait for the tanker. Maverick, in the meantime, reached the rendezvous a month late, having been held up at port by repair work. Unable to find the schooner, she set sail across the Pacific, hoping to pick up the trail at Hawaii. Annie Larsens second voyage meanwhile failed when she ran into headstrong winds. Returning to Hoquiam, Washington, after a number of failed attempts, the Annie Larsen's cargo was promptly seized by US customs who were intimated by British intelligence. Maverick made across the Pacific for the Dutch East Indies, but her Captain had no way of forewarning the Germans there that she came not with the arms they expected, but only bales of revolutionary literature and a handful of Indian revolutionaries. In April 1915, unaware of the failure of the Annie Larsen plan, Papen arranged, through Krupp's American representative Hans Tauscher, a second shipment of arms, consisting of 7,300 Springfield rifles, 1,930 pistols, 10 Gatling guns and nearly 3,000,000 cartridges. The arms were to be shipped in mid June to Surabaya in the East Indies on the Holland American steamship SS Djember. Christmas Day plot German agents in Thailand and Burma included Emil and Theodor Helferrich‚Äî brothers of the German Finance minister Karl Helfferich. Through a Jugantar member named Jitendranath Lahiri, the Helferrichs had been able to establish links with Jatin Mukherjee in March 1915. In April Jatin sent to Batavia Jitendra Nath and Narendranath Bhattacharya, the latter by then his chief lieutenant. Through the German Consul, Narendranath met with the Helfferich brothers in Batavia and was informed of the expected arrival of the Maverick with arms. The duo were to guide the Maverick, when she arrived, to the coast of the Bay of Bengal. In April, 1915, following instructions from Chatto passed on through, in order to make a deal with the German authorities concerning financial aid and the supply of arms. Although these were originally intended for Ghadar use, the Berlin Committee modified the plans, to have arms shipped into India to the eastern coast of India, through Hatia on the Chittagong coast, Raimangal in the Sundarbans and Balasore in Orissa, instead of Karachi as had been originally decided. From the coast of the Bay of Bengal, these were to be collected by Jatin's group. For this purpose, Ashwini Lal Roy was sent to Raimangal to receive the maverick.Portrait of a Bengali Revolutionary\\": A Rejoinder. Samaren Roy.The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Feb. 1969), pp. 367-372. p371 Jugantar also received funds (estimated to be Rs 33,000 between June and August 1915) from The Helfferich brothers through Harry & sons in Calcutta. =Bengal= The date of insurrection was fixed for Christmas Day of 1915. Jatin estimated that he would be able to win over the 14th Rajput Regiment in Calcutta and cut the line to Madras at Balasore and thus take control of Bengal. =Burma= To provide the Bengal group enough time to capture Calcutta and to prevent reinforcements from being rushed in, mutiny was planned for Burma with arms smuggled in from Neutral Thailand. This Siam-Burma plan originated early in October 1914 from the Ghadar Party and was finally concluded in January 1915. Ghadarites from branches in China and United States, including leaders like Atma Ram, Thakar Singh, and Banta Singh from Shanghai and Santokh Singh and Bhagwan Singh from San Francisco, attempted to infiltrate Burma Military Police in Thailand, which was composed mostly of Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims. Early in 1915, Atma Ram had also visited Calcutta and Punjab and linked up with the revolutionary underground there, including Jugantar. Herambalal Gupta and the German consul at Chicago arranged to have German operatives George Paul Boehm, Henry Schult, and Albert Wehde sent to Siam through Manila with the purpose of training the Indians. Santokh Singh returned to Shanghai tasked to send two expeditions, one to reach the Indian border via Yunnan and the other to penetrate upper Burma and join with revolutionary elements there. The Germans, while in Manila, also attempted to transfer the arms cargo of two German ships, the Sachsen and the Suevia, to Siam in a schooner seeking refuge at Manila harbour. However, US customs stopped these attempts. In the meantime, with the help of the German Consul to Thailand Remy, the Ghadarite established a training headquarters in the jungles near the Thai-Burma border for Ghadarites arriving from China and Canada. German Consul General at Shanghai, Knipping, sent three officers of the Peking Embassy Guard for training and in addition arranged for a Norwegian agent in Swatow to smuggle arms through. =Andaman= At the same time that Jatin's group was to strike in Bengal, a German raid was planned for the penal colony in the Andaman islands. This was to be carried out with a German volunteer force raised from East Indies which would release the political prisoners to raise an expeditionary Indian force that would threaten the Indian coast. The plan was proposed by Vincent Kraft, a German planter in Batavia who had been wounded fighting in France. It was approved by the foreign office on 14 May 1915, after consultation with the Indian committee, and raid was planned for Christmas Day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred Germans led by a former naval officer von M√ºller was raised. Knipping made plans for shipping arms to the Andaman islands. However, Vincent Kraft was a double agent, and leaked details of Knippings plans to British intelligence. His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by \\"Oren\\", but given the successive failures of the Indo-German plans, the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping. Culmination The Christmas Day plot was ultimately leaked out through a number of sources. The earliest information was received on the details of the cargo being carried by the Maverick and of Jugantar's plans that were leaked to Beckett, the British Consul at Batavia, by a defecting Baltic-German agent under the alias \\"Oren\\". The Maverick was seized and alerts were sounded to British Indian police. Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured. Maps of the Bengal coast were found on Kraft when he was initially arrested and he volunteered the information that these were the intended landing sites for German arms. As soon as the information reached the British authorities, they alerted the police, particularly in the delta region of the Ganges, and sealed off all the sea approaches on the eastern coast from the Noakhali‚ÄìChittagong side to Orissa. Harry & Sons was raided and searched, and the police found a clue which led them to Kaptipada village, where Jatin was staying with Manoranjan Sengupta and Chittapriya Ray Chaudhuri; a unit of the Police Intelligence Department was dispatched to Balasore. =Jatin Mukherjee's death= Jatin was kept informed and was requested to leave his hiding place, but his insistence on taking Niren and Jatish with him delayed his departure by a few hours, by which time a large force of police, headed by top European officers from Calcutta and Balasore, reinforced by the army unit from Chandbali in Mayurbhanj State, had reached the neighbourhood. Jatin and his companions walked through the forests and hills of Mayurbhanj, and after two days reached Balasore Railway Station. The police had announced a reward for the capture of five fleeing \\"bandits\\", so the local villagers were also in pursuit. With occasional skirmishes, the revolutionaries, running through jungles and marshy land in torrential rain, finally took up position on 9 September 1915 in an improvised trench in undergrowth on a hillock at Chashakhand in Balasore. Chittapriya and his companions asked Jatin to leave and go to safety while they guarded the rear. Jatin refused to leave them, however. The contingent of Government forces approached them in a pincer movement. A gunfight ensued, lasting seventy-five minutes, between the five revolutionaries armed with Mauser pistols and the large number of police and army armed with modern rifles. It ended with an unrecorded number of casualties on the Government side; on the revolutionary side, Chittapriya Ray Chaudhuri died, Jatin and Jatish were seriously wounded, and Manoranjan Sengupta and Niren were captured after their ammunition ran out. Bagha Jatin died, killed by police bullets, in Balasore hospital on 10 September 1915. =Siam Burma plan= In the meantime, the Thai Police high command, which was largely British, discovered the plans for the Burmese insurrection, and Indian police infiltrated the plot through an Indian secret agent who was revealed the details by the Austrian charg√© d'affaires. Thailand, although officially neutral, was allied closely with Britain and British India. On 21 July, the newly arrived British Minister Herbert Dering presented Foreign Minister Prince Devawongse with the request for arrest and extradition of Ghadarites identified by the Indian agent, ultimately resulting in the arrest of leading Ghadarites in August. Only a single raid into Burma was launched by six Ghadarites, who were captured and later hanged. Footnotes=References=    * *.

Contradiction matrix  Example of contents of Contradiction MatrixSavransky Engineering of Creativity A Contradiction Matrix is a structured and systematic representation of basic engineering parameters of objects, or systems, such as weight, length and manufacturing tolerances.  TRIZ  TRIZ claims that by studying an individual parameter that is causing a problem (e.g., the weight of an object needs to be reduced), and the other parameters with which it conflicts (e.g., the lower weight would require thinner material, which is more likely to undergo catastrophic failure), solutions can be created. And this is actually the simplification of some fact. Namely, the structured contents of each of the cells within the Contradiction Matrix, (i.e. cells fulfilled with ordered principles and identified by their order numbers) - the principles of inventions have been chosen, due to realized necessary statistical extensive studies.  History  Studies led by G. S. Altshuller led to this approach. According to Altshuller, every technical problem that requires a solution can be categorized in terms of what he called its Main Technical Contradiction. Altshuller proposed that the process of evolution of any given System is ruled by general 'Laws of Systems Evolution'. One such law says that the process of finding the solution can be facilitated by forming analogies to solutions that had already been found for another technical problem. However, the main point is to acquire the necessary experience in correctly defining the Main Technical Contradiction.

It is the French part of a proposed Seine- Scheldt canal that would ultimately connect the Rhine and Seine basins inland. The stated objective is to expand trade flows in a fuel-efficient and ecologically friendly manner between the Seine basin and Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, while reducing saturation on the A1 motorway in France and reducing the CO2 emissions in the transport sector within this corridor. The canal will be the French section of the Seine-Escaut (Scheldt) European waterway, which includes further major investments on the Canal Dunkerque- Escaut, on the Lys/Leie in Flanders and on the waterways in Wallonia. It will run 107 km from just north of Compi√®gne, to the Canal Dunkerque-Escaut, crossing the regions of Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The 107-kilometre-long canal will connect the Seine and Scheldt rivers and facilitate inland water transport. When the new Seine-Nord connection is ready, it will allow large vessels to transport goods between the Seine river (and the Paris area) and the ports of Dunkerque, Antwerp, and Rotterdam, or further into Europe. The canal will replace the Canal de Saint-Quentin and the current Canal du Nord, increasing maximum barge capacity from 650 to 4400 tonnes.VNF, 'The canal Seine-Nord Europe project planning regional, national and European' The canal will include several large structures, including six locks and three aqueducts: two over the A29 and A26 motorways, and one 1330 metres long over the Somme. The project‚Äôs budget will be ‚Ç¨4.7 billion, financed by the European Union, the French government, the Hauts-de-France and √éle-de-France regions and the d√©partements Oise, Somme, Pas-de-Calais and Nord. The project was called into question after a change of Government in July 2012, not per se but for its cost and the principle of a public-private partnership (PPP) which after the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was found to be unworkable. Significant cost reductions were deemed possible, and 'reconfiguration' of the project led to use of the line of the existing Canal du Nord over a length of about 8 km (5 mi), lowering the summit level by 18.50 metres and thus eliminating one lock. Engineers were selected for the project in June 2015. On 21 April 2016, an ordonnance was approved by the President of France, authorizing the construction of the canal and creating the Soci√©t√© du Canal Seine-Nord Europe to manage the project. Economic impact The existing Canal du Nord and parallel Canal de Saint-Quentin represent a bottleneck on one of Europe‚Äôs principal transport arteries. This is reflected in the current statistics: where the market share of inland water transport measured in tonne-kilometres reaches 18% in the Seine-Oise basin and 14% in Nord-Pas-de- Calais, and even more than 50% on the major waterways of Germany and Benelux, the constraints of carrying capacity on the corridor in France limit the waterway market share to between 3 and 4% (peaking at about 5 million tonnes). Traffic is projected to reach between 15 and 18 million tonnes per year a few years after the waterway has opened. Analysis by the European Court of Auditors published in 2020 , examined the economic case and stated that: \\"The Seine-Scheldt inland waterway link was approved on the basis that traffic levels on the Canal Seine Nord Europe by 2060 would be four times as high as the reference situation in 2030 without the Canal. To achieve this a significant increase in freight volumes on the axis across France and Europe is necessary. However, the statistics from the last decade do not suggest that this will occur. In addition, two specific conditions are necessary, none of which seem particularly realistic in the light of industrial trends over time: ‚Äî a fourfold increase ‚Äì from 2.3 million tonnes per year to 8.1 million tonnes per year ‚Äì in traditional flows of construction materials moved by inland waterways using the Canal Seine Nord Europe over the 30 years following entry into service. For such a significant modal shift to come about, various accompanying conditions (e.g. tolling) would need to be put in place. ‚Äî a massive diversion of containerised road traffic to waterways, resulting in 36 % of freight on the entire traffic axis being shifted onto the waterway. This would require the current proportion of freight carried by waterway on that axis to be multiplied by 38, or the share of container traffic volumes to be three times as high as it currently is for the entire Rhine river.\\" Environmental impact Voies navigables de France, the project authority, sets out the principal environmental impacts on the website dedicated to the project. The CO2 emissions of a barge carrying 1500 tonnes are three times less than those of the fleet of trucks required to move this load. A single push-tow 185 m long can carry 300 containers unloaded in a maritime port, compared to 5 fully loaded trains and 200 trucks.

In 2020, the network gathers 24 radio stations from 23 cities across 17 countries, speaking 10 different languages.German, English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Macedonian, Italian, Spanish, Slovene, Luxembourgish It also organizes linked-up events and special broadcasts. Radia intends to be a space of reflection about today's radio and radio art. Its activities try to contribute to intercultural exchange and artworks' and artists' circulation. The network's name freely refers to La Radia,La Radia Futurist manifesto of October 1933 by Federico Tomaso Marinetti and Pino Masnata (Originally published in \\"Gazzetta del Popolo\\") Futurist manifesto written by Federico Tomaso Marinetti and Pino Masnata in 1933. The network's founders dropped the La to distance themselves from the Futurists' political views. As it stands alone, \\"radia\\" is simply \\"radio\\" or \\"radios\\" in some languages.  Shows  The Radia Network's basis is a weekly 28 minutes show broadcast by all the stations. Each station produces the show in turns. Every round of shows is called a season. = Content = As stated in their jingle, Radia is \\"bringing new and forgotten ways of making radio to [their] listeners. Each week [they] give artists the challenge to make radio that works all across Europe and beyond.\\" The Radia show intends to cross boundaries and address people of different languages and cultures. It usually explores the different genres of radio art, separately or by mixing them: sound art, electroacoustic music, sound poetry, radio drama, soundscape. = Production = Usually each member radio station commissions an artist from their local artistic community and gives him/her carte blanche for producing a show. In that sense, Radia uses radio as a gallery for sound art pieces. = Exchange and archive = To share the shows the Radia Network formerly used Radioswap.net, a semi-public closed platform for program exchange between community radios. Now it utilizes the server space of one of its member stations. All Radia shows are archived at the Internet Archive.

It was promoted to the status of metropolitan archbishopric in 1982, and its name was changed from the Diocese of Penne e Pescara to Pescara-Penne.Archdiocese of Pescara-Penne: Creation of the Archdiocese That was in turn created in 1949, when the historic diocese of Penne-Atri was split up, with Atri going to form the Diocese of Teramo- Atri. The Diocese of Atri had been united with the Diocese of Penne in 1252. The seat of the archbishops is in the Pescara Cathedral. History The diocese of Penne was always immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy), except for the period 1526 to 1539, when it was subject to the archbishop of Chieti.Kehr, IV, p. 283. The diocese of Atri (Adriensis) was established by Cardinal Petrus Capoccius, Cardinal Deacon of S. Giorgio ad velum aureum, Legate of the Marches, under authority of Pope Innocent IV, on 1 April 1251 by the Bull Solet S. Mater. He appointed the church of S. Maria to be the new cathedral.Ughelli, I, pp. 1139-1141. In a letter to the people of Atri of 21 August 1251, Pope Innocent thanked them for their support against the attacks of the Emperor Frederick II.Ughelli, pp. 1141-1142. On 15 March 1252, the Pope united the diocese of Atri and the diocese of Penne in the person of one and the same bishop, aequaliter et personaliter.Ughelli, pp. 1138-1139. aequaliter et personaliter means that the two dioceses each retained its independent character and institutions, while having the same person as their bishop. In 1927, Pescara, the birthplace of the Fascist poet Gabriele d'Annunzio became the capital of a new province of the Italian state. On 2 June 1946, a plebiscite of the Italian peoples abolished the monarchy and established a republic. On 1 January 1948, the new constitution of the Italian Republic went into effect. The political changes had a notable effect on the arrangement of the ecclesiastical provinces in the Abruzzi, as Pope Pius XII was well aware. He was especially concerned about the substantial movement of population to Pescara in the first half of the 20th century, and the decision of the Italian government, partially due to destruction of parts of the area during the military operations of World War II, to direct its resources toward the rebuilding and improvement of Pescara. As the capital of a province, Pescara deserved to become the seat of a bishop; but the city extended over two different dioceses, Chieti and Penne.\\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\\": Hisce namque novissimis temporibus Piscar√≠a urbs dioecesis Pinnensis, quae ad maris Adriatici oras iacet, tale incrementum sumpsit, ut, magni facta nominis civitas, merito eiusdem nominis Provinciae caput evaserit. Haec Piscar√≠a urbs nunc ex unione efformata est duorum iam prius exsistentium oppidorum : quorum alterum, Piscar√≠a nuncupatum, ad Theatinam archidioecesim pertinet ; alterum vero, cui nomen Castrum Maris Adriatici, intra fines exstat dioecesis Pinnensis; ita ut nova Piscar√≠a urbs partim Archiepiscopi Theatini, partim Episcopi Pinnensis iurisdictioni subiecta est. The Pope, therefore decided on the rearrangement of the diocesan system, which he effected in the Bull Dioecesium subscriptiones of 1 July 1949.\\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\\", Acta Apostolicae Sedis 42 (1950), pp. 135‚Äì137. First of all, the Bull brought together all of the parishes of the city of Pescara, by transferring five parishes from the diocese of Chieti to the diocese of Penne. Second, the seat of the diocese of Penne was transferred from PennePenne was a town of only 14,000 persons in 1951. to the city of Pescara, and its name changed to Pinnensis-Piscarensis. Third, the parish of S. Cetteo in Pescara was elevated to the status of a cathedral, and the Chapter of the cathedral of Penne was transferred to S. Cetteo; the Archpriest of the Chapter was to be the parish priest of the cathedral. The cathedral in Penne was named a co-cathedral. The diocesan seminary was transferred to Pescara. Since the diocese of Atri was entirely in the civil province of Teramo, Atri was united aequaliter principaliter with the diocese of Teramo, forming the diocese of Teramo e Atri.\\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\\", p. 136, nos. 2-10. Pope John Paul II made additional changes in the ecclesiastical structure of the Abruzzi. In the Bull Ad majorem quidam of 2 March 1982, he created a new ecclesiastical province, and named the bishop of Penne-Pescara as the metropolitan archbishop. He assigned the diocese of Teramo e Altri, which had been immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy), as a suffragan of the new archdiocese. He also changed the name of the archdiocese from Penne-Pescara to Pescara-Penne. These changes divested the Papacy of the direct control of two more dioceses.Ad maiorem quidem, Acta Apostolicae Sedis 74 (1982), pp. 533‚Äì534. =Cathedral and Chapter= When the diocese of Atri was established in 1251, the number of Canons in the Chapter of the cathedral was fixed at twenty secular Canons. In electing a new bishop, the two Chapters of Canons were to vote together as one body. The number of electors from each Chapter was to be the same, even if one Chapter had more members than the other. For the first round of voting, they could meet in one or the other cathedral, or in some mutually agreed upon place; in subsequent votes they were to meet alternately in Atri and Penne.Ughelli, p. 1139. A document of 4 January 1252 mentions that among the dignities of the Chapter of Penne were the Primicerius and the Archpriest.Ughelli, p. 1143. Another, of 26 January 1260, names the Archdeacon, the Archpriest of civitas S. Angeli, the Archpriest of Monte Silvano, and two Primicerii; it also states that there were sixteen Canons of Penne. In 1698, the city of Penne had a population of c. 4000 persons, and its Cathedral Chapter was composed of three dignities and fourteen Canons.At the time the three dignities were: the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, and the Primicverius. Ughelli, p. 1111. The city of Atri had a population of c. 6000 persons, and its Cathedral Chapter was composed of four dignities and twenty Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 310 note 1. In 1755, there were three dignities and twelve Canons in Penne, and four dignities and sixteen Canons in Atri.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VI, p. 332 note 1. Bishop Tommaso Balbani (1599‚Äì1621) held a diocesan synod in 1599. Bishop Giuseppe Spinucci (1668‚Äì1695) held a diocesan synod in the cathedral of Penne in November 1681.

The AL is intended to take over some of the functionality of biological lungs. It is different from a heart-lung machine in that it is external and designed to take over the functions of the lungs for long periods of time rather than on a temporary basis. The heart-lung machine inspired the design of AL devices, however, modern ALs are optimised to minimize patient trauma. Following the development of the heart-lung machine, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), using a membrane oxygenator, was developed. This was intended to be used as a bridge to lung transplant (BTT), for patients too sick to wait until a donor lung was available. Mechanical Ventilation (MV) has also been used, however, it is damaging to the patient's lungs if used for extended periods of time. Both these therapies are expensive and are associated with poor quality of life, in part due to complex blood circuits required for these techniques to work. Recent developments include simplifying the ECMO system, and devices that use 380 micron wide hollow fibers to simulate the function of alveoli have been developed. Several research groups, notably, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Michigan, University of Maryland and Boston based groups are developing AL devices to bridge patients to lung transplant.

Among important mycoestrogens are zearalenone, zearalenol and zearalanol. Although all of these can be produced by various Fusarium species, zearalenol and zearalanol may also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested zearalenone. Alpha-zearalanol is also produced semisynthetically, for veterinary use; such use is prohibited in the European Union. Mechanism of action Mycoestrogens act as agonists of the estrogen receptors, ERŒ± and ERŒ≤.  Sources  Mycoestrogens are produced by various strains of fungi, many of which fall under the genus fusarium. Fusarium fungi are filamentous fungi that are found in the soil and are associated with plants and some crops, especially cereals. Zearalenone is mainly produced by F. graminearum and F. culmorum strains, which inhabit different areas depending on temperature and humidity. F. graminearum prefers to inhabit warmer and more humid locations such as Eastern Europe, Northern America, Eastern Australia, and Southern China in comparison to F. colmorum which is found in colder Western Europe.  Health effects  Mycoestrogens mimic natural estrogen in the body by acting as estrogen receptor (ER) ligands. Mycoestrogens have been identified as endocrine disruptors due to their high binding affinity for ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, exceeding that of well known antagonists such as bisphenol A and DDT. Studies have been performed that strongly suggest a relationship between detectable levels of mycoestrogen and growth and pubertal development. More than one study has shown that detectable levels of zearalenone and its metabolite alpha-zearalanol in girls are associated with significantly shorter heights at menarche. Other reports have documented premature onset of puberty in girls. Estrogen are known to cause decreased body weight in model animals, and the same effect has been seen in rats exposed to zearalenone. Interactions of ZEN and its metabolite with human androgen receptors (hAR) have also been documented.  Metabolism  Zearalenone has two major phase I metabolites: Œ±-zearalenol and Œ≤-zearalenol. When exposed orally ZEN is absorbed by the intestinal lining and metabolized there as well as in the liver. Research into the metabolism of ZEN has been difficult because of the significant difference in biotransformation between species making comparison challenging. = Phase I = The first transformation of metabolism of ZEN will reduce the ketone group to an alcohol via aliphatic hydroxylation and result in the formation of the two zearalenol metabolites. This process is catalyzed by 3 Œ±- and 3 Œ≤-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (HSD). CYP450 enzymes will then catalyze aromatic hydroxylation at the 13 or 15 position resulting in 13- or 15- catechols. Steric hindrance of at the 13 position is suspected to be the reason that in humans and rats there is more of the 15-catechol present. The catechols are the processed into mono-ethyl esters by catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). After this transformation they may be metabolized further to quinones which can cause the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause covalent modification of DNA. = Phase II = In phase-II metabolizing includes glucuronidation and sulfation of the mycoestrogen compound. Glucuronidation is the major phase II metabolic pathway. The transferase UGT (5'-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase) adds a glucuronic acid group sourced from uridine 5'-diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA). = Excretion = Mycoestrogens and their metabolites are largely excreted in urine in humans and in feces in other animal systems. In food Mycoestrogens are commonly found in stored grain. They can come from fungi growing on the grain as it grows, or after harvest during storage. Mycoestrogens can be found in silage. Some estimates state that 25% of global cereal production and 20% of global plant production may be at some point contaminated by mycotoxins of which mycoestrogens, especially those from fusarium strains, may make up a significant portion. Among mycoestrogens that contaminate plants are ZEN and its phase I metabolites. The limit for ZEN in unprocessed cereals, milling products, and cereal foodstuffs is 20-400 Œºg/kg (depending on the product in question).

The method is known by different names in different disciplines. In particular, it is similar to the velocity Verlet method, which is a variant of Verlet integration. Leapfrog integration is equivalent to updating positions x(t) and velocities v(t)=\\\\dot x(t) at interleaved time points, staggered in such a way that they \\"leapfrog\\" over each other. Leapfrog integration is a second-order method, in contrast to Euler integration, which is only first-order, yet requires the same number of function evaluations per step. Unlike Euler integration, it is stable for oscillatory motion, as long as the time-step \\\\Delta t is constant, and \\\\Delta t \\\\leq 2/\\\\omega.C. K. Birdsall and A. B. Langdon, Plasma Physics via Computer Simulations, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1985, p. 56. Using Yoshida coefficients, applying the leapfrog integrator multiple times with the correct timesteps, a much higher order integrator can be generated. Algorithm In leapfrog integration, the equations for updating position and velocity are :\\\\begin{align} a_i &= A(x_i), \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_{i+1/2} &= v_{i-1/2} + a_{i}\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{i+1} &= x_{i} + v_{i+1/2}\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\end{align} where x_i is position at step i, v_{i+1/2\\\\,} is the velocity, or first derivative of x, at step i+1/2\\\\,, a_{i}=A(x_i) is the acceleration, or second derivative of x, at step i, and \\\\Delta t is the size of each time step. These equations can be expressed in a form that gives velocity at integer steps as well:4.1 Two Ways to Write the Leapfrog :\\\\begin{align} x_{i+1} &= x_i + v_i\\\\, \\\\Delta t + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\,a_i\\\\, \\\\Delta t^{\\\\,2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_{i+1} &= v_i + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(a_i + a_{i+1})\\\\,\\\\Delta t. \\\\end{align} However, even in this synchronized form, the time-step \\\\Delta t must be constant to maintain stability.Skeel, R. D., \\"Variable Step Size Destabilizes the St√∂mer/Leapfrog/Verlet Method\\", BIT Numerical Mathematics, Vol. 33, 1993, p. 172‚Äì175. The synchronised form can be re-arranged to the 'kick-drift-kick' form; :\\\\begin{align} v_{i+1/2} &= v_i + a_i \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{i+1} &= x_i +v_{i+1/2}\\\\Delta t,\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_{i+1} &= v_{i+1/2} + a_{i+1} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}, \\\\end{align} which is primarily used where variable time-steps are required. The separation of the acceleration calculation onto the beginning and end of a step means that if time resolution is increased by a factor of two (\\\\Delta t \\\\rightarrow \\\\Delta t/2), then only one extra (computationally expensive) acceleration calculation is required. One use of this equation is in gravity simulations, since in that case the acceleration depends only on the positions of the gravitating masses (and not on their velocities), although higher-order integrators (such as Runge‚ÄìKutta methods) are more frequently used. There are two primary strengths to leapfrog integration when applied to mechanics problems. The first is the time-reversibility of the Leapfrog method. One can integrate forward n steps, and then reverse the direction of integration and integrate backwards n steps to arrive at the same starting position. The second strength is its symplectic nature, which implies that it conserves the (slightly modified) energy of dynamical systems. This is especially useful when computing orbital dynamics, as many other integration schemes, such as the (order-4) Runge‚ÄìKutta method, do not conserve energy and allow the system to drift substantially over time. Because of its time-reversibility, and because it is a symplectic integrator, leapfrog integration is also used in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a method for drawing random samples from a probability distribution whose overall normalization is unknown. Yoshida algorithms The leapfrog integrator can be converted into higher order integrators using techniques due to Haruo Yoshida. In this approach, the leapfrog is applied over a number of different timesteps. It turns out that when the correct timesteps are used in sequence, the errors cancel and far higher order integrators can be easily produced.http://www.artcompsci.org/kali/vol/two_body_problem_2/ch07.html#rdocsect46Volume 150, number 5,6,7 PHYSICS LETTERS A 12 November 1990 Construction of higher order symplectic integrators Haruo Yoshida National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Tokyo =4th order Yoshida integrator= One step under the 4th order Yoshida integrator requires four intermediary steps. The position and velocity are computed at different times. Only three (computationally expensive) acceleration calculations are required. The equations for the 4th order integrator to update position and velocity are :\\\\begin{align} x_i^1 &= x_i + c_1\\\\, v_i\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_i^1 &= v_i + d_1\\\\, a(x_i^1)\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_i^2 &= x_i^1 + c_2\\\\, v_i^1\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_i^2 &= v_i^1 + d_2\\\\, a(x_i^2)\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_i^3 &= x_i^2 + c_3\\\\, v_i^2\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_i^3 &= v_i^2 + d_3\\\\, a(x_i^3)\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{i+1} &\\\\equiv x_i^4 = x_i^3 + c_4\\\\, v_i^3\\\\, \\\\Delta t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_{i+1} &\\\\equiv v_i^4 = v_i^3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where x_i, v_i are the starting position and velocity, x_i^n, v_i^n are intermediary position and velocity at intermediary step n, a(x_i^n) is the acceleration at the position x_i^n, and x_{i+1},v_{i+1} are the final position and velocity under one 4th order Yoshida step. Coefficients (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4) and (d_1, d_2, d_3) are derived in (see the equation (4.6)) :\\\\begin{align} w_0 &\\\\equiv - \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt[3]{2}}{2-\\\\sqrt[3]{2}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_1 &\\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{2-\\\\sqrt[3]{2}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_1 &= c_4 \\\\equiv \\\\frac{w_1}{2}, c_2 = c_3 \\\\equiv \\\\frac{w_0+w_1}{2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_1 &= d_3 \\\\equiv w_1, d_2 \\\\equiv w_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} All intermediary steps form one \\\\Delta t step which implies that coefficients sum up to one: \\\\sum_{i=1}^{4}c_i=1 and \\\\sum_{i=1}^{3}d_i=1. Please note that position and velocity are computed at different times and some intermediary steps are backwards in time. To illustrate this, we give the numerical values of c_{n} coefficients: c_1=0.6756, c_2=-0.1756, c_3=-0.1756, c_4=0.6756.

He tried to beat up Colin Clay, a fellow supporter, and blame it on Manchester City fans to start a massive brawl between the two sides fans on derby day. Unfortunately, Colin accidentally died, forcing Sam to track Pete down and arrest him. =Phyllis Dobbs= WPC Phyllis Dobbs (Noreen Kershaw) is the station desk/custody officer, supervising the cells and mentoring WPC Annie Cartwright, with whom she forms a friendship. Phyllis is regarded by other characters as \\"one of the lads\\" and socialises with them in the pub after work which is the \\"male domain\\". In a time of social upheaval and women being treated as inferiors to men, Phyllis's no-nonsense attitude earns respect with the male fraternity because they know that, whatever rank they are, she won't tolerate their disrespect. She encourages Sam to act on his feelings toward Annie.Life on Mars episode 2.8 =Dicky Fingers= Richard \\"Dicky Fingers\\" Hands (Steve Evets) appeared in episode two of the second series and is introduced when Chris, Ray and Sam are sent to escort him from prison back to Manchester for questioning. During the transfer they are forced off of the road and held at gunpoint while the gunmen kidnap Dicky. It later transpires that the rescue was organised by corrupt police officer Harry Woolf. =Terry Haslam= Terry Haslam is a boxing manager who has a history with Gene Hunt. He beat up retired boxer Davie Mackie and blackmailed Hunt not to report it. However, Hunt did report it and took Haslam. Haslam was found innocent and Gene threatened to kill him. The next day Haslam is found dead and it is revealed that he had bet on Davie Mackie's last boxing match, telling Davie to throw the fight. Davie resisted, killing Haslam. =Leslie Johns= Leslie Johns (Sean Gilder) is a miner and an infamous cop killer. He organises the robbery of a train with a group of miners unaware Gene is undercover as one of the miners. The robbery seems to be going smoothly (Johns is unaware the train's staff are members of CID) but then Sam's radio goes off giving them up as police officers. When Annie, Chris, Ray and Gene run after Sam, Johns shoots Gene, Chris and Ray causing them to fall to the floor. When Sam returns from 2006 he shoots Johns dead as he is about to execute Gene. =Billy Kemble= Billy Kemble (Kevin Knapman) is arrested during episode seven for flashing his genitals in public and is investigated on suspected drug dealing. While in police custody, DS Ray Carling, assisted by DC Chris Skelton, force Kemble to eat cocaine, in the hope Kemble would reveal his supplier. Kemble has a heart attack, and dies in police custody. DCI Gene Hunt covers up the death to save all concerned from certain dismissal, but temporarily demotes Carling to Detective Constable, stating that the incident was \\"shameful\\" and that it was never to be repeated. =Derek Litton= Detective Chief Inspector Derek Litton, QPM (Lee Ross) is the Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) of the Regional Crime Squad. He and DCI Gene Hunt have a long- standing rivalry that festers into hatred of each other. The two departments fight after Gene and Detective Inspector Sam Tyler recover firearms stolen by factory workers, a job that falls under Litton's department. Later, in a hostage situation, Litton and Gene must work together to stop the hostages being killed. However, Litton's methods threaten Sam's and his own life, when Gene kicks him in the stomach and drops him out of the fire zone, proceeding to take a bullet which was blocked by one of his many hip flasks. Litton returns in Ashes to Ashes along with DI Geoffrey \\"Geoff\\" Bevan (Nicholas Gleaves), hunting comedian Frank Hardwicke (Roy Hudd) on suspicion of having robbed a police widows' benefit fund (in reality, Hardwicke had witnessed Bevan killing a young black man). Litton was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (distinguished service) some time in the intervening decade, flaunting it to Gene's detectives in Ashes to Ashes. =Frank Miller= Frank Miller (Peter Wight) appears in episode three of the second series as an owner of a local building site. It later transpires that he planted bombs around Manchester, thought to be placed by the Irish Republican Army, in order to distract the police while he broke into a bank. =Arnold Malone= Arnold Malone (Stephen Bent) is a longtime rival of Superintendent Harry Woolf. According to Woolf, Malone was responsible for a large amount of the crime rate in Manchester from the 1950s to the period of the show. Woolf tries to frame Malone for the robberies Woolf has been committing but the evidence leads DI Sam Tyler, DCI Gene Hunt, and DC Glenn Fletcher to arrest Woolf. =Nelson= Nelson (Tony Marshall) is the barman at the Railways Arms where most of CID go to drink. Nelson gives much advice to Sam during his time in 1973, typically with double-meanings that seem to apply to both an issue at hand in 1973, and to Sam's overarching problem of being trapped in a dystopic 1973. He usually affects a thick Jamaican accent, although Nelson is actually from Manchester (like Marshall), and uses the accent because his customers seem to like him better as a foreigner than as a black local. In the final year of the sequel series, Ashes to Ashes, Nelson's ghostly voice can be heard briefly in 1983 to DI Ray Carling, DC Chris Skelton and WPC Shaz Granger; Ray cannot quite place the voice, and Shaz never knew Nelson, but Chris recognises it and tells the other two. In the final act of the finale, after the characters have learned that they are dead souls in a CID purgatory, Nelson appears with a mystical version of the Railway Arms, suddenly in London. Still affecting the accent, he is an Odin or Saint Peter type figure who welcomes Ray, Chris, Shaz, and finally DI Alex Drake into a sort of policemen's Valhala or heaven: an eternal pub. Until the finale, Nelson's counterpart in Ashes to Ashes is Luigi, the proprietor of the eponymous trattoria across the street from the team's police station in the Fenchurch East district of London, and the landlord of Alex Drake who resides in a flat above. Unlike Nelson, Luigi really is an immigrant, and he does not appear to share Nelson's special insight. Nelson has two counterparts in the U.S. remake: a rarely seen bartender named Nelson (Mike Starr), and Sam's hippy (and possibly imaginary) neighbour, Windy (Tanya Fischer) who provides double-meaning insight to Sam. =Joni Newton= Joni Newton (Kelly Wenham) worked for local gangster Stephen Warren. She was a \\"honey trap\\" for Sam when he tried to go against Warren and take her into his care after purporting that she was going to be killed by him, where whilst she was in Sam's care she engaged in sex with him. She ended up going against Warren but was killed and her body was found on the canal. =Patrick O'Brien= Patrick O'Brien (Brendan Mackey) is an Irishman with a criminal record who was arrested by Gene for armed robbery. When dynamite goes missing at O'Brien's workplace he becomes the prime suspect in a spate of suspected IRA bombings. Gene is prejudiced against him because he is an ex-convict. This and his desire to avenge Ray cause Patrick to go on the run. Sam finds O'Brien and tells him he will find out who is really behind the bombs. =Frank Rathbone= Superintendent Frank Rathbone (William Hoyland) is the senior officer in overall command of both CID and uniform within the station. During episode 7 of the first series, DI Sam Tyler gives him a tape recording, proving that DS Ray Carling forced a prisoner to eat cocaine while in custody in the hope that it would get results out of him. Rathbone carelessly destroys the tape in front of Tyler without even bothering to hear its contents, satisfied that CID dealt with the matter internally and that there is no need for it to be taken further. Tyler feels let down by the corrupt Rathbone but accepts there is nothing else he can do. =Donald Sykes= Donald Sykes (Jack Deam) appears in episode eight of the second series, as a local criminal who is involved in a plot to rob a train with Leslie Johns. Sykes only gives up the plot after DCI Gene Hunt and DS Ray Carling savagely beat him up in the interrogation room. =Test Card Girl= The Test Card Girl (Rafaella Hutchinson in series one and Harriet Rogers in series two) is a young girl resembling the girl (Carole Hersee) in Test Card F, who appears as a vision to DI Sam Tyler. She often tells him things related to his current life, taunts Sam, and occasionally scares him greatly. For example, when he struggles with the stress of a failed bomb disposal, she appears to him showing her closed fists and chants \\"Red wire. Yellow wire. Red Wire. Yellow wire.\\" When he fails to pick the correct hand she calmly says: \\"You're dead Sam. They're all dead because of you.\\" At the end of the show, she runs down a street with other children and turns a switch, and the image disappears as in an old television set. In an interview with the Radio Times, Matthew Graham revealed the Test Card girl is constantly teasing and torturing Sam because she represents the devil in him. \\"But,\\" he said, \\"there is another factor to consider. In 1973, when television transmission ceased for the night, when the story is done and the characters have vanished into nothing, the BBC would switch to the Test Card girl. So she, if you want to be melodramatic, represents the apocalypse, the end.\\" She has two counterparts in the sequel programme, Ashes to Ashes. To the extent that she represents the devil and shuts off the Geneverse world, she foreshadows final series regular, DCI Jim Keats, a demon who obliterates the meticulously created Geneverse purgatory's fa√ßade, reveals the characters' prior deaths, and tempts them to come to hell. As a spectre who haunts the central protagonist, she and her clown doll, Bubbles, are akin to first series character the Clown Angel of Death who appears to terrorise DI Alex Drake and once frightens dying WPC Sharon Granger. She has no direct counterpart in the U.S. remake. =Vic Tyler= Victor \\"Vic\\" Tyler (Lee Ingleby) is the father of Sam Tyler. Sam becomes convinced if he gets his father to stay with his mother then he can get back to 2006. However, he finds his father is behind some brutal gangland killings. Adult Sam discovers to his horror the fleeting image he has throughout series 1, of a woman running in the woods in a red dress, is his memory of WPC Annie Cartwright chasing Vic at a family wedding and being brutally beaten by Vic. Adult Sam saves Annie from Vic but allows Vic to escape in order to protect his younger self from growing up the son of an imprisoned murderer. Vic has a counterpart in the first series of Ashes to Ashes: Tim Price (Andrew Clover), father of series protagonist Alex Drake. Like Sam, Alex is haunted throughout series 1 by fragments of a memory from her youth, which she re-lives in the series 1 finale when she and her younger self both watch Tim kill himself and Alex's mother, Caroline (Amelia Bullmore). His counterpart in the U.S. remake is Vic Tyler, portrayed by Dean Winters. =Stephen Warren= Stephen Warren (Tom Mannion) is a local gangster and owner of a nightclub, The Warren, who is paying the police, including Hunt, to turn a blind eye to his activities. He advises Sam Tyler not to go against him and infers that others have tried unsuccessfully; \\"others have tried to wear the white hat, and all have failed.\\" After he murders one of his staff who helped out Sam, Gene Hunt decides to turn his back on corruption, and he and Sam come into his club and arrest him for murder. His U.S. counterpart is Elliott Casso, portrayed by Robert Klein. =Harry Woolf= Detective Superintendent Harry Woolf (Kevin McNally) is the most senior officer at the station. He was also Gene Hunt's DCI when Gene Hunt was a DI and sees a lot of Gene in DI Sam Tyler, respecting Sam's policing methods. Woolf advises Gene to go by the book during the murder of George Rills in series 2, episode 1. Woolf is later revealed to be heavily corrupt, having masterminded a bank robbery to gain enough money to live out his last years before he dies of terminal cancer. Woolf planned to frame local gangster Arnold Malone for the robbery and had Dicky Fingers sprung from police escort for it. After Dicky reveals the truth about him to Tyler, Woolf releases him from his cell and has him executed. Despite Gene's loyalty to Woolf, he sees his corruption for what it is and attempts to arrest him. During the stand- off, Woolf is shot in the leg by Hunt and is subsequently held prisoner by an angry, betrayed DC Glenn Fletcher. Woolf loses everything, but Gene assures Sam that he won't let his old mentor die penniless and alone. One of Lt. Gene Hunt's sporadically seen superiors in the American version is Chief of Detectives Harry Woolf (Fred Thompson); unlike in the original, Chief Woolf is not shown to be corrupt. 2006 characters=Alex Drake= Detective Inspector Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Drake (n√©e Price) (unseen, subsequently portrayed by Keeley Hawes) is a police psychologist in London to whom DCI Sam Tyler posts debriefing tapes concerning his traumatic injury and the elaborate 1973 world he visited in his coma. She is mentioned near the end of the finale of Life on Mars and is properly introduced in the opening scene of Ashes to Ashes, becoming the central protagonist of the latter programme. =Maya Roy= Detective Constable Maya Roy (Archie Panjabi), born in early 1974 in Manchester to Englishwoman Leslie Roy (alias Layla Dylan) and the late Deepak Gandhi, an Ugandan Asian immigrant, is Sam's girlfriend in 2006. She is abducted by the suspect they are hunting at the beginning of the first episode; Sam is attempting to find her when he is struck by a car and transported back to 1973. She escapes unharmed whilst he is comatose in 2006 and trapped in 1973. Their relationship is already having difficulties before Sam's accident, and Maya ends it during the second series when it appears Sam will never recover. In the same episode, adult Sam meets Maya's pregnant mother Leslie, in 1973 and, in a predestination paradox, inspires her to name her baby Maya. Maya is, accordingly, approximately 4.5 years younger than Sam who is four in 1973. Her counterpart in the US remake is Detective Maya Daniels, portrayed by Lisa Bonet. 2006 and 1973 characters=Tony Crane= Tony Crane (Marc Warren) was arrested by Sam in 2006 for the murder of his wife Eve. He manages to get to Sam's hospital room and attempts to kill him, but is arrested before he can do so. In 1973, Crane runs a local casino and is Sam's prime suspect for the killing of a man on a bus. Gene doesn't believe Sam until Crane takes them both hostage. He is arrested after Annie uses a stinger (\\"invented\\" in 1973 by Sam, from his familiarity with them in the future) on his car in a chase, but there is not enough evidence to charge him. However, when Crane starts to make accusations of Sam's instability, citing the policeman's belief that he is a time traveller, Sam turns the tables by using this as proof of Crane's insanity. As a result, Crane is committed to a psychiatric hospital, where he remains for the next 33 years. His U.S. counterpart is Tony Crane, portrayed by Chris Bowers. Sam arrested him for murdering his wife, Penny Margolise, in 2008 and Sam quickly suspected him of murdering a news reporter who had visited his gallery in 1973. =Layla Dylan= See Leslie Roy =Glenn Fletcher= DC/Supt/DCC Glenn Fletcher (Ray Emmet Brown) appears in episode two of the second series as a Detective Constable in 1973 and, in momentary flashes forward, as a Deputy Chief Constable in 2006. He was one of the Manchester and Salford Police's first black recruits at the start of the 1970s.Front page obituary in 2006, shown in Life on Mars episode 2.2 at 07:30 In 1973, at only nineteen years of age,Front page obituary in 2006 gives his age as 52 years; 52-(2006-1973)=19. he is newly transferred to C Division CIDDCI Gene Hunt states that Fletcher is seconded from C Division in Life on Mars episode 2.2 at 09:17 as a detective constable. As the first black officer in the division, he experiences racist jokes and bullying from DS Ray Carling, to which Fletcher responds by agreeing with and making light of the racism. Sam encourages young DC Fletcher to assert himself and fight the racism which he's been tolerating. In the intervening years, Fletcher rises through the ranks in Hyde. He becomes Sam Tyler's superintendent and mentor, and is the senior officer who has Sam promoted to Detective Chief Inspector. His 2006 self is shown wearing the ribbons of both the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.Life on Mars episode 2.2 at 07:31, 09:41 The first black person to hold the rank of Deputy Chief Constable in the Greater Manchester Police, he dies suddenly of a heart attack at his Chorlton home in 2006 at the age of 52, while Sam is in a coma.2006 newspaper obituary, supra. The character is based on 1970s comic Charlie Williams. His counterpart in the U.S. remake is Detective/Captain Fletcher Bellow (Edi Gathegi). =Frank Morgan= DCI/Surgeon Frank Morgan (Ralph Brown) is a dual character, existing both in Sam's 2006 reality and his 1973 coma world. Sam first sees him, as yet unidentified, in a momentary flash in episode 2.5. His two selves are introduced in episode 2.7 and appear in episode 2.8. Sam is aware of both characters, and interprets the 1973 DCI Morgan to be an avatar of the 2006 surgeon Morgan. Many of DCI Morgan's statements to Sam are ambiguous, potentially referring to both Sam's 2006 medical condition and the 1973 police work. The duality of Morgan's character is reminiscent of the 1939 MGM production of The Wizard of Oz. Frank Morgan was the name of the actor who played both Professor Marvel and the Wizard in that production, and Life on Mars included frequent allusions to the film. Sam hears surgeon Frank Morgan explain that he is a specialist who has been called in to treat Sam's condition and bring him out of the coma; he tells Sam that the latter must fight to get back. DCI Morgan subsequently arrives from C Division, Hyde, taking acting command of A Division, Manchester, when DCI Gene Hunt is suspended during the proceedings resulting from Hunt being accused of murdering a man. Sam is impressed by DCI Morgan's modern, by-the-book, nature. Unlike Hunt and the others in 1973, Morgan records his interrogations. The manner in which he lays out his pens, notepad, inter alia, at the start of his interrogation of Gene echos Sam's actions in 2006 in episode 1.1. Morgan intends to remove Gene and modernise A Division. When Sam and Gene prove the latter's innocence, Morgan brings a bottle of liquor to CID's celebration and offers a \\"no hard feelings\\" truce which Gene accepts. In private, however, he tells Sam that bringing down Hunt will get Sam home (ostensibly back to Hyde; implicitly back to 2006). Morgan tells Sam that the latter is suffering amnesia from his injuries in ep. 1.1, is really named Sam Williams, and is undercover to expose the corruption of Gene Hunt and his team in \\"Operation MARS\\". Likening Sam's condition to a \\"waking coma\\" that Sam supposedly had after a coach crash in 1950 at the age of 12. Morgan shows Sam the cemetery where his (Williams') parents are buried, adjacent to the 19th-century graves of Vic, Ruth, and Sam Tyler. Sam tells Morgan about Gene's dangerous sting operation to catch train robbers in the act. Morgan instructs Sam to play along, ensuring him that a detachment of armed response officers will be in the railway tunnel to foil the robbery, protect Sam and his colleagues, and relieve Gene of duty permanently. When Sam runs into the tunnel during the robbery, however, Morgan informs him that there will be no armed response and he is cleaning house by letting Gene, DS Ray Carling, and DCs Chris Skelton and Annie Cartwright be killed. He leads Sam into oblivion, assuring him that he is going home. When Sam awakens in his 2006 hospital bed an instant later, he finds Mr Frank Morgan, surgeon, greeting him. Surgeon Morgan has operated on Sam to bring him out of his coma. Sam's hospital room is in Hyde Ward. In the US version, Frank Morgan is a FBI agent sent to the 125th Detective Squad to investigate an Irish gangster's murder and tries to frame Det. Sam Tyler, but Sam finds out that he murdered the gangster because he hijacked a truck of smuggled goods that Morgan had owned and is arrested by Lt. Gene Hunt. =Eve Olawi= Eve Olawi (Yasmin Bannerman) was killed by Tony Crane prior to Sam's coma. She dismisses his warnings in 1973 that she will have a terrible life with Crane. =Colin Raimes= Colin Raimes (Sam Hazeldine) is a suspected killer in 2006. Sam is convinced Colin was behind the 2006 crime but despite having written about killing in his diary, Raimes has a cast iron alibi. Maya suggests he might have known the killer. In 1973, Sam discovers that the true murderer in 2006 was Colin's neighbour, who was arrested in 1973 for a similar crime but released thirty years later. His American counterpart shares the same name. =Leslie Roy= Leslie Roy (Alex Reid) is the bookkeeper and girlfriend of Deepak Gandhi. She has recently fallen pregnant with his child when he is killed in the summer of 1973. She identifies herself by the alias Layla Dylan when first questioned by the police. Investigating the crime is DI Sam Tyler who, unlike their contemporaries, does not look down upon Leslie's relationship with an Ugandan Asian immigrant, as he had loved the daughter of one himself. With Deepak dead, Leslie intends to abort their child but is talked out of doing so by Sam who, in a predestination paradox, inspires her to name her baby Maya. In 2006 (unseen), Leslie does not particularly approve of her daughter's boyfriend and supervisor, DCI Sam Tyler. She would prefer that Maya would marry a physician or wealthy man rather than a police officer. =Ruth Tyler= Ruth Tyler (Joanne Froggatt in 1973 & Judi Jones in 2006) is the mother of Sam Tyler. Sam meets her whilst in 1973, incognito, improvising the name \\"Detective Inspector Bolan\\" when asked his name - he had spoken with musician Marc Bolan the previous evening. He meets her again when the CID deduces his father Vic might be involved with the Morton brothers. In \\"The Good Father\\", when the truth about Vic's involvement in violent crime is discovered, Ruth tells the four-year-old Sammy that Vic had to go away. Sam also speaks to Ruth when he returns to 2006, leaving Hunt and his team in 1973 in a mail train under fire from railway bandits. Without telling her the details, he says he promised someone he would return. She tells him she knows he won't let them down, because he always keeps his promises. This clears the way for his return to 1973. Ruth is not mentioned in Ashes to Ashes. In some respects, Caroline Price (Amelia Bullmore) is an analogous character. Series protagonist DI Alex Drake reunites with her mother, Caroline, and visits her childhood home, as Sam had done. Caroline provides Alex advice on occasion. Like Ruth, Caroline is unaware that she is married to a murderer. Her counterpart in the U.S. remake is Rose Tyler, portrayed by Jennifer Ferrin, and appears only in the 1973 world. The change of forename brought the Tyler surname full-circle. Series creator Matthew Graham's young daughter had given Sam the surname Tyler in homage to the companion on the newly re-launched Doctor Who, Rose Tyler.

The very long (251-amino acid residues) proregion of the cathepsin F precursor contains a C-terminal domain similar to the pro-segment of cathepsin L-like enzymes, a 50-residue flexible linker peptide, and an N-terminal domain predicted to adopt a cystatin-like fold.

The team finished just inside the relegation zone the following season, but avoided being sent down when the second team side of KFC Uerdingen, which had finished ahead of SV, folded due to the loss of the club's sponsor. After their retrieve, Straelen had a three-year stay at the Oberliga level that ended with a 17th-place finish in 2001.

GITR is currently of interest to immunologists as a co- stimulatory immune checkpoint molecule.  Function  TNFRSF18 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily. This receptor has been shown to have increased expression upon T-cell activation, and it is thought to play a key role in dominant immunological self-tolerance maintained by CD25+/CD4+ regulatory T cells. Knockout studies in mice also suggest the role of this receptor is in the regulation of CD3-driven T-cell activation and programmed cell death. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. = AITR = Human activation-inducible tumor necrosis factor receptor (AITR) and its ligand, AITRL, are important costimulatory molecules in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Despite the importance of these costimulatory molecules in autoimmune disease, their role in the autoimmune reaction to herniated disc fragments has yet to be explored. = GITR = GITR was identified as a new member of the TNF receptor superfamily, by comparing gene expression in untreated and DEX-treated murine T-cell lines. GITR can T cells are activated. Although mouse GITR is induced by either GC engagement or T-cell activation, its human homologue (hGITR/AITR) is upregulated only by activation. Therefore, the requirements for GR signaling in inducing GITR expression by T cells remain moot . GITR (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor) is a surface receptor molecule that has been shown to be involved in inhibiting the suppressive activity of T-regulatory cells and extending the survival of T-effector cells. In mouse models, GITR was initially noted to be selectively enriched on the surface of regulatory T cells, making this an attractive potential surface marker for these rare cells. However, subsequent studies revealed GITR to also be up-regulated on any activated T cells in humans, thus undermining its utility as a regulatory T cell marker.

Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that acts as a heterodimer, being composed of an invariant alpha subunit and a substrate-specific beta subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-specific SCS beta subunit that dimerizes with the SCS alpha subunit to form SCS-A, an essential component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. SCS-A hydrolyzes ATP to convert succinyl-CoA to succinate. Defects in this gene are a cause of myopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. A pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 6. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]  Structure  SCS, also known as succinyl CoA ligase (SUCL), is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic Œ± subunit encoded by the SUCLG1 gene and a Œ≤ subunit encoded by either the SUCLA2 gene or the SUCLG2 gene, which determines the enzyme specificity for either ADP or GDP. SUCLA2 is the SCS variant containing the SUCLA2-encoded Œ≤ subunit. Amino acid sequence alignment of the two Œ≤ subunit types reveals a homology of ~50% identity, with specific regions conserved throughout the sequences. SUCLA2 is located on chromosome 13 and contains 13 exons.  Function  As a subunit of SCS, SUCLA2 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate and acetoacetyl CoA, accompanied by the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, as a step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The ATP generated is then consumed in catabolic pathways. Since substrate-level phosphorylation does not require oxygen for ATP production, this reaction can rescue cells from cytosolic ATP depletion during ischemia. The reverse reaction generates succinyl-CoA from succinate to fuel ketone body and heme synthesis. While SCS is ubiquitously expressed, SUCLA2 is predominantly expressed in catabolic tissues reliant on ATP as their main energy source, including heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Within the brain, SUCLA2 is found exclusively in neurons; meanwhile, both SUCLA2 and SUCLG2 are absent in astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. In order to acquire succinate to continue the TCA cycle, these cells may instead synthesize succinate through GABA metabolism of Œ±-ketoglutarate or ketone body metabolism of succinyl-CoA.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the SUCLA2 gene are associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome. Symptoms include early onset low muscle tone, severe muscular atrophy, scoliosis, movement disorders such as dystonia and hyperkinesia, epilepsy, and growth retardation. Because succinic acid can not be made from succinyl coa, treatment is with oral succinic acid, which allows the krebs cycle, and electron transport chain to function correctly. Other treatments are managing symptoms and includes exercises to promote mobility, respiratory assistance, baclofen to treat dystonia and hyperkinesia, and antiepileptic drugs for seizures. There is a relatively high incidence of a specific SUCLA2 mutation in the Faroe Islands due to a founder effect. This particular mutation is often associated with early lethality. Two additional founder mutations in have been discovered in the Scandinavian population, in addition to the known SUCLA2 founder mutation in the Faroe Islands. These patients show a higher variability in outcomes with a number of patients with SUCLA2 missense mutation surviving into adulthood. This variability suggests that SUCLA2 missense mutations may be associated with residual enzyme activity. Coenzyme Q10 and antioxidants have been used to treat mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome but there is currently no evidence that these treatments result in clinical benefit. Mutations in the SUCLA2 gene leading to SUCLA2 deficiency result in Leigh's or a Leigh-like syndrome with onset of severe hypotonia, muscular atrophy, sensorineural hearing impairment, and often death in early childhood.

Biography After serving in the United States Armed Forces in World War II, Galanter attended Swarthmore College, receiving an Honors B.A. in 1950. He went on to graduate school in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and after receiving his Ph.D. in 1953, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematical Psychology in the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Psychology.History of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania Additionally, during several leaves in the 1950s, Galanter collaborated with S. S. Stevens at Harvard University's psychoacoustics laboratory, co-authoring several publications. While a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences of Stanford University Galanter began a collaboration with George A. Miller, and Karl H. Pribram, that resulted in the book Plans and the Structure of Behavior, a seminal work in the development of cognitive psychology published in 1960.Boden, Margaret A. Mind as Machine: A History of Cognitive Science. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. By 1956, Galanter had started working towards a theoretical model that would integrate cognitive processes into the behaviorist's stimulus-response framework.Galanter, E. and Gerstenhaber, M. (1956). On thought: the extrinsic theory. Psychological Review, 63, 218-27. In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller, Galanter, and Pribram proposed that \\"some mediating organization of experience is necessary\\" between the stimulus and its behavioral response, i.e., that a cognitive feedback loop, which includes monitoring devices, must control the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship. This feedback loop, the proposed fundamental unit of behavior, was referred to in Plans as the T.O.T.E., an abbreviation of its steps - test, operate, test, exit. Following the publication of Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Galanter, along with colleagues Robert Bush and Duncan Luce, worked to move the field of psychology closer to the other natural sciences by advancing the position of mathematical psychology within the discipline as a whole. Their argument was that all psychological phenomena, if properly measured and reduced to quantifiable variables, would reveal law-like rules that govern human behavior and thought. Together, Galanter, Bush, and Luce edited the three volume Handbook of Mathematical Psychology, which was published in 1963. After leaving the University of Pennsylvania, Galanter held positions at the University of Washington and Harvard University before becoming the Gelhorn Professor of Psychology at Columbia University, where he was also Director of the Psychophysics Laboratory and, for a time, Chairman of the Department of Psychology. In addition to his work in psychophysics and mathematical psychology, Galanter continues to publish in various subfields of psychometrics including psychoeducational assessment and motivational measurement. Galanter has been honored by NASA, which awarded him its Distinguished Scientist Research Award. After co-founding Children's Progress, Galanter went on to serve as Chief Scientific Officer.

Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP).

UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

RNF8 has activity both in immune system functions and in DNA repair.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene contains a RING finger motif and an FHA domain. This protein has been shown to interact with several class II ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), including UBE2E1/UBCH6, UBE2E2, and UBE2E3, and may act as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) in the ubiquitination of certain nuclear proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. RNF8 promotes repair of DNA damage through three DNA repair pathways: homologous recombinational repair (HRR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and nucleotide excision repair (NER). DNA damage is considered to be the primary cause of cancer, and deficiency in DNA repair can cause mutations leading to cancer. A deficiency in RNF8 predisposes mice to cancer. Chromatin remodeling After the occurrence of a double- strand break in DNA, the chromatin needs to be relaxed to allow DNA repair, either by HRR or by NHEJ. There are two pathways that result in chromatin relaxation, one initiated by PARP1 and one initiated by Œ≥H2AX (the phosphorylated form of the H2AX protein) (see Chromatin remodeling). Chromatin remodeling initiated by Œ≥H2AX depends on RNF8, as described below. The histone variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin. At the site of a DNA double-strand break, the extent of chromatin with phosphorylated Œ≥H2AX is about two million base pairs. Œ≥H2AX does not, by itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within seconds of irradiation the protein ‚ÄúMediator of the DNA damage checkpoint 1‚Äù (MDC1) specifically attaches to Œ≥H2AX. This is accompanied by simultaneous accumulation of RNF8 protein and the DNA repair protein NBS1 which bind to MDC1. RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation through its subsequent interaction with CHD4 protein, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex NuRD. RNF8 in Homologous Recombinational Repair DNA end resection is a pivotal step in HRR repair that produces 3‚Äô overhangs that provide a platform to recruit proteins involved in HRR repair. The MRN complex, consisting of Mre11, Rad50 and NBS1, carries out the initial steps of this end resection. RNF8 ubiquitinates NBS1 (both before and after DNA damage occurs), and this ubiquitination is required for effective homologous recombinational repair. Ubiquitination of NBS1 by RNF8 is, however, not required for the role of NBS1 in another DNA repair process, the error-prone microhomology-mediated end joining DNA repair. RNF8 appears to have other roles in HRR as well. RNF8, acting as a ubiquitin ligase, mono-ubiquitinates Œ≥H2AX to tether DNA repair molecules at DNA lesions. In particular, RNF8 activity is required to recruit BRCA1 for homologous recombination repair. RNF8 in Non-Homologous End Joining Ku protein is a dimeric protein complex, a heterodimer of two polypeptides, Ku70 and Ku80. Ku protein forms a ring structure. An early step in non-homologous end joining DNA repair of a double-strand break is the slipping of a Ku protein (with its ring protein structure) over each end of the broken DNA. The two Ku proteins, one on each broken end, bind to each other and form a bridge. This protects the DNA ends and forms a platform for further DNA repair enzymes to operate. After the broken ends are rejoined, the two Ku proteins still encircle the now intact DNA and can no longer slip off an end. The Ku proteins must be removed or they cause loss of cell viability. The removal of Ku protein is performed either by RNF8 ubiquitination of Ku80, allowing it to be released from the Ku protein ring, or else by NEDD8 promoted ubiquitination of Ku protein, causing its release from DNA. RNF8 in Nucleotide Excision Repair UV-induced formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA can lead to cell death unless the lesions are repaired. Most repair of these lesions is by nucleotide excision repair. After UV-irradiation, RNF8 is recruited to sites of UV-induced DNA damage and ubiquitinates chromatin component histone H2A. These responses provide partial protection against UV irradiation. Impaired spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis is the process in which spermatozoa are produced from spermatogonial stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis. A major function of meiosis is homologous recombinational repair of this germline DNA. RNF8 plays an essential role in signaling the presence of DNA double-strand breaks. Male mice with a gene knockout for RNF8 have impaired spermatogenesis, apparently due to a defect in homologous recombinational repair.  Interactions  RNF8 has been shown to interact with Retinoid X receptor alpha.

It is testis-specific in the fetus (aged 6 ‚Äì 11 weeks). In adults, it is expressed predominantly in the testis and adrenal glands, with some expression in the lungs, heart, kidneys and throughout the brain. FATE1 is member of the Miff protein family, with its C-terminal domain, consisting of a transmembrane domain with a coiled-coil domain, showing high similarity to the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) protein which is involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission.  Gene location  FATE1 gene in humans is located on the long arm of the X chromosome at region 28, from base pair 150,884,502 to base pair 150,891,617.  Mechanism  It has been hypothesized that FATE1 uses its C-terminal transmembrane domain to attach to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and with its C-terminal coiled-coil domain it interacts with mitochondria. FATE1 is localized in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) and modulates ER- mitochondria distance to regulate Ca2+\\\\- and drug dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. FATE1 expression leads to reduction of Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria and therefore decrease in fragmentation of mitochondria, associated with mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, consequently providing protection against cell death.  Relation to cancer  FATE1 is detectable in all cell lines derived from tumors, but is low or undetectable in telomere immortalized, non-tumorigenic fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells. FATE1 is suggested to be essential for survival of tumor cells as depletion of FATE1 results in viability reduction in melanoma, breast, prostate and sarcoma settings. Upregulation of FATE1 by a transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), involved in adrenal and gonadal development as well as in adrenocortical carcinoma, increases ER-mitochondria distance and is utilized by cancer cell to functionally uncouple ER and mitochondria. Silencing FATE1 gene sensitizes non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines to paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug against many different types of cancers. Elevated level of FATE1 is found to be associated with higher mortality rate in colorectal cancers, but in non-small-cell lung cancers, elevation of FATE1 alone did not decrease chance of survival, but decreased if RNF183 expression is also increased.

Moran, 509 U.S. 389 (1993), was a landmark decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if a defendant was competent to stand trial, they were automatically competent to plead guilty, and thereby waive the panoply of trial rights, including the right to counsel.. Circumstances On August 2, 1984, Richard Allen Moran entered the Red Pearl Saloon in Carson City, Nevada and shot the bartender and a customer before robbing the cash register. Nine days later he shot his ex-wife and then himself, and also unsuccessfully tried to slit his wrists. On August 13 Moran summoned the police to his hospital bedside and confessed to the killings. He was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, but pleaded not guilty. Two court- ordered psychiatrists concluded that he was competent to stand trial, although both noted he was depressed. The prosecution sought the death penalty. Two months after the psychiatric evaluations, Moran stated to the court that he wished to discharge his attorneys and change his plea to guilty. He also waived his right to counsel. After his trial he was sentenced to death. Moran then sought state post conviction relief on the grounds that he was mentally incompetent to represent himself. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing and then it rejected his claim. Appeals Moran's appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court was dismissed and a Federal District Court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. However, the Court of Appeals reversed this decision, concluding that due process required the trial court to hold a hearing to \\"evaluate and determine\\" Moran's competency before accepting his decisions to waive counsel and plead guilty. It also held that the trial court erred by using the wrong legal standard. It stated that competency to waive constitutional rights requires a higher level of mental functioning than the level of mental functioning required to stand trial. They reasoned that competence to stand trial requires only that the defendant have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and is capable of assisting his counsel, while competence to waive counsel or plead guilty requires that the defendant has the capacity for reasoned choice among those choices available. Moran petitioned the Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari. Decision In a split decision (7-2), the Court found that competency to stand trial and competency to plead guilty were equivalent competencies. In other words, if a person was found competent for one, the person was automatically competent for the second. Further, the court held that a person who is competent to stand trial is also competent to waive an attorney and proceed pro se. The court held that it was irrelevant if the individual represented himself inadequately. As Justice Kennedy stated in his concurring opinion: \\"At common law, therefore, no attempt was made to apply different competency standards to different stages of criminal proceedings or to the variety of decisions that a defendant must make during the course of those proceedings.\\"Godinez, 509 U.S. at 407 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Further, the Due Process Clause \\"does not mandate different standards of competency at various stages of or for different decisions made during the criminal proceedings.\\" Significance The court appears to be moving toward a single standard of competency to be applied throughout criminal proceedings. The court finds nothing in case law to the contrary. \\"[S]etting out varying competency standards for each decision and stage of a criminal proceeding would disrupt the orderly course of trial and, from the standpoint of all parties, prove unworkable both at trial and on appellate review.\\" As Justice Kennedy notes, this holding in Godinez v. Moran may seem harsh in equating all competencies as essentially equal. However, there are limitations noted in a careful reading of the decision. One is that the Court emphasized that competence to waive legal counsel alone does not make a waiver of counsel valid. The trial judge must determine if the waiver is \\"voluntary\\" and \\"intelligent\\". Further, in a decision, McKaskle v. Wiggins (1984), the Court held that even if the defendant successfully waives counsel, the court can provide a \\"standby counsel\\" if the pro se defendant has actual control over the presentation of the case to the jury, and the jury retains the belief the defendant is in charge of his own case. Implications for evaluation Following this decision, a forensic clinician conducting a competency evaluation for competency to stand trial, should also include an evaluation of competency to waive counsel. Subsequent developments Moran was executed by lethal injection on March 30, 1996.

Function  Aminoacylase-1 is a cytosolic, homodimeric, zinc-binding enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acylated L-amino acids to L-amino acids and acyl group, and has been postulated to function in the catabolism and salvage of acylated amino acids. ACY1 has been assigned to chromosome 3p21.1, a region reduced to homozygosity in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and its expression has been reported to be reduced or undetectable in SCLC cell lines and tumors. The amino acid sequence of human aminoacylase-1 is highly homologous to the porcine counterpart, and ACY1 is the first member of a new family of zinc- binding enzymes.

As an artist, he primarily works in the field of printmaking, with a particular focus on etching and serigraphy. His work also includes oil painting, drawing, glass art, photography and sculpture. Markus's painting titled \\"Pure Love\\" has been selected as one of the World's 10 most sensual paintings by Toronto Sun newspaper.Toronto Sun, August 20, 2013. Eternia, bronze sculpture Lady of Spring, etching Life and work Markus was born in 1953 in Budapest, Hungary.Art Business News, March 2001. His mother is Sz≈ëll≈ës Erzs√©bet and father K√°roly M√°rkus. His childhood in Hungary, where he frequented museums, is an influence on his work. He is also influenced by avant-garde art and abstraction. Markus began his career as a sculptor. At the age of fourteen, he and his work were featured on international public television. He became increasingly frustrated with teachers and the confines of communism, realizing his Renaissance-inspired emphasis on the individual conflicted with Hungarian communist beliefs. In 1978, Markus immigrated to America. Once there, he established a studio in California. He began to work with traditional printmaking, including etching, around 1979. He often uses two or three copper plates when creating his etchings, and up to 100 colors when printing his serigraphs. He mixes drypoint, aquatint and soft-ground etching techniques with graphite pencil. Csaba Markus is closely associated with the sfumato technique. His oil painting begins with a grisaille in a gray or sepia, as a monochromatic version of the finished piece. When this is dry, Markus begins to add layers of glaze in different colors, letting each layer dry before adding the next one. Since the layers are all somewhat transparent, the result is a combination of the colors, creating a final hue as if the painter has simply mixed the colors. He paints using very thin and transparent layers of paint, using as many as 30 layers around the eyes and mouth.

The Carolina Panthers were reportedly very interested in him, evident by them sending head coach John Fox and General Manager Marty Hurney to his pro-day. =Carolina Panthers= Reports of the Panthers being interested in Otah proved to be well founded after the team made a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles to trade up and to select him. He was selected with the 19th pick in the first round. Jeff became an immediate starter at right tackle early in training camp. He started in 12 of the possible 16 games his first season missing 4 due to injury. Otah started the 2010 season recovering from what was then thought to be relatively minor knee surgery performed in mid-August. But on 9 November, the Panthers placed Otah on injured reserve, ending his season without him ever taking the field. Otah's knee problems persisted into the 2011 season, and he was placed on injured reserve again on 19 October 2011, after missing two of six games. Otah was traded to the New York Jets for an undisclosed draft pick on July 23, 2012 contingent on his passing a physical for the team. After failing the initial test, the Jets placed Otah on the PUP/Active list on July 25. He had seven days to pass the test again or the trade would be nullified. On July 31, Otah failed his second physical thus voiding the trade and returning him to the Panthers. Otah was released by the Panthers two days later.

The protein encoded by this gene is similar to oxidoreductases, which are enzymes involved in cellular responses to oxidative stresses and irradiation. This gene is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and is thought to be involved in p53-mediated cell death. It contains a p53 consensus binding site in its promoter region and a downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence. P53 has been shown to transcriptionally activate this gene by interacting with the downstream pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence. The microsatellite is polymorphic, with a varying number of pentanucleotide repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional activation by p53. It has been suggested that the microsatellite polymorphism may be associated with differential susceptibility to cancer.

Rated only a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was not ranked among the nation's top offensive tackle prospects. College career Clady attended Boise State University, where he played for the Boise State Broncos football team from 2004 to 2007. He redshirted as a freshman in 2004. He earned the starting right tackle position at the beginning of the 2005 season and started 13 of 13 games. He was voted to several dotcoms' second and third team All-American squads. He was moved to the left side before the 2006 campaign, starting all 13 games. Clady earned first-team All-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) honors following his sophomore season and was also named to the prestigious SI.com Second-team All- American squad. In 2007, he started each game he played for Boise State and was once again a First-team All-WAC selection. Clady also made several First- team All-American rosters. Clady was part of Boise State's historic 43‚Äì42 overtime win over Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. In that game, many scouts first were able to see Clady on a national stage and marveled at how well Clady handled Oklahoma pass rushers..

Through his first 20 games, he surrendered only half of a sack. Clady was named a starter for the 2009 Pro Bowl and was named first-team All-Pro by the Sporting News and Associated Press after the 2009 season. On April 28, 2010, Clady injured his patella tendon while playing basketball but did not miss a game the following season. In 2011, Clady played all 16 games and was added to the 2012 Pro Bowl roster along with teammate Willis McGahee. After the season, the Broncos tried to sign Clady to a long-term deal and offered him a 5-year $50 million deal with $28 million guaranteed, but he refused. In the 2012 season, Clady allowed just one sack the entire season. Towards the end of the season, he tore a labrum in his right shoulder but still did not miss any time.

The term has come to describe a constitutional arrangement in which instead of receiving a block grant from the UK Exchequer as at present, the Scottish Parliament would receive all taxation levied in Scotland; it would be responsible for most spending in Scotland but make payments to the UK government to cover Scotland's share of the cost of providing certain UK-wide services, including at least defence and the conduct of foreign relations. Scottish fiscal autonomy ‚Äì stopping short of full political independence ‚Äì is usually promoted by advocates of a federal or confederal constitution for the United Kingdom. It was once proposed that a greater % of those who support further moves towards Scottish independence support a move to greater fiscal autonomy while a greater percentage of those who wish to retain the Union between Scotland and the rest of the UK would be opposed. However, as the debate unfolds a move towards FFA could be considered as a compromise by advocates of both sides. As early as July 2001, former Conservative Party chancellor Kenneth Clarke said he believed that it would be \\"disastrous for the Scottish economy\\".Clarke warns on Scots freedom On the other hand, Robert Crawford, the former head of Scottish Enterprise, said in February 2004 that the Scottish economy \\"could be improved\\" by fiscal autonomy.Crawford backs fiscal autonomy David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party, stated in 2005 that he would not stand in the way of handing full taxation powers to the Scottish Parliament if the idea was supported by the Scottish Conservative Party. The 2011 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey core finding was that while 32% of respondents supported Scottish independence, 43% supported greater autonomy within the UK. 29% of respondents supported devo-max, but only 21% supported the status quo. Since the 2011 election of a SNP majority government The election of a majority Scottish National Party government in May 2011, committed to holding an independence referendum, also brought the possibility that FFA could be an extra option in the vote.Scotland independence vote could contain 'financial autonomy' option www.guardian.co.uk, 8 May 2011 Some senior Scottish Labour Party figures have also suggested that they would support devo max, including Malcolm Chisholm MSP,Malcolm Chisholm: Labour must support Devo-Max and abandon Calman newsnetscotland.com, accessed 23 October 2011 Mark Lazarowicz MP,Salmond gives backing to ‚Äòdevo max‚Äô ballot choice www.scotsman.com, 23 October 2011 and former First Minister Henry McLeish. The \\"devo-max\\" option was not included in the 2014 independence referendum, however, as the Edinburgh Agreement stipulated that the referendum had to be a clear binary choice between independence or the existing devolution arrangements. A public opinion poll carried out at the end of October 2011 for the BBC Politics Show indicated that devo-max was the most popular option with Scottish voters: 33% backed devo-max, 28% supported independence and 29% backed no further constitutional change. A public opinion poll carried out in March 2013 for the SNP, however, indicated that 52% of respondents believed the Scottish Government should be responsible for all tax and spending decisions in Scotland. Also, 53% of respondents believed that the Scottish government would be best suited to decide welfare and pensions policy for Scotland. Economic effects of full fiscal autonomy The economic effects of full fiscal autonomy have been the subject of debate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies published a report in March 2015 that calculated that for the year 2015‚Äì16 there would be a gap of ¬£7.6 billion in Scotland's budget under FFA, in comparison with the current system for distributing spending. This analysis has been criticised by the SNP's deputy leader, Stewart Hosie, on the basis that it represents figures for only one year and that it overlooks the extra growth the SNP says it can generate with more powers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies responded to some of these criticisms in a later report. It argued: \\"Delaying a move to full responsibility for a few years would not on its own deal with the fiscal gap.... Indeed, if anything, given current spending and revenue forecasts, the gap would likely grow rather than shrink over the next few years. It would remain the case that full fiscal responsibility would likely entail substantial spending cuts or tax rises in Scotland. While a big and sustained rebound in oil revenues or significantly higher growth in Scotland could mitigate this, there can be no presumption that either would occur. \\"There are a number of aspects of fiscal autonomy which are unclear; the level of payments to the UK government (for debt interest and Trident renewal), the ability of the oil sector to redeploy into other areas filling the productivity gap, and whether economic growth in Scotland is better supported by an Edinburgh or London government\\".

Football Ted Rippon was recruited by Carlton from Cheltenham, however a series of injuries prevented him from breaking into Carlton Seniors. He moved to Essendon in 1933, and made his senior debut against St Kilda on 22 July 1933 (round 13 of the home-and-away season). He was a good, hard working, reliable player for Essendon, winning Essendon's Most Serviceable Player award in 1935, who played the most of his 69 senior games in the ruck. He was often referred to as \\"Autumn Leaves\\" because of his propensity to fall over after contesting the ball in the air (Carlton's John Benetti (1958‚Äì1965) was also known as \\"Autumn Leaves Benetti\\" for a similar reason). He played a number of games for the Carlton Second XVIII in 1939 and 1941, but never played with the First XVIII.Edward Rippon, Blueseum.

The July 1928 sixth congress of the Communist International declared that 'The Union of all communist groups and individuals scattered throughout the country into a single, illegal, independent and centralized party represent the first task for Indian communists.' This was a statement made in opposition to the building of the 'multi-class' WPP. The new line was promoted at the congress by the Finnish communist Otto Kuusinen. In his report, he stated that it was 'necessary to reject the formation of any kind of bloc between the Communist Party and the national-reformist opposition' in the colonies. Moreover, he claimed that parties like WPP could develop into petty bourgeois parties. Leon Trotsky concurred with this view. In June 1928, he had submitted a document which called WPP an invention of Joseph Stalin and that the party was a 'thoroughly anti-Marxist formation'.Kumar - Stage of the Indian Revolution Abani Mukherji, a founding member of CPI, had described WPP as a 'Kuomintang Party' and that WPP 'is accumulating by itself the elements of future Indian Fascism.'.CHNN, No 13, Autumn 2002: Features S.N.

The letter did however take long time to reach the WPP. The Tenth Plenum of the ECCI, 3 July ‚Äì 19 July 1929, directed the Indian communists to break with WPP.

Policies The founding manifesto of the Labour Swaraj Party stressed that the party was organised on the basis of class struggle, for the liberation of the masses. The party combined demand for full independence with socio-economic demands. In 1927, the WPP of Bombay presented a programme of action to the All India Congress Committee. The programme proposed struggle for full independence combined with active socio-economic policies for the toiling classes. The WPP of Bengal had submitted a manifesto the Madras Congress session, which sought that the Congress should engage in mass struggles for full independence and that a Constituent Assembly should determine the constitution of an independent India.Ralhan, O.P.

The TAG deals with coexistence between unlicensed wireless networks. Many of the IEEE 802 wireless standards use unlicensed spectrum and hence need to address the issue of coexistence. These unlicensed wireless devices may operate in the same unlicensed frequency band in the same location. This can lead to interference between these two wireless networks.  Background  Two unlicensed wireless networks are said to coexist if they can operate in the same location without causing significant interference to one another. One of the first examples of wireless coexistence was between IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth, both operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band. Coexistence between these two wireless networks was addressed by the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 2,IEEE 802.15.2 which produced a Recommended Practice on Coexistence of IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth.  Overview  Currently the 802.19 TAG addresses coexistence between wireless standards under development within IEEE 802. There are a number of working groups within IEEE 802 which are developing standards for unlicensed wireless network. These include * IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) * IEEE 802.15 Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) * IEEE 802.16 Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) * IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN) When a new standard (or amendment to a standard) for an unlicensed wireless network is being developed the working group may develop a Coexistence Assurance (CA) document that is reviewed the IEEE 802.19 TAG. The TAG is currently evaluating the coexistence between IEEE 802.11y and IEEE 802.16h, both operating in the 3650 MHz frequency band.

The road is a minimum of four lanes for its entire length, and is among Windsor's busiest, with an Average Annual Daily Traffic amount of 35,000 vehicles per day from Eugenie Street to Cabana Road.  History  The road was part of the original alignment of Highway 3 from 1917 to 1929, when Highway 3 was re-aligned onto the newly built Huron Church Road to serve the also newly constructed Ambassador Bridge. Dougall Avenue then became Highway 3A. In 1935, the provincial highway was re- labelled as Highway 3B. In 1962, Ouellette Avenue was re-aligned south of Eugenie Street to allow better direct access to and from Dougall Avenue, and to eliminate a short 3-block \\"jog\\" east along Tecumseh Road near downtown. Highway 3B was re-aligned onto Ouelette Place (the \\"curve\\" along Ouellette Avenue) and Ouellette Avenue, terminating in Downtown Windsor. This curve was finished and opened in 1963. In 1966, the road was also designated as a connecting link. This meant that while Windsor would have more responsibility in maintaining and repairing the road, the Ministry of Transportation would still contribute and help. The road's status as a provincial highway was repealed in 1975, but the connecting link agreement was kept, allowing the road to still be signed as Highway 3B, to reduce confusion among motorists. The connecting link was ultimately repealed in 1998.  Route Description = Dougall Parkway to Ouellette Place = The road officially begins at the interchange with Howard Avenue, with a small former alignment in place to serve several homes, named \\"Dougall Place\\". The road narrows from a four-lane dual carriageway (speed limit of 80 km/h or 50 mph) to a four-lane undivided urban arterial road, with a speed limit of 60 km/h (40 mph). The roadway is heavily built-up on all sides, with mostly shopping plazas and businesses, but with houses as well. The largest of plaza is the South Windsor Walmart (located south of E. C. Row Expressway). North of the Walmart and interchange with E.C. Row Expressway, the road becomes a narrowly divided four-lane arterial road, passing under 1 railway overpass, as well as passing next to the Zalev Brothers' Scrap Yard. It is here, that Dougall Road continues north, but all lanes default onto Ouellette Place. = Intersection with Ouelette Place = The intersection of Ouellette Place is very dangerous (among the most dangerous in the entire city), as the shape and angle of the intersection (and the reduced visibility from 1 active and 2 removed railroad overpasses) draws the attention of motorists behind them when trying to continue straight (by making a left-turn) on Dougall Avenue, or to make a left-turn onto Ouellette Place northbound from Dougall Avenue southbound. The road was designed to keep the majority of traffic onto Ouellette Avenue, and this has been the cause of many accidents, such as rear-end collisions. There have been petitions now and then for Windsor City Council to fix the intersection or close off access to Dougall Avenue entirely (and have signs directing motorists that want to access Dougall Avenue to use Eugenie Street). = North of Ouellette Place = North of Ouellette Place, the road is far quieter, though still has a fair amount of traffic around Dorwin Plaza, Superstore and the Cogeco Cable offices. Most of the traffic on this street uses Eugenie Street to get to and from Ouellette Place, and to serve the businesses along it. After crossing the CP Rail and Essex Terminal Railway tracks, the road becomes a two-lane residential collector road with on-street parking, with two-way access terminating at the intersection of Tecumseh Road. North of this street, the road is southbound-only, and is entirely residential in nature, with very low traffic volumes.  Truck Traffic Issues  In recent months, the Windsor Star has reported that heavy international transport truck traffic on the road has tripled (not counting those trucks making deliveries to stores and locations along the road) since trucks were banned by a 2003 city bylaw from using Wyandotte Street as a \\"short cut\\" to the Ambassador Bridge in an attempt to avoid the very-busy Huron Church Road. Councillor Drew Dilkens has requested for the bylaw to be extended to include Dougall Avenue between Highway 401 (including Dougall Parkway) and E. C. Row Expressway (with exceptions for trucks making local deliveries), citing studies done that show nearly all the trucks on the road use Dougall Avenue to approach E. C. Row Expressway, then to Huron Church Road (public opinion has traditionally been strong on keeping international truck traffic off of E.C. Row) as it already handles a large number of commuter traffic and is the fastest way to cross the city.Thursday, January 3, 2007 issue of the Windsor Star  References  Category:Streets in Windsor, Ontario ","title":"Dougall Avenue"},{"id":"15067074","text":"Comparettia, abbreviated Comp in the horticultural trade,http://www.rhs.org.uk/RHSWebsite/files/87/87be8b1e-908e-4e04-9ee6-30c438354458.pdf is a genus of orchids.

It also serves as a counterexample to the claim that all Cantor spaces are ambiently homeomorphic to each other. It was discovered by . Construction Antoine's necklace is constructed iteratively like so: Begin with a solid torus A0 (iteration 0). Next, construct a \\"necklace\\" of smaller, linked tori that lie inside A0. This necklace is A1 (iteration 1). Each torus composing A1 can be replaced with another smaller necklace as was done for A0. Doing this yields A2 (iteration 2). This process can be repeated a countably infinite number of times to create an An for all n. Antoine's necklace A is defined as the intersection of all the iterations. Properties Since the solid tori are chosen to become arbitrarily small as the iteration number increases, the connected components of A must be single points. It is then easy to verify that A is closed, dense-in-itself, and totally disconnected, having the cardinality of the continuum. This is sufficient to conclude that as an abstract metric space A is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. However, as a subset of Euclidean space A is not ambiently homeomorphic to the standard Cantor set C, embedded in R3 on a line segment. That is, there is no bi- continuous map from R3 ‚Üí R3 that carries C onto A. To show this, suppose there was such a map h : R3 ‚Üí R3, and consider a loop k that is interlocked with the necklace. k cannot be continuously shrunk to a point without touching A because two loops cannot be continuously unlinked. Now consider any loop j disjoint from C. j can be shrunk to a point without touching C because we can simply move it through the gap intervals. However, the loop g = h‚àí1(k) is a loop that cannot be shrunk to a point without touching C, which contradicts the previous statement. Therefore, h cannot exist. In fact, there is no homeomorphism of R3 sending A to a set of Hausdorff dimension < 1, since the complement of such a set must be simply-connected.

It has also been referred to as, but should not be confused with, cyclophilin D (CypD), which is encoded by the PPID gene. As a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family, this protein catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, which allows it to facilitate folding or repair of proteins. PPIF is a major component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and, thus, highly involved in mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis, as well as in mitochondrial diseases and related conditions, including cardiac diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and muscular dystrophy. In addition, PPIF participates in inflammation, as well as in ischemic reperfusion injury, AIDS, and cancer.  Structure  Like other cyclophilins, PPIF forms a Œ≤-barrel structure with a hydrophobic core. This Œ≤-barrel is composed of eight anti-parallel Œ≤-strands and capped by two Œ±-helices at the top and bottom. In addition, the Œ≤-turns and loops in the strands contribute to the flexibility of the barrel. PPIF weighs 17.5 kDa and forms part of the MPTP in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM).  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family. PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins. Generally, PPIases are found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, as well as in a few archaebacteria, and thus are highly conserved. The PPIase family is further divided into three structurally distinct subfamilies: cyclophilin (CyP), FK506-binding protein (FKBP), and parvulin (Pvn). As a cyclophilin, PPI binds cyclosporin A (CsA) and can be found within in the cell or secreted by the cell. In eukaryotes, cyclophilins localize ubiquitously to many cell and tissue types, though studies on PPIF focus primarily on heart, liver, and brain tissue. In addition to PPIase and protein chaperone activities, cyclophilins also function in mitochondrial metabolism, apoptosis, immunological response, inflammation, and cell growth and proliferation. PPIF is especially involved in mitochondrial apoptosis as a major component of the MPTP. Through its PPIase ability, the protein interacts with and induces a conformational change in adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), the other MPTP component. This activation, along with high calcium ion levels, induces the opening the MPTP, resulting in mitochondrial swelling, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, membrane depolarization, failing ATP production, caspase cascade activation, and ultimately, apoptosis.  Clinical significance  As a cyclophilin, PPIF binds the immunosuppressive drug CsA to form a CsA-cyclophilin complex, which then targets calcineurin to inhibit the signaling pathway for T-cell activation. Due to its association with the MPTP, PPIF is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. For neurodegenerative diseases, treatment of reperfusion events with CsA, a PPID inhibitor, prevents cytochrome C release and significantly reduces cell death in neurons. As such, PPID proves to be an effective therapeutic target for patients suffering neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, PPIF, as part of the MPTP, is involved in ischemia/reperfusion injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI), muscular dystrophy, and drug toxicity. Though PPIF was identified as a candidate for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) for one afflicted family, further study revealed no mutations in the gene to implicate it in the disease. Nonetheless, in cardiac myogenic cells, cyclophilins have been observed to be activated by heat shock and hypoxia-reoxygenation as well as complex with heat shock proteins. Thus, cyclophilins may function in cardioprotection during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Currently, cyclophilin expression is highly correlated with cancer pathogenesis, but the specific mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

Function  RAS guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RASGRP) is a member of a family of genes characterized by the presence of a Ras superfamily guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain. It functions as a diacylglycerol (DAG)-regulated nucleotide exchange factor specifically activating Ras through the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. It activates the Erk/MAP kinase cascade and regulates T-cells and B-cells development, homeostasis and differentiation.  Gene  Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. The corresponding rat gene rbc7, which lacks a 5-prime exon, represents a 5-prime and 3-prime truncated version of a larger normal rat transcript that encodes a predicted 90-kD protein. This shorter transcript has not been found in humans.  Clinical significance  In November 2016 a 12-year-old patient was hospitalized for repetitive infections. Scientists have assumed that a genetic problem might be the reason. More specifically, the genetic cause is a defect of the RASGRP1 gene which makes it inactive. . RASGRP1 plays a role in the functions of natural killer cell dyneins. Since dyneins are motor proteins, their function is to circulate the elements inside the cells.

He studied at the lycee in Nancy. His father was a director of a manufacturer of matchsticks. After this, he studied at the Coll√®ge de Compi√®gne. He was awarded the bacculareat in Latin and science in 1905 and the bacculareat in mathematics in 1906. He then attended √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Once he graduated, he became a mathematics teacher the Lyc√©e de Dijon in Saint-Cyr. He married his wife, Marguerite Rouselle in 1918. After the declaration of World War I, Antoine served as a reserve lieutenant in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of Amiens, and later a commander on the machine gun of the 151st Infantry Regiment. In 1917, he lost his sight as a result of bullets hitting his eyes. After the loss of his vision, Henri Lebesgue suggested that Antoine study two- and three-dimensional topology as it could be studied without the use of his sight. Work In 1919, Antoine began his doctorate in mathematics at the University of Strasbourg. Antoine was assisted by his friends during his studies, who produced braille copies of mathematical papers.

Description The PUT strategy is designed to sell a sequence of one-month, at-the-money, S&P; 500 Index puts and invest cash at one- and three-month Treasury Bill rates. The number of puts sold varies from month to month, but is limited so that the amount held in Treasury Bills can finance the maximum possible loss from final settlement of the SPX puts. The PUT Index was introduced in 2007 by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The Index is calculated and disseminated daily by the CBOE and the daily price history of the PUT Index dates back to June 30, 1986. Award for Innovation The CBOE S&P; 500 PutWrite Index (PUT) won the annual award for the Most Innovative Benchmark Index at the Twelfth Annual Super Bowl of Indexing Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on December 3, 2007. The 2007 award for the PUT Index was one of only three product awards granted as part of the William F. Sharpe Indexing Achievement Awards. Study by Ennis Knupp + Associates On January 5, 2009, the consulting firm of Ennis Knupp + Associates issued a press release that introduced a new six-page study on the performance of five benchmark indexes for the period from July 1986 through October 2008 - the PUT Index, the S&P; 500 Index, the MSCI EAFE Index, the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index and 3-Month Treasury Bills. Among the key findings of the study were the following: 1\\\\. Annualized Returns. The PUT Index had annualized returns of 10.32% during the period analyzed, higher than the other four indexes studied. (The annualized returns were 8.77% for the S&P; 500, 7.16% for the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, 6.11% for MSCI EAFE Index, and 4.09% for 3-Month Treasury Bills.) 2\\\\. Volatility. The PUT Index had an annualized standard deviation of returns of 9.91%, which was 36% less than the 15.39% standard deviation for the S&P; 500\\\\. (Other annualized standard deviations were 17.39% for MSCI EAFE Index, 4.05% for the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, and 0.53% for 3-Month Treasury Bills.) 3\\\\. Relative Performance. The PUT Index has tended to outperform the S&P; 500 in quiet and falling markets, and underperform the S&P; 500 in months when stock prices rise sharply. In the months in which the S&P; 500 experienced large positive returns, the average monthly returns were 4.14% for the S&P; 500 and 2.11% for the PUT Index. In the months in which the S&P; 500 experienced large negative returns, the average monthly returns were negative 5.38% for the S&P; 500 and negative 2.93% for the PUT Index. 4\\\\. High Gross Monthly Premiums and Sources of Return. On average, selling the at-the-money put option each month earned a premium of 1.65% of the notional value of the index, which averaged 19.8% per year. The income return of 19.8% exceeds the total return of 10.3%, as a portion of premiums are paid to insure losses of the put buyers. The PUT Index had a higher Sharpe ratio, higher Sortino Ratio, and more negative skewness than the S&P; 500 Index. A key source of excess returns for the PUT Index lies in the fact that index options have tended to trade at prices above their fair value, and so some sellers of short-term index options have been able to generate excess risk-adjusted returns. Annual income from the sale of put options is higher from the sale of 1-month options than the sale of longer maturity options. 5\\\\. Investing in the Index. The first licensed fund designed to track the PUT Index was launched in April 2007, and the fund and the PUT Index had a very similar risk-return tradeoff, experiencing a correlation of 0.99 since inception.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This protein localizes to the cytoplasm and its expression is induced by interferon. TRIM22 is also a target gene of the tumor suppressor protein p53. TRIM22 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and is able to ubiquitinate itself with the assistance of the E2 enzyme UbcH5B. Furthermore, TRIM22 is located in the nucleus and therefore may function as a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase.  Clinical significance  The protein down- regulates transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter region, suggesting that function of this protein may be to mediate interferon's antiviral effects. Other proteins that function to restrict HIV replication include TRIM5alpha and APOBEC3G. It has been demonstrated that treatment of cells with interferon type I inhibits HIV replication and TRIM22 is strongly up-regulated by interferon treatment. Furthermore, HIV particle release from cells depleted of TRIM22 with RNA interference is enhanced. TRIM22 appears to prevent the movement of the HIV Gag protein to the plasma membrane and hence TRIM22 can block HIV replication in cell cultures by preventing the assembly of the virus.

It is one of only two books she wrote and had published under both of her married names of \\"Christie\\" and \\"Mallowan\\" (the other being Star Over Bethlehem and other stories) and was first published in the UK in November 1946 by William Collins and Sons and in the same year in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company. The UK edition retailed for ten shillings and sixpence (10/6) and the US edition at $3.00. Title The book's title, a quote from verse three of the White Knight's poem, Haddocks' Eyes from chapter eight of Through the Looking-Glass (1871) by Lewis Carroll, is also word play on the word \\"Tell\\", used to describe an archaeological mound or site. Background Christie first thought of writing the book in 1938 and wrote to her literary agent, Edmund Cork, in July of that year, suggesting the project and telling him that it would be \\"not at all serious or archaeological\\".Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (p. 216) Collins, 1984 In the event, she wrote the book during the Second World WarChristie, Agatha. An Autobiography. (p. 466). Collins, 1977. after her husband, Max Mallowan, had been posted to Egypt with the British Council in February 1942Morgan. (p. 235). and she was living alone in London. She occupied her hours by working in a hospital dispensary, using the knowledge she had gained doing the same job in the First World War working two full days, three half- days and alternate Saturday mornings and, \\"The rest of the time, I wrote.\\"Christie. An Autobiography. (p. 489). She added, \\"It is only now that I fully realise, looking back over my wartime output, that I produced an incredible amount of stuff over those years.\\"Christie. An Autobiography. (p. 509). One of those books was Come, Tell Me How You Live. She wrote this book \\"out of nostalgia\\" feeling badly the separation from Max and wanting to recapture the \\"poignant remembrance of our days in Arpachiyah and Syria.\\" She admitted herself that it was \\"light-hearted and frivolous\\" but that it was an accurate reflection of the time and events that the book portrays.Christie. An Autobiography. (p. 500). Christie finished the book in June 1945, one month after a delighted reunion with her husband and passed it round for comment and opinion about the suitability for publication. Supportive of the work was Stephen Glanville (who had previously assisted with the play Akhnaton and pushed Christie into writing Death Comes as the End), Edmund Cork and Max himself to who it was given as a homecoming present. Less enthusiastic was Sidney Smith, Keeper of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum. He was a family friend and cautioned her that, \\"while the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable reading, I am not quite sure that you would be wise to print it at all.\\"Morgan. (p. 252). Another party who was unenthusiastic about the book was her publisher, William Collins and Sons, who were \\"suspicious and disapproving\\" but \\"the book was a success, and I think they then regretted that paper was so short.\\"Christie. An Autobiography. (p. 501). Christie's chronology is concatenated and somewhat confused in the book from the actual events of the 1930s although she never specifies any year. In the last two months of 1934, Christie joined Max and a young architect Robin Macartney (called Mac in the book) on a surveying expedition in Syria.Morgan. (p. 208). Mallowan's previous expedition and the first he commanded had been in Arpachiyah, north-east of Ninevah in Iraq in 1933 but that country had become too dangerous, hence the move. In describing the departure from Victoria Station, Christie names her daughter Rosalind as being fourteen when she was in fact one year older. Robin Macartney was a talented though shy draughtsman who later drew the dustjackets for four of Christie's 1930's UK editions (Murder in Mesopotamia, Murder in the Mews, Death on the Nile and Appointment with Death). She also wrote how she unsuccessfully tried to make herself like cigarettes by smoking two a day for six months. Max also tried to introduce her to various wines, but acknowledged defeat, so had the battle of obtaining water for her in restaurants. The book then gives the impression that only one season was exclusively conducted at Chagar Bazar whereas the Mallowans were there for two years (1935‚Äì36). The narrative then further complicates matters by stating that other members joined these first expeditions such as Colonel Burn (referred to as \\"the Colonel\\" in the book) and Louis Osman (called \\"Bumps\\" after his own description of the Tells). In reality these two members and others joined the expedition in the spring of 1937 when the team extended their efforts to excavating not just at Chagar Bazar but also Tell Brak.Morgan. (p. 213). The chronology then reverts to being correct when the Mallowans finish at these sites and move for a short period of time to the Balikh Valley in 1938. In 1939 the international situation was deemed to be too dangerous to continue and the Mallowans did not recommence their archaeological work until 1947 with another surveying expedition, this time returning to Iraq.Morgan. (pp. 266‚Äì67). Reception and critical analysis Christie described the book in her own foreword as, \\"small beer ‚Äì a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\\". There is little effort made to educate the reader in the ancient history of the places that are being excavated or in the methods of archaeology itself. Instead she paints a vivid picture of the human side of their expeditions and the personalities, both European and Asiatic, involved. The latter, in particular, are presented in a very sympathetic manner. Christie's infectious enthusiasm for the region, its peoples and the life they led while working there comes through in the work in a way which led Jacquetta Hawkes (who worked with the Mallowans in Nimrud in the 1950s) to describe the book in a foreword to the 1983 Bodley Head edition as \\"a pure pleasure to read\\". In her 2007 biography of Christie, Laura Thompson writes that the book, \\"is written to please one person, at least: her husband. It has a slightly manic style, as different as can be from that of her fiction, although in its way the book is equally artful\\".Thompson, Laura. Agatha Christie, An English Mystery. (p. 315) Headline, 2007 Professor Rushbrook Williams in The Times Literary Supplement of 28 December 1946 was less impressed: ‚ÄúThe enthusiasts of detective fiction who regard the publication of a new ‚ÄúAgatha Christie‚Äù as a landmark will experience something of a shock when they turn over these pages. Here is no ingenious plot, no artfully contrived love-interest, no unmasking after satisfying suspense, of the horrid criminal. While those who know something of archaeological work in the Near East, and recognise in Mrs Mallowan‚Äôs minor misfortunes and victimisations an echo of their own experiences, will sometimes chuckle as they read, the ordinary person will find the whole thing too long drawn out. The book, indeed, is reminiscent of the ‚Äòletters from dear Uncle William‚Äô types of literature ‚Äì excellent for reading aloud by those, and to those, who know Uncle William, but a shade tedious to persons outside the family circle.‚ÄùThe Times Literary Supplement, 28 December 1946 (p. 644) Elizabeth Monroe in the 24 November 1946 issue of The Observer opined that, \\"For all its flippancy the book is a contribution to literature on the Middle East. For it contains nostalgic descriptions of the profusion of mounds that mark bygone lives, and of the silence that surrounds them now, and of the flowers that cover them if you arrive on the right morning in the spring.\\"The Observer, 24 November 1946 (p. 5) A review by \\"H.J.F.\\" in The Guardian's issue of 22 November 1946 stated that the idea of writing the book was, \\"characteristically bright\\" and concluded, \\"The reader need not expect to find anything here about the famous Mallowan excavations which have done so much to fill out the heretofore thin web of the story of the origins of cultivation. That is to be sought in learned journals, and Agatha Christie's part therein is no small one. We wonder how many of the people who enjoy her books think of their being written, as often as not, in the desert amid mounds of forgotten cities in a region that was once full of life.\\"The Guardian, 22 November 1946 (p. 3) John Lanchester described the book as \\"a serious contender for the least revealing autobiographical book ever written, strongly rivalled by her Autobiography, which does at least contain some factual details from her childhood.\\" References to other works As well as a foreword and a short epilogue (dated spring 1944), Christie provides a poem A-sitting on a Tell which mimics the White Knight's poem, Haddocks' Eyes (See Explanation of the book's title above). Christie references this allusion by way of a printed apology to Carroll. The line \\"Come, tell me how you live!\\" is also quoted by the character of Jane Harding in Book III, Chapter I(i) of Giant's Bread, her 1930 novel published under the pseudonym of Mary Westmacott.

ZNF238 also regulates repressed genes that, if left unchecked, can lead to glioma progression. Furthermore, an absence of ZNF238 results in upregulation of the epithelial- mesenchymal transition process. In tumors such as medulloblastomas, the loss of ZNF238 can disorganize the tumor's cellular divisional processes, resulting in a cellularly diverse neoplasm. This new diversity has been observed to increase the invasiveness of the tumor, yielding proliferation into more areas of the brain than before the loss of ZNF238.

In 1981, he again returned to South Africa to become head of the Africa Desk at the Department of Foreign Affairs and held that position for four years. Ambassador to Canada Babb's mission as Ambassador to Canada began in 1985 while South Africa was in crisis and international pressure on Pretoria was mounting. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney threatened to break off diplomatic relations with the country when he spoke at the United Nations. During his two-and-a-half year posting, Babb appeared on Canadian television more than 132 times and even more frequently on radio. He heavily lobbied politicians, journalists, intellectuals and universities in support of the Reagan Administration's policy of \\"constructive engagement\\" rather than sanctions or divestment.

Corin is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated by PCSK6. Corin exhibits a trypsin-like catalytic activity favoring basic residues at the P1 position. Human corin contains 19 N-glycosylation sites. N-glycans promote corin expression on the cell surface and protect corin from metalloproteinase-mediated shedding.  Function  Corin converts the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) precursor, pro-ANP, to mature ANP, a cardiac hormone that regulates salt-water balance and blood pressure. In mice, corin deficiency prevents pro-ANP processing and causes salt-sensitive hypertension. Corin may also function as a pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide convertase. Corin-mediated ANP production in the pregnant uterus promotes spiral artery remodeling and trophoblast invasion. CORIN mutations have been reported in patients with preeclampsia.

Since its discovery in 1999, PLAC1 has been found to play a role in placental development and maintenance, several gestational disorders including preeclampsia, fetal development and a large number of cancers. PLAC1 Genomics PLAC1 is located on the long arm of the X-chromosome at Xq26.3. The gene consists of six Exons spanning nearly 200Kb (GRCh38/hgs38; X:134,565,838 - 134,764,322). The entire coding sequence plus the 3‚Äô UTR and part of the 5‚Äô UTR constitute Exon 6 while Exons 1 ‚Äì 5 contain variously spliced elements of the rest of the 5‚ÄôUTR including two independently regulated promoters. These two promoters, termed P1 (or distal) and P2 (or proximal) are located in Exons 1 and 4 respectively. They have been shown to produce transcripts simultaneously though P1 transcription predominates in cancers and P2 transcription predominates in placentae[7]. PLAC1 Phylogenetics From its initial description, the consensus is that PLAC1 is highly conserved and that this conservation reflects an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the placenta[8]. A detailed study of the PLAC1 gene and protein among 54 placental mammal species representing twelve crown orders confirms a high level of conservation under the control of strict purifying selection[9]. Further, comparative genomic sequences from two marsupials, the opossum (Mondelphis domestica) and the wallaby (Macropus eugenii), a monotreme, the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), two avians, the chicken (Gallus gallus) and the finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and two fish, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the stickleback (Gasterosteus arculeatus) spanning the syntenic X-chromosome region from PHD finger protein 6 (PHD6) through Factor 9 (F9) were screened for any sequences similar to PLAC1. The screen showed that PLAC1 appeared in the animal genome concurrent with the emergence of the Placentalia some 165,000,000 years ago[10]. PLAC1 Function Discovery of PLAC1 resulted from an examination of the region around the human hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) gene aimed at determining whether or not a placenta-specific protein was encoded there. This question was raised because the region was believed to be involved in both placental and fetal pathologies. Once identified, PLAC1 and its mouse ortholog Plac1 were found to be expressed throughout gestation[11,12]. It was quickly established that PLAC1 expression is specific to trophoblast cells and that it is a critical element in establishing and maintaining a normal placenta. Expression was further localized to the apical region of the syncytiotrophoblast, the leading, invasive part of the developing embryo[13]. PLAC1 expression terminates at the onset of labor and PLAC1 mRNAs clear the peripheral maternal circulatory system soon after delivery[14-16]. Recognition that PLAC1 plays an important role in first establishing the placenta and, subsequently, in maintaining it throughout gestation leads to the idea that PLAC1 may play a role in gestational issues from infertility to premature birth. An important contribution to this idea is the observation that a Plac1 knockout mouse model exhibited both placentomegaly in the dams and growth restriction in the pups[8,17]. Numerous human gestational issues have been associated with abnormal PLAC1 expression including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)[18-20], premature birth[21,22], implantation failure[23‚Äì26], and preeclampsia[27-33]. Several of these studies have sought to develop PLAC1 assays into diagnostic tools with mixed success. PLAC1 and Cancer While it has been clearly established that PLAC1 is truly placenta- specific, almost from the outset it was also clear that PLAC1 is co-opted in human cancers. The first evidence that PLAC1 is co-opted in cancer was published in 2006[34]. Since then, PLAC1 expression has been demonstrated in more than a dozen human cancers and in at least one hundred human cancer cell lines. Among the cancers in which PLAC1 expression is evident are gastric cancers[35-37], colon/colorectal cancers[37-39], liver cancers[40,41], pancreatic cancers[42], lung cancers[43], and breast cancers[44-49]. In nearly all cases, PLAC1 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Nowhere is this more true than in cancers of the male and female reproductive tract. That is, prostate cancer[50,51], uterine cancer[52], ovarian cancer[53,54] and cervical cancer[55] all have demonstrated a positive correlation between PLAC1 expression and prognosis. In 2005, PLAC1 expression in differentiating fibroblasts was shown to be regulated by fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7)[56]. This regulatory relationship has since been shown to be central to Akt Serine/Threonine kinase 1-mediated cancer cell proliferation[57]. PLAC1 forms a cell surface complex with FGF7and the FGFR2IIIb receptor which then activates a cascade leading to Akt phosphorylation. Expression of PLAC1is, in turn, partially determined by the p53 tumor suppressor[58]. PLAC1 expression is suppressed by wild-type p53 but increases in the presence of mutated or absent p53[54]. PLAC1 Immunotherapy PLAC1 is classified as a ‚Äúcancer-testis antigen‚Äù as it is preferentially expressed in trophoblasts and tumors. In addition to results associating PLAC1 expression with risk of various cancers as well as with prognosis, the ability of PLAC1 to elicit an immune response suggests that its specificity could be harnessed therapeutically. One group in particular is pioneering the potential[59]. Using anti-PLAC1/drug conjugates they have shown that PLAC1-based immunotherapy is highly promising[50, 51].

JARID1B belongs to the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase superfamily.  Function  Jarid1B (also known as KDM5B or PLU1) is in the family of JHDM genes. These are responsible for demethylation of tri- and di-methylated lysines in the 4 position of histone 3 (H3K4me3 and H3K4me2). Jarid1B is a multidomain enzyme that is part of the subfamily KDM5. The whole Jarid1 family is a protein family that possesses H3K4 histone demethylase activity. Jarid1B has been implicated in the development of prostate, breast, and skin cancer and also has been associated with melanoma maintenance. Knockout mice (Jarid1b‚àí/‚àí) produced are viable in neonatal life. These mice do exhibit the phenotype of premature mortality, decreased fertility in female mice, reduction in body weight and impairment in mammary gland development. It also acted to decrease serum estrogen levels and caused reduced mammary epithelial cell proliferation in the early stages of puberty. These Jarid1b‚àí/‚àí mice seem to be greatly affected in many regulators of the development of mammy development such as FOXA1 and estrogen receptor Œ±. However, others have shown that a Jarid1B knockout embryos usually have neonatal lethality due to the failure of their respiratory system. Knockout embryos have also been seen to have several different neural defects including: disorganized cranial nerves, increased incidences of exencephaly, and defects in eye development.

The building was constructed for the use of the city's Royal High School, and gained its alternative name as a result of a proposal in the 1970s for it to house a devolved Scottish Assembly. After the Royal High School was relocated in 1968, the building became available and was refurbished to accommodate a new devolved legislature for Scotland. However, the 1979 devolution referendum failed to provide sufficient backing for a devolved assembly. Its debating chamber was later used for meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee, the committee of Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom House of Commons with constituencies in Scotland. Subsequently, the building has been used as offices for departments of Edinburgh City Council, including The Duke of Edinburgh's Award unit and the Sports and Outdoor Education unit. With the passage of the Scotland Act 1998 and the introduction of Scottish devolution in 1999, the Old Royal High School was again mooted as a potential home for the new Scottish Parliament. Eventually, however, the Scotland Office decided to site the new legislature in a purpose- built structure in the Holyrood area of the Canongate. A number of uses have been suggested for the building, including a home for a Scottish National Photography Centre. In 2015, The City of Edinburgh Council, which currently owns the building, has initiated a project to lease it to be used as a luxury hotel. Edinburgh's original Parliament House is in the Old Town just off the Royal Mile and currently houses the Court of Session. These were the buildings of the former Parliament of Scotland which existed before the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 and the foundation of a British Parliament sitting at London's Palace of Westminster. Construction and Royal High School The Royal High School in 1829 The A-listed building was erected for the Royal High School between 1826 and 1829 on the south face of Calton Hill as part of Edinburgh's Acropolis, at a cost to the Town Council of ¬£34,000.Murray, History, p. 45. Of this ¬£500 was given by King George IV 'as a token of royal favour towards a School, which, as a royal foundation, had conferred for ages incalculable benefits on the community'.Barclay, Tounis Scule, p. 60. It was designed in a neo-classical Greek Doric style by Thomas Hamilton, who modelled the portico and Great Hall on the Hephaisteion of Athens.Murray, History, p. 46. Paired with St. George's Hall, Liverpool, as one of the ‚Äòtwo finest buildings in the kingdom‚Äô by Alexander Thomson in 1866, it has been praised as 'the architect's supreme masterpiece and the finest monument of the Greek revival in Scotland'.David Watkin, ‚ÄòElmes, Harvey Lonsdale (1814‚Äì1847)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Following the successful referendum in 1997 that led to the formation of the Scottish Parliament, the Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, accepted an alternative proposal to erect a new Parliament building at Holyrood, reportedly due to concern that the Old Royal High School had become a 'nationalist shibboleth'.Holyrood Inquiry (3.34), pp. 45-46. Retrieved on 3 September 2007. Critics also contended that the Calton Hill site was relatively inaccessible, lacked sufficient office space, and would be difficult to secure against a terrorist attack.Kenny Farquharson and Joanne Robertson, ‚ÄòCalton Hill backers admit it is too small for parliament‚Äô, Sunday Times, 2 April 2000, Home News Section, p. 2 ‚Äì Scotland News.David Denver, Scotland Decides: The Devolution Issue and the 1997 Referendum. London, Frank Cass, 2000, pp. 192-3. . The Under-Secretary of State, Lord Sewel, remarked of this decision: ‚ÄòMany people understandably assumed that the Old Royal High School building on Calton Hill would be the automatic choice for the site. As I say, that is perfectly understandable given that it was prepared for a similar purpose, to house a parliament in the 1970s. During the wasted years of the previous Administration, it remained a symbol of hope in Scotland. Clearly, there is great sentimental attachment to it in the hearts of the people of Scotland. However, time has moved on since then, in much the same way as our vision of a parliament has evolved.‚Äô The nearby Governor's House on Calton Hill had also been proposed as a residence for the First Minister of Scotland instead of Bute House in Edinburgh's New Town. https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/king-of-the-castle---alex- salmond-1083795 Prospective and future uses The Old Royal High School In 2004, Edinburgh City Council gave its support to a plan by HM The Queen's former royal press secretary, Michael Shea, to use the Old Royal High School as a Scottish National Photography Centre at a cost of ¬£20 million. The proposal failed to gain the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, seen as a key funder.‚ÄòHolyrood hold-up casts shadow over photography project‚Äô, The Times, 11 November 2005, Home News Section, p. 32 ‚Äì Scotland.Michael Blackley, 'Boost for ¬£20m photo centre bid at Royal High'.

In 2010 Edinburgh City Council announced a plan to use the building as a hotel and public art gallery, described as an \\"arts hotel\\". The cost was estimated at ¬£35 million, and Duddingston House Properties (DHP) were awarded the project to prepare a design. DHP were awarded a conditional 125-year lease with the City Council retaining ownership of the building.'New life' for capital's landmark, BBC News, 3 February 2010. Retrieved on 4 February 2010. In 2015, another proposal was brought forward to use the building as a luxury hotel at an estimated cost of ¬£55 million. The plan, put forward by DHP and Urbanist Hotels, involved the construction of two additional six-story wings on either side of the building in a modern architectural style and the hotel would be managed by Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. It was opposed by Scotland's national heritage agency Historic Scotland, Edinburgh's civic trust, the Cockburn Association, the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland, Edinburgh City Council planning department and over 1,700 people who sent in objections. The Royal High School Preservation Trust also put forward an alternative plan costing over ¬£25 million in 2015 to use the building to house St Mary's Music School. The headteacher of the St. Mary's Music School, Dr Kenneth Taylor, estimated the cost in the region of ¬£35 million. An American philanthropist, Carol Colburn Grigor, pledged to underwrite this proposal through the Dunard Fund. In 2015 the Dunard Fund gave the Royal High School Preservation Trust ¬£1.5 million held in a restricted reserve which can be released only for expenditure connected to purchasing the building. The Dunard Fund has the power to appoint 5 of the 6 Trustees of the Royal High School Presevation Trust. The Fund has two major projects it intends to support and, \\"therefore, as a matter of strategy, the trustees are retaining a substantial part of available funds at present.\\" Edinburgh Council rejected the hotel plans in December 2015, following which the developers appealed the decision to the Scottish Government in 2016 but then put the appeal on hold and submitted an alternative reduced plan. Edinburgh Council accepted plans for the St. Mary's Music School in 2016 but the hotel developers said their 2010 contract gave them sole rights to the site until 2022. Over 3,000 people submitted objections to the alternative hotel plan put forward by the developers Scotsman, 21 August 2017 and in August 2017, Edinburgh Council rejected the alternative hotel plan. A public inquiry to determine the future use of the building opened on 4 September 2018. During that inquiry, the Director of Edinburgh World Heritage, Adam Wilkinson, admitted to Photoshopping a picture of the proposed hotel development that was shown to the public at a Save the Old Royal High School meeting at Central Hall in Tollcross in March 2017. That meeting was held with the support of both Edinburgh World Heritage and the Cockburn Association. The doctored image showed the proposed extensions to the school as significantly bigger than detailed in the submitted plans, indicating the proposals would have a greater impact on Calton Hill than was put forward by the developers.

It would appear that the name is derived from the London street of the same name, and that its application to the small cluster of houses that would become Bow Street was connected with the turnpiking of the main Aberystwyth to Machynlleth turnpike road from 1770 onwards.Owen, Hywel Wyn & Morgan, Richard, 'Bow Street', Dictionary of the Place-Names of Wales (Llandysul, 2007), pp. 42-43 It may be that the choice of name was influenced by the fact that the road does actually bend slightly at this point, and might therefore have been analogous to the ‚Äòbow‚Äô of the London Bow Street. There are two small lanes in the village which are also known locally by English names, these being Cock and Hen Street and Thread Needle Street (sometimes Thread and Needle Street),.Jones, Eddie, 'Adnabod Ardal 26: Cock and Hen Street a Thread Needle Street', Y Tincer, rhif 134, Rhagfyr 1990, p. 17. Supposed traditions associating the name Bow Street with a local magistrate do not appear to stand up to scrutiny, and probably developed later as a way of justifying the existence of an English place name in a predominantly Welsh-speaking area.Williams J. G., 'Bow Street (Mar. 26, 1873)', April 2, 1873 - Notes, Bye-Gones, Relating to Wales and the Border Counties, 1871-3, p. 155; Brierley, Geo. H., 'Chancery and Bow Street Cardiganshire', Notes and Queries, The Red Dragon: The National Magazine of Wales, Vol. X July‚ÄìDecember 1886, p. 80; Huws, Huw, 'Yr Enw Bow Street', Y Tincer, Rhif 2, Hydref 1977, p. 8; Jones, Eddie, 'Adnabod Ardal 26', Y Tincer, Rhif 134, Rhagfyr 1990, p. 17. In his seminal work on Cardiganshire placenames, Iwan Wmffre suggests that an earlier name for Bow Street may have been Rhyd-y-castell (ford of the castle).Wmffre, Iwan, 'Bow Street', The Place-Names of Cardiganshire, Vol. III, p. 1098 (BRA British Series 379 (III), 2004, ). But the ford of Rhyd-y-castell was actually located on the small lane called Cock and Hen Street, that runs alongside the Welsh Black (formerly the Black Lion) and leads towards Clarach and Llangorwen, and not on the main Aberystwyth to Machynlleth road where the first houses in Bow Street were built.Lewis, T., [Map of Gogerddan Estate, North Cardiganshire], August 1790 (NLW Gogerddan Map 232). Though there is no officially sanctioned Welsh equivalent to Bow Street, the author and novelist Tom Macdonald, who spent part of his childhood here, recounted that \\"old folk told me it was once called Nant-y-Fallen\\".Macdonald, Tom, Western Mail, 13 September 1975. The small stream still called Nant Afallen runs under the main road a little to the north of where the original hamlet of Bow Street first grew up, and was applied to the row of small cottages that once stood nearby. The name Nantyfallen was also later extended to refer to those cottages running up the slope from the brook towards Cross Street. Occasionally in Welsh writing the name Bow Street is spelt as Bwstryd.Macdonald, Tom (Translated by Morgan, Haydn), Y Tincer Tlawd (Cymdeithas Lyfrau Ceredigion, 1971), p.7.; Jones, Vernon, ‚ÄòNewid ddaeth ‚Ä¶‚Äô, Y Tincer, Rhif 257, Mawrth 2003, p. 11. Transport Bow Street station in 1962 Bow Street had a railway station on the Cambrian Coast Line until it closed in 1965 under the Beeching axe. Plans for the station to be reinstated were published in July 2016 and work started in January 2020 with the new station planned to be opened later in the year.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-36693214 A road leads down to Llandre and Borth on the coast. To the south is Comins Coch and to the east, Plas Gogerddan. From a junction in the village runs the mountain road to Rhayader. A new station has been approved to be built Tornado In the early hours of 28 November 2006, the village was struck by a tornado, that was rated T3 on the TORRO Scale. This caused structural damage to more than 20 houses, as well as uprooting trees, and damaging power-lines, caravans and a railway bridge. No injuries were reported. Some papers caught up in the tornado were found a week later, away in the village of Corris. Notable residents *Tom Macdonald (1900‚Äì1980), journalist and novelist *J. T.

(14 July 1900 - 15 June 1996) was a Danish-Icelandic soprano and a collector and distinguished interpreter of traditional music. Her most notable work is the Book of Folk Songs, a collection of 49 pieces with piano accompaniments by her stage partner, Austrian composer and pianist Ferdinand Rauter. It was first published in 1936 by Oxford University Press.Engel Lund's Book of Folk Songs Album Notes, Nimbus Records 2007 Lund was born to Danish parents on 14 July 1900 in Reykjav√≠k, where she spent her early childhood. At the age of 11, her parents moved back to Denmark, where she attended grammar school. She studied singing in Copenhagen, Paris, and finally in Germany. During that time, she developed a growing interest in folk songs and began working with Rauter. With the outbreak of the Second World War, she moved to London, where she would live through most of her professional career, as did Rauter (who, having effectively become a citizen of the Reich after the German annexation of Austria, was briefly interned early in the war). Concerts led them all over Europe, the United States, and Canada. Lund was renowned for her ability to present songs from many different countries in their original languages \\"completely without accent\\", and for speaking as many as 20 languages fluently.Janus Paluda \\"Obituary: Engel Lund\\".

Her recitals would always include a few Icelandic and Yiddish songs, of which she was particularly fond. Consequently, she stopped performing in Germany during the Nazi regime after authorities had asked her to refrain from presenting Jewish material. Having retired from the stage, she returned to Iceland, where she was awarded a professorship for life in singing at Reykjav√≠k Conservatory, teaching regularly until she was almost 90 years old.

On the one hand, it evokes the image of a student learning his lessons with this kind of teaching method almost without effort and on the other hand, a teacher teaching everything to even the \\"stupidest\\" pupil. Can also reference forceful teaching of someone's ideas, ideology, etc.  Etymology  The phrase \\"Nuremberg Funnel\\", familiar in German-speaking countries, has its origin in the title of a poetics textbook by the founders of the Pegnesischer Blumenorden and the Nuremberg poet, Georg Philipp Harsd√∂rffer (1607‚Äì1658), which appeared in Nuremberg in 1647 under the title of Poetischer Trichter. Die Teutsche Dicht- und Reimkunst, ohne Behuf der lateinischen Sprache, in VI Stunden einzugie√üen (Poetic funnel.

Because of the wide distribution of the work, the expression \\"Nuremberg funnel\\" became a common idiomatic expression. The idiom \\"to funnel something in\\" (to drum something in) or \\"to get something funneled in\\" (to get something drummed in) is even older than the image of the \\"Nuremberg Funnel\\"; it was first recorded in the collection of proverbs by Sebastian Franck in 1541, but without reference to the city of Nuremberg.See Lutz R√∂hrich: Lexikon der sprichw√∂rtlichen Redensarten.

This list of birds of North Carolina includes species documented in the U.S. state of North Carolina and accepted by the North Carolina Bird Records Committee (NCBRC) of the Carolina Bird Club. As of January 2019, there are 469 species and a species pair definitively included in the official list. Twelve additional species, one of which is identified only at the genus level, are on the list but classed as provisional. Between January 2019 and July 2020, four more species were reported to eBird. Of the resulting 486 species, 89 are rare anywhere in the state, 92 are rare in some part of the state or in a single season, six have been introduced to North America, and four are extinct. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in North Carolina as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags are used to designate some species: *(R) - Rare - a species whose report is reviewable by the NCBRC if the bird is found anywhere in North Carolina *(RC) - Rare coastal - a species whose report is reviewable by the NCBRC if the bird is found along the coast *(RD) - Rare downstate - a species whose report is reviewable by the NCBRC if the bird is found in the southern part of the state *(RI) - Rare inland - a species whose report is reviewable by the NCBRC if the bird is found away from the coast *(RM) - Rare in mountains - a species whose report is reviewable by the NCBRC if the bird is found in the mountainous part of the state *(RS) - Rare in spring - a species whose report is reviewable by the NCBRC if the bird is found in the spring *(I) - Introduced - a species introduced to North America by humans, either directly or indirectly *(E) - Extinct - a recent species that no longer exists *(P) - Provisional list - a species that has been approved by the NCBRC but is known only from sight records Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Wood ducks Mallards Northern shoveler Hooded merganser Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. Forty-six species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Black-bellied whistling-duck, Dendrocygna autumnalis (RI) *Fulvous whistling-duck, Dendrocygna bicolor *Snow goose, Anser caerulescens *Ross's goose, Anser rossii *Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons *Brant, Branta bernicla *Barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis (R) *Cackling goose, Branta hutchinsii *Canada goose, Branta canadensis *Mute swan, Cygnus olor *Trumpeter swan, Cygnus buccinator (RI) *Tundra swan, Cygnus columbianus *Wood duck, Aix sponsa *Garganey, Spatula querquedula (P) (R) *Blue-winged teal, Spatula discors *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera (RI) *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata *Gadwall, Mareca strepera *Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope *American wigeon, Mareca americana *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos *American black duck, Anas rubripes *Mottled duck, Anas fulvigula (RI) *White-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis (R) *Northern pintail, Anas acuta *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca *Canvasback, Aythya valisineria *Redhead, Aythya americana *Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris *Tufted duck, Aythya fuligula (R) *Greater scaup, Aythya marila *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis *King eider, Somateria spectabilis (RI) *Common eider, Somateria mollissima (RI) *Harlequin duck, Histrionicus histrionicus (RI) *Surf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata *White-winged scoter, Melanitta deglandi *Black scoter, Melanitta americana *Long-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis *Bufflehead, Bucephala albeola *Common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula *Hooded merganser, Lophodytes cucullatus *Common merganser, Mergus merganser *Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator *Masked duck, Nomonyx dominicus (R) *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis New World quail Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. One species has been recorded in North Carolina. *Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus Pheasants, grouse, and allies Ruffed grouse Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of 1.5-1.8 meters (almost 6 feet), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are game and are sometimes hunted for food. In all North Carolinian species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Three species in this family have been recorded in North Carolina. *Wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo *Ruffed grouse, Bonasa umbellus (RD) *Ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus (I) Grebes Pied-billed grebe Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium- large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. Six species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Pied-billed grebe, Podilymbus podiceps *Horned grebe, Podiceps auritus *Red- necked grebe, Podiceps grisegena *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis *Western grebe, Aechmorphorus occidentalis (RI) *Clark's grebe, Aechmorphorus clarkii (P) (R) Pigeons and doves Mourning dove Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. Seven species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Rock pigeon, Columba livia (I) *Band-tailed pigeon, Patagioenas fasciata (R) *Eurasian collared-dove, Streptopelia decaocto (I) *Passenger pigeon, Ectopistes migratorius (E) *Common ground dove, Columbina passerina *White-winged dove, Zenaida asiatica (RM) *Mourning dove, Zenaida macroura Cuckoos Black-billed cuckoo Order: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae The family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are brood parasites. Four species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Smooth-billed ani, Crotophaga ani (R) *Groove-billed ani, Crotophaga sulcirostris (P) (R) *Yellow-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus *Black-billed cuckoo, Coccyzus erythropthalmus Nightjars and allies Common nighthawk Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae Nightjars are medium- sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet which are of little use for walking and long, pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. Five species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Lesser nighthawk, Chordeiles acutipennis (R) *Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor *Antillean nighthawk, Chordeiles gundlachii (R) *Chuck-will's-widow, Antrostomus carolinensis *Eastern whip-poor-will, Antrostomus vociferus Swifts Order: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. Three species have been recorded in North Carolina, although one was only identified to genus. *Swift species, Cypseloides sp. (P) (R) *Chimney swift, Chaetura pelagica *Common swift, Apus apus (R) Hummingbirds Ruby- throated hummingbird Order: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Eleven species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Mexican violetear, Colibri thalassinus (R) *Green-breasted mango, Anthracothorax prevostii (R) *Ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris *Black-chinned hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri (RM) *Anna's hummingbird, Calypte anna (R) *Calliope hummingbird, Selasphorus calliope *Rufous hummingbird, Selasphorus rufus *Allen's hummingbird, Selasphorus sasin (R) *Broad-tailed hummingbird, Selasphorus platycercus (R) *Broad-billed hummingbird, Cynanthus latirostris (R) *Buff- bellied hummingbird, Amazilia yucatanensis (R) Rails, gallinules, and coots Virginia rail Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. Nine species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans (RM) *King rail, Rallus elegans *Virginia rail, Rallus limicola *Sora, Porzana carolina *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus *Yellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis *Black rail, Laterallus jamaicensis Limpkin Order: GruiformesFamily: Aramidae The limpkin is a large bird in a monotypic family. It is similar in appearance to the rails, but skeletally it is closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks. *Limpkin, Aramus guarauna (R) Cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \\"dances\\". Two species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Sandhill crane, Antigone canadensis *Whooping crane, Grus americana (R) (not established) Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the avocets and stilts. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills. Two species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Black-necked stilt, Himantopus mexicanus *American avocet, Recurvirostra americana Oystercatchers American oystercatcher Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Haematopodidae The oystercatchers are large, obvious and noisy plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prying open molluscs. One species has been recorded in North Carolina. *American oystercatcher, Haematopus palliatus Plovers and lapwings Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. Eleven species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Northern lapwing, Vanellus vanellus (R) *Black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola *American golden-plover, Pluvialis dominica *Pacific golden-plover, Pluvialis fulva (R) *Killdeer, Charadrius vociferus *Semipalmated plover, Charadrius semipalmatus *Piping plover, Charadrius melodus *Common ringed plover, Charadrius hiaticula (R) *Wilson's plover, Charadrius wilsonia (RI) *Snowy plover, Charadrius nivosus (RI) *Mountain plover, Charadrius montanus (R) Sandpipers and allies Willet Sanderling Ruddy turnstone Wilson's snipe Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. Thirty-seven species have been recorded in North Carolina,. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus *Long-billed curlew, Numenius americanus (RI) *Bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica (R) *Black-tailed godwit, Limosa limosa (R) *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica *Marbled godwit, Limosa fedoa *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Red knot, Calidris canutus *Ruff, Calidris pugnax (RI) *Sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata (R) *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus *Curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea (RI) *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina *Purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima (RI) *Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii *Little stint, Calidris minuta (R) *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis *Buff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis (RS) *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla *Western sandpiper, Calidris mauri *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus *Long-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus *American woodcock, Scolopax minor *Wilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularius *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes *Willet, Tringa semipalmata *Spotted redshank, Tringa erythropus (R) *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor *Red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus *Red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius Skuas and jaegers Pomarine jaeger Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae They are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers. Five species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Great skua, Stercorarius skua (RI) *South polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki (RI) *Pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (RM) *Parasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus (RM) *Long-tailed jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus (RM) Auks, murres, and puffins Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Alcidae Alcids are superficially similar to penguins due to their black-and-white colors, their upright posture, and some of their habits; however, they are only distantly related to the penguins and are able to fly. Auks live on the open sea, only deliberately coming ashore to nest. Seven species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Dovekie, Alle alle (RI) *Common murre, Uria aalge (R) *Thick-billed murre, Uria lomvia (RI) *Razorbill, Alca torda (RI) *Black guillemot, Cepphus grylle (R) *Long-billed murrelet, Brachyramphus perdix (R) *Atlantic puffin, Fratercula arctica (RI) Gulls, terns, and skimmers Laughing gull Ring-billed gull Royal tern Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Gulls are typically medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina. *Black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla (RI) *Sabine's gull, Xema sabini *Bonaparte's gull, Chroicocephalus philadelphia *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus (RM) *Little gull, Hydrocoloeus minutus (RM) *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan *Black-tailed gull, Larus crassirostris (P) (R) *Mew gull, Larus canus (R) *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis *California gull, Larus californicus (RI) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus *Iceland gull, Larus glaucoides (RM) *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus (RM) *Slaty-backed gull, Larus schistisagus (P) (R) *Glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus (RM) *Great black- backed gull, Larus marinus (RM) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus (RI) *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscata (RM) *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus (RM) *Least tern, Sternula antillarum (RM) *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica (RI) *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia *Black tern, Chlidonias niger *White-winged tern, Sterna leucopterus (P) (R) *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii (RI) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea (RI) *Forster's tern, Sterna forsteri *Royal tern, Thalasseus maxima (RM) *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis (RM) *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger (RM) Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

Two species have been recorded in North Carolina. *White-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus (RM) *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus (RI) Loons Common loon Order: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae Loons are aquatic birds, the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but are almost hopeless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body. Three species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Red-throated loon, Gavia stellata *Pacific loon, Gavia pacifica (RI) *Common loon, Gavia immer Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are amongst the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. Two species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Yellow-nosed albatross, Thalassarche chlororhynchos (R) *Black-browed albatross, Thalassarche melanophris (R) Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. All three species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus (RI) *White-faced storm-petrel, Pelagodroma marina (RI) *Black-bellied storm-petrel, Fregetta tropica (R) Northern storm-petrels Leach's storm-petrel Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. Four species have been recorded in North Carolina. *European storm-petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus (RI) *Swinhoe's storm- petrel, Hydrobates monorhis (R) *Leach's storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous (RI) *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro (RI) Shearwaters and petrels Sooty shearwater Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.

They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills and ibises use to clean off fish slime. Storks lack a pharynx and are mute. One species has been recorded in North Carolina. *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black- and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. One species has been recorded in North Carolina. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens (RI) Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. Four species have been recorded in North Carolina. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra (RI) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster (RI) *Red-footed booby, Sula sula (R) *Northern gannet, Morus bassanus (RI) Anhingas Anhinga Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are cormorant-like water birds with very long necks and long, straight beaks.

History The Fiat 1500 was introduced at the November 1935 Salone dell'automobile di Milano (Milan Motor Show). It was powered by a overhead valve straight-six engine, producing at 4,400 rpm. The transmission had four speeds, and synchromesh on the top two gears. Top speed was . For the first time on a Fiat there were independent suspensions at the front, of the Dubonnet type. The frame was X-shaped, with a boxed centre section. Fiat offered two factory body styles, a 4-door pillarless saloon with suicide doors at the rear, and a 2-door convertible with suicide doors as well; both lacked a boot lid, as the luggage compartment was only accessible folding the rear seat, and carried an external spare wheel in a recess at the rear of the body. As an alternative the 1500 was also available as bare chassis, and numerous cars received coachbuilt bodies. =1939: the 1500 B= An improved, second series model was introduced in 1939, distinguished as was Fiat's custom at the time by a letter added to the model name: the Fiat 1500 B.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. It had more powerful brakes and an handbrake acting on the transmission through a band brake instead than on the rear axle drum brakes as before. The 1500 B was otherwise virtually undistinguishable from the original model. =1940: the 1500 C= The 1500 B was short lived as in 1940 Fiat replaced it with the 1500 C, sporting a redesigned and more conventional looking front end. Following the look introduced with the Fiat 2800 flagship of 1938, the grille was pointed, taller and more upright than before‚Äîthe so-called musone, big snout. The headlamps ceased to be integrated in the front wings. Beginning with this model the sole factory body option was the 4-door saloon. A 1500 C or D, showing the redesigned front end used from 1940 onwards. =1946: the 1500 D= In 1946, after World War Two, Fiat resumed production of pre-war models, the 500, 1100 and the 1500 C. Since the ongoing development of all-new cars would take some years, improvements were made to keep these vehicles of 1930s vintage competitive on the market. The resulting 1500 D was introduced at the 1948 Turin Motor Show, alongside the updated 1100 B and the 500 B Giardiniera (station wagon). Externally the 1500 D was largely unchanged from the 1940 1500 C, while there were significant mechanical differences. The front Dubonnet suspension had been replaced by a double wishbone design similar to the 1100s; therefore the steering had to be changed as well. The engine had received a twin-choke Weber 30 DCR carburettor, a higher 6.2:1 compression ratio and other changes, pushing output to ; top speed rose to . Between 1948‚Äì49, production of this model amounted to over 2,800. =1949: the 1500 E= The fifth and final version of the 1500, the 1500 E, was first shown at the 1949 Fiera del Levante in Bari, together with the similarly updated 1100 E. The main distinguishing feature of these \\"E\\" models was their luggage compartment, accessible from outside the car; the previously rear-mounted spare wheel had to be carried inside the car, bolted inside the newly acquired boot lid. In the case of the 1500, the body aft of the rear doors was redesigned: the sloping back, almost unchanged since 1935, gave way to three- box styling. Together with more robust bumpers, this increased the overall length of the car by some . The rear window was one-piece instead of being split, and the running boards were integrated in the body-side stampings. Other notable revisions were made to the transmission: the clutch was strengthened, synchromesh was added to second gear, and inside the cabin there was a column-mounted shifter. In total about 1,700 1500 Es were made, for a grand total of about 46,000 1500s of all models. After 15 years of production, in 1950 the 1500 was replaced by the groundbreaking unibody Fiat 1400, the marque's first all-new post-war car.

This enzyme has also been identified as PLA2G16, HRASLS3, HREV107, HREV107-3, MGC118754 or H-REV107-1 from studies on class II tumor suppression but not on its enzymatic properties. AdPLA is encoded by a 1.3 kilobase AdPLA messenger RNA and is an 18 kDa protein. It belongs to a superfamily of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes and is found primarily in adipose tissue. AdPLA regulates adipocyte lipolysis and release of fatty acids through a G-protein coupled pathway involving prostaglandin and EP3. It has also been reported to play a crucial role in the development of obesity in mouse models.  Enzyme characteristics  AdPLA has been characterized in Group XVI as a separate subgroup of the PLA2 family for its distinct properties from other known PLA2s. It bears similarity to its PLA2 family in phospholipase activity and calcium dependence. Unlike other PLA2 enzymes, AdPLA is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue at higher levels than in the rest of the body, more so in white adipose tissue (WAT) than brown adipose tissue (BAT). Its primary enzymatic function is to catalyze the preferential hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholines at the sn-2 position, generating free fatty acids. AdPLA active site with labeled His-23 and Cys-113 residues are responsible for AdPLA catalysis.AdPLA contains a membrane-spanning domain on the C-terminus, which localizes intracellularly for phospholipase activity in proximity to cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1). His-23 and Cys-113 residues have been shown to be essential in AdPLA activity, which differs from the known His/Asp catalytic dyad or Ser/His/Asp catalytic triad of other PLA2 enzymes. Gln-129 and Asn-112 have also been shown to be necessary in catalysis but their role is not known. AdPLA activity is calcium and pH dependent. Calcium binds to AdPLA and forms a positively charged oxyanion hole to stabilize a negatively charged transition state, similar to other PLA2 active sites. Whereas asparagine binds to calcium in other PLA2 enzymes, the residue that participates in the creation of oxyanion hole in AdPLA has not yet been verified. Optimum AdPLA activity occurs in relatively basic conditions, between pH 7 and 9, to facilitate formation of a histidine-water complex and subsequent fatty acid hydrolysis.  Function  Studies on AdPLA have shown lipolysis regulation following a G-protein coupled pathway in WAT. WAT is responsible for releasing fatty acids from stored triacylglycerol as energy sources for other tissues which is regulated predominately by AdPLA over other phospholipase A2 enzymes. Lipolysis is inversely related to AdPLA activity. AdPLA catalyzes the rate- limiting step, production of arachidonic acid, for the production of prostaglandins, specifically prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 enters the signaling pathway binding to G protein-coupled receptor (EP3) which inhibits adenylyl cyclase. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase decreases the conversion of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. Lower levels of cAMP decrease the activity of protein kinase A to phosphorylate, thereby activating, hormone-sensitive lipase. The opposite effect can be reached with inactivated AdPLA, decreasing PGE2 concentration and EP3 activity, leading to an increase in cAMP and lipase activity. This mechanism was postulated on the basis that the predominant signaling protein and receptor present in WAT are PGE2 and EP3. These results were based on a mouse model and although they are mammalian cells, it has not been shown to apply to human cells.  Effects on obesity  Obesity has been attributed to adipocyte hypertrophy, where triacylglycerol synthesis exceeds lipolysis, resulting in elevated triacylglycerol storage. Previous studies have associated obesity with endocrine factors and have led pharmacological work toward hormone regulation. Studies on AdPLA deficient mice have shown that the enzyme increased lipolysis in WAT as a result of decreased lipolysis regulation. AdPLA deficiency was shown to reduce adipose tissue mass for mice in both standard and high fat diets. Adipocyte hypotrophy was attributed primarily to reduced triacylglyceride content in WAT from lipolysis, while adipocyte differentiation did not play a role in reduced adipose tissue despite the effects of prostaglandins on adipogenesis. AdPLA defieciency also led to higher oxygen consumption due to the upreguation of genes involved in oxidative metabolism, increasing fatty acid oxidation. One upregulated gene in particular, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), has been shown to reduce diet-induced obesity. Studies on AdPLA deficient and genetically obese mice (leptin deficiency) have also shown similar effects, reduced adipose tissue mass and increased lipolysis by reduction in PGE2 and EP3 activity. Fatty acid oxidation was also found to increase to levels of wild-type mice that were deficient in non-AdPLA deficient obese mice. Body composition also showed a higher percentage of water and lean tissue mass compared to non-AdPLA deficient obese mice. AdPLA deficiency also demonstrated adverse effects, increasing ectopic triglyceride storage and insulin resistance. Liver enlargement was attributed to higher fatty acid uptake and triacylglycerol content. Insulin stimulated glucose uptake and metabolism were also blunted in AdPLA deficiency, decreasing glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. Despite these side effects, AdPLA is a novel breakthrough in studying autocrine and paracrine action of AdPLA in regulating obesity and fat metabolism. These side effects have triggered new studies to be performed on reduction of AdPLA function as opposed to complete ablation.

Some of the artists who recorded tracks and albums in the studio were Bruce Springsteen, Dusty Springfield, Ramones, Janis Ian, Blood, Sweat & Tears and Melanie. It was named after telephone area code 914, which served as the area code for Rockland County (where the studio was located) until 2000.Rockland County is now in area code 845. Nearby Westchester County is still served by the area code.David Simons, Studio Stories, Backbeat Books, 2004, pp185-186 History 914 Sound Studios was created by Brooklyn, New York-born Brooks Arthur (born Arnold Brodsky), a well-known sound engineer of the era, who lived in Rockland County. 914 Studios was 20 minutes north of Washington Heights by car and 5 minutes away from the state border with New Jersey. Arthur later explained its genesis: ‚ÄúI was living in Valley Cottage, New York which is down Route 303 from Blauvelt, back in 1971, and I thought it would be a great idea to have a workshop where artists and producers could hang out for a week at a time, relax and build a record at affordable rates. New York City by-the-hour pricing was already getting expensive, and I envisioned a place where artists like Janis, Dusty Springfield and, later, Bruce would be able to roost for a while and create an album. We built a football field behind the studio and the great Blauvelt Diner was within walking distance. Bruce loved that place!\\"Classic Tracks: Janis Ian‚Äôs ‚ÄúAt Seventeen‚Äù 914 Sound Studios, which opened at a converted gas station in October 1970, was a subsidiary of A & R Recording. Arthur owned one-half, while the other half was split between A & R co-founder Phil Ramone, A & R executive Art Ward and engineer Don Frey. Bruce Springsteen began recording at 914 Sound Studios once he signed his first record deal, with Columbia Records in 1972. pp. 77‚Äì78. Manager and producer Mike Appel chose it in order to economize in using the $25,000 advance they had been given; he saw it as \\"a top-notch facility\\" that allowed \\"high quality at reasonable rates\\" due to its out-of-the-way location. Recordings made at the studio during 1972 would make their way onto Springsteen's debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and would also be used as demos for Appel's publishing company, Laurel Canyon Music Publishing. Some of these demos would later appear as radio-only releases (\\"The Fever\\") or on his late 1990s Tracks box set, or on innumerable bootleg recordings. All of Springsteen's second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, was recorded at 914 Sound in 1973. Still short on money, some members of Springsteen's E Street Band slept in a tent in back of the studio rather than rent a hotel room or commute to the Jersey Shore. p. 25. The membership of the band even changed temporarily due to the studio; Louis Lahav, the studio's resident sound engineer, provided the link whereby his wife, violinist and vocalist Suki Lahav, joined the band for six months. The first song for Springsteen's next album, the classic \\"Born to Run\\", was also recorded at 914 Sound in 1974. A New Jersey fan and a personal friend of Springsteen at the time, Barry Rebo (who later became the chairman of Emerging Pictures, a national network of digital cinema theaters), used his black-and- white Super-8 film camera to record Springsteen at the 914 Sound Studio. Springsteen labored there for months, between playing club dates, over the four-and-a-half minutes of \\"Born to Run\\". However, new Springsteen producer and future manager Jon Landau characterized 914 Sound as a \\"beat-up old funky studio\\" where, among other things, the piano, which was at the core of the songs, would not stay in tune. Landau also felt that the studio owners had not invested in the most up-to-date equipment and that the sound of the studio was dull.Santelli, Greetings From E Street, pp. 34‚Äì35. He moved recording of the remainder of the Born to Run album to The Record Plant in New York City.Appel, Down Thunder Road, pp. 125‚Äì126. Dusty Springfield recorded the songs for her intended-to-be 1974 album Longing at the studio, with Brooks Arthur producing, but for various reasons the album was abandoned. The Ramones recorded tracks in 1975 at the studio for an alleged 1975 East Berlin EP, Judy's In The Basement - The 914 Sessions. Janis Ian teamed up with Brooks Arthur for three albums recorded at 914 Sound, including 1975's number-one Between the Lines, containing her hit \\"At Seventeen\\". Between the Lines was the final project at 914 that Arthur worked on. The partners sold the studio in 1978, while the corporation (914 Sound Recording Studios, Inc.) formally dissolved in 1982.

(Archaeological excavations in the 1980s unearthed its remains). *14th century, first half: The current hall was built by Sir William de BaguleyAs a result, a recent low-rise apartment block across the road is called Sir William's Court. and possibly completed either by his son, John de Baguley, or more likely by his grandson and heir, Sir William Legh, entirely of timber with wattle and daub walls, probably the oldest timber great hall surviving in England: it used timbers of unusual size. *15th century: The north wing was built in timber, elements of which survive. It replaced previous tithe barns. *16th century: The west side timber-framed porch was added. *Late 17th century: The south wing was added, in brick, replacing a chamber block which was added to the aisled-hall before the early 14th century. *18th century: The north wing was rebuilt in brick. The south chamber block was replaced by a brick-built south wing. *19th century: The west side timber-framed porch was partially rebuilt. *Early 20th century: The hall was used as a farm building. *Circa World War II: The hall was also known in the area as Maher's Farm which grew and sold vegetables. *Circa 1960 and after: Its estate was built over, becoming Wythenshawe. The hall was abandoned, and its former grounds became covered with dense bramble and other wild vegetation, which was cleared out with local volunteer help. *1970s: Maintenance started; for a long time in and after the 1970s the hall was covered in a big corrugated iron shed while its timber was exposed and treated against woodworm and dry rot. *April 2013: The hall remains closed to the public; its grounds are kept tidy.

Sir William de Baguley's daughter, Isabel, married Sir John Legh of Booths, near Knutsford. Her son, Sir William Legh, succeeded and the estate remained in the possession of the Leghs until the latter part of the 17th century. The last male heir was Edward Legh who married Eleanor, daughter of William Tatton of Wythenshawe Hall. They had three daughters and Baguley was leased to the Viscounts Allen until 1749 when the estate was bought by Joseph Jackson of Rostherne, whose family married into the Leighs of West Hall, High Legh.Wythenshawe History Group: Baguley Hall Jackson left it in his will to the Revd Millington Massey from whom it was inherited by his daughter,London Gazette (1844) before being conveyed by the trustees of her marriage settlement to Thomas William Tatton, via his son Thomas Egerton Tatton to Robert Henry Grenville Tatton.University of Manchester Library: Tatton of Wythenshawe Muniments Bought by Manchester Corporation in 1926. Since 1968 the building has been owned by HM Government.The Ministry of Works initiated the 1971 to 1982 restoration program. The hall is currently under the guardianship of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The structure and grounds are maintained by Historic England. The hall is listed on the Buildings at Risk Register, rating its condition as \\"fair\\".

The C1QTNF5 gene secreted and membrane-linked to a protein which is strongly expressed in retinal pigment epithelium cells.  Function  The CTRP5 protein is a member of the C1q / tumor necrosis factor superfamily, which shows diverse functions including cell adhesion and as components of the basement membrane.  Clinical significance  A mutation in the C1QTNF5 gene causes late-onset retinal degeneration. More specifically, a single missense mutation (S163R) in the encoded C1QTNF5 protein causes the Late-onset retinal degeneration disease(L-ORD).  Structure  The structure of C1q and Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Protein 5 (C1QTNF5) which is also called CTRP5 has three essential domains. The first domain is a single peptide which is located in N-terminal, the second domain is a collage domain and the third domain is a globular complement 1q (gC1q) that exists in the C-terminal domain. The single mutation S163R is found in the gC1q domain which is the main reason for Late-onset retinal degeneration disease(L-ORD). C1QTNF5 is a part of the C1q family. However, there is a unique feature of the structure of C1QTNF5 that it does not own a Ca 2+ binding site as other members of the C1q family.  Crystal structure  Crystal structure of C1QTNF5 has been taken by Xiongying and Krzysztof and it has two characteristics. One is that the structure of C1QTNF5 seems not to have a Ca 2+ binding site in order to its stability. Also, it is necessary for the function of the members of the C1q family. Another feature is having an unusual sequence which is (F181, F182, G183, G184, W185, P186) that generate a hydrophobic field. In this area, S163 and F182 build H bond, However, the mutation S163 will make a disruption to the H bond.

History The Squadron formed on 15 May 1918. Equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, it supported the final offensives against the Turks in Palestine. The unit disbanded on 2 September 1919. On 10 October 1939, No. 145 Squadron was reformed, taking delivery of Hurricane fighters in March 1940. It operated over Dunkirk and in the Battle of Britain before re-equipping with Supermarine Spitfires in early 1941. From February 1942, it was based in the Middle East, then in Malta, and finally in northern Italy, before disbanding on 19 August 1945. Squadron Leader Wade, second from right, with 145 Squadron pilots at Triolo Airfield, Italy American fighter pilot Lance C. Wade, one of the leading Allied Aces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), was a Flight Commander and Squadron Leader of No. 145 Squadron. In spring of 1943 'C' flight of the squadron was the Polish Fighting Team. In March 1943, No. 145 Squadron pilots who came from the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Argentina, Trinidad, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and Poland were credited with 20 Axis aircraft destroyed, over one third of the total destroyed by the entire RAF in the MTO for that month. On 19 August 1945, the Squadron disbanded in northern Italy. No. 145 Squadron was reformed once more, as a fighter-bomber unit in Germany, on 1 March 1952. Initially flying de Havilland Vampires, it converted to de Havilland Venoms in 1954. The squadron was disbanded on 15 October 1957. The squadron number has been used on three subsequent occasions as a 'Shadow' designation for Operational Conversion Units. From 22 October 1958 to 1 June 1963 it was allocated to the Hawker Hunter equipped No 229 OCU at RAF Chivenor. The same day it was transferred to No 226 OCU at RAF Middleton St George, which was responsible for training English Electric Lightning pilots. No 226 moved to RAF Coltishall in April 1964 and retained the number as a shadow designation until re-numbered 65 Squadron on 1 September 1970. 145 Squadron RAF \\"C\\" Polish Fighting Team: In late 1942 Polish Air Force Staff Command requested RAF permission to send a group of specially chosen pilots to the North African theatre of operations to acquire experience in operating as a part of a tactical air force in preparation for future Allied landings on the European continent. Volunteers had to be experienced (with at least 30 operation missions completed) and some 70 volunteers were considered before 15 pilots were chosen for the operational tour of 3 months. Formed at Northolt on 5 February 1943 as the Polish Fighting Team, initial preparations for overseas service took place at RAF West Kirby, and the unit embarked on 24 February, arriving in North Africa on 13 March 1943. The team was initially attached as 'C' flight, to No. 145 Squadron RAF, (under ace S/L Lance Wade) equipped with the Spitfire Mk.V and operating from Bu Ghara, 150 miles west of Tripoli. Commencing operations on 18 March the unit gained an immediate reputation for combat effectiveness. The unit re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire Mark IX in late March. Flying Officer Mieczys≈Çaw Wyszkowski was the only casualty in the PFT, shot down and taken prisoner-of-war on 18 April. Following the surrender of the German Army in Africa on 13 May, the PFT was disbanded. Three pilots stayed on and became part of Desert Air Force units; Skalski became CO of No. 601 Squadron, Horbaczewski CO of No. 43 and Drecki a Flight Commander in No. 152.

The city belongs to the mesoregion of Zona da Mata and to the microregion of Muria√©. * Main Rivers: Fub√° and Muria√©  History  Brejo was its first name. The agriculture sector is pointed as one of the most successful of the region Zona da Mata. The city territory is located in a region of easy access due to the presence of Rio-Bahia highway, also called BR-116. The first village was set up on the margins of the Muria√© River. Around 1840, attracted by land fertility, the first explorers came to Mira√≠'s region. Finding land and good water, they spread the news and eventually other farmers arrived. At 1852, a group of farmers acquired part of the land belonging to the farm named Tr√™s Barras, in the place they built a chapel to Santo Ant√¥nio and around grew a village called Brejo. Later, the village became the District of Paz, with the name of Santo Ant√¥nio do Muria√©, belonging to Freguesia de Santa Rita de Meia Pataca. At 1883, the district was turned into Freguesia de Santo Ant√¥nio do Camapu√£. The name was changed to Mira√≠, which means \\"wet land\\" in Tupi, by 1895. The municipality was created in 1923, separating itself from Cataguases.  Attractions  The town presents as natural attractions countless waterfalls. The Carnival Parade is very traditional, attracting tourist from all over the country. In September the city host the Festival Samba and Botequim, a cultural event offering good music and regional cuisine, by the bus station. = Ataulfo Alves = Ataulfo Alves was the most famous person to be born in Mira√≠, he is known as one of the best samba compositor of the second half of the 20th century, there is a museum to his memory in the city.  Disasters  In January 2007, the city was victim of a flooding with catastrophic proportions after the collapse of a barrage belonging to the company Rio Pomba Cataguases, more than 2 billion liters of water mixed with mud and chemical waste used on the extraction of bauxite was dumped in the city causing its destruction and affecting the Muria√© River, hence destroying many cities on its way to the Atlantic Ocean. This was the second accident to happen in the region caused by this company. The damage to the environment was unmeasurable.

This protein is considered a constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane.  Function  The protein encoded by COX10 is an assembly factor essential to COX synthesis, participating in the first step of the mitochondrial heme A biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the farnesylation of the vinyl group at position C2 of protoheme (heme B) and converts it to heme O.  Clinical Significance  Mutations in the COX10 gene can result in numerous clinical phenotypes, from tubulopathy and leukodystrophy to Leigh syndrome to fatal infantile cardiomyopathy to a French Canadian form of Leigh Syndrome. A wide variety of symptoms encompassing the entire range of COX deficiency symptoms have been reported, including ataxia, hypotonia, ptosis, lactic acidosis, proximal tubulopathy, anemia, myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and leukodystrophy. In addition, this gene is disrupted in patients with CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A) duplication and with HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) deletion.

The \\"CPA3\\" gene expression has only been detected in mast cells and mast-cell-like lines, and CPA3 is located in secretory granules. CPA3 is one of 8-9 members of the A/B subfamily that includes the well-studied pancreatic enzymes carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1), carboxypeptidase A2 (CPA2), and carboxypeptidase B. This subfamily includes 6 carboxypeptidase A-like enzymes, numbered 1-6. The enzyme now called CPA3 was originally named mast cell carboxypeptidase A, and another protein was initially called CPA3. A gene nomenclature committee renamed mast cell carboxypeptidase A as CPA3, and the original CPA3 reported by Huang et al. became CPA4 to reflect the order of their discovery. Structure=Gene= The \\"CPA3\\" gene is a 32kb-gene located at chromosome 3q24, consisting of 11 exons. =Protein= CPA3 shares significant homology with the CPA subfamily of metalloprecarboxypeptidases and all the residues essential for the coordination of the Zn2+ active site, substrate peptide anchoring, and CP activity are preserved in the putative CPA3 protein. It resembles pancreatic CPA1 in cleaving C-terminal aromatic and aliphatic amino acid residues.CPA3 contains an N-terminal sequence of 16 amino acids and a pro-peptide between the NH2-terminal signal peptide sequence and COOH-terminal CP moiety.  Function  CPA3 has a pH optimum in the neutral to basic range. CPA3 functions together with endopeptidases secreted from mast cells such as chymases and tryptases to degrade proteins and peptides, including the apolipoprotein B component of LDL particles and angiotensin ‚Ö†. Upon mast cell activation and degranulation, CPA3, the chymases, and tryptases are released in complexes with heparin proteoglycan. The parasitic nematode Ascaris produces CPA3 inhibitors, which increase its survival during infection. This finding implies that CPA3 might be involved in host defense against certain parasites. CPA3 is also reported to have an important role in the protection towards snake venom toxins and vasoconstricting peptide endothelin 1(ET1). Clinical significance CPA3 provides protection from ET-1-induced damage, suggesting CPA3 could have a role in regulating sepsis. The involvement of CPA3 in autoimmune disease models makes it a potential diagnostic parameter of related diseases. The significantly increased concentration of CPA3 in drug- induced anaphylaxis also implies that CPA3 could serve as a diagnostic parameter and detection of it could improve the forensic identification. A new mast cell subtype reported to appear in mucosa is implicated in allergic inflammation and these mast cells have high levels of CPA3. The highly upregulated transcript of CPA3 is readily detected in luminal brushings and biopsies, making it a useful biomarker of allergic inflammation.

Castleman-Citizen ‚Äì After the Civil War, Castleman studied law and graduated from University of Louisville in 1868. Known as Father of Louisville Park System, he was responsible for Cherokee, Shawnee, Iroquois, and Central parks. Castleman also organized and was president of American Saddle Horse Assn., 1892. Appointed Adjutant General by both governors Knott and Beckham.\\"Kentucky Historical Society, Historical Marker Database; search for marker number 1629. Castleman served as a Confederate officer during the American Civil War, a U.S. Army officer in charge of the Louisville Legion, and fought in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He founded the American Saddlebred Horse Association and served as its president for almost 25 years. The horse which Castleman rides on the statue was based on his beloved mare, Carolina. His most familiar appearance in Louisville, either at the head of the Louisville Legion or pursuant of his labors as president of the Board of Park Commissioners, was on the back of a five-gaited horse. This monument and the John Hunt Morgan Memorial in Lexington, Kentucky are the only Civil War monuments in Kentucky with equestrians. Due to his work in developing Louisville's park system, including serving as president of the Louisville Board of Park Commissioners, Castleman became known as the father of the Louisville Park System. He helped create multiple parks, donated land for Cherokee Park, and sold half of his estate to develop Tyler Park. It was not until six years after Castleman's death that the parks became segregated, and nineteen black leaders in Louisville, including William Warley, leader of the Louisville NAACP, signed a letter to the Courier-Journal in 1924 that Castleman ‚Äústeadfastly refused to allow any kind of racial segregation in the parks of the city‚Äù while he was on the park board. On the night of August 12‚Äì13, 2017, the statue and the historical marker near it were defaced with orange paint. The statue was defaced again in February 2018 and a third time in April 2018. At the request of Mayor Greg Fischer, Louisville's Commission on Public Art created the Public Arts and Monuments Advisory Committee which held forums to develop recommendations for handling public artworks that \\"honored bigotry, racism and/or slavery.\\" The committee made public a draft of their report in June 2018, stating that \\"A bronze figure towering above a city street gives the impression that the city celebrates the entire life of the figure depicted...\\" and \\"Removal is the best option when it is no longer possible to reconcile the monument‚Äôs message with the values of the city.\\" The final report was delivered on June 30, 2018, with Mayor Fischer announcing on August 8 that \\"...the city will be moving the Castleman & [ George D. Prentice ] statues. My decision is based on the findings of our Public Art & Monuments Advisory Committee ‚Äî Louisville must not maintain statues that serve as validating symbols for racist or bigoted ideology.\\" In order to remove the statue, the mayor's office is required to first obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the Cherokee Triangle Architectural Review Committee. This is because the statue is located in the Cherokee Triangle Preservation District. However, while convening on the issue on January 23, 2019, the committee arrived at a split vote. On May 9, 2019, the Metro Louisville Landmark Commission ruled that the monument may be removed. As of June 2019, the movement of the statue has been delayed following suit by several residents, historians, a civil rights activist and the non for profit Friends of Louisville Public Art. Filed by Lawyer Stephen Porter who represents the group in district court, the appeal makes note of various conflicts of interest in the mayor's review board panel as well as procedural errors that allowed for \\"the erroneous decision of the Landmarks Commission to allow the removal of the statue of Castleman, once a U.S. Army General, and his American Saddlebred horse Carolina\\" As of June 2020, the statue has been removed pending cleaning and relocation to Castleman's burial site in Cave Hill Cemetery.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara. One of the largest single neighborhoods in Europe, consists of several sub-neighborhoods (Staro & Novo Mirijevo, Mirijevo II-IV, etc.)  Location and geography  Mirijevo is located 11 kilometers east of downtown Belgrade, on the eastern outskirts of Belgrade's urban zone. It extends into the neighborhoods of ƒÜalije on the north, Zvezdara on the west and Mali Mokri Lug (Zeleno Brdo) on the south. The neighborhood developed in the valley of Mirijevski potok (creek which is a right tributary to the Danube, at the neighborhood of Rospi ƒÜuprija), between the Zvezdara hill in the west (253 meters), Orlovica hill (274 meters, read as Orlovitsa; on some city maps given as Orlovaƒça) in the north-east and Stojƒçino hill (274 meters) in the south, so the neighborhood today mostly develops in the south-east, the only remaining unurbanized part of the valley. The territory of Mirijevo was a mass wasting area. During the rapid construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, since majority of the buildings were highrise, the terrain was systematically improved. As a result, the movement of the land is today completely halted and Mirijevo is considered as the most successful project of fixing the mass wasting problem in Belgrade.  History and population  In the 19th and early 20th century, the area of modern Bulbulder neighborhood in Zvezdara consisted of yards and gardens. Bulgarian settlers were cultivating vegetables, which was then directly sold on the wooden benches in front of the gardens. The settlement changed after the city cemetery was transferred from Ta≈°majdan to the northern section of the Bulbulder, as the Belgrade New Cemetery, in the 1886-1927 period. The creek of Bulbuderski potok was channeled and the construction of the houses began while the gardeners were transferred to Mirijevo. Mirijevo used to be a separate village, outside Belgrade's urban zone, but as Belgrade developed, by the early 1970s Mirijevo became part of the city's urban area and lost separate status after 1971, becoming local community (mesna zajednica, sub-municipal administrative unit) within Belgrade city proper (u≈æa teritorija grada). Massive population growth ensued. In 2011 population of the settlement was 41,407.  Municipality movement  Movement which gained momentum during the ongoing protest from the local population against construction of the power transformer in the center of the neighborhood from the late 1990s. However, the idea is on hiatus at the moment.Politika, October 20, 2007, p.27  Sub- neighborhoods = Staro Mirijevo = Staro Mirijevo (Old Mirijevo) is the oldest part of the neighborhood, area of the former village of Mirijevo and it constitutes a separate local community. It occupies the northern section of the entire neighborhood, on the both sides of Mirijevski Potok, bordering ƒÜalije on the north, Zvezdara on the west, Orlovsko Naselje on the north-east, Mirijevo II on the south and Mirijevo III on the south-east. Area is mostly made from individual residential houses, with a population of 7,604 by the 2002 census (including Orlovsko Naselje) and 13,318 in 2011. Central streets are Jovanke Radakoviƒá and Vitezova Karaƒëorƒëeve zvezde. Orthodox church of the Saint Prophet Elias is in the center of the neighborhood. = Novo Mirijevo = Novo Mirijevo (New Mirijevo) is a joint name for the local community with a population of 28,986 by the 2002 census and 28,089 in 2011. It consists of Mirijevo II, III and IV. = Mirijevo II = Central part of the neighborhood, characterized by the large residential buildings. It borders Staro Mirijevo on the north, Mirijevo III on the east and extends into Mali Mokri Lug on the south-west. Central street, going through the center of the neighborhood is Mirijevski venac while the southern border is marked by the parallel Matice srpske street. In April 2008 grassy area between the Mirijevski venac and Radivoja Markoviƒáa streets was projected as the future and first real park in the neighborhood.Politika, April 18, 2008, p.28 Park will consist of the linden trees and the existing playgrounds and bocce court will be renovated and become part of the park. = Mirijevo III = Eastern part of the neighborhood, entirely residential. Bounded by the streets of Matice srpske on the west and Koste Naƒëa on the east, it borders Mirijevo II on the west and Mirijevo IV on the south-east. A new Health Center, under construction since the 1990s was finally finished in 2009, while a new kindergarten was also completed in 2008. = Mirijevo IV = The latest, south-eastern extension of the neighborhood. From Koste Nadja Street and along Samuel Beckett and Mikhail Bulgakov Streets, this is the largest of the Mirijevo neighborhoods. One of the largest schools in Belgrade and Serbia, Pavle Savic Elementary School is also located there. The newest parts of the neighborhood extend along the 1,1 kilometer long road connecting Mirijevo to the Smederevski put, a road connecting Belgrade and Smederevo via Belgrade's suburb of Grocka. The road was opened in 2007 and shortened the trip from suburbs in Grocka direction (like Kaluƒëerica) for 11 kilometers. For over a 20 years a beltway circumventing central part of Mirijevo is planned and the construction should began in 2008. It will bypass the neighborhood from Mirijevo IV, through the unurbanized eastern side to the beginning of the Mirijevo boulevard in the southern part of the neighborhood of ƒÜalije, north of Mirijevo itself.Politika, January 18, 2007, p.26 = Orlovsko Naselje = Orlovsko Naselje (Serbian Cyrillic: –û—Ä–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ—ô–µ) is the north-eastern extension of Mirijevo. It is mostly an informal settlement of the Romani people. The main street in the settlement is Orlovska, meaning \\"eagle street\\" (thus the neighborhood is called \\"eagle settlement\\") as it leads into the foothills of the neighboring Orlovaƒça hill (\\"eagle hill\\"). The settlement was established in 1815. In 1968-1969, the inhabitants were partially resettled across the other parts of the city in the newly built apartments. In the early 2000s, various alleys of the Orlovska street were named after people who were connected to Romani people, either by their origin or through their work: Django Reinhardt, Yul Brynner, Rabindranath Tagore, Jovan Janiƒáijeviƒá Burdu≈°, etc. Population of the settlement is estimated to 900Politika, May 6, 2008, p.26-1,000. 250px = ≈†oferski Raj = Small settlement developed in the mid 2000s, along the Ljubi≈°e Miodragoviƒáa street, as the southernmost extension of Mirijevo. As majority of the original inhabitants were truck or bus drivers, the settlement is colloquially named ≈†oferski Raj (Chauffeur‚Äôs Paradise). It developed without building permits and lacks the basic communal infrastructure like street lights, public transportation, grocery shops, proper power grid, etc.  Transportation = Mirijevo Boulevard = Mirijevo was badly connected to the rest of the city, mostly through the narrow streets in Zvezdara (Milana Rakiƒáa, Mite Ru≈æiƒáa) bringing heavy traffic to the Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. In the late 1990s, the idea of constructing the Mirijevo Boulevard (), in the north-to-south direction was proposed, which would connect Mirijevo to the Vi≈°njiƒçka street on the north, thus connecting it to the Rospi ƒÜuprija, Karaburma, Bogoslovija and further with the downtown. Due to the property ownership problems, the construction dragged for years. Final phase began on 7 February 2011 and was finished in November. It included the construction of the final of the boulevard, intersections with the Mirijevo's cross streets, sidewalks, city lights and the long underground concrete collector which conducted the stream of Mirijevski potok underground.

Salisbury was commissioned in 1699 under her first commander, Captain Richard Lestock. The following year she joined Admiral George Rooke's fleet in the Baltic, and remained with Rooke off Dunkirk in 1701. Lestock was succeeded by Captain Richard Cotton, but while off Orford Ness on 10 April 1703 she encountered and was attacked by a squadron consisting of four French warships, including the Adroit, and three privateers. After an engagement which left 17 killed and 34 wounded, Salisbury was taken by the French. She served with the French under the name Salisbury, and for a time was part of Claude de Forbin's squadron. On 1 May 1707, Salisbury very nearly fell back into English hands. Salisbury was part of the Dunkirk Squadron that attacked the English convoy commanded by Baron Wylde, during the Action of 2 May 1707. Captain George Clements lost his life in defence of HMS Hampton Court, but not before his crew so disabled Salisbury that she was left for a wreck, later recovered by the French who could not fit her out in time for their next warring exploit.Wm.

On 8 May 1739 Preston was ordered to be taken to pieces and rebuilt at Plymouth according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment, and was relaunched on 18 September 1742. From 1745 she was assigned to the Royal Navy's East Indies squadron which was based in the Dutch-held port of Trincomalee, Ceylon. In September 1748 she was declared unseaworthy and converted into a hulk.

Biography Harris is fluent in reading and writing music and switched from her original instrument, the oboe, to the dulcimer in the mid-1970s. In making that switch, she became one of the foremost performers on that folk instrument, though at the time it seemed just a matter of expediency. She was married to John Kirkpatrick, a prominent melodeon virtuoso in England, was pregnant with their first son, and found herself unable to maintain the breath control needed to play the oboe. She performed on both instruments with the Albion Country Band on their debut album Battle of the Field (1976), and also recorded and performed as one half of a duet with Kirkpatrick. Harris has also performed with Richard and Linda Thompson, and has been a composer for the BBC on various broadcast plays, as well as for live theatre. She is also a singer and has written music for choral groups. More recently, in 2008 she was leader of the \\"Wild Angels Community Choir\\" in Welshpool, Powys, Wales. Following the World Dulcimer Congress held in Malvern, Worcestershire in 2015, Harris formed the English Dulcimer Duo with Lisa Warburton.

Background On June 26, 1917, Local 800 of the Industrial Workers of the World (or IWW, a labor union), struck the Phelps Dodge Corporation and other mining companies in the town of Bisbee, Arizona. Nearly 3,000 miners (about 38% of the town's total population) walked out. The strike was a peaceful one. However, Walter S. Douglas, the president of Phelps Dodge, was determined to break the strike.Foner, Philip S. History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 7: Labor and World War I, 1914‚Äì1918.

Jensen, Vernon H. Heritage of Conflict: Labor Relations in the Nonferrous Metals Industry up to 1930. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1950. On July 11, Douglas and other Phelps Dodge corporate executives met with Cochise County Sheriff Harry Wheeler to conspire to seize, by force of arms, all the striking workers, forcibly transport (deport) them several hundred miles away from Bisbee, and abandon them in another desert town without food, clothing or funds. To this end, Sheriff Wheeler recruited and deputized 2,200 men from Bisbee and the nearby town of Douglas to act as a posse. Phelps Dodge officials also met with executives of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, who agreed to provide rail transportation for any deportees. Phelps Dodge and the other employers provided Sheriff Wheeler with a list of all the men on strike, as well as suspected IWW sympathizers. At 6:30 a.m. on the morning of July 12, the 2,200 deputies moved through town and arrested every man on their list as well as any man who refused to work in the mines. About 2,000 men were seized and taken by armed guards to a baseball stadium two miles away. Several hundred men were freed after being permitted to denounce the IWW. At 11:00 a.m., 23 cattle cars belonging to the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad arrived in Bisbee, and the remaining 1,286 arrestees were forced at gunpoint to board the train. The detainees were transported for 16 h through the desert without food or water. They were unloaded at Hermanas, New Mexico without money or transportation at 3:00 a.m. on July 13 and told not to return to Bisbee or they would suffer physical harm. The Luna County sheriff and New Mexico Governor Washington E. Lindsey contacted President Woodrow Wilson for assistance. Wilson ordered US Army troops to escort the men to Columbus, New Mexico. The deportees were housed in tents meant for Mexican refugees who had fled across the border to escape the Army's Pancho Villa Expedition. The men were allowed to stay in the camp until September 17, 1917. Sheriff Wheeler established armed guards at all entrances to Bisbee and Douglas. Any citizen seeking to exit or enter the town over the next several months had to have a \\"passport\\" issued by Wheeler. Any adult male in town who was not known to the sheriff's men was brought before a secret sheriff's kangaroo court. Hundreds of citizens were tried, and most of them deported and threatened with lynching if they returned. The deported citizens of Bisbee pleaded with President Wilson for law enforcement assistance in returning to their homes. In October 1917, Wilson appointed a commission of five individuals, led by Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson (with assistance from Assistant Secretary of Labor Felix Frankfurter), to investigate labor disputes in Arizona. The commission heard testimony during the first five days of November 1917. In its final report, issued on November 6, 1917, the commission declared the deportations \\"wholly illegal and without authority in law, either State or Federal.\\"Report on the Bisbee Deportations. Made by the President's Mediation Commission to the President of the United States. Bisbee, Arizona. November 6, 1917. On May 15, 1918, the U.S. Department of Justice ordered the arrest of 21 mining company executives and several Bisbee and Cochise County elected leaders and law enforcement officers. The indictment contained four counts. Three counts alleged conspiracy to violate ¬ß19 of the United States Criminal Code. A fourth count was dropped before trial. The indictments did not reference any federal law as there was no law in existence at the time made kidnapping (or abduction, felonious or unlawful restraint, or felonious or unlawful imprisonment) a crime. Thus, the government was forced to rely on a dubious claim of an implied federal power in order to prosecute Wheeler and the others. The defense, led by a Phelps Dodge corporate attorney (provided pro bono), filed a pre-trial motion in a federal district court to release the 21 men on the grounds that no federal laws had been violated. In Wheeler v. United States, 254 Fed. Rep. 611 (1919), the district court threw out the indictments on the grounds that, absent specific statutory authorization, the Constitution did not grant the United States the authority to punish the alleged illegal acts.Wheeler v. United States, 254 Fed. Rep. 611 (1919). The Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court. W. C. Herron, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney and brother-in-law of former President William Howard Taft, argued the case for the United States. Former Associate Justice and future Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes led the team which argued the case for Phelps Dodge. Decision Chief Justice Edward Douglass White wrote the opinion for the 8-1 majority, in which the judgment of the district court was affirmed. Associate Justice John Hessin Clarke dissented, but wrote no opinion. White opened the majority's decision by reviewing at length the four indictments and briefly describing the ruling of the federal district court. Then, in a section widely quoted in American jurisprudence for the next century, White described the fundamental right which was at issue: :In all the States from the beginning down to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation the citizens thereof possessed the fundamental right, inherent in citizens of all free governments, peacefully to dwell within the limits of their respective States, to move at will from place to place therein, and to have free ingress thereto and egress therefrom, with a consequent authority in the States to forbid and punish violations of this fundamental right.United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, citing Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823) and . White next outlined the history of the \\"privileges and immunities\\" clause of Article IV, Sec. 2, of the Constitution. In the space of less than one sentence, White came to the landmark conclusion that only the states had enforcement authority over the \\"privileges and immunities\\" mentioned in Article IV. The \\"privileges and immunity\\" clause, White wrote, was a linear descendant of a similar if limited clause in the Articles of Confederation. \\"[The] Constitution plainly intended to preserve and enforce the limitation...\\" White reasoned, and thus \\"the continued possession by the States of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress and egress, cannot be denied.\\"Wheeler, 254 U.S. at 282, citing . The principle of comity enshrined in Art. IV, Sec. 2, is one of the most fundamental principles in the Constitution, White claimed. It was, he asserted, the very basis for the Union. The right encompassed not only travel between the separate states but also movement within a state, but while the Constitution fused these two rights into one, it reserved exclusively to the states the power to enforce these rights, except when a state violated the rule of comity.Wheeler, 254 U.S. at 283. Relying exclusively on the Slaughter-House Cases,. and United States v. Harris, White noted that Art. IV, Sec. 2, may be invoked solely when a state actor is involved. White distinguished Crandall v. Nevada,. by noting that that decision had involved state action.Wheeler, 254 U.S. at 283-284. Aftermath In United States v. Wheeler, the majority never discussed whether Sheriff Wheeler had acted in his capacity as a state actor. It remains unclear whether the government even raised the issue at trial or on appeal.Pratt, Walter F. The Supreme Court Under Edward Douglass White, 1910‚Äì1921. Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1999. United States v. Wheeler identified a major omission in federal criminal law (the lack of a federal kidnapping statute), but it would take a major national tragedy to rectify the problem. In most common law jurisdictions, kidnappingKidnapping includes abduction, felonious or unlawful imprisonment, and felonious or unlawful restraint. had been outlawed by the courts, not by statute, but the Supreme Court had held in United States v. Hudson and Goodwin that the Constitution prohibited common law crimes.United States v. Hudson and Goodwin, 11 U.S. 32 (1812). It was only after the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, which ended in the death of 21-month-old Charles Lindbergh, Jr., that Congress passed the Federal Kidnapping Act, which prohibited kidnapping.Lippman, Matthew R. Contemporary Criminal Law: Concepts, Cases, and Controversies. 1st ed. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE Publications, 2006. Several of the deported citizens brought civil actions against Wheeler, Douglas and the others. But in State v. Wootton, Crim. No. 2685 (Cochise County, Ariz. September 13, 1919), a jury refused to find in favor of the complainants and give them relief. Defendant Wootton argued that the IWW members were such a threat to public safety that necessity demanded their removal. The jury agreed, making this one of the rare times in American law in which the necessity defense was successfully used. After this failure at law, nearly all the remaining civil suits were dropped (although a handful were settled for small sums of money).\\"Comment: The Law of Necessity as Applied in the Bisbee Deportation Case.\\" Arizona Law Review. 3:264 (1961).Greenawalt, Kent. Conflicts of Law and Morality. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. Few, if any, of the deported citizens ever returned to Bisbee. Assessment United States v. Wheeler did not have a direct major impact on American constitutional law. The case was only one of a long line of decisions which extended as far back as the circuit court ruling in Corfield v. Coryell, and included the Supreme Court decisions in Paul v. Virginia,. Ward v. Maryland,. the Slaughter-House Cases and United States v. Harris. All the decisions rejected federal protection of important constitutional rights. Still, although Wheeler stood firmly in the middle of an established stream of constitutional law, the Supreme Court itself began rejecting the rationales contained in Wheeler a few years later. Finally, in United States v. Guest,United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 759 n.16 (1966). the Supreme Court overruled Chief Justice White's conclusion that the federal government could protect the right to travel only against state infringement.Duster, Michael J. \\"Criminal Justice System Reform Symposium: Note: Out of Sight, Out of Mind: State Attempts to Banish Sex Offenders.\\" Drake Law Review. 53:711 (Spring 2005). Indirectly, however, United States v. Wheeler had a much larger impact. For many years, the roots of the Constitution's \\"privileges and immunities\\" clause had not been clearly determined. In 1823, the circuit court in Corfield had provided a list of the rights (some fundamental, some not) that the clause could cover.Wadley, James B. \\"Indian Citizenship and the Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the United States Constitution: An Alternative to the Problems of the Full Faith and Credit and Comity?\\" Southern Illinois University Law Journal. 31:31 (Fall 2006).Dunlap, Frank L. \\"Constitutional Law: Power of States to Prevent Entry of Paupers from Other States.\\" California Law Review. 26:5 (July 1938). The Wheeler court dramatically changed this. By reasoning that the clause derived from Article IV of the Articles of Confederation, the decision suggested a narrower set of rights than those enumerated in Corfield, but also more clearly defined those rights as absolutely fundamental. =The right to travel and what that implies= Among the rights specifically mentioned in United States v. Wheeler is the right to travel. The right to travel had been mentioned in Corfield and recognized as a fundamental right. But the Wheeler court was the first to locate the right in the privileges and immunities clause, providing the right with a specific guarantee of constitutional protection.Foscarinis, Maria. \\"Downward Spiral: Homelessness and Its Criminalization.\\" Yale Law & Policy Review. 14:1 (1996). Chief Justice White's statement of the right to travel (quoted above) is frequently cited by courts even in the early 21st century and remains the classic formulation of the right to travel.Siebert, Kevin C. \\"Note: Nocturnal Juvenile Curfew Ordinances: The Fifth Circuit 'Narrowly Tailors' A Dallas Ordinance, But Will Similar Ordinances Encounter the Same Interpretation?\\" Washington University Law Quarterly. 73:1711 (1995).Conner, Toni L. \\"Juvenile Curfews: Political Pandering at the Expense of a Fundamental Right.\\" West Virginia Law Review. 109:459 (Winter 2007).Trollinger, Tona. \\"The Juvenile Curfew: Unconstitutional Imprisonment.\\" William & Mary Bill of Rights Journal. 4:949 (Summer 1996). The Supreme Court's rejection of Wheeler's state actor rationale but acceptance of its strong defense of the right to travel led to a number of additional court decisions and the establishment of a new constitutional test. In Kent v. Dulles, the Court held that the federal government may not restrict the right to travel without due process. Six years later, the Court struck down a federal ban restricting travel by communists.. But the court struggled to find a way to protect legitimate government interests (such as national security) in light of these decisions. Just a year after Aptheker, the Supreme Court fashioned the rational relationship test for constitutionality in Zemel v.

The Wheeler Court's establishment of a strong constitutional right to travel has also had far- reaching and unintended effects. For example, the Supreme Court overturned state prohibitions on welfare payments to individuals who had not resided within the jurisdiction for at least one year as an impermissible burden on the right to travel.. The Court has used Wheeler to strike down one-year residency requirements for voting in state elections,. one-year waiting periods before receiving state-provided medical care,. civil service preferences for state veterans,. and higher fishing and hunting license fees for out-of-state residents..Porter, Andrew C. \\"Comment: Toward a Constitutional Analysis of the Right to Intrastate Travel.\\" Northwestern University Law Review. 86:820 (1992).Zubler, Todd. \\"The Right to Migrate and Welfare Reform: Time for Shapiro v. Thompson to Take A Hike.\\" Valparaiso University Law Review. 31:893 (Summer 1997). The Wheeler decision may yet have even farther-reaching implications. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that freedom of movement is closely related to freedom of association and to freedom of expression. Strong constitutional protection for the right to travel may have significant implications for state attempts to limit abortion rights, ban or refuse to recognize same-sex marriage, and enact anti-crime or consumer protection laws. Wheeler may even undermine current Court-fashioned concepts of federalism.Simon, Harry. \\"Towns Without Pity: A Constitutional and Historical Analysis of Official Efforts to Drive Homeless Persons From American Cities.\\" Tulane Law Review. 66:631 (March 1992).Kreimer, Seth F. \\"The Law of Choice and Choice of Law: Abortion, the Right to Travel, and Extraterritorial Regulation in American Federalism.\\" New York University Law Review. 67:451 (June 1992).Rosen, Mark D. \\"Extraterritoriality and Political Heterogeneity in American Federalism.\\" University of Pennsylvania Law Review. 150:855 (January 2002).Kreimer, Seth F. \\"Territoriality and Moral Dissensus: Thoughts on Abortion, Slavery, Gay Marriage and Family Values.\\" Bridgeport Law Review/Quinnipiac Law Review. 16:161 (Spring/Summer 1996).Hemmens, Craig and Bennett, Katherine. \\"Out in the Street: Juvenile Crime, Juvenile Curfews, and the Constitution.\\" Gonzaga Law Review. 34:267 (1998/1999).

Like other arthrodires such as Coccosteus and the giant Dunkleosteus it had sharp, bony plates in its mouth which formed a turtle-like beak for cutting prey to pieces. Rolfosteus's most unusual feature was its highly elongated snout, which may have been used to enhance its sense of smell, as well as increase its hydrodynamic streamlining.
