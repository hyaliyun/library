Ephrin A5 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein of the ephrin-A subclass of ephrin ligands that binds to the EphA subclass of Eph receptors. Ephrin A5 has also been shown to bind to the EphB2 receptor.  Reverse signaling in growth cone survival  \\"Reverse\\" signaling is one unique property of ephrin ligands that allows for the transmission of an intracellular signal in ephrin-expressing cells that is distinct from the signal transmitted in Eph receptor-expressing cells. Although the mechanism of \\"reverse\\" signaling by ephrin-As is not well understood, it is relatively surprising considering that ephrin-A ligands are attached to the cell membrane solely by a GPI linkage and unlike ephrin-Bs, lack a potential intracellular signaling domain. Nonetheless, certain ephrin-A ligands are known to initiate reverse signaling cascades like ephrin A5, which has been shown to stimulate the spreading of growth cones in cultures of mouse spinal motor neurons. Reverse signaling by ephrin A5 was demonstrated to be GPI-dependent as the elimination of all GPI linkages by the application of a phosphatidlyinositol- specific phospholipase C abolished the positive effects of ephrin A5 on growth cone spreading. Additionally, EphA receptors were shown to exert opposite effects on motor neuron growth cones by reducing growth cone size.  Formation of the retinotopic map  This finding that ephrin A5 promotes growth cone survival that is opposite of EphA signaling and mediated directly by ephrin A5 reverse signaling has important implications for axon guidance as it provides a mechanism by which migrating axons expressing EphAs would preferentially avoid ephrin A5 expressing cells and possibly migrate towards cells with lower expression of ephrin A5. This mechanism is in fact the same one that mediates the guidance of retinal ganglion cells to distinct regions in the superior colliculus during the formation of the retinotopic map. High ephrin A5 expression on cells in the posterior region of the SC bind to EphAs expressed in RGCs migrating from the temporal retina, inducing growth cone collapse and repelling these RGCs away from the posterior SC towards a region of low ephrin A5 expression in the anterior SC.

Display advertising campaigns are sold on a Cost Per Impression model. Use Leafly has three primary functions: Strain explorer Patients and consumers use Leafly to search for cannabis strains according to medical use, such as anxiety or nausea, and desired effects, like euphoria or creativity. Relevant strains are then presented in a format similar to the periodic table. The table is color coded to identify whether the strain is sativa, indica, or a hybrid of both. Dispensary locator Patients can use their zip codes or city and state names to search for dispensaries, which are then displayed on a map of the area. The dispensary profiles include menus, reviews, photos, and store locations. Reviews Leafly users can write reviews of strains and products they have tried or dispensaries they have visited. For dispensaries and products, reviews consist of a brief comment section and a star rating system that is based on medication, service, and atmosphere. Strain reviews include desirable effects, attributes, and summary information. Mobile access Leafly has mobile applications for iOS and Android devices.

It is a triple chain silicate (or inosilicate) along with clinojimthompsonite and chesterite. They were described in 1977 by Burham and Veblen. They attracted great mineralogical attention because they were the first examples of new chain silicate structures among a large group known as biopyriboles whose name is derived from the words biotite, pyroxene, and amphiboles. James B. Thompson, Jr. postulated the existence of the new biopyroles in 1970. The theory proved correct when jimthompsonite, clinojimthompsonite and chesterite were discovered in the Carlton Quarry in Windsor County, Vermont in 1977. The new minerals are found intergrown with the amphiboles anthophyllite and cummingtonite in sprays up to 5 cm long. They are all colorless to pale pinkish-brown and transparent. As for pyroxene and amphiboles, the type of chain structure dictates the angle between the two distinctive cleavages. The cleavages of jimthompsonite are at 142 degrees and 38 degrees, and 135 degrees and 45 for chesterite; compared to the cleavage angles of pyroxene at about 94 degrees and 86 degrees and amphibole about 124 and 56 degrees. Composition The chemical formula of jimthompsonite is (Mg,Fe++)5Si6O16(OH)2. Veblen and Durham determined the percentages of jimthompsonite as follows: * Magnesium 14.71% Mg 24.40% MgO * Iron 11.27% Fe 14.50% FeO * Silicon 27.20% Si 58.20% SiO2 * Hydrogen 0.33% H 2.91% H2O * Oxygen 46.49% O Some of the other characteristics of jimthompsonite are that it has an orthorhombic crystal system dipyramidal with H-M symbol (2/m 2/m 2/m) and space group: Pbca. It has a perfect cleavage, its colorless to pink brown with a density of 3.03 g/cm3 and hardness of 2-2.5 gypsum. It has a white streak and silky-pearly luster. Origin It is found in the Carleton talc quarry, near Chester, Windsor County, Vermont, US. The name triple chain silicate comes from a wide complex chain structure as silicon being the most dominant element in its composition. It was named for James Burleigh Thompson, Jr. (born 1921), petrologist of Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. References Further reading * Clements, R.; Robinson D.

Based on David Karsner's biography of the same name, it tells the story of the rise and fall of Horace Tabor (renamed Yates Martin), a silver tycoon in 19th century Colorado.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Silver Dollar A copy is preserved in the Library of Congress.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress page 166 c.1978 by The American Film Institute Plot Kansas farmer Yates Martin (Edward G. Robinson ) uproots his uncomplaining wife Sarah (Aline MacMahon) and baby son to 1876 Colorado in search of gold. He buys a claim, then immediately abandons it when two prospectors tell him of a strike in Leadville. Taking Sarah's prudent advice, he sets up a store there. To her dismay, however, he stakes miners in return for partnerships in their diggings. Just as the Martins run out of money and decide to return to Kansas, prospectors Rische and Hook show up with the news that they have struck it rich, not with gold but with silver, and Yates has a third share of it. Yates spends his new-found riches with great abandon, purchasing, among other things, a claim from a seemingly downtrodden miner for $50,000, over his suspicious wife's objections. He is asked to run for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado. When his foreman informs him that the claim he bought is worthless, Yates tells him to keep on digging, at least until the election is over, so that he will not look like a fool. As it turns out, not only does he win the election, the claim yields a lode even richer than his first. Yates decides to build Denver an opulent opera house. As he is inspecting its construction, he meets the alluring Lily Owens (Bebe Daniels), who becomes his mistress. At the grand opening of the opera house, Yates' guest of honor is none other than General Ulysses S. Grant. Yates sets his sights higher, using his money to take the vacated seat of a U.S. senator. He divorces a heartbroken Sarah and marries Lily in Washington, DC, with the President as a wedding guest. However, when the president decides to put the country on the gold standard, the price of silver plummets, and Yates loses everything except the Matchless mine, which is not worth working at the current price. He declines Sarah's offer of money. A friend obtains the post of postmaster of Denver for him, but Yates collapses and dies penniless. Cast * Edward G.

Broadbent‚Äôs interest in tattooing began at the age of fourteen, when, while working as a nanny in Atlantic City, she met Jack Redcloud on the boardwalk. Redcloud was covered in tattoos, which fascinated Broadbent. This fascination would lead Redcloud to introduce Broadbent to his tattoo artist, Charlie Wagner. In 1927 Wagner, alongside several other tattoo artists, including Tony Rhineagear, Joe Van Hart and Red Gibbons, tattooed a bodysuit of over 565 tattoos on Broadbent. Charlie Wagner was friends with the circus man Clyde Ingalls. When Ingalls discovered Broadbent‚Äôs passion for tattooing, he offered her a position at the circus. In the same year, Broadbent began exhibiting her art with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. While working at the circus, Broadbent also trained as a steer rider who would perform with circus performer Tom Mix. Later in Broadbent‚Äôs career, she learned how to ride horses and mules.Betty Broadbent--Tattooed Beauty http://thehumanmarvels.com/?p=148 Broadbent‚Äôs tattoos varied in theme. On Broadbent‚Äôs back, she had a tattoo of the Madonna and child. The art on her lower limbs included a tattoo of Charles Lindbergh on her right leg and a tattoo of Pancho Villa on her left.

She spent time working for independent circuses in both New Zealand and Australia. After her return home to the United States, and until her retirement in 1967, she continued to perform and travel with a sideshow. Broadbent is regarded as the most photographed tattooed lady of the 20th century. In 1981, she was the first person to be inducted into the Tattoo Hall of Fame.

There are two versions of the fabliau: one by Guerin and one anonymous. Summary The story begins when a rich earl marries his daughter off to a \\"young peasant\\" and deems him a knight. The knight abandons the code of chivalry and lazes around for the first ten years of the marriage. When his wife, tired of his demeaning attitude and lazy nature, speaks of the greatness of the knights in her family, the husband decides to prove himself a worthy knight. He dresses in armor and goes into the forest on horseback. Once in the forest, he hangs his shield on the lowest branch of a tree and beats it until it looks as if it endured a great battle. The knight returns to his wife, shows her his bruised armor, and gloats about his victories. After a few trips into the forest, the wife begins to wonder why the knight himself is unscathed while his armor is in shambles. The next day, she suggests he take servants with him. When he refuses, the lady dresses in a full body suit of armor and follows him into the forest. When she sees him beating his own shield, she steps into sight and threatens to kill him for his dishonor to chivalry. The knight does not recognize his wife's voice. He begs for \\"pity\\" and offers to do anything to avoid conflict. His wife, disguised as a mighty knight, gives him the option of jousting her, in which he will surely die, or kissing her arse. Out of cowardice, the knight chooses to kiss her arse. She hops off her horse and pulls down her pants. While the knight should have recognized her female genitalia, he remarks that she has a long arse. Before she leaves, she tells him, \\"I'm B√©rangier of the Long Ass, Who puts shame to the chickenhearted.\\" The wife returns home and sleeps with a valiant knight. When her husband arrives from the forest, he rebukes her. However, that was his last demeaning remark to her. She tells him she met B√©rangier and learned of her husband's cowardice. To protect his own name, the knight is forced to succumb to his wife's wishes. Her cleverness leads her to do as she pleased for the rest of her life, and her husband lives in shame.Eichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, & Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux.

Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print. Whereas the woman previously had ‚Äú[caught] the brunt of [her husband‚Äôs] bragging and insults,‚Äù seeing the ‚Äúabsolute farce‚Äù of his claims in the forest inspires her to become a ‚Äúhard, driving force that will not only teach him a lesson but also will annihilate him in position as leader in the household‚Äù.Eichmann, Raymond.

Without realizing the gravity of his decision, he yields the power in his marriage to his wife, reversing his position of power, when he refuses to fight the knight. In addition, he displays ignorance when he does not recognize her genitals; he merely thought the knight had ‚Äúau lonc cul‚Äù [a long ass]. In an exploitation of his ignorant failure to recognize her female genitals,Gaunt, Simon. Gender and Genre in medieval French Literature.

Written by Brad Falchuk and directed by Eric Stoltz, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on January 17, 2012. It contains the revelation of an elopement, and two marriage proposals, including the proposal by Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays). Reviews were mixed for the episode. While Will's actual proposal to Emma was received with more favor than not, the scene where Will asks Finn (Cory Monteith) to be his best man was roundly condemned: the notion that Will had no adult friends and would ask one of his students was inconceivable to many. There was acclaim for the subplot featuring Becky's (Lauren Potter) pursuit of Artie (Kevin McHale), and her mental voiceovers by Helen Mirren. The musical performances from the episode were greeted more positively than the episode as a whole. All six numbers were released as singles, and five of them charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.50 million American viewers and received a 3.1/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was up from the previous episode, \\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\\". Plot After learning Coach Beiste eloped with her now husband Cooter Mankins, Emma (Jayma Mays) wonders whether Will (Matthew Morrison) is ever going to propose marriage. She fantasizes about their wedding, and in the fantasy sings \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\". She is mortified to discover that while fantasizing, she inadvertently and publicly asked Will to marry her, and immediately denies having done so. Emboldened nevertheless, Will gives the glee club an assignment: find the perfect song for him to use to propose to Emma. Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Sam (Chord Overstreet) separately recount their summer relationship to their friends, singing \\"Summer Nights\\". Sam suggests to Mercedes that they get back together, but she reminds Sam she is dating Shane (LaMarcus Tinker). Sam, hoping a varsity letterman jacket will impress her, joins the only sports team still recruiting: synchronized swimming. Later, while Mercedes sings \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" with Rachel (Lea Michele), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Santana (Naya Rivera) for Will as their proposal suggestion, she mentally pictures Sam rather than Shane, and is distressed. Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter, with inner voiceover by Helen Mirren), decides she wants Artie (Kevin McHale) for her boyfriend, and asks him for a date. He later performs for her his idea for Will's proposal‚Äîa sexy mash-up of the songs \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\"‚Äîbut she informs him that their date also includes dinner. The glee club fears Artie will be raising Becky's hopes, but Artie tells them he had fun on the dinner date, and that they should examine their own prejudices about people with handicaps. However, when Becky tells Artie that she wants to have sex with him, he panics and asks Sue (Jane Lynch) for advice on how to break off the relationship. She advises him to treat Becky like anyone else and tell her directly. Becky is disappointed, and is later comforted by Sue. Will asks Finn (Cory Monteith) to be his best man, and Finn tells Will that he is considering enlisting in the army. Will has Finn meet with him and Emma, plus his mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) and stepfather Burt (Mike O'Malley), who had not known of his army plans. Finn explains that he feels an obligation to his late father to be a good man and help people. His mother reveals that she hid from him the fact that his father did not die in Iraq, but instead suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder there, was dishonorably discharged, and died in Cincinnati from a drug overdose. The news is devastating to Finn, and he, Rachel and Kurt talk about how the future no longer appears promising. Rachel sings \\"Without You\\" to Finn, and the two embrace. Will asks Emma's parents (Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey) for their blessing to marry her, but they refuse as they doubt Emma could handle marriage and having children. Unaware of that discussion, Emma later asks Will about their progress toward marriage, and he also wonders whether she could cope with a family given her obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Though distraught, Emma tells Will that her disease is a part of her: he must decide whether they should stay together. Will, realizing that he loves Emma regardless, stages a spectacular marriage proposal‚Äîaided by the glee club and synchronized swim team, who sing and perform a water ballet to \\"We Found Love\\"‚Äîwhich Emma tearfully accepts. Later, Finn surprises Rachel with a proposal of marriage, complete with an engagement ring, which leaves her speechless. Production Filming began on November 29, 2011, the same day the ninth episode, which had begun shooting on November 10, wrapped up filming. Eric Stoltz directed the episode, his third this season following \\"The Purple Piano Project\\" and \\"Mash Off\\", and it was written by Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk. Morrison was questioned about Will's rumored proposal to Emma, and said, \\"It's the most spectacular proposal I've ever seen.\\" He added, \\"All I can say is it's wet. And it involves a big dance.\\" Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren guest-stars in the episode, but is not seen on screen: she has recorded \\"several long and hilarious monologues\\" as the \\"inner voice\\" of a character in this episode, who turned out to be cheerleader Becky Jackson. The cast and crew did location filming at Venice High School on December 6, 2011. The school is where exterior locations for the movie musical Grease were filmed. Several members of the cast tweeted photos, as did students from the high school. Vanessa Lengies, who plays Sugar Motta, retweeted a student's photo of herself with some of the students, telling the student, \\"thanks for letting us borrow your school!\\" This episode is the last in Damian McGinty's seven-episode prize from his victory in The Glee Project, but he will be continuing in the role of Rory Flanagan beyond the initial seven. Other recurring guest stars who are appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet) and Sugar Motta (Lengies), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Potter), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), Kurt's and Finn's married parents Burt Hummel (O'Malley) and Carole Hudson-Hummel (Rosemont), Emma's parents Rose and Rusty Pillsbury (Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most, respectively), football player Shane Tinsley (Tinker) and hockey player Rick Nelson (Rock Anthony). With Sam joining the synchronized swim team, actors were to be cast for the team coach and three swimmers, all of whom \\"have the potential to become recurring\\", though only two swimmers received co-starring credits in the episode. The swim team coach, Roz Washington, a bronze-medal Olympian, is being played by reality show personality NeNe Leakes. The episode features six performances, including a mash-up of the songs \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" by Maroon 5 featuring Christina Aguilera and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" by The Rolling Stones sung by McHale, \\"We Found Love\\" by Rihanna featuring Calvin Harris sung by Michele and Rivera, and \\"Summer Nights\\" from the musical Grease with lead vocals by Overstreet and Riley. Michele sings \\"Without You\\" by David Guetta featuring Usher, and she, Riley, Rivera and Ushkowitz perform a rendition of the Roberta Flack cover of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\". The 5th Dimension's cover of \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" is performed by Mays with backing vocals by Jones and Lynch. Reception Ratings \\"Yes/No\\" was first broadcast on January 17, 2012 in the United States on Fox. It received a 3.1/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted 7.50 million American viewers during its initial airing, an increase from the 3.0/8 rating/share and 7.13 million viewers of the previous episode, \\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\\", which was broadcast on December 13, 2011. In Canada, 1.61 million viewers watched the episode on the same day as its American premiere. It was the twelfth most-viewed show of the week, up one slot and 10% from the 1.46 million viewers who watched \\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\\" five weeks earlier.Canadian viewership data: *\\"Yes/No\\": *\\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\\": In the United Kingdom, \\"Yes/No\\" first aired on March 1, 2012, and was watched on Sky 1 by 805,000 viewers.

Robert Canning of IGN gave it a \\"good\\" rating of 7 out of 10, and noted \\"hit and miss musical performances, random quirky and funny bits, and storytelling choices that kind of sort of work\\". TVLine Michael Slezak was more enthusiastic, and said it was the \\"best episode\\" of the third season; he credited both Helen Mirren and \\"some righteous plot development that stays true to core characters\\". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post commented that Glee had \\"returned to its frequent habit of dropping plot twists on us that come out of nowhere\\", and MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan wrote that the episode's \\"promising bright spots couldn't escape from under the weight of the show's typical mistakes\\". Reviewers were unhappy with most of the marriage storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a \\"jackass\\" throughout and called the storyline \\"so pathetic and sad\\", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, \\"When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents.\\" John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, \\"Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends\\", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt \\"using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder\\" was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed \\"how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person\\". There was broad agreement regarding the scene where Will asks Finn to be his best man: not one reviewer approved. Lynch called it \\"questionable\\" and said it crossed a \\"line of weirdness\\", Slezak and TV Guide Kate Stanhope felt it was inappropriate, if not unethical, and Bell said the actual request was the episode's \\"biggest WTF?! moment\\". Will's statement that Finn had taught him \\"more about being a man\\" was met with incredulity. Slezak declared \\"Finn has a lot of growing up to do before he's really a man\\", and Sullivan wrote that since Finn acted \\"like a petulant man-boy\\" on the show, Will must have been referring to events in \\"a season of Glee that didn't air\\". Finn did receive some praise from Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter, however; she called the sequence where he discovers the truth about his father \\"one of Cory Monteith's best scenes yet\\", and Slezak described it as \\"beautifully handled\\" by Monteith. Finn's marriage proposal to Rachel at the end of the episode was controversial. Reviewers thought it was a bad idea‚ÄîKubicek declared, \\"No one in high school should get engaged\\"‚Äîbut Poniewozik wrote that it \\"made a lot of sense for Finn\\" as a character, and VanDerWerff said the scene \\"worked\\" for him. Helen Mirren (pictured) was acclaimed as the mental voice of Becky Jackson's thoughts. Becky's storyline was acclaimed by most reviewers. Canning called it \\"exceptional\\" and \\"the most emotional and satisfying of the episode\\". Poniewozik also praised it, and wrote, \\"Artie and Becky's arc, on the other hand, really worked: it was sweet, uncomfortable and messy in the way that Glee does well.\\" He continued, \\"it played out as it did not just because of Artie and Becky's condition but because of what they‚Äôre like as people\\". VanDerWerff said the story was \\"handled with just the right level of pathos\\", and Slezak praised the writers for turning Becky \\"into a fully realized character, while confronting head-on the dashed hopes and disappointments that can be a reality for a person with Down Syndrome\\". Sullivan wrote, \\"The plot touched on a universal experience, unrequited love, from a very Glee perspective, the treatment of handicapped people as people. It ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed Sue and Becky's touching dynamic.\\" Bell liked Sue in this episode, as she was helping the plot, which in turn made her one-liners \\"added treats rather than overdone cliches\\". The use of Helen Mirren to voice Becky's thoughts was highly praised. Poniewozik called it \\"the kind of ridiculous-but-weirdly-logical move I love from Glee\\", and Lynch said it \\"was one of the most charming treats this show has offered in a while\\". Sullivan wrote that \\"both actresses turned in great performances that elevated the episode significantly\\". Not all reviewers agreed, however: Futterman called Mirren's vocal cameo \\"bizarre\\", and although Kubicek thought Mirren was \\"pretty darn hilarious\\", he said the \\"Becky having a crush on Artie\\" story arc made him feel \\"as uncomfortable\\" as the members of New Directions, and stated, \\"It's easy to say that everyone should just treat her like they treat everyone else, but actually doing it is somewhat problematic.\\" The cameo appearance of NeNe Leakes as Coach Roz Washington received plaudits from most reviewers. Poniewozik described her as \\"pretty damn excellent\\", and Votta wrote, \\"She only has one generally pointless scene but is arguably the best part of the whole episode.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal said Leakes \\"does well\\", and Bell stated \\"she actually wasn't that bad\\". Kubicek, however, while he liked the writing for the character, wrote that Leakes was \\"an embarrassingly terrible actress\\". Music and performances The opening number of the show received the most disparate reviews from critics. Kubicek was one of the most enthusiastic about \\"Summer Nights\\", and wrote, \\"This is the kind of ridiculous, over-the-top, hilariously cheesy stuff I want to see from Glee all the time.\\" He was also pleased that Rory was given solo lines, and Sugar was \\"being embraced as a part of the group\\". Lynch thought that \\"Amber Riley and Chord Overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully\\", and gave this \\"easily the most fun number of the episode\\" an \\"A‚àí\\". Stanhope said that \\"the energy is infectious and you can feel the sparks between the former pair\\", but the performance was \\"way too much of a copycat\\" of the original Grease scene, while Flandez said that the two leads \\"lacked chemistry\\" and that the number was \\"inexplicable\\". VanDerWerff was similarly unimpressed: \\"dumb and unnecessary\\". Chaney wrote that the number \\"was a high- energy, cute way for the show to mark its comeback\\", but said that Rory \\"sounded flat\\" on one of his lines, and Sam \\"couldn‚Äôt quite hit\\" the ending high note in the song, and graded it a \\"B\\". \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" was described by Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle as \\"the perfect combination of a great song, plot relevance, and Princess Beatrice hat\\". Stanhope agreed with him on all three points, and added that it was \\"a great pick for her vocals\\". Slezak described those vocals as \\"a breath of dewy spring air\\" and gave the song an \\"A\\", but Lynch thought Emma was not \\"much of a singer\\" and gave the number a \\"B‚àí\\", though he said \\"the curiosity of backup vocals from Coach Beiste and Sue Sylvester made this entirely worthwhile\\". Poniewozik characterized the staging of the song as \\"phoned in\\". \\"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\\" was given an \\"A\\" by Lynch and an \\"A‚àí\\" by Slezak; the latter called the vocals \\"pretty electrifying\\". Flandez said the song was \\"sublime\\" and complimented the lighting, the mood, and the direction by Eric Stoltz, and VanDerWerff described it as the episode's \\"best single number\\". While Futterman thought the performers sang with \\"controlled power\\", she felt \\"singing it dressed in black with tears rolling down\\" was funereal rather than bridal, and Sullivan called it an \\"odd song choice\\" that was made \\"worse\\" by \\"Lea Michele's cry-singing\\". Chaney gave the song her lowest grade of the episode, a \\"C‚àí\\", and characterized it as a \\"flagrant eye-watering fest\\". Artie (Kevin McHale, pictured) performed the mash-up of \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and was said to outshine \\"even Mike and Will who dance beside him\\". Flandez called the \\"propulsive mash-up\\" of \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" one of the episode's \\"highlights\\", and Billboard Rae Votta said it was \\"impeccably choreographed by Glee's often unsung hero Zach Woodlee.\\" She also lauded Artie's \\"Jagger moves while sitting in a chair\\" and said he \\"outshines even Mike and Will who dance beside him\\". Sullivan described Artie as \\"consistently awesome\\", and Slezak said it was \\"one of Artie‚Äôs more appealing musical moments this season\\" and gave it a \\"B\\". Lynch characterized the song as a \\"spunky diversion\\" and gave it a \\"B+\\", but he noted it was \\"not a good song for marriage proposals by any stretch of the imagination\\", a point also made by Rolling Stone Erica Futterman, who said the number would have \\"fared much better as a stand-alone performance\\". While Chaney liked Will and Mike's \\"moves\\", she felt there was \\"far too much quick cutting to shots of Morrison in a tank top\\" and gave the song a \\"B‚Äì\\"; Slezak and VanDerWerff were also critical of these shots. Futterman was impressed that in \\"Without You\\", Glee crafted a \\"cover to rival the original\\", and said it \\"totally works\\". Slezak called it a \\"vocally stunning reimagining\\" and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\". Both Lynch and Chaney gave it a \\"B\\", and the latter wrote \\"I can't deny that she sang the heck out of it\\". Chaney was not so pleased with \\"We Found Love\\", to which she gave a \\"C\\". She wrote that it was \\"part old Esther Williams movie, part classic 'SNL' sketch with Harry Shearer and Martin Short and part music video for 'Magic' by the Cars. In short, it was kind of a train wreck.\\" However, she and Stanhope, who said it was \\"way too fast-paced\\", were in the minority. Lynch called it \\"sheer pleasure\\" and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", and Slezak was even more enthusiastic with an \\"A+\\" grade and described it as a \\"sublimely, ridiculously, excessively terrific production number\\" which he placed \\"in the show's all-time Top 10\\". VanDerWerff praised the \\"nice sense of visual spectacle\\", and Hankinson called it \\"really fantastic\\" and \\"something different\\". Futterman, after she admitted to her \\"unabashed love\\" of the song, noted that the show had \\"found the trifecta of a current song that both fits the overall theme of the show and the characters singing it\\". Chart history Five of the six singles released from the episode, which included a total of seven cover versions due to the \\"Moves Like Jagger / Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" mash-up, debuted on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Without You\\" debuted at number twenty-eight, followed by \\"We Found Love\\" at number fifty-six, the aforementioned \\"Moves Like Jagger / Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" mash-up at number sixty-two, \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" at number seventy and \\"Summer Nights\\" at number eighty-eight.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles and album tracks in the United States: \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Moves Like Jagger / Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"We Found Love\\": The same five songs charted in Canada on the Canadian Hot 100 and in the same order on that chart: \\"Without You\\" at number twenty-nine, \\"We Found Love\\" at number fifty-five, \\"Moves Like Jagger / Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" at number fifty-nine, \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" at number seventy- eight and \\"Summer Nights\\" at number eighty-five. The sixth single, \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", did not appear on either chart.

Life  Isaac Armalet was born in Mardin and joined the Charfet Monastery in Lebanon at the age of 16. He was ordained a priest in 1903 and later became close to the Syriac Catholic Patriarchs Ephrem Rahmani and Gabriel Tappuni. Armalet was arrested during the First World War by the Ottoman Army, but was later released.

The changing refractive index causes light to change speed throughout the material and produce light and dark regions in the crystal. The buildup can be controlled to produce holographic images for use in biomedical scans and optical computing. The ease with which the chemical composition can be changed in organic materials makes the photorefractive effect more controllable. History Although the physics behind the photorefractive effect were known for quite a while, the effect was first observed in 1967 in LiNbO3. For more than thirty years, the effect was observed and studied exclusively in inorganic materials, until 1990, when a nonlinear organic crystal 2-(cyclooctylamino)-5-nitropyridine (COANP) doped with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) exhibited the photorefractive effect. Even though inorganic material-based electronics dominate the current market, organic PR materials have been improved greatly since then and are currently considered to be an equal alternative to inorganic crystals. Theory There are two phenomena that, when combined together, produce the photorefractive effect. These are photoconductivity, first observed in selenium by Willoughby Smith in 1873, and the Pockels Effect, named after Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels who studied it in 1893. Photoconductivity is the property of a material that describes the capability of incident light of adequate wavelength to produce electric charge carriers. The Fermi level of an intrinsic semiconductor is exactly in the middle of the band gap. The densities of free electrons n in the conduction band and free holes h in the valence band can be found through equations: n=N_{c}\\\\frac{e^{-(E_{c}-E_{F})}}{k_{B}T} and h=N_{v}\\\\frac{e^{-(E_{c}-E_{F})}}{k_{B}T} where NC and NV are the densities of states at the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band, respectively, EC and EV are the corresponding energies, EF is the Fermi level, kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. Addition of impurities into the semiconductor, or doping, produces excess holes or electrons, which, with sufficient density, may pin the Fermi level to the impurities' position. Doped semiconductor: Fermi levels pinned at the position of the dopant in the band gap A sufficiently energetic light can excite charge carriers so much that they will populate the initially empty localized levels. Then, the density of free carriers in the conduction and/or the valence band will increase. To account for these changes, steady-state Fermi levels are defined for electrons to be EFn and, for holes ‚Äì EFp. The densities n and h are, then equal to n=N_{c}\\\\frac{e^{-(E_{c}-E_{Fn})}}{k_{B}T} h=N_{v}\\\\frac{e^{-(E_{Fp}-E_{v})}}{k_{B}T} Doped semiconductor: Fermi level Ef and quasi-Fermi levels upon illumination The localized states between EFn and EFp are known as 'photoactive centers'. The charge carriers remain in these states for a long time until they recombine with an oppositely charged carrier. The states outside the EFn ‚Äì EFp energy, however, relax their charge carriers to the nearest extended states. The effect of incident light on the conductivity of the material depends on the energy of light and material. Differently-doped materials may have several different types of photoactive centers, each of which requires a different mathematical treatment. However, it is not very difficult to show the relationship between incident light and conductivity in a material with only one type of charge carrier and one type of a photoactive center. The dark conductivity of such a material is given by \\\\sigma _{d}=e\\\\left ( N_{d}-N_{d}^{+} \\\\right )\\\\beta \\\\mu \\\\tau where œÉd is the conductivity, e = electron charge, ND and N are the densities of total photoactive centers and ionized empty electron acceptor states, respectively, Œ≤ is the thermal photoelectron generation coefficient, Œº is the mobility constant and œÑ is the photoelectron lifetime. The equation for photoconductivity substitutes the parameters of the incident light for Œ≤ and is \\\\sigma _{ph}=e\\\\left ( N_{d}-N_{d}^{+} \\\\right )\\\\frac{sI\\\\mu \\\\tau }{h u } in which s is the effective cross-section for photoelectron generation, h is the Planck constant, ŒΩ is the frequency of incident light, and the term I = I0e‚àíŒ±z in which I0 is the incident irradiance, z is the coordinate along the crystal thickness and Œ± is the light intensity loss coefficient. The electro-optic effect is a change of the optical properties of a given material in response to an electric field. There are many different occurrences, all of which are in the subgroup of the electro-optic effect, and Pockels effect is one of these occurrences. Essentially, the Pockels effect is the change of the material's refractive index induced by an applied electric field. The refractive index of a material is the factor by which the phase velocity is decreased relative to the velocity of light in vacuum. At a microscale, such a decrease occurs because of a disturbance in the charges of each atom after being subjected to the electromagnetic field of the incident light. As the electrons move around energy levels, some energy is released as an electromagnetic wave at the same frequency but with a phase delay. The apparent light in a medium is a superposition of all of the waves released in such way, and so the resulting light wave has shorter wavelength but the same frequency and the light wave's phase speed is slowed down. Whether or not the material will exhibit Pockels effect depends on its symmetry. Both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric media will exhibit an effect similar to Pockels, the Kerr effect. The refractive index change will be proportional to the square of the electric field strength and will therefore be much weaker than the Pockels effect. It is only the non-centrosymmetric materials that can exhibit the Pockels effect: for instance, lithium tantalite (trigonal crystal) or gallium arsenide (zinc-blende crystal); as well as poled polymers with specifically designed organic molecules. It is possible to describe the Pockels effect mathematically by first introducing the index ellipsoid ‚Äì a concept relating the orientation and relative magnitude of the material's refractive indices. The ellipsoid is defined by \\\\frac{R_{1}^{2}}{\\\\varepsilon _{1}}+\\\\frac{R_{2}^{2}}{\\\\varepsilon _{2}}+\\\\frac{R_{3}^{2}}{\\\\varepsilon _{3}}=1 in which Œµi is the relative permittivity along the x, y, or z axis, and R is the reduced displacement vector defined as Di/ in which Di is the electric displacement vector and W is the field energy. The electric field will induce a deformation in Ri as according to: \\\\Delta R_{i}^{2}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{3}r_{ij}E_{j} in which E is the applied electric field, and rij is a coefficient that depends on the crystal symmetry and the orientation of the coordinate system with respect to the crystal axes. Some of these coefficients will usually be equal to zero. Organic Photorefractive Materials PVK In general, photorefractive materials can be classified into the following categories, the border between categories may not be sharp in each case * Inorganic crystal and compound semiconductor * Multiple quantum well structures * Organic crystalline materials * Polymer dispersed Liquid crystalline materials (PDLC) * Organic amorphous materials Electronic states of PATPD (a) and PVK (b)-based composite with DBDC and 7-DCST as chromophores and C60 as sensitizer In the field of this research, initial investigations were mainly carried out with inorganic semiconductors. There have been huge varieties of inorganic crystals such as BaTiO3, KNbO3, LiNbO3 and inorganic compound semiconductors such as GaAs, InP, CdTe are reported in literature.K. Buse, J. Imbrock, E. Kr√§tzig, K. Peithmann, in Photorefractive Materials and Their Applications II: Materials (Eds: P. G√ºnter, J. P. Huignard ), Springer Series In Optical Science, Vol. 114, Springer, Berlin 2006, 83‚Äì121 First photorefractive (PR) effect in organic materials was reported in 1991 and then, research of organic photorefractive materials has drawn major attention in recent years compare to inorganic PR semiconductors. This is due to mainly cost effectiveness, relatively easy synthetic procedure, and tunable properties through modifications of chemical or compositional changes. Polymer or polymer composite materials have shown excellent photorefractive properties of 100% diffraction efficiency. Most recently, amorphous composites of low glass transition temperature have emerged as highly efficient PR materials. These two classes of organic PR materials are also mostly investigated field. These composite materials have four components -conducting materials, sensitizer, chromophore, and other dopant molecules to be discussed in terms of PR effect. According to the literature, design strategy of hole conductors is mainly p-type based and the issues on the sensitizing are accentuated on n-type electron accepting materials, which are usually of very low content in the blends and thus do not provide a complementary path for electron conduction. In recent publications on organic PR materials, it is common to incorporate a polymeric material with charge transport units in its main or side chain. In this way, the polymer also serves as a host matrix to provide the resultant composite material with a sufficient viscosity for reasons of processing. Most guest-host composites demonstrated in the literature so far are based on hole conducting polymeric materials. The vast majority of the polymers are based on carbazole containing polymers like poly-(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) and polysiloxanes (PSX). PVK is the well studied system for huge varieties of applications.M. B. Klein, in Photorefractive Materials and Their Applications II: Materials (Eds: P. G√ºnter, J. P. Huignard ), Springer Series In Optical Science, Vol. 114, Springer, Berlin 2006, 241‚Äì284 In polymers, charge is transported through the HOMO and the mobility is influenced by the nature of the dopant mixed into the polymer, also it depends on the amount of dopant which may exceed 50 weight percent of the composite for guest-host materials. The mobility decreases as the concentration of charge-transport moieties decreases, and the dopant's polarity and concentration increases. Besides the mobility, the ionization potential of the polymer and the respective dopant has also significant importance. The relative position of the polymer HOMO with respect to the ionization potential of the other components of the blends determines the extent of extrinsic hole traps in the material. TPD (tetraphenyldiaminophenyl) based materials are known to exhibit higher charge carrier mobilities and lower ionization potentials compare to carbazole based (PVK) materials. The low ionization potentials of the TPD based materials greatly enhance the photoconductivity of the materials. This is partly due to the enhanced complexation of the hole conductor, which is an electron donor, with the sensitizing agents, which is an electron acceptor. It was reported a dramatic increase of the photogeneration efficiency from 0.3% to 100% by lowering the ionization potential from 5.90 eV (PVK) to 5.39 eV ( TPD derivative PATPD). This is schematically explained in the diagram using the electronic states of PVK and PATPD. Applications As of 2011, no commercial products utilizing organic photorefractive materials exist. All applications described are speculative or performed in research laboratories. Large DC fields required to produce holograms lead to dielectric breakdown not suitable outside the laboratory. Reusable Holographic Displays Recording of Holographic Image Many materials exist for recording static, permanent holograms including photopolymers, silver halide films, photoresists, dichromated gelatin, and photorefractives. Materials vary in their maximum diffraction efficiency, required power consumption, and resolution. Photorefractives have a high diffraction efficiency, an average-low power consumption, and a high resolution. Updatable holograms that do not require glasses are attractive for medical and military imaging. The materials properties required to produce updatable holograms are 100% diffraction efficiency, fast writing time, long image persistence, fast erasing time, and large area. Inorganic materials capable of rapid updating exist but are difficult to grow larger than a cubic centimeter. Liquid crystal 3D displays exist but require complex computation to produce images which limits their refresh rate and size. Blanche et al. demonstrated in 2008 a 4 in. x 4 in. display that refreshed every few minutes and lasted several hours. Organic photorefractive materials are capable of kHz refresh rates though it is limited by material sensitivity and laser power. Material sensitivity demonstrated in 2010 require kW pulsed lasers. Tunable Color Filter White light passed through an organic photorefractive diffraction grating, leads to the absorption of wavelengths generated by surface plasmon resonance and the reflection of complementary wavelengths. The period of the diffraction grating may be adjusted by modifying to control the wavelengths of the reflected light. This could be used for filter channels, optical attenuators, and optical color filters Optical communications Free-space optical communications(FSO) can be used for high-bandwidth communication of data by utilizing high frequency lasers. Phase distortions created by the atmosphere can be corrected by a four-wave mixing process utilizing organic photorefractive holograms. The nature of FSO allows images to be transmitted at near original quality in real-time. The correction also corrects for moving images. Image and Signal Processing Organic photorefractive materials are a nonlinear medium in which large amounts of information can be recorded and read. Holograms due to the inherent parallel nature of optical recording are able to quickly process large amounts of data. Holograms that can be quickly produced and read can be used to verify the authenticity of documents similar to a watermark Organic photorefractive correlators use matched filter and Joint Fourier Transform configurations. Logical functions (AND, OR, NOR, XOR, NOT) were carried out using two-wave signal processing. High diffraction efficiency allowed a CCD detector to distinguish between light pixels (1 bits) and dark pixels (0 bits).

Through his maternal side, he had distant English and French ancestry. He also had an older brother, Hendrik Philip Jacob Baron van Heemstra (1867‚Äì1931). He studied at Utrecht University where he obtained his doctorate in law in 1896. He established himself in Arnhem where he was prosecuting lawyer and subsequently deputy judge at the district court. In 1902 he was appointed official at the district court in Roermond and in October 1909 deputy public prosecutor at the arrondissement court of Maastricht. In 1910 he became mayor of the city of Arnhem, following Antonie R√∂ell and preceding Dirk Jan de Geer. In 1920 Wilhelmina of the Netherlands appointed him governor of Suriname, from which he retired in 1928. Living in the Arnhem region, he redacted a political economic magazine until 1940. Refusing to collaborate with the NSB during World War II, the German occupiers confiscated many of his possessions, including estates, bank accounts, and even jewelry. He was forced to move out of the estate outside Arnhem to Oosterbeek and later Velp. In 1942, his son- in-law Otto graaf van Limburg Stirum was executed in retaliation for a sabotage by the resistance movement. After this, his widowed daughter Miesje (1897‚Äì1987) and his divorced daughter Ella (1900‚Äì1984) lived with him in Velp, along with Ella's youngest child, the future actress Audrey Hepburn (1929‚Äì1993). Van Heemstra died in Oosterbeek. Family In 1896, he married Elbrig Willemine Henriette Baroness van Asbeck (1873‚Äì1939), who was a granddaughter of Dirk van Hogendorp.

Personal life Little is known about Lady Wilbraham's private life, but private letters were discovered and passed to the Staffordshire Record Office in 2008. These showed Lady Wilbraham's search for suitable husbands for her daughters, Grace and Margaret. According to the marketing executive of the Weston Park Foundation, \\"The letters explain the importance of a suitable match within the aristocracy of the day. She was certainly a very strong lady and knew what she wanted and how to get it\\".Rare letters of Weston Park aristocrat donated to public records, The Birmingham Post, 26 November 2008 (archived on thefreelibrary.com). Retrieved 2012-02-02. First known woman architect A 2012 book by historian John Millar claims that Elizabeth Wilbraham is the first known woman architect. Millar says this follows more than 50 years of research into the subject. In 2007 the owners of the stately home, Wotton House, organised a conference to investigate who was the original architect of the building. The conference generated at least two follow-up papers: in 2010 Sir Howard Colvin proposed that John Fitch may have been the original architect, and later the same year, Millar, noting Colvin's paper, proposed Lady Wilbraham as an alternative.Colvin's paper was published in the 2010 Georgian Group Journal During the seventeenth century it was impossible for a woman to pursue a profession and Lady Wilbraham is said to have used male executant architects to supervise construction in her place. She is believed to have designed more than a dozen houses for her family and, because of the inclusion of distinctive and unusual design details, has been put forward by Millar as the designer of 18 London churches (officially attributed to Christopher Wren). Because Wren came late to architecture, Elizabeth Wilbraham has been suggested by Millar as his most likely tutor. As many as 400 buildings have been suggested by Millar as possible works of Elizabeth Wilbraham. They all generally show similarities with Italian or Dutch architecture. Wilbraham owned a 1663 edition of Palladio's book I Quattro Libri (volume I) and she heavily annotated it. In the authoritative and encyclopaedic Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840 (4th Edn; 2008) by Sir Howard Colvin, however, she is mentioned only once. That notation is as a patroness of architecture. In her dissertation from 2002, Canadian historian, Cynthia Hammond mentions the ‚Äúawkward designations‚Äù given to Lady Wilbraham by Nikolaus Pevsner. She notes his lack in saying ‚Äúby Wilbraham‚Äù to denote an eroding of Wilbraham‚Äôs authorship when discussing Weston Park.Hammond, Cynthia Imogen.

Life and career Born in Tucson, Arizona, she began performing as a teenager in community and regional musicals, ultimately moving to Washington D.C. with her family when her father Dean Burch entered Republican party politics in the 1964 White House run for the Presidency by Barry Goldwater. She continued working in the D.C. area and eventually entered Carnegie Mellon University, where she stayed until a move to New York in the 70's. Shelly was cast in her first Broadway show six months after her arrival. She played one of Sammy Davis Jr.'s daughters in the revival of Stop the World ‚Äì I Want to Get Off, which began its run in California and came to Lincoln Center, NY. In 1979, after several cabaret appearances, she snagged the role of Star-To-Be in Annie on Broadway, and also played the role of Lily St. Regis. In 1980, Tommy Tune cast her in his original Broadway production of Nine. She played the role of Claudia and introduced Maury Yeston's \\"Unusual Way\\". The role earned her kudos, including one from Frank Rich (then the drama critic for The New York Times), in which he called her \\"a Modigliani goddess with another strong voice and an almost otherworldly presence\\".Rich, Frank (May 10, 1982). \\"'Nine,' A Musical Based on Fellini's '8 1/2'\\", The New York Times, p.

She stayed on the show for eight years, and at the same time honed her cabaret skills. In 1989, after having left Llanview (where One Life took place), she created the role of Julie for the Paper Mill Playhouse's production of Show Boat, which subsequently was filmed by PBS for Great Performances. In 1990, she moved to Florida, got married and had three children. During her Florida residency, she continued to perform regionally and sang in numerous churches and at the Holy Land. She also worked extensively at Disneyland and continued her cabaret and night club career. She also performed at diverse locations such as the Republican National Convention and RFK Stadium, stirring audiences with her version of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". In 2003, after roles such as Patsy Cline in \\"An Evening With...\\" and Aldonza in Man of La Mancha, she called her old friend and Annie director Martin Charnin to come and create a new night club act for her. He did. The act played in Orlando, Washington D.C., and eventually in 2009 came to the Metropolitan Room in New York City. In 2004, family-in-hand, she moved to the Pacific Northwest and became a regular in the Seattle and environs theater scene. In 2006, she and Mr. Charnin married and they continued working together in the Pacific Northwest, until they returned to the East Coast in July 2012. Shelly has done several revues at The Emelin Theatre in Mamaroneck, New York and several one-woman shows in New York City at 54 Below and The Metropolitan Room all directed by Mr. Charnin.

Early life and time in Spain  Alonso de Illescas was born around 1528 and raised off the coast of western Africa on either the Cape Verde Islands or the island of Tenerife, a Spanish possession since the 15th century.Afro-Latino Voices: Narratives from the Early Modern Ibero-Atlantic World, 1550-1812, ed. Kathryn Joy McKnight and Leo J. Garofalo (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, 2009), 32. As a child he was given the name of Enrique; however, he was later confirmed with the name he commonly used, which was also the name of his owner.The Human Tradition in the Black Atlantic, 1500-2000, ed. Beatriz G. Mamigonian and Karen Racine (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 10. The location of his homeland made it ideal as a slave-trading post, and between the ages of eight and ten years old he was taken to Seville, Spain where he served as a slave to one of the city‚Äôs richest and most prominent merchant families, the Illescas. It was during this time he learned the Spanish language, religion, culture, and traditions. More specifically, he learned the Spanish style of formal address, how to play the vihuela (Spanish guitar), and became versed in Catholic prayers and learned the sacraments.The Human Tradition in the Black Atlantic, 1500-2000, ed. Beatriz G. Mamigonian and Karen Racine (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 11. He lived in Seville for seventeen years before he was sent to the Caribbean to assist his owners. He first spent time on the island of Santo Domingo where his owners established a merchant enterprise which included clothing, cured meats, swords, horses, olive oil, wine, and the selling of Africans.The Human Tradition in the Black Atlantic, 1500-2000, ed. Beatriz G. Mamigonian and Karen Racine (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 13. In contrast to the lives of other Africans who were brought to the Americas as slaves, Illescas more than likely never worked on a sugar plantation or in a rice field. Instead, he was a trusted personal servant expected to perform many duties for his owners and probably served as elder Illescas' personal servant during his youth in Seville. From the Indies he traveled to Panama and then to Peru, the silver-producing capital of the early Spanish Empire. Records indicate that he and Alvaro, one of his owners, were active in Peru by 1551. In 1553, he along with twenty-three \\"Guinea slaves\\" departed the port of Panama on the southbound journey to Lima, Peru. The journey proved to be typical in that the ship's pilot had to contend with north and westerly Pacific Ocean currents and therefore decided to seek harbor in San Mateo Bay on the Esmeraldas coast. In spite of this, the ship ran aground inside the bay and stranded the crew, passengers, and slaves onshore. They were forced to travel along ragged shorelines to reach the nearest settlement, Puerto Viejo. In the course of the journey, Illescas and the other slaves decided to seize the moment to head into dense forest and claim their freedom. None of the crew or passengers ever reached Puerto Viejo.  Life in Esmeraldas  Illescas, along with his fellow escapees, struggled to survive at first, making alliances with and attacks against native communities. The first leader of the group was an African named Ant√≥n. It is not quite clear what the exact fate of Ant√≥n was; however, historian Charles Beatty Medina offers two theories as to what became of him. One is that he died in battle and the other is he was ostracized from the community and might be the same person who was taken and executed as a sorcerer by Spanish soldiers in the 1580s.The Human Tradition in the Black Atlantic, 1500-2000, ed. Beatriz G. Mamigonian and Karen Racine (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 15. Illescas eventually rose to a position of leadership by way of alliances that he struck with the local Nigua indigenous communities. He officially became the leader of his Maroon community in the late 1560s. Throughout the rest of the sixteenth century under his leadership, the community came to include Amerindians and even a few Europeans. Examples include the Trinitarian friar named Alonso de Espinosa, who served as a minister at the request of Illescas, and most notably Illescas‚Äô chief assistant, a Portuguese soldier named Gonzalo de Avila, who remained among the Maroons after the unsuccessful military campaign of Mart√≠n de Carranza.The Human Tradition in the Black Atlantic, 1500-2000, ed. Beatriz G. Mamigonian and Karen Racine (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 16. Similar to other maroon communities, Illescas' communities' inhabitants intermarried with and subjugated native communities, thus allowing him to establish a level of political authority and military power in the region. The African men intermarried with local native women, many formed polygamous partnerships, and their offspring at first were referred to as mulattoes by the Spanish and by the 1590s as zambos. In the 1570s Illescas' Maroon community also began trading with Spanish ships that periodically stopped on the Esmeraldas coast. However, he had to assert dominance over another group of African Maroons, called the Mangaches that formed after another coastal shipwreck. The region's remote geography with dense forests and mangroves and the indigenous inhabitants' (Campazes who lived south of the Bay of San Mateo)Charles Beatty- Medina, \\"Caught Between Rivals: The Spanish-African Maroon Competition for Captive Indian Labor in the Region of Esmeraldas during the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries,\\" The Americas 63, no. 1 (July 2006): 113. prolonged resistance to Spanish rule helped to enable the Maroon community to survive for generations. Illescas wanted to make peace with Spanish authorities in exchange for official recognition of himself and his community members as free Africans.Charles Beatty-Medina, \\"Caught Between Rivals: The Spanish-African Maroon Competition for Captive Indian Labor in the Region of Esmeraldas during the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries,\\" The Americas 63, no. 1 (July 2006): 119. However, after the Real Audiencia, the Crown Court in Quito, was formed in 1563 and by the urging of its first president, Hernando de Santill√°n, Spanish merchants asserted their desire for a port closer to Quito for increasing trade with Peru and Panama because of the cost of transporting their goods overland from Guayaquil. Therefore, in 1577 the Real Audienica proposed to appoint Illescas as governor of the region and to give him the honorific title of ‚ÄúDon,‚Äù a form of address denoting noble status. This unprecedented honor for an African Maroon was a royal decree that would have made Illescas ruler of the province. In exchange he was supposed to persuade other chieftaincies of the region, along with rival maroon bands, to settle at the mouth of the Esmeraldas River.Afro-Latino Voices: Narratives from the Early Modern Ibero-Atlantic World, 1550-1812, ed. Kathryn Joy McKnight and Leo J. Garofalo (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, 2009), 31. Illescas‚Äô attempt to do this led to internal warfare between both maroon communities and lowland native societies. In 1586, Illescas dictated a letter to Espinosa to the Spanish Crown and its authorities in Quito and Madrid. He petitioned the King of Spain to rescind the grant that Rodrigo de Ribadeneyra, a wealthy merchant, had received in 1585 to establish settlements in Esmeraldas. Instead of having outsiders come in, he offered to ‚Äúpacify‚Äù his native neighbors.\\"Alonso de Illescas to Real Audiencia in Quito, 1586\\", in Afro-Latino Voices: Narratives from the Early Modern Ibero-Atlantic World, 1550-1812, ed. Kathryn Joy McKnight and Leo J. Garofalo (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, 2009), 35. This statement demonstrates how there existed a territorial competition among lowland societies who were vying to dominate both the land and the people who lived there. By examining the letter further, the reader can discover how Illescas, like his fellow African Maroon leaders, formed dynamic relationships with the environment, native societies, and colonial authorities.Afro-Latino Voices: Narratives from the Early Modern Ibero-Atlantic World, 1550-1812, ed. Kathryn Joy McKnight and Leo J. Garofalo (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, 2009), 30. Nevertheless, the letter was received as little more than a bothersome attempt by Espinosa to delay events that the royal authorities envisioned. Ribadeneyra failed to gain allegiance of Illescas and other Maroon leaders and never was able to create settlements in the region.  Death and fate of the Maroon community  Near the end of Illescas' life, he ruled his community with the help of two sons, Sebasti√°n and Antonio.Charles Beatty Medina, \\"Caught Between Rivals: The Spanish-African Maroon Competition for Captive Indian Labor in the Region of Esmeraldas during the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries,\\" The Americas 63, no. 1 (July 2006): 129. There is no historical record of Alonso de Illescas after the 1590s. Therefore, he must have died in the Esmeraldas region at some point between 1587 and 1596.The Human Tradition in the Black Atlantic, 1500-2000, ed. Beatriz G. Mamigonian and Karen Racine (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 20. While Illescas did not live long enough to witness a peace agreement with the Real Audiencia of Quito, it was achieved. His son Sebasti√°n obtained the title of Don and was recognized as leader over the Illescas Maroons by 1600. In addition, Sebasti√°n received the sacrament of confirmation by Quito‚Äôs bishop in 1600 and he took Alonso as his confirmation name. Illescas' family ruled Esmeraldas for at least two more generations.  Legacy  In 1997, the National Congress of Ecuador officially declared 2 October as the national day of Black Ecuadorians and thus gave formal recognition to Alonso de Illescas as a national hero.Bill Smith, \\"In Recognition of Afro-Ecuadorian Heritage Day\\", African American ‚Äì Latino World Blog.

Plot The film tells the story of Joyce Carol Vincent, whose skeletal remains were found in her flat in Wood Green, North London, in January 2006. Joyce was found surrounded by wrapped Christmas gifts and with her TV still switched on, having remained undiscovered since December 2003. Due to advanced decomposition, the cause of death was unable to be determined. The film features interviews with various friends, acquaintances, former partners and individuals involved in the developing news story, including Vincent's MP, Lynne Featherstone, in an attempt to tell the story of Joyce, who is played in reconstructions by Ashton. Vincent's father is played by Cornell John. The film confronts issues such as loneliness, even while living in one of the busiest cities, how loss of contact with family and friends can cause no one to notice a missing relative or friend, and how a body can go unnoticed in a room feet away from a busy street, without repercussions from unpaid rent and utilities. Production Director Carol Morley was inspired to make the documentary on Joyce's life after reading an article in a tabloid newspaper which she found discarded on the London Underground, which while describing Vincent failed to mention her age, race or any detailed information. She spent the next 5 years tracking down interviewees by taking out ads in newspapers, and hiring a cab to drive around London bearing a poster asking people to contact her if they knew Joyce. She was surprised to learn that many of the respondents did not know Joyce was dead until she spoke to them even though some of them remembered hearing of her death when it was reported on in newspapers. One of the first respondents to Morley's advert was Martin, who features prominently in the film, an ex- partner and one-time close friend who was able to provide photographs for Morley. Martin then put her in touch with other friends, including an ex- landlord, ex-partner and friend who had recorded her singing in his studio. Morley was criticized for an extended fictionalized sequence that featured Zawe Ashton as Joyce performing the song A Smile is Just a Frown. She stated that she was inspired to keep the sequence in the film by a similar sequence in Agn√®s Varda's Cl√©o from 5 to 7 and also credited Varda's documentary work with inspiring much of her movie. Morley was also in contact with Joyce's four sisters, all of whom refused to be in the film. Although they asked Morley not to make the film, she went ahead with production, but gave them an advance screening in order to show that she had been respectful in remembering their sister. Reception The film received a rating of 62 on aggregate movie review website Metacritic and 74% on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating an overall positive reception. Despite some 'lukewarm' reviews on its release, The Guardian described it as \\"empathic, brave, clever, haunting\\", while The New York Times reflected on the frustrating nature of the story only half told. The Telegraph described the film as a \\"tender, thoughtful and celebratory homage to Vincent‚Äôs life\\". Steven Wilson's album Hand. Cannot. Erase. was inspired by his viewing of the movie. Paloma Faith's song \\"Lost and Lonely\\" from the album The Architect was written and recorded in response to seeing Dreams of a Life.Radio 4 interview with Richard Coles 16 May 2020  url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j7g7 References External links * * Category:2011 films Category:British documentary films Category:English-language films Category:2011 documentary films Category:Documentary films about women Category:Films set in London Category:British films Category:Films about dreams ","title":"Dreams of a Life"},{"id":"34051410","text":"Anerastia mitochroella is a species of snout moth in the genus Anerastia.

Although penikisite and kulanite both range from blue to green, penikisite zones are easily distinguishable from kulanite zones in kulanite-penikisite crystals because they are lighter than the darker kulanite in color. Penikisite is a phosphate and is different from kulanite in that it is a magnesium-rich phosphate whereas kulanite is an iron-rich phosphate. Introduction Penikisite, ideally Ba(Mg,Fe,Ca)Al2(PO4)2(OH)3, is a second occurrence of kulanite. Both kulanite and penikisite are members of the bjarebyite group. Minerals in the bjarebyite group have the general formula XY2Z2(PO4)3(OH)3 where X=Ba, Y=Mg, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Z=Al, Fe3+.Cooper M. & Hawthorne F.C., [\\"Refinement of the crystal structure of kulanite\\"], Can. Mineral, 1994 Penikisite was found in a Yukon phosphate deposit near Rapid Creek. The mineral, along with kulanite, occurs in an iron- formation.Robertson, B.T. [\\"Occurrence of epigenetic phosphate minerals in a phosphatic iron-formation, Yukon Territory\\"], Mineral. Rec., 1982 In these iron-formations, Mg-rich zones were discovered and named penikisite in honor of Gunar Penikis who discovered these phosphate occurrences with Alan Kulan. Composition The chemical formula of Penikisite is Ba(Mg,Fe,Ca)Al2(PO4)2(OH)3. Mandarino and Sturman analyzed two penikisite samples and eight kulanite samples using an AMX electron miscroprobe (1977). Their study showed weight percent oxides, including H2O, that help determine what the formula is for penikisite and kulanite. Members of the bjarebyite group have the general formula XY2Z2(PO4)3(OH)3 where X=Ba, Y=Mg, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Z=Al, Fe3+. Accompanying penikisite in this group are as follows: bjarebyite, ideally BaMn2+2Al2(PO4)3(OH)3, perloffite, ideally BaMn2+2Fe3+2(PO4)3(OH)3, kulanite, BaFe2+2Al2(PO4)3(OH)3, and johntomaite, ideally BaFe2+2Fe3+2(PO4)3(OH)3. These minerals are identified when Ba in the X position is one of the most abundant elements in their composition along with being phosphates. Physical properties Penikisite ranges from blue to green with a vitreous luster and, when rubbed along a streak plate, can be pale green to white. Depending on the thickness of the sample, the mineral can be either transparent or translucent. Both kulanite and penikisite are triclinic and have the space group P1*.Mandarino, J.A. & Sturman, B.D., \\"Kulanite, a new barium rich aluminum phosphate from the Yukon Territory, Canada\\", Can. Mineral., 1976 Penikisite can also have a space group of P1. The cell dimensions of this mineral were calculated by Mandarino and Sturman (1977) by least-squares refinement of the X-ray powder diffraction data to be: a 8.999, b 12.069, c 4.921√Ö. The mineral is non-fluorescent under short- and long-waves. It has a harness of about 4 and a density of 3.79(2) g/cm3. There are two fair to good cleavages on {010} and {100}. Penikisite is biaxial (+) with nŒ± 1.684(2), nŒ≤ 1.688(2), nŒ≥ 1.705(2). The 2V(Œ≥) calculation is 56¬∞ and the 2V measurement is 52.2¬∞ . The pleochroism for penikisite is X grass-green, Y blue-green, Z pale pink. The absorption is X~Y>Z. Geologic occurrence In recent years, Rapid Creek, in the northeastern corner of Yukon Territory, has become more popular in the mineralogist community. This is because of the large deposit of phosphate minerals that have been discovered in the area. Texturally, the rocks of Rapid Creek are similar to other Phanerozoic phosphate and iron deposits; they are composed of pellets and granules, detrital quarts grains, skeletal fragments, and siderite mud matrix. Discovered in phosphate-ironstones that crop out near Rapid Creek, penikisite and kulanite occurs in fractures in a sideritic iron-formation.

His tenure lasted from February 15, 2012 to November 9, 2015, and ended amid controversy surrounding race relations at the university. Early life Wolfe was born in Iowa City, Iowa, and moved to Columbia, Missouri, when he was in fourth grade. He was quarterback of the Rock Bridge High School team that won the class 3A Missouri state high school football championship in 1975. His father was a communications instructor at the University of Missouri from 1967 to 1997 and his mother taught in the Columbia school system from 1968 to 1972 before going on to teach at the Massachusetts School of Law. He matriculated at the University of Missouri, earning a bachelor's degree in personnel management from the Trulaske College of Business in 1980. While an undergraduate, he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Wolfe interned for Cramer Products for eighteen months, and he was on the business school's Dean's List. In 1995, Wolfe completed Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. Computer business career In 1980, he became a sales representative in Jefferson City, Missouri for IBM. He worked in various capacities for IBM for twenty years. Wolfe subsequently worked for Covansys as an executive vice president. In 2003, he began working for Novell Americas, where he served as vice president and general manager of the Southeast region. Three years later, he began overseeing the East region instead. Wolfe was promoted to president of Novell Americas in October 2007, overseeing Novell's operations in the Americas. Novell was acquired in 2010 by Attachmate. University of Missouri The announcement of his selection occurred on December 13, 2011, nearly 11 months after the previous president Gary Forsee stepped down to take care of his ailing wife. Wolfe took office on February 15, 2012. Steve Owens had been interim president. The appointment marked the second consecutive time that a businessman rather than educator became president (Forsee was CEO of Sprint). Wolfe said he hoped he would serve in the position for a long time before he finally retired. Wolfe said that he did not expect the university system's financial troubles would be difficult compared to the financial situations of some of his previous employers. Wolfe's initial contract called for a $450,000 annual salary and $100,000 in bonus potential. He also received free housing and a car or car allowance. He lived in Columbia on university grounds at Providence Point (although he said initially his family would continue to live at their home outside of Boston, Massachusetts. The editorial board of the St. Louis Post- Dispatch criticized the University of Missouri's Board of Curators for hiring someone with no professional experience in educational settings who needed a two-month \\"journey of enlightenment\\" to learn about each of the four campuses' needs.  University of Missouri Press  In May 2012, Wolfe announced that the University of Missouri Press' $400,000 subsidy would end. (Link is to on- line version of July 17, 2012.) Two months later, he announced that the press would close and that there would be a new publishing model that would be more effective at distributing scholarly publications. The publishing staff said that the new publishing model described what they were already doing. Wolfe said he did not know how much the new model would cost and that he had not spoken to any employees at the press before making his decision. In October 2012, it was announced that the University of Missouri Press would not close after all. Wolfe said that he always intended to increase the cost- effectiveness of the press and that it was never the plan to close the press. He said that he should have spoken to more press employees, authors, and other publishers earlier in the decision-making process.  Funding cuts  In 2013, the Missouri House of Representatives passed a bill to cut funding to elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities, and impose sales tax on purchases of college textbooks. Governor Jay Nixon vetoed the bill. Wolfe said he agreed with the governor's veto because decreases to individual income tax rates should not be financed by cutting education.  Racial controversy and resignation  In 2015, Wolfe was the subject of criticism from a variety of groups over his perceived failure to address a series of alleged racist incidents at the University of Missouri. Drawing condemnation from black student organizations. In November 2015, Missouri's Legion of Black Collegians announced that approximately thirty athletes would not participate in any team activities unless Wolfe resigned. On November 9, 2015, Wolfe resigned at a special Board of Curators meeting that morning. In a statement, he said, \\"My motivation in making this decision comes from a love of Columbia where I grew up and the state of Missouri. I thought and prayed over this decision. It is the right thing to do. ... The frustration and anger I see is real and I don't doubt it for a second. ... I take full responsibility for the actions that have occurred. I have asked everybody to use my resignation to heal.

Founded in 1863 by John Denton and William Gray as a partnership, it became a private and then a public limited company under the leadership of three generations of the Gray family until finally wound up in 1962. Company history Denton, Gray & Co. In 1839 John Punshon Denton established a shipyard in Middleton, Hartlepool to build and repair wooden-hulled sailing ships. In 1863 Denton entered into a partnership with William Gray, a successful businessman with a chain of stores in Hartlepool, to form Denton, Gray and Company. The shipyard was modernised and extended, and began to build iron-hulled ships. Their first ship was launched on 23 January 1864. In 1865 Denton, Gray and Co. established a new partnership with the shipbuilders Richardson, Duck and Co. of Stockton- on-Tees, and marine engine builders T. Richardson and Sons called Richardson, Denton, Duck and Co. However, business was poor, and the partnership only completed only four ships before being dissolved in September 1866, when the companies returned to their original ownership and names. In 1867-68 Denton, Gray and Co. expanded their premises, taking over a neighbouring shipyard in 1868, which allowed them to diversify their business into ship repairs. In 1869 the company moved to a larger yard in West Hartlepool which covered eight acres, and employed up to 1,200 men. The partnership ended on John Denton's death in 1871. By this time Denton and Grey were in dispute over which of their sons should be allowed to join as partners. The case had gone to court, but as the company had been founded with no formal signed contracts, the courts were unable to reach a decision. Eventually Denton's sons left the company, and in 1874 it was renamed William Gray & Company, and Gray took on his eldest son Matthew as partner. William Gray & Co. The business flourished, and in 1878 Gray's held the British record for output, with 18 ships launched in a single year, and the company soon became West Hartlepool's largest producer of iron clipper barques, sailing ships and steamers. Now employing some 2,000 men, the company recorded the highest output of any British shipyard six times between 1878 and 1900. In 1883 Gray's established the Central Marine Engineering Works, to manufacture their own marine engines, recruiting the engineer Thomas Mudd from T. Richardson and Sons to set up the business. On 1 January 1889 Gray's became a private limited company, with William Gray as chairman, and his sons Matthew and William, and son-in-law George Henry Baines, as directors. In recognition of his numerous charitable works, and tenure as Mayor of West Hartlepool, William Gray was knighted in 1890. Between 1892 and 1895 one of the key customers for the company was the Shell Transport and Trading Company who had eight oil tankers built. Matthew Gray died in 1896, followed in 1898 by both Sir William Gray and Thomas Mudd, which left Sir William's younger son, William Cresswell Gray, as chairman. He expanded the company, purchasing the Milton Forge and Engineering Company, allowing Gray's to increase its production of marine engines, boilers, pumps and other machinery. In association with Sir Christopher Furness, he also bought the Moor Steel and Iron Works of Stockton-on-Tees, the Stockton Malleable Iron Works, and the West Hartlepool Steel and Iron Works, which were amalgamated into a new company, the South Durham Steel and Iron Company Ltd., which provided the materials to build Gray's ships. In 1900 two more slipways were built, making a total of eleven, and the company now employed 3,000 men, who built 200 ships up to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The war brought an increase in activity to the shipyard, and by 1918, Gray's had built 30 cargo liners and tramp steamers, 13 vessels for the Admiralty, including four s, and 30 standard \\"War-class\\" cargo ships for the Shipping Controller. A facility was also established at the Central Marine Engine Works, employing mainly women, to produce shell cases. On 14 June 1917 King George V and Queen Mary visited the shipyard as part of a morale-boosting visit to the area, and on 7 July 1917 William C. Gray was created 1st Baronet Gray of Tunstall Manor. In 1918 Gray's became a public company. However, in the early 1920s the company experienced financial difficulties owing to the post-war slump in the freight market, which was flooded with war-surplus vessels. In 1922 the company built only three ships, and in 1923 only seven. In 1924 Sir William Cresswell Gray died, and the chairmanship of the company passed to his son, Sir William Gray, 2nd Bt. He had to manage a company heavily in debt, but despite this the company completed its 1,000th ship in 1929. In 1930, when the Great Depression struck, the shipyard was closed due to lack of orders. In 1932 the yard temporarily re-opened to build a Tees pilot launch and six tramp steamers, before being closed again. In 1934 the yard re-opened to build two paddle steamers to provide a passenger ferry service across the River Humber. In 1935 the yard reopened briefly to build a tramp steamer, which was not sold for another two years. Not until 1936 did business began to improve, and in the years up to 1939, the company completed thirty tramp steamers and cargo liners, and two s for the Royal Navy. The outbreak of World War II saw a revival in activity with 72 ships built and 1,750 ships repaired between 1939 and 1945. Post-war, British ship production went into general decline with the emergence of Japanese and German shipbuilders. Gray's built an average of only 7.5 ships per year, along with a number of tankers, between 1945 and 1959. In 1959 the only orders on the books were for two ore carriers. The last ship built by Gray's was launched in 1961. Repair work continued into 1962, until the company finally went into voluntary liquidation.

It is \\"the first and possibly the only novel by a Deaf American to focus on Deaf culture\\" (Peters 122). Islay was published in 1986 by T.J. PUBLISHERS, INC. located in Silver Spring, Maryland. The novel tells the story of the protagonist Lyson Sulla, who has a goal of becoming Governor of the State of Islay and making it a state by and for Deaf people. About the author Douglass Bullard (1937‚Äì2005), was a graduate of Gallaudet College. He grew up in the Deep South and traveled around the world as well as lived in many different places. He was an Alaskan geologist and is the author of several novels. Islay, however, is the only work of his that was published. He was the president of the Florida Association of the Deaf for some time. Writing style The text of Islay is written in three different codes. The bulk of the text is written in English. Additionally, American Sign Language used in dialogue between characters is written in italicized ASL Gloss. Finally, dialogue across TTY machines in Islay is written in capital letters. The italicized gloss form of ASL used in Islay is neither truly English nor truly ASL. An example of this gloss form, coming from Lyson about his desire for a homeland for the Deaf is as follows: You know that Laurent Clerc had same dream. Himself greatest deaf in history, started Golden Age for deaf there France. Then brought sign here America; almost started new Golden Age for us deaf, but hearing oralism frustrated him, broke up deaf cooperation and almost destroyed Sign Language. That why Clerc liked idea for deaf gathering into one state where deaf itself normal! (6‚Äì7). The ASL gloss used in Islay is a word for word translation of ASL, keeping word order but losing much of the grammar of the language. This method shows the differences between spoken English and sign language. An example of the TTY writing form is as follows: MARY HERE. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN Q. I WAITED SINCE SIX. DISGUSTED GA. (67). When using a TTY, the 'Q' after a sentence makes it a question. 'GA' means \\"go ahead\\", which informs the person on the other line that you are done talking and they can type their response. Islay 's different coding styles are unique, but easily understood by those with a background in American Sign Language and TTYs. Meaning of title When the book was first released, there was much talk about what the title meant. Some people speculated it was a mix of the finger spelled acronyms for \\"I Love You\\" (ILY) and American Sign Language (ASL) while others hypothesized it was derived from \\"island\\". \\"Bullard actually came across the word in the dictionary, liked how it sounded, and decided to use it ‚Äì then later flew to the island Islay off the coast of Scotland only to discover that the real island closely resembled his fictional one\\" (Peters 124). Plot summary The book has three sections, titled \\"Strings\\", \\"Drums\\", and \\"Cymbals\\". These three sections document Lyson's journey to make Islay a Deaf state. He comes across many problems along the way, and is ridiculed by some. Others accuse him of being a peddler and he is misunderstood by many. His wife, in the beginning of the novel is embarrassed by his dream and keeps Lyson behind lock and key when he is working on his project. She does not want her friends to know about what he is doing and does everything in her power to keep it a secret. In the first section, \\"Strings\\", the book's protagonist Lyson Sulla is in the beginning stages of his plans for a state by and for Deaf people. He is learning about the state Islay, and how it could work for what he is envisioning. He receives financial support from his in-laws so that he can move to Islay. Once there, he spends a week's time looking over the state, seeing how it will work for him, and meeting with public officials. He is pleased with what he sees in Islay and believes that it will work for what he plans. He moves his wife, Mary out to Islay with him. Once they are moved into a large home, they throw a big party. The second section, \\"Drums\\" documents Lyson's travels to recruit other Deaf people to move to Islay. He meets many Deaf people along the way and is able to convince many well-established Deaf people to move to Islay. He also has a few misunderstandings along the way when people misunderstand what his intentions and meanings are. In the last section, \\"Cymbals\\", many Deaf people move their families to Islay and open businesses. Lyson still has troubles, as he is accused of real estate fraud. However, he gets out of this predicament. Those who moved to Islay register to vote, so as to help Lyson become governor. The election is a rough experience for Lyson, but in the end he wins, becoming Governor of Islay.

HISTORY When Gallaudet opened in 1892 so did the Buff and Blue. It was Dr. J. C. Gordon that decided the name even though the magazine was created by the students and supported financially by the staff. However, before this magazine could be distributed the students had to create a committee to spread the word the word about the project they were working on. They printed out a letter and sent it to all the alumni and Gallaudet supporters that explained what the magazine would look like, what the price would be and what kind of issues the students would write about within the magazine. The feedback they received was very positive and because there was so much support for the idea that the students were able to move forward with developing the Buff and Blue.

His work may be found in collections around the globe, including those of members of the British Royal Family. He is recognized for the strength and beauty of his letterforms and his calligraphy manuals are recommended to their students by calligraphy teachers around the world. Personal life Born Charles Rothwell Pearce in Aston, Birmingham, he is the eldest son of Charles Kenneth Rothwell Pearce, an English and Drama teacher, later Headmaster, and Winifred Helen Mary Pearce (n√©e Evans), a concert pianist. He has two brothers, Robert and Julian, and a sister, Barbara. In 1966, he married Linda Margaret (n√©e Cook), and lived for three years in Palmers Green, London, before moving to Hertford in 1969 and then to Ware, Hertfordshire. They have three sons: Charles Mark Rothwell (b. 1967), Aaron Xavier (b. 1972) and Daniel Alexander (b. 1977). Pearce and his wife were divorced in 1979. Education He studied at Tettenhall College (Wolverhampton), and the Leek School of Arts and Crafts (Leek, Staffordshire). At the Central School of Arts and Crafts (London), he studied with Dorothy Mahoney, William Gardner, and Ann Camp. At the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts (London, England), he studied under Donald Jackson and Sidney Bendall, graduating with a National Diploma in Design at Special Level in Writing and Illuminating and Lettering. Professional years After graduation Pearce went to work for Decca Records in their Lambeth studio designing record sleeves and promotional literature, and then on to a small advertising agency in the West End of London. He left there to become an assistant to both Donald Jackson and Sidney Bendall. He worked with Bendall for some four years designing and cutting letters in stone and wood, but remained with Jackson for almost fifteen years, through 1979. In 1971 he was made a Fellow of the Society of Scribes & Illuminators. Pearce and Jackson worked on many commissions which came into Jackson's studio. One included a huge family tree which measured 8 ft by 4 ft, and was a large board covered with a cowhide which had been prepared as for vellum. A large amount of his time during this period was involved in the design and signage for Cranks Health Foods until they were taken over by Guinness. In 1980 Pearce moved to New York City to live and work. While living in New York he primarily worked for two major clients: Pentalic Corporation and RKO Century Warner Theaters. It was during this time that he was awarded artist in residence status by the City, which thus allowed him to convert loft space into a working studio. Pearce moved to Cleveland in 1991 and worked in the American Greetings design studios for almost ten years, during which he was trained in the use of computer technology. He finally left to go back to working freelance and was granted a contract by AG for 16 months to give him the opportunity to work his way back into that market. Freelance work Pearce began to use brushes on canvas rather than pens and paper which gave him the opportunity to work considerably larger than previously. He has developed a technique which involves the throwing of paint onto raw canvas, to create the start of his paintings. He then stretches the canvas onto frames/stretchers which he has designed specially to take the force of stretching the canvas, which doesn't involve any cross-bracing. His largest single canvas to date measures 5 ft by 9 ft. It was on a visit back to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where he had taught a workshop back in 1988, that he was suddenly struck by the idea that he no longer needed to live in Cleveland and could, in fact, do something which he had wanted to do for much of his life: live in the country. In late 2000 he bought 12 acres just outside Eureka Springs and began work on designing and constructing a studio in which he could also live. Whiskey Spring Studio was completed in 2003. While no longer a member of the Eureka Fine Art Gallery, he continues to paint in his studio, constantly expanding the use of calligraphy in abstract paintings. He also works occasionally with John Robert Willer, another fine Arkansas painter, with whom he has been creating a series of Ozark paintings which they call the \\"Blue Grass Series\\". He is currently working to have his paintings established in cities around where he lives. he is represented by J. r. Jones and the Two25 Gallery and Wine Bar in Bentonville.

Retrieved 23 February 2012 Tyburn Convent is now the Mother House of the Congregation. Devotion Mother Mary of St Peter founded the Adorers to carry out Adoration of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the exposed Blessed Sacrament, originally in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Montmartre. The religious foundation then moved to enclosure and Adoration in the monastic setting, building up numbers towards Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament by the community. This Adoration was to be made in reparation for offences against the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Sacrament. Mystical experiences in the early Congregation in France confirmed that Adoration was needed to atone for sacrileges and blasphemies against the Blessed Sacrament committed by priests and lay people. The Foundress at this time also discerned a particular charism of prayer for priests. Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament has continued ever since the convent was established in London, except for wartime when the convent was bombed and Adoration was relocated to Wadhurst in the English countryside. Pilgrims and tourists from all over the world visit the shrine.Tess Livingstone: Tyburn Sisters' communities spread around the world Website of AD2000 \\"a journal of religious opinion\\". Retrieved 23 February 2012 Rule of Life The Congregation follows the Rule of St Benedict as its rule of life. This is augmented by norms, a manual and a book of customs of the Congregation. The sisters wear the traditional black Benedictine habit, but with a modernised veil and guimpe (wimple). Postulants wear lay dress and a short black veil. Novices wear the habit with a white veil and white choir cloak. Junior professed sisters wear the black veil and Congregation medal and white choir cloak. Perpetually professed sisters wear the black veil, medal, ring, and white choir cowl. The Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours are recited in the vernacular (English, Spanish). Expansion The Tyburn community has opened other monasteries in Scotland, Ireland (at Cobh), New Zealand (two foundations, Tyburn Monastery at Bombay, Auckland and Tyburn Monastery Cor Iesu Fons Vitae at Ngakaru, Rotorua in the Hamilton Diocese), Australia (at Riverstone), Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and France at St Loup-sur- Aujon close to the birthplace of the Foundress, Mother Marie Ad√®le Garnier. The Rome monastery has been temporarily closed, and the Riverstone monastery will shortly relocate further inland and closer to the Blue Mountains. Although the Congregation was founded to carry out Perpetual Adoration, today each monastery mostly only carries out Adoration during the day, and shares this with the laity. A new foundation in Africa opened, but had to be closed again soon afterwards. The Congregation has also offered assistance to ageing Benedictine communities in Europe. The Congregation numbers around 60 professed sisters worldwide in total, plus some sisters in formation.

Its publisher and editor Joseph Willcocks established it after moving to Niagara in 1807 to combat arbitrary power, oppressive land laws, and ultimately create liberty in the province. Willcocks claimed that the Guardian was meant: ‚Äúto disseminate the principles of political truth, check the progress of inordinate power, and keep alive the sacred flame of a just and rational liberty.‚Äù In 1809, Judge William Dummer Powell complained of its widespread popularity and the fact that it was in nearly every household. It was a four-page paper (11 by 17 and a half inches) published between July 24, 1807 and June 9, 1812 and printed in with the roman cursive ‚Äúf‚Äù representing the English long \\"s\\". The Upper Canada Guardian came to an end when Willcocks sold its printing press to Richard Hatt in June 1812 for $1,600. Upper Canada papers before the Upper Canada Guardian The first newspaper published in Upper Canada was the Upper Canada Gazette in April 1793 in Niagara which recognized that a community benefits from political press and aimed to publish accounts of government events. The Tiffany brothers (Gideon and Silvester) created the first independent newspaper in Niagara July 1799, known as the Canada Constellation. However, the paper lasted only until 1800 due to its pro-American sympathies and a lack of government aid and subscriptions.  Beginning of political opposition  William Weekes' attacks of the government in 1806 over \\"financial mismanagement\\" led him to meet Robert Thorpe, a newly immigrated judge who did not fear supporting Weekes and his beliefs. In fact, Thorpe went behind the back of British officials and helped the assembly to oppose the government. After Weekes' address to Sir Francis Gore in 1806 over his disappointment \\"of the neglect of public interest and arbitrary nature of government\\" and his later death, Thorpe took over his position. He came to Niagara and formed a partnership with Willcocks, and together they followed in Weekes' footsteps. They did not concern themselves with petitioning the British government as Weekes did, but rather were the first to oppose the Upper Canadian government on a \\"systematic basis.\\" Prior to Weekes' death in 1806, Thorpe and Willcocks had already begun to resist authoritarian rule in 1805. Thorpe argued that: ‚Äúthe colony of Upper Canada was subject...to the control of Parliament though (like Ireland, Man, and the rest) not bound by any acts of Parliament, unless particularly named.‚Äù Willcocks began to question his bond to the acts of Parliament using Thorpe as inspiration. Together, their political and public discourse eventually fully adopted the 18th century Whig tradition by being ‚Äúopposed to arbitrary and distant power, valu[ing] loyalty to [the] country rather than to [the] rulers and believed in independence of colonial legislatures.‚Äù The basis of the Whig mentality is acknowledging the errors of the past for the sake of the present, and through emphasizing liberty and innovation, one can become successful in this opposition. This eventually led to their formation of an opposition group from 1806 to 1808. Willcocks and Thorpe each held public meetings; where Willcocks was concerned about asking the attendees advice on issues. According to historian Bruce Wilson, this proved to be beneficial to Willcocks as it aided him in \\"[forging] an effective local position to the mercantile-official elite of the Niagara district.\\" In 1811, the Thorpe-Willcocks assembly group, including Charles Burton Wyatt and John Mills Jackson used their connection to Britain to continue their opposition against Governor Gore, and created a petition over the \\"partiality and corruption\\" of the provincial administration. Inhabitants realized the irresponsibility and evil existence in the legislature but had no newspaper press to stimulate their observations. For the first fifteen years of Upper Canada existing, the Provincial Government did as they pleased without being criticized. There was the Upper Canada Gazette that officially represented the Administration but they ‚Äúrefused to publish opposition election addresses or rebuttals to libels made by government supporters.‚Äù The Upper Canada Guardian was the first paper in Upper Canada to finally publish opposition opinions. As J.J.Talman commented of the time: \\"There was no Hansard in Upper Canada and the journals of the legislature [gave] only a bare account of the business carried on, we are entirely dependent on newspaper reports for information as to what, and how much, was said on the floor of the assembly.\\" Although the group could not be labeled a \\"party\\" (as it had no formal structure) they still managed in gaining other members and creating strong ideals by having practical and educated responses to issues of the day, such as: ‚Äúland-granting, executive power, and social inequities.‚Äù However, Governor Gore often saw it as bad conduct, and in 1807 they were both prosecuted; Thorpe was removed from the bench and Willocks lost his office of the sheriff in the Home District. It was at this point where when Willcocks gained freedom from office liability that he decided to create the Upper Canada Guardian. Thorpe later used the Upper Canada Guardian in November of that year to make an address, responding to the situation: \\"Though wretched, even to agony, whilst under the slightest imputation, yet your welfare, your happiness and the prosperity of the province, shall engage my attention and animate my exertions.\\"  Goals and subject matter  On Thursday, November 5, 1807, the first copies of the Upper Canada Guardian were released with the credentials clearly summarized on the front page. The goal of the paper claimed to set justice, end oppression and diminish partiality, and that the greatest efforts would be made to: \\"preserve in its true balance, the Prerogative of the Crown -- the Privileges of the People -- the Degrees in Society -- and the Rights of every Individual in the Community.‚Äù Willcocks wanted to reach out to gain the: \\"assistance of the learned, the indulgence of the experienced, and the protection and support of the People.\\" He claimed credibility by noting his association with people from Great Britain, Ireland, New York, Boston, Halifax and Quebec; and urged readership by claiming that he depended on subscribers for advertisements and \\"domestic occurrences.\\" The opening sentences of the paper summarize Willcocks' inspiration in starting the Upper Canada Guardian and reveal its ambitions: > The Editor of the GUARDIAN is convinced that a Free Press is essential to a > Free state, and assures the Province, that over his Publications there shall > be neither inspector nor Licenser except the Law and the Constitution; for > what the eye of the Law cannot inspect with approbation, never shall be > suffered to insult the eye of the Public; and what the Constitution will not > fully license, never shall be offered to disgust the Loyal and Faithful > Subjects of our Gracious Sovereign.‚Äù The general factors that caused political opposition in Upper Canada in 1802 to 1804 were the: \\"widespread reaction against government changes in land policy[...]which increased the fees on land grants and tightened the rules concerning the eligibility of loyalists for free land grants.\\" The Upper Canada Guardian took on these kinds of issues and often included advertisements for land and documentation of agricultural and commercial improvements. Amongst all this, Willcocks did not initially aim to explicitly reveal his strong oppositional force in which the paper was essentially driven. With the Upper Canada Guardian Joseph Willcocks wanted to: ‚Äúrevolutionize the province‚Äù despite knowing the probable controversy it would cause. Because of his Whig ideology, he did not see a contradiction between his loyalty and opposition to the Upper Canadian government. He had a strong political opinion and was not afraid to voice it in the paper. In an 1809 issue, Willcocks observed that: \\"Our Magistrates are not moved with the same tender compassion towards the people and impose no more taxes on them than would be actually wanting to defray the District Expenditures.‚Äù His loyalty drove him to take advantage of the power of the press; he used the paper as a platform to communicate the assembly's and his personal opinions of government in Upper Canada. He also provided opportunity for others to engage in conversation by publishing letters that were written to the newspaper and his response; or even a letter that questioned another letter that was addressed to the paper. Willcocks even promoted his own personal business of ‚Äúconveyancing‚Äù although it antagonized the legal profession of his day. He published this address in nearly every issue: ‚ÄúThe undersigned flatters himself with the hope that by his strict attention to the commands of all those who may wish to employ him, in conjunction with his knowledge of the business, to render that general satisfaction which will secure to himself the patronage of a discerning public.‚Äù Essentially, Willcocks desired to inspire his readers into acting justly despite the consequences. In the last issues of the paper on June 9, 1812, he claimed that he was an enemy ‚Äúof the measure of the Kings Servants in this colony‚Äù and that he was a: ‚Äúconstant adherent to the interests of the Country.‚Äù  Controversy  Gore attacked the Upper Canada Guardian and claimed that the \\"Seditious Printer\\" made ‚Äúvulgar attacks‚Äù on the government that were \\"relished too much, by the good people of Upper Canada.\\" . He was an object of hate to Governor Gore as he described him as a: ‚Äúexecrable monster who would deluge the Province with blood.‚Äù In 1808, Willcocks' opinion took him too far and he was imprisoned for accusing: ‚Äúevery member of the first provincial parliament [that they] had received a bribe of twelve hundred acres of land[...]to vote against interests of constituents.‚Äù Willcocks responded to the matter by publishing a lengthy letter in the March 18, 1808 edition of the paper defending himself and arguing that this claim was blown out of proportion: ‚ÄúAs a proof of the misconception and incorrect statement of the informants (for they cannot be considered as witnesses when not under an oath), I have only to refer you to that paragraph in the Guardian which expressly states, that Governor Hunter DID NOT bribe the members of the House of Assembly.‚Äù Willcocks was not successful in accomplishing much change in Upper Canada because he was being persecuted so often. The government in which Willcocks‚Äô was opposing saw his desires of reform in the paper occasionally as unrealistically hopeful.  Willcocks' positive reputation  Being the first politically critical newspapers in Upper Canada in the 19th century, the Upper Canada Guardian gave Willcocks the opportunity to lead groups in opposition of the administration. Although his jail prosecution served as a minor setback, it also gained him the sympathy of the victims of the issues that he addressed (such as small farmers and/or loyalists who wanted land grant privileges), a seat in parliament and more readers. Willcocks claimed he was the: ‚Äúonly man in Canada that dare speak the truth.‚Äù Even though controversy creates problems, there are some benefits that can always be gained from them eventually. In this case, Joseph Willcocks gained the reputation of a man who was not afraid to publish his opinion to the public; a near first in Upper Canada in the early 19th century. Even though the Upper Canada Guardian exhibited Willcocks' seditiousness against the government, it was not his goal to be perceived as a radical personage: > \\"It is not my intention, Gentlemen, by a recital of sufferings, to influence > or irritate the minds of an injured, insulted, and loyal people. No: but it > is my intention and my wish to impress upon the public mind the > indispensable necessity there is of sending men to the new parliament, whose > livelihood or prospects in life do not depend upon the will or caprice of > any tyrannic individual, and whose principles are unambitious, and beyond > the reach of corruption.\\" The Upper Canada Guardian was Willcocks' biggest achievement because it initiated opposition through action and press in Upper Canada in the 19th century. His commitment to civil liberties eventually led him to treason against Upper Canada as he sided with the Americans in the War of 1812. He was later killed in battle in Fort Erie, Upper Canada.

At a very young age, he began appointing name signs for others. Both of his parents were deaf and he had three brothers, two deaf and one hard of hearing. Supalla is notable for his storytelling performances in American Sign Language (ASL), particularly for his narrative in The American Literature Series: For a Decent Living. He is a filmmaker and a linguist ‚Äúwhose interest lies in the research and English development issues concerning deaf children‚Äù and stresses the importance of a natural sign language. Early life Before enrolling in school, Samuel's father would often go to the Deaf Club bringing the whole family along to attend. Samuel himself remembers the old stories and plays that were performed in ASL. The audience at the Club shared a fascination for these ASL stories. He graduated from the Oregon School for the Deaf. Throughout preschool and elementary, the program enforced oralism amongst deaf students where signing was not allowed. Although the children were not allowed to sign, they would do so in their dormitories. ‚ÄúI had become a signing model for my peers during the early formative years. When Supalla went home, he made up stories about an imaginary white horse, and when he returned to school, he told his classmates. When the students visited his home, ‚Äúthey would ask where the white horse was. I would have to lie and tell them that the white horse died. They were disappointed that they never got to see the white horse‚Äù. Talent competition When Supalla was 15, the Oregon School for the Deaf was invited by Gallaudet University to go to National Association of the Deaf. There was a talent competition in front of an audience of Gallaudet students. Supalla won the competition. College years At the end of high school, he enrolled at California State University Northridge in 1976 and graduated as a History major. During his college years, he was invited to a conference on American Sign Language research, as a part of the entertainment for the conference. It was this engagement that established the start of his professional career. During this period of his life, he travelled for the purpose of doing live shows/storytelling in front of many audiences. He worked as a research assistant at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. His next move was to apply to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1982, where he was admitted and majored in education with a concentration in bilingual education. It was at the University of Illinois that he received his Masters and Doctorate degrees. Career After graduating from the University of Illinois, Supalla was offered a job at the University of Arizona. He took the job and moved to Tucson, Arizona, in 1989. His prime focus at the University is on disability and psychoeducational studies. ‚ÄúHis original work on how artificial English-based sign systems fail has led to a greater appreciation of American Sign Language (ASL) as a working language in terms of visual perception and processing.‚Äù Supalla is concerned with literacy issues regarding learning to read and write in English. ‚ÄúIn the case of deaf children, the need to develop a 'mother tongue' (e.g., ASL) is stressed in order to facilitate the learning of a second language (e.g., English) within the context of bilingualism.‚Äù Supalla's The Book Of Names Signs was published 1992.Publications recognized It describes the origins of American Sign Language name signing. ASL-phabet is a system designed by Supalla. It is the American Sign Language dictionary for kids which consists of over 300 sign words that include symbols such as Handshape, Location, and Movement. It is a ‚Äúprimary source of English for deaf learners‚Äú. Supalla contributed to A Free Hand: Enfranchising the Education of Deaf Children.

The parent album fared only slightly better, climbing to No. 69. When it was time to release the follow-up album, Robert Stigwood, manager of The Bee Gees and owner of RSO Records, rejected the proposed album after the failure of the lead single, \\"Wouldn't I Be Someone\\". The album was shelved, and only a few songs ever received official release. \\"Elisa\\", \\"Wouldn't I Be Someone\\" and \\"King and Country\\" were released as singles in 1973, and then again in 1990 on the box set Tales from the Brothers Gibb. Another track, \\"It Doesn't Matter Much to Me\\", was released on a budget label compilation album in the UK in 1974.

Joan, concurrently with Typhoon Ivan to its west, also became the strongest typhoons at the same time in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The 25th named storm during the active 1997 Pacific typhoon season, Joan developed from the same trough as Typhoon Ivan on October 11\\\\. It moved northwestward and later to the west, undergoing explosive deepening to its peak intensity on October 15\\\\. One typhoon warning agency estimated that Joan was among the strongest storms on record in the basin, and that Ivan and Joan marked the first occurrence of simultaneous super typhoons. While near peak intensity, Joan passed between Anatahan and Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Later, the typhoon weakened and turned to the north and east, becoming extratropical on October 24\\\\. On Saipan, Typhoon Joan destroyed 37 houses and caused an island-wide power outage. Three people were injured due to boarding up their house during the storm. On nearby Anatahan, high winds caused $200,000 (1997 USD) worth of crop and property damage. Later, high waves affected southern Japan and northwestern Hawaii. On Chichi-jima, Joan caused a boat to capsize, killing one of its occupants and leaving two others missing. Meteorological history In the first week of October 1997, westerly winds near the equator in the western Pacific Ocean produced troughs - extended areas of low pressure - at a low latitude in the northern and southern hemisphere. The system in the South Pacific eventually developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi, while the trough in the northern hemisphere eventually spawned two systems - Typhoon Ivan formed to the west, and the system that would eventually become Typhoon Joan developed along the eastern periphery. By October 10, the eastern system consisted of an area of poorly-organized convection, moving slowly to the northwest. On the next day, satellite imagery suggested a circulation had developed. The system increased in size and the convection organized further, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression 28W on October 13. Also on that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression had developed near the Marshall Islands. After its development, the depression turned more to the west, intensifying into Tropical Storm Joan on October 14\\\\. Early in the storm's duration, neither the JTWC nor most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated significant strengthening beyond 1-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph); this was due to a fairly weak monsoon trough and normal atmospheric pressures in the region. Late on October 15, the JTWC upgraded Joan to typhoon status, and the JMA followed suit the next day. Over a 36‚Äëhour period beginning at 1800 UTC on October 15, the JTWC estimated that the pressure decreased by , or roughly per hour; based on the agency's assessment, Joan underwent explosive deepening during that time, reaching an estimated minimum pressure of . Near peak intensity, Joan had a well-defined eye within a circular area of very deep convection, organized to such an extent that it warranted a Dvorak rating of at least T8.0, the highest number on the scale used to estimate tropical cyclone intensities via satellite imagery. If the estimate were correct, it would make Joan among the top five Pacific typhoons on record. On October 17, the JTWC estimated 1-minute peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph), making Joan a super typhoon, the ninth of the season. By contrast, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) with a pressure of . While near peak intensity on October 17, Joan was located about 2100 km (1300 mi) east of Typhoon Ivan, which had also reached super typhoon status; the JTWC later noted that it was \\"the first observation of two tropical cyclones of such extreme intensity existing simultaneously in the Northwest Pacific.\\" Despite the proximity to Ivan, the two typhoons did not undergo the Fujiwhara effect. The JTWC estimated that Joan weakened slightly after reaching peak winds, although the JMA maintained the typhoon at peak intensity for nearly three whole days. Joan gradually turned more to the northwest, passing between Anatahan and Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands (NMI) on October 18. On October 20, the JMA estimated that the typhoon began weakening, and on the same day Joan turned sharply to the north. On the next day, Joan weakened below super typhoon intensity for the first time in 4.5 days, a record at the time based on JTWC analysis. This record was later surpassed by Typhoon Fengshen in 2002 and Typhoon Ioke in 2006. By October 21, the typhoon had accelerated to the east and was quickly weakening. The next day, Joan passed about 230 km (145 mi) north of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. On October 24, the typhoon turned to the northeast while losing tropical characteristics, and that day the JMA ceased tracking Joan. The JTWC declared the typhoon as extratropical on October 25 around the same time it crossed the international date line. Former Typhoon Joan merged with a cold front and re- intensified while approaching the Aleutian Islands, and was noted by the Mariners Weather Log as an extratropical storm on October 26. Impact Ivan (left) and Joan (right) on October 18 While passing about 80 km (50 mi) of Saipan, Joan produced wind gusts of 157 km/h (98 mph), strong enough to destroy 37 homes and damage the roofs of several other houses. Residents were slow to prepare for the typhoon, and as a result, three people were injured while boarding up their house during the arrival of the strong winds. The passage of Joan left the entire island of Saipan without power, although electrical crews quickly worked to restore the outages. During the storm's passage, about 900 people stayed in shelters, after the government opened six schools for residents. In nearby Anatahan, Joan left heavy damage to boats, machinery, and public buildings. The typhoon damaged various crops, and monetary damage was estimated at $200,000 (1997 USD). As a result of the damage, both islands within the NMI were declared disaster areas, which allowed residents and businesses to apply for federal loans through the United States Small Business Administration. While passing between Saipan and Anatahan in the NMI, the eye of Joan was visible by NEXRAD from Guam, despite being 285 km (180 mi) north of the island. An outer rainband moved across the island, producing 56 mm (2.2 in) of rainfall at Anderson Air Force Base and a wind gust of 66 km/h (41 mph) at the National Weather Service office in Tiyan. Typhoon Joan produced waves as high as 7 m (22 ft) in the southern islands of Japan. In Chichi-jima, the typhoon dropped and brought winds as strong as 91 km/h (60 mph). The combination of strong winds and high waves on the island broke a boat from a moorings, causing it to capsize when the boat struck rocks. Of the five people on board, two swam safely to shore, two were reported missing, and one person was confirmed killed. The extratropical remnants of Joan also produced high swells in Hawaii, with wave heights of 4.6 m (15 ft) along northern shores.

Prior to serving as Executive Director, Vogt served as Chief of Operations for Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey and later as the Director of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs for Traversant Group. On January 11, 2019, Governor Ducey nominated Vogt to serve as the Director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. On June 11, 2013, Governor Janice K. Brewer appointed Vogt to be the Director of the Arizona Department of Veterans' Services. He assumed office on July 1, 2013 and was confirmed unanimously by the Arizona State Senate on January 30, 2014.  Biography  Vogt was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, when his family moved there in 1974. He was an Eagle Scout. He graduated from Judge Memorial Catholic High School in 1991 and received a B.A. in History from Yale University in 1995. He was a substitute teacher for a short time in Salt Lake City. From 1995 until he entered the United States Air Force in 2000, Vogt spent time chiefly in the private sector as an investment banker in the New York metropolitan area, advertising executive at Leo Burnett in Chicago, (beginning during the 1996 U.S. presidential election) executive assistant to then-former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, and at night a member of The Second City comedy troupe (1997‚Äì2000). From 2000 until 2006, Vogt was an intelligence officer in the United States Air Force. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, he served in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and throughout the greater Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2006, Vogt was stationed at the Pentagon where he was a daily intelligence briefer for both the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Leaving active duty in 2006, Vogt moved to Tucson and entered law school at the University of Arizona's James E. Rogers College of Law. Vogt's home page at 50th legislature While in law school, Vogt remained involved in Homeland and National Security matters. During the summer of 2008, he worked on Homeland Security issues at the White House for the Office of Vice President Cheney. In 2009, Vogt clerked for United States Senator Jon Kyl on the Senate Judiciary‚Äôs Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security in Washington, D.C., as well as for the Criminal Division within the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office in Tucson. Vogt was appointed to the Arizona Legislature during his final semester at Rogers College of Law. Controversy erupted when Vogt, who had been selected by his classmates to serve as one of their graduation speakers prior to his appointment to the Legislature, voted for the controversial anti-illegal immigration bill Senate Bill 1070 (S.B. 1070). Some classmates wanted him to step down as their class speaker, while most supported his right to speak. Ultimately, Vogt chose to speak at the graduation ceremony, while nearly 20 students walked out on his speech, returning at the conclusion of his remarks. Vogt was awarded his J.D. in 2010. He passed the bar later that year, and entered private practice in Tucson, Arizona.  Legislative career  He was first appointed to the Arizona House of Representatives on March 16, 2010 by the Pima County Board of Supervisors to fill the vacancy created when then- State Representative Frank Antenori was appointed to the Arizona State Senate to fill the seat vacated by State Senator Jonathan Paton who resigned to run for Congress in Arizona's 8th congressional district. Vogt won election to the Legislature on November 2, 2010. In the 50th Legislature, Vogt served as the Chairman of the House Ethics Committee; Vice Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; and Member of both the House Judiciary Committee and the Higher Education, Innovation and Reform Committee. Vogt is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a national group of conservative state legislators who meet to network with one another and to understand concerns of business. The group also drafts model legislation, some of which has been then introduced in state legislatures. In 2011, Vogt sponsored major legislation granting all honorably discharged veterans automatic in-state tuition at all three of Arizona's state universities, as well as all community colleges. Governor Jan Brewer signed the bill into law on April 12, 2011, and the law became effective July 2011. Vogt also sponsored legislation to help combat human smuggling in Arizona. House Bill 2405 was also signed by Governor Brewer and became effective in July 2011. In 2012, he was a prime sponsor of several bills. One of them, (HB2395) sought to reduce copper theft. In 2012, he was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election from the newly drawn 10th district.

It depicts Alexander the Great with the family of Darius III, the Persian king he had defeated in battle. Although Veronese had previously painted a version of the subject, since destroyed, the theme had rarely been depicted by other artists before him.Salomon, 846 The painting has been in the collection of the National Gallery in London since 1857. Narrative In 333 BC Alexander defeated Darius III, the last king of the Achaemenid Empire, at the Battle of Issus. Darius escaped capture, but his wife Stateira I, his mother, Sisygambis, and his daughters Stateira II and Drypetis were taken by Alexander. Alexander displayed forgiveness in victory. According to Plutarch: \\"[He] gave them leave to bury whom they pleased of the Persians, and to make use for this purpose what garments and furniture they thought fit out of the booty. He diminished nothing of their equipage, or of the attentions and respect formerly paid them, and allowed larger pensions for their maintenance than they had before. But the noblest and most royal part of their usage was, that he treated these illustrious prisoners according to their virtue and character.\\"Dimock, 94 Although Darius's wife was renowned for her beauty, \\"Alexander, esteeming it more kingly to govern himself than to conquer his enemies, sought no intimacy with any of them.\\"Dimock, 95 The painting focuses on a misunderstanding involving Sisygambis, Darius's mother, which was not mentioned by Plutarch, but was recounted by several late Classical writers, among them Arrian, Valerius Maximus and Quintus Curtius Rufus. According to Quintus Curtius's History of Alexander the Great, Alexander went to the women's tent accompanied only by Hephaestion, counselor to the king and his intimate friend since the two had been children.Richter Sisygambis mistook the taller Hephaestion for Alexander, and knelt before him to plead for mercy. When her error was realized, Alexander magnanimously said that Hephaestion, too, was Alexander; this assuaged Sisygambis's embarrassment over her confusion, and served as a compliment to his friend.Dunkerton, et al, 109 Painting The composition preserves this ambiguity, and reflects the confusion of Sisygambis.Salomon, 846 Generally the scholarship is in agreement that Alexander is the young man in red, who gestures as if in the act of speaking while referring to Hephaestion at his left, though some historians dispute that interpretation and reverse the two figures' identities.Salomon, 846 The continued uncertainty as to their correct identification is taken as evidence of Veronese's \\"pictorial intelligence.\\"Salomon, 846 Detail of the central groups, with the family of Darius being presented to Alexander and Hephaestion. While honoring the spirit of the story, Veronese took liberties with his interpretation of the narrative, which in the painting occurs in a palatial hall, not a tent.Salomon, 846Richter The splendid wardrobe is that of the Venice in which Veronese lived, rather than ancient Greece or the Far East.RichterRuskin, 166 It has long been supposed that Veronese inserted portraits of his contemporaries into the painting, as was customary in Venetian history painting.RichterSalomon, 846 While it has been suggested that the figures were modeled after members of the Pisani family,Richter for whose estate the picture was made, it has alternatively been proposed that the kneeling girls are Veronese's daughters, and the courtier who presents them is the artist's self-portrait.Ruskin, 166 Another interpretation has Veronese appearing in the form of the man standing behind Alexander, while it has been suggested that it is the patron, Francesco Pisani, who presents the family to Alexander.Salomon, 846 Recently art historian Nicholas Penny has written that the painting's characterizations of cultivated nobility were based on no particular models, and were products of the artist's imagination.Salomon, 846 The picture's theatrical design places the most prominent figures in a shallow foreground stage. Immediately behind them are a diverting company of pages, halberdiers, dwarfs, dogs and monkeys, and in the further distance looms an architectural screen, an arched promenade parallel to the picture plane and supporting more spectators. These are pictorial preferences typical of Veronese, with the placement of figures and edifices reinforcing a processional character.Dunkerton, et al, 111 The curves of the distant arches echo the movement of the supplicated foreground figures, while the gesture of Sisygambis corresponds to and is reinforced by the verticals of the central fountain; the architectural geometry organizes the movement of the figures.Dunkerton, et al, 111 Analysis of the canvas has shown that it was a type favored by Veronese, with an arrangement of threads creating a diagonal twill pattern.Dunkerton, et al, 268 While he often preferred to paint on lightly colored grounds, for The Family of Darius before Alexander, as with many of his larger paintings, Veronese prepared the canvas only with plain gesso.Dunkerton, et al, 271Dunkerton, et al, 286 Though he routinely made numerous preparatory sketches, Veronese made major revisions while working on The Family of Darius before Alexander, including painting out a balcony with figures directly behind the main group, and adding lightly sketched horses and figures to the left background, perhaps as an afterthought.Dunkerton, et al, 286 Provenance and assessment The Family of Darius before Alexander was the only painting mentioned by Goethe in the account of his 1786 visit to Venice.Salomon, 845 He admired the painting during his stay at the Palazzo Pisani Moretta, and repeated the legend that the picture was painted by Veronese in gratitude for the Pisanis' hospitality.Salomon, 845 Supposedly the enormous canvas was painted at the villa in secret, and rolled up and left under a bed when the artist departed;Salomon, 845Ruskin, 166 the account has since been regarded as fanciful.Salomon, 845 According to recent scholarship, the painting was first owned by Francesco Pisani, and housed at the Villa Pisani in Montagnana, a building designed by Palladio.Salomon, 845 The canvas was probably moved to Venice after 1629, when the Pisani family purchased a palace on the Grand Canal.Salomon, 846 It was so esteemed that in 1664 agents of Christina, Queen of Sweden attempted to negotiate its purchase with the Venetian ambassador to Rome.Ilchman, et al, 69 The asking price of 5,000 ducats was considered excessive, and effectively discouraged all prospective buyers.Ilchman, et al, 69 As a result, copies of the painting were in demand, one of which was valued by its owner at 80 ducats.Ilchman, et al, 71 Charles Lock Eastlake, the director of the National Gallery, examined the painting in Venice on October 14, 1856.Dimock, 96 At a time when the British Empire would have found the painting's idealizations reflective of its presumptions, and after four years of negotiations, the museum bought the painting for 13,650 pounds.Dimock, 96 The price was thought exorbitant, and in July 1857 the purchase was debated in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, when Lord Elcho attacked the painting as a \\"second- rate specimen.\\"Dimock, 96Salomon, 845 John Ruskin called it \\"the most precious Paul Veronese in the world.\\"Ruskin, 165 Henry James wrote in 1882: > You may walk out of the noon-day dusk of Trafalgar Square in November, and > in one of the chambers of the National Gallery see the family of Darius > rustling and pleading and weeping at the feet of Alexander.

It was published during Spain's Golden Age, and is a tragedy about a misunderstanding which leads to the kidnapping and torture of an innocent woman. Plot Don Diego, a womanizing knight, falls in love with the beautiful Do√±a In√©s, wife of Don Alonso. Her poor neighbor takes notice and borrows a dress from the lady under the pretense of needing it to wear to a wedding. She then hires a prostitute who resembles In√©s to pose as her in order to have sexual relations with Diego in exchange for gifts. When it comes time to return the dress, they end the arrangement. Diego approaches In√©s to ask why she broke off their relationship, which confuses her greatly, until he mentions that she always wore the dress she is wearing at the moment when they were together. The dress is the one that she lent to the neighbor, so she realizes that he must have been tricked, and seeks help from the Mayor, who sees to it that the two women involved are punished. Diego, embarrassed but still in love with In√©s, seeks help from a Moorish necromancer, who gives him a candle shaped like the object of his unrequited love. When he lights the candle, a demon will possess In√©s, forcing her to come to his bedchamber and submit to him. He is warned not to extinguish the candle before she is back in her own bed or she will die. Diego begins to use the candle while Don Alonso is out of town on business. In√©s is conscious of what is happening, but doesn't understand it and thinks she is having vivid nightmares. One night she is discovered walking in a trance through the street in only a shirt by the Mayor and her brother, Don Francisco. They follow her and discover what Diego has been up to. He warns them not to extinguish the candle until she is back in her own bed. She returns to her room and awakens, surrounded by strange men who work for the Mayor, and is distraught with fear and guilt when she learns what has been happening to her. Diego is taken to the authorities and is never seen again. Her brother, husband, and sister-in-law, convinced that In√©s is guilty of adultery and has therefore brought dishonor upon the family, kidnap her and take her to Seville, where they hole her up inside a chimney in a place so small she is unable to stand or sit, but must crouch. They leave a tiny window to allow her to breathe and eat paltry meals, so that she will die very slowly. She is left here for six years, surrounded by trash and excrement, without light or the ability to lie down. She never gives up her faith in God and constantly prays for death or release, and is further tormented by her inability to celebrate the sacraments. Finally, a woman moves in next door into a room with sufficiently close proximity to the chimney to hear the lamentations of In√©s. She asks who the woman is, and In√©s tells her the story of how she came to be held captive. The next day the woman seeks help from the Mayor and Archbishop, who promptly go to the house of Alonso and Francisco and tear down the wall. In√©s is now blind, having lost her sight due to never seeing light, her hair tangled and covered with lice, her body covered in open wounds infested with worms. The Archbishop sends the three evil relatives to prison, and they are later condemned to death by hanging. In√©s is cured and restored to her former beauty, though she never regains her sight, and enters a convent, where she spends the rest of her days.

The species is solely known from the Early Eocene sediments exposed in northeast Washington state, United States. It is the only species belonging to the extinct section Republica. Taxonomy Acer republicense is known from a single specimen which was recovered from an outcrop of the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic. The section Stewarta contains only the species A. republicense. The Klondike Mountain Formation preserves an upland temperate flora which was first interpreted as being microthermal, however further study has shown the flora to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the Klondike Mountain formation is a mixed conifer‚Äìbroadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm. A. republicense is one of a number of Acer species described from the Republic site by Wolfe and Tanai. Like the associated species such as A. hillsi, A. stonebergae and A. toradense, Acer republicense is only known from the samara fossils. This contrasts the species A. washingtonense which is known from fossil samaras and leaves. The species was described from a solitary part and counterpart type specimen, the holotype samara, number UAPC S5414A, B, which is currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. The specimen was studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. republicense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name republicense is in recognition of the type locality in Republic, Washington, and as the only species in the section Republica, the section name is a derivation of republicense. Description The general shape of the A. republicense nutlet is elliptic with a pair of raised flanges which run the length of the slightly inflated nutlet forming a medial ridge. The overall length of the samara is approximately and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a 50¬∞ attachment angle. The wing venation is formed by five veins that merge along the upper margin of the wing before acutely dichotomizing and anastomosing in the wing membrane. This vein structure is more complex then that of other Klondike Mountain formation species, which are related to the modern A. spicatum. The overall structure of A. republicense is indicative of a possible relationship to the Acer sect. Macrantha species.

Ramsey is an Associate Professor Emerita at the University of California, San Diego. She is an alumna of Gallaudet University and is former instructor at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska. Ramsey's research has focused on the sociolinguistics of deaf and signing communities in the US and Mexico. Publications Ramsey is the author of two books, Deaf Children in Public Schools and The People Who Spell, both published by Gallaudet University Press. She co-authored the report titled Deaf Students as Reader and Writers: A Mixed-mode Research Approach with Carol Padden. *Deaf Children in Public Schools is part of the Sociolinguistic in Deaf Communities series. This book profiles three American deaf children in the second grade. As many deaf students are being placed in mainstream public education in the US, Ramsey wanted to observe these children in different classroom settings; comparing all-deaf classes with mainstreamed general education classes. Ramsey's research suggests that deaf and hard-of- hearing students perform better educationally when they were in an all-deaf classroom. This is because they have full access to the course content in a visual language and the classroom environment is more accommodating to their needs. *The People Who Spell deals with the Escuela Nacional pare Sorodundos (Mexican National School for the Deaf). This school was opened by the Mexican government in the 1860s in order to educate the deaf citizens of Mexico. The language policy of the school was to teach the students using spoken Spanish, with the goal of them learning to lipread (i.e., the oral approach). (The school closed in the 1970s.) Although the students that attended the Escuela Nacional did not use Lengua De Senas Mexicana (LSM or Mexican Sign Language) to communicate, as many modern-day deaf Mexicans do, they did pride themselves on using el deletreo, or LSM fingerspelling. The book interviews students who had attended the Escuela Nacional and they tell about their experiences at the school. One interviewee, Maria de los angeles Beodlla, expressed her feeling that when she was going to school her classmates and her were more cultured and educated then today's deaf people in Mexico. In analyzing these interviews, Ramsey identified a common theme, a sense of disappointment in how modern-day Mexico has failed its deaf citizens.\\"Claire L Ramsey, The People Who Spell. Recommend to Your Friends and Book Club.\\" Book Review  Books Online  TheReadingRoom.com. Web. 15 Nov. 2011. . *Deaf Students as Reader and Writers: A Mixed-mode Research Approach was co-authored with Carol Padden. In this report they focused on the reading and writing skills of 135 deaf or hard-of-hearing school-aged children. Of these children, 83 attend a residential school for the deaf, and the other 52 attended a public school that had the deaf and hard-of-hearing program. Ramsey and Padden observed these children to determine if they learned how to read and write better in a residential school or public school. They found that there are other factors that contribute to a deaf child successfully learning to read and write; particularly, whether or not the child's parents or family members are also deaf. Children from deaf families tended to attend the deaf residential schools. Age detection and the length of time that they attended school were determining factors to the children's literacy successful, as well.\\"The People Who Spell.\\" Gallaudet University Press.

This teacher uses American Sign Language as a way of communication at the school she works for, where she has taught for about thirty-five years. The teacher is a native signer of ASL and she signs in her classroom. Her teaching strategies have helped her students become more interactive in the classroom.Ramsey, Claire L., and David H.

In the article, Ramsey explains that many causes of deafness are related to the culture, and that in Mexico they are trying to cure deafness because they say that the child needs to be treated right away or rehabilitated. In Mexico they are trying to make these children part of the community. They want these children to be integrated into the hearing society that they live in.Ramsey, Claire L., and Jose Noriega. \\"Ninos Milagrizados: Language Attitudes, Deaf Education, and Miracle Cures in Mexico.\\" Web. 15 Nov. 2011. .

The chapter \\"Reading Ability in Signing Deaf Children\\" was co-authored by Ramsey and Padden. In this chapter, they discuss how deaf children learn to read; describing that knowledge of specific ASL linguistic structure correlates to reading achievement. Children that perform better on reading tests are those who have the ability to write down words that are fingerspelled to them and then are able to translate them into signs; which is often seen in children who grew up being exposed to sign language.Google Books.

In 1854 he served as brigadier general in the volunteer Mounted Militia of New Mexico (Territory) formed for the purpose of protecting communities against Native American attacks. Prior to the Battle of Glorieta Pass, he was a Union field and staff Colonel in the Civil War, serving as commander of the 3rd New Mexico Volunteer Infantry and as commander of the Hatch's Ranch military post. He represented San Miguel County in four of the six Assemblies of the Territorial Legislature between 1855-1861 and served as House Speaker and as Council President. Jos√© was one of the founding members of the Historical Society of New Mexico and was a founding associate in the incorporation of the Montezuma Copper Mining Company of Santa F√©, New Mexico the New Mexican Railway Company p.110 and the New Mexico Wool Manufacturing Company.id. New Mexican Printing Company. Chpt.26. Local and Special Laws of NM..., pp.804-808 Early years Gallegos was born April 13, 1828 in San Jos√© (San Miguel County), First Mexican Republic (by the time of his death, the New Mexico Territory of the United States). He was the son of Jos√© Fernando de Jesus Gallegos and Maria Juliana Padilla. He was raised in an area known as the San Miguel del Vado Land Grant. The land was originally applied for in 1794 as one of the gen√≠zaros community grants being established on frontiers for the purpose of buffering larger towns, such as Santa F√©, against raids. Twenty-five percent of the original applicants were gen√≠zaros. Following a period of about 20 years of development to meet the grant requirements, individual parcels of land were allotted by don Pedro Bautista Pino in the name of Governor Fernando Chac√≥n's verbal order of March 12, 1803. This vicinity of the Pecos River valley was a long time meeting place for trade between the Plains and Pueblo tribes, a passage through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains for the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley to access the plains for buffalo hunting, as well as passage for the later Spanish explorers, frontier traders, buffalo hunters, Indian fighters, the Santa Fe Trail, Civil War armies, and later still for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway portion of a southern route of a transcontinental railroad system.Herbert E. Bolton. Coronado: Knight of the Pueblos and Plains. Kessinger Publishing, LLC 2008 The traditional Mexican buffalo hunters of the area were known as ciboleros. San Miguel del Vado was an early frontier outpost serving to protect larger cities such as Santa F√© from marauding Plains Indians. A customs house and soldiers stationed in the area also served to prevent smuggling and tax evasion related to trade along the Santa F√© Trail. San Miguel del Vado soldiers also served to protect expansion into northeastern New Mexico, and the establishment of later Spanish land grants in that area, such as the Las Vegas Land Grant, due in part to population pressures in San Miguel del Vado. San Miguel del Vado had become the administrative headquarters for the northeastern plains region of New Mexico early. These environmental influences contributed to Jos√©'s decision to join the military and participate in New Mexico Territorial politics. Gallegos was married to Josefa Gutierres, at an age four months shy of his 16th birthday, on November 18, 1843 at San Miguel del Bado Church by the Father Jos√© Francisco Leyba. Area censuses indicate that they had six children. The 1860 Census for San Miguel County indicates a family of four children at that date: Ladislado, Bernabe, Maria Viviana and Juan de Dios. The 1870 Colonias de San Jose Census indicates two additional children, Silviano and Guadalupe. Political career At age 23, Gallegos was elected and served as sheriff of San Miguel County, New Mexico from September 1851 through September 1853.Larry D. Ball, Desert Lawmen: The High Sheriffs of New Mexico and Arizona Territories, 1846-1912 The Sheriff's office was located in Las Vegas, NM. 11 years after Jose Guadalupe's death, railway work crews struggled to build the line between La Junta and Raton, and the first Santa Fe train entered New Mexico December 7, 1878. According to Ralph Twitchell, \\"without exception, in the days of construction of the Santa Fe railway into the Southwest, there was no town which harbored a more disreputable gang of gamblers, desperadoes, and outlaws than did Las Vegas. They controlled, for a while, the local police officers, and the dance halls, and public resorts were the scenes of many shooting affrays and robberies. In the new town, in the immediate vicinity and in front of the present Castenada hotel, were located some of the most disreputable saloons, dance-halls, and resorts ever in frontier days. The gambling houses never closed and the gambling fraternity did about as they pleased. It finally became necessary to organize a committee of one hundred for the safety of the better classes and visitors to the place. Several desperadoes were summarily dealt with, taken from the jail or from their resorts and hung. Notice was served upon every 'undesirable' to leave forthwith and in this manner the town was rid of as desperate a gang of cutthroats and \\"bad men\\" as ever congregated in one place in the Southwest.\\" At the time that Gallegos held the sheriff's office, San Miguel County included the present Guadalupe County, which was created from the southern portion of San Miguel County February 26, 1891 by an act of the New Mexico Territorial Legislature. Jos√© Guadalupe ran for the council (Senate) of the 3rd NM Territorial Assembly in 1853,The Santa Fe Weekly Gazette, August 20, 1853 p. 2 (English) & p.3 (Spanish) from Library of Congress, Chronicling America (accessed 07-07-2015) but was not elected. In that race he was on the ticket for the county of Santa Fe, presented by the friends of Governor William Carr Lane, who ran against the Democrat, Padre Jos√© Manuel Gallegos, as Territorial delegate to the U.S. Congress, on the same ticket.\\"Next Legislature,\\" The Santa Fe Weekly Gazette September 03, 1853 p. 2 (accessed 07-07-2015) Jos√© Guadalupe was later successfully elected, and served in four of the six Assemblies of the Territorial Legislature between 1855‚Äì1861. A large majority of the members of council and house were naturally Native New Mexicans. About 20 family names include a very large majority of the membership for the whole period, and a few wealthy and influential families in each county controlled the election of representatives and all other matters of the territorial government, with only the slightest interest of the masses. Yet the legislators were as a rule intelligent and patriotic men, rarely accused of corruption and probably superior in respect to representatives of later years. All proceedings were carried out in the Spanish language and also in English translations. Gallegos represented San Miguel County in the 5th (1855-6), 8th (1858-9), 9th (1859‚Äì60), and 10th (1860-1) Assemblies. He served as the House speaker in the 8th Assembly and as Council president in the 9th and 10th Assemblies. While in the legislature, he incorporated with like- minded individuals of notoriety, the Historical Society of New Mexico (Dec. 15, 1859), the New Mexican Railway Company (Feb 2, 1860), the Montezuma Copper Mining Company of Santa F√©, New Mexico (Jan. 26, 1861), and the New Mexico Wool Manufacturing Company (Jan. 30, 1861). Historical Society of New Mexico The Historical Society of New Mexico was initiated on December 15, 1859. A committee of five was appointed for the purpose of framing a Constitution and By Laws for the intended society. The committee members were Charles P. Clever, United States Marshal in Santa Fe; Facundo Pino, the brother of Nicolas Pino; W.J. Howard; Jos√© Guadalupe Gallegos; and Merrill Ashurst, Clever's sometime law partner. They were to report back with their recommendations a week later. On December 22 the report was read and adopted as amended. However, after protracted debates and on several articles, a new committee was appointed to reframe the Constitution. The second committee consisted of Col. John B. Grayson, Major J. L. Donaldson, Hon. K. Benedict, Dr. W. J. Sloan and C. P. Clever Esq. Clever was the only member from the previous committee that was retained. The new committee submitted its report December 26, 1859 endeavoring to \\"form an instrument, as plain, simple and comprehensible as possible, and in which every member of the committee concurs. At the same time, it acknowledges its indebtedness to the labors of the previous Committee, several of whose ideas it has adopted. ...Although the subject of the By Laws was not referred to the Committee, it has drawn up a number, to facilitate the organization of the Society which are herewith submitted and unanimously recommended.\\" The report was adopted and the society now had a constitution.New Mexico Historical Review Vol.18, January 1943, \\"Historical Society Minutes, 1859-1863\\" University of New Mexico It remained for the society to legally incorporate within the state, which it did with the help of Gallegos. The Act to Incorporate the Historical Society of New Mexico was passed February 2, 1860 and signed by Jos√© G. Gallegos as Territorial Legislature Council President. The Society suspended it activities in 1863 due to the Civil War. American Civil War Following the outbreak of the Civil War on April 12, 1861 and Lincoln's call for a volunteer army from each state, Governor Henry Connelly issued a bilingual proclamation of August 9, 1861, calling for volunteers as follows. \\"Citizens of New Mexico, your Territory has been invaded; the integrity of your soil has been attacked, the property of peaceful and industrious citizens has been destroyed or converted to the use of the invaders, and the enemy is already at your doors. You cannot, you must not, hesitate to take up arms in defense of your homes, firesides and families. Your manhood calls upon you to be on the alert and to be vigilant in the protection of the soil of your birth, where repose the sacred remains of your ancestors and which was left by them as a rich heritage to you, if you have the valor to defend it. I feel that I appeal not in vain to those who love the land of their fathers; a land that has been the scene of heroic acts, and deeds of noble daring in wars no more patriotic than that for which preparations are now being made...\\" Five regiments of volunteers, a regiment of militia, a battalion of militia, and three independent cavalry companies were raised, averaging 97% Hispanics. On August 26, 1861, Gallegos was commissioned as a staff and field colonel in charge of the Third Regiment (1,000 men), New Mexico Volunteers, in the Army of the United States. He was described by NM Department commander Canby as one among a group of the most efficient volunteer officers.The War of the Rebellion Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I, Vol. 4. Operations in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona... United States War Dept. pg. 85. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1880 The American Civil War saw a large influx of colonels as the rank was commonly held by those who commanded a regiment. Since most regiments were formations of the separate states and were quickly raised, the colonels in command were known by the title \\"Colonel of Volunteers,\\" in contrast to Regular Army colonels who held ranks from the \\"old school\\" of the professional army before the Civil War. The Department of New Mexico, which at this time included the Territory of Arizona, had the most officers of Hispanic descent, serving in nineteen units of the Union army. 157 Hispanic officers have been identified, to include Lt. Colonel Diego Archuleta, Colonel Miguel E. Pino, commander the 2nd NMVI, Colonel Jose G. Gallegos, commander of the 3rd NMVI, and Lt. Colonel Francisco Perea, commanding the Perea Militia Battalion. The remaining NMVI commands were: 1st: Colonel Kit Carson; 4th: Colonel Gabriel Ren√© Paul; 5th: Colonel Benjamin S. Roberts; and in addition, Graydon's Independent Cavalry Company of NM volunteers was under the command of Captain James Graydon. Many units of the regular army were transferred from the western states to the East, and 1/3 of all officers in the Union army resigned in order to enlist with the Confederacy. Only four companies of dragoons and the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen would be left to represent the regular army in New Mexico. These were augmented by volunteers who provided much of the manpower for the army in the territory. Colonel Canby concluded, soon after taking command of the Department of New Mexico, that Fort Union be designated the general depot for the distribution of all supplies shipped in via the Santa Fe Trail, except medical provisions, to the several posts and commands in the department. He correctly deduced that the Texas Confederates must attack along one of the rivers, either the Rio Grande, Pecos, or Canadian. At least one company of dragoons, detached from the garrison at Fort Union, was kept posted at Hatch's Ranch to protect that area and scout south and east for Indians and Texans who might threaten the settlements. The troops at Hatch's Ranch were directed, if threatened by a superior force, to retreat to Fort Union rather than fight. Hatch's Ranch was considered to be a strategic location in the area because it was close to the Pecos River settlements, near the Fort Smith route to Albuquerque, and in an area through which Comanches and Kiowas often entered the settled regions of New Mexico. The ranch became a military outpost in the department in 1856. Gallegos was made Post Commander at Hatch's Ranch on Nov 22, 1861. In a letter to Colonel William Chapman, commander of Ft. Union, from Colonel Canby via 2nd Lt. A.L. Anderson announcing the governor's appointment of Gallegos as Colonel, Jos√© Maria Chaves of Abiquiu as Lt. Colonel, and Manuel Baca of Socorro and Joseph Cumming of Santa Fe as Majors, the Hatch's Ranch assignment was described: \\"...instructing the Commanding Officer to keep his scouts constantly in the field and to extend their operations to the Canadian and Red River on the East and down the Pecos far enough to give timely warning of the approach of troops from either quarter. Instruct him also to endeavor to establish friendly relations with the Comanches and induce them to bring in information of any movements on the plains.\\" The unit was also under special order 187, Nov 9, 1861 to construct a road between Las Vegas and Fort Union. Another source lists Lieutenant Colonel Jose Maria Valdez, Major Faustino B. y Ulibarri and Major Louis M. Vaca as officers under Gallegos' command. The 3rd NM Volunteer Infantry regiment, like the other volunteer organizations of 1861‚Äì62, was hastily recruited to assist in repelling the Texas invaders. As originally organized it was composed of fourteen companies, several of them mounted, which were mustered into the U. S. service at Fort Union and Albuquerque, from August 30 to October 10, 1861, for six months. Captain Vigil's company was broken up October 11, 1861; Ortiz', Lovato's and Romero's December 20, 1861, and Mortimore's February 28, 1862, the enlisted men being distributed among the remaining companies. The regiment was mustered out at different dates from March 9 to 20, 1862, by reason of expiration of term of service. Seven companies of the 3rd, under command of Lieutent-Colonel Valdez, were stationed at Fort Craig, forming part of the force concentrated at that post to oppose the further advance of Sibley's Texan brigade. This portion of the regiment participated in the battle of Valverde, where it was employed chiefly as a reserve force and in supporting McRae's and Hall's batteries. The picked company commanded by Captain Mortimore especially distinguished itself, its commander being three times wounded. The loss of the 3rd in this action was 6 killed, 4 wounded and 1 missing. Its term of service having expired, the regiment was mustered out shortly after this engagement.The Union Army (1908) Vol. 4, p.459 Gallegos served a six-month enlistment in the Army of the United States from August 26, 1861, until March 6, 1862. This was just prior to the Battle of Glorieta Pass, fought from March 26 to 28, 1862, the decisive battle of the New Mexico Campaign. Nonprofessional troops, as opposed to regulars or professional army soldiers, were recruited by both sides in the Civil War for a specific purpose, such as Sibley's campaign, and for a set period of time. The Civil War in New Mexico ended in August 1862, when the last of the Confederates were routed by the California Column. Even though his enlistment period was over, by law, officers in the army could resign their commissions by simply submitting a letter of resignation to the department commander, who forwarded it to the secretary of war for approval by the president. As soon as a letter of acceptance was returned, the officer was free from his obligations to the Union Army. Enlisted men, however, enjoyed no such privilege. They enlisted for a specified period of time and could not resign. Later years Following the Civil War, at age 34, Gallegos seems to have dropped into relative anonymity during the five years preceding to his death. He was only thirty-nine years old when he was reported as drowned following a mysterious carriage accident on May 18, 1867. Simon Delgado, age 51 died June 20, 1867 from dropsy and his cousin Miguel E. Pino, age 45 also died from stomach cancer within 36 hours of Simon. Community resolutions were published in Santa Fe, saluting the deaths of all three men. Translations from Spanish follow: Resolved: That we deeply deplore the loss that our society has suffered from the deaths of Hons. Jos√© Guadalupe Gallegos, Simon Delgado and Miguel E. Pino, and that in making this manifesto, our sentiments demonstrate the esteem that we had for our noble countrymen, now deceased, for their brilliant careers in our age, for their lives, principally upon maturing into men, which were such that it is not possible that we pass in silence, without doing full justice to their memories.

In addition, he is notable for having been a large contributor to political campaigns for the Democratic Party as well as being a voice calling for money to get out of politics. He has called for serious electoral reform and public financing of elections. Hiatt has been consistently praised by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig for his stance on electoral reform. Stride Rite Hiatt was the son of a Lithuanian immigrant. A graduate of the Class of 1944, Arnold attended Worcester Academy for twelve months straight in order to join the U. S. Army in the Second World War. After college, he began as a shoe salesman and worked himself up the corporate ladder. He joined Stride Rite in 1967 when it acquired a children's shoe company named Blue Star, when sales were $35 million a year. In 1968, Hiatt became president; by 1992, Stride Rite was earning more than $600 million. Hiatt was able to anticipate changes in consumer preferences for footwear, and adapted to major changes by acquiring firms with in-demand products: Hiatt pioneered socially conscious methods such as opening a company sponsored day care center in 1971, at a time when such a move was considered \\"radically countercultural.\\" In 1986, smoking of cigarettes, cigars and pipes was banned from the corporation. And his firm provides scholarships for 40 inner-city youth to attend Harvard University. According to The New York Times, the company has achieved a consistent return on investment to place it among the \\"top 1 percent of companies\\" listed on the New York Stock Exchange with compounded annual growth of 46 percent. Stride Rite was acquired by Payless ShoeSource in 2007. Advocacy of electoral reform According to Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, in 1996 Hiatt advocated to then- president Bill Clinton that the president work hard to try to end \\"private funding of public elections\\", but Hiatt was repudiated by Clinton. In 2007, Hiatt wrote: Hiatt has urged passage of the Senate Fair Elections Now Act introduced by Senators Dick Durbin and Arlen Specter, which is a bipartisan proposal to raise a \\"large number of small donations to show their credibility with the public\\" before qualifying for public funding for their campaigns.

The cave was within the country of the Krowathunkooloong clan of the Gunaikurnai nation. The deep cave system has an overhanging cliff that creates a rock shelter at the entrance facing the river. Excavations in the 1980s carried out by archaeologist Paul Ossa and a team from LaTrobe University found stone artefacts, and other signs of occupation that were dated to almost 20,000 BP. New Guinea II is one of three major cave systems that have so far been investigated in the middle Snowy River area, along with New Guinea Cave (NG-1), and Nuigini Namba Fav Cave (NG-5, NG-6. New Guinea II is largely joint-controlled, although the entrance area is formed along bedding planes and has a large chamber and passage with a perennial stream and several entrances. Finger or tool marks made in the dried mud on the cave wall are thought to be of prehistoric Aboriginal origin and are similar to those of Koonalda Cave on the Nullarbor Plain. New Guinea II is the first place where such markings have been recorded in Victoria. Animal origin has been proposed for the wall markings, although many appear to be in regular patterns, including circles and diagonal crosses. They are also generally on smoother parts of the walls and some are in now- dark and inaccessible parts of the cave.Australia: The Land Where Time Began, A biography of the Australian continent, New Guinea 2 Cave The cave is used by Bent Wing bats, which congregate in the large chamber, deep inside the cave.Sites of Geological and Geomorphological Significance in East Gippsland, Victoria (1981) by Neville Rosengren, M.S McRae-Williams The cave has been occupied intermittently for more than 20,000 years (21,900 +900/-800 BP and 4,660 +/- 110 BP) with a small, but constant amount of lithic material and bone artefacts, as well as evidence of a hearth on a dry floor near the stream within the cave.

The artefact assemblage is similar to that at the nearby Cloggs Cave in Buchan, and in conjunction with Birrigai in the ACT they represent a general signature of human occupation and resource exploitation of the southeastern uplands during the Pleistocene. This reveals a non-intensive use of caves and shelters and consumption of local fauna. In comparison, southwestern Tasmanian Pleistocene sites appear to have a different signature of cave occupation and the primacy of a single vertebrate resource.Paul Ossa, Brendan Marshall, Cathie Webb 1995, New Guinea II Cave:A Pleistocene site on the Snowy River, Victoria, Archaeology in Oceania Volume 30, Issue 1, Article first published online: 14 NOV 2014 See also * Cloggs Cave * Buchan Caves References ;Notes * Josephine Flood, Archaeology of the Dreamtime, J.

In July 2013, Bloomberg announced that Fancy had raised $53 million in funding, bringing the company's valuation to approximately $600 million. In February 2015, Fancy raised a $20 million Series D strategic funding round which was led by Mexico's Carlos Slim Domit and the CCC holding company.  History   Thingd  Thingd is the parent company of Fancy. Thingd is short for ‚ÄúThing daemon‚Äù. In a 2010 TechCrunch article, CEO Joseph Einhorn summarized the company's mission by stating that, ‚Äúwe want to build a database of everything in the world.‚Äù Thingd aims to be the object layer in the web, the platform that identifies images and collects metadata around everything from Gucci sunglasses to comic book collectibles.  Creation and Growth  Fancy was originally set up as ‚Äúan invitation-only photo blog where more than 5,000 tastemakers and celebrities upload and tag images of their possessions, as well as the baubles they'd like to own‚Äù. It has since then opened to the public. In October 2012, comScore announced that Fancy had grown 25% since its launch and was estimated to be worth US$100 million. As of July 2013, Fancy is valued at approximately $600 million. In February 2014, Olivia Palermo, with Fancy, started an e-commerce website. Purchase of fancy.com  Fancy purchased Fancy.com in June 2013 and the company was subsequently rebranded from \\"The Fancy\\" to \\"Fancy.\\"  Usage  The Fancy userbase is split relatively 50-50 between Indian and International users. The main age group on Fancy consists of 24- to 35-year- olds. Visitors from the US make up for 47% of Fancy.com's visits, with 53% coming from an international following.

Whenever someone clicks on their referral link and makes a purchase, the original user who posted the referral link will get a 2 percent cut in the form of credit in his/her account. Fancy created a dashboard that is specifically designed for users to keep track of all the earnings that were made through referral links. Founder Joseph Einhorn expressed in an interview with VentureBeat that \\"the goal is to evolve the way social commerce operates\\". He added that the company wants \\"to reward the users who create value for us by curating favorite items and helping others to discover great new things\\".  Finances   Revenue Sources  There is no advertising on Fancy, but Fancy allows external merchants to sell their products on the site. Brands and retailers bid to sell items that are fancied. The seller then sets a price based on the demand, or number of fancies, that an item has. After Fancy approves the item, users can then make their transaction on the website. In return for selling other merchants‚Äô products, Fancy takes a small commission of every purchase that is made through the website.  Funding  On June 9, 2009, Fancy received a combined $2 million from angel investors Jim Pallotta (Board Member and owner of the Boston Celtics), Esther Dyson, and Allen & Company. In May 2010, Fancy completed its Series A round which amassed a total of $6 million from various investors, including Art Samberg, Jeff Samberg, Maynard Webb, Bob Pittman, Twitter creator Jack Dorsey (Board Member), and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (Board Member). Fancy secured a $10 million investment in November 2011 from Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, bringing the company's valuation to $100 million. In July 2013 Fancy closed a $53 million funding round from, among others, American Express, Len Blavatnik, and Will Smith. The funding brought the company's estimated value to $600 million and is being used to expand the company which, in 2013, was processing $3 million in monthly revenue. In September 2013 Fancy secured an investment round of $7 million from, among others, Richard C. Perry, owner of Barneys New York, and his son David Perry, who works at Fancy. In February 2015, Fancy raised a $20 million Series D strategic funding round which was led by Mexico's Carlos Slim Domit and the CCC holding company. Fancy noted that it would use the funding to \\"continue to build out its technology platform and execute on new key strategic partnerships‚Äù.  Acquisitions  As of August 2012, Apple was in talks to acquire Fancy. Apple wanted to secure a role for themselves in the growing e-commerce market. Although there is no guarantee that the acquisition will happen and the price that Apple proposed to pay for Fancy is unknown. Apple is not known for making \\"big, splashy acquisitions\\" but Fancy could give Apple a \\"clear route to converting people's interest in an object into a sale\\". The acquisition was never completed. In February 2013 Fancy acquired the online artisanal foods vendor Samplrs.com in an attempt to bolster the company's food business.  Partnership with Google+  In February 2013, Google+ partnered with Fancy allowing users to buy and share goods directly through its social platform in a method similar to Facebook's Gifts.

With the deteriorating global situation, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia has said that achieving an average growth rate of 9 per cent in the next five years is not possible. The final growth target has been set at 9% by the endorsement of plan at the National Development Council (NDC) meeting held in New Delhi. \\"It is not possible to think of an average of 9 per cent (in 12th Plan). I think somewhere between 8 and 8.5 per cent is feasible\\", Mr Ahluwalia said on the sidelines of a conference of State Planning Boards and departments. The approached paper for the 12th Plan, approved last year, talked about an annual average growth rate of 9 per cent. \\"When I say feasible...that will require major effort. If you don't do that, there is no God given right to grow at 8 per cent. I think given that the world economy deteriorated very sharply over the last year...the growth rate in the first year of the 12th Plan (2012-13) is 6.5 to 7 per cent.\\" He also indicated that soon he would share his views with other members of the commission to choose a final number (economic growth target) to put before the country's NDC for its approval. Though the 12th Plan has taken off, it is yet to be formally approved. The Planning Commission set a deadline of September for taking the approval of the NDC. The council is expected to meet after July, subject to the convenience of the Prime Minister. It is mainly focused on health. The status of the 12th Plan is in question due to the dissolution of the Planning Commission. Poverty The government intends to reduce poverty by 10 per cent during the 12th Five-Year Plan. Mr Ahluwalia said, \\"We aim to reduce poverty estimates by 2 per cent annually on a sustainable basis during the Plan period\\". According to the Tendulkar methodology, the percentage of population below the poverty line was 29.8 per cent at the end of 2009‚Äì10. This number includes 33.8 per cent in the rural areas and 20.9 per cent in the urban areas. Earlier, addressing a conference of State Planning Boards and Planning departments, he said the rate of decline in poverty doubled during the 11th Plan. The commission had said, while using the Tendulkar poverty line, the rate of reduction in the five years between 2004‚Äì05 and 2009‚Äì10, was about 1.5 percentage points each year, which was twice that when compared to the period between 1993‚Äì95 to 2004‚Äì05.

Girolamo Mocetto (c. 1470 in Murano - after 1531 in Venice, Active 1490 - 1530)Entry on the Union List of Artist Names. First name also spelled Gerolamo, last name also spelled Moceto, Mozeto, Mozetto, Mozzetto, or Mozzetto. was an Italian Renaissance painter, engraver, and stained glass designer. He was heavily influenced by Domenico Morone, Giovanni Bellini, Bartolomeo Montagna, Cima da Conegliano, and especially Andrea Mantegna.Serena Romano. \\"Mocetto, Girolamo.\\" In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online (accessed December 14, 2011; subscription required). He is most important as an engraver,Boorsch 57 and his engravings of the compositions of others are his most successful prints.Levinson, 382  Life  Mocetto's family were glass painters. His exact date of birth is not known. Although it was long thought that he was born in the 1450s, more recent scholarship has found this to be due to a misread document. The birth date of c. 1470 was arrived at by taking the known dates of his 1494 marriageDate per Boorsch; the British Museum biography gives the date as 1493. and his grandfather's 1445 marriage and assuming that Mocetto and his father each married at age 20-25. He may well be the Hieronymo depentor (\\"painter Jerome\\") who joined the large team under Giovanni Bellini painting the council hall of the Doge's Palace, Venice in 1507, though he had probably been making engravings in a Bellini-esque style for many years before. In 1517 he painted the facade of a house in Verona; since the owners were also called Mocetto they may have been relatives. He is last recorded in August 1531, when he signed a will in Venice leaving his estate to his son Domenico. As this summary would indicate, primary sources about Mocetto's life are scant. While there is no record that he trained or lived outside of Venice, there are significant indications that he may have spent time in Mantua. Several impressions of the print Judith with the Head of Holofernes bear Mantuan watermarks, and the print itself closely resembles the work of Giulio Campagnola, who is recorded as being in that city in 1499.Boorsch 57-58 St Theodore and SS John and Paul, stained glass panels from Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, c. 1515  Work  None of Mocetto's works have been dated to before 1490, and the only clearly datable ones are illustrations, with no figures, in a book published in 1514, so little use in establishing a chronology of his style. A total of 17 engravings by his hand are extant, along with 10 paintings, and several stained glass panels.Boorsch 58 While Mocetto's paintings are \\"derivative in form and middling, at best, in quality,\\" his engravings are more substantial. They are generally large in size, with several of them being printed from multiple plates, and most appear to be reproductions of paintings, by himself or others.Levinson, 383 His style varies little: it is \\"undisciplined\\" and even \\"na√Øve\\", marked by a loose and free application of dense cross hatching. Judith with the Head of Holofernes is his best known print and is based (reversed) on a work by Mantegna known from other copies, probably of the 1490s, with the Venetian-style landscape background only added in a second state, perhaps several years later.Levinson, 386-389; Boorsch 57 In an impression in the British Museum he \\"pressed the ink on with a cloth to produce a patterned surface tone\\".Landau, 80-81 A group of engravings based on designs by Mantegna and his circle appear to precede a group using his own designs, and finally comes a group copying or reflecting the style of Giovanni Bellini.Levinson, 383-384 There are indications that, unlike other prints by Mantegna's circle after his designs, Mocetto's prints were not produced under the supervision of the master.Landau, 113-115 Of Mocetto's work in stained glass, his c.1515 panels for the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo are considered the most successful.

The situation raised important constitutional issues. The actual crisis cannot be understood as a question of law in the first place. It was part of a longer standing power struggle between opposition and government. O'Neill won that struggle and remained the facto in power after the court ruling. It laid the foundation for his dominance in the PNG political arena. Somare did not admit defeat. The 2012 election, however, gave a clear victory to O'Neill. Somare accepted the outcome and he even supported the election of O'Neill as prime minister. The conflict flared up again during the Peter O'Neill/Leo Dion government period from 2012 to 2017.

A previous attempt to mount a vote of no confidence by breakaway ministers and MPs led by Puka Temu had been unsuccessful. Somare's majority could only be confidently challenged if there was a revolt in his party, the National Alliance (NA). It was also vital that the Speaker would change sides, as he had obstructed previous attempts. When the speaker did so and allowed an open vote for a new government, the parties supporting the Somare government split. NA divided in a breakaway group itself under the leadership of Don Polye (21 MPs), opposed to a group that remained loyal to Sam Abal and Michael Somare (20 MPs).PNG National Alliance party suspends Abal http://www.pireport.org/articles/2011/07/26/png-national-alliance-party- suspends-abal Posted on 26 July 2011 Accessed 1 July 2018More ructions in PNG‚Äôs National Alliance.

This had large consequences in the ensuing court cases. The revolt proved successful. Peter O'Neill became the new Prime Minister with the support of 70 MPs out of a 109-member parliament. However, O'Neill's People's National Congress (PNC) had only six seats in parliament. PNC had supported the Somare government since 2007. Belden Namah and Mekere Morauta of the main opposition PNG party led the revolt, but they did not become prime minister. Namah, the leader of the opposition, became deputy Prime Minister. He had also been part of the Somare government. Don Polye, who had led the revolt in NA, became the Minister for Finance and the Treasury. He had been strongly tipped for the post of Prime Minister.Bill Standish PNG‚Äôs new prime minister: Peter O‚ÄôNeill.

Mekere Morauta on the contrary had been the prime opponent of the Somare government. He did not become involved in the ensuing struggles surrounding the legality of the first O'Neill government.

Available at: http://www.kch.com.pg/unfinished-business/ Accessed on: 6 November 2017 Legal battle The government of Somare/Abal was therefore not defeated by a motion of no confidence. In that case the position of O'Neill would have been unequivocally covered by law. It is puzzling that instead, the Speaker had allowed a motion to declare the post of Prime Minister vacant because of illness. That possibility was covered in the Constitution in section 142(5,c) on the grounds: \\"that two medical practitioners appointed by the National Authority responsible for the registration or licensing of medical practitioners have jointly reported in accordance with an Act of the Parliament that, in their professional opinions, the Prime Minister is unfit, by reason of physical or mental incapacity, to carry out the duties of his office.\\" Parliament had approached the Papua New Guinea Medical Board for such a mission to Singapore at the beginning of Somare's hospitalization.R.J.

The next possibility envisioned concerned the absence of a Member of Parliament, and because the PM is an MP in a Westminster parliamentary system, this is therefore applicable to the Prime Minister. The relevant section 104 (d) of the Constitution reads: \\"if he is absent, without leave of the Parliament, during the whole of three consecutive meetings of the Parliament unless Parliament decides to waive this rule upon satisfactory reasons being given\\". Somare had been absent since March but his reasons were accepted by parliament and he was granted leave until May 2012. Parliament then withdrew this leave. However, in early September Somare returned to PNG and declared that he was willing and able to finish his term of prime minister. On 6 September he made a brief appearance in the chamber and therefore the rule of missing three consecutive meetings no longer applied.R.J.

The Supreme Court came unequivocally down on the side of Somare. There was no legal vacancy in the office of Prime Minister when O'Neill was elected. The Speaker's decision to declare a vacancy in Somare's parliamentary seat in East Sepik was similarly unconstitutional and void. Somare should have been reinstated as Prime Minister. According to the Supreme court the facts had not been correctly stated and therefore a different legal provision was applicable. Anthony Latimer, PNG constitutional crisis.

Accessed on: 7 July 2018 The factual situation did not change: O'Neill remained in charge. The Supreme Court heard the case again in May 2012 and came again down in favor of Michael Somare. The deputy speaker accepted the Supreme court ruling, but declared the seat again immediately vacant on the ground that Somare had been absent for 90 days. He referred to the change in law that parliament had passed on 9 December just before the Supreme Court's decision. O'Neill was therefore again elected as Prime Minister.Nick Perkins, Judicial Independence around the world. Available at: https://constitution-unit.com/2012/06/08/judicial- independence-across-the-world-papua-new-guinea/ Posted on 8 June 2012 The Supreme Court ignored the change of law of 9 December 2011. It was also not valid on 12 December, as the Speaker of Parliament still had to certify the change of law. This brought to the fore the issue of constitutional law. The Constitution stresses separation of powers. According to those on the side of O'Neill, this implies that the Court cannot exercise executive decision making. The constitutional court can only judge on the constitutionality of a law or general measure. In this case, they were seen to encroach on the power of parliament. The legal battle was a conflict on the sovereignty of parliament.Peter Donigi, Constitutional Technicalities: Why is O‚ÄôNeill is PNG‚Äôs Prime Minister.

This was not in the first place a legal battle, but a political one. It was a struggle for political support. The O'Neill/Namah government obtained that support immediately in August 2011. The PM and cabinet were recognized by the Crown through the Governor-General, Michael Ogio. It also immediately gained international recognition, and the approval of Australia was especially vital.Gregory B. Poling: Constitutional crisis erupts in Papua New Guinea.

The judgment of the Supreme Court on 12 December 2011 was therefore a shock. Somare immediately announced a new cabinet and had his cabinet sworn in by the Governor General. Somare himself did in his opinion not need to be sworn in, as that had happened already when he became PM again in 2007. Parliament protested strongly against this. Ogio was suspended and the speaker of parliament, Jeffrey Nape, became acting Governor General. Nape then swore in O'Neill and his cabinet. Civil society organisations, especially churches, offered to mediate.Churches, civil societies seek a collaborative route out of PNG political impasse.

Somare did not come into parliament and was with his cabinet in an Ela Beach hotel. He had the support of about 20 MPs. Ogio was therefore supporting a government that did not have a majority on parliament and his position became thus untenable. He changed his mind and supported the O'Neill government.

For example, MPs stormed the house of the Governor- General when he supported Somare. It is thus not surprising that control over the police was one of the main issues during the stalemate. Somare immediately after the court case appointed Fred Yakasa as police commander. Yakasa controlled the armed response unit of the police. That unit had remained loyal to Somare and had prevented O'Neill from entering the Governor-General's office (government house). O'Neill relied on his own appointment: Thomas Kulunga. Yakasa turned to the courts and got a restraining order that he was not to be harassed. The threat of arrest was no longer there, but Kulunga disarmed Yakasa's unit a few days later.Rowan Callick, Judge to protect police chief after claims his actions \\"border on treason\\".

It was originally fought on grounds that were not germane to the issue of legitimacy of the O'Neill government. The National Executive Council has no power over the appointment of judges; that is a prerogative of the Legal and Judicial Services Commission. The NEC (Cabinet), however, has the power of appointment over the Chief Justice and it used these powers during the constitutional crisis. Chief Sir Salamo Injia was dismissed in early November on various grounds of personal misbehaviour. The main claim was stealing from the estate of a deceased judge entrusted to the courts. This was one month before the Supreme Court had to rule over the constitutionality of the O'Neill/Nama government.Bill Standish: Crises compounded; Papua New Guinea politics in November 2011 Available at: http://www.devpolicy.org/crises- compounded-papua-new-guinea-politics-in-november-2011-20111114/ Posted on: 14 November 2011 Accessed on 18 July 2018 The Supreme Court reacted with a charge of contempt of court for the attorney general Allan Marat and the deputy PM Belden Namah.

The court came down in the case against O'Neill with a three to two majority. The Governor General proceeded to recognise the Somare government while parliament continued to support O'Neill. The court decision was ignored by the O'Neill government and ultimately the Governor General also gave in. The government was not satisfied and pursued the conflict with the Supreme Court further. In February there was another attempt to suspend the Chief Justice on grounds of personal misbehaviour, and a panel of judges was mentioned to look at misconduct by Salomo Injia. This charge was stayed shortly thereafter by the National Court. Despite this, Salomo Injia was forcibly arrested on 6 March and charged. The National Court met on 13 March on the case and permanently stayed the charges, as these were flawed. Justice Logan: A year in the life of an Australian member of the PNG Judiciary.

Very soon after enacting the law two Supreme Court judges, Solomon Injia and Nicholas Kiriwom, were mentioned for disciplinary action to the Governor-General.

He was the leader of a fledgling Japanese community in Honokaa. Early years Goto was born in Kokufu-mura, Naka District, Kanagawa Prefecture. He was the eldest son of Izaemon Kobayakawa. He had three brothers and two sisters. After receiving an education, Goto worked as a city employee at the Port of Yokohama. It was there that he learned the English language. Career On February 8, 1885, he came to the Kingdom of Hawaii as a government contract laborer aboard the SS City of Tokio. He was part of the first shipload of Kanyaku Imin; 25 more shiploads arrived over the next decade. Goto was contracted to a  ª≈å ª≈çkala plantation that had been organized and managed by John Harris Soper prior to his 1884 appointment as marshal of the Hawaiian Kingdom. After working for three years in the sugarcane fields, Goto he opened a general merchandise store on the Big Island. Because of his English language fluency and his intolerance at seeing field workers being exploited, he often went to court in defense of the Japanese immigrant laborers. Unpopular with the plantation managers, Goto was caught and hanged by a group of six men: Joseph R. (JR) Mills, a local hotel and mercantile store owner; Walter Blabon a drayman; Thomas Steele a luna or overseer on Robert Overend's plantation; William Watson a drayman who worked for J. R. Mills; and John Richmond, Overend's stableman. The sixth accomplice was a Hawaiian man named Lala, who fled the scene before the hanging. The group ambushed Goto on his way from Overend's Plantation after he met with Japanese workers regarding conditions on Overend's Plantation, hog tied and he was hanged from a telephone pole in October 1889. After Deputy Sheriff Rufus Anderson Lyman informed Edward Griffin Hitchcock of Goto's murder in Honokaa, the suspects were caught. Charges were dropped against Lala and John Richmond for their cooperation with authorities, while the others were tried and found guilty of manslaughter: Mills and Steele in the 2nd degree, to serve 9 years, and Blabon and Watson in the 3rd degree to serve four years.Hawaii State Archives, First Circuit Court; Court Case #430: The Crown vs J.R. Mills Steele and Blabon escaped from prison to Australia and California respectively, Watson served out his time, and J. R. Mills was pardoned in 1894 after four years in prisonPacific Commercial Advertiser, July 5, 1895. c. 2, pg. 7 by the new government of Hawaii. Legacy The episode became the subject matter of a 2001 play, Another Heaven. At least two biographies about Goto have been written, Katsu Goto: the first immigrant from Japan (1988) by Fumiko Kaya, and Hamakua Hero: a true plantation story (2010) by P. Y. Iwasaki. In 2010, a memorial in celebration of the 125th anniversary of Goto's arrival to Hawaii was erected in Honokaa; the Memorial Service Committee was composed of several people, including a Hawaii State Senator, Hawaii State Representative, members of the University of Hawaii at Hilo campus, and the Hiroshima-Hawaii Sister State Committee. The Katsu Goto Memorial Committee from Honokaa Hongwanji Mission produced a film in cooperation with Nippon Golden Network called Bringing the Legacy of Katsu Goto to Life about Goto's life and the humanities aspect of his story.

Suzanne √âdouard Manet, Interior at Arcachon (Mme Manet and L√©on Leenhoff), 1871, Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts An excellent pianist, Leenhoff was initially hired in 1851 by Manet's father, Auguste, as a piano teacher for √âdouard and his brothers. Auguste was a domineering figure in √âdouard's life, insisting that his son study law and avoid the arts. In their early twenties, Suzanne and √âdouard developed a personal relationship and were romantically involved for some ten years. After √âdouard left his parents' home, he and Suzanne lived together, although they kept their relationship discreet and secret, especially from √âdouard's father. (Leenhoff may also have been Auguste's mistress.) Leenhoff gave birth out of wedlock to a son, L√©on-Edouard Ko√´lla, on 29 January 1852. The birth certificate gave Leenhoff as the mother but \\"Ko√´lla\\" as the father, an individual never identified and likely invented. L√©on was baptised in 1855, and became known as Suzanne's young brother. Suzanne and √âdouard were finally married in October 1863, a year after the death of √âdouard's father.Manet 1832-1883, Fran√ßoise Cachin, p286. √âdouard never publicly confirmed L√©on as his son. L√©on posed often for √âdouard Manet. Most famously, he is the subject of the Boy Carrying a Sword of 1861 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He also appears as the boy carrying a tray in the background of The Balcony.Mauner, G. L., & Loyrette, H. Manet: the still-life paintings. New York: H.N. Abrams in association with the American Federation of Arts, 2000. p. 66. . Portrait by Degas Edgar Degas, M. and Mme √âdouard Manet, 1868-1869, √âdouard Manet and Edgar Degas met by chance at the Louvre in 1862, and after an intense conversation and Manet's demonstration on the art of etching, they became lifelong friends. Sometime in 1868 Degas painted a portrait of Manet and his wife. Manet is reclining on a couch and Suzanne appears to be seated at a piano. The mystery that surrounds the portrait by Degas is the fact that the painting has been slashed from top to bottom and right through the likeness of Suzanne. The supposition is that Manet, for an unknown reason, cut the painting. Manet might have slashed the painting because he did not like the way Suzanne was painted, or because he was feuding at the time with Degas, or he might have been angry with his wife. When Degas saw what had been done to his painting he demanded its return, and he took it back. Degas intended to re-paint the likeness of Suzanne at the piano and he reiterated his intention to Ambroise Vollard in conversation with him around the turn of the century. Degas never got around to fixing the painting and it remains in its slashed state in the Kitakyushu Municipal Museum of Art in Japan.Manet 1832-1883, Paul-Andr√© Lemoisne, pp140-142.NY Times, March 1992, ART; Degas and Mrs. Manet Suzanne as a model File:√âdouard MANET - La Nymphe surprise - Google Art Project.jpg√âdouard Manet, The Startled Nymph, 1859-1861 File:Edouard Manet 005.jpg√âdouard Manet, The Reading, 1868 File:Edouard_Manet_Full-face_Portrait_of_Manets_Wife.jpg√âdouard Manet, Madame Manet, Norton Simon Museum, 1874-1876 File:Manet - Mme Manet im Gewaechshaus.JPG√âdouard Manet, Mme.

It can be used on several different dental materials that are curable by light. The light used falls under the visible blue light spectrum. This light is delivered over a range of wavelengths and varies for each type of device. There are four basic types of dental curing light sources: tungsten halogen, light-emitting diodes (LED), plasma arcs, and lasers. The two most common are halogen and LEDs.  History  In the early 1960s, the first light curing resin composites were developed. This led to the development of the first curing light, called Nuva Light, which was developed by Dentsply/Caulk in the 1970s. Nuva Light used ultraviolet light to cure resin composites. It was discontinued due to this requirement, as well as the fact that the shorter wavelengths of UV light did not penetrate deeply enough into the resin to adequately cure it. During the early 1980s, advances in the area of visible light curing took place, which ultimately led to the creation of a curing device that uses blue light. The next type of curing light developed was the quartz-halogen bulb; this device had longer wavelengths of the visible light spectrum and allowed for greater penetration of the curing light and light energy for resin composites. The halogen curing light replaced the UV curing light. The 1990s presented great improvements in light curing devices. As dental restorative materials advanced, so too did the technology used to cure these materials; the focus was to improve the intensity in order to be able to cure faster and deeper. In 1998 the plasma arc curing light was introduced. It uses a high intensity light source, a fluorescent bulb containing plasma, in order to cure the resin-based composite, and claimed to cure resin composite material within 3 seconds. In practice, however, while the plasma arc curing light proved to be popular, negative aspects (including, but not limited to, an expensive initial price, curing times longer than the claimed 3 seconds, and expensive maintenance) of these lights resulted in the development of other curing light technologies. The latest advancement in technology is the LED curing light. While LED curing lights have been available since the 1990s, they were not widely used until the frustrations presented through ownership of plasma arc lights became unbearable. While the LED curing light is a huge step forward from the initial curing light offerings, refinements and new technologies are continually being developed with the goal of quicker and more thorough curing of resin composites. Tungsten halogen curing lights Halogen lamp based curing light. In the halogen curing light the power supply feeds a cooling fan and a small halogen lamp attached to a reflector. The blue light is produced by a dichroic filter and directed by a waveguide. The light is temporarily switched on by pressing the trigger. The tungsten halogen curing light, also known as simply \\"halogen curing light\\" is the most frequent polymerization source used in dental offices. In order for the light to be produced, an electric current flows through a thin tungsten filament, which functions as a resistor. This resistor is then ‚Äúheated to temperatures of about 3,000 Kelvin, it becomes incandescent and emits infrared and electromagnetic radiation in the form of visible light‚Äù. It provides a blue light between 400 and 500 nm, with an intensity of 400‚Äì600 mW cm‚àí2. This type of curing light however has certain drawbacks, the first of which is the large amounts of heat that the filament generates. This requires that the curing light have a ventilating fan installed which results in a larger curing light. The fan generates a sound that may disturb some patients, and the wattage of the bulb is such (e.g. 80 W) these curing lights must be plugged into a power source; that is, they are not cordless. Furthermore, this light requires frequent monitoring and replacement of the actual curing light bulb because of the high temperatures that are reached. (For example, one model uses a bulb with an estimated life of 50 hours which would require annual replacement, assuming 12 minutes' use per day, 250 days per year.) Also, the time needed to fully cure the material is much more than the LED curing light. Light emitting diode curing lights LED curing light. These curing lights use one or more light-emitting diodes [LEDs] and produce blue light that cures the dental material. LEDs as light-curing sources were first suggested in the literature in 1995. A short history of LED curing in dentistry was published in 2013. This light uses a gallium nitride-based semiconductor for blue light emission. A 2004 article in the American Dental Association's journal explained, \\"In LED‚Äôs, a voltage is applied across the junctions of two doped semi- conductors (n-doped and p-doped), resulting in the generation and emission of light in a specific wavelength range. By controlling the chemical composition of the semiconductor combination, one can control the wavelength range. The dental LED curing lights use LED‚Äôs that produce a narrow spectrum of blue light in the 400‚Äì500 nm range (with a peak wavelength of about 460 nm), which is the useful energy range for activating the CPQ molecule most commonly used to initiate the photo-polymerization of dental monomers.\\" These curing lights are very different from halogen curing lights. They are more lightweight, portable and effective. The heat generated from LED curing lights is much less which means it does not require a fan to cool it. Since the fan was no longer needed, a more lightweight and smaller light could be designed. The portability of it comes from the low consumption of power. The LED can now use rechargeable batteries, making it much more comfortable and easier to use. The newest LED curing light cures material much faster than halogen lamps and previous LED curing lights. It uses a single high-intensity blue LED with a larger semiconductor crystal. Light intensity and the illumination area has been increased with an output of 1,000 mW/cm2. In order to emit such a high intensity light, it uses a highly reflective mirror film consisting of \\"multilayer polymer film technology\\". Operation The halogen and LED curing light are operated similarly. In order to turn on the blue light, both of these lights require the operator to press a button or a trigger. For the halogen curing lights, there is a trigger that is pressed. The older models require the operator to hold down the trigger for the light to emit unlike newer models that only require that the trigger be pressed once. For the LED lights, a button is placed on the device. For both the newer models of the halogen lights and the LED lights, after the trigger or button is pressed, the light will remain on until the timer expires. After the light is on, it is placed directly over the tooth that has the material in it until it is cured. Significance to dental treatment The development of the curing light greatly changed dentistry. Prior to the development of the dental curing light, different materials had to be used in order to have a resin based composite material placed in a tooth. The material used prior to this development was a self-curing resin material. These materials, an A material and a B material, were mixed separately before application. The A material was the base and the B material was the catalyst. This resin material was mixed first and then placed in the tooth. It is then self-cured/hardened fully after 30‚Äì60 seconds. This presented several issues to the dentist. One issue was that the dentist did not have control over how quickly the material cured‚Äîonce mixed the curing process started. This resulted in the dentist having to quickly and properly place the material in the tooth. If the material was not properly placed, then the material had to be excavated and the process started over again. The development of this new technology gave way to new light activated resin materials. These new materials are very different from the previous ones. These materials do not need to be mixed and can be dispensed directly into the site. This new malleable resin material can only be fully cured/hardened with a dental curing light. This presents new advantages for dentists: the time constraint is now lifted and the dentist can now assure that the material is properly placed.

But the story takes a cruel twist as the villains strike at the heart of the family by using Bobby (Nandamuri Balakrishna). When Bobby was a small Kid the villains kidnap him and threaten Ramakrishna to leave his father and save Bobby. Although Harischandra Prasad has no love on Ramakrishna, he loved his father and for fulfilling his father's wishes he stands to protect and Bobby is said to be escaped from the house. But Ramappa and his followers make Bobby a professional killer at the age of 12 by another killer (Charanraj) and use him to kill Harischandra Prasad. The whole family except Ramakrishna and his step- brother (Rahman) is unaware that Bobby killed Harischandra Prasad. Now Bobby is an adult and is a high-profile professional killer and returns to his land with the help of his newly found friend Deepu (Lakshmi Rai) who share mutual love interest. His mission, in short, is to protect his father from Ramappa. In this process it is revealed to the family members of Harischandra Prasad and the people that Bobby killed Harischandra Prasad and Moreover, the antagonists frame Ramakrishna as the man behind the Death of Harischandra. Frustrated and deeply hurt by this, Ramakrishna's Step Mother (Jayasudha) and wife (Sukanya) and the people expel the both and police arrest them and take them away for a secret encounter by Ramappa. Seeing this all, Ramakrishna's stepbrother, who was paralyzed earlier in attempt to catch Bobby during the murder of Harischandra, springs back to life and reveals the whole truth to his family and the people. Meanwhile, Ramkrishna and Bobby team up and kill all the enemies together. Later Ramakrishna's stepmother apologizes for the ill-treatment by her and orders him to fulfill his dead father's wishes.

This, the largest Protestant church in former Yugoslavia, has around 40,000 members. They are organized in 27 communities and are led by 20 pastors. Most members live in Vojvodina, an autonomous province in the Republic of Serbia north of the Sava and Danube; its headquarters are accordingly in Novi Sad. Until the founding of Yugoslavia, the communities belonged to the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary. The pastors are trained together with the pastors of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia, in Bratislava. In parish life, the Slovak language is the most widely used. The SEAVC is a member of the Lutheran World Federation and of the World Council of Churches.  History  Slovak Evangelical Church in Stara Pazova The history of Protestantism in this region begins in the first half of the 18th century, when evangelical Slovaks from the area around the Tatra Mountains in the former Upper Hungary left their homeland and settled on the southern border of the Habsburg Empire, in hope of being less exposed to the pressure of the Counter-Reformation there. Their first arrival was, according to some sources, in 1720 and according to the other in 1745. Additional migrations were during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Immediately after their arrival, they also organized themselves ecclesiastically, especially after the adoption of the Patent of Toleration in 1781. In the 18th century, Hungarian and German Lutherans also began to settle in the fertile areas of the Danube River. All of them, together with the Slovak Lutherans, were under the jurisdiction of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary until the break up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy at the end of World War I. The SEAVC was founded in 1921 as a church of Slovak Christians who previously belonged to the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hungary and whose settlement area had been separated from the land of their ancestors after the First World War and awarded to the newly established Yugoslavia. The founding synod was in Stara Pazova. The first Bishop was Adam Vere≈°, who was elected and installed in 1929 in Stara Pazova. In 2007 the German Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Serbia was re- established with the municipality in Zemun, Belgrade. In 2009 it was registered as part of the SEAVC under the name \\"German Seniorate of the Slovak Evangelical Church A.C. in Serbia ‚Äì German Evangelical Church Belgrade\\".  Organization  Slovak Evangelical Church in Baƒçki Petrovac. Slovak Evangelical Church in Jano≈°ik. The church is grouped into four dioceses (deaneries): B√°ƒçsky (Baƒçka), Ban√°tsky (Banat), Sriemsky (Syrmia), and German Seniorate, each headed and administered by a Senior Dean. The church counts in its geographically relatively widespread diocese 27 congregations and 14 branches (daughter communities). Currently there are 20 pastors, among them four women, as well as four Senior Deans, all headed and administered by the Bishop (Jaroslav Javorn√≠k, PhD., elected in 2020). The highest administrative and legislative authority is the Synod, which meets annually. Theological education of pastors is provided at the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia, which also trains seminary students of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia.  Relationships with other churches and organizations  The SEAVC maintains partnerships with the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession. in Slovakia, the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia, the Evangelical Church in Germany, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The SEAVC is a member of the World Council of Churches (since 1963), the Conference of European Churches, the Lutheran World Federation (since 1952), and the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. It is also a partner church of the Gustav-Adolf-Werk.

History During British rule, all links from the northern part of Bengal and Assam to the rest of India were through the eastern part of Bengal. The most important connection was the Calcutta‚ÄìParbatipur‚ÄìHaldibari‚ÄìSiliguri link first established in 1878 and then developed in stages (for details see Howrah-New Jalpaiguri Line). During the nineteenth century, Lalmonirhat was linked to the Dooars. In pre-independence days, a metre gauge line running via Radhikapur, Biral, Parbatipur, Tista, Gitaldaha and Golokganj connected Fakiragram in Assam with Katihar in Bihar. With the partition of India in 1947, all these links were lost. Indian Railways took up the Assam Link Project in 1948 to build a rail link between Fakiragram and Kishanganj. Fakiragram was connected to the Indian railway system in 1950 through the Indian portion of North Bengal with a metre gauge track. The New Jalpaiguri‚ÄìNew Bongaigaon section was partly new construction, partly old line converted to broad gauge in 1966. The long wide broad gauge Siliguri-Jogihopa line was constructed between 1963 and 1965. Branch lines The Haldibari‚ÄìNew Jalpaiguri line has gone through two successive gauge changes. As most other railway tracks in the area were metre gauge, the line was converted from broad gauge to metre gauge in 1949. Then in 1960s when broad gauge was introduced in the area, the line was converted back to broad gauge and connected to the new station at New Jalpaiguri. The metre gauge branch line from Malbazar in Jalpaiguri district to Changrabandha in Cooch Behar district is now an isolated section, with no service, as per the railway time table. In pre- independence days, the line was up to Mogalhat, now in Bangladesh. The present metre gauge line on the Bangladesh side from Burimari to Lalmonirhat is still functional. The Alipuduar‚ÄìBamanhat branch line ends near the India-Bangladesh border across the Dharla River. In pre-independence days, it used to connect to Mogalhat, now in Bangladesh, across the Dharla. The bridge is broken. The line from Golokganj meets the branch line. The New Cooch Behar‚ÄìGolokganj section is nearing conversion to broad gauge. The line passed through Gitaldaha at some point of time. The 66 km Fakiragram-Dhubri branch line was inaugurated after gauge conversion in September 2010.

As she refuses to talk on the phone, he wants a friend to go with him while he explains to her that he has a wife and two children. The pair drive through the night, drinking beer and talking crudely about women. At a stop, when an older woman challenges Billy to have sex with her, his machismo is revealed as immature bluster. Arriving at Patti's apartment after midnight, she tells them she will have the baby and wants nothing from Billy. Then she shuts herself in her bedroom. Billy begs Eddie to speak to her and she lets him in. After talking about each other's lonely lives, he divorced and she preferring freedom, tenderly they make love. Billy looks in and sees he is no longer wanted. As he prepares to drive Eddie home, Patti takes a photograph of him to give to the child one day. When Eddie asks, Patti says he can call again.

Lake Borobudur is an ancient lake that has been suggested once existed surrounding Borobudur Buddhist monument in Kedu Plain, Central Java, Indonesia. Unlike other temples, which were built on a flat surface, Borobudur was built on a bedrock hill, above sea level and above the floor of the dried-out paleolake. The lake's existence had been the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century; Borobudur was thought to have been built on a lake shore or even surrounded by a lake. Nieuwenkamp's proposition In 1931, a Dutch artist and scholar of Hindu and Buddhist architecture, W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp, developed a theory that Kedu Plain was once a lake and Borobudur initially represented a lotus flower floating on the lake.J.G. de Casparis, \\"The Dual Nature of Barabudur\\", in G√≥mez and Woodward (1981), page 70 and 83. Lotus flowers are found in almost every Buddhist work of art, often serving as a throne for buddhas and base for stupas. The architecture of Borobudur itself suggests a lotus depiction, in which Buddha postures in Borobudur symbolize the Lotus Sutra, mostly found in many Mahayana Buddhism (a school of Buddhism widely spread in the east Asia region) texts. Three circular platforms on the top are also thought to represent a lotus petals. Nieuwenkamp has suggested that the landscape near Borobudur included lakes, and that the temples were arranged around these lakes in form of flowers and mathematical patterns considered to be auspicious, and that the temples were connected by paved brick roads lined by walls. These lakes and roads were later filled with metres of volcanic ash from the multiple eruptions of Mount Merapi, which lies very closely to the east of the area. Nieuwenkamp's theory, however, was contested by many archaeologists, such as Dumar√ßay and Soekmono, arguing the natural environment surrounding the monument was dry land. This theory is controversial, but recent geological evidence supports Nieuwenkamp proposal.Murwanto, H.; Gunnell, Y; Suharsono, S.; Sutikno, S. and Lavigne, F (2004). ‚ÄúBorobudur monument (Java, Indonesia) stood by a natural lake: chronostratigraphic evidence and historical implications‚Äù. The Holocene 14 (3): 459‚Äì463Newhall C.G., Bronto S., Alloway B., Banks N.G., Bahar I., del Marmol M.A., Hadisantono R.D., Holcomb R.T., McGeehin J., Miksic J.N., Rubin M., Sayudi S.D., Sukhyar R., Andreastuti S., Tilling R.I., Torley R., Trimble D., and Wirakusumah A.D. (2000). ‚Äú10,000 Years of explosive eruptions of Merapi Volcano, Central Java: archaeological and modern implications‚Äù. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 100 (1): 9‚Äì50  Palynological investigation and geomorphology analysis Dumar√ßay together with Professor Thanikaimoni had taken soil samples in 1974 and again in 1977 from trial trenches that had been dug into the hill, as well as from the plain immediately to the south. These samples were later analysed by Professor Thanikaimoni, who examined their pollen and spore content in order to identify the type of vegetation that had grown in the area around the time of Borobudur‚Äôs construction. They were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment. The area surrounding Borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at the time of the monument‚Äôs construction, as is still the case today. Caesar Vo√ªte and the geomorphologist Dr J.J. Nossin in 1985‚Äì86 field studies re-examined the Borobudur lake hypothesis and concluded the absence of a lake around Borobudur at the time of its construction and active use as a sanctuary. These findings were endorsed by UNESCO in A New Perspective on Some Old Questions Pertaining to Borobudur compiled within the 2005 UNESCO publication titled \\"The Restoration of Borobudur\\". Geological findings In 2000s, geologists, on the other hand, support Nieuwenkamp's view, pointing out clay sediments found near the site.R.W. van Bemmelen (1949). The geology of Indonesia, general geology of Indonesia and adjacent archipelago, vol 1A, The Hague, Government Printing Office, Martinus Nijhoff. cited in Murwanto (2004). A study of stratigraphy, sediment and pollen samples conducted in 2000 supports the existence of a paleolake environment near Borobudur, which tends to confirm Nieuwenkamp's theory. The lake area fluctuated with time and the study also proves that Borobudur was near the lake shore c. 13th and 14th centuries. River flows and volcanic activities shape the surrounding landscape, including the lake. One of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, Mount Merapi's has been very active since the Pleistocene. Conclusion The location Borobudur surroundings, the ancient lake as suggested once located in south-southeast from Borobudur, and probably south from Mendut temple on Progo and Elo rivers confluence. To reconcile among these findings, it seems that there was once a lake near Borobudur during its construction and at the time of its initial active use in the 9th century. However contrary to Nieuwenkamp's theory ‚Äî of Borobudur as a blossoming lotus in the center of the pond ‚Äî the lake was not surrounding the whole Borobudur of the bedrock hill completely, but just some small sections of it . It might be possible that the lower parts of the Kedu plains surrounding Borobudur near the river, was once naturally flooded and created a small shallow lake for at least until 13th to 14th century. The nearest portion of this elongated lake was estimated to be located around 500 metres south from Borobudur along the small river that drained to the southeast where it joins the Progo river. The lake just flooded the lower portion of the valley located in south and southeast from the temple, while the east, west and northern sides are dry lands probably cultivated as rice paddies, orchards and palm trees just like today. There were probably other lakes located several hundred metres south from Mendut temple on Progo and Elo rivers confluence, and north from Pawon temple along Progo river. These lakes existed until the 13th to 14th centuries, when Merapi's volcanic activity, collapsed the natural dam barrier and finally drained the lake.

The symphony is scored for two oboes, two horns and strings. In contemporary orchestras, it was also usual to include bassoons and harpsichord if they were available in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line and act as the continuo. The horns are silent for the second movement.

No autographs exist for Mozart's four D major symphonies written during his first trip to Italy (K. 81, K. 84, K. 95 and K. 97), and as such their authenticity is doubtful. A copy of K. 81, dated 25 April 1770, attributes the symphony to Wolfgang.Neal Zaslaw: Symphony in D major, K. 73l/81. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Earliest Symphonies. Recording of the Academy of Ancient Music. Concertmaster: Jaap Schr√∂der, Continuo: Christopher Hogwood. Decca Record, London 1986. A letter from 25 April 1770 from Mozart to his sister states that Leopold had copied one of his (Mozart's) symphonies so that the autograph could remain in the house.Volker Scherliess: Die Sinfonien. In: Silke Leopold (editor): Mozart-Handbuch. B√§renreiter-Verlag, Kassel 2005, , . A catalogue of Breitkopf & H√§rtel lists Leopold as the composer, but the reason for this could be that Leopold, and not Wolfgang, presented the work to them. In his edition of the K√∂chel catalogue, Alfred Einstein rejects the authorship of Leopold, stating that it would be strange if Leopold composed one of the most \\"charming and intelligent\\" of the Italian symphonies of 1770. However, in the similar case of the \\"Lambach\\" symphonies, the \\"more modern\\" \\"New Lambach\\" symphony turned out to be Leopold's work. Also, Neal Zaslaw disagrees with this viewpoint (\\"charming and intelligent\\") of K. 81, instead calling it \\"bright, superficial and conventional\\". Bernhard Paumgartner assigned the symphony to Wolfgang, and stated (similarly to Wolfgang Gersthofer) that these four Italian symphonies are similar to each other, making it likely that they are all the work of the same composer, and that they are characteristic of Mozart's symphonies composed in Italy. Thus, they consider it very likely that Mozart was the author of all four symphonies.Bernhard Paumgartner: Mozart.

The unnumbered symphonies (some, including K. 81, published in supplements to the Alte-Mozart Ausgabe until 1910) are sometimes given numbers in the range 42 to 56, even though they were written earlier than Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (written in 1788).

In the northwest and north the region is bordered by the River Sude (from Kuhstorf to L√ºbtheen), the stream of the Strohkirchener Bach and its continuation as the New Canal (this valley is used by the Hagenow to Ludwigslust railway). The region's southeastern border runs roughly from the town of Ludwigslust to D√∂mitz (following the Elde Canal), in the southwest the River R√∂gnitz forms the boundary of the Griese Gegend from Woosmer (today a village in the municipality of Vielank) to L√ºbtheen. The region forms a large triangle. The origin of the name is not entirely clear; on the one hand the soil ‚Äì which is mainly sandy ‚Äì has a grey colour (= griese). In former times aeolian sand (Flugsand) even entered villages that then had to be abandoned. On the other hand the day labourers here wore undyed, grey linen clothes. The soil is poorly suited for arable farming and hardly any noble estate owners established themselves here. As a result there were a lot of state-owned estates in the Griese Gegend that were subordinated directly to Mecklenburg's ruling house. The notorious practice of peasant clearance in order to appropriate land for noble estates (Bauernlegen) was very rare in this area and, as a result, the original farm holdings can still be seen in many villages today. The Wendish population was able to remain in the Griese Gegend longer than in the rest of Mecklenburg. The once vast heath (Heide) in the area is recalled today in several place names (Heidhof, Pichersche Heide), these areas have largely given way to forests and farmers' fields. The formation of the sandur region is due to the retreat of the glacier in the last ice age. All its rivers and streams flow southwest, towards the Lower Elbe. In the south of the region, around the parish of Malli√ü, brown coal was mined in open-cast pits from 1817 to 1960, with interruptions.

The concept was first introduced as such by Ham, Lee, and Saul in 2003, adding a manifold constraint to the general problem of correlating sets of high-dimensional vectors. Overview Manifold alignment assumes that disparate data sets produced by similar generating processes will share a similar underlying manifold representation. By learning projections from each original space to the shared manifold, correspondences are recovered and knowledge from one domain can be transferred to another. Most manifold alignment techniques consider only two data sets, but the concept extends to arbitrarily many initial data sets. Consider the case of aligning two data sets, X and Y, with X_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m and Y_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Manifold alignment algorithms attempt to project both X and Y into a new d-dimensional space such that the projections both minimize distance between corresponding points and preserve the local manifold structure of the original data. The projection functions are denoted: \\\\phi_{X}:\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\\\phi_{Y}:\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} Let W represent the binary correspondence matrix between points in X and Y: W_{i,j}=\\\\begin{cases} 1 & if\\\\, X_{i}\\\\leftrightarrow Y_{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & otherwise \\\\end{cases} Let S_X and S_Y represent pointwise similarities within data sets. This is usually encoded as the heat kernel of the adjacency matrix of a k-nearest neighbor graph. Finally, introduce a coefficient 0 \\\\le \\\\mu \\\\le 1, which can be tuned to adjust the weight of the 'preserve manifold structure' goal, versus the 'minimize corresponding point distances' goal. With these definitions in place, the loss function for manifold alignment can be written: \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\phi_{X},\\\\phi_{Y}}\\\\mu\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\left\\\\Vert \\\\phi_{X}\\\\left(X_{i}\\\\right)-\\\\phi_{X}\\\\left(X_{j}\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\Vert ^{2}S_{X,i,j}+\\\\mu\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\left\\\\Vert \\\\phi_{Y}\\\\left(Y_{i}\\\\right)-\\\\phi_{Y}\\\\left(Y_{j}\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\Vert ^{2}S_{Y,i,j}+\\\\left(1-\\\\mu\\\\right)\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\Vert\\\\phi_{X}\\\\left(X_{i}\\\\right)-\\\\phi_{Y}\\\\left(Y_{j}\\\\right)\\\\Vert^{2}W_{i,j} Solving this optimization problem is equivalent to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem using the graph laplacian of the joint matrix, G: G=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mu S_X & \\\\left(1-\\\\mu\\\\right)W\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(1-\\\\mu\\\\right)W^T & \\\\mu S_Y \\\\end{array}\\\\right] Inter-data correspondences The algorithm described above requires full pairwise correspondence information between input data sets; a supervised learning paradigm. However, this information is usually difficult or impossible to obtain in real world applications. Recent work has extended the core manifold alignment algorithm to semi-supervised , unsupervised , and multiple- instance settings. One-step vs. two-step alignment The algorithm described above performs a \\"one-step\\" alignment, finding embeddings for both data sets at the same time. A similar effect can also be achieved with \\"two- step\\" alignments , following a slightly modified procedure: # Project each input data set to a lower-dimensional space independently, using any of a variety of dimension reduction algorithms. # Perform linear manifold alignment on the embedded data, holding the first data set fixed, mapping each additional data set onto the first's manifold. This approach has the benefit of decomposing the required computation, which lowers memory overhead and allows parallel implementations. Instance-level vs. feature-level projections Manifold alignment can be used to find linear (feature-level) projections, or nonlinear (instance-level) embeddings. While the instance- level version generally produces more accurate alignments, it sacrifices a great degree of flexibility as the learned embedding is often difficult to parameterize. Feature-level projections allow any new instances to be easily embedded in the manifold space, and projections may be combined to form direct mappings between the original data representations. These properties are especially important for knowledge-transfer applications. Applications Manifold alignment is suited to problems with several corpora that lie on a shared manifold, even when each corpus is of a different dimensionality. Many real-world problems fit this description, but traditional techniques are not able to take advantage of all corpora at the same time. Manifold alignment also facilitates transfer learning, in which knowledge of one domain is used to jump-start learning in correlated domains. Applications of manifold alignment include: * Cross-language information retrieval / automatic translation ** By representing documents as vector of word counts, manifold alignment can recover the mapping between documents of different languages. ** Cross-language document correspondence is relatively easy to obtain, especially from multi-lingual organizations like the European Union. * Transfer learning of policy and state representations for reinforcement learning * Alignment of protein NMR structures * Accelerating model learning in robotics by sharing data generated by other robots  References  Further reading Chang Wang's Manifold alignment overview Category:Artificial intelligence Category:Machine learning algorithms ","title":"Manifold alignment"},{"id":"34053964","text":"Michael Shaw or Mike Shaw may refer to: * Michael Shaw, Baron Shaw of Northstead (born 1920), British politician * Michael Shaw (American football) (born 1989), American football player * Michael Shaw (Maine politician), American politician from Maine * Mike Shaw (1957‚Äì2010), professional wrestler * Mike Shaw (Family Affairs), fictional character * Mike Shaw (heart operation patient), early open-heart surgery patient of C.

Radiomultikulti was a radiostation, which was destinated to all communities, expatriates and foreigners who lived in Berlin. Multicult.fm wants to keep this orientation. The first show was broadcast on 31 December 22h05, simultaneously when radiomultikulti was shut down. Since 24 March, multicult.fm broadcasts from its own studio, located in a market house in Berlin-Kreuzberg  The station  Since January 2009, the station broadcasts 24/7 on the Internet. 34 shows are produced by several journalists (December 2011), music content is mainly based on worldmusic. Multicult.fm cooperates with other local radiostations from Berlin on the 88.4 MHz FM frequency , which can also be listened in Potsdam on the 90.7 MHz. Following hours are allowed to multicult.fm for this frequency: Mondays to Fridays from 6am to 10am and from 6pm to 7pm. Weekends from 6am to 12pm and exceptional live shows from 12pm to 4pm. Das Morgen:Magazin (morning show) is a show which relates on current political and cultural subjects, with guest interviews. Since December 2011, 10 new shows are added to the programm, among them ≈ûimdi, a German-Turkish show about what happens politically, culturally and musically in Turkey, and relations between German and Turkish people, espacially in Berlin. Then Bogheboxi, another bilingual show in Italian and German about Sardinia.  Worldmusics  Its musical playlists are mostly based on world music, in its large definition, every style we can find around the world, from Tango to Salsa, from Cajun to Balkan music, with also not avoiding local bands from Berlin or Germany. Examples of shows: * Africa Calling presented by Wolfgang K√∂nig, about African musics * Caf√© Ol√© presented by Wolfgang K√∂nig, about fusion styles. * Panamericana presented by Katrin Wilke, about Latin American musics  Multiculturalism and multilingualism  4th logo version 3rd logo version multicult.fm produces several shows in foreign languages, sometimes bilingual for example: * Chinese : Rocking Pagoda with Djane Lan * Chinese/German : Luftbr√ºcke with Lea Zhou * Turkish/German : ≈ûimdi with Nora ≈ûevbihiv Sinemillioƒülu and Seda Niƒübolu * Spanish/German : La Reglaf√≥nica with Maria Mandarina and Bongo * Italian/German : Bogheboxi with Maurizio Rocca and Pitzente Bianco * Serbo-croatian : BalkanCult with Jasmina Njaradi Furthermore, some shows are originally produced by other radiostations around the world, which used to work with former radiomultikulti and are still integrated in multicult.fm's programm, for example: * English : Tangents avec Dore Stein, from San Francisco * English : Radio Goethe avec Arndt Peltner, from San Francisco * Catalan : Catalan!Music, from Barcelona * Polish : Strange way of traveling with Vojciech Ossowski, from Warsaw * Romanian : Muzica Americii Latine, from Bucharest * Spanish : Los Sonidos del Planeta Arul with Paco Valiente, from Valencia * Turkish : Dunyayi Dinliyorum with Zekria from A√ßƒ±k Radyo, Istanbul  Promiscuity and globality  Thanks to its location in the house market of Marheineke in Berlin-Kreuzberg, it offers the possibility for every people to observe real speakers, technicians and journalists, whom you also can directly talk to. Main themes are about multiculturality, immigration, and some journalists, speakers have migration backgrounds. On 25 November was open the MulticulTea Bubble Bar.

Together they explore the world of mathematics by helping each other solve problems spanning a wide range of difficulty, from extensions of high school mathematics to extremely difficult problems previously addressed by famous mathematicians. While the book is presented as a novel, the bulk of its content is related to finding the solution to complex math problems, so could also be considered a form of textbook.  Synopsis  At the start of his first year of high school, the narrator meets a new classmate, a girl named Miruka. Without introducing herself, she gives him the beginning to number sequences, to which he answers with their continuation. One year later, the narrator is handed a letter by another girl, a new student named Tetra. The letter she wrote is a request for the narrator to tutor her in math. He begins teaching her, making Miruka jealous. The narrator balances his friendship with Tetra and his romantic interest in Miruka until Miruka and Tetra become friends after Tetra demonstrates her dedication to learning mathematics.  Characters   Main characters  The narrator :The protagonist of the books. The story in each book is told from his perspective. He is a second year student in a Japanese high school (equivalent to 11th grade in the US school system). His name is not given throughout the series. During middle school, he spent his time after school working on mathematics in the library. He begins to repeat this pattern in high school, but as his friendship with Miruka and Tetra develop he spends most of his time working on math problems with them. :Other than the fact that he wears glasses, his physical characteristics are not described. He has a quiet personality, but is somewhat self-conscious of his mathematical ability as compared to Miruka and Tetra, and when he has difficulty solving a math problem he tends to become depressed. He is very conscious of Miruka and Tetra as potential love interests, but is too shy to initiate a relationship with either one. :He acts as both a teacher and a student, at times working on problems given to him by Miruka or Mr. Muraki, at other times teaching Tetra. He does not like to speak before large groups of people, but he is not hesitant to speak up when teaching Tetra and Miruka. Miruka :Miruka is a second year high school student, in the same homeroom as the narrator. She studies mathematics with him following their first encounter under a cherry tree on the day of their entrance ceremony to high school. :She is a tall, beautiful girl with long black hair and a dignified demeanor. She wears metal-frame glasses. She has the top grades for math in her class. She tends to act without consideration of others. The narrator interprets her habit of helping herself to his notebook and starting conversations with others at inopportune times as signs of her lack of inhibitions. At one point she is depicted as lecturing about math to another student who had no particular interest because the narrator was not there to listen to her. She tends to sulk when she feels that she is being ignored. This is shown in scenes where the narrator ignores what she is saying, or when he finds himself daydreaming. :Her actions become even more extreme when those she considers an \\"outsider\\" try to insinuate themselves into her social sphere. In one scene she finds the narrator teaching math to Tetra (who she has never met) in the library, and responds by kicking her chair out from under her. She also stomps on the narrator's foot and walks off alone when she goes to meet him, but finds him talking to Tetra. She stops such behavior after becoming friends with Tetra. There are scenes in the book that indicate that she thinks of the narrator as more than just a friend, but she rarely reveals her emotions, so it is difficult to read her true intent towards him. :She thinks of Tetra as being \\"cute\\". At one point, she mentions to the narrator that she could never be as cute as Tetra. :She has a great love for mathematics. She is normally quiet and subdued, but immediately becomes loquacious when she starts to talk about math. She rarely talks about anything else, for example starting her first conversation with the narrator when they meet with a series of math problems. :She tends to like anyone who shows an interest in math. She is at first ambivalent, even antagonistic towards Tetra. She later warms up to Tetra, though, when she sees that she is earnestly pursuing mathematical studies with the narrator, and after she hears that Tetra has independently come up with an idea that leads to an elegant solution to the Basel problem, they become close friends. :She has a deep knowledge of mathematics, and in most cases is seen leading the narrator and Tetra through discussions. :She can play the piano, and sometimes plays arrangements for four hands with Ay-Ay during lunch. Tetra :Tetra graduated from the same middle school as the narrator, and is a first year high school student, one year behind the narrator and Miruka. She suffers from mathematical anxiety, and after entering high school approaches the narrator to ask him to tutor her in math. :She is petite with short hair and large eyes, and is a sweet and energetic girl. The narrator comments that she reminds him of a squirrel eating a nut. :Tetra's expression clearly shows what she is thinking, which the narrator appreciates because it lets him know if she is following his explanations. She uses exaggerated gestures, frequently making the narrator wish that she would calm down. :She is romantically attracted to the narrator, who she also greatly respects because he takes the time to listen to what she has to say. She also thinks very highly of Miruka, and is also romantically attracted to her, what with her being bisexual :She first begins studying mathematics seriously because she thinks that she would like to go on to some kind of computer-related work, or some other career that might involve math. She is somewhat careless, though, which frequently leads to her forgetting to take mathematical conditions into consideration when trying to solve math problems. She occasionally shows flashes of deep mathematical insight that surprise even Miruka, however.  Other characters  Ay-Ay :Ay-Ay is a friend of Miruka's. She is in the same grade as the narrator and Miruka, but in a different class. She is the leader of the piano club \\"Fortissimo\\", and is equally attractive with Miruka. When not in class, she spends most of her time in front of a piano. Mr. Muraki :Mr. Muraki is a math teacher at the narrator's high school. The narrator refers to him as being \\"strange\\", but knows that Mr. Muraki likes him and the others. :He gives the narrator and Miruka math problems. The problems are always written on index cards, and many are just equations with no explanation. His reason for doing so is apparently because he wants the students to think about every step of the problem, including its creation. In fact, when he once gives Miruka a problem for which she already knows the answer, he tells her that it is not necessarily the answer that he's after. He tells her that if she already knows the answer, to use the problem to find something interesting. He shows a strong interest in his students, for example by giving them problems tailored to their abilities. He eventually begins giving Tetra cards, as well. Tsunomiya :Tsunomiya is a classmate of the narrator's. According to the narrator, he has the best grades in his grade, and is also good at sports. At one point Miruka corners him and gives him a lecture on mathematics, but he moves away from her at the first opportunity. Ms. Mizutani :Ms. Mizutani is the school librarian. When it becomes time for school to close, she moves quietly to the middle of the library and announces that everyone must leave. She wears dark glasses that obscure any expression.

The chapters were subsequently published in two tank≈çbon volumes. This was followed by subsequent manga and tank≈çbon versions of Math Girls 2: Fermat's Last Theorem (illustrated by Kasuga Shun) and Math Girls 3: G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorems (illustrated by Matsuzaki Miyuki). Math Girls Manga appeared in English translation from Bento Books in 2013 (), followed by Math Girls Manga 2 in 2016 ().  Math primers  Hiroshi Yuki also authors the series of mathematics primers. These books take the form of characters from the Math Girls series discussing various topics from mathematics, but can be considered nonfiction in that they are intended to be strictly instructional, and do not advance the storyline of the Math Girls series. The following titles from this series are available in English translation from Bento Books: * Math Girls Talk About... Equations and Graphs () * Math Girls Talk About... Integers () * Math Girls Talk About... Trigonometry () Other books in this series currently available only in Japanese cover sequences and series, calculus, vectors, probability, and statistics.

She supervised the construction of the Haus der Kunst, the remodeling of the K√∂nigsplatz, and the construction of the Ehrentempels. She remained an architectural and design adviser to Hitler's circle up to the end of the war. In 1943, she received from Hitler an endowment of 100,000 Reichsmarks.Gerd R.

Troost was one of few people who actively disagreed with Hitler without fear of being fired or arrested. Hitler listened to Troost about art and architecture. During denazification she was classified as \\"less responsible\\" (Minderbelastete) by the Hauptspruchkammer and sentenced to a fine of 500 DM and a 10-year Berufsverbot. At the end of the period, Troost resumed work and resided in Sch√ºtzing, a town on the Chiemsee in Upper Bavaria.

It maintained active naval flight operations during the period 1941-1945. History The federal government purchased 142 acres of farmland in 1941 to build an outlying airfield supporting operations at Naval Air Station Alameda. A 4,000-foot asphalt-paved runway was oriented 070-250 and crossed at its midpoint by a second 3,800-foot asphalt runway oriented 130-310. Each runway had a parallel taxiway, and a third taxiway connected the easterly ends of the two runways to an intermediate concrete apron. An additional 75 acres acquired in June, 1943, allowed construction of an operations building with a two-story control tower, a fire and crash truck garage, two gasoline storage tanks, an oil storage building, a small arms ammunition magazine, a well for the airfield water supply, and a backstop used for small arms practice and aircraft machinegun collimation.McNaughton, Marie Thomas \\"Town's Aviation History\\" in This Week Sonoma County Tuesday, December 13, 2011 Simultaneous development of NALF Santa Rosa was more extensive because poor site drainage caused periodic flooding of the Cotati field. Touch-and-go landing practice became the primary activity at the Cotati satellite airfield of the Santa Rosa Auxiliary Naval Air Station. Runway damage from 1945 flooding terminated military flight operations at Cotati despite continuing use of NALF Santa Rosa. Post-War After the Navy declared the airfield excess property, the runways and taxiways were used for automobile drag racing from 1957 to 1972. It was visited by celebrities including Stirling Moss, Jayne Mansfield, and Steve McQueen. Subsequent commercial development of the area obscures locations of former runways and buildings.

Strohl (born March 19, 1946) is a Wisconsin lobbyist and former Majority Leader of the Wisconsin State Senate. He represented Racine County as a Democrat from 1979 through 1991. Biography Joseph Strohl was born on March 19, 1946, in Evanston, Illinois. He graduated from high school in Stephenson, Michigan, received his B.S. from Northern Michigan University and attended graduate school at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. Strohl is married with one child and one stepchild. He worked as a teacher before entering politics. Political career Strohl began his political career working as a legislative aide to Congressman Les Aspin, (WI-01), from 1971 to 1978. In 1978, Strohl challenged 14-year incumbent Wisconsin Senator Henry Dorman in the 21st District Senate Primary. Dorman had been indicted earlier in the year for misuse of state telephone credit cards, and was plagued by other controversies, including a nepotism scandal. Strohl's opponent in the 1978 general election was Sister Michelle Olley, the President of the Racine Unified School Board and a Catholic nun. Olley had been embroiled in a contentious, months-long teachers strike in 1977 which lead to dozens of arrests. Strohl defeated Olley in the general election, held November 7, 1978. He was re-elected in 1982 and 1986, ultimately serving twelve years in the Senate, including four years as Senate Majority Leader. In 1989, Strohl ran into controversy when, as Majority Leader, he prevented a parental consent bill from coming to a vote on the Senate floor. This was exploited in the 1990 election by Strohl's opponent, Racine Unified School Board Member George Petak. Strohl went on to lose that election, held November 6, 1990. Petak took office in 1991, the first time a Republican had held the 21st district senate seat since Edward F. Hilker died in office in 1949. Since leaving the Senate, Strohl has worked as a lobbyist in Madison.

The tune is generally credited to the Rev. Clement Cotteril Scholefield (1839‚Äì1904). It first appeared in Sir Arthur Sullivan's Church Hymns with Tunes (1874). Scholefield was born at Edgbaston, Birmingham, and was the youngest son of William Scholefield, MP for Birmingham. However, in 2000 the Rev. Ian Bradley, reader in Church History and Practical Theology at St Andrews University and author of The Daily Telegraph Book of Hymns, wrote of a connection between Sullivan, who composed the music for Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas and many hymns, among other works both sacred and secular, and Scholefield. \\"The two men were good friends while Sullivan was organist at St Peter's Church, South Kensington, from 1867 to 1872\\". In his book, Bradley writes: Critics of the tune have included Ralph Vaughan Williams, W.H. Frere, the 1897 editor of Hymns Ancient and Modern, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang the latter of whom described it in The Times as a \\"feeble waltz tune\\". Clement Scholefield was educated at Pocklington Grammar School and, after three years at St John's College, Cambridge, he was ordained a deacon in 1867 and a priest in 1869 in the Church of England. From 1869 until 1879, Scholefield served at Hove parish church, St. Peter's in Kensington, as well as a brief tenure at St Luke's Church, Chelsea. He spent the ten years to 1890 as chaplain at Eton College before becoming vicar at Holy Trinity, Knightsbridge, for five years. In 1895 he retired from clergy ministry and devoted his time to various pursuits including music, of which he was particularly fond. He had no systematic musical training but he was an accomplished pianist. He wrote other songs but is remembered for his hymn tunes St Clement and Irene. After his death his estate was administered by the Court of Chancery, and, pending an order being made, the executors were for some time obliged to refuse all applications for the use of St Clement. The tune was used as a theme for the Anne Boleyn section of Rick Wakeman's 1973 concept album, The Six Wives of Henry VIII. \\\\version \\"2.14.2\\" ew Score { ew Staff { \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 3/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\partial 4 d4  b'4( c) b  d4( b) a  g( a) e  g fis e  d2 d4  g4( a) b  a2 g4  fis2 \\\\bar \\"\\" } } }  \\"The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended\\"  St Clement is the second tune for No. 667, \\"The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended\\" (John Ellerton, 1826‚Äì1893) in the 1933 Methodist Hymn Book. In the 1929 Revised Church Hymnary No. 289, (which also incorporates in many editions The Scottish Psalter), it is the third tune for the same hymn. The arrangement and key (A major) is the same in both hymnbooks. It is the official evening hymn of the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. The hymn was selected to be sung as part of the celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 and was also sung at the Hong Kong handover ceremony a century later. The hymn has an enduring popularity, coming in third place in a BBC Songs of Praise poll of favourite hymns in 2005. The tune, with two different translations of Ellerton's text, is also included in German official hymnals, the current Protestant hymnal ' (EG) and the Catholic (Gotteslob, 2013, No. 96).

Early life Baxter was the eldest daughter of John Macmillan Brown, one of the founding professors of Canterbury University College, Christchurch, and Helen Connon, the principal of Christchurch Girls' High School and first woman graduate with honours in the British Empire. Baxter and her sister Viola grew up in a large Fendalton mansion with a governess and lessons from her mother. After her mother died in 1903, Baxter went to live with relatives in Sydney and was educated there at the Presbyterian Ladies' College and at the University of Sydney, graduating with a B.A. in Latin, French and German in 1908. Adult life In 1909, Baxter and her father travelled to England and Europe together. After his return to New Zealand, she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, to study languages, and then went on to Germany to study German and old French. She returned to New Zealand as the First World War was breaking out, and undertook war work for the New Zealand Red Cross and the Lady Liverpool Fund. In mid-1918, a friend showed her a letter written by Archibald Baxter to his parents, describing the punishments he was suffering in France as a conscientious objector. Baxter said of this letter \\"it altered my whole outlook on politics and on everything in life.\\" In 1920, Baxter was offered work at Wellington Girls' College, however her father insisted that she move to Dunedin with him instead. She went, and when Macmillan Brown went away travelling, Baxter taught in his place. While in Otago, Baxter sought out Archibald at his family home in Brighton - they fell in love and were married on 12 February 1921, despite strong opposition from Macmillan Brown at the wide disparity in their backgrounds. The couple bought a farm at Kuri Bush, and farmed there for the next nine years. The Baxters had two sons, Terence in 1922 and Jim in 1926. Jim grew up to become one of New Zealand's foremost poets, James K. Baxter. For the rest of her life, Baxter was involved with pacifism campaigns. In 1931, she and Archie established the Dunedin Branch of the No More War Movement, which aimed to end conscription and encourage disarmament. In the late 1930s the family travelled to Europe and attended the War Resisters' International Conference in Copenhagen, meeting many more pacifists there. Back in New Zealand, conscription was introduced in 1941 and Baxter was a strong supporter of the conscientious objectors, attending their hearings and lobbying Members of Parliament (MPs) and officials for adequate conditions for their detainment. Her son Terence was detained from 1941 to 1945 as an objector, but James was too young to be conscripted. In the 1950s, Baxter's interests moved to nuclear disarmament. She joined the United Nations Association of New Zealand, Amnesty International, and the peace organisation Voice of Women. Also in the 1950s, Baxter returned to her childhood love of botany and nature, nurtured by her parents on \\"educational tours\\" both within New Zealand and abroad. She joined the Dunedin Naturalists' Field Club and organised their field trips, developed her own garden and on a trip to Dunstan with Archie, found a new species of plant - Gingidium baxterii. Later life Archie died in 1970, and Baxter sold their house at Brighton and moved to Kaikorai Valley, in Dunedin. In 1981, she published her autobiography, The Memoirs of Millicent Baxter. Baxter was hospitalised for a broken hip in 1983 and died in 1984. In November 2015, Penny Griffith's biography of Baxter's life was published, \\"Out of the Shadows: The life of Millicent Baxter\\".

Two variants were available in 2010. Design and development The first version of the Evolution, originally designed by Jaroslav Sedl√°ƒâek of the Czech company UL-Jih was marketed by WD Flugzeugleichtbau of Germany as the Dallach D.5 Evolution with series production starting in 2002. UL-Jih fabricated both this model and the earlier D.4 Fascination and claimed sole production and marketing rights to both when WD Flugzeugleichtbau ceased trading in 2005, though those rights are challenged by Swiss Light Aircraft AG who build their own versions. The Evolution is an all-composite aircraft, which uses the same cantilever wings, control surfaces and empennage as the Fascination but has a high-wing configuration, rather than the latter's low wing. The wing is of trapezoidal plan, with ailerons that have external balance trim tabs and sealed nosegaps. Inboard, there are electrically operated Fowler flaps. The fuselage becomes slender towards the tail, where the trapezoidal tailplane is set at mid-height, the elevators having a small cutout for rudder movement. The fin is swept but the rudder has vertical edges; it extends to the bottom of the fuselage. The underwing cabin seats two in side-by-side configuration, with access via glazed side doors. The Evolution has a retractable tricycle undercarriage; all three legs retract rearwards into the fuselage, on which they are mounted. A ballistic recovery parachute is available as an option. The Evolution may be powered either by a 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912ULS or a 59.6 kW (79.9 hp) Rotax 912UL.

Most members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), to which it belongs, are tropical, but R. nepalensis, like other species of Roscoea, grows in much colder mountainous regions. Description Flower of R. nepalensis, in cultivation Roscoea nepalensis is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, \\"pseudostems\\" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. Plants are usually tall, with three to eight leaves. The first one to three consist only of sheaths, which soon split; the remaining leaves form a rosette and have blades usually long by wide (although lengths and widths outside this range are also found). The blades have a short base somewhat resembling a stem. A small ligule is present at the junction of the blade and sheath. Flowers appear in June to July in the wild. The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike (inflorescence) is held within the leaves. The flowers are white. The pale green bracts which subtend the flowers are more or less the same length as the calyx. Each flower has the typical structure for Roscoea (see the diagrams in that article). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx, with a bluntly two-lobed apex. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a tube, long, which protrudes from the calyx and terminates in three lobes, a hooded upright central lobe, about long by wide, and two narrower side lobes, about long by about wide. Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes): two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small upright petals, which are nearly circular, being by , with a more or less central vein; two central staminodes are partially fused at the base to form a broad lip or labellum, long by about wide. The labellum is not bent backwards and is split into two lobes at the end. The single functional stamen has a cream anther, about long, with very short spurs, long, formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther. The stigma is dome-shaped. R. nepalensis does not closely resemble any other species. The small size of the spurs below the anthers are like those of R. alpina. The leaves have similarities to R. debilis in that the blades form rosettes and have narrow stem-like bases. The lateral staminodes of R. nepalensis are unusual in being more or less circular. The species is also unusual in only being known with white flowers. Taxonomy Roscoea nepalensis was first collected in 1952 and was initially confused with R. alpina. It was first described as a new species by Elizabeth Jill Cowley, a botanist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in 1980. The specific epithet nepalensis refers to the plant's occurrence in Nepal. Evolution and phylogeny The family Zingiberaceae is mainly tropical in distribution. The unusual mountainous distribution of Roscoea may have evolved relatively recently as a response to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. Species of Roscoea divide into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a \\"Chinese\\" clade (which includes some species from outside China). The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, their main distributions being divided by the Brahmaputra River as it flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours. R. nepalensis was not included in the phylogenetic analysis by Ngamriabsakul et al.; it falls into the geographical distribution of the Himalayan clade. Distribution and habitat Roscoea nepalensis occurs in Nepal, growing at altitudes of around in grassland, among rocks and in open woodland in the shade of trees and shrubs.

New Nordic Cuisine (, , , ) is a culinary movement which has been developed in the Nordic countries and Scandinavia in particular since the 2000s with Denmark being centre of the movement. New Nordic Cuisine was propelled by and found inspiration in ideas and a manifesto written by food activist and entrepreneur Claus Meyer and a number of Scandinavian chefs in 2004 in Copenhagen. New Nordic Cuisine has been used to promote local, natural and seasonal produce as a basis for new dishes both in restaurants and in the home. As a result, a number of Denmark's restaurants have introduced local ingredients, some often new to the usual palate, in combination with traditional foods prepared in new ways. History In November 2004, on the initiative of the Danish chefs Ren√© Redzepi and Claus Meyer of the then newly opened Noma restaurant, chefs and food professionals from all the Nordic countries met in Copenhagen to discuss how best to develop what they called the \\"New Nordic Cuisine\\". In particular, they sought to emphasize the need for what they described as \\"purity, simplicity and freshness\\" as well as increased use of seasonal foods. Restaurants were encouraged to develop traditional dishes making use of ingredients benefitting from the local region‚Äôs climate, water and soil.\\"New Nordic Cuisine\\", Nordic Council of Ministers. Retrieved 12 December 2011, Meeting in Copenhagen in 2005, the Nordic Council's agricultural and food ministers from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and dependent territories gave their support to these developments, launching what they called the \\"new Nordic Food Programme\\". In 2006, this led to the funding of EUR 3 million for a number of related activities. Approach The evolving cuisine has sought to take advantage of the possibilities inherent in traditional Scandinavian recipes for fish and meat dishes, building on the use of local products while reviving and adapting some of the older techniques, for example, those for marinating, smoking and salting. Products such as rapeseed, oats, cheeses and older varieties of apples and pears are now being prepared with greater attention to safeguarding their natural flavours. These steps have been taken by the proponents of the New Nordic Cuisine in parallel with their awareness of a growing interest in organic foods throughout the region. In addition to concerns for \\"purity and freshness\\", they have also aimed to make maximum use of seasonal produce such as new potatoes, strawberries and asparagus in the summer and baked goods and seasoned meats during the Christmas period.\\"Denmark Special\\" , Food & design, #9 2011. Retrieved 11 December 2011. Claus Meyer has supported the campaign, not only in restaurants but also for food production in the Nordic region. The Swedish chef Magnus Nilsson has also pioneered the New Nordic Cuisine, and his approach, also includes the documentation and reviving of traditional cooking from across the Nordic region altogether. Restaurants Since its opening, Copenhagen's Noma restaurant (short for nordisk mad meaning Nordic food) has been a flagship for and at the forefront of developing and materializing the ideas behind the New Nordic Cuisine. Aiming to serve dishes prepared under guidelines drawn up for the new cuisine it was repeatedly awarded the title of \\"world's best restaurant\\" in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014 by the Restaurant magazine, supported by the San Pellegrino mineral water company.\\"Noma\\" , The S.Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants. Retrieved 9 December 2011. Other restaurants in Copenhagen and the provinces have followed the trend, attracting increasing interest at home and abroad.Betty Hallock, \\"Savoring the rise of New Nordic Cuisine in Copenhagen\\", Los Angeles Times, 5 September 2010. Retrieved 12 December 2011. Among those who have adopted the new approach to cooking are Ti Trin Ned in Fredericia, Geranium in Copenhagen and former Restaurant Malling & Schmidt in Aarhus. Magnus Nilsson's small restaurant F√§viken in rural Sweden closed in 2019 but has been very influential in developing and inventing New Nordic Cuisine.

During this period the club did not employ a 'manager' but Nicholson undertook many of the duties currently associated with a modern-day football manager. Born in Attercliffe in Sheffield, Nicholson was originally a lawyer's clerk who was active with the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA as well as secretary of Attercliffe F.C. In 1899 he was offered the post of club secretary at Sheffield United when the club became a Limited Company and remained in the role until his death. Although the team was coached by a trainer and selected by a committee, Nicholson ran the club on a day-to-day basis, dealing with transfers and other finances, liaising with the Football Association and looking after the players' general affairs. Regarded as one of the most respected men in football at the time he had a vast number of contacts throughout the game and was an expert in the rules, laws and regulations of the sport. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in The Blades history, winning four FA Cups in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925 (also reaching the final in 1901,1936) and maintaining United as a dominant league force, winning the old 1st division Championship in 1898. Despite never holding the post of manager at The Blades, he was offered just such a position at Manchester City in 1926 but turned it down, preferring to remain in his home town. Nicholson died in 1932 after being knocked down by a lorry whilst crossing the road outside Sheffield Midland Station on his way to join the team, who were heading off to Birmingham to play a match against Aston Villa.

In contemporary orchestras, it was usual to not write in the parts for the bassoons and harpsichord, and they would simply double the cellos and double basses if they were available in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line and act as the continuo; however, the bassoons in this symphony do not simply double the cellos and double basses. The duration is approximately 13 minutes. The symphony consists of the following movements: #Allegro moderato, , A minor #Andantino, , A major #Rondo: Allegro moderato, , A minor History and attribution The Leipzig publisher Breitkopf & H√§rtel tried to publish all of Mozart's works in 1799. They collected Mozart's works from his sister, his wife, musicians, copyists and other publishers. Among them was the symphony in A minor, K. 16a. In the handwritten catalogue of Breitkopf & H√§rtel there is a four-bar-long incipit of this symphony, with the source reported to be the Hamburg music dealer Johann Christoph Westphal. In the K√∂chel catalogue, Ludwig Ritter von K√∂chel considered the work to be lost and placed it in the Anhang, assigning it the number K. Anh. 220.Neal Zaslaw: Symphony in A minor, K. 16a/Anh. 220. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Symphonies Vol VII. Recording of the Academy of Ancient Music. Concertmaster: Jaap Schr√∂der, Continuo: Christopher Hogwood. Decca Record, London 1988. Alfred Einstein suggested in his edition of the K√∂chel catalogue that the symphony was composed in 1765 in London, based on the incipit and Mozart's first surviving symphony, K. 16. He gave the work the K√∂chel number 16a and stated that the early time of composition is obviously recognisable even from the few surviving bars. The sixth edition of the K√∂chel catalogue merely repeated this. This symphony in A minor was discovered as a copy (not an autograph) in the handwriting of several copyists in the archives of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra in Odense, Denmark in 1982. Volker Scherliess: Die Sinfonien. In: Silke Leopold (editor): Mozart-Handbuch. B√§renreiter-Verlag, Kassel 2005, . A note on the title page indicates that this symphony entered the possession of the Danish Collegium Musicum (probably from Westphal) by 1793 at the latest, with the watermark in the paper of the orchestral parts showing the date 1779. None of the copyists in the Mozart family circle could have copied this symphony. In the 1780s, Westphal had some authentic Mozart symphonies and some works with \\"dubious\\" sources such as K. 16a and K. Anh.C 11.08. K. 16a was probably among the works he sold to the Danish Collegium Musicum. Wolfgang Plath published the symphony, now known as the \\"Odense\\" symphony, and put it in a scientific symposium for the experts. The symphony was recorded firstly in 1984 by the Odense Symphony Orchestra and the conductor Tam√°s Vet≈ë, then by the Academy of Ancient Music and was included in the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe under \\"Works of Doubtful Authenticity\\" in 2000 because the authenticity debate was then not yet complete, especially since an alternative to Mozart as the author could still not be named. Neal Zaslaw stated that the symphony was probably composed later than 1765, and that the stylistic proximity to other Mozart symphonies of the 1760s and 1770s make accurate dating impossible without an authentic source and that K. 16a was often different stylistically from all other Mozart works. Wolfgang Gersthofer ignored K. 16a in his review of Mozart's early symphonies because most experts did not consider it authentic Mozart.Wolfgang Gersthofer: Sinfonien KV 16‚Äì134. In: Joachim Br√ºgge, Claudia Maria Knispel (edits.): Das Mozart-Handbuch, Band 1: Mozarts Orchesterwerke und Konzerte. Laaber-Verlag, Laaber 2007, , pp. 15‚Äì27. Volker Scherliess stated that after long and intensive discussion, Mozart experts have agreed that the \\"Odense\\" symphony cannot be considered a work of Mozart in both tradition and style. Deleted movement once thought to be for this symphony On the back of the fourth page of the autograph of the Wind Divertimento in B major, K. 186/159b, there are 16 crossed-out bars for strings, 2 oboes and 2 horns. Alfred Einstein, in his edition of the K√∂chel catalogue, thought this was an Andante in E major belonging to a symphony written much earlier, perhaps to the (then undiscovered) K. 16a. The sixth edition of the K√∂chel catalogue largely repeated this, but reworded it to imply that the association remained uncertain. Wolfgang Plath dated the divertimento to 1772, but the 16 bars to 1765 or 1766 based on the handwriting. He also corrected the key to G minor and thought that Mozart later reused this piece of paper for the final version of the Minuet and Trio from the divertimento. Franz Giegling transcribed these bars and his transcription was printed in the critical report to the NMA (Neue Mozart- Ausgabe) volume of wind divertimenti (published in 1987), which he edited.Unbezeichnetes Orchesterst√ºck in gis KV6 deest: Score in the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe By then, the K. 16a symphony had been discovered and Einstein's connection had been disproved (since the Andante was in G minor, any work it belonged to would probably have to be in B major). Neal Zaslaw printed a reconstruction of this \\"orchestral draft\\", stating that the draft contained internal inconsistencies and errors and that the reconstruction was based on the assumption that Mozart was hearing the piece in G minor and B major, but could not write it correctly as he had not yet learned some necessary aspects of musical notation, such as double sharps.MozartForum: K016a ‚Äì The Symphony in a-minor \\"del Sigr.

Life and career Born L√©ontine Van der Ma√´sen d'Avionpuits in Esneux, Belgium, she was the daughter of the crown prosecutor in Verviers. Her father died when she was still a young girl, and after his death she entered the Royal Conservatory of Li√®ge where she studied singing with Th√©ophile Vercken.

After performances in Lille, she was engaged by L√©on Carvalho for his Th√©√¢tre Lyrique company in Paris, where in 1863 she created the role of Le√Øla in Bizet's Les p√™cheurs de perles. Her performance in the premiere was a sensation with the audience, according to the critic in Le Guide musical, who went on to praise \\"the beauty of her voice, the perfection of her singing, her personal charm, and her talent as actress.\\"Ruelle (8 October 1863) p.3.

In the late 1860s she married Alfred Rabaud, a wealthy businessman and patron of the arts from Marseille, and retired from the stage. With her husband she ran a salon frequented by many young composers of the day and devoted herself to charity in her later years. Alfred Rabaud died in 1886.

The phrase is used to describe the negative connotations of children's influence in their parents' buying habits. Due to children's buying influence growing in line with average household income, some commentators now refer to the home as being a \\"filiarchy\\" due to the power that children may hold in the household's consumer choices. This makes pester power relevant for the modern household. Pester power is commonly used by marketing companies to target the 4‚Äì6 years old category as they have limited disposable income of their own, and consequently do not have the means to buy goods themselves. The growth of the issue of pester power is directly related to the rise of child advertising. Mr. Potato Head was the first children's toy to be advertised on television; this aired in 1952 and paved the way for pester power, as pitching to children was seen to be an innovative new idea. It is now a convention for children's products to be directly marketed at children. Through pester power, children have assumed role of being the \\"ultimate weapon\\" in influencing family spending because of the how they consistently nag their parents. As a result, children have been likened to being a \\"Trojan horse\\" within the modern household for marketing companies. One key criticism of pester power is that it implies repeated nagging by the child. However, young children may not be eloquent enough to have any other feasible methods of persuasion, and consequently the notion that adverts are specifically designed to encourage young children to nag could be argued not to be the case. Targeting The average child in the United States sees more than 3,000 advertisements per day across a variety of different media forms (as of 1999) and the average Mexican Child will see 12,000 adverts for junk food every year. Consequently, different methodologies are employed in order to maximize a child's influence in a household's purchasing habits. Exploiting Pester Power as a marketing tool to try to influence buying habits can take more than one form, crucially as the \\"way a child nags isn't always the same\\". Indeed, there are a large array of different ways in which children can pester. Studies identify different methods of nagging/pestering to try to achieve the marketers desired goal of the child influencing the parents to buy the product. In the 2011 issue of the Journal of Children and Media the three main types of nagging are identified as: juvenile nagging, nagging to test boundaries, and manipulative nagging. The trend was that both nagging as a whole and manipulative nagging significantly increasing with age. Another study suggests that there are two main ways children pester their parents. The first method is persistent nagging, which is said to be whiny where the child tries to get what they want by being badly behaved until they succeed. This is contrasted with importance nagging where the child rationally demands the good and shows why that product is particularly important, for instance identifying the benefit of a specific toy in relation to others, for example completing a set. These strategies are employed in different circumstances to try to circumvent various different types of parental guards against pestering. Joel Bakan, author of The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, identifies four different parent types who can all be influenced in different ways. First are bare necessities parents, who are financially able to pander to the whims of the children; these parents are likely only to give in if the child can demonstrate a need or benefit of the product. This contrasts with the three more easily influenced parent types, \\"Kids Pals\\", \\"Indulgers\\" and \\"Conflicteds\\". Kids Pals are identified as being relaxed and young, Indulgers seem to buy their children's affection, making up for their lack of parental contact time, and thirdly the Conflicteds who don't deliberately impulse buy, but continue to do so anyway; this group is more likely to submit to persistence. Indeed, when parents say 'no' they are often then subjected to family conflict and strife. The scale of the issue is widespread as 74% of households said that pester power impacted on their buying habits. Furthermore, the age at which children are targeted is reducing, in a ploy to retain the child's loyalty as the child grows up to try to build a loyal buyer base. McNeal spoke of \\"brand name preference\\" being crucial from an early age, which is validated by Mike Searles, the former president of Toys \\"R\\" Us, who said \\"[I]f you own this child at an early age... you can own this child for years to come\\". Combating One method of stopping pester power is in the home. In studies where mothers have been interviewed about their methods for limiting the effectiveness of pester power, 36% said \\"limiting commercial exposure\\" was effective whilst another 35% said explaining why the children could have not have the product was their preferred method to reduce the nagging. Other than parental controls of pester power the other obvious way is banning child advertisement. For instance, Sweden and Norway forbid all advertising to those under 12, in Greece advertising toys is illegal until 10pm. In Sweden, a notable example was that the Pok√©mon cartoon series had to mute its saying \\"gotta catch 'em all\\", as this was said to be stealth advertising and an attempt to influence children into pestering their parents to buy the playing cards for them. Stealth advertising is a threat as children who are younger than eight are unable to recognise whether there is an intent to sell a product. this presents problems when TV shows have their own lines of merchandise which are not explicitly advertised. Indeed in the UK the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) condemned an advert by Morrisons in 2011 which featured children being able to win a chance to Disneyland when their parents shopped at Morrisons. This later was stopped on the grounds that the advert showed children pestering their parents to take them to Morrisions and it was feared that the children could mimic these actions. In the UK no advert is permitted \\"to encourage [children] to ask their parents, guardians or other person to buy or enquire about a product or service for them\\"; this is an example of UK legislation directly attempting to combat Pester Power. Concerns A key concern of pester power is its effect on childhood obesity. As the products which are promoted to children are pre-sugared cereals, soft drinks, savoury snacks, confectionery and fast food, which in turn are some of the most calorie-dense of all food articles. Indeed, 63% of the U.S. marketing budget for children was spent on carbonated beverages, fast foods and cereals. The World Health Organisation said \\"it is probable that the heavy advertising of fast foods and energy dense foods and drinks increases the consumption of those products\\". Dina Borzekowski from Bloomberg School's Department of health recommended, \\"[T]o address childhood obesity, it may be necessary to limit the amount of food and beverage advertising shown on commercial television and other media, as this may lessen children's nagging for unhealthy items.\\" Conversely Lawlor and Prothero argue that the \\"parent‚Äìchild interaction\\" when concerning buying habits is not as large a problem as it can be perceived to be, or indeed, maybe it is predictable in a family environment, where conflicting interests are expected. Some drivers of pester power in various countries are: * More working women and consequently more dual income families. * Grandparents' increasing role in bringing up children because of working mothers. Grandparents are the fastest-growing income sources for the children. * Rise in the number of single parent households. Research supports that children in single parent households make their first purchases almost a year earlier than their two-parent household counterparts. * Delayed parenthood. * Greater exposure to kids: there is an ever-increasing exposure to kids both in terms of technology and mass media. * The pang and guilt of not being able to spend much quality time with children is compensated by smothering them with material goods. * Hurried child syndrome and hyper- parenting: parents today overscheduled their children's life with a heavy dose of academics and extracurricular activities, forcing the little adults to excel both at school and extra academics. * The \\"askable\\" parent: communication between parents and children has opened up considerably and the stereotypical roles have become rarer. * Growth of retail sector. * Kids channels: a newer phenomenon.

In 1994-95, McCubbins was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and for AY 2013 - 14 he was a W. Glenn Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellow and the Robert Eckles Swain National Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.  Research  McCubbins who also writes under the pseudonym McNollgast,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=mcnollgast&btnG;=&hl;=en&as;_sdt=0%2C34 with Roger G Noll and Barry R Weingast, is perhaps best known for his work on the actions of legislatures. He put forth the argument that legislative majorities control the veto gates in the legislature which allows them to block unfavorable bills and, thus, allows them to decide what gets voted on and what doesn't. He has also argued that legislatures enact administrative procedure as an instrument of political control. Administrative procedure can be used to stack the deck in terms of who is likely to win and who is likely to lose in rulemaking. McCubbins also argued that legislatures rely on \\"fire- alarm\\" oversight, which devolves some of the oversight costs to citizens, rather than through the much less efficient, \\"police-patrol oversight,\\" wherein legislators hold hearings to acquire information. The trick is how lawmakers can use administrative procedure to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for citizens to be willing and able to oversee agency rulemaking and to bring agency malfeasance to the attention of lawmakers. A consequence of these widespread use of these tools, he argues, is that Congress has much more power over agency action that is often argued. He has also studied political communication at its most basic level through use of experiments, by deriving and testing the necessary and sufficient conditions whereby one individual will listen to, trust, be persuaded by, and learn from another individual, and thus when, in turn, they will be able to use what they learn to make reasoned decisions. His most recent experiments have explored the limits of game theory as a tool for understanding cognition. He has also studied group decision making, modeling the interaction as a network, and showing through a set of novel experiments that networks aid the ability of groups to successfully undertake tasks when network interactions are cheap, tasks are easy, network participants share common interest in the outcome, participants have sufficient information about how their and others actions affect outcomes on the network, or the network participants are highly connected. In these latter experiments, McCubbins again examines how the structure of institutions, such as those defined by administrative procedure or by contracts, affects the information environment and thus affects the ability of people to undertake collective action. He has also argued that while groups can propose and enact popular initiatives and referendums, they only infrequently have the ability to oversee the implementation of policies enacted through direct initiatives and thus direct initiatives rarely affect policy and thus only rarely affect what the legislature would otherwise enact. McCubbins has demonstrate the ineffectiveness of tax and expenditure limitations or TELs.

The screenplay was written by Vincent Nebrida. It tells the story of five Filipino-American friends living in New York City dealing with love, sex, friendship, careers, and cultural identity. The title was derived from adobo, a very popular dish in the Philippines. The film was released on January 16, 2002 in the Philippines and January 25 in the United States. Plot Tere Sanchez (Cherry Pie Picache) is an accountant who is in her early forties, single, and not especially happy about it. Tere is an excellent cook, and often throws dinner parties for her friends, and the arrival of her old friend Lorna (Sol Oca) from Manila is all the reason she needs to invite her friends over for a feast. Mike (Christopher De Leon) is a former political journalist who is now enjoying the fruits of a lucrative career as a newspaper editor, but he wonders if he left his principles behind along the way; he's also feeling unfulfilled in his marriage to Gigi (Susan Valdez-LeGoff). Gerry (Ricky Davao) is an advertising copywriter who is afraid to tell his friends and family that he's gay, though circumstances may well drive him out of the closet. Raul (Paolo Montalban) is a good-looking womaniser who prefers to date Caucasians, and lacks a certain amount of emotional maturity. And Marissa (Dina Bonnevie) is on the surface a well-to-do social butterfly; however, deep inside she's woefully insecure, and is afraid to confront her boyfriend Sam (Randy Becker) about his constant infidelity. Meanwhile, Lorna confesses that while she's married to a wealthy man in Manila, she's terribly unhappy, and is considering staying in America as an illegal alien.

Acidic vinegar, salty soy sauce, meat, salt, pepper, all are combined in a pot to produce adobo. In the film, despite the conflicts in their characters, in the end, everything ended up well, just like a well cooked adobo. Production The film started out with a conversation in 1995 between Tony Gloria and Vincent Nebrida that there should be films depicting Filipino life in the US. Two months later Vincent finished a screenplay called \\"Magic Adobo\\" but only received attention from movie executives in April 1999, after four years since its conception. The entire movie was filmed in chilly October 2000 on location in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island, including a summertime pool party scene which required the actors, who were shivering between takes, to wear skimpy bathing suits outdoors. The scenes were filmed over a span of twenty days. Release The film has been Rated-R by the MPAA for sexual situations, nudity and strong language. Box office The film had a very limited release in the United States on January 25, 2002 in 7 theaters for 3 consecutive days. The crew acquired a Mayor's permit to shut down the Queensboro Bridge for the premiere night of the film. The film gross $41,001 on its opening day ranking it on 54th spot and by 3 days of screening the film went on to gross a total of $342,855 in the United States. The film was released on VHS and on DVD on May 30, 2003 by First Look Pictures. The DVD featured an English and Spanish subtitles. Reception Most of the reviews have been mixed. In review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds a rating of 30% or an average score of 4.6 out of 10 based on 23 reviews with the consensus of: \\"The characters and situations seem borrowed from overwrought sitcoms.\\" In Metacritic which assigns a normalized 0‚Äì100 rating to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 30 based on 10 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Critical reviews John Anderson of the New York Newsday stated that \\"American Adobo is a tasty dish of a movie. A tender film with genuine insight into the urban heart. The way it treats the totally non-ethnic aspects of life--love, loneliness, dying, friendship--is what makes this Filipino film so attractive and also so American.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times stated that, \\"American Adobo is an intimate, good-humored comedy with lots of heart. Delicious and very funny!\\" while Andy Klein of San Francisco Weekly stated that, \\"American Adobo is sophisticated and entertaining. A solid step forward for the emerging Philippine-American cinema.\\" Oliver Carnay of Asian Journal stated that \\"[the film] is rich, funny and entertaining. A gem reminiscent of Eat Drink Man Woman.\\" The National Board Review was also very positive about the film saying, \\"A wonderful movie with a lot of heart. Among the year's top foreign language films\\" while Stephen Holden of The New York Times was less positive about the film stating that, \\"American Adobo certainly doesn't lack emotional energy, but it has two or three more plots than it can handle and plays like a compressed, strident soap opera.\\" Accolades Official selection *2002 San Diego Asian Film Festival *2002 Los Angeles Cinema Indios Festival *2003 Women's International Film Festival, South Korea *2003 Fukuoka International Film Festival, Japan Los Angeles Cinema Indios Festival *Winner best actor for Christopher De Leon *Winner special achievement award Star Awards *Nominated best actor for Ricky Davao *Nominated best new actor for Paolo Montalban FAMAS Awards *Winner best supporting actress for Cherry Pie Picache Gawad Urian Awards *Nominated best actor for Ricky Davao *Nominated best actress for Cherry Pie Picache *Nominated best actress for Dina Bonnevie *Nominated best director for Laurice Guillen Filipino Heritage Awards *Winner most promising talent, Paolo Montalban Extreme Awards *Nominated best picture References External links *Official  Category:Philippine films Category:Star Cinema films Category:English-language films Category:Tagalog-language films Category:Filipino-American films Category:Films set in the United States ","title":"American Adobo"},{"id":"34055324","title":"AACTA Award for Best Feature Length Documentary"},{"id":"34055340","text":"Erbessa cassandra is a moth of the family Notodontidae first described by Herbert Druce in 1885.

Environmental mega conferences differ from small environmental and sustainability conferences in fundamental ways. Rather than focusing on specific regional problems such as acid rain or ‚Äòsectoral‚Äô problems such as human health or food, they try to take a synoptic overview of the relationship between human society and the natural world.Seyfang, G., and Jordan, A., 2002, ‚ÄòThe Johannesburg Summit and Sustainable Development: How Effective Are Environmental Conferences?‚Äô, in Olav Schram Stokke and √òystein B. Thommessen (eds.), Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2002/2003 (London: Earthscan Publications), 19‚Äì39. They aim to; ‚Äúfirstly address the overall trajectory of human development and its relationship with the environment as a whole and secondly take a broader view of the complex environment and development issues over a longer time frame, as each summit is preceded by a number of pre-conferences‚Äù.Seyfang, G., 2003. Environmental mega-conferences‚Äîfrom Stockholm to Johannesburg and beyond, Global Environmental Change 13 (3), pp. 224 A Short History There have been 4 environmental mega conferences to date; United Nations (UN) Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE) 1972 (commonly known as the Stockholm conference); UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) 1992 (also known as Rio Conference or Earth Summit); UN General Assembly Special Session on Sustainable Development in New York 1997 (Earth Summit II) and World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) 2002 in Johannesburg. Pressure for a global environmental mega conference had been building since the mid-1960s as cross boundary problems such as air and water pollution raised awareness of the need for international cooperation. This was emphasised by the first pictures of Earth taken from space. A Swedish representative first proposed the idea in 1968 at the Economic and Social Council Biosphere meeting hosted by the UN; Sweden at the time was under a lot of political domestic pressure to tackle the issue of acid rain and offered to host the proposed environmental mega- conference. Stockholm was the very first global meeting about a single issue; it was the first coordinated attempt to discuss an international issue at a global level. Since Stockholm, mega conferences have been held on many global issues such as health, women and human settlements. It was a groundbreaking advancement in this respect and provided a stage for future environmental mega conferences to set global agendas and provide global leadership. Media Exposure Environmental mega conferences are large scale and high profile. They capture the attention of the world‚Äôs‚Äô media due to the breadth of issues they cover and the notable stakeholders they attract. They command the headlines surrounding the event and allow environmental activists, non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and the public to apply domestic pressure on the outcomes as environmental issues take centre stage. The role of the media is important in setting global agendas.Anders, H., 1993. The Mass Media and Environmental Issues. London: Leicester University PressMazur. A., 1994, Risk 5: 189-280 The time around these conferences allow the global media and governments to focus on strategic issues and link problems such poverty, health, environment and trade together by creating global debate and publicizing sustainability issues. For conferences such as the WSSD (World Summit on sustainable Development), much of the media attention it received was focused on its failures rather than what it had achieved. This may be, in part, attributable to a lack of understanding as the public are arguably unfamiliar with the term ‚Äòsustainable development‚Äô. Reporting on this topic is sporadic, almost non existentVoisy, H., and Church, C., 2000. Media coverage of sustainable development and local agenda 21. In The Daily Globe: environmental change the public and the media. 2000, Wales, Ebbw Vale: Earthscan Publications Ltd. and any progress made (since the Rio conference in 1992 and the Brudtland report) is done so on to a backdrop of the sustainable development rhetoric. These conferences have, to some extent, also become a focus for protests from a wide range of actors and activists who use the media coverage to highlight their own views.Kingsnorth, P. 2004, One no, Many yeses: A Journey to the Heart of the Global Resistance Movement. London: The Free PressMunnik, V., and Wilson, J., 2003, The World Comes to One Country: an Insider History of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg 2002. Johannesburg: Heinrich Boll Foundation For example, thousands of demonstrators marched in Durban on 3 December 2011 at the annual UN conference on climate change, angered by the stance taken by rich countries such as Canada and America.Black, R., 2011. Protests at climate change summit in Durban, BB [online] Accessed: 8 December 2011. Available at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16021217 This negative media spotlight affects business and NGO involvement too as ‚Äòmany of the potentially controversial partnerships [type II partnerships, see below], particularly those involving corporations, held their meetings on the outskirts of the Summit [World Summit on sustainable Development], fearing bad publicity‚Äô.La Vina, A.G.G.M, Hoff, G., and DeRose, A.M., 2003. The Outcomes of Johannesburg: Assessing the World Summit on Sustainable Development, SAIS Review 23 (1) pp. 53-70 Stakeholders and Partnerships Environmental mega conferences have made efforts to challenge their ‚Äòelitist and remote‚Äô label by becoming more inclusive over time; increased inclusivity increases legitimacy. There is a wide range of stakeholders in attendance at these conferences. Along with well over 100 governments attending (at Rio 172 attended with 108 sending their head of state), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are present, businesses also send representatives together with major stakeholder groups representing; women, youth, indigenous people, local authorities, trade unions, farmers and scientific and technological communities. This formal participation process means these smaller stakeholder groups do not have to rely on unofficial ‚Äòside events‚Äô to provide a proxy input from global civil society. Type I and type II partnerships were produced at WSSD. Type I referred to a series of legally binding intergovernmental commitments designed to aid states in the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals.Death, Carl (2009). Governing Sustainable Development: Partnerships, Protests and Power at the World Summit. Abingdon: Routledge. Type II partnerships, are collaborations between national or sub-national governments, private sector actors and civil society actors who form voluntary transnational agreements in order to meet specific sustainable development goals;Baker, S., 2006. Sustainable Development. Abingdon: Routledge. they challenge the traditional state centered eco- governmentality approach to tackling sustainable development. Hundreds of these alliances were announced at WSSD and this brought NGOs and business firmly into the spotlight of global environmental governance. Global North/South Divide There are critics who state that these conferences provide new arenas in which old grievances about human consumption (in the North) and population growth (in the South) can be articulated with much greater clarity and volume.Grubb, M., Koch, M., Thomson, K., Munson, A., and Sullivan, F., 1993. The ‚ÄòEarth Summit‚Äô Agreements: A Guide and Assessment (London: Earthscan Publications). The UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) states that since Rio ‚Äúthere has been a steady decline in the environment. One of the key driving forces has been the growing gap between rich and poor\\". Existing political positions are polarised and not reconciled under the media spotlight. One of the stated aims of the WSSD was ‚Äòthe reinvigoration of the global commitment to a North/South partnership and higher level of international solidarity and to the accelerated implementation of Agenda 21 and the promotion of sustainable development‚ÄôUN ‚Äì United Nations: 2002, World Summit on Sustainable Development. Plan of Implementation (17b). yet its impact on multilateralism was arguably negligible; overshadowed by the events of 9/11, the subsequent ‚ÄòWar on Terror‚Äô and American unilateralism.Death, C., 2008. No WSSD + 5? Global Environmental Diplomacy in the Twenty-First Century, Environmental Politics, 17(1) pp. 121-125 The WSSD was boycotted by George W. Bush, then the American president, who was on holiday at the time of the conference, and Tony Blair, then the British prime minister, attended for just one day.Pearce, F., 2002, Summit opens with little optimism [online] Accessed 5 December 2010 Available at: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2719-summit-opens-with-little- optimism.html This apparent lack of interest of high-profile, global North world leaders does nothing to bridge the North/South divide, especially when conferences such as these potentially have great potential to do so. It also risks undermining the significance of such conferences and reduces the political credibility. Furthermore, this ‚Äògrowing gap‚Äô of inequality between the two global regions have been said to be highlighted by the type II partnership initiative. Partnerships must fulfill two essential criteria to be effective; mutuality- interdependence and equality between partners, and organizational identity- the equal maintenance of each partner‚Äôs missions and goals.Brinkerhoff, D.W.; Brinkerhoff, J.M. (2004). \\"Partnerships between international donors and non-governmental development organizations: opportunities and constraints\\". Review of Administrative Sciences 70 (2): pp. 253‚Äì270. [online]. Accessed: 8 December 2011 Available at:http://ras.sagepub.com/content/70/2/253.short However, in a type II partnership between Northern and Southern actors, the former will inevitably contribute greater financial and material resources to the partnership therefore creating a power inequality, enabling increased control and impairing the mutuality necessary for the partnership to function successfully. To counter this, it is necessary to ensure that a ‚Äòcontribution‚Äô within a type II partnership can include knowledge, skills and other relevant strengths, rather than only financial and material resources, to redress the balance of power within the partnership. The Six Core Functions Seyfang and Jordan (2002) have identified six core functions which these mega conferences seek to perform; # Setting global agendas # Facilitating ‚Äòjoined- up‚Äô thinking # Endorsing common principles # Providing global leadership # Building institutional capacity # Legitimising global governance through inclusivity Some are more successful than others as discussed below. Setting global agendas Through the aforementioned media attention surrounding these conferences and subsequent public debate and domestic political pressure, environmental issues have not only made it onto the global political agenda but have maintained their position there. They serve in uniting otherwise disconnected issues and UN is probably the only forum where global dimensions of common problems such as sustainable development can be adequately resolved. For example, the Stockholm conference (the first environmental mega conference) successfully identified the terms of reference of what is now a continuing global environmental debate and fused the simmering conflict between the environment and development. Facilitating ‚ÄòJoined-up‚Äô Thinking Discussing interconnected issues of sustainable development problems on a global scale demands joined-up thinking. Mega conferences offer a forum outside normal short-term political agendas for governments and stakeholders to address wide ranging, integrated issues. In reality, this is difficult to achieve. Their huge scope and all encompassing agenda makes it impossible to ‚Äúunpick the intricacies‚ÄùSeyfang, G., and Jordan, A., 2002, ‚ÄòThe Johannesburg Summit and Sustainable Development: How Effective Are Environmental Conferences?‚Äô, in Olav Schram Stokke and √òystein B. Thommessen (eds.), Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2002/2003 (London: Earthscan Publications), 19‚Äì39. pp. 23 of sustainable development issues and even in this arena, some aspects, such as trade, remain off the agenda (an issue addressed by the World Trade Organization and World Bank instead). Attempts to achieve joined-up thinking have increased progressively; the issues raised at Rio and Johannesburg were considerably more wide ranging than at Stockholm, arguably aided by the sustainable development discourse. However, in this quest for comprehensiveness, it is increasingly harder to pull specific issues into focus. Endorsing Common Principles Environmental mega conferences have been criticised as being little more than high profile, hugely expensive talking shops which give the illusion that the world is changing when it is not.Fomerand, J., 1996, UN Conferences: Media Events or Genuine Diplomacy; 2 Global Governance 361 They have produced so little concrete change due to the voluntary nature of the agreements, the difficulty in monitoring and the lack of follow up regarding compliance. However, they have produced important and authoritative ‚Äòsoft laws‚Äô, the halfway stage on the road to legally binding frameworks.Dupuy, Pierre-Marie, 12 Mich. J. Int'l L. 420 (1990-1991) Soft Law and the International Law of the Environment; There is the strong expectation of nations adhering to soft laws and that they will become ‚Äòharder‚Äô in the short or long term, more precise and more legally binding.Birnie and Boyle, 1992, International law and the Environment. Oxford: Clarendon Press For example, many principles agreed upon at the Stockholm conference now form the basis of national, regional and EU laws. This is not that surprising as Stockholm was the first of the mega conferences and was treading new territory; policy makers and governments, now that common principles have been established, are attempting to move onto more definitive detailed action plans. Providing Global Leadership Mega conferences provide a stage for global leadership. One of the best examples of this is the Agenda 21 agreement evolving from the Rio summit which gave a blueprint for action at lower levels of governance. The type II partnerships created at WSSD also demonstrate a strong ‚Äòtake home‚Äô action plan carrying the weight of global agreement. However, it is questionable how well mega conferences adhere to the subsidiary principle (the idea that problems should be addressed at the lowest effective level of governance). The EU, through the integration of the concept of sustainable development in internal and international policies and development strategy, has been able to offer leadership and ‚Äòcarry the sustainable development flag on the international scene'.Baldock, S., 2003. The EU sustainable development strategy: from Lisbon to Goteburg and beyond- an evaluation of progress. Report prepared for the European and Social Committee, institute for the European environmental policy, Brussels. pp.7 Many have cited the EU as important actors in providing this leadership.Wallstrom, M., 2002a, A wake up call from global sustainability. Speech at European Policy Centre Dialogue ‚ÄòSustainability and Globalisation: Towards Johannesburg‚Äô, 26 February 2002, Brussels.FoEE, 2002. EU loses earth summit leadership role. Press release: 28 August 2002 The mega conferences forces the ‚ÄòEU policy to interact with other political structures and actors‚ÄôKellow, A., and Zito, A., 2002. Steering throguht complexity: EU environmental regulation in the international context. Political Studies 50 (1) pp. 44 and the conversion of ‚Äòsoft laws‚Äô into hard EU policies and laws demonstrates leadership that could be replicated in other areas of the world (for example, in the African Union); which would surely be a huge success for future environmental mega conferences. Building Institutional Capacity Past mega conferences addressing a range of issues have led to the creation of new institutional bodies such as the UN, UNEP and the Commission on Sustainable Development. Maurice Strong, who headed the Stockholm conference and an advocate of environmental mega conferences, believes that the ‚Äòprocess is the policy‚Äô;Haas, P., 2002. UN Conferences and Constructivist Governance of the Environment pp. 81-87 that mega conferences are ‚Äòone contribution to a much larger process of societal and institutional change, rather that one-off, isolated events‚Äô.Jordan and Voisey, 1998. The Rio Process, 93 Despite the slow pace and continual frustrations that critics highlight, there is inexorable forward movement; they are important yardsticks which domestic pressure groups can use to maintain influence and conference after conference builds a cycle of ever increasing domestic commitment. However, there are criticisms that these new institutions are weak both financially and legally and calls have been made for them to be vested with far greater legal and administrative powers in order to function better as engines of sustainability.Tritten, J., Eid, U., M√ºller-Kraenner, S., and Greger, N., 2001. From Rio to Johannesburg: Contributions to the Globalization of Sustainability (Berlin: Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation); Bigg and Dodds, 1997, ‚ÄòThe UN Commission on Sustainable Development‚Äô =National Governance= Actions taken at mega conferences indirectly build new institutional domestic capacity by creating domestic political opportunity structures. Policy makers are, for a short while, outside the normal constraints of short term political thinking and can consider other long term environmental issues. Type II partnerships formed at WSSD also put more emphasis on environmental action at the national and sub- national level. Along with the creation of new institutional processes, they offer a move away from global level governance and encourage states to provide a more comprehensive account of their own national sustainable development strategies. For example, following the Stockholm conference (UNCHE) European leaders met in Paris at an environmental conference and regional inter- governmental meetings were also convened. Environmental mega conferences do not specifically generate national level governance but this was encouraged through the emphasis on the ‚Äòcommonality of national purpose‚Äô.Seyfang, G., and Jordan, A., 2002, ‚ÄòThe Johannesburg Summit and Sustainable Development: How Effective Are Environmental Conferences?‚Äô, in Olav Schram Stokke and √òystein B. Thommessen (eds.), Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2002/2003 (London: Earthscan Publications), 19‚Äì39.pp.20 It has been claimed that national environment ministries have gained the most from mega conferences of this nature. Legitimizing Global Governance through Inclusivity As discussed above, environmental mega conferences have a wide range of participants. Through this participation comes legitimacy as more people are involved with the decision making process and so buy into any decisions made. There are still criticisms that they fail to capture grassroots debate about sustainable development and that only the well resourced, large interest groups are able to attain a seat at the table with smaller groups remaining outside the formal decision-making process. Despite this the increased numbers of participants throughout the evolution of environmental mega conferences are encouraging. NGO involvement has grown from 134 in Stockholm (a tenth of which were from developing countries) to over 1400 in Rio (a third of which originated in developing countries).Haas, P., Levy, M., and Parson. T., 1992. Appraising the Earth Summit: How should we judge UNCED's success? Environment 34 (8) pp.6-11, 26-33. Informal, ‚Äòfringe‚Äô discussions, external to the main event, also take place, with 17,000 attendees in Rio. They firstly help NGOs to appreciate their different perspectives and agendas and to confront the difficulties of collaboration across lines of language, culture, and wealth; and secondly, provide an international platform and stature for many organizations that are ignored, starved of resources, or actively oppressed in their countries. Finally, the internet is the new method for the expansion of public and stakeholder participation. In the buildup to Johannesburg, individuals could participate via websites such as the UK government‚Äôs Sustainable Development website. Rio+20 (to be held in 2012) has websites to which major groups and stakeholders can contribute and use to get involved in the preparatory process as well as links with Facebook and Twitter. In the UK, ‚Äòe-petitions‚Äô were launched in August 2011 which enable the public to create and sign online petitions on topics to be discussed in the House of Commons. This online community may well be used further in future to increase participation and therefore legitimacy. Uncertain Future The process of governing the global environment and its sustainability issues at a cooperative global level is arguably a romantic notion. It has been said that nations, policy makers and stakeholders are operating within a restrictive framework with incoherent internal policies.Lightfoot, S., and Burchell, J., 2004. \\"Green hope or greenwash? The actions of the European Union at the World Summit on sustainable development\\". Global Environmental Change Part A. (14) pp. 337-344 Further critics state that summits such as these painfully highlight inactivity and/or the inability to fundamentally change lives of the poor or act decisively on climate change. It may be that environmental mega conferences have served their purpose in boosting environmental issues onto the global agenda and now voluntary, bi-laterally agreed partnerships and domestic policies can take the reins, rendering high level multilateral summits obsolete. On the other hand, advocates conclude that they still serve an important function in contemporary governance, even though they are not the panaceas that some had originally hoped they might be. Furthermore, if determined activists organise their campaign and demand to be heard, it is possible that this sort of pressure has the potential to keep the cycle of environmental mega conferences alive.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History In the 1910s and 1920s, Detroit saw a substantial influx of African Americans moving from the southern states in hopes of finding employment. The growth of the African American community was so great that the Black Bottom district on the east side was no longer adequate. With the population pressure, Blacks began moving in substantial numbers to other parts of the city, including the area along Tireman Avenue. This neighborhood became a Black enclave through the middle of the century, with numerous single- and multi-family houses and vibrant commercial districts along Tireman and Grand River Avenue. Side view of Nacirema Club, showing 1949 addition on left As the neighborhood grew, so did its social network. In 1922, Raymond H. Menard and Julian Archer founded the Nacirema Club as a place for well-to-do Black men to relax and network. The club was patterned after established White clubs in the city such as the Detroit Athletic Club and the Detroit Club. The name of the club is \\"American\\" spelled backwards, and is meant as a reminder that African Americans, even in this time of racial prejudice, are proud to be Americans. The club was officially incorporated in 1932, with 21 charter members, including doctors, lawyers, teachers, postal workers, and factory workers. Edgar Houston served as the first president. In 1923 the club purchased a two-story brick house which had been built three years earlier and converted it into their clubhouse. Further alterations were made in 1937 and 1942, and in 1949 a one- story addition was constructed to the rear. The club had a ballroom, dining room, and a spacious lobby, and was used by the community for wedding receptions, proms, anniversary parties, and other social events. During its heyday, the highlight of the season was the club's \\"Nacirema Week\\", where the club hosted a racetrack party, boat ride, picnic, and dinner dance. The club continued to be a men-only club until 1998, when women were first admitted as members. Although the surrounding neighborhood has fallen on hard times and club membership has dwindled, the Nacirema Club still exists. Description The building housing the Nacirema Club is a two-story, four-square vernacular American Foursquare style house covered with reddish-brown brick. It has a shallow overhanging hipped roof with projecting dormers on each side. On the front fa√ßade, a similar hipped roof covers the front porch and entryway. First-floor windows in the front have been altered, with one window bricked in and a double window replaced with a picture window. Second-floor windows are double-hung windows with paned uppers. The building is the most substantial structure on the block, and the only one with brick facing. Surrounding structures are smaller frame single-family homes, and what are now empty lots. The 1949 addition extends to the rear alley and completely covers what was once the back yard. The addition is concrete and brick.

IF-3 is thought to function as a fidelity factor during the assembly of the ternary initiation complex which consists of the 30S ribosomal subunit, the initiator tRNA and the messenger RNA. IF-3 is a basic protein that binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit. The chloroplast homolog enhances the poly(A,U,G)-dependent binding of the initiator tRNA to its ribosomal 30s subunits. IF1‚ÄìIF3 may also perform ribosome recycling. IF3 is not universally found in all bacterial species. However, in E. coli, it is required for the 30S subunit to bind to the initiation site in mRNA. In addition, it has several other jobs including the stabilization of free 30S subunits, enables 30S subunits to bind to mRNA and checks for accuracy against the first aminoacyl-tRNA. It also allows for rapid codon-anticodon pairing for the initiator tRNA to bind quickly. IF3 is required by the small subunit to form initiation complexes, but has to be released to allow the 50S subunit to bind. IF3 is made up of two domains connected by a flexible linker. Together they allow IF3 to carry out its function. Human mitochondria use a nuclear-encoded homolog MTIF3 for translation initiation. Some bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria have multiple copies of IF3.

The most important river in the region is the Warnow. Its transport links radiate from Rostock in a star configuration and the metropolitan region of the port city is served by a public transport network that includes the Rostock S-Bahn. Other important centres are the county towns of Bad Doberan and G√ºstrow. The main tourist attraction is the Baltic Sea coast along the Bay of Mecklenburg with the Salzhaff, the sea cliffs and the seaside resorts of Rerik, K√ºhlungsborn, Heiligendamm, Warnem√ºnde and Graal- M√ºritz. In the south Middle Mecklenburg transitions into the naturally very unspoilt region of the Mecklenburg Lake District. In the east the River Recknitz forms its boundary with West Pomerania, in the west it merges gradually into West Mecklenburg.  District reorganisation  Based on the decision by the state parliament (the Landtag) on 5 April 2006, a new major district called Mittleres Mecklenburg-Rostock (Middle Mecklenburg-Rostock) was to be created on 1 October 2009 with Rostock as the county seat. This district was to incorporate the former districts of Bad Doberan and G√ºstrow, as well as the hitherto independent city of Rostock. However, a judgement by the state constitutional court on 26 July 2007 the reform act could not be carried out in the way planned as it was incompatible with the state constitution.Judgement by the State Constitutional Court dated 26 July 2007 Instead the 2011 district reform in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern saw the districts of Bad Doberan and G√ºstrow combined into the new district or county of Rostock with its county headquarters in G√ºstrow.

Sandiko played important roles in Philippine history when he held various posts in the Aguinaldo cabinet. After the revolution, he went through different positions in local government of Bulacan until he was elected to Philippine Senate in 1919. Sandiko was born in Pandacan, Manila on March 31, 1860 to Miguel Sandiko and Mar√≠a Paz de Santa Ana and was educated and finished Bachelor of Arts at the University of Santo Tomas. He also took two years of law but unfortunately he didn't finish it, instead, he opened a Latin grammar school in Malolos. His radical nationalist ideas irritated the colonial Spanish officials so he sailed to Hong Kong and then to mainland Spain where he continued his law school at the University of Madrid. He was not able to finish his course because he joined the Propaganda Movement in Spain. He managed La Solidaridad on February 15, 1889. When the truce of Biak-na-Bato failed, he joined the return to the Philippines with exiles in Hong Kong. In the Philippines, he held several positions in the revolutionary republic's Aguinaldo cabinet: Minister of Foreign Affairs, Colonel of the General State, and a brigadier- general of the army. When the Americans obtained Philippines after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Sandiko became an employee of the Office of the Provost Marshal General. While being employed to the Americans, he cabled secret and valuable information to Aguinaldo government. Sandiko was the alleged author of \\"Sandiko order\\", an infamous military instruction in 1899 by him as a general of the Aguinaldo, instructing Filipino soldiers inside American- occupied Manila to rise an insurrection against to United States rule and kill all whites in the city. The \\"Sandiko order\\" was actually an American propaganda to search for Filipino savagery against American sovereignty over the islands and as a casus belli to declare war against insurrection. In 1900 US elections, Theodore Roosevelt used this document to his vice presidential candidacy as further justification to American occupation of the Philippines.Kramer, Paul A.

The Encyclopedia of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History, Volume 1 page 33 Before the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War erupted in June 1899, he resigned from office and became Aguinaldo's Minister of the Interior. After the assimilation of Philippine islands, he entered politics and was elected as the governor of Bulacan in 1906. He remained in office until 1909. In 1914 Nacionalista Party's left wing under the leadership of Sandiko bolted out of the party and established Partido Democrata Nacional or the Democratas. In 1920, he became spokesperson of Kapatiran Magsasaka.Connolly, Michael J., Church Lands and Peasant Unrest in the Philippines: Agrarian Conflict in 20th-Century Luzon page 95. From 1919‚Äì1931, he served as Senator to the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Philippine Legislatures representing the third senatorial district (present- day Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac). In 1934, he was elected as the Second Vice President of the House of Representatives of the Philippines and was a delegate to the 1934‚Äì1935 Constitutional Convention for the drafting of the 1935 Constitution. After retiring from public service, he became the manager of Katubusan and La Paz y Buen Viaje cigar factories. Sandiko died of a heart attack on October 19, 1939.

It was designed by Jan Kotƒõra, a prominent Czech architect of the early 20th century. The East Bohemian Museum was built during the years 1909-1912. Kotƒõra's initial design, presented in 1907, was criticized for its exaggerated decoration and luxurious design. Moreover, the city did not have sufficient funds for such a grandiose design. Consequently, Kotƒõra created a new design that was finished in 1908. Architecture The museum is modeled on a classic temple. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The groundplan [is] in the form of a Latin cross, [with a] polygonal nave, a dome above the intersection, [and] a monumental side entrance‚Ä¶‚Äù As far as the decoration is concerned, the entrance is decorated by two sculptures next to the entrance door. These female figures are said to be an allegory of History and Industry. These two are accompanied by a third figure made from bronze. This one is supposed to be a young Franti≈°ek Ulrich who became a mayor of Hradec Kr√°lov√© at the age of 36. Although he was young, people hoped that he would lead the city to progress. Kotƒõra also designed the interior of the museum as well. Visitors can see furniture in the director‚Äôs office, a library, seats made by Thonet Company and wood linings in the lecture hall, lighting and a fountain in front of the main entrance to the museum. The museum interiors are designed in the functionalist style. The building of the East Bohemia Museum was awaited with mixed feeling of the whole public. Kotƒõra was known as a young and progressive architect and he confirmed this statement in his works. The asymmetrical design of the building was rejected by Kotƒõra's teacher, Otto Wagner, but Kotƒõra prevailed. In 1995 the building was declared as a national cultural monument and was extensively reconstructed in 1999-2002.Historie stavby (The History of the Building) (2011) References External links * Museum of Eastern Bohemia in Hradec Kr√°lov√© at Google Cultural Institute Category:Museums in the Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region Category:History museums in the Czech Republic Category:National Cultural Monuments of the Czech Republic Category:Art Nouveau architecture in the Czech Republic Category:Art Nouveau museum buildings Category:Buildings and structures in Hradec Kr√°lov√© Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Austria-Hungary ","title":"East Bohemian Museum"},{"id":"34056103","title":"Co-Sign (song)"},{"id":"34056110","text":"Henry Treffry Dunn (1838‚Äì1899) was Dante Gabriel Rossetti's assistant and a painter in his own right.Henry Dunn, Rossetti Archive, accessed December 2011 Dunn's memoirs are a valuable source for the lives of the Pre-Raphaelites. He was paid to be Rossetti's factotum and to create copies of Rossetti's paintings. It has been said that the painting Lady Lilith in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was actually painted by Dunn and only \\"touched up\\" by Rossetti. Dunn left Rossetti's house because he was owed his salary. After Rossetti died, Dunn received the money that was owing to him and he would die whilst living with the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Theodore Watts-Dunton. Life and career Rossetti and Theodore Watts-Dunton at 16 Cheyne Walk by Henry Treffry Dunn Dunn was the son of a tea merchant. He was born in 1838 in Truro and trained at Heatherleys School of Fine Art in Chelsea. His sister Edith (born 1843) exhibited paintings, and another of his sisters was a professor of music. He took up the position of assistant to Rossetti at Cheyne Walk in 1867 when Rossetti's assistant, Walter Knewstubb, left to launch his own career. Dunn had been recommended for the position by the American artist Walter Deverell. The painter's brother William Rossetti described Dunn as having bright dark eyes and being prematurely grey. Dunn's paintings are influenced by Rossetti and in some cases he would make preliminary studies and copies for Rossetti. His painting style was described as \\"more solid than graceful\\". Dunn recounted that he was given the position after successfully creating a copy of Rossetti's work. Rossetti used his assistant frequently to create copies which he would complete and at one stage Dunn complains at having to create a third copy of the same painting. Some have said that some of Rossetti's paintings were in fact almost entirely created by Dunn. Charles Fairfax Murray, who was later another of Rossetti's assistants, claimed that the Lady Lilith in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was painted by Dunn and then \\"touched up\\" by Rossetti. 265x265px The version of Lady Lilith in the 260x260px Dunn's paintings include a version of Lady Lilith which is attributed to him. Dunn is thought to have later recreated this picture in coloured chalk based on Rossetti's version. Alexa or Alice Wilding was admired by Dunn although it not known if his feelings were returned. Dunn is reported to have only had a few women in his life and no long term attachments. Dunn was not only an artist's assistant, but also a secretary and friend. It was Dunn who first arranged for Rossetti to get a bank account, as Rossetti would keep his money in a drawer where he, and others, could freely help themselves. Dunn worked as Rossetti's assistant for many years, but they quarreled and Rossetti refused to pay him. The quarrel continued until Dunn returned to his native Cornwall in 1880, leaving Rossetti's household in chaos. Rossetti then replaced Dunn with another companion; the author Hall Caine. The lost salary remained in dispute until after Rossetti's death. When Rossetti died Dunn was very helpful to William Rossetti in his role as executor, though he considered Dunn to be an alcoholic. Dunn eventually obtained the considerable sum of money that was owed to him from Rossetti's estate. At the end of his life he was taken in by the critic and poet Theodore Watts-Dunton who had earlier saved Swinburne from alcoholism. The three of them lived together at Watts- Dunton's house until Dunn died in 1899. Dunn's recollections of Rossetti and his friends were later published. Legacy Dunn's watercolours and his other paintings are in collections in Cornwall and other British galleries.

Biography Pietro was born in Bologna to Petronio, a quadraturista, and Orsola Benedelli. Petronio moved the family to Venice in 1774, and his son worked with the father and a painter from Brescia called Lodovico Gallina. On returning to Bologna, he trained at the Accademia Clementina, winning the Marsigli Aldrovandi prize in 1784. In 1785, his Death of Virginia won a further award. He became faculty at the Clementine Academy of Fine Arts in 1791, and assumed the vice presidency with Antonio Beccadelli in 1793‚Äì94. He played a role in trying to prevent Napoleonic forces from looting the artworks from suppressed monasteries and churches. After the Accademia Clementina was converted into the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1804, Fancelli joined but without a regular teaching appointment. In Bologna and in surrounding towns, he continued to paint altarpieces, portraits and scenic design for the theater. Over the years he collaborated in the decoration of palaces with a number of local artists including Vincenzo Martinelli, Gaetano Caponeri, Bartolomeo Valiani, and Onofrio Zanotti. Among the Bolognese palaces he painted, they include the Palazzo Gnudi Scagliarini, Palazzo Grabinski, Palazzo Aldini Sanguinetti, Palazzo Tanari, Palazzo Hercolani, and the Palazzo Arcivescovile. He also painted in surrounding villas, such as Villa Pallavicini Malpighi, Villa Sorra, Villa Contri, and Villa Benelli Valmy). He worked often with Martinelli, a follower of the Bolognese tradition of landscape, making many of the figures in his paintings in tempera. He made curtains painted with mythological or historical themes, according to the taste of the time, for various theaters of Bologna (Communale, Contavalli, and Teatro del Corso) and that of Ascoli Piceno. At the Certosa di Bologna, in collaboration with other artists, he painted several tombs (Tartagni Marvelli, Magnani, Bargellini, Gnugni, Borghi, Cospi, Conti Castello, Malvezzi) among which that of Martinelli, his friend and workmate, set in a landscape that evokes those painted by the artist in life. He moved to Pesaro in the last years of his life, and died there in 1850. Among his works are a painting of the Stigmata of St Francis (1796) for the church of St Francis of Faenza; a painting of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Filippo Benizzi (1798) for San Giovanni in Persiceto; a Christ and the Maries and Crucifixion (1802) for the cycle of Mysteries of the Rosary in San Stefano in Bazzano. He painted a Charity of St Thomas of Villanova for San Giacomo Maggiore in Bologna; and a St Anne and the Virgin (1829) for Santa Maria Maggiore in Bologna. By 1797, he had completed the mythologic scenes for the Villa Muratori-Guerrini-Meriggiano, in collaboration with the landscape artists Vincenzo Martinelli. This collaboration was continued in the Palazzo Hercolani (1802) and the Villa Pallavacini, later Coccapani Tacoli. They also collaborated in canvases found in the Weiss Collection in Bologna, also in tombs of the Certosa of Bologna. He also was commissioned to decorate the scene of Felsina (Bologna) offering the keys of the city to Napoleon, part of transient decoration of triumphal arches celebrating the entrance of Napoleon Bonaparte to the City in 1805. Similar skills were used in works of scenic design for theatrical representations of Alessandro conquistatore della Persia (1820; Orloff, 1823; Giordani, 1855), and at the former Teatro Contavalli, the curtain depicting Marriage of Zeus and Hera; and theater of Corso, the Triumph of Sophocles.

He was the ruling Count of Oldenburg from 1500 to 1526. His parents were Gerhard VI, Count of Oldenburg and Adelheid of Tecklenburg. Life After his father resigned, John V prevailed against his brothers and became Count of Oldenburg. In his effort to become the ruling count John V invaded the Weser and North Sea marshes of Stadland and Butjadingen with mercenaries in April 1499, to both of which the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen claimed its overlordship, in order to subject their free peasants.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 266\\\\. . John had hired parts of the Black Guard, a free- lance troop of mercenaries, commanded by Ulrich von Dornum, who defeated the free peasants in two battles.Tileman Dothias Wiarda, Ostfriesische Geschichte: 10 vols., here vol. 2: 'Zweiter Band von 1441 bis 1540', Aurich: August Friedrich Winter, 1792, p. 184. Already in November Magnus of Saxe-Lauenburg, then regent in the Land of Hadeln, hired the Black Guard, too expensive for John, in order to conquer the Land of Wursten. This was the start of a series of campaigns to subject the free peasants in the North Sea and river marshes to feudalism, to wit Altes Land, Ditmarsh, Land of Hadeln, Haseldorfer Marsch, Kehdingen, and Wilstermarsch, also known as the Elbe Marshes, Butjadingen and Stadland (today's Weser Marsh), as well as Stedingen, the Land of W√ºrden, and the Land of Wursten.Karl Ernst Hermann Krause, \\"Johann III., Erzbischof von Bremen\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. 14, pp. 183‚Äì185, here p. 184. Bremen's prince-archbishop Johann Rode then tried to form a war alliance to repel John's and prevent further invasions, feared for the Land of Wursten, first gaining the cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Stade, which considered the areas downstream the rivers Elbe and Weser their own front yard existential for their free maritime trade connections. The free peasants in Stadland and Butjadingen liberated themselves from the Oldenburgian yoke in April 1500, supported by East Frisia. John V could keep his external opponent, Edzard I, Count of East Frisia in check through alliances. During the Saxon feud, he and the united Dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg attacked Edzard in January 1514. He was then able to conquer Butjadingen and Stadland and parts of the Frisian Wehde. He tried to keep the Stadland area with Esenshamm and Abbehausen as allodial property. However, in 1517, he had to accept them as fiefs from Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Initially, the dukes of Brunswick occupied Butjadingen. However, after a failed peasants uprising in 1515, they gradually transferred ownership to John V, and by 1523, Butjadingen was definitely owned by Oldenburg. John V died in 1526. After his death, his sons John VI, Christopher, George, and Anthony I ruled jointly. Issue He married Anna of Anhalt-Zerbst, daughter of George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau.

The farthest back and largest piece when looking from front is painted black. The middle piece is painted red and the last is painted white. Historical information Space Game was made originally for an indoor three piece set. Later on Mendla ended up giving it to the Peck family. The Peck family owned a Slaughterhouse business called Peck Meat Packing Corporation. When the sculpture was received they added recessed lights and a concrete base. The pieces were then put all together to form one big abstract piece. The Peck family ended up selling their business in the late 1980s but the sculpture is still located on site. Artist Artist Joseph Mendla has a B.F.A. at the Philadelphia College of Art, also from University of Pennsylvania he received a M.F.A. in sculpture. Mendla also was the founder of the sculpture department at the Louisville School of Art. He also completed the foundry at Layton School of Art shortly after his arrival in there in 1971 . Most of Mendla's own original design was brought into the equipment at Hartbronze. Hartbronze Inc was founded by Joseph Mendla and Hilary Goldblatt. Heartbronze was at the time the only commercial foundry dedicated to solely cast-metal sculptures. The foundry was located in the Peck Meat Packing building where Space game is located.

Members of this family include: *The human interferon gamma receptor 1, which is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily. It is expressed in a membrane-bound form in many cell types, and is over-expressed in tumour cells. It comprises an extracellular portion of 229 amino acid residues, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain of 221 amino acid residues. As with other members of its superfamily, the cytokine-binding sites are formed by a small set of closely spaced surface loops that extend from a beta-sheet core, much like antigen-binding sites on antibodies. *The vaccinia virus interferon (IFN)-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR), which is a 43 kDa soluble glycoprotein that is secreted from infected cells early during infection. IFN-gammaR from vaccinia virus, cowpox virus and camelpox virus exist naturally as homodimers, whereas the cellular IFN-gammaR dimerises only upon binding the homodimeric IFN-gamma.

It has nine subsidiaries across Europe, Asia and the USA und 40 agencies worldwide. The independent family enterprise designs, manufactures and distributes textiles worldwide for interior furnishing, for both the contract sector and residential furnishing. Its hallmark is contemporary fabrics for curtains, upholstery and wall coverings as well as systems and adhesive textiles. Cr√©ation Baumann employs 260 members of staff.  Company history  In 1886 Friedrich Baumann and Albert Brand founded the company ¬´Brand & Baumann¬ª for the manufacture and distribution of linen goods. The two entrepreneurs went their separate ways at the start of the 20th century. Friedrich Baumann set up his own business called ¬´Baumann-Gr√ºtter¬ª, which was taken on by his sons Willy and Fritz in 1930. Willy was responsible for the finances, whilst Fritz looked after manufacture and distribution. Step by step they built up exports. After the Second World War, the enterprise was split into two; an upholstery fabric manufacturing plant and a linen weaving mill. Fritz Baumann took charge of the linen weaving mill, which later developed into the trademark ¬´Cr√©ation Baumann¬ª. In 1951 the enterprise, which meanwhile was also producing curtain fabrics, relocated to new buildings at the Bern- Z√ºrich-Strasse in Langenthal, at which Cr√©ation Baumann's headquarters are still today. The company achieved continuous growth and exports flourished. In 1976 the third generation took charge of the company with Joerg Baumann. Cr√©ation Baumann already numbered 200 employees. The trademark was promoted worldwide and in 1985 turnover reached the 40 million Swiss franc mark for the first time. Since 2000, the management has been under the stewardship of Philippe Baumann, the fourth generation Baumann entrusted with the management of the company. In the last few years export accounted for between 73 and 75 percent of sales.  Field of activity  Cr√©ation Baumann unites design, production and distribution in Langenthal. The textile range consists of three sectors: textiles with the Cr√©ation Baumann Line and the Living Line, Systems which includes panel curtains, vertical blinds and Roman blinds and adhesive textiles. It includes textiles with inherent special functions, such as the control of incoming light and sound absorption.  Textile Innovations  In 2006 Cr√©ation Baumann launched GECKO, a new development. GECKO is a self adhering, UV resistant textile, which, owing to a silicon coating, can be affixed to window glass through the use of adhesive power, from which it can be removed without a trace of residue and without loss of adhesion. The adhesive textile can be used anywhere where privacy, glare protection and temperature control are required and where architectural or style considerations preclude curtaining, blinds or panels. The Silver&Steel; collection, which was introduced in 2009, was also a textile technical innovation. A thin aluminium or steel layer, which is applied to the reverse of the fabric using ultra modern technical engineering, reduces the ingress of sun rays and incoming light through effective reflection to create a soft light without glare, whilst simultaneously minimising the ingress of heat. The coating achieves function values which are impossible to attain with conventional textiles. If special properties are in demand for delicate and exacting applications such as in office buildings, museums or the health care sector Cr√©ation Baumann has a palette of innovative and functional textiles. The spectrum includes blackout fabrics, textiles for privacy and glare protection, flame retardant fabrics, fabrics which have been tested for harmful substances and textiles that offer acoustic solutions to direct and control sound.  Sustainability  Environmental protection has long been a tradition at Cr√©ation Baumann. As early as 1973 the enterprise was spearheading the Swiss textile industry with an expansion of its dye workshop that included a neutralisation plant. To this day, Cr√©ation Baumann can achieve the prescribed norms for the processing of industrial effluents with the neutralisation plant without having to resort to any further chemical processes.  Designers' Saturday  Cr√©ation Baumann is initiator and founder of the Swiss design event Designers' Saturday,Designers' Saturday which has been held in Langenthal biannually since 1987. In 2010, the Designers' Saturday attracted almost 18'000 visitors to Langenthal.  Literature / Sources  * Baumann, J√∂rg: In the weave - The World of Decorative Fabrics, Stories and Histories.

Originally proposed by the Thailand-based property developer Reignwood Group, and designed to be the largest amusement park in Asia (to have covered ), construction stopped in 1998 following financial problems with local officials, while a 2008 attempt to start construction again also failed. The site featured a number of abandoned structures, including the framework of a castle-like building and medieval-themed outer buildings. Land was reclaimed by local farmers to grow their various crops while the site was abandoned. People have reported when visiting the site that, sometimes, there would still be parking attendants in the site's parking lot, presumably to tend to onlookers and curious sightseers that came to visit. The abandonment of such a massive construction project raised concerns about the existence of a \\"property bubble\\" in China. The incomplete and abandoned structures were demolished in May 2013, leaving no hope for the abandoned park to ever be finished. While there was no official indication of what would be done with the grounds of where the park once stood, An Feng, Reignwood Group's chief inspector for the company's investment supervision department, stated a \\"comprehensive luxury product supermarket\\" would be built on the site, but at that time the project was still going through \\"planning permission formalities\\". Construction on a shopping mall, the Badaling Outlets (), was later completed in 2015 and opened to the public on 26 June of that year.

Background Since the initial 1787‚Äì88 debate over ratification of the Constitution, there have been sporadic calls for the convening of a second convention to modify and correct perceived shortcomings in the Federal system it established. Article V of the Constitution provides two methods for amending the nation's frame of government. The first method authorizes Congress, \\"whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary\\" (a two-thirds majority of those members present‚Äîassuming that a quorum exists at the time that the vote is cast‚Äîand not necessarily a two-thirds majority vote of the entire membership elected and serving in the two houses of Congress), to propose Constitutional amendments. The second method requires Congress, \\"on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states\\" (presently 34), to \\"call a convention for proposing amendments\\". In 1943, Alexander Hehmeyer, a lawyer for Chicago-based Marshall Field's department store as well as Time Inc., wrote A Time for Change (Farrar & Rinehart), in which he proposed a second Constitutional Convention to streamline the Federal Government. In the late 1960s, Senator Everett Dirksen called for a constitutional convention by appealing to state legislatures to summon one. Three times in the 20th century, concerted efforts were undertaken by proponents of particular issues to secure the number of applications necessary to summon an Article V Convention. These included conventions to consider amendments to (1) provide for popular election of U.S. Senators; (2) permit the states to include factors other than equality of population in drawing state legislative district boundaries; and (3) to propose an amendment requiring the U.S. budget to be balanced under most circumstances. The campaign for a popularly elected Senate is frequently credited with \\"prodding\\" the Senate to join the House of Representatives in proposing what became the Seventeenth Amendment to the states in 1912,Lessig (2011, pp. 292‚Äì3). while the latter two campaigns came very close to meeting the two-thirds threshold in the 1960s and 1980s, respectively. In 2013, the number of states calling for a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment was believed to be either 33 or 20,Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group, November 25, 2013, House and Senate leaders to tout need for balanced budget amendment to U.S. Constitution, Accessed Dec. 29, 2013 and the tally may depend on rulings about whether past state applications have been rescinded. In 1983, Missouri applied;Terry Ganey, January 23, 2010, Columbia Daily Tribune, Legislators push balanced budget: U.S. deficits spur amendment call, Accessed Dec. 29, 2013, \\"...Legislatures have petitioned Congress to adopt an amendment in the past.

In it, Pettis proposed that each state would be entitled to send as many delegates to the convention as it had Senators and Representatives in Congress and that such delegates would be selected in the manner designated by the legislature of each state. Being a concurrent rather than a joint resolution, the legislation would not have‚Äîhad it been adopted by both the House and Senate‚Äîtriggered a national Article V convention. Rather, it would have conveyed the sentiments of Congress that one be called. On August 5, 1977, Representative Norman F. Lent, Republican from New York, introduced a similar concurrent resolution (95th H.Con.Res.340). Both were referred to the House Judiciary Committee. No further action on either was taken. A report in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2011 described the movement for a convention as gaining \\"traction\\" in public debate, and wrote that \\"concern over a seemingly dysfunctional climate in Washington and issues ranging from the national debt to the overwhelming influence of money in politics have spawned calls for fundamental change in the document that guides the nation's government.\\" For several years, state lawmakers approved no Article V Convention calls at all, and even went so far as to adopt resolutions rescinding their prior such calls. However, in 2011, legislators in Alabama, Louisiana, and North Dakota (in two instances) approved resolutions applying for an Article V Convention. All three of these states had adopted rescissions in 1988, 1990, and 2001, respectively, but then reversed course in 2011. The same was true in 2012 with New Hampshire lawmakers who had adopted a resolution to rescind previous convention applications as recently as 2010. Columnist William Safire A report by analyst David Gergen on CNN suggested that despite serious differences between left- leaning Occupy movements and the right-leaning Tea Party movements, there was considerable agreement on both sides that money plays \\"far too large a role in politics.\\" Scholars such as Richard Labunski, Sanford Levinson, Lawrence Lessig, Glenn Reynolds, Larry Sabato, newspaper columnist William Safire, and activists such as John Booth of the Dallas movement RestoringFreedom.org have called for constitutional changes that would curb the dominant role of money in politics. Scholar Stein Ringen in his book Nation of Devils suggested that only a \\"total overhaul\\" of the constitution could fix the \\"years of accumulated damage and dysfunction,\\" according to a report in the Economist in 2013.Staff writer, reviewing Nation of Devils: Democratic Leadership and the Problem of Obedience by Stein Ringen, The Economist, Oct. 5, 2013, The maturing of democracy ‚Äì Picking up the tab ‚Äì Democracy has survived many crises.

A report on CNN suggested that 30 state legislatures are considering resolutions either calling for a constitutional convention or else proposing changes to the Constitution. David O. Stewart suggested that possible topics for Constitutional amendments might include the elimination of the electoral college and switching to direct election of the president, a ban on procedures in the United States Senate which utilize a supermajority vote requirement as a means to prevent minorities or powerful Senators from blocking legislation, term limits for Senators and Representatives, and a balanced budget amendment. Questions Numerous questions surround the issue of how such an unprecedented convention might be conducted. There is no consensus on how such a convention may be organized, led, or who may be selected to be in such a body. Precedent While there is no precedent for such a convention, scholars have noted that the original 1787 Convention, itself, was the first precedent, as it had only been authorized to amend the Articles of Confederation, not to draw up an entirely new frame of government. According to The New York Times, the action by the Founding Fathers set up a precedent that could be used today. But, since 1787, there has not been an overall constitutional convention. Instead, each time the amendment process has been initiated since 1789, it has been initiated by Congress. All 33 amendments submitted to the states for ratification originated there. The convention option, which Alexander Hamilton (writing in The Federalist No. 85) believed would serve as a barrier \\"against the encroachments of the national authority\\",Sen. David Long \\"Amending the U.S. Constitution by State-Led Convention\\" has yet to be successfully invoked, although not for lack of activity in the states. Scope of a possible convention There have been calls for a second convention based on a single issue such as the Balanced Budget Amendment. According to one count, 17 of 34 states have petitioned Congress for a \\"convention to propose a balanced budget amendment.\\" But Congress has been reluctant to \\"impose limitations on its spending and borrowing and taxing powers\\", according to anti-tax activist David Biddulph. Law professor Michael Stokes Paulsen suggested that such a convention would have the \\"power to propose anything it sees fit\\" and that calls for a convention to focus on only one issue \\"may not be valid\\", according to this view. According to Paulsen's count, 33 states have called for a general convention, although some of these calls have been pending \\"since the 19th century.\\" According to a New York Times report, different groups would be nervous that a convention summoned to address only one issue might propose a wholesale revision of the entire Constitution, possibly limiting \\"provisions they hold dear.\\" Such groups include the American Civil Liberties Union, the John Birch Society, the National Organization for Women, the Gun Owners Clubs of America and conservative advocate Phyllis Schlafly. Accordingly, they are opposed to the idea of a second convention. Lawrence Lessig countered that the requirement of having 38 states ratify any proposed revision‚Äîthree-quarters of all state legislatures‚Äîmeant that any extreme proposals would be blocked, since either 13 red or 13 blue states could block such a measure. Language Constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe noted that the language in the current Constitution about how to implement a second one is \\"dangerously vague\\", and that there is a possibility that the same interests that have corrupted Washington's politics may have a hand in efforts to rewrite it. Politicians and scholars who are reluctant to have a second constitutional convention may insist that all 34 state petitions to Congress must have an identical wording or otherwise the petitions would be considered invalid. It shall also be necessary for one state to initially create a resolution and subsequently pass; and then this same resolution, which passes, must circulate among the several states and be approved by the necessary two thirds before a convention would be held. In other words, one document would be drawn up and passed by the states that would state the rules governing such a convention. The Founding Fathers allowed for such flexibility within the U.S. Constitution. Particular views Lawrence Lessig Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has argued that a movement to urge state legislatures to call for a constitutional Convention was the best possibility to achieve substantive reform: Lessig argued that the ordinary means of politics were not feasible to solve the problem affecting the United States government because the incentives corrupting politicians are so powerful. Lessig believes a convention is needed in view of Supreme Court decisions to eliminate most limits on campaign contributions. He quoted congressperson Jim Cooper from Tennessee who remarked that Congress had become a \\"Farm League for K Street\\" in the sense that congresspersons were focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving in the Congress, and not on serving the public interest. He proposed that such a convention be populated by a random drawing of citizens' names as a way to keep special interests out of the process. Sanford Levinson Constitutional scholar and University of Texas Law School professor Sanford Levinson wrote Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the Constitution Goes Wrong and called for a \\"wholesale revision of our nation's founding document.\\" Levinson wrote: Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, in a keynote speech at Harvard Law School, said the movement for a new convention was a reflection of having in many ways \\"the worst political class in our country's history.\\" Political scientist Larry Sabato believes a second convention is necessary since \\"piecemeal amendments\\" have not been working. Sabato argued that America needs a \\"grand meeting of clever and high-minded people to draw up a new, improved constitution better suited to the 21st century.\\" Author Scott Turow sees risks with a possible convention but believes it may be the only possible way to undo how campaign money has undermined the \\"one-man one-vote\\" premise. Few new constitutions are modeled along the lines of the U.S. one, according to a study by David Law of Washington University. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg views the United States Constitution as more of a relic of the 18th century rather than as a model for new constitutions, and she suggested in 2014 that a nation seeking a new constitution might find a better model by examining the Constitution of South Africa (1997), the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) and the European Convention on Human Rights (1950):Staff reporters and Steven Sweeney, March 4, 2012, Massachusetts Daily Collegian, A Second Constitutional Convention, Accessed April 7, 2014, \\"...As Justice Ginsburg's comments suggest, the U.S. Constitution is more a relic of the 18th century than a workable plan for government in the 21st.
