It runs north from Shepherd's Bush, under the Westway (A40) past Wormwood Scrubs where it meets Scrubs Lane. The road is wholly in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (W12 postal district). It is probably best known as the former home of the BBC Television Centre, also BBC White City and formerly BBC Woodlands the offices of BBC Worldwide. Westway flyover junction at Ladbroke Grove, looking east History In the 1780s, the road was known as Turvens Lane after Turvens House located a short distance north of Shepherd's Bush Green. By the 1830s it had received its current name. In the 1860s the railway arrived with a line running parallel with Wood Lane but the area was still rural in character with the buildings of Wood Lane Farm, Eynam Farm and Hoof's Farm to the east of the road and a plant nursery to the west covering the land east of present-day Frithville Gardens and south of the BBC Television centre. Even into the 20th century the land either side of Wood Lane remained undeveloped until the area was chosen for the site of the 1908 Franco-British exhibition and 1908 Summer Olympics. The area to the west of Wood Lane, north of Loftus Road stadium, south of Du Cane Road and east of Bloemfontein Road was laid out as the exhibition site. The numerous pavilions faced with white stone earned the exhibition the nickname \\"the White City\\" which subsequently remained with the area, even after the exhibition closed and its pavilions were demolished. White City Stadium built to host the Olympics was located on the site of BBC White City. =Wood Lane Underground stations= The Central London Railway (CLR, now the Central line) opened Wood Lane station in 1908 on the north side of its Wood Lane depot to serve the exhibition. Originally intended to be a temporary service it survived until 1947 when it was replaced by White City station a short distance to the north. The Metropolitan Railway also opened a station on its line between Paddington and Hammersmith (now the Hammersmith & City line). The station, also called Wood Lane although separate from the CLR's station, was adjacent to the railway bridge over Wood Lane. This station survived until it was destroyed by fire in 1959. To serve the new White City shopping centre development, a new station on the Hammersmith & City line, also called Wood Lane opened on 12 October 2008 to the east of Wood Lane.

Through mechanotransduction, hair cells detect movement in their environment. In mammals, the auditory hair cells are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called hair bundles that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid-filled cochlear duct. Mammalian cochlear hair cells are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types, known as outer, and inner hair cells. Damage to these hair cells results in decreased hearing sensitivity, and because the inner ear hair cells cannot regenerate, this damage is permanent. However, other organisms, such as the frequently studied zebrafish, and birds have hair cells that can regenerate. The human cochlea contains on the order of 3,500 inner hair cells and 12,000 outer hair cells at birth.R√©my Pujol, R√©gis Nouvian, Marc Lenoir, \\"Hair cells (cochlea.eu) The outer hair cells mechanically amplify low-level sound that enters the cochlea. The amplification may be powered by the movement of their hair bundles, or by an electrically driven motility of their cell bodies. This so-called somatic electromotility amplifies sound in all land vertebrates. It is affected by the closing mechanism of the mechanical sensory ion channels at the tips of the hair bundles. The inner hair cells transform the sound vibrations in the fluids of the cochlea into electrical signals that are then relayed via the auditory nerve to the auditory brainstem and to the auditory cortex.  Inner hair cells ‚Äì from sound to nerve signal  Section through the organ of Corti, showing inner and outer hair cells The deflection of the hair-cell stereocilia opens mechanically gated ion channels that allow any small, positively charged ions (primarily potassium and calcium) to enter the cell. Unlike many other electrically active cells, the hair cell itself does not fire an action potential. Instead, the influx of positive ions from the endolymph in the scala media depolarizes the cell, resulting in a receptor potential. This receptor potential opens voltage gated calcium channels; calcium ions then enter the cell and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at the basal end of the cell. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the narrow space between the hair cell and a nerve terminal, where they then bind to receptors and thus trigger action potentials in the nerve. In this way, the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal. Repolarization of hair cells is done in a special manner. The perilymph in the scala tympani has a very low concentration of positive ions. The electrochemical gradient makes the positive ions flow through channels to the perilymph. Hair cells chronically leak Ca2+. This leakage causes a tonic release of neurotransmitter to the synapses. It is thought that this tonic release is what allows the hair cells to respond so quickly in response to mechanical stimuli. The quickness of the hair cell response may also be due to the fact that it can increase the amount of neurotransmitter release in response to a change as little as 100 ŒºV in membrane potential.  Outer hair cells ‚Äì acoustical pre-amplifiers  In mammalian outer hair cells, the varying receptor potential is converted to active vibrations of the cell body. This mechanical response to electrical signals is termed somatic electromotility; it drives variations in the cell's length, synchronized to the incoming sound signal, and provides mechanical amplification by feedback to the traveling wave.A movie clip showing an isolated outer hair cell moving in response to electrical stimulation can be seen here (physiol.ox.ac.uk). Outer hair cells are found only in mammals. While hearing sensitivity of mammals is similar to that of other classes of vertebrates, without functioning outer hair cells, the sensitivity decreases by approximately 50 dB . Outer hair cells extend the hearing range to about 200 kHz in some marine mammals. They have also improved frequency selectivity (frequency discrimination), which is of particular benefit for humans, because it enabled sophisticated speech and music. Outer hair cells are functional even after cellular stores of ATP are depleted. The effect of this system is to nonlinearly amplify quiet sounds more than large ones so that a wide range of sound pressures can be reduced to a much smaller range of hair displacements. This property of amplification is called the cochlear amplifier. The molecular biology of hair cells has seen considerable progress in recent years, with the identification of the motor protein (prestin) that underlies somatic electromotility in the outer hair cells. Prestin's function has been shown to be dependent on chloride channel signaling and that it is compromised by the common marine pesticide tributyltin. Because this class of pollutant bioconcentrates up the food chain, the effect is pronounced in top marine predators such as orcas and toothed whales.  Hair cell signal adaption  Calcium ion influx plays an important role for the hair cells to adapt to the amplification of the signal. This allows humans to ignore constant sounds that are no longer new and allow us to be acute to other changes in our surrounding. The key adaptation mechanism comes from a motor protein myosin-1c that allows slow adaptation, provides tension to sensitize transduction channels, and also participate in signal transduction apparatus. More recent research now shows that the calcium-sensitive binding of calmodulin to myosin-1c could actually modulate the interaction of the adaptation motor with other components of the transduction apparatus as well. Fast Adaptation: During fast adaptation, Ca2+ ions that enter a stereocilium through an open MET channel bind rapidly to a site on or near the channel and induce channel closure. When channels close, tension increases in the tip link, pulling the bundle in the opposite direction. Fast adaptation is more prominent in sound and auditory detecting hair cells, rather in vestibular cells. Slow Adaption: The dominating model suggests that slow adaptation occurs when myosin-1c slides down the stereocilium in response to elevated tension during bundle displacement. The resultant decreased tension in the tip link permits the bundle to move farther in the opposite direction. As tension decreases, channels close, producing the decline in transduction current. Slow adaptation is most prominent in vestibular hair cells that sense spatial movement and less in cochlear hair cells that detect auditory signals. Neural connection Neurons of the auditory or vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) innervate cochlear and vestibular hair cells. The neurotransmitter released by hair cells that stimulates the terminal neurites of peripheral axons of the afferent (towards the brain) neurons is thought to be glutamate. At the presynaptic juncture, there is a distinct presynaptic dense body or ribbon. This dense body is surrounded by synaptic vesicles and is thought to aid in the fast release of neurotransmitter. Nerve fiber innervation is much denser for inner hair cells than for outer hair cells. A single inner hair cell is innervated by numerous nerve fibers, whereas a single nerve fiber innervates many outer hair cells. Inner hair cell nerve fibers are also very heavily myelinated, which is in contrast to the unmyelinated outer hair cell nerve fibers. The region of the basilar membrane supplying the inputs to a particular afferent nerve fibre can be considered to be its receptive field. Efferent projections from the brain to the cochlea also play a role in the perception of sound. Efferent synapses occur on outer hair cells and on afferent axons under inner hair cells. The presynaptic terminal bouton is filled with vesicles containing acetylcholine and a neuropeptide called calcitonin gene-related peptide. The effects of these compounds vary, in some hair cells the acetylcholine hyperpolarized the cell, which reduces the sensitivity of the cochlea locally.  Regrowth  Research on the regrowth of cochlear cells may lead to medical treatments that restore hearing. Unlike birds and fish, humans and other mammals are generally incapable of regrowing the cells of the inner ear that convert sound into neural signals when those cells are damaged by age or disease. Researchers are making progress in gene therapy and stem-cell therapy that may allow the damaged cells to be regenerated. Because hair cells of auditory and vestibular systems in birds and fish have been found to regenerate, their ability has been studied at length. In addition, lateral line hair cells, which have a mechanotransduction function, have been shown to regrow in organisms, such as the zebrafish. Researchers have identified a mammalian gene that normally acts as a molecular switch to block the regrowth of cochlear hair cells in adults. The Rb1 gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein, which is a tumor suppressor. Rb stops cells from dividing by encouraging their exit from the cell cycle. Not only do hair cells in a culture dish regenerate when the Rb1 gene is deleted, but mice bred to be missing the gene grow more hair cells than control mice that have the gene. Additionally, the sonic hedgehog protein has been shown to block activity of the retinoblastoma protein, thereby inducing cell cycle re-entry and the regrowth of new cells. The cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 (CDKN1B) has also been found to encourage regrowth of cochlear hair cells in mice following genetic deletion or knock down with siRNA targeting p27. (primary source) (primary source) Research on hair cell regeneration may bring us closer to clinical treatment for human hearing loss caused by hair cell damage or death.

It is long, running from Gardiner's Corner (previously the site of Gardiners department store, and now Aldgate East Underground station), through Stepney to the junction with Burdett Road in Limehouse at which point the route splits into the East India Dock Road and the West India Dock Road. It is an artery connecting the historic City of London with the more recently developed financial district at Canary Wharf, and part of the A13. The road contains several listed buildings. These include the George Tavern, the Troxy cinema, the Limehouse Town Hall and the Albert Gardens estate. Route Commercial Road starts at a junction with Whitechapel High Street (the A11 close to Aldgate East tube station. It heads east, crossing the Limehouse Basin, the Regents Canal and the Limehouse Cut. At Burdett Road, the road forks in two, with East India Dock Road continuing to the left and West India Dock Road to the right. London Buses routes 15, 115 and 135 run along Commercial Road.https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/route/15/https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/route/115/https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/route/135/ History The George Tavern Commercial Road was constructed in 1802‚Äì6 as a direct route to link dock traffic between the West India Docks and East India Docks to the City of London. An Act of Parliament awarded construction to the Commercial Road Company, whose trustees were allowed to raise money and levy tolls. The road originally began at Back Church Lane and cut a straight line across fields north of the busy Ratcliffe Highway, taking advantage of land cleared by a major fire in 1794 that had destroyed a large part of the neighbourhood. By the 1830s it was almost entirely lined with houses all the way to Limehouse. In 1828, the Commercial Road Company built a tramway from Aberdeen granite along the road, to alleviate traffic concerns. The London and Blackwall Railway was built parallel to Commercial Road; along with the numerous factories, this caused the street to become overcrowded and polluted. In the 1860s Commercial Road became a public road, with ownership transferring to the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), and road tolls were abolished. In 1870, the MBW extended the street westwards to Gardiner's Corner, where it met Whitechapel High Street and Commercial Street. This junction remained in place until Gardner's was destroyed in a fire in the early 1970s. In 1943, Commercial Road was marked for improvement in the County of London Plan, after much of the surrounding area had been destroyed by bombing. Numerous side streets south of the road towards Ratcliffe Highway were cleared of slums and replaced with modern housing. The Commercial Road Conservation Area was established by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1989. It is focused on numerous listed buildings around Nos. 300‚Äì334 about halfway along the road. Buildings Limehouse Town Hall The George Tavern is at No. 373\\\\. It was built around 1820‚Äì25 on the site of an earlier pub, the Halfway House, which had been established since at least 1654. It became Grade II listed in 1973. Albert Gardens lies to the south of Commercial Road. It was laid out in the early 19th century, originally named Albert Square Garden, and has largely survived intact into the 21st. The square consists of three sides of three- storey residential buildings constructed in the 1840s, overlooking a railed garden. The other side faces onto Commercial Road. The land was brought by the London County Council in 1899 to prevent development on the fourth side, and opened the land to the public in 1906. It was given its current name in 1937. Nos. 440‚Äì450 are all Grade II listed. They were built in the early 19th century as a terrace, and all span four storeys with parapets roofs, round arched entrances and panelled doors. The Troxy Cinema at No. 490 was opened by George Coles and Arthur Roberts in 1933 on a former brewery site. It cost ¬£250,000 to develop and could house over 3,000 people. The main theatre housed a revolving stage Wurlitzer organ which could be raised from the orchestra pit to provide interval music; these have survived intact. It closed in 1960, reopening in 1963 as a training school for the Covent Garden Opera. It subsequently became a bingo hall. It was grade II listed in 1991. Limehouse Town Hall is at No. 646, constructed in 1879 by A. and C. Harston. It was badly damaged in World War II and rebuilt as council offices. It has subsequently served as the National Museum of Labour History, a homeless shelter, and an arts centre. The Passmore Edwards Sailors Palace at No. 680 was built in 1901 in a Neo Tudor style. It has been Grade II listed since 1983. The Star of the East The Grade II listed Caird & Rayner Warehouse at No. 777‚Äì783 was constructed in 1869. It contained a timber frame enclosed by a brick exterior. In 2010, it caught fire which destroyed most of the roof. Urgent repairs took place in 2010 in light of its listed status. The Star of the East, at No. 805 was built in the early 19th century, and Grade II listed in 1973. It was constructed from red brick with a slate roof. In 2019, urgent repairs were made to the premises in order for it to retain its listed status. The Church of St Mary and St Michael is at No. 340\\\\. It was designed by William Wardell and constructed between 1852 and 1856. A sloping roof was built over the entrance in the 1920s. It became Grade II listed in June 2001. The Congregation of Jacob Synagogue is at Nos. 351‚Äì353. It was founded in 1903 as Britain's first Mizrachi synagogues, and moved into the present building in 1920. The premises had been originally constructed by Lewis Solomon and Son. London's first mosque, the East London Mosque, opened on Commercial Road in 1941 and remained there until it was relocated to Whitechapel in 1975. A K2 phone box outside No. 48 Commercial Road was Grade II listed in 1987. It was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and installed in 1927. Traffic As the main route between the City and the traditional East End, Commercial Road is the busiest road in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. There is continuous heavy traffic along the road, with limited opportunities for pedestrians crossing.

At the turn of the 20th century, only about 1,200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. It has been reintroduced to much of its former range, and now occurs from Spain, Central Europe, Great Britain and Scandinavia to a few regions in China and Mongolia. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, as it recovered well in most of Europe. It is extinct in Portugal, Moldova, and Turkey. Taxonomy Castor fiber was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the beaver in his work Systema Naturae. Between 1792 and 1997, several Eurasian beaver zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, including: *C. f. albus and C. f. solitarius by Robert Kerr in 1792 *C. f. fulvus and C. f. variegatus by Johann Matth√§us Bechstein in 1801 *C. f. galliae by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1803 *C. f. flavus, C. f. varius and C. f. niger by Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest in 1822 *C. f. gallicus Johann Baptist Fischer in 1829 *C. f. proprius by Gustaf Johan Billberg in 1833 *C. f. albicus, C. f. balticus and C. f. vistulanus by Paul Matschie in 1907 *C. f. birulai and C. f. pohlei by Serebrennikov in 1929 *C. f. tuvinicus by Lavrov in 1969 *C. f. belarusicus and C. f. osteuropaeus by Lavrov in 1974 *C. f. belorussicus and C. f. orientoeuropaeus by Lavrov in 1981 *C. f. bielorussieus by Lavrov in 1983 *C. f. introductus by Saveljev in 1997 These descriptions were largely based on very small differences in fur colour and cranial morphology, none of which warrant a subspecific distinction. In 2005, analysis of mitochondrial DNA of Eurasian beaver samples showed that only two evolutionarily significant units exist: a western phylogroup in Western and Central Europe, and an eastern phylogroup in the region east of the Oder and Vistula rivers. The eastern phylogroup is genetically more diverse, but still at a degree below thresholds considered sufficient for subspecific differentiation. Description The Eurasian beaver's fur colour varies between regions. Light, chestnut-rust is the dominant colour in Belarus. In Russia's Sozh River basin, it is predominantly blackish brown, while in the Voronezh Reserve beavers are both brown and blackish-brown. The Eurasian beaver is one of the largest living rodent species and the largest rodent native to Eurasia. Its head-to-body length is with a long tail length. It weighs around . In Norway, adult males average , while females average . Adults from the same country average . By the average weights known, it appears to be the world's second heaviest rodent after the capybara, and is slightly larger and heavier than the North American beaver. The largest recorded specimen weighed , but it can exceptionally exceed . =Differences from North American beaver= Skulls of a European and North American beaver Although the Eurasian beaver appears superficially similar to the North American beaver, there are several important differences, chief among these being that the North American beaver has 40 chromosomes, while the Eurasian beaver has 48. The two species are not genetically compatible: After more than 27 attempts in Russia to hybridise the two species, the result was one stillborn kit that was bred from the pairing of a male North American beaver and a female Eurasian beaver. The difference in chromosome count makes interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.  Fur  The guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have longer hollow medullae at their tips. There is also a difference in the frequency of fur colours: 66% of Eurasian beavers overall have beige or pale brown fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats; among North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish.  Head  The Eurasian beaver has a larger, less rounded head; a longer, narrower muzzle. The Eurasian beaver also has longer nasal bones, with the widest point being at the end of the snout; in the case of the North American beaver, the widest point is at the middle of the snout. The Eurasian beaver has a triangular nasal opening, unlike those of the North American beavers, which are square. Furthermore, the foramen magnum is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, but triangular in the North American beaver.  Body  The Eurasian beaver has a narrower, less oval-shaped tail; and shorter shin bones, making it less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. The anal glands of the Eurasian beaver are larger, and thin-walled, with a large internal volume, relative to that of the North American beaver. Behaviour and ecology Signs of beaver activity Large beaver dam in Lithuania Beaver lodge in Poland The Eurasian beaver is a keystone species, as it helps to support the ecosystem which it inhabits. It creates wetlands, which provide habitat for European water vole, Eurasian otter and Eurasian water shrew. By coppicing waterside trees and shrubs it facilitates their regrow as dense shrubs, thus providing cover for birds and other animals. Beavers build dams that trap sediment, improve water quality, recharge groundwater tables and increase cover and forage for trout and salmon. Also, abundance and diversity of vespertilionid bats increase, apparently because of gaps created in forests, making it easier for bats to navigate. =Reproduction= Sleeping Eurasian beaver in Osmussaar Tayside beaver with her kit Eurasian beavers have one litter per year, coming into estrus for only 12 to 24 hours, between late December and May, but peaking in January. Unlike most other rodents, beaver pairs are monogamous, staying together for multiple breeding seasons. Gestation averages 107 days and they average three kits per litter with a range of two to six kits. Most beavers do not reproduce until they are three years of age, but about 20% of two-year-old females reproduce. =Diet= European beavers are herbivorous, eating \\"water and river bank plants\\", including tubers, \\"rootstocks of myrtles, cattails, water lilies\\", and also trees, including softwood tree bark. Their long appendices and the microorganisms within make possible the digestion of bark cellulose. Their daily food intake is approximately 20% of their body weight. =Effects on fish= Beaver dam on Sosnovochka River in Penza Oblast, Russia Beaver ponds have been shown to have a beneficial effect on trout and salmon populations; in fact, many authors believe that the decline of salmonid fishes is related to the decline in beaver populations. A study of small streams in Sweden found that brown trout in beaver ponds were larger than those in riffle sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. These findings are similar to several studies of beaver effects on fish in North America. Brook trout, coho, and sockeye salmon were significantly larger in beaver ponds than those in unimpounded stream sections in Colorado and Alaska. In addition, research in the Stillaguamish River basin in Washington found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juveniles upstream from the dams suggests that the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows. Two-year- old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond. The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important (and underappreciated) in streams without deep pools or where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams. A 2003 study showed that Atlantic salmon and sea trout (S. trutta morpha trutta) spawning in the Numedalsl√•gen River and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern Norway were unhindered by beaver. In Norway, beaver dams are considered beneficial for brown and sea trout populations (these are potamodromous and anadromous forms of the same species). There, beaver ponds produce increased food for young fish and provide refuges for large adults heading upstream to spawn. =Effects on bats= Beaver modifications to streams in Poland have been associated with increased bat activity. While overall bat activity was increased, Myotis bat species, particularly Myotis daubentonii, activity may be hampered in locations where beaver ponds allow for increased presence of duckweed. =Effect on water quality= The misnomer ‚Äòbeaver fever‚Äô was invented by the American press in the 1970s after an outbreak of Giardia lamblia, which causes giardiasis, was blamed on beavers. However, the outbreak area was also frequented by humans, who are generally the primary source of contamination of waters. In addition, many animals and birds carry this parasite. Giardiasis affects humans in southeastern Norway, but a recent study found no Giardia in the beavers there. Recent concerns point to domestic animals as a significant vector of Giardia, with young calves in dairy herds testing as high as 100% positive for Giardia. New Zealand has Giardia but no beavers. In a 1995 paper recommending reintroduction of beaver to Great Britain, MacDonald stated that the only new diseases that beaver might convey to that country's birds and mammals, are rabies and tularemia - both diseases that should be preventable by statutory quarantine procedures and prophylactic treatment for tularemia. In addition, fecal coliform and streptococci bacteria excreted into streams by grazing cattle have been shown to be reduced by beaver ponds, where the bacteria are trapped in bottom sediments. In 2011, a Eurasian beaver pair was introduced to a beaver project site in West Devon, consisting of a large enclosure with a long channel and one pond. Within five years, the pair created a complex wetland with an extensive network of channels, 13 ponds and dams. Survey results showed that the created ponds hold of sediment, which stores of carbon and of nitrogen. Concentrations of carbon and nitrogen were significantly higher in these ponds than farther upstream of this site. These results indicate that the beavers' activity contributes to reducing the effects of soil erosion and pollution in agricultural landscapes. Distribution and habitat Beaver range in Europe by 2001: red indicates range of Eurasian beaver; purple indicates range of introduced North American beaver in Finland. In 2009, the Eurasian beaver was reintroduced into Great Britain. The Eurasian beaver is recovering from near extinction, after depredation by humans for its fur and for castoreum, a secretion of its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties. The estimated population was only 1,200 by the early 20th century. In many European nations, the Eurasian beaver became extinct, but reintroduction and protection programmes led to gradual recovery so that by 2003, the population comprised about 639,000 individuals. It likely survived east of the Ural Mountains from a 19th-century population as low as 300 animals. Factors contributing to their survival include their ability to maintain sufficient genetic diversity to recover from a population as low as three individuals, and that beavers are monogamous and select mates that are genetically different from themselves. About 83% of Eurasian beavers live in the former Soviet Union due to reintroductions. =Continental Europe= Eurasian beaver A Eurasian beaver in Estonia In Spain, nongovernment sanctioned reintroduction around 2003 has resulted in tell-tale beaver signs documented on a 60-km stretch on the lower course of the Aragon River and the area adjoining the Ebro River in Aragon, Spain. In France, the Eurasian beaver was almost extirpated by the late 19th century, with only a small population of about 100 individuals surviving in the lower Rh√¥ne valley. Following protection measures in 1968 and 26 reintroduction projects, it re-colonized the Rh√¥ne river and other river systems in the country such as Loire, Sa√¥ne, Moselle, Tarn and Seine rivers. In 2011, the French beaver population was estimated at 14,000 individuals living along watercourses. In Germany, around 200 Eurasian beavers survived by the end of the 19th century in the Elbe river system in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg. By 2016, beavers numbered up to 25,000 across Germany, even appearing in many urban areas. The largest beaver population lives in eastern Germany with about 6,000 individuals descended from Elbe beavers, and in Bavaria along the Danube and its tributaries. After a resettlement programme started in 1966, around 14,000 individuals are estimated in Bavaria. In Switzerland, the Eurasian beaver was extirpated in the early 19th century due to hunting for its fur, meat and castoreum. Between 1956 and 1977, 141 individuals were reintroduced to 30 sites in the Rhone and Rhine catchment areas. They originated in France, Russia and Norway. Beavers were reintroduced in the Netherlands in 1988 after being completely exterminated in the 19th century. After its reintroduction in the Biesbosch, the Dutch population has spread considerably (supported by additional reintroductions), and can now be found in the Biesbosch and surrounding areas, along the Meuse in Limburg, and in the Gelderse Poort and Oostvaardersplassen. In 2012, the population was estimated to be about 600 animals and could easily grow to 7000 in 20 years' time. According to the Mammal Society and the Dutch Water Board, this will cause a threat to the river dikes. The main problem is that beavers excavate corridors and caves in dikes, thereby undermining the stability of the dike, just as the muskrat and the coypu do. If problems become unmanageable, as local administrators in Limburg fear, the beaver will be captured again. As of 2014, the beaver population in Poland reached 100,000 individuals. and was still growing. After major flooding in Poland in May and June 2010, the local authorities of Konin in central Poland held beavers responsible for causing the flooding and demanded the culling of 150 beavers. In Romania, beavers became extinct in 1824, but were reintroduced in 1998 along the Olt River, spreading to other rivers in Covasna County. In 2014, the animals were confirmed to have reached the Danube Delta. In the former Soviet Union, almost 17,000 beavers were translocated from 1927 to 2004, of which 12,000 were to Russia, and the remainder to the Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic States, and Kazakhstan. The beaver is now common in Estonia and Latvia. In Greece, the Eurasian beaver was present in the Last Glacial Period as remains were found in Epirus.Gamble, C. 1999: Faunal exploitation at Klithi: a Late Glacial rockshelter in Epirus, Northwestern Greece.

In 4th century BCE Aristotle described this species under the name ŒõŒ¨œÑŒ±Œæ/Latax. He wrote that it is wider than the otter, with strong teeth and that it gets often in the night to the river banks to cut down trees with these teeth.ŒëœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÑŒ≠ŒªŒ∑œÇ 4th century BC: Œ§œâŒΩ œÄŒµœÅŒØ œÑŒ± Œ∂œéŒ± ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπœéŒΩ. Œôt remains unclear when they vanished from Kastoria which was possibly named after Kastor/Castor which means beaver, but in the 18th century CE the locals were still hunting them for their fur. In the 19th century, it still occurred in Alpheius in the Peloponnese and in Mesolongi. In Bulgaria, fossil, subfossil and subrecent remains were found in 43 localities along 28 Bulgarian lowland (till 550 m a.s.l.) rivers, ranging from Struma and Maritsa in the south till the Danube in the north, while the last data from Nicopolis ad Istrum date to the 1750-1850 period.Boev, Z. & N.

In Serbia, beavers were mainly extinct by the 1870s, the last specimens being spotted in the 1900-1902 period. Four families with five members each, plus 11 single animals (31 in total) were reintroduced in 2004 in the Zasavica reserve, by the Biology Faculty of the Belgrade University in collaboration with the Bavarian Science Society. Additional 45 animals were released in the Obedska bara reserve. They began building dams and to reproduce almost right away. By 2020, they spread for in the north, west and east direction, inhabiting rivers in the Sava-Danube system (Drina, Jadar, Great Morava, Tamnava, Tisza, Bega, Timi»ô, canal system in Vojvodina), including the capital Belgrade and the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Zasavica site The recently resurgent beaver population in Eurasia has resulted in increases in human-beaver encounters. Indeed, in May 2013, a Belarusian fisherman died after being bitten several times by a beaver, severing an artery in his leg and causing him to bleed to death. =Scandinavia= In Denmark, the Eurasian beaver became extinct around the year 1000. In 1999, 18 Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to the Flynder creek in a State Forest in northwestern Denmark that originated from Elbe river in Germany. This population nearly tripled until 2003 and spread in the whole creek. , this population was estimated at 139 individuals. In northern Zealand, 23 Eurasian beavers were reintroduced between 2009 and 2011. In Sweden, the Eurasian beaver had been hunted to extinction by around 1870. Between 1922 and 1939, about 80 individuals were imported from Norway and introduced to 19 separate sites within the country. Beavers were reintroduced to central Norway's Ingdalselva River watershed on the Agdenes peninsula in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag County in 1968-1969. The area is hilly to mountainous with many small watersheds. Rivers are usually too steep along most of their length for beaver colonisation, so that suitable habitat is scattered, with rarely room for more than one territory in a habitat patch. While widespread signs of vagrant beavers were found, spread as a breeding animal was slowed by watershed divides in the hilly terrain. Suitable sites within watersheds were rapidly colonised. Some spread could only be plausibly explained by assuming travel through sheltered sea water in fjords. Some Eurasian beavers are present in Finland, but most of the Finnish population is a released North American beaver population. =Great Britain= Beaver dam, Scotland The same dam four months later Beaver tracks in snow The Eurasian beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the 16th century. The last reference to beavers in England dates to 1526. A population of Eurasian beaver of unknown origin has been present on the River Otter, Devon in south-west England since 2008. An additional pair was released to increase genetic diversity in 2016. As part of a scientific study, a pair of Eurasian beaver was released in 2011 near Dartmoor in southern Devon. The 13 beaver ponds now in place impacted flooding to the extent of releasing precipitation over days to weeks instead of hours. Free-living beaver populations also occur around the River Tay and Knapdale areas in Scotland. The Knapdale population was released by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, while the other populations are of unknown origin. Sixteen beavers were released between 2009 and 2014 in Knapdale forest, Argyll. In 2016, the Scottish government declared that the beaver populations in Knapdale and Tayside could remain and naturally expand. This is the first successful reintroduction of a wild mammal in the United Kingdom. In 2019, a beaver pair was reintroduced in East Anglia for the first time. The four hectare enclosure on a farm in North Essex is part of a flood risk reduction project designed to reduce property flooding. The impact on flooding, wildlife and rural tourism is monitored by a private landowner. = Asia = In Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey, subfossil evidence of beavers extends down to the floodplains of the Tigris-Euphrates basin, and a carved stone stela dating between 1,000 and 800 BC in the Tell Halaf archaeological site along the Khabur River in northeastern Syria depicts a beaver. Although accounts of 19th-century European visitors to the Middle East appear to confuse beavers with otters, a 20th-century report of beavers by Hans Kummerl√∂we in the Ceyhan River drainage of southern Turkey includes the diagnostic red incisor teeth, flat, scaly tail, and presence of gnawed willow stems. According to the Encyclopaedia Iranica, early Iranian Avestan and Pahlavi, and later Islamic literature, all reveal different words for otter and beaver, and castoreum was highly valued. Johannes Ludwijk Schlimmer, a noted Dutch physician in 19th-century Iran reported beavers below the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates in small numbers, along the bank of the Shatt al-Arab in the provinces of Shushtar and Dezful. Austen Layard reported finding beavers during his visit to the Kabur River in Syria the 1850s, but noted they were being rapidly hunted to extirpation. Beavers were specifically sacred to Zoroastrianism (which also revered otters), and there were laws in place for unlawful killing of these animals. In China, a few hundred beavers live in the basin of the Ulungur River near the international border with Mongolia. The Bulgan Beaver Nature Reserve (; ) was established in 1980 to protect the creatures.  Conservation  The Eurasian beaver Castor fiber was once widespread in Europe and Asia but by the beginning of the 20th century both the numbers and range of the species had been drastically diminished, mainly due to hunting. At this time, the global population was estimated to be around 1,200 individuals, living in eight separate sub-populations. In 2008, however, the IUCN granted the Eurasian Beaver a status of least concern, with the justification that the species had recovered sufficiently with the help of global conservation programmes. Currently the largest numbers can be found across Europe, where reintroductions have been successful in 25 countries and conservation efforts are ongoing. However, populations in Asia remain small and fragmented, and are under considerable threat. = Reintroduction into Scotland = The first sustained and significant population of wild-living beavers in the United Kingdom became established on the river Tay catchment in Scotland as early as 2001, and spread widely in the catchment, numbering from 20 to 100 individuals. Because these beavers were either escapees from any of several nearby sites with captive beavers, or illegal releases, Scottish Natural Heritage initially planned to remove the Tayside beavers in late 2010. Proponents of the beavers argued that no reason existed to believe that they were of \\"wrong\\" genetic stock, and that they should be permitted to remain. One beaver was trapped by Scottish Natural Heritage on the River Ericht in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, in early December 2010, and was held in captivity in the Edinburgh Zoo. In March 2012 the Scottish Government reversed the decision to remove beavers from the Tay, pending the outcome of studies into the suitability of re-introduction. In 2005, the Scottish government had turned down a licence application for unfenced reintroduction. However, in late 2007, a further application was made by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, Scottish Wildlife Trust and Forestry Commission Scotland for a release project in Knapdale, Argyll. This application, termed the Scottish Beaver Trial, was accepted, and the first beavers were released on 29 May 2009 after a 400-year absence, with further releases in 2010. In August 2010, at least two kits, estimated to be eight weeks old and belonging to different family groups, were seen in Knapdale Forest in Argyll. Alongside the trial, the pre-existing population of beavers along the Tay was monitored and assessed. Following receipt of the results of the Scottish Beaver Trial, in November 2016 the Scottish Government announced that beavers could remain permanently, and would be given protected status as a native species within Scotland. Beavers will be allowed to extend their range naturally from Knapdale and the River Tay, however to aid this process and improve the health and resilience of the population a further 28 beavers will be released in Knapdale between 2017 and 2020. A survey of beaver numbers during the winter of 2017-18 estimated that the Tayside population had increased to between 300-550 beavers, with beavers now also present in the catchment of the River Forth, and the Trossachs area. = Reintroduction into England and Wales = A group of three beavers was spotted on the River Otter in Devon in 2013, apparently successfully bearing three kits the next year. Following concern from local landowners and anglers, as well as farmers worrying that the beavers could carry disease, the government announced that it would capture the beavers and place them in a zoo or wildlife park. A sport-fishing industry lobbyist group, the Angling Trust, said, \\"it would be irresponsible even to consider re-introducing this species into the wild without first restoring our rivers to good health.\\" These actions were protested by local residents and campaign groups, with environmental journalist George Monbiot describing the government and anglers as 'control freaks': \\"I'm an angler, and the Angling Trust does not represent me on this issue...most anglers, in my experience, have a powerful connection with nature. The chance of seeing remarkable wild animals while waiting quietly on the riverbank is a major part of why we do it.\\" On 28 January 2015, Natural England declared that the beavers would be allowed to remain on condition that they were free of disease and of Eurasian descent. These conditions were found to be met on 23 March 2015, following the capture and testing of five of the beavers. DNA testing showed that the animals were the once-native Eurasian beaver, and none of the beavers was found to be infected with Echinococcus multilocularis, tularaemia, or bovine TB. On 24 June 2015, video footage from local filmmaker Tom Buckley was featured on the BBC news website showing one of the wild Devon females with two live young. A study has been undertaken on the feasibility and desirability of a reintroduction of beavers to Wales by a partnership including the Wildlife Trusts, Countryside Council for Wales, Peoples Trust for Endangered Species, Environment Agency Wales, Wild Europe, and Forestry Commission Wales, with additional funding from Welsh Power Ltd. The resulting reports were published in 2012 with the launch of the Welsh Beaver Project, which is a partnership led by the Wildlife in Wales, and are downloadable from www.welshbeaverproject.org. A 2009 report by Natural England, the government‚Äôs conservation body, and the People's Trust for Endangered Species recommended that beavers be reintroduced to the wild in England. This goal was realised in November 2016, when beavers were recognised as a British native species. = In captivity = In 2001, the Kent Wildlife Trust with the Wildwood Trust and Natural England imported two families of Eurasian beavers from Norway to manage a wetland nature reserve. This project pioneered the use of beavers as a wildlife conservation tool in the UK. The success of this project has provided the inspiration behind other projects in Gloucestershire and Argyll. The Kent beaver colony lives in a fenced enclosure at the wetland of Ham Fen. Subsequently, the population has been supplemented in 2005 and 2008. The beavers continue to help restore the wetland by rehydrating the soils. Six Eurasian beavers were released in 2005 into a fenced lakeside area in Gloucestershire. In 2007, a specially selected group of four Bavarian beavers was released into a fenced enclosure in the Martin Mere nature reserve in Lancashire. The beavers hopefully will form a permanent colony, and the younger pair will be transferred to another location when the adults begin breeding again. The progress of the group will be followed as part of the BBC's Autumnwatch television series. On 19 November 2011, a pair of beaver sisters was released into a enclosure at Blaeneinion, Furnace, Mid Wales. A colony of beavers is also established in a large enclosure at Bamff, Perthshire. In June 2017, a pair of beavers (one male and one female, with hopes that they would become a breeding pair) were released into a secured area in Cornwall near Ladock. This was called The Beaver Project, and was funded through a very successful crowdfunded campaign led by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The aims of this project are split into several objectives; hydrology, water quality, impact on fish, ecology, and observation of the public perception of beaver reintroduction. As written on the Cornwall Wildlife Trust website: \\"The impacts of the beavers on water quantity and quality are being monitored by University of Exeter researchers who have had equipment on site for well over a year prior to the release of beavers. Some biodiversity monitoring is also being carried out including habitats, amphibians, bats, some invertebrate groups and fish. The project fits in scale between the fenced Devon trial and the River Otter Beaver Project. The potential to alleviate flooding is particularly important since the site is situated upstream of Ladock, a village increasingly affected by flooding.\\" There have been video updates and more since then, and there have recently been hopes that the pair have successfully bred pups, although this is yet to be confirmed. On 24 July 2018 two Eurasian beavers were released into a fenced area in size surrounding Greathough Brook near Lydbrook in the Forest of Dean. The UK Government hopes that the presence of the beavers on Forestry Commission land will help to alleviate flooding in a natural way as the animals will construct dams and ponds, slowing the flow of water in the area. The village of Lydbrook was badly affected by flooding in 2012. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who attended the release, said: > \\"The beaver has a special place in English heritage and the Forest of Dean. > This release is a fantastic opportunity to develop our understanding of the > potential impacts of reintroductions and help this iconic species, 400 years > after it was driven to extinction.\\" See also * Knapdale in Argyll, Great Britain¬ßEnvironment  References   External links  * Scottish Beaver Trial Category:Beavers Category:Mammals described in 1758 Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Rodents of Europe Category:Mammals of Mongolia Category:Mammals of Russia Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Eurasian beaver"},{"id":"890244","text":"Dannreuther, 1898 Edward George Dannreuther (4 November 1844, Strasbourg ‚Äì 12 February 1905, Hastings) was a German pianist and writer on music, resident from 1863 in England. His father had crossed the Atlantic, moving to Cincinnati, and there established a piano manufacturing business. Young Edward, under pressure from his father to enter banking as a career, a prospect he found uncongenial, escaped to Leipzig in 1859. He trained as a musician at the Leipzig Conservatoire, where he was a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles. A youthful champion of Wagner, he founded the London Wagner Society in 1872. In 1863 he had been recruited by Henry Chorley to play the piano in London at the Crystal Palace concerts. His performances of Chopin and Beethoven were well received; after his marriage in 1871 he decided to settle permanently in England. His two-volume work Musical Ornamentation was for many years the standard text, and an important influence on the evolving trend of performance practice. Dannreuther became a professor of piano at the Royal College of Music in 1895, a position he held until his death. An enthusiast for new music, he was an important influence on the composer Hubert Parry, who was his pupil.Dibble, Jeremy, \\"Parry, Sir (Charles) Hubert Hastings, baronet (1848‚Äì1918)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 April 2013 A memorial plaque on his former home at 12 Orme Square, Westminster, London was unveiled on 26 July 2005.\\"Edward Danreuther\\" , City of Westminster green plaques His son Hubert Edward Dannreuther (1880‚Äì1977) was a British admiral and one of six survivors of the sinking of HMS Invincible.

Eddy but much of the content referencing him can be found under his nickname Jack which he preferred to use. In 1976 Dr. Eddy published a landmark paper in Science titled \\"The Maunder Minimum\\" where, using the Nineteenth Century works of Edward W. Maunder and Gustav Sp√∂rer, he identified a 70-year period from 1645 to 1715 as a time when solar activity all but stopped. In making the case for the anomaly, he gathered and interpreted data from a wide variety of sources, including first-hand accounts from extant historical observations of the Sun going back to the telescopic observations of Galileo and other contemporary scientists of the 17th and early 18th centuries; from historical reports of the aurora borealis observed in past centuries in Europe and the New World; from visual observations of sunspots seen with the unaided eye at sunrise and sunset in dynastic records from the Orient; from existing descriptions of the eclipsed Sun; and from measurements of carbon-14 in dated tree-rings. In the last of these, which can be used as a proxy indicator of solar activity, he found evidence of other similar periods of solar quiescence in the distant past, the most recent an even longer 90-year span, from about 1460 until 1550, which he named the Sp√∂rer Minimum. Both the Maunder and Sp√∂rer minima fell during the coldest parts of the Little Ice Age, which suggested a meaningful connection between the longer term behavior of the Sun and of the Earth's mean surface temperature. In advancing the theory that the Sun is a variable star Eddy observed: \\"It has long been thought that the Sun is a constant star of regular and repeatable behavior. Measurements of the radiative output, or solar constant, seem to justify the first assumption, and the record of periodicity in sunspot numbers is taken as evidence of the second. Both records, however, sample only the most recent history of the Sun.\\" Childhood and education Midshipman John Allen Eddy, U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1953.United States Naval Academy - Lucky Bag Yearbook, Class of 1953, Page 334John Eddy was born (March 25, 1931) and raised in Pawnee City, Nebraska, a small town of 1600 people in the southeastern corner of the state. John's brother Robert was two years his senior and his sister Lucille was two years his younger. John's father managed a cooperative farm store where John worked until he started high school. John's mother had attained college for one year and was a county schoolteacher until she married John's father. The Eddy family lived in a modest but happy home but were of limited economic means and there was serious concerns that they could not afford a college education for John. As it turned out, John was the only member of the family to graduate from college. In 1948 John attended Doane College in Crete, Nebraska for one year, a distance of some from his home. In 1949 he was appointed by Senator Kenneth Wherry (R) of Nebraska, who also resided in Pawnee City, to the U.S. Naval Academy. At Annapolis, there were few science courses but John attended a course in celestial navigation and it was this course which gave John a love of the sky. So great was his interest in the night sky that once after Taps, John crawled out on the roof of Bancroft Hall to look for the Constellation Draco and was caught by an officer who gave him 5 hours of extra duty for not being in bed. Upon graduation in 1953 from the United States Naval Academy he served for four years at sea as a line officer on aircraft carriers during the Korean War and later in the Persian Gulf as navigator and operations officer on a destroyer in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1957 he left active service in the Navy to continue his education. He was discharged and accepted into the graduate school at the University of Colorado's mathematics program but switched departments, before the start of the Fall 1957 semester, upon discovering the University's little observatory and a small program in astro- geophysics that had just been started, becoming the program's first student. Later he joined the High Altitude Observatory at the University of Colorado.Interview with Jack Eddy, April 21, 1999: In Michigan by phone, conducted by Spencer Weart Academic career As a protege of Gordon Newkirk, Eddy worked with Princeton Professor Martin Schwarzschild in studying the solar corona with coronagraphs mounted on weather balloons at altitudes of . Eddy's thesis was in this area of study. Eddy completed his PhD Thesis at the University of Colorado at Boulder in December 1961 titled \\"The Stratospheric Solar Aureole\\". > Abstract: The theory of light scattering by small particles is summarized to > develop the formulae needed to interpret solar aureole data obtained in > balloon flights at stratospheric altitudes. Included are the Rayleihg law > for small particles, the Chandrasekhar solution of the planetary scattering > problem, and the Mie theory for large particle scattering. Observations > cover the wavelength range from 0.37 to 0.79 micrometre at the scattering > angle 2.4 degrees, and over the altitude range from 42,000 ft. to 80,000 ft. > The findings suggest that the form of the particle size distribution changes > with altitude, becoming a steeper function of particle radius at higher > altitudes. After achieving his PhD, Eddy went into teaching, while maintaining an active research schedule to maintain his credentials. He studied spectral lines and particularly doing work in infrared spectroscopy. Interdisciplinary work Eddy received much criticism from within the astronomy community for his interdisciplinary work on Native American medicine wheels, showing how they were used as calendars and observatories.Eddy, J.A., \\"Astronomical Alignment of the Big Horn Medicine Wheel\\", Science 184, pp. 1035-1043, 1974 It also earned him criticism from archaeologists at first, although his work was eventually accepted, and even documented in National Geographic and as a guest on TV and radio programs. As a teacher, he frequently used historical examples to put his students at ease with the idea that not so long ago nobody knew more than they did about solar physics. This caused him to do a lot of research in the history of his own field, particularly covering records of past eclipses and sunspot counts, whereupon he discovered the records of Maunder and others demonstrating that there was indeed long term variability in solar activity. Eugene Parker of the University of Chicago, when promoting his theory of the existence of a solar wind, which caused Parker to receive much scorn from the community, exposed Eddy to the work of Maunder vis a vis sunspot records. Post-academia Eddy was laid off from the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in 1973 due to budget cutbacks and the poor performance reviews he earned due to his interdisciplinary forays, which were frowned upon at the time. He then was hired by NASA to write a book, which enabled him to travel east to do research in the great astronomy libraries, particularly at Harvard and the Naval Observatory, which he used to also do research on the Maunder Minimum. His work on this was published in the journal Science as a cover story,Eddy, J.A., \\"The Maunder Minimum\\", Science 18 June 1976: Vol. 192. no. 4245, pp. 1189 - 1202, PDF Copy and established his fame. After publication, his former employers at the HAO tried to hire him back. The fame resulting from \\"The Maunder Minimum\\" paper landed him on the international lecture circuit, giving over 50 talks a year around the world about his work and history. In 1987 Eddy was awarded the Arctowski MedalArctowski Medal, National Academy of Sciences by the National Academy of Sciences for studies in solar physics and solar- terrestrial relationships and specifically for \\"his demonstration of the existence and nature of solar variations of long term and the consequences of these changes for climate and for mankind.\\" Petition to name the next significant solar minimum There was an online petition underway, organized by Anthony Watts, to be submitted to the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society in June 2009, in Boulder, Colorado by solar astronomer Leif Svalgaard,Dr. Leif Svalgaard's Research Page to name the next significant solar minimum the \\"Eddy Minimum\\" to honor Eddy's contributions to this line of research. During an interview, in a statement which may yet prove prophetic, Eddy first used the term \\"Eddy Minimum\\" while explaining why he rejected it: > EDDY: And, you know, the temptation was to think that it might someday be > called the \\"Eddy Minimum\\": that is, to call it nothing in the hope that > someone else would do that. But being from Nebraska, I could never do > anything like that. I also knew I wasn't the first to find it, and it wasn't > really mine. I think I did quite a bit for Maunder with that name. > Particularly because he also got the idea from somebody else. He got it from > Sporer who was a German astronomer. So, among the shots I took after > publishing the paper were some from Germany that said, \\"You know, you really > named it after the wrong person.\\" Which I knew very well. While Eddy did not predict the next significant solar minimum he did identify that we are living by the light of a variable star and it is for this reason it is said that the next significant solar minimum should be named in his honor. He cautioned:The Sun: A Biography by David Whitehouse, page 225. > It was one more defeat in our long and losing battle to keep the Sun > perfect, or, if not perfect, constant, and if inconstant, regular. Why we > think the Sun should be any of these when other stars are not is more a > question for social than for physical science. Death John A.

The Statistics Act gives Statistics Canada the authority to \\"collect, compile, analyze, abstract, and publish information on the economic, social and general conditions of the country and its citizens.\\" To balance Statistics Canada's extensive powers to collect information, the Act establishes the legal requirement for the agency to protect the confidentiality of respondents to Statistics Canada surveys. The legislation makes a formal commitment to respondents that the information they provide will never be released to anyone in a form that will identify them without their authorization. Legal requirement Citizens who refuse to participate in providing information, or who provide false information, have committed an offence under the ActStatistics Act under c. S-19: ...information collected under the authority of the Statistics Act, R.S.C. 1985...and must be provided by law. Refusal to provide information: ...are liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or/and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. \\"Voluntary surveys 8\\\\. The Minister may, by order, authorize the obtaining, for a particular purpose, of information, other than information for a census of population or agriculture, on a voluntary basis, but where such information is requested section 31 does not apply in respect of a refusal or neglect to furnish the information. 1980-81-82-83, c. 47, s. 41.\\" Other legislation relating to this act include: * Access to Information Act 1983 * Privacy Act 1983 Consent to release future census records After years of study by expert panels, discussion, debate (privacy vs the interests of genealogists and historians), and two earlier legislative attempts, Bill S-18 An Act to Amend the Statistics Act received Royal Assent on June 18, 2005. The 2005 Act creates section 18.1 of the Statistics Act which releases personal census records for censuses taken between 1911 and 2001, inclusive, 92 years after each census. In addition, starting with the 2006 Census, Canadians can consent to the public release of their personal census information after 92 years. (See Question 53 of Canada 2006 Census.) Census returns are in the custody of Statistics Canada and the records are closed until 92 years after the taking of a census, when those records may be opened for public use and transferred to Library and Archives Canada subject to individual consent where applicable. 2016 Amendments In 2010, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper passed an Order in Council determining that only the short-form Census would be mandatory during the 2011 round of the Census. The mandatory long-form Census was transformed into an optional National Household Survey .. This change to the Census was the subject of much controversy. Following the election of the liberal government of Justin Trudeau, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development introduced in the House of Commons Bill C-36, An Act to amend the Statistics Act on 7 December 2016. The amendments were passed by Royal Assent on December 13, 2017. The Government of Canada press release stated that the amendments were made to the Statistics Act to \\"ensure that decisions on statistical matters are transparent and are based on professional considerations.\\" The amendments to the Act were intended to: \\"‚Ä¢strengthen the independence and powers of the Chief Statistician; ‚Ä¢ensure greater transparency regarding the directives issued to the Chief Statistician; ‚Ä¢establish the Canadian Statistics Advisory Council; ‚Ä¢protect personal information provided in response to Statistics Canada‚Äôs requests; and ‚Ä¢remove imprisonment as a penalty for individuals who refuse or neglect to respond to Statistics Canada‚Äôs requests or who provide false information\\" The changes to the Act included empowering the Chief Statistician to \\"decide, based strictly on professional statistical standards that he or she considers appropriate, the methods and procedures for carrying out statistical programs regarding (i) the collection, compilation, analysis, abstraction and publication of statistical information that is produced or is to be produced by Statistics Canada\\".

A 2013 Guggenheim Fellow, Melford was described by the San Francisco Chronicle as an \\"explosive player, a virtuoso who shocks and soothes, and who can make the piano stand up and do things it doesn't seem to have been designed for.\\"  Early life and education  Melford was born in Evanston, Illinois and was raised in a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. At 3, she started playing the piano on her own, climbing onto the piano bench and improvising, and began taking lessons when she was in kindergarten. She developed a strong relationship with her teacher, Erwin Helfer, a classically trained boogie-woogie player. Helfer introduced her to classical composers such as Bach before moving on to contemporary composers, such as Bart√≥k, and later taught her to play the blues. Melford attended blues festivals, and because of her relationship with Helfer, she was often invited backstage, where she encountered many of Chicago's most acclaimed performers. Independently, Melford also began to explore improvisation. Pushed towards performing classical repertoire, Melford attended a Northwestern University extension program in junior high school. She described her experience as a classical piano student as \\"not right,\\" and while she continued to play informally, she stopped her formal studies in high school. Melford enrolled at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, where she intended to study environmental science. Although she was not then listening to jazz, and had not grown up listening to it, she knew that it involved improvisation, and when she saw an advertisement for jazz piano lessons in a local restaurant, she began studying again. She recalled that, during the next few years, \\"There were two records... which were on constant repeat: Cecil Taylor's Air Above Mountains and Ornette Coleman's The Shape of Jazz to Come.\\" Shortly thereafter, she switched her major to music, and in 1980 attended Cornish College of the Arts and studied with Art Lande and Gary Peacock. While living in Olympia, Melford met prominent avant-garde musicians including Oliver Lake, Anthony Braxton, Marty Ehrlich and Leroy Jenkins, whose performance with Amina Claudine Myers and Pheeroan akLaff inspired an \\"ecstatic feeling\\" which intensified her commitment to improvisation.  Career  Melford moved to New York City in 1984, where she studied composition with saxophonist Henry Threadgill, whom she would later cite as a major influence on her perception of organic composition. She also studied privately with pianists Jaki Byard and Don Pullen, whose percussive mannerisms she adapted. After arriving in New York, Melford performed in the bands of Threadgill, Leroy Jenkins, and Butch Morris, among others. In the late 1980s she played and recorded with flutist Marion Brandis, and formed a trio with bassist Lindsey Horner and drummer Reggie Nicholson. Her career accelerated in the early 1990s, as she participated in the first Knitting Factory tour of Europe, and recorded three albums with Horner and Nicholson: Jump (1990), Now & Now (1991), and Alive in the House of Saints, a live album, in 1993. Later in the 1990s, Melford moved toward larger groupings with diverse instrumentation, and added trumpeter Dave Douglas and reed player Marty Ehrlich to her trio lineup to create a quintet, the Myra Melford Extended Ensemble. She also formed a second five-piece, the Same River, Twice, featuring Douglas, cellist Erik Friedlander, reed player Chris Speed, and drummer Michael Sarin. Their self-titled debut album was released on Gramavision in 1996, followed by 1999's Above Blue on Arabesque. Melford also appeared as an improvisational collaborator on the 1996 Hatology release Eleven Ghosts, featuring duets performed with Dutch drummer Han Bennink; and Equal Interest, a 1999 Omnitone release by the trio of the same name, featuring Melford with Jenkins and Joseph Jarman of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. With Equal Interest, Melford performed on harmonium as well as piano. By the close of the decade, Melford had become one of the downtown jazz scene's most celebrated performers and composers, with the Seattle Times describing her in 1999 as an \\"explosive pianist who alternately caresses and pounds the keyboard and weaves brilliant swatches of composed material into free-form improvisation.\\" In 2000, Melford formed Crush, a trio in which she played piano and harmonium with Kenny Wollesen on drums and Stomu Takeishi on electric bass. Arabesque released the trio's Dance Beyond the Color later that year. In September, she traveled to Calcutta to study harmonium with Sohanlal Sharma as a Fulbright scholar. She spent several months with Sharma, focusing on raga and Hindustani classical music, and continued her studies with other musicians in Delhi and Rajistan. She additionally studied with Sudhir Nayak in Mumbai. After returning to the United States, Melford lived at an upstate New York ashram. She subsequently formed an ensemble expressly to play music based on her studies in India, Myra Melford's Be Bread. Although it remained unreleased until 2006, Be Bread's debut album, The Image of Your Body (whose title was derived from a Rumi poem), was recorded in 2003, as was Where the Two Worlds Touch by Myra Melford's The Tent, released by Arabesque. Melford relocated to Berkeley, California in 2004 to accept a position as Professor of contemporary improvisational music, University of California Berkeley. In 2006, along with bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Matt Wilson, Melford formed Trio M, who released their debut album, The Big Picture, on Cryptogramophone in 2007. It was followed by The Guest House on Enja/Yellowbird in 2012. Melford performs with clarinetist/composer Ben Goldberg, who she met just after she moved to Berkeley, in the duo Dialogue. Melford formed a new quintet, Snowy Egret, featuring bassist Takeishi, guitarist Liberty Ellman, trumpeter Ron Miles, and drummer Tyshawn Sorey in 2012. In October, Melford won the 2012 Alpert Award for \\"her ascending and expansive trajectory, great, generous musical mind and her ability to take multiple musical traditions into another sphere.\\" Melford released her first solo album in October 2013. Titled Life Carries Me This Way, the album is a collection of work inspired by the paintings of the late visual artist Don Reich. That same year, she was named a Guggenheim Fellow and received both the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation's Performing Artist Award and a Doris Duke Residency to Build Demand for the Arts for her efforts to re-imagine the jazz program at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts; in November, Snowy Egret performed the music for Melford's multimedia project Language of Dreams, at the center. At Berkeley, Melford has developed and taught a series of courses in contemporary jazz and improvisation-based music for performers and composers in addition to lecturing on innovations in jazz since the 1960s and other topics in contemporary improvised music.

It is similar in colour to the American mink, but is slightly smaller and has a less specialized skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the European mink is not closely related to the American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and Siberian weasel (kolonok).MARMI, J., L√ìPEZ- GIR√ÅLDEZ, J.F. & DOMINGO-ROURA, X. (2004). Phylogeny, Evolutionary History and Taxonomy of the Mustelidae based on Sequences of the Cytochrome b Gene and a Complex Repetitive Flanking Region. Zoologica Scripta, 33: 481 - 499 The European mink occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects. The European mink is listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered due to an ongoing reduction in numbers, having been calculated as declining more than 50% over the past three generations and expected to decline at a rate exceeding 80% over the next three generations. European mink numbers began to shrink during the 19th century, with the species rapidly becoming extinct in some parts of Central Europe. During the 20th century, mink numbers declined all throughout their range, the reasons for which having been hypothesised to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, competition with (as well as diseases spread by) the introduced American mink, habitat destruction, declines in crayfish numbers and hybridisation with the European polecat. In Central Europe and Finland, the decline preceded the introduction of the American mink, having likely been due to the destruction of river ecosystems, while in Estonia, the decline seems to coincide with the spread of the American mink.Maran, T. and Henttonen, H. 1995. Why is the European mink, Mustela lutreola disappearing? - A review of the process and hypotheses. Annales Fennici Zoologici 32: 47-54. Evolution and taxonomy Fossil finds of the European mink are very rare, thus indicating the species is either a relative newcomer to Europe, probably having originated in North America, or a recent speciation caused by hybridization. It likely first arose in the Middle Pleistocene, with several fossils in Europe dated to the Late Pleistocene being found in caves and some suggesting early exploitation by humans. Genetic analyses indicate, rather than being closely related to the American mink, the European mink's closest relative is the European polecat (perhaps due to past hybridization)Davidson, A., Griffith, H. I., Brookes, R. C., Maran, T., MacDonald, D. W., Sidorovich, V. E., Kitchener, A. C., Irizar, I., Villate, I., Gonzales-Esteban, J., Cena, A., Moya, I. and Palazon Minano, S. 2000.

However, compared to its close relative, the Siberian weasel, the mink is more compact and less thinly built, thus approaching ferrets and European polecats in build. The European mink has a large, broad head with short ears. The limbs are short, with relatively well-developed membranes between the digits, particularly on the hind feet. The mink's tail is short, and does not exceed half the animal's body length (constituting about 40% of its length). The European mink's skull is less elongated than the kolonok's, with more widely spaced zygomatic arches and has a less massive facial region. In general characteristics, the skull is intermediate in shape between that of the Siberian weasel and the European polecat. Overall, the skull is less specialized for carnivory than that of polecats and the American mink. Males measure in body length, while females measure . Tail length is in males and . Overall weight is . It is a fast and agile animal, which swims and dives skilfully. It is able to run along stream beds, and stay underwater for one to two minutes. When swimming, it paddles with both its front and back limbs simultaneously. =Fur= European mink face - note the white markings on the upper lip, which are absent in the American species. The winter fur of the European mink is very thick and dense, but not long, and quite loosely fitting. The underfur is particularly dense compared with that of more land- based members of the genus Mustela. The guard hairs are quite coarse and lustrous, with very wide contour hairs which are flat in the middle, as is typical in aquatic mammals. The length of the hairs on the back and belly differ little, a further adaptation to the European mink's semiaquatic way of life. The summer fur is somewhat shorter, coarser and less dense than the winter fur, though the differences are much less than in purely terrestrial mustelids. In dark coloured individuals, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown, while light individuals are reddish brown. Fur colour is evenly distributed over the whole body, though in a few cases, the belly is a bit lighter than the upper parts. In particularly dark individuals, a dark, broad dorsal belt is present. The limbs and tail are slightly darker than the trunk. The face has no colour pattern, though its upper and lower lips and chin are pure white. White markings may also occur on the lower surface of the neck and chest. Occasionally, colour mutations such as albinos and white spots throughout the pelage occur. The summer fur is somewhat lighter, and dirty in tone, with more reddish highlights. =Differences from American mink= The European mink is similar to the American mink, but with several important differences. The tail is longer in the American species, almost reaching half its body length. The winter fur of the American mink is denser, longer and more closely fitting than that of the European mink. Unlike the European mink, which has white patches on both upper and lower lips, the American mink almost never has white marks on the upper lip. The European mink's skull is much less specialised than the American species' in the direction of carnivory, bearing more infantile features, such as a weaker dentition and less strongly developed projections. The European mink is reportedly less efficient than the American species underwater.Youngman, Phillip M. (1990). Mustela lutreola, Mammalian Species, American Society of Mammalogists, No. 362, pp. 1-3, 2 figs Behaviour =Territorial and denning behaviours= European mink by a pond The European mink does not form large territories, possibly due to the abundance of food on the banks of small water bodies. The size of each territory varies according to the availability of food; in areas with water meadows with little food, the home range is , though it is more usual for territories to be . Summer territories are smaller than winter territories. Along shorelines, the length of a home range varies from , with a width of . The European mink has both a permanent burrow and temporary shelters. The former is used all year except during floods, and is located no more than from the water's edge. The construction of the burrow is not complex, often consisting of one or two passages in diameter and in length, leading to a nest chamber measuring . Nesting chambers are lined with straw, moss, mouse wool and bird feathers. It is more sedentary than the American mink, and will confine itself for long periods in its burrow in very cold weather. =Reproduction and development= During the mating season, the sexual organs of the female enlarge greatly and become pinkish-lilac in colour, which is in contrast with the female American mink, whose organs do not change. In the Moscow Zoo, estrus was observed on 22‚Äì26 April, with copulation lasting from 15 minutes to an hour. The average litter consists of three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about , and grow rapidly, trebling their weight 10 days after birth. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30‚Äì31 days. The lactation period lasts 2.0 to 2.5 months, though the kits eat solid food after 20‚Äì25 days. They accompany the mother on hunting expeditions at the age of 56‚Äì70 days, and become independent at the age 70‚Äì84 days. =Diet= The European mink has a diverse diet consisting largely of aquatic and riparian fauna. Differences between its diet and that of the American mink are small. Voles are the most important food source, closely followed by crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands, with cases being known of European minks catching fish weighing . The European mink's daily food requirement is . In times of food abundance, it caches its food. Range and status The European mink is mostly restricted to Europe. Its range was widespread in the 19th century, with a distribution extending from northern Spain in the west to the river Ob (just east of the Urals) in the east, and from the Archangelsk region in the north to the northern Caucasus in the south. Over the last 150 years, though, it has severely declined by more than 90% and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range. The current range includes an isolated population in northern Spain and western France, which is widely disjunct from the main range in Eastern Europe (Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, central regions of European Russia, the Danube Delta in Romania and northwestern Bulgaria). It occurs from sea level to . In Estonia, efforts have been made to re-establish viable populations on the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. Decline Illustration from Brehms Tierleben The earliest actual records of decreases in European mink numbers occurred in Germany, having already become extinct in several areas by the middle of the 18th century. A similar pattern occurred in Switzerland, with no records of minks being published in the 20th century. Records of minks in Austria stopped by the late 18th century. By the 1930s-1950s, the European mink became extinct in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and possibly Bulgaria. In Finland, the main decline occurred in the 1920s-1950s and the species was thought to be extinct in the 1970s, though a few specimens were reported in the 1990s. In Latvia, the European mink was thought to be extinct for years, until a specimen was captured in 1992. In Lithuania, the last specimens were caught in 1978‚Äì79. The decline of the European mink in Estonia and Belarus was rapid during the 1980s, with only a few small, fragmented populations in the northeastern regions of both countries being reported in the 1990s. The decline of European mink numbers in Ukraine began in the late 1950s, with now only a few small and isolated populations being reported in the upper courses of the Ukrainian Carpathian rivers. Their numbers in Moldova began to drop very quickly in the 1930s, with the last known population having been confined to the lower course of the River Prut on the Romanian border by the late 1980s. In Romania, the European mink was very common and widely distributed, with 8000‚Äì10,000 being captured in 1960. Currently, Romanian mink populations are confined to the Danube Delta. In European Russia, the European mink was common and widespread in the early 20th century, but began to decline during the 1950s-1970s. The core of their range was in the Tver Region, though they began to decline there by the 1990s, which was worsened by a colonisation of the area by the American mink. Between 1981 and 1989, 388 European minks were introduced to two of the Kurile Islands, though by the 1990s, the population there was found to be lower than that originally released. In France and Spain, an isolated range occurs, extending from Brittany to northern Spain. Data from the 1990s indicate the European mink has disappeared from the northern half of this previous range. =Possible reasons for decline= Habitat loss Habitat-related declines of European mink numbers may have started during the Little Ice Age, which was further aggravated by human activity. As the European mink is more dependent on wetland habitats than the American species, its decline in Central Europe, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Moldova and Ukraine has been linked to the drainage of small rivers. In mid-19th-century Germany, for example, European mink populations declined in a decade due to expanded land drainage. Although land improvement and river dredging certainly resulted in population decreases and fragmentation, in areas which still maintain suitable river ecosystems, such as Poland, Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia, Finland and Russia, the decline preceded the change in wetland habitats, and may have been caused by extensive agricultural development. Overhunting The European mink was historically hunted extensively, particularly in Russia, where in some districts, the decline prompted a temporary ban on mink hunting to let the population recover. In the early 20th century, 40‚Äì60,000 European minks were caught annually in the Soviet Union, with a record of 75,000 individuals (an estimate which exceeds the modern global European mink population). In Finland, annual mink catches reached 3000 specimens in the 1920s. In Romania, 10,000 minks were caught annually around 1960. However, this reason alone cannot account for the decline in areas where hunting was less intense, such as in Germany. Decline of crayfish The decline of European crayfish has been proposed as a factor in the drop in mink numbers, as minks are notably absent in the eastern side of the Urals, where crayfish are also absent. The decline in mink numbers has also been linked to the destruction of crayfish in Finland during the 1920s-1940s, when the crustaceans were infected with crayfish plague. The failure of the European mink to expand west to Scandinavia coincides with the gap in crayfish distribution. Competition with the American Mink and disease The American mink was introduced and released in Europe during the 1920s-1930s. The American mink is less dependent on wetland habitats than the European mink and is 20-40% larger. The impact of feral American minks on European mink populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Disease spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Though the presence of the American mink has coincided with the decline of European mink numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline of the European mink in some areas preceded the introduction of the American mink by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though European mink populations in these regions are still declining. Diseases spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Twenty-seven helminth species are recorded to infest the European mink, consisting of 14 trematodes, two cestodes and 11 nematodes. The mink is also vulnerable to pulmonary filariasis, krenzomatiasis and skrjabingylosis. In the Leningrad and Pskov Oblasts, 77.1% of European minks were found to be infected with skrjabingylosis. Hybridisation and competition with the European Polecat In the early 20th century, northern Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with an expansion of the range of the European polecat. The European mink possibly was gradually absorbed by the polecat due to hybridisation. Also, competition with the polecat has greatly increased, due to landscape change favouring the polecat. There is one record of a polecat attacking a mink and dragging it to its burrow. Polecat-mink hybrids are termed khor'-tumak by furriers and khonorik by fanciers. Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where European minks are declining. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. Fairly large, the males attain the peak sizes known for European polecats (weighing and measuring in length), and females are much larger than female European minks (weighing and measuring in length).Sidorovich, V. (2001) Finding on the ecology of hybrids between the European mink Mustela lutreola and polecat M.putorius at the Lovat upper reaches, NE Belarus Small Carnivore Conservation 24: 1-5 The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks. Hybrids can swim well like minks and burrow for food like polecats. They are very difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile, though females are fertile.Tumanov, Igor L. & Abramov, Alexei V. (2002) A study of the hybrids between the European Mink Mustela lutreola and the Polecat M. putorius Small Carnivore Conservation 27: 29-31 The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 by Soviet zoologist Dr. Dmitry Ternovsky of Novosibirsk. Originally bred for their fur (which was more valuable than that of either parent species), the breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate the hybrids will stray from aquatic habitats more readily than pure minks, and will tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid's larger size (especially the male's) may deter intrusion. During the summer period, the diet of wild polecat-mink hybrids is more similar to that of the mink than to the polecat, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During the winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as the polecat does. Predation Predators of the European mink include the European polecat, the American mink, the golden eagle, large owls and the red fox. Red fox numbers have increased greatly in areas where the wolf and Eurasian lynx have been extirpated, as well as areas where modern forestry is practised. As red foxes are known to prey on mustelids, excessive fox predation on the European mink is a possible factor, though it is improbable to have been a factor in Finland, where fox numbers were low during the early 20th century.

It is considered the first cyberpunk-genre MMORPG, and is designed to integrate elements of first- person shooter games. It has been called a MMO first-person shooter (MMOFPS), but most consider it a hybrid of MMORPG and first-person shooter,. Although Neocron is often said to be the first MMOFPS, WWII Online, released in 2001, holds the Guinness World Record as the first MMOFPS. Its 2004 sequel, Neocron 2: Beyond Dome of York, was originally slated to be an expansion pack and released separately under a new publisher, 10tacle Studios AG. Following a brief transitional period where Neocron players were encouraged to transfer their characters to Neocron 2, the Neocron servers were closed while the Neocron 2 servers continue to run to this day.  Character development  The player character may be chosen from four distinct classes. Available are genetically engineered super soldiers, (\\"GenTank\\"), the slight, yet dexterous and intelligent \\"Spy\\", the psionically focused and physically underpowered \\"Psi Monk\\" as well as the \\"Private Eye\\" (PE), commonly referred to as a Jack of All Trades for its ability to use aspects of all the other classes. Later the player may assign \\"skill points\\" (gained from experience) into specific abilities, e.g. Construction, Research, Droning and Rifles. Any character or class can use the most basic forms of these, but to master any one of them requires a large commitment in skill points. Jobs range from the notorious hacker, who dives into the alternate reality of Hacknet, technicians who research or construct items and (especially) weapons, to the common grunt, who fights alongside his clan for the outposts, spread around the wastelands (Jobs are not physically imposed: they are a generalization taken from how skill points are distributed to attributes.)  Storyline  A \\"Subway\\" station in Neocron city The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic 28th century. In the mid-22nd century, tensions rose between an expanded Chinese Empire and a joint European/North American Federation of the Free World. The unexplained apparent destruction of the first Chinese interstellar colony ship resulted in China launching devastating nuclear strikes with stealth missiles. In retaliation, the American president gave the command to counter strike with cold fusion long-range missiles. World War III started on February 17, 2143; it lasted less than 6 hours. It took over three centuries for even the most rudimentary civilization to return. By the mid-26th century two great cities had risen from the ashes, thanks in large part to the \\"Ceres Project‚Äù. Originally an MIT project in the early 21st century aimed at storing every aspect of human knowledge on holodisk, it had been taken over by the American military in response to the murder of the project leader. 500 years later, both cities are now but shadows of their former selves: Neocron is diminished thanks to a succession of coups d'√©tat as well as a mass exodus to Irata III, a colony 80 light years away formed by the missing Chinese colony ship, and Dome of York suffers from losing a devastating war with Neocron.  Reception  Neocron received generally mixed reviews. While some reviewers praised the first- person shooter style interface as \\"intuitive\\" or \\"innovative\\", others describe combat in Neocron as being \\"dull\\" or not at all revolutionary.

The name, meaning \\"nests\\", refers to the tractate's subject matter of errors in bird-offerings. It is the last tractate in the order, because of its shortness (3 chapters) and because it deals with a very rare and unusual area of Jewish law. The premise of the tractate is the obligatory bird-offering that has to be brought by certain people (for instance Nazirites at the completion of their vow and women after childbirth). The offering consists of a pair of birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a peace-offering. A common practice was to purchase a cage with two birds, without designating which one was for which type of sacrifice. The Kohen would then allocate a sacrifice to a bird. However, the complication is that a cage (consisting of a pair of birds) cannot have both birds offered as one type of sacrifice. The result is that if birds become mixed up (whether completely or a number of birds flies from one group to another), certain birds are disqualified from being offered. It is the laws of these complications that form the subject of tractate Kinnim. The tractate consists of three chapters: *Chapter 1 deals largely with cases where birds flew into a designated group or where different groups of birds became totally mixed up. *Chapter 2 considers the group from which a bird flew away, as well as multiple mixups *Chapter 3 considers which sacrifices are counted if the Kohen did offer certain birds, without consulting the laws of chapters 1 and 2. There is no Gemara on Kinnim in either the Talmud Bavli or the Talmud Yerushalmi. However, the Mishnayot of the tractate are included in the Daf Yomi cycle, and are thus printed in the standard editions of the Talmud. A traditional explanation for this has been that the addition of the tractate enabled all the tractates of Kodshim to be studied in the Daf Yomi cycle. In the standard edition, Kinnim is located in a volume which contains Meilah, Kinnim, Tamid and Midot. It occupies folios 22a-25a. Kinnim is considered to be one of the most difficult tractate in the whole Talmud, largely because the mishnayot involve rather elaborate counting methods and practices. These resemble certain forms of counting found in discrete mathematics and, appropriately, make use of the pigeonhole principle. Furthermore, the form of expression in Kinnim is particularly terse, even for the Mishna. This has resulted in a number of commentaries, many of them having very different explanations of the whole tractate. However, it is only the last few mishnayot of the last chapter that have caused the most difficulties.

He was the commandant of the Sobib√≥r and Treblinka extermination camps during the Operation Reinhard phase of the Holocaust. He worked for Volkswagen do Brasil and was arrested in Brazil in 1967, extradited to West Germany and tried for the mass murder of 900,000 people. In 1970, he was found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty, life imprisonment. He died of heart failure six months later.Sobibor - The Forgotten Revolt Early life and Nazi affiliations Stangl was born in 1908 in Altm√ºnster, located in the Salzkammergut region of Austria. He was the son of a night-watchman and had such an emotionally distressing relationship with his father that he was deeply frightened by and hated the sight of the elder Stangl's Habsburg Dragoons uniform.Robert S. Wistrich (1982). Who's Who in Nazi Germany, pp. 295-96. Stangl claimed his father died of malnutrition in 1916. To help support his family, Franz learned to play the zither and earned money giving zither lessons. Stangl completed his public schooling in 1923.Henry Friedlander (1995). The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 204-05; In his teens he secured an apprenticeship as a weaver, qualifying as a master weaver in 1927. Concerned that this trade offered few opportunities for advancement ‚Äì and having observed the poor health of his co-workers ‚Äì Stangl sought a new career. He moved to Innsbruck in 1930 and applied for an appointment in the Austrian federal police. Stangl later suggested that he liked the security and cleanliness that the police uniforms represented to him. He was accepted in early 1931 and trained for two years at the federal police academy in Linz. Stangl became a member of the NSDAP (commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party) in 1931, an illegal association for an Austrian police officer at that time. Post-war, he denied having been a Nazi since 1931 and claimed that he had enrolled as member of the party only to avoid arrest following the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany in May 1938. Records suggest that Stangl contributed to a Nazi aid fund but he disavowed knowing about the intended party purpose of the fund. Stangl had Nazi Party number 6,370,447 and SS number 296,569. In 1935, Stangl was accepted into the Kriminalpolizei as a detective in the Austrian town of Wels. After Austria's Anschluss, Stangl was assigned to the Schutzpolizei (which was taken over by the Gestapo) in Linz, where he was posted to the Jewish Bureau ().Christian Zentner, Friedemann Bed√ºrftig (1991). The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, pp. 910-11. Macmillan, New York; Stangl joined the SS in May 1938. He ultimately reached the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer (Captain).Klee, Ernst: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945?. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2003; T-4 Euthanasia program, 1940-3/1943- After the onset of World War II, in early 1940, Stangl was instructed to report for work at the Public Service Foundation for Institutional Care (Gemeinn√ºtzige Stiftung f√ºr Anstaltspflege), a front organization of the T-4 Euthanasia Program. Stangl purposely solicited for a job in the newly created T-4 program in order to escape difficulties with his boss in the Linz Gestapo. He travelled to the RSHA in Berlin, where he was received by Paul Werner, who offered Stangl a job as supervisor in charge of security at a T-4 facility, and in the language commonly used during recruitment, described Action T4 as a \\"humanitarian\\" effort that was \\"essential, legal, and secret\\". Next Stangl met with Viktor Brack, who offered him a choice of work between Hartheim and Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centres; Stangl picked Hartheim, which was near Linz. Through a direct order from Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler issued in November 1940, Stangl became the deputy office manager (Police Superintendent) of the T-4 Euthanasia Program at Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, and in late summer 1941 at Bernburg Euthanasia Centre, where people with mental and physical disabilities, as well as political prisoners, were sent to be killed. At Hartheim, Stangl served under Christian Wirth as assistant supervisor in charge of security. When Wirth was succeeded by Franz Reichleitner, Stangl stayed on as Reichleitner's deputy. During his brief posting to Bernburg Euthanasia Centre Stangl reorganized the office at that T-4 facility. In March 1942, Stangl was given a choice to either return to the Linz Gestapo or be transferred to Lublin for work in Operation Reinhard. Stangl accepted the posting to Lublin in the General Government, where he would manage Operation Reinhard under Odilo Globoƒçnik. Extermination camps =Sobib√≥r, 4-8/1942= Stangl was appointed by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler to be the first commandant of Sobib√≥r extermination camp. Stangl was Sobib√≥r's commandant from 28 April until the end of August 1942, at the rank of SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer. He claimed that Odilo Globoƒçnik initially suggested that Sobib√≥r was merely a supply camp for the army, and that the true nature of the camp became known to him only when he himself discovered a gas chamber hidden in the woods. Globoƒçnik told him that if the Jews \\"were not working hard enough\\" he was fully permitted to kill them and that Globoƒçnik would send \\"new ones\\". Stangl studied the camp operations and management of Be≈Ç≈ºec, which had already commenced extermination activity. He then accelerated the completion of Sobib√≥r.Christian Zentner, Friedemann Bed√ºrftig. The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 878. Macmillan, New York (1991); Around that time Stangl also had further dealings with Wirth, who was running extermination camps at Be≈Ç≈ºec and Chelmno. Between 16‚Äì18 May 1942, Sobib√≥r became fully operational. However, Stangl quickly realized that the extermination process was being encumbered by constant turnover among its prisoner labor force. He ended arbitrary culling of \\"work Jews\\" and established semi-permanent work teams, each overseen by a kapo. In the three months before Stangl was transferred to Treblinka, Yitzak Arad estimates that approximately 90,000 Jews were killed at Sobibor. Stangl avoided interacting with his victims and he was rarely seen except when he greeted arriving prisoner transports. On these occasions, he stood out because the all-white linen riding coat he would wear, an affectation which earned him the nickname \\"White Death\\". Prisoners who did interact with him regarded as one of the \\"moderates\\" among the camp staff. He was only ever accused of a single act of hands-on violence, and on one occasion he convened a meeting to address what he regarded as Kurt Bolender's \\"bullying\\" of the sonderkommando prisoners working in the extermination area. Stangl took an interest in one prisoner, Shlomo Szmajzner, who was forced to make gold jewelry for the SS officers. After the war, Szmajzner recalled that Stangl as an arrogant man who stood out for \\"his obvious pleasure in his work and his situation. None of the others --although they were, in different ways, so much worse than he-- showed this to such an extent. He had this perpetual smile on his face.\\" Around 100,000 Jews are believed to have been killed there while Stangl was the administrator until the furnaces broke down in October, by which time Stangl had left. Stangl was succeeded as Sobib√≥r commandant by his Hartheim Euthanasia Center colleague, Franz Reichleitner. =Treblinka, 9/1942-8/1943= On 28 August 1942, Odilo Globoƒçnik ordered Stangl to become Kommandant at the newly opened but disorganized death camp, Treblinka, then under the incompetent command of Irmfried Eberl. Globoƒçnik trusted that Stangl could restore order at Treblinka, since Stangl had a reputation as a highly competent administrator and people manager with an excellent grasp of detail.Treblinka Death Camp, with photographs , Ounsdale, PDF (2.2 MB) Stangl assumed command of Treblinka on 1 September 1942. Stangl wanted his camp to look attractive, so he ordered the paths paved and flowers planted along the sides of Seidel Street, near camp headquarters and SS living quarters. Despite being directly responsible for the camp's operations, Stangl said he limited his contact with Jewish prisoners as much as possible. Stangl rarely intervened with unusually cruel acts (other than gassing) perpetrated by his subordinate officers at the camp. He usually wore a white uniform and carried a whip, which caused prisoners to nickname him the \\"White Death\\". He claimed while in prison that his dedication had nothing to do with ideology or hatred of Jews. He said he matter-of-factly viewed the prisoners as material objects rather than people, including their extermination: \\"That was my profession. I enjoyed it. It fulfilled me. And yes, I was ambitious about that, I won't deny it.\\"Yitzhak Arad (1987). Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 184-86. Stangl accepted and grew accustomed to the killings, perceiving prisoners not as humans but merely as \\"cargo\\" that must be destroyed. Stangl accepted the extermination of the Jews as a fact. At about this time, Stangl began drinking heavily. He is quoted as saying: In September 1942, Stangl supervised the building of new, larger gas chambers to augment the existing gas chambers. The new gas chambers became operational in early autumn 1942. It is believed that these death chambers were capable of killing 3,000 people in two hours, and 12,000 to 15,000 victims easily every day, with a maximum capacity of 22,000 deaths in 24 hours.David E. Sumler, A history of Europe in the twentieth century, Dorsey Press; . According to Jankiel Wiernik: \\"When the new gas chambers were completed, the Hauptsturmf√ºhrer [Stangl] came and remarked to the SS men who were with him: 'Finally the Jewish city is ready' ()\\". Erich Bauer later remarked: =Trieste, 8/1943-1945 = In August 1943, along with Globoƒçnik, Stangl was transferred to Trieste, where he helped organize the campaign against Yugoslav partisans and local Jews. Due to illness, he returned to Vienna in early 1945, where he served in the \\"Alpine Fortress\\" (Alpenfestung). Post-war escape, 1945‚Äì1961 At the end of the war, Stangl fled without concealing his name. He was detained by the American Army in 1945 and was briefly imprisoned pending investigation in Linz, Austria in 1947. Stangl was suspected of complicity in the T-4 euthanasia programme. On 30 May 1948, he escaped to Italy with his colleague from Sobib√≥r, SS sergeant Gustav Wagner. Austrian Roman Catholic Bishop Alois Hudal, a Nazi sympathizer, forced in 1952 to resign by the Vatican, helped him to escape through a \\"ratline\\" and to reach Syria using a Red Cross passport.Michael Phayer, The Catholic Church and the Holocaust Stangl was joined by his wife and family and lived in Syria for three years. In 1951, they moved to Brazil. After years of other jobs, he found work at the Volkswagen do Brasil plant in S√£o Bernardo do Campo with the help of friends, still using his own name.Komplizen? ‚Äì VW und die brasilianische Milit√§rdiktatur. DasErste, ARD, 24.07.2017 Arrest, trial and death Although Stangl's role in the mass murder of men, women and children was known to the Austrian authorities, a warrant for his arrest was not issued until 1961. Despite being registered under his real name at the Austrian consulate in S√£o Paulo,Sereny, Gitta Into That Darkness: from Mercy Killing to Mass Murder, a study of Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka (1974) it took another six years before he was tracked down by Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and arrested by Brazilian federal police on 28 February 1967. He never used an assumed name during his escape, and it is not clear why it took so long to apprehend him. After his extradition to West Germany by Brazilian authorities, he was tried for the deaths of around 900,000 people. He admitted to these killings but argued: \\"My conscience is clear. I was simply doing my duty...\\" Stangl's attempt to justify his actions as non-criminal in the face of German law was subsequently quoted by Arad: Philosopher John Kekes discussed Stangl and the degree of his responsibility for war crimes in chapter 4 of his book, The Roots of Evil.Kekes, John. Roots of Evil excerpt via Google.com; accessed 5 March 2017. The Schwurgericht D√ºsseldorf court found Stangl guilty on 22 December 1970 and sentenced him to the maximum penalty, life imprisonment.Klee, Ernst, Dressen, Willi, Riess, Volker The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders; . While in prison, Stangl was interviewed extensively by Gitta Sereny for a study of him which was published under the title Into that Darkness. She wrote, quoting him: In his prison interview with Sereny, she later wrote: > Stangl had pronounced the words 'my guilt': but more than the words, the > finality of it was in the sagging of his body, and on his face. After more > than a minute he started again, a half-hearted attempt, in a dull voice. 'My > guilt,' he said, 'is that I am still here. That is my guilt.'Sereny (1974), > p. 364 He died of heart failure nineteen hours after the conclusion of that interview, in D√ºsseldorf prison on 28 June 1971.

He led the National League in complete games (27), innings pitched (320.1), and shutouts (6) in 1910. His best year was 1911, when he won 22 games for the Dodgers. He holds the Brooklyn Dodgers record for the most shutouts in the National League (38); most strikeouts (16) in a regulation nine-inning game, and the most 1-0 shutouts (3) in a 154-game season. He became strictly a knuckleball pitcher when his speed declined.https://www.psacard.com/autographfacts/baseball/nap-rucker/902 =MLB Hall of Fame= In 1936, Rucker became eligible for the MLB Hall of Fame. As a player who received more than 5.0% of votes cast, Rucker remained eligible for induction by the Baseball Writers' Association of America until 1946, when his time on the ballot expired after 10 unsuccessful appearances. His highest percentage of votes earned came in his final year on the ballot, receiving 6.4% of the vote in 1946. Following his unsuccessful nominations, Yankees Hall of Fame manager, Casey Stengel, said about Rucker, \\"If it hadn't been for Nap, I reckon I wouldn't be manager of the Yankees now. I wouldn't have even stayed in baseball.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/21/archives/nap-rucker-86-ace- southpaw-for-old-rrooklyn-dodgers-dies-excelled.html Later Life: Mayor of Roswell Rucker was born in Crabapple, Georgia. After his baseball career, Rucker went on to a successful business career, and served as mayor of Roswell from 1935 to 1936, and as the city's water commissioner after his mayoral term.

It is often informally called the water rat, though it only superficially resembles a true rat. Water voles have rounder noses than rats, deep brown fur, chubby faces and short fuzzy ears; unlike rats their tails, paws and ears are covered with hair. In the wild, on average, water voles only live about five months. Maximum longevity in captivity is two and a half years.  Appearance  Skull of a European water vole. Natural Resources Wales release nearly a thousand water voles in 2009 Water voles reach in length, plus a tail which is about half the length of the body. Weights reported for adults are variable. It is possible for large, optimal adults to weigh as much as However, these are peak weights. Elsewhere, the mean body mass has been reported as , although this figure includes immature water voles.Saucy, F. (1994). Density dependence in time series of the fossorial form of the water vole, Arvicola terrestris. Oikos, 381-392. The minimum weight to successfully breed as well as to survive winter is reportedly in females and in males.Yavuz, G√ºliz, Erc√ºment √áolak, and Teoman Kankƒ±lƒ±√ß. Investigations on the Ecology of Eurasian Water Vole, Arvicola amphibius (Rodentia: Mammalia) in Ankara Province. Pakistan Journal of Zoology 45.6 (2013): 1599-1605. As a species the mean body mass is claimed as .Morand, S., & Poulin, R. (1998). Density, body mass and parasite species richness of terrestrial mammals. Evolutionary Ecology, 12(6), 717-727. Overall, European water voles are a uniform dark brown colour, with slightly paler coloration on the underside. Their pelage is quite thick and they are furred over their entire body, including their tail, unlike rats. Their dark colour allows them to blend in well in the densely vegetated areas they inhabit.Niethammer, J. 1990. Water Voles (Genus *Arvicola*). Pp. 242-245 in S Parker, ed. Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals, Volume III. NY: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company.  Taxonomy  The binomial applied to the water vole is Arvicola amphibius, it was formerly known by the junior synonym A. terrestris. The confusion stems from the fact that Linnaeus described two species of water vole on the same page of the same work. Those two forms are now universally considered the same species. It has been recognized as A. amphibius (Linnaeus, 1758) because the first source to unite the two forms, which Linnaeus had treated separately, into a single species chose A. amphibius as the valid name. The species is widely known by the synonym A. terrestris which for many decades was treated as the valid name. Some authorities consider the southwestern water vole (Arvicola sapidus) to be the same species, but this is now generally considered distinct.  Range  The water-vole Arvicola amphibius is found in most of Europe, Russia, West Asia and Kazakhstan.  Habitat  Ore Mountains, Germany. In Britain, water voles live in burrows excavated within the banks of rivers, ditches, ponds, and streams. Burrows are normally located adjacent to slow moving, calm water which they seem to prefer. They also live in reed beds where they will weave ball shaped nests above ground if no suitable banks exist in which to burrow. Water voles prefer lush riparian vegetation which provides important cover to conceal animals when they are above ground adjacent to the water body. Areas of heavily grazed and trampled riparian habitats are generally avoided.Strachan, R. and Moorhouse, T. (2006). Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2nd edition). Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford. Water voles may be displaced by the introduction of riparian woodland and scrub as they prefer more open wetland habitats away from tree cover. As well as frequenting typical lowland wetland habitats dominated by rank marginal aquatic vegetation, water voles are also just as at home in areas upland 'peatland' vegetation where they utilize suitable small ditches, rivers, and lochs surrounded by moorland up to 1000 m asl (e.g. northern Scotland).Harris, S. and Yalden, D.W. (2008). Mammals of the British Isles: Handbook, 4th Edition. The Mammal Society. In Europe and Russia, they may venture into woods, fields, and gardens. They live under the snow during the winter. Water voles are currently being reintroduced as a threatened species in Yorkshire, England. In the Massif Central area of France, however, farmers are campaigning for action to be taken against water voles, where plagues of these rodents are causing major damage to crops.  Diet  Water-vole eating. Water voles mainly eat grass and other vegetation near the water, but will also consume fruits, bulbs, twigs, buds, and roots when given the opportunity. In Europe, rich harvest periods can cause water vole \\"plagues\\" to take place, during which the voles eat ravenously, destroying entire fields of grass and leaving the fields full of burrows. Water voles in some parts of England have been shown to occasionally prey on frogs and tadpoles; it has been speculated that this is to make up for a protein deficiency in the voles' diet. Food remains alone are not a reliable indicator of the presence of this species, as other smaller voles can also leave remains of large grasses and rushes.Ryland, K. and Kemp, B (2009). \\"Using field signs to identify water voles - are we getting it wrong?\\", In Practice, Bulletin of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management. 63, March 2009 (pp. 23-25).  Breeding  The mating period lasts from March into late autumn. The female vole's pregnancy lasts for approximately 21 days. Up to 8 baby voles can be born, each weighing around . The young voles open their eyes three days after their birth. They are half the size of a full grown water vole by the time they are weaned.  Behaviour  Water voles are expert swimmers and divers. They do not usually live in large groups. Adult water voles each have their own territories, which they mark with fecal latrines located either near the nest, burrow and favoured water's edge platforms where voles leave or enter the water. Latrines are known to be a good survey indicator of this species, and can be used to gauge abundance of animals.Strachan, R. and Moorhouse, T. (2006). Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2nd edition). Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford. They also scent-mark by using a secretion from their bodies (a flank gland), although this is not normally detectable during a field survey. They may attack if their territory is invaded by another water vole.  Predation  As a large and common microtine rodent, the range of predators faced by the European water vole is extensive. However, many species of predator prefer other rodents, such as Microtus voles and wood mice, due to their greater numerical abundance. Wildcats, red foxes, most species of hawk (especially common buzzards), owl (especially the barn owl, genus Strix, and Eurasian eagle-owl) and falcon (in large numbers by the common kestrel) in their range are among their reported predators. A very large number are also taken by mustelids. Reportedly small Mustela weasels as well as European and introduced American mink may take the largest number of water voles of any predator due in part to aligning habitat preferences.Macdonald, D. W., Sidorovich, V. E., Anisomova, E. I., Sidorovich, N. V., & Johnson, P. J. (2002). The impact of American mink Mustela vison and European mink Mustela lutreola on water voles Arvicola terrestris in Belarus. Ecography, 25(3), 295-302. The rarely checked invasive population of American mink has reportedly caused a decline of water voles in Britain.Jefferies, D. J., Morris, P. A., & Mulleneux, J. E. (1989). An enquiry into the changing status of the water vole Arvicola terrestris in Britain. Mammal Review, 19(3), 111-131.  Conservation  = United Kingdom = The water vole population in the UK has fallen from its estimated pre-1960 level of around 8 million to 2.3 million in 1990 and to 354,000 (other source: 750,000) in 1998. This represents a 90‚Äì95% loss. It is still declining dramatically: the most recent estimate for 2004 is around 220,000. This decline is partly attributed to the American mink, an aggressive predator of the vole, together with unsympathetic farming and watercourse management which destroyed parts of the water vole's habitat. On 26 February 2008, the UK Government announced full legal protection for water voles would be introduced from 6 April 2008. This makes it an offence to disturb, damage or obstruct their breeding places. The water vole is the UK's fastest declining mammal and efforts are under way to protect it and its habitat from further destruction. One aspect of water vole conservation in the UK is focused on non-linear habitats such as reed bed which support extensive networks or metapopulations. Other areas supporting healthy populations of water voles are large conurbations such as Birmingham and London and some upland areas where American mink are scarce. Across the UK the Wildlife Trusts and other organisations are undertaking many practical projects to conserve and restore water vole populations. Water voles have recently returned to Lindow Common nature reserve in Cheshire, after many years of absence. The reserve rangers credit this to conservation management, which included thinning of woodland. In September 2019, the Box Moor Trust reintroducted 177 Water Voles in to the River Bulbourne in Hemel Hempstead as part of a three year plan. There is an existing population in nearby Sarratt, and it is hoped that in time the two groups will breed. Wetlands West (formerly the Severn and Avon Vales Wetlands Partnership) reports on work done as part of the Water Vole Recovery Project in the Berkeley Vale. In Gloucestershire a new nature reserve for water voles was created in 2009/2010 at Nind (a former trout farm). Glasgow has recently been identified as a stronghold for water voles, including a distinct population of 'fossorial' water voles, which have been reported as inhabiting brownfield sites, road verges and urban parks. The European Otter has been known to attack mink preying upon water vole. There are also indications that the water vole is increasing in numbers in UK areas where the European otter has made a return.  National Water-Vole Monitoring Programme (NWVMP)  In 2015, People's Trust for Endangered Species launched a new project to try and coordinate conservation efforts for the water-vole in the UK. The National Water-Vole Monitoring Programme (NWVMP) is the first ongoing monitoring scheme for this species in the UK and aims to bring together data from several hundred sites to allow the status of this animal to be assessed year-on-year.  Literary appearances  A water-vole named \\"Ratty\\" is a leading character in the 1908 children's book The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame: the locality used in the book is believed to be Moor Copse in Berkshire, England, and the character's name \\"Ratty\\" has become widely associated with the species and their riverbank habitat, as well as the misconception that they are a species of rat. In the comic novel and film Cold Comfort Farm by Stella Gibbons, one of the characters, Urk, refers to the subject of his unrequited love, Elfine Starkadder, as his little water-vole. Throughout the story, Urk spends a lot of time talking to the water-voles on the farm. C. S.

His crowning achievement, ' (Lover of the Ursa Major or Lover of the Greater Bear) published in 1937, was the third most popular novel in the Second Polish Republic. Following World War II, Piasecki's books were banned by communist censorship in the People's Republic of Poland. After the collapse of the Soviet empire, in early 1990s, Kochanek Wielkiej Nied≈∫wiedzicy became again one of the best selling books in the country according to Rzeczpospolita daily. Another one of his novels, an anti-Soviet satire ' (The Memoirs of a Red Army Officer), had already been reprinted several times.Tomasz Brzustowski, \\"≈öwiƒôci i ≈Åotry.\\" Relacje No. 11/2003, pp. 10 - 11; and, Nasza Polska Life Sergiusz Piasecki was born on April 1, 1901 (or June 1, 1899) in Lyakhavichy, then in Northwestern Krai of the Russian Empire (now Brest Province, Belarus). The latter date was presented by Piasecki on several occasions, probably because he deliberately wanted to mislead the authorities. He was an illegitimate son of a russified Polish nobleman Michal Piasecki and a Belarusian mother Klaudia Kukalowicz, a servant working for the Piasecki family, whom Sergiusz never met. According to his own life story, he was looked after by stepmother Filomena Gruszewska, a devout Catholic, who openly disliked him. His childhood was very difficult also, because children at school mocked his Polish roots, calling him \\"Lach\\" (which, in loose translation, is the Russian equivalent of the ethnic slur Polack). Conversely, Piasecki hated the Russian school ‚Äì as he later explained ‚Äì and in the seventh grade, armed with a pistol attacked the teacher. Sentenced to jail, he escaped while in prison, and thus his formal education ended.Andrzej Rafa≈Ç Potocki, \\"Stoczony do poziomu literata. Sergiusz Piasecki.\\" ≈ªycie 14 April 2001. In the monograph about his life, work and legend,Krzysztof Polecho≈Ñski, ≈ªywot cz≈Çowieka uzbrojonego. Biografia, tw√≥rczo≈õƒá i legenda literacka Sergiusza Piaseckiego. PWN, October 2000, researcher Krzysztof Polecho≈Ñski noted that most available data about Piasecki's whereabouts often do not correspond to reality, not to mention the claims made by the writer himself. Perhaps the discrepancies came from his work as intelligence agent, but there is no way to confirm many of his personal stories. Piasecki's addresses in Vilnius are not available and neither are the registers of houses in which he lived. His personal documents in possession of Piasecki's son: such as the copy of a marriage certificate with Jadwiga Waszkiewicz or the birth certificate of his son W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tomaszewicz are falsifications, as revealed by Polecho≈Ñski himself after a search performed in Vilnius archives. It is not possible to say whether his evacuation card is authentic. There is no photo of him in the prisoners' photo archives of ≈Åukiszki penitentiary. There is no proof of his residency amongst the Vilnius city dwellers. He might have stayed in a hotel. Self-generated legend S≈Çawomir Andruszkiewicz noted, that Piasecki boasted in \\"The Tower of Babel\\" about his many false papers, thus making it difficult even for himself to pull out the correct one every time. The researchers are unable to prove any of his family names, surnames and pseudonyms used during the war. It is impossible to explain, said Andruszkiewicz, why so many of his official statements contain made up facts. It is not known what underground organizations Piasecki belonged to as there is no proof of any. According to his autobiographical writing, at the time of the Bolshevik takeover of Russia in November 1917, Piasecki at age sixteen, found himself in Moscow. He saw with his own eyes the barbarity of the Bolshevik revolution, and from then on, became an avid anti-Communist. Some time in 1918 or 1919, he returned to Belarus, joining the Belarusian anti-Soviet units called Zialony Dub (\\"Green Oak\\"), led by ataman Wiaczeslaw Adamowicz. When in 1919 Polish Army troops captured Minsk in the , Adamowicz decided to cooperate with them. Thus, a Belarusian unit under Polish command was created, and soon Piasecki was transferred to Warsaw's school of infantry cadets. In the summer of 1920, Piasecki fought in the Battle of Radzymin, and this experience tied him with Poland for the rest of his life. Afterwards, he was asked to join Polish intelligence, as his language skills (he spoke Russian and Belarusian fluently) were highly regarded.Alwida A. Bajor, \\"Na tropach bohater√≥w powie≈õci J√≥zefa Mackiewicza. Nazywa≈Ç siƒô Sergiusz Piasecki.\\" Magazyn Wile≈Ñski. Pismo Polak√≥w na Litwie. Since 1990. =Work for the Polish intelligence service= In early 1920s, Piasecki skillfully organized whole web of Polish agents, covering the area of Soviet Belarus. His supervisors were very pleased with his work, but they did not have enough money to cover all expenses incurred by Piasecki and the growing number of his men. So, the enterprising agent found another source of income ‚Äì smuggling. Moreover, this was not only about the money. Foreign spies as a rule were all executed by the Soviets, while smugglers were only incarcerated for a few years. As he wrote ‚Äì he smuggled cocaine to the USSR, taking furs back to Poland. This provided him with a fortune, but Piasecki did not keep the money to himself. He needed it to bribe the Soviet prison guards, as his men were frequently caught and incarcerated. These events were later described by him in '. In February 1926 Piasecki was fired from the Polish intelligence. It is not clear why this happened. Allegedly, he discovered connections between Soviets and some Polish V.I.P.'s. Also, he was at odds with his fellow smugglers. Destitute, he found himself in a desperate situation. All that he possessed was a revolver. In late July 1926, Piasecki was wandering in the forests south of Wilno. Armed, he decided to rob two Jews, Jodel Boryszanski and Morduch Drazlin, who were crossing the forest in a cart. He stole from them 1,054 zlotys, a gold watch and other items. Later, it was established that Piasecki was under the influence of cocaine, and he needed the money to cover bail for his friend, Antoni Niewiarowicz. A few days later, Piasecki and Niewiarowicz robbed a suburban train near Wilno, and, due to Niewiarowicz's lover's confession, they were caught, tried and put in jail in Lida. As his trial took place in the border area, the Lida court was merciless and sentenced Piasecki to death. Fortunately, his former supervisors from the intelligence did not forget about their agent, and so instead of being executed, Piasecki ended up with 15 years imprisonment. His stay in the Lida prison was short. As a leader of a rebellion, he was moved to Rawicz. There, he incited another riot, and was moved to Koronowo and later to Wronki. Finally, Piasecki was transferred to the hardest prison in Poland, located in ≈Åysa G√≥ra near Kielce. As he was regarded a troublesome prisoner, he was often kept in isolation ward, where he got sick with tuberculosis. =Writing in prison= Piasecki became a writer by chance. Later, he confessed that many prisoners in Wronki would write, so he decided to emulate them. As his knowledge of standard Polish was poor, he would learn from a school book of Polish grammar. Some time in either 1935 or 1936, his prison prose came to the attention of a famous novelist and journalist, Melchior Wa≈Ñkowicz, who toured Polish prisons as a reporter. After reading a manuscript of ', Wa≈Ñkowicz encouraged Piasecki to continue his writing efforts and helped him to publish the book. The publication and resulting popularity of the book became the catalyst for getting Piasecki out of prison. The book was published while Piasecki was still in prison, and its copy was delivered to his cell. The book sold out within a month, it was the third most popular publication of interwar Poland. Due to popularity of the book, Wa≈Ñkowicz's efforts to release Piasecki were supported by other writers and lawyers. Finally, in 1937 president Ignacy Mo≈õcicki pardoned him. The day of his release was sensational, crowds of journalists were waiting at a gate, and Piasecki himself was shocked at technical novelties, such as radio, which had become common since 1926. In late 1937 and early 1938, Piasecki went to Otwock and Zakopane, to recuperate. Among others, he met Witkacy (Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz), who painted his portrait. Being a celebrity, he avoided meeting with numerous readers, neither did he like signing of books. World War II activities In the summer of 1939 Piasecki went to Wilno where he stayed during the invasion of Poland in World War II. In September 1939, he volunteered to the Border Defence Corps, to fight the Soviets. During the occupation of Poland, he was offered a chance to move to France, but refused and decided to stay in his occupied homeland. Even though he had never been a member of the Home Army (he said he worked for its executive branch No 2, which ‚Äì like many of his stories ‚Äì was never confirmed),S≈Çawomir Andruszkiewicz, Sergiusza Piaseckiego droga do ‚ÄûWie≈ºy Babel.‚Äù Nasz Czas. he had cooperated with the Polish resistance, and in 1943 became an executioner, carrying out capital punishment sentences handed down by underground Polish courts. His wartime noms de guerre were \\"Sucz\\", \\"Kira\\" and \\"Konrad\\". Later, he wrote two books about his war activities. These are ' (The Tower of Babel) and ' (Adam and Eve). Among those who he was ordered to execute, was J√≥zef Mackiewicz, falsely accused of cooperating with the Germans. However, Piasecki refused to kill him, and later it was revealed that Mackiewicz's accusations had been made up by the Soviets. Living in exile After the war, Piasecki hid from the secret police for a year inside Poland. In April 1946, he escaped to Italy, where he spotted the Italian translation of his own '. Soon, he got in touch with Polish writers living in exile, including Jerzy Giedroyc. In 1947, Piasecki moved to England, his name can be found on a resolution of Union of Polish Writers in Exile, which urged all concerned to stop publishing in the Communist-occupied country. He once publicly declared that he would gladly take any job that would result in erasing Communism. Living abroad, Piasecki did not stop writing. In late 1940s he came to the conclusion that humor was the best weapon to fight the Communists. So, he wrote a satire The memoirs of a Red Army officer, which presents a made-up diary of Mishka Zubov - an officer of the Red Army, who, together with his unit enters Poland on September 17, 1939. Zubov claims in his \\"diary\\" that his only purpose is to kill all the bourgeoisie who possess watches and bicycles. Piasecki became fluent in English as an adult. Sergiusz Piasecki died in 1964 in London at the age of 65. On his tomb, located in Hastings Cemetery, England, it is said that he was born on June 1, 1899.

It is made by Parallax, Inc. and has been popular with electronics hobbyists since the early 1990s. Technical specifications Although the BASIC Stamp 2 has the form of a 24 pin DIP chip, it is in fact a small printed circuit board (PCB) that contains the essential elements of a microprocessor system:BASIC Stamp 2 Microcontroller Module; Parallax. * A Microcontroller containing the CPU, a built in ROM containing the BASIC interpreter, and various peripherals * 2kB of i¬≤C EEPROM memory. * A clock, in the form of a ceramic resonator * Voltage regulator * External input/output The end result is that a hobbyist can connect a 9 V battery to a BASIC Stamp and have a complete system. A serial connection to a personal computer allows the programmer to download software to the BASIC Stamp, which is stored in the onboard non-volatile memory device: it remains programmed until it is erased or reprogrammed, even when the power of the stamp is removed. If the power is reconnected the stamp immediately starts executing the program in slot 0 (of 8, numbered 0..7). Programming The BASIC Stamp is programmed in a variant of the BASIC language, called PBASIC. PBASIC incorporates common microcontroller functions, including PWM, serial communications, I¬≤C and 1-Wire communications, communications with common LCD driver circuits, hobby servo pulse trains, pseudo-sine wave frequencies, and the ability to time an RC circuit which may be used to detect an analog value. Once a program has been written in the 'Stamp Editor', an integrated development environment (IDE) in Windows, the syntax can be checked, tokenized and sent to the chip through a serial/USB Mini-B cable, where it will run. Versions The BASIC Stamp 2 There are currently four variants of the interpreter: # (1992) BASIC Stamp 1 (BS1) # (1995) BASIC Stamp 2 (BS2), with six sub-variants: ## BS2e ## BS2sx ## BS2p24 ## BS2p40 ## BS2pe ## BS2px # (2002) Javelin Stamp # (2006) Propeller\\\\Spin Stamp The BS2 sub- variants feature more memory, higher execution speed, additional specialized PBASIC commands, extra I/O pins, etc., in comparison to the original BS2 model. While the BS1 and BS2 use a PIC, the remaining BASIC Stamp 2 variants use a Parallax SX processor. The third variant is the Javelin Stamp. This module uses a subset of Sun Microsystems' Java programming language instead of Parallax's PBASIC. It does not include any networking facilities. The fourth variant is the Spin Stamp. The module is based on the Parallax Propeller and therefore uses the SPIN programming language instead of PBASIC. A number of companies now make \\"clones\\" of the BASIC Stamp with additional features, such as faster execution, analog-to-digital converters and hardware-based PWM which can run in the background. The Parallax Propeller is gradually accumulating software libraries which give it functionality similar to the BASIC Stamp; however, there is no uniform list of which PBASIC facilities now have Spin equivalents.

A few ophiuroid species can even tolerate brackish water, an ability otherwise almost unknown among echinoderms. A brittle star's skeleton is made up of embedded ossicles. Anatomy Asteriacites, a trace fossil of an ophiuroid; Carmel Formation (Middle Jurassic), near Gunlock, Utah; scale bar is 10 mm. Of all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea may have the strongest tendency toward five-segment radial (pentaradial) symmetry. The body outline is similar to that of starfish, in that ophiuroids have five arms joined to a central body disk. However, in ophiuroids, the central body disk is sharply marked off from the arms. The disk contains all of the viscera. That is, the internal organs of digestion and reproduction never enter the arms, as they do in the Asteroidea. The underside of the disk contains the mouth, which has five toothed jaws formed from skeletal plates. The madreporite is usually located within one of the jaw plates, and not on the upper side of the animal as it is in starfish. The ophiuroid coelom is strongly reduced, particularly in comparison to other echinoderms. Green brittle star - Ophiarachna incrassata =Water-vascular system= The vessels of the water vascular system end in tube feet. The water vascular system generally has one madreporite. Others, such as certain Euryalina, have one per arm on the aboral surface. Still other forms have no madreporite at all. Suckers and ampullae are absent from the tube feet. =Nervous system= The nervous system consists of a main nerve ring which runs around the central disk. At the base of each arm, the ring attaches to a radial nerve which runs to the end of the limb. The nerves in each limb run through a canal at the base of the vertebral ossicles. Most ophiuroids have no eyes, or other specialised sense organs. However, they have several types of sensitive nerve endings in their epidermis, and are able to sense chemicals in the water, touch, and even the presence or absence of light. Moreover, tube feet may sense light as well as odors. These are especially found at the ends of their arms, detecting light and retreating into crevices. =Digestion= The mouth is rimmed with five jaws, and serves as an anus (egestion) as well as a mouth (ingestion). Behind the jaws is a short esophagus and a stomach cavity which occupies much of the dorsal half of the disk.. Digestion occurs within 10 pouches or infolds of the stomach, which are essentially ceca, but unlike in sea stars, almost never extend into the arms. The stomach wall contains glandular hepatic cells. Ophiuroids are generally scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Basket stars in particular may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents. In basket stars, the arms are used to rhythmically sweep food to the mouth. Pectinura consumes beech pollen in the New Zealand fjords (since those trees hang over the water). Eurylina clings to coral branches to browse on the polyps. =Respiration= Gas exchange and excretion occur through cilia-lined sacs called bursae; each opens between the arm bases on the underside of the disk. Typically ten bursae are found, and each fits between two stomach digestive pouches. Water flows through the bursae by means of cilia or muscular contraction. Oxygen is transported through the body by the hemal system, a series of sinuses and vessels distinct from the water vascular system. The bursae are probably also the main organs of excretion, with phagocytic \\"coelomocytes\\" collecting waste products in the body cavity and then migrating to the bursae for expulsion from the body. =Musculoskeletal system= A field of the soft coral Callogorgia sp. with its brittle star symbionts Like all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea possess a skeleton of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite. In ophiuroids, the calcite ossicles are fused to form armor plates which are known collectively as the test. The plates are covered by the epidermis, which consists of a smooth syncytium. In most species, the joints between the ossicles and superficial plates allow the arm to bend to the side, but not to bend upwards. However, in the basket stars, the arms are flexible in all directions. Both the Ophiurida and Euryalida (the basket stars) have five long, slender, flexible, whip-like arms, up to 60 cm in length. They are supported by an internal skeleton of calcium carbonate plates referred to as vertebral ossicles. These \\"vertebrae\\" articulate by means of ball-in-socket joints, and are controlled by muscles. They are essentially fused plates which correspond to the parallel ambulacral plates in sea stars and five Paleozoic families of ophiuroids. In modern forms, the vertebrae occur along the median of the arm. The ossicles are surrounded by a relatively thin ring of soft tissue, and then by four series of jointed plates, one each on the upper, lower, and lateral surfaces of the arm. The two lateral plates often have a number of elongated spines projecting outwards; these help to provide traction against the substrate while the animal is moving. The spines, in ophiuroids, compose a rigid border to the arm edges, whereas in euryalids they are transformed into downward-facing clubs or hooklets. Euryalids are similar to ophiurids, if larger, but their arms are forked and branched. Ophiuroid podia generally function as sensory organs. They are not usually used for feeding, as in Asteroidea. In the Paleozoic era, brittle stars had open ambulacral grooves, but in modern forms, these are turned inward. In living ophiuroids, the vertebrae are linked by well-structured longitudinal muscles. Ophiuroida move horizontally, and Euryalina species move vertically. The latter have bigger vertebrae and smaller muscles. They are less spasmodic, but can coil their arms around objects, holding even after death. These movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, separating them. Ophiuroida move quickly when disturbed. One arm presses ahead, whereas the other four act as two pairs of opposite levers, thrusting the body in a series of rapid jerks. Although adults do not use their tube feet for locomotion, very young stages use them as stilts and even serve as an adhesive structure. Reproduction The sexes are separate in most species, though a few are hermaphroditic or protandric. The gonads are located in the disk, and open into pouches between the arms, called genital bursae. Fertilisation is external in most species, with the gametes being shed into the surrounding water through the bursal sacs. An exception is the Ophiocanopidae, in which the gonads do not open into bursae and are instead paired in a chain along the basal arm joints. Many species brood developing larvae in the bursae, effectively giving birth to live young. A few, such as Amphipholus squamata, are truly viviparous, with the embryo receiving nourishment from the mother through the wall of the bursa. However, some species do not brood their young, and instead have a free-swimming larval stage. Referred to as an ophiopluteus, these larvae have four pairs of rigid arms lined with cilia. They develop directly into an adult, without the attachment stage found in most starfish larvae. The number of species exhibiting ophiopluteus larvae are fewer than those that directly develop. In a few species, the female carries a dwarf male, clinging to it with the mouth. =Fission= Some brittle stars, such as the six-armed members of the family Ophiactidae, exhibit fissiparity (division through fission), with the disk splitting in half. Regrowth of both the lost part of the disk and the arms occur which yields an animal with three large arms and three small arms during the period of growth. The West Indian brittle star, Ophiocomella ophiactoides, frequently undergoes asexual reproduction by fission of the disk with subsequent regeneration of the arms. In both summer and winter, large numbers of individuals with three long arms and three short arms can be found. Other individuals have half a disk and only three arms. A study of the age range of the population indicates little recruitment and fission is the primary means of reproduction in this species. In this species, fission appears to start with the softening of one side of the disk and the initiation of a furrow. This deepens and widens until it extends across the disk and the animal splits in two. New arms begin to grow before the fission is complete, thus minimizing the time between possible successive divisions. The plane of fission varies so that some newly formed individuals have existing arms of different lengths. The time period between successive divisions is 89 days, so theoretically, each brittle star can produce 15 new individuals during the course of a year. =Life span= Brittle stars generally sexually mature in two to three years, become full grown in three to four years, and live up to 5 years. Members of Euryalina, such as Gorgonocephalus, may live much longer. =Regeneration= An Ophiothrix fragilis brittle star with missing arm segments from P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal Ophiuroids can readily regenerate lost arms or arm segments unless all arms are lost. Ophiuroids use this ability to escape predators, in a way similar to lizards which deliberately shed the distal part of their tails to confuse pursuers. Moreover, the Amphiuridae can regenerate gut and gonad fragments lost along with the arms. Discarded arms have not been shown to have the ability to regenerate. Micro brittle starfish and Caulerpa racemosa Locomotion Brittle stars use their arms for locomotion. Brittle stars move fairly rapidly by wriggling their arms which are highly flexible and enable the animals to make either snake-like or rowing movements. However, they tend to attach themselves to the sea floor or to sponges or cnidarians, such as coral. They move as if they were bilaterally symmetrical, with an arbitrary leg selected as the symmetry axis and the other four used in propulsion. The axial leg may be facing or trailing the direction of motion, and due to the radially symmetrical nervous system, can be changed whenever a change in direction is necessary. Brittle star in motion Bioluminescence Over 60 species of brittle stars are known to be bioluminescent. Most of these produce light in the green wavelengths, although a few blue-emitting species have also been discovered. Both shallow-water and deep-sea species of brittle stars are known to produce light. Presumably, this light is used to deter predators. Ecology Brittle stars live in areas from the low-tide level downwards. Six families live at least 2 m deep; the genera Ophiura, Amphiophiura, and Ophiacantha range below 4 m. Shallow species live among sponges, stones, or coral, or under the sand or mud, with only their arms protruding. Two of the best-known shallow species are the green brittle star (Ophioderma brevispina), found from Massachusetts to Brazil, and the common European brittle star (Ophiothrix fragilis). Deep-water species tend to live in or on the sea floor or adhere to coral, urchins, or xenophyophores. The most widespread species is the long-armed brittle star (Amphipholis squamata), a grayish or bluish, strongly luminescent species. =Parasites= The main parasite to enter the digestive tract or genitals are protozoans. Crustaceans, nematodes, trematodes, and polychaete annelids also serve as parasites. Algal parasites such as Coccomyxa ophiurae cause spinal malformation. Unlike in sea stars and sea urchins, annelids are not typical parasites.  Diversity and taxonomy  Plate of brittle stars from the Kunstformen der Natur from Ernst Haeckel (1904) Second plate of brittle stars from Haeckel Between and species of brittle stars are currently known, but the total number of modern species may be over . This makes brittle stars the most abundant group of current echinoderms (before sea stars). Around 270 genera are known, these are distributed in 16 families, which makes them at the same time a relatively poorly diversified group structurally, compared with the other echinoderms. For example, 467 species belong to the sole family of Amphiuridae (frail brittle stars which live buried in the sediment leaving only their arms in the stream to capture the plankton). There are also 344 species in the family of Ophiuridae.

Study of past distribution and evolution of brittle stars has been hampered by the tendency of dead brittle stars to disarticulate and scatter, providing poor fossils. Until discoveries in the Agrio Formation of Neuqu√©n Basin in the 2010s no fossil brittle star was known in the Southern Hemisphere, nor was any brittle star of Cretaceous age known. Human relations Reunion island. Brittle stars are not used as food, though they are not toxic, because of their strong skeleton. Even if some species have blunt spines, no brittlestar is known to be dangerous, nor venomous. There is no harm evidence towards humans, and even with their predators, brittlestars' only mean of defense is escaping or discarding an arm. =Aquaria= Brittle stars are a moderately popular invertebrate in fishkeeping. They can easily thrive in marine tanks; in fact, the micro brittle star is a common \\"hitchhiker\\" that will propagate and become common in almost any saltwater tank, if one happens to come along on some live rock. Larger brittle stars are popular because, unlike Asteroidea, they are not generally seen as a threat to coral, and are also faster-moving and more active than their more archetypical cousins.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball, most notably as a member of the Chicago White Sox with whom he won a World Series championship in 1906. Although he was a relatively weak hitter, he sustained a sixteen-year playing career by being one of the best defensive catchers of his era.* Sullivan's reputation as a defensive standout is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs. He had to catch every type of pitch imaginable, such as shine balls, spitballs, knuckleballs, and emory balls. Early life William Joseph Sullivan was born on February 1, 1875 in the town of Oakland, Wisconsin, to Irish immigrant farmers. He attended Fort Atkinson High School, where he played mainly as an infielder until their regular catcher could not play due to an injury. Sullivan substituted and excelled; so much so that he began being scouted by a local amateur team. After his graduation from high school, Sullivan played for an independent team located in Edgewater, Wisconsin. He played on his first professional team in 1896 for the Cedar Rapids Bunnies of the Western Association, a Class-B minor league. He stayed in the Western Association for the 1897 season, playing for the Dubuque, Iowa representative. In 124 games played that season, he batted just .216, but did hit seven home runs and stole 27 bases. Sullivan then transferred to the Class-A Western League in 1898 to play for the Columbus Buckeyes, also referred to as the Senators, and had a .276 batting average in 68 games played. He stayed with the Buckeyes to begin the 1899 season, though he later moved with the team to Grand Rapids, Michigan; they then became known as the Furniture Makers. He was hitting .306 after 83 games when he was sold to the Boston Beaneaters of the National League for $1000. Major-league career Sullivan made his major league debut with the Beaneaters on September 13, 1899 at the age of 24, and became their regular catcher, appearing in 22 games the rest of season. On September 27, against the Washington Senators, he hit his first major league home run; a three-run home run in the bottom of the fifth inning off of Bill Magee. In 1900, Sullivan hit 8 home runs, the fifth highest total in the National League. Sullivan then joined the Chicago White Sox of the American League in 1901. He played as catcher in the American League's first game as a major league, an 8-2 Chicago victory over Cleveland on April 24, 1901. He helped guide the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average in the league as they went on to win the American League championship. Sullivan's pitch-calling skills were evident in 1904 as the White Sox led the league with 26 shutouts. He caught for two twenty-game winning pitchers in 1905, with Nick Altrock winning 23 games and Frank Owen winning 21 games. Frank Smith added 19 wins and Doc White provided another 17 victories as the White Sox once again led the league in earned run average. The team battled the Philadelphia Athletics in a tight pennant race and were tied for first place with 11 games left in the season before faltering to finish the season in second place. Sullivan as a member of the Chicago White Sox, circa 1906‚Äì1911. Sullivan was a member of the 1906 White Sox team that became known as the Hitless Wonders when they won the American League pennant despite posting the lowest team batting average in the league. The team had been in fourth place by the end of July, games behind the defending champion Athletics, when they went on a 19-game winning streak that drove them into first place. No American League team would surpass the 19-game winning streak for almost 100 years until the 2002 Oakland Athletics won 20 consecutive games.Great Baseball Feats, Facts and Figures, 2008 Edition, p. 377, David Nemec and Scott Flatow, A Signet Book, Penguin Group, New York, The team made up for their lack of hitting prowess by leading the league in walks, hit batsmen and sacrifice hits. Sullivan tied for the team lead in home runs with two. He led American League catchers in baserunners caught stealing, finished second in putouts and assists and guided the White Sox pitching staff to a league-leading 32 shutouts and the second lowest earned run average in the league. The White Sox then defeated their cross-town rivals, the heavily favored Chicago Cubs in the 1906 World Series. Sullivan was literally hitless for the \\"Hitless Wonders,\\" going 0-for-21 at the plate in the Series. In 1907, Sullivan caught for three twenty-game winning pitchers, as Doc White won 27 games, Ed Walsh won 24 games and Frank Smith won 23 games. The White Sox once again led the league in earned run average, however, they fell to third in the season standings. Sullivan's catching credentials were embellished by his association with future Baseball Hall of Fame member, Walsh, who would win 40 games in 1908, as the White Sox once again led the league in shutouts. The White Sox were in contention until losing the final game of the season to the eventual American League champions, the Detroit Tigers. He served as a player- manager for the White Sox in 1909, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish. The following season, Hugh Duffy took over as manager and Sullivan returned to catching. Sullivan was the White Sox catcher on July 1, 1910, when the team inaugurated their new stadium, Comiskey Park, named after the team owner, Charles Comiskey. On August 24, 1910, Sullivan caught three baseballs thrown by Ed Walsh from a window at the top of the Washington Monument as a publicity stunt, matching the feat by Washington catcher Gabby Street two years earlier. By 1912, the 37-year-old Sullivan's performance began to decline as future Hall of Fame member, Ray Schalk, emerged as his successor. He spent the 1913 and 1914 seasons as a coach, tutoring Schalk before being given his unconditional release on February 15, 1915. Sullivan returned to the minor leagues in 1915, playing one season for the Minneapolis Millers, helping them win the American Association pennant. He rejoined the major leagues in 1916, appearing in one game with the Detroit Tigers, before retiring as a player at the age of 41. While Sullivan was not a very good hitter, it was his performance as a fielder that garnered him high praise from his peers. Ty Cobb, Hall of Fame outfielder of the Detroit Tigers and former all-time major league leader in stolen bases, once described him as the hardest catcher on which to attempt a steal. Career statistics In a sixteen-year major league career, Sullivan played in 1,147 games, accumulating 777 hits in 3,647 at bats for a .213 career batting average along with 21 home runs, 378 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .254. He led American League catchers three times in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .976 average, which was 12 points above the league average during his playing career. Sullivan also led American League catchers twice in baserunners caught stealing and caught stealing percentage, and once in assists. His 952 baserunners caught stealing ranks him 11th on the all-time list for major league catchers. Sullivan also ranks 11th overall among major league catchers in shutouts caught during his career. He was also durable, leading league catchers in games played three times, while consistently within the top three most of his career. Later life After his retirement from baseball, the Jefferson County, Wisconsin native retired in Newberg, Oregon where he farmed twenty acres of land and became the president of a local fruit growers' association. Upon the occasion of his induction into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1956, Sullivan was presented with a plaque at the Milwaukee County Stadium. He died of a heart ailment on January 28, 1965 at the age of 89. Although news reports at the time of Sullivan's death credited him as the inventor of the catcher's chest protector, this was disputed by author Peter Morris in his book, Catcher, in which he states that catchers first began using chest protectors during the 1880s. Sullivan did however, receive a United States patent in 1908 for an inflatable, contoured chest protector, which protected his body better and, thanks to hinging, allowed more freedom of movement than the normal model. His son, Billy Sullivan, Jr., also became a major league catcher. When Billy Sullivan Jr. caught for the Detroit Tigers in the 1940 World Series, the Sullivans became the first father and son to have played in the World Series.

Leese was initially prominent as a veterinary expert on camels. A virulent anti-Semite, he led his own fascist movement, the Imperial Fascist League, and was a prolific author and publisher of polemics both before and after the Second World War. Early life and education Leese was born on 16 November 1878 in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, England, the son of Spencer Leese, a manufacturer and artist. He was a nephew of Sir Joseph Francis Leese, 1st Baronet (1845‚Äì1914),Thomas Linehan, British Fascism, 1918-39: Parties, Ideology and Culture, Manchester University Press, 2000, , p. 71 and a second cousin of Sir Oliver Reese, 3rd Baronet (1894‚Äì1978). Leese was educated at Giggleswick School.1891 Census for Giggleswick Grammar School RG12/3493 An only child, his childhood was characterised by loneliness. The death of his father when he was a teenager let the family with financial difficulties, forcing Leese to leave boarding school. He nonetheless attended the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons thanks to the financial help of his grandfather.  Veterinary career  After graduating in 1903, Leese first worked as an equine clinician in London, then accepted a post at the Civil Veterinary Department in India in 1907, where he became an expert on the camel. He worked in India for six years, largely along the North-West Frontier, then was transferred to Italian Somaliland to work for the East Africa Government's veterinary department, where he was posted at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Leese was recognised as a leading authority on the camel and published several articles on the camel and its maladies, the first appearing in The Journal of Tropical Veterinary Science in 1909. A camel parasite, Thelazia leesei was named after him by Louis-Joseph Alcide Railliet in 1910.The Journal of Tropical Veterinary Science, January 1910 issue, Volume V, No. 1, page 92 In 1927 he published A Treatise on the One-Humped Camel in Health and in Disease, which would remain a standard work in India for fifty years. During the First World War, Leese was commissioned in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps,London Gazette Issue 29408 published on the 17 December 1915, page 5 then served as a Camel Purchase Officer to the Somaliland Remount Commission with the Camel Corps, and in France on the Western Front as a Veterinary Officer for the Advanced Horse Transport Depot. During the war, he married May Winifred King, the daughter of his former landlord. Leese returned to England and settled in Stamford, Lincolnshire, practising as a vet until retirement in June 1928. Fascist activist In the early 1920s, Leese became interested in Italian fascism and developed a fascination for the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. In April 1923 he wrote a short pamphlet, Fascism for Old England, praising the Duce and highlighting the \\"significance of fascism for Britain\\". He joined the British Fascists (BF) soon after its creation in May 1923, establishing his own branch in Stamford in March 1924, which soon gained 80 members. Leese despised however the BF policy of allowing former socialists and Jews in the party, contending that it was \\"honeycombed\\" with communist infiltrators. He further wrote that the BF \\"did not understand Fascism at all\\", the true nature of which was to Leese a \\"revolt against democracy and a return to statesmanship\\". An animal lover, he also claimed that the style of slaughter practised in Judaism influenced his anti-semitism. Leese joined the Centre International d'√âtudes sur la Fascisme (CINEF), an international 'think tank' based in Switzerland whose aim was the promotion of fascism, and served as its British correspondent. He also became close to one of his neighbours, the economist Arthur Kitson, a member of The Britons. Their friendship lasted until Kitson's death in 1937. The latter persuaded Leese that control of money was the key to power and that money was ultimately controlled by the Jews. Kitson supplied him with a copy of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, on which Leese wrote, \\"Everything in this little book rang true, I simply could not put it down until I had finished it.\\" Leese also revered The Britons' founder Henry Hamilton Beamish as an anti-Jewish \\"pioneer\\". In 1924, he was elected a councillor to Stamford Town Council along with fellow fascist Harry Simpson, becoming the first elected fascist councillors in Britain. The British Fascists had generally chosen not to intervene in \\"the despised democratic system\\", and Leese's own contempt for democracy seems to have been paradoxically reinforced by the election. He wrote, \\"Many people I knew voted for me because I had cured their pigs or pets and without the slightest idea what I stood for\\". Leese was generally unsatisfied with the policies of the British Fascists, dismissing them as \\"conservatism with knobs on\\". In 1925, he and Simpson joined a splinter group of the BF, the National Fascisti (NF), renamed in July 1926 the British National Fascists (BNF). Leese took the Stamford BF branch over to the BNF and, following the collapse of the BNF in May 1927, founded the 'Fascist League' from the remnants of the Stamford BNF. In October 1927, he stepped down as a councillor after having served a single term, and retired in June 1928, at 50, before moving to Guildford, Surrey. Imperial Fascist League Emblem of the Imperial Fascist League, founded and headed by Leese from 1929 to 1939 In 1929, Leese established his own organization, the Imperial Fascist League (IFL). The movement was initially modelled more along the lines of Italian fascism but, under the influence of Henry Hamilton Beamish, it began to focus on anti-semitism. The IFL and its extensive publishing interests were funded out of Leese's own pocket. In 1932, Oswald Mosley approached Leese with the aim of absorbing the IFL into his own British Union of Fascists and, while relations between the two men were initially cordial (Leese had addressed a New Party meeting on 27 April 1932 on the theme of \\"The Blindness of British Politics under the Jew Money-Power\\" that was chaired by Mosley),Robert Skidelsky, Oswald Mosley, Macmillan 1975, p. 291 Leese soon attacked Mosley for his failure to deal with the \\"Jewish question\\", and he eventually labelled Mosley's group \\"kosher fascists\\". Leese's anti-semitism had become his defining political characteristic by that point and it came to take on an increasingly conspiratorial and hysterical tone. This increased after Leese visited Germany and met Julius Streicher, and he subsequently remodelled the IFL newspaper The Fascist along the lines of Der St√ºrmer. His anti-semitism took on the theme of the Aryan race as the creator of civilisation and culture and he claimed that the Aryan was in a permanent struggle with the Jew, the outcome of which would determine the future completely. His views, which extended to proposing as early as 1935 the mass murder of Jews by the use of gas chambers,Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century, Continuum, 2000, p. 183 earned him a prison sentence in 1936 when he was indicted along with fellow IFL member, printer Walter Whitehead, on six counts related to two articles published in the July issue of The Fascist entitled \\"Jewish Ritual Murder\\", which later appeared as a pamphlet. He was convicted and jailed for six months in lieu of a fine for causing a public mischief. On his release, he edited another pamphlet entitled My Irrelevant Defence, a lengthy diatribe in defence of his earlier claim that Jewish Passover celebrations included the sacrifice of Christian children. He also used materials distributed by the Welt-Dienst news service headed by Ulrich Fleischhauer and wrote for it. Second World War He was one of the last leaders of the fascist movement to be interned in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the Second World War under the Defence Regulation 18B. Leese, who claimed that his primary loyalty was to Britain, had been somewhat critical of Adolf Hitler since the start of the war and he reacted with bitter anger when an internment order was issued for him in June 1940. Having set up a series of hideouts from which he published several pamphlets that were critical of the war, he evaded capture until 9 November 1940. Still enraged by what he saw as a slur on his patriotism, Leese violently resisted arrest and smashed up his holding cell. Leese saw the war as a \\"Jew's War\\" but he strongly repudiated the Hitler-Stalin Pact and castigated the Nazis for their invasion of Norway. (Leese labelled his political creed \\"Racial Fascism\\" because he disliked the term \\"National Socialism\\" which was used by the Nazis, although he and other members of the IFL supported Nazi anti-semitism). He was released from detention in 1944 on health grounds following a major operation. At the close of the War he offered to testify at William Joyce's trial. Along with Beamish he was prepared to give evidence on the \\"Jewish issue\\" at Nuremberg in defence of the Nazis.Leese, Arnold Out of Step; Events in the Two Lives of an Anti-Jewish Camel Doctor p70 Leese described the Nuremberg Trials as a \\"Jewish and Masonic affair, like the procedure in this country under '18.B'; it is an act of Revenge\\". Post-war activity Soon after the end of the Second World War, Leese set up his own \\"Jewish Information Bureau\\" and began publishing his own journal, Gothic Ripples, which was largely concerned with attacking the Jews. He believed that there were 2.5m Jews in Britain at the time, seven times the actual number. The magazine also contained a strongly anti-black racist bent, with a regular column entitled \\"Nigger Notes\\" appearing. Gothic Ripples was an early proponent of what would come to be known as Holocaust denial, noting in 1953 that \\"The fable of the slaughter of six million Jews by Hitler has never been tackled by Gothic Ripples because we take the view that we would have liked Hitler even better if the figure had been larger; we are so 'obsessed with anti-semitism' that we believe that as long as the destruction was done in a humane manner, it was to the advantage of everyone ... if it had been true. However, it wasn't\\". Leese returned to prison in 1947 when, along with seven other former members of the IFL, he was given a one-year sentence for helping escaped German prisoners of war, who had been members of the Waffen SS. In 1948, Leese formed the National Workers Movement in London.\\"Arnold Leese, Notorious Anti-semite, Organizes New National Workers Party in Britain\\", Jewish Telegraphic Agency 11/2/1948 In December 1950 he stood trial for criminal libel on Harold Scott, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, but was acquitted. In 1951, he published his autobiography Out of Step: Events in the Two Lives of an Anti-Jewish Camel Doctor. Leese acted as mentor to Colin Jordan and John Tyndall, the \\"most significant figures on the extreme right since the 1960s\\". After his death, his widow, May Winifred Leese (died 1974), helped fund far-right groups. His London house, 74 Princedale Road, Holland Park, was left to Jordan, and became known as 'Arnold Leese House'. The property became Jordan's base of operations, housing the White Defence League, the National Socialist Movement and other far-right operations. Leese died 18 January 1956, aged 77.

Types (United States) Discount stores in the United States may be classified into different types: =Discount superstore, Discount department store= Discount superstores such as Walmart or Target sell general merchandise in a big-box store; many have a full grocery selection and are thus hypermarkets, though that term is not generally used in North America. In the 1960s and 1970s the term discount department store was used, and chains such as Kmart, Zodys and TG&Y; billed themselves as such.\\"History\\", \\"Kmart\\", Transformco website, accessed July 3, 2020 The term \\"discount department store\\" or \\"off-price department store\\" is sometimes applied to big- box discount retailers of apparel and home goods, such as Ross Dress For Less, Marshalls, and Kohls. =Category killers= So-called category killer stores, specialize in one type of merchandise and sell it in big-box stores. Examples include Petco and Petsmart (pet supplies), HomeGoods (home furnishings and accessories), or Staples, Office Depot and OfficeMax (office supplies). =Warehouse clubs= When membership is required, discount superstores are known as warehouse clubs, and often require purchases of larger sizes or quantities of goods than a regular superstore. =Discount grocery store= Discount grocery stores include Aldi, Lidl, and Grocery Outlet. Currently Aldi, the largest retailer in the world (Planet Retail Ranking; June 2014), operates more than 10,121 discount stores or discount shops worldwide. =Variety stores, dollar stores= Variety stores, which used to commonly be known as five and dimes or dime stores, and now are most common as dollar stores such as Dollar General, which sell goods usually only at a single price-point or multiples thereof (¬£1, $2, etc.). During the early and mid- twentieth century chains such as Woolworth's, J. J. Newberry and S. S. Kresge lined the streets of shopping districts of America's downtowns and suburbs; these stores had origins as five and ten cent stores, but later moved to a model with flexible price points, with a variety of general merchandise at discounted prices, in formats smaller than today's discount superstores. Techniques Discounters rely on bulk purchase and efficient distribution to keep down costs. History =United States= During the period from the 1950s to the late 1980s, discount stores were more popular than the average supermarket or department store in the United States. There were hundreds of discount stores in operation, with their most successful period occurring during the mid-1960s in the U.S. with discount store chains such as Kmart, Ames, Two Guys, Gibson's Discount Center, E. J. Korvette, Mammoth Mart, Fisher's Big Wheel, Zayre, Bradlees, Caldor, Jamesway, Howard Brothers Discount Stores, Kuhn's-Big K (sold to Walmart in 1981), TG&Y; and Woolco (closed in 1983, part sold to Wal-Mart) among others. Walmart, Kmart, and Target all opened their first locations in 1962. Kmart was a venture of S. S. Kresge Company that was a major operator of dime stores. Other retail companies branched out into the discount store business around that time as adjuncts to their older store concepts. As examples, Woolworth opened a Woolco chain (also in 1962); Montgomery Ward opened Jefferson Ward; Chicago-based Jewel launched Turn Style; and Central Indiana-based L. S. Ayres created Ayr- Way. J. C. Penney opened discount stores called Treasure Island or The Treasury, Sheboygan, Wisconsin based H. C. Prange Co. opened a chain of discount stores called Prange Way, and Atlanta-based Rich's owned discount stores called Richway. During the late 1970s and the 1980s, these chains typically were either shut down or sold to a larger competitor. Kmart and Target themselves are examples of adjuncts, although their growth prompted their respective parent companies to abandon their older concepts (the S. S. Kresge five and dime store disappeared, while the Dayton-Hudson Corporation eventually divested itself of its department store holdings and renamed itself Target Corporation). In the United States, discount stores had 42% of overall retail market share in 1987; in 2010, they had 87%.\\"America's top stores.\\" 'Consumer Reports, June 2010, p. 17. Many of the major discounters now operate \\"supercenters\\", which add a full-service grocery store to the traditional format. The Meijer chain in the Midwest consists entirely of supercenters, while Wal-Mart and Target have focused on the format as of the 1990s as a key to their continued growth. Although discount stores and department stores have different retailing goals and different markets, a recent development in retailing is the \\"discount department store\\", such as Sears Essentials, which is a combination of the Kmart and Sears formats, after the companies' merger as Sears Holdings Corporation. =Canada= Woolworths entered Canada in the 1920s, the stores were converted to the Foot Locker, Champs Sports and other stores in 1994. Kresge's, a competitor to Woolworth's entered the Canadian market in 1929. Zellers was founded in 1931, and was acquired by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1978. Giant Tiger opened its first store in Ottawa in 1961, modeled on Woolworths. Winners was founded in 1982 in Toronto, and sells off- price brand clothing. Costco entered Canada in 1986. In 1990, the American chain Walmart purchased the Woolco chain in Canada, and converted the stores to Walmarts. Dollarama was founded in Quebec in 1992. In 1998, Zellers bought out Kmart Canada, taking over its stores. In 2011, Marshalls, owned by the American TJX Companies, entered Canada, and Zellers sold most of its stores to Target, but still operates 2 stores (in Etobicoke and Nepean) as liquidation centres for The Bay merchandise. Target Canada filed for bankruptcy in 2015, selling its stores to Walmart, Lowe's and Canadian Tire. In 2016, the Hudson's Bay Company started opening Saks Off 5th locations to sell off-price brands. American off-price chain Nordstrom Rack has announced that its first Canadian location will be opened in Vaughan Mills in 2018.

Older Stalker used the 2.8 or 3.4 l 60¬∞ V6 engine out of a mid-1990s Chevrolet Camaro or Pontiac Firebird. Most Stalkers now use the GM 3800 series II or III V6, in both naturally aspirated and supercharged forms. The supercharged version is known as a Super Stalker. Stalkers trophied at the SCCA SOLO NATIONALS 2007 (Scott Minehart), N.A.S.A. Time Trial Nationals at Mid Ohio (Dennis Brunton), Run and Gun Pro Class Top Dog 2007 (Dennis Brunton), and Street Tire Top Dog (Justin Sims) at Gateway International Raceway. A Stalker (as of April 2008) holds the Time Trial Unlimited Track Record at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida, with a time of 1:32.8 seconds (Dennis Brunton). In July 2010, after a change in company ownership from Dennis Brunton to Scott Minehart, Brunton Auto began to redesign the Stalker and in 2012, introduced the new version called the Stalker M-Spec. Redesigned elements included the following: the Chevrolet S-10 components were eliminated, in favor of double wishbone suspension, which makes the M-spec one of the few Lotus Seven kit car replicas with independent suspension in both front & rear. Single adjustable shocks are mounted inboard and connect to the suspension arms using pushrods and rockers, similar to a Formula 1 car's suspension design. The M-Spec model and its variants were designed to easily accommodate specific GM V6 & V8 engines, and even allows both Manual & Automatic transmission options. M-Spec models are also offered in different sizes and body styles: The original M-Spec body differs from the traditional Lotus Seven shape with its hood scoop, integrated LED headlight housings, and one piece rear bodywork where the fenders are integrated with the rest of the rear bodywork. The Classic R model uses the M-Spec chassis but retains a more traditional Lotus Seven appearance to the body. The XL model of the M-Spec chassis is longer & wider than the original M-Spec, which allows for more room in both the engine bay and passenger compartment. The AXR model, introduced in late 2014, is a purpose built autocross track car and is smaller than the original M-Spec. Brunton Auto is currently located in St. Petersburg, Florida, and has produced approximately 200 kits thus far. To assist buyers of their kit, Brunton Auto has created & maintains many different online build videos, pictures, and written guides, as well as an email group to connect the Stalker community together. Brunton Auto must grant access to either of these resources.

Long (April 13, 1866 ‚Äì September 16, 1909) was an American shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Kansas City Cowboys, Boston Beaneaters, New York Highlanders, Detroit Tigers, and Philadelphia Phillies. Long was known for his great fielding range as a shortstop, but he also holds the MLB record for career errors. Early life Born in 1866, Long was a native of Chicago. His parents are thought to have been German immigrants, as Long spoke fluent German. Little else is known about Long's life up until he began playing minor league baseball in 1887 for a team in Arkansas City, Kansas. He played in Kansas City in 1888. After that season, the Kansas City team merged with the major league team in the same city. Baseball career Long played for the Kansas City Cowboys (1889), Boston Beaneaters (1890‚Äì1902), New York Highlanders (1903), Detroit Tigers (1903), and Philadelphia Phillies (1904). Between 1904 and 1906, Long was a player and player-manager in minor league baseball. Long holds the major league record for most errors in a career (1,096).Historical Player Stats  MLB.com: Stats at mlb.mlb.com Only three other players have made more than 1,000 errors in their careers: Bill Dahlen, Deacon White, and Germany Smith. Long's total includes a record 1,070 errors committed while playing shortstop. Despite the errors, Long actually fielded slightly better than the league average for a shortstop during his career, and he was considered an excellent fielder by his contemporaries. The seeming contradiction between a high error rate and exceptional fielding skill is attributable to the fact that Long had a greater fielding range than most shortstops. He could get to balls batted to his left and right that other fielders would not have reached; a certain percentage of these difficult plays were mishandled, resulting in Long being charged with errors on grounders and flies that lesser shortstops would not have touched (and on which they would not be charged with errors). There was also another major factor which contributed to Long's relatively large total of career errors: the comparative abundance of errors during gameplay, in 19th century professional baseball. In a typical game played in the 1800s, each team committed about ten errors (for a one-game combined total of about 20). Of the three other players charged with over 1,000 lifetime errors, Deacon White is in Baseball's Hall of Fame, and Bill Dahlen is perennially considered for enshrinement by MLB's Veteran's Committee. Tim Murnane, a former player-turned-baseball writer, wrote in 1894, \\"Long is the most brilliant ball player on the field at the present time.\\"Pages from Baseball's Past (subscription newsletter), by Craig R. Wright, January 20, 2014 In 1903, (future Hall of Fame) pitcher Kid Nichols said of Long, \\"Herman Long is the greatest shortstop of them all. You can speak of your [Hughie] Jennings, and write of your [Jack] Glasscocks all you want, but this man Long at his best had them beat by a city block. Jennings was a brilliant ball player, and without doubt one of the leading players of the age, but this talk of his being better than Herman Long is all rot.\\" Death In August 1909, The New York Times reported that Long was very sick. Several months earlier, he had moved to Denver, Colorado, because he was suffering from a lung condition. He died of tuberculosis the next month in Denver.

In 2008, the Brook Street swimming pools and the Sutton Centre ice rink were closed and the Lammas Leisure Centre on Lammas Road opened. The formal opening was performed by Dame Kelly Holmes. The Lammas Leisure Centre has 2 swimming pools (main and teaching), an ice rink (home to Sutton Sting Ice Hockey Academy), a gym, a multi-purpose sports hall and an indoor bowling green. = Sports clubs = There is a local athletics club, the Sutton-in-Ashfield Harriers,http://www.sutton-in-ashfield- harriers.co.uk/ and swimming club associated with both local schools and the Lammas Leisure Centre itself. There is also the multi-faceted Coxmoor Golf Club on Coxmoor Road (B6139), next to the A611. As a result of local council grant applications for sport development, Sebastian Coe opened a new athletics track for the town at the nearby Ashfield School in February 2007. = Sutton Town AFC = Sutton Town was a football club founded in 1923. Known as the Snipes, the team was a member of the Midland League from 1923 to 1927. The club was reborn in 1958 and was a member of the Midland League until 1982 when the club became a founding member of the Northern Counties East League.http://www.fchd.info/SUTTONTA.HTM In 1992, the team name was changed to Ashfield United, but the team folded after the 1996-97 season.http://www.fchd.info/ASHFIELU.HTM North Notts Football Club began operations in 2000 as a member of the Central Midlands League, changing its name to Sutton Town AFC for the 2001-03 season.http://www.fchd.info/N-NOTTS.HTM The team finished runner up in 2002-03, winning promotion to the Northern Counties East League. In 2004-05 the club won promotion to the NCEL Premier Division. However, in 2007-08, the club resigned from the NCEL and moved down the football pyramid to the Central Midlands League.http://www.fchd.info/SUTTTXNN.HTM The club was promoted to the East Midlands Counties League in 2013 but in June 2014 the club resigned from the league after they were unable to come to a suitable agreement over a lease at home ground \\"The Fieldings\\" that would enable them to get promoted in the future, which was a league requirement. = Greyhound racing = A greyhound racing track was opened around the Avenue Ground situated on the Mansfield Road behind the Pot Makers Arms, a venue used by Sutton Town AFC. The first meeting took place on 14 May 1932. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. Racing came to an end there on 13 May 1972.  Former Industry =Coal mining= Sutton Colliery was outside of the town in Stanton Hill. The colliery closed in 1989. Silverhill Colliery was also a colliery in nearby Teversal. The site has now been landscaped. =Hosiery= The Pretty Polly brand of hosiery originated in the town in around 1927, and was manufactured there on Unwin Road until April 2005. Samuel Eden Socks closed in July 2005.

The novel explores the theme of the √úbermensch (superman) in the character of John Wainwright, whose supernormal human mentality inevitably leads to conflict with normal human society and to the destruction of the utopian colony founded by John and other superhumans. The novel resonates with the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and the work of English writer J. D. Beresford, with an allusion to Beresford's superhuman child character of Victor Stott in The Hampdenshire Wonder (1911). As the devoted narrator remarks, John does not feel obliged to observe the restricted morality of Homo sapiens. Stapledon's recurrent vision of cosmic angst ‚Äì that the universe may be indifferent to intelligence, no matter how spiritually refined ‚Äì also gives the story added depth. Later explorations of the theme of the superhuman and of the incompatibility of the normal with the supernormal occur in the works of Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Frank Herbert, Wilmar Shiras, Robert Heinlein and Vernor Vinge, among others. The book is mentioned by Julian May in Intervention, part of the Galactic Milieu Series. It is also responsible for coining the term \\"homo superior\\". Protagonist John is extremely intelligent even if he is retarded in his physical development. Like Stapledon himself, he believes in communist ideas but is critical of mainstream Marxism. He is also quite vain and highly skilful in the arts of seduction. From a human viewpoint, he can be considered amoral or perhaps to be following a morality beyond human understanding.

(10 December 1855 ‚Äì 24 October 1956) was an English botanist, geologist and naturalist who lived much of his life in Singapore. He was instrumental in promoting rubber trees in the Malay Peninsula and, for the fervour with which he pursued it, came to be called as \\"Mad Ridley\\". Life Ridley beside a Hevea with herring-bone pattern bark incisions to tap rubber. Henry Ridley was the second son and third child born to Louisa Pole Stuart and Oliver Matthew Ridley in West Harling in Norfolk, where his father was the Rector. At the age of three his mother died and his father moved to Cobham in Kent. He studied at Tonbridge School and then went to Haileybury where his brother Stuart also studied. At Cobham, he had taken to the idea of collecting insects and he continued this at Haileybury where the school encouraged him to publish a \\"List of the Mammals and Coleoptera of Haileybury\\". The two brothers left Haileybury and Henry went to a private tutor at Medmenham near Henley who encouraged him in Zoology and then went to Exeter College, Oxford where he studied under Edwin Ray Lankester and George Rolleston while also taking an interest in botany and geology under the influence of Marmaduke Lawson and Joseph Prestwich. He graduated in 1878 and received a Burdett-Coutts scholarship that let him conduct research on fossils from quarries near Oxford. He then joined the British Museum in the botany department to replace Henry Trimen who had moved to Ceylon. He specialised in the monocotyledons and also began to travel around Europe. In 1887 he joined the Royal Society expedition with George Ramage to the island of Fernando de Noronha off Brazil, and published on the collections on returning. In 1888 he applied and was selected for the post of director of Gardens and Forests in the Straits Settlements. He was to meet Odoardo Beccari at Florence for information and to meet Trimen at Peradeniya to learn about rubber cultivation along the route. Reaching Singapore, he was the first scientific director in charge of the botanical gardens and in charge of introducing new plants of economical value. Ridley established the methods for harvesting latex from Par√° rubber plants which had been introduced ten years earlier by Sir Hugh Low apart from starting a zoological section in the gardens in 1870. Ridley explored the regions around including Penang and Malacca. In 1894 his post was abolished as the expenditure was found to exceed the revenues obtained. Ridley returned briefly to England but the removal of the post was however objected to by William Turner Thiselton-Dyer and Ridley went back to Selangor to advise on forest reservation. Ridley spent many years promoting rubber as a commercial product, which he was known for being passionate; therefore, he was nicknamed \\"Mad Ridley\\". In 1895, he discovered a means of tapping which did not seriously damage the rubber trees. Ridley was also largely responsible for establishing the rubber industry on the Malay peninsula, where he resided for twenty years. The area under Par√° rubber slowly increased after 1898 when a Chinese landowner, Tan Chay Yan, grew 40 acres successfully, leading to more people taking to rubber cultivation. Ridley was also working on the botany of the region, collecting widely. He then returned to England in 1911 and stayed at Kew to work on a botanical treatise of the region. This five-volume Flora was published from 1922 to 1925. In 1930, he published a seminal and comprehensive work on plant dispersal. This work was the culmination of his own observations over several years, and a review of widely scattered literature on the subject. On his 100th birthday in 1955 he received a visit from the High Commissioner of the soon-to-be independent Malaya. He married Lily Eliza Doran when he was 83 years old. Ridley died in Kew, short of his 101st birthday on 24 October 1956. Publications A near-complete list of publications can be found in the 80th birthday dedication issue of the Gardens' Bulletin (1935). The following are a few selected publications.    * Eponymous species Several species are named after Henry Ridley, including Diospyros ridleyi, Stenolepis ridleyi, and Amphisbaena ridleyi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Ridley\\", p. 221). It has been claimed that the olive ridley sea turtle is named after him, but this has been questioned as there is insufficient evidence. It is more likely that the turtle's common name comes from the word \\"riddle\\".

He played for the Providence Grays (1881‚Äì1885), St. Louis Maroons (1886), Indianapolis Hoosiers (1888‚Äì1889), New York Giants (1890‚Äì1891), Cleveland Spiders (1891), Philadelphia Phillies (1891), and Louisville Colonels (1893‚Äì1894). After leaving the major leagues, Denny continued playing minor league baseball until 1902. He was the last major league position player (non-pitcher) to play his entire career on the diamond without wearing a fielding glove. Name Eldridge attended St. Mary's College, Phoenix, Arizona, in the late 1870s, and wanted to play semi-professional baseball during the summer months, when he wasn't playing for the college as an amateur. He used the pseudonym \\"Jerry Denny\\" to hide his professional play from the college. Professional achievements Denny holds the major league record for most chances by a third baseman in a single game, handling 16 chances during an 18-inning match on August 17, 1882.http://baseball-almanac.com/rb_3bch.shtml In 1884, Denny helped the National League champion Grays defeat the New York Metropolitans of the American Association in the major leagues' first post-season championship match-up. That season, he was the Grays' leader in home runs (six, and one in the championship series) and runs batted in (59), and second in extra-base hits (37). Denny's career totals are 1,237 games, 4,946 at bats, 714 runs, 1,286 hits, 238 doubles, 76 triples, 74 home runs, 667 RBI, 130 stolen bases, 173 walks, and a batting average of .260. Unconventional fielding technique At the time Denny began his professional career, fielding gloves had not yet become standard equipment, other than padded mitts for catchers and first basemen. Fielding gloves gradually gained acceptance between 1885 and the mid-1890s, but Denny refused to adapt. He was one of the few ambidextrous major league players; although he threw primarily with his right arm, he could also toss with his left. This gave him a defensive advantage at his customary field position‚Äîin ranging to his left on a ground ball, if he saw a play at second base, instead of having to transfer the ball to his right hand while pivoting and repositioning his body (as third basemen would customarily do), Denny could dispatch the ball to second with his left hand. This skill contributed to his refusal to wear a glove in the field, long after most players considered gloves essential.

He was appointed government botanist for the then colony of Victoria by Governor Charles La Trobe in 1853, and later director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. He also founded the National Herbarium of Victoria. He named many Australian plants. Early life Mueller was born at Rostock, in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. After the early death of his parents, Frederick and Louisa, his grandparents gave him a good education in T√∂nning, Schleswig. Apprenticed to a chemist at the age of 15, he passed his pharmaceutical examinations and studied botany under Professor Ernst Ferdinand Nolte (1791‚Äì1875) at Kiel University. In 1847, he received his degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Kiel for a thesis on the plants of the southern regions of Schleswig.Doctoral certificate, University of Kiel, 2 August 1847, reproduced in Home et al. Vol. 1, p 99. Mueller's sister Bertha had been advised to seek a warmer climate for her health, and the great botanist Ludwig Preiss, who had recently returned from Perth, recommended Australia, so in 1847, Mueller and his two surviving sisters sailed from Bremen. While still on the ship, he reportedly fished his first plants out of the water to analyse them. He arrived at Adelaide on 18 December 1847 and found employment as a chemist with Moritz J. Heuzenroeder, in Rundle Street. He was an inveterate explorer, walking alone to Mount Arden and Mount Brown during his first year. Shortly afterwards, he obtained of land not far from Adelaide in the Bugle Ranges, and had a cottage built there. He moved there with his sister Clara, intending to start a farm, but after a few months, he returned to his former employment.Interview with F E H W Krichauff South Australian Register 12 October 1896 p.7 accessed 20 August 2011 Mueller thought to open a chemist's shop in the gold diggings, so in 1851, he moved to Melbourne, capital of the new colony of Victoria. He had contributed a few papers on botanical subjects to German periodicals, and in 1852, sent a paper to the Linnean Society of London on \\"The Flora of South Australia\\", thus beginning to be well known in botanical circles. Victorian Government Botanist left Mueller was appointed government botanist for Victoria by Governor Charles La Trobe in 1853, a post that was newly created for him. He examined its flora, especially the Alpine vegetation of Australia, which was previously unknown. He explored the Buffalo Ranges, then went to the upper reaches of the Goulburn River and across Gippsland to the coast. The neighbourhoods of Port Albert and Wilsons Promontory were explored, and the journey of some was completed along the coast to Melbourne. In the same year, he established the National Herbarium of Victoria, which can still be visited today. It has many plants from Australia and abroad, many of which were collected by Mueller. Also, his large private library was transferred to the government of Victoria in 1865 and is incorporated into the library of the herbarium in Melbourne.Victoria,1864‚Äì 5, Parliamentary Papers, No, 72: \\"Annual Report of the Government Botanist and Director of the Botanic Garden. Then, as a phytographic naturalist, he joined the expedition sent out under Augustus Gregory by the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for the colonies. He explored the Victoria River and other portions of North Australia, was one of the four who reached Termination Lake in 1856, and accompanied Gregory's expedition overland to Moreton Bay. Mueller, for his part, found nearly 800 species in Australia new to science. He published in this year his Definitions of Rare or Hitherto Undescribed Australian Plants. From 1854 to 1872, Mueller was a member of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science, which later became the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was president of the Philosophical Institute in 1859 when it received a royal charter and became the Royal Society of Victoria. He was an active member of the society's \\"Exploration Committee\\" which established the Burke and Wills expedition of 1860. Mueller promoted the exploration of Australia, and as one of only two members of the Exploration Committee with any experience of exploration, he made several speeches to the society on the topic. He did not favour the selection of Burke as leader, but due to factionalism in the committee, he had little say in the establishment, provisioning, or composition of the exploration party.Lost Explorers by Ed Wright Murdock Books 2008 Bust of Mueller at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. From 1857 to 1873, he was director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, and not only introduced many plants into Victoria, but also made the excellent qualities of the blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) known all over the world, and succeeded in introducing it into the south of Europe, North and South Africa, California, and the extratropical portions of South America. Mueller was decorated by many foreign countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, and Portugal. He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1861, and knighted as Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1879. A list of his 'Orders, offices, affiliations and sundry honours' has been assembled.Home et al., vol 3, pp. 838 ‚Äì 858. Many of his decorations were received in return for supplying zoological specimens to royal museums.Lucas, A M (2013) Specimens and the Currency of Honour: the Museum Trade of Ferdinand von Mueller, Historical Records of Australian Science, 24:15‚Äì39 He was the benefactor of explorer Ernest Giles, who visited Lake Amadeus and Kata Tjuta. Giles had originally wanted to name these Lake Mueller and Mt Ferdinand,http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/management/history/european- contact.html but Mueller prevailed upon Giles to name them Lake Amadeus, after King Amadeus of Spain, and Mt Olga, after Queen Olga of W√ºrttemberg; both kings had granted him honours. In 1871, King Karl of W√ºrttemberg gave him the hereditary title of Freiherr, to mark his distinction in 'natural sciences generally and in particular for the natural history collections and institutions of Our Kingdom'Letters patent by Karl I, 6 July 1871, reproduced and translated in Home et al., vol 2, pp 580 ‚Äì 582 He was then known as Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller. By 1873, influential Melburnians were critical of Mueller's scientific and educational approach with the Royal Botanic Gardens. Development of the gardens with an eye to aesthetics was sought. Mueller was dismissed from his position as director of the Botanic Gardens on 31 May 1873.Helen M Cohn and Sara Maroske 'Relief from duties of minor importance: the removal of Baron von Mueller from the directorship of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens', Victorian Historical Journal, 67, (1996) pp. 103‚Äì127 He had done much to develop the gardens with the scarce resources at hand. Though his pay was not affected and he still continued as the government botanist, he never lost his sense of grievance over losing the position. In April 1873, Mueller had created the genus Guilfoylia and described William Guilfoyle as \\"distinguished as a collector [who] evidenced great ardour\\" and held high hopes for his collecting ability. Mueller's opinion changed when Guilfoyle was appointed to take his place as director of the Botanic Gardens in July 1873. He accused Guilfoyle of being a \\"nurseryman [with] no claims to scientific knowledge whatever\\" and of getting the job due to being related to the wife of the responsible minister. Mueller subsequently abolished Guilfoylia as part of the genus of Cadellia in his botanical census of 1882. Guilfoyle went on to landscape the gardens in an aesthetic and pleasing style welcomed by most Melburnians.Weston Bate, 'Perceptions of Melbourne's \\"Pride and glory\\"', Victorian Historical Journal, vol 67, 4 ‚Äì 16, 1996 In 1857, Mueller applied for and was granted the degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of Rostock;Degree certificate transcribed and translated in Home et al, vol 1, pp 334‚Äì336; in 1883, he was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales. He published 11 volumes of Fragmenta phytographica Australiae (1862‚Äì1881), two volumes of the Plants of Victoria (1860‚Äì1865), and other books on the Eucalyptus, Myoporaceae, Acacia, and Salsolaceae, all profusely illustrated. He also co-operated in the production of George Bentham's Flora Australiensis.Lucas, A. M. Assistance at a distance: George Bentham, Ferdinand von Mueller and the production of Flora australiensis. Archives of natural history 30 (2): 255‚Äì281. 2003 He described many novel plant species sent by botanists from other parts of Australia, notably Maurice William Holtze from the Northern Territory, and encouraged settlers to send plants to him. Many women contributed to his collections, including Louisa Atkinson and Sarah Brooks.Maroske, S. and Vaughan, A. (2014). Ferdinand Mueller‚Äôs female plant collectors: a biographical register. Muelleria, 32: 92‚Äì172 He took a leading part in promoting Australian exploration, especially the Burke and Wills expedition, which was the first to cross the continent, and in the various attempts to unravel the mystery which attended the fate of his fellow countryman Ludwig Leichhardt (1813‚Äì1848). Mueller died in Melbourne and is buried in the St Kilda Cemetery. He was survived by his sister, Mrs. Clara Wehl, of Millicent, South Australia. His other sister, Mrs. Bertha Doughty of near Penola predeceased him. He never married. Mueller was a theist who rejected Darwinism, but is said by historians to have misunderstood key aspects of Charles Darwin's theory. Despite his differences he remained on friendly terms with Darwin.Lucas, A. M. (2010). Ferdinand von Mueller's interactions with Charles Darwin and his response to Darwinism.

A sense of existential questioning suffuses the book, as the author delves into aspects of Sirius's psyche. The novel deals with many human issues through Sirius and his experiences, his unusual nature, his ideas and his relationships with humans. The characters go to great lengths to prevent Sirius from becoming a circus-type wonderdog, and instead, they seek to develop Sirius's character much like a family would create and foster that of a human child. Plot summary Sirius is raised by scientist Thomas Trelone in North Wales, near Trawsfynydd. Thomas embarks on a program of using steroids and other chemicals to rapidly develop cognitive power of dogs, resulting in super sheep dogs. Sirius, however, proves to possess a dog intelligence comparable to a normal human being, as he is able to communicate with English words, although it takes some time for the humans to understand his canine pronunciation. He is born at the same time as his creator's human daughter, Plaxy, and the two of them are raised together as brother and sister. During childhood, Sirius and Plaxy develop an intense bond for each other. Their physical and intellectual growth become a sort of competition, with Sirius striving to equal his handed sister. But as they grew, their relationship comes under strain, as Sirius develops a dog-like sensitivity to sound leading to a unique musicality, while Plaxy had a strong visual aesthetic. Their different sensory experiences afforded less interest in each other's experience of the world. Soon it was time for Plaxy to attend primary school, but Sirius could not attend. Despite his pleas to learn, Plaxy became reluctant to share her school and social life experiences with him. Their lives drifted further apart. When Plaxy departed to attend boarding school, Thomas wanted to bring Sirius to Mr. Pugh's farm, where he would work as a \\"sheep-dog apprentice\\" before taking him to the city, believing the experience would be beneficial to his character. However, Thomas wanted Sirius to keep most of his human intelligence a secret, with Pugh only suspecting him to be a \\"Super-super-sheep-dog.\\" After a period of time, Sirius became desperately lonely and longed for his family, Plaxy especially. He yearned to write to her, and after weeks of difficulty and strings of failure, but gradually building upon his successes, he managed to write and send out a letter to her, without the aid of human hands. After a year being a silent sheep-dog, save for the holidays with Thomas and Plaxy, Sirius surprises Thomas by describing the psychological trauma he has experienced. Sorely realizing the insensitivity of his program, Thomas decides to show Sirius the university, where he marvels in awe. Sirius is acquainted with his creator's most trusted colleagues and scientists. They soon begin to study his mind and body. Months pass, and his new life as a pampered laboratory animal takes a toll on his physical and mental well-being, becoming overweight and agitated. After realizing his declining state, he arranges a meeting with Plaxy, now a university student. Plaxy, however, does little to console his feelings. After sensing her coldness and discomfort with him, Sirius is left feeling nauseated. As they part for the night, an embittered and dispirited Sirius strolls through town. His mind floods with brooding thoughts of his own loneliness, analyzing the cruelty and hypocrisy of humankind, and the harshness of the universe towards all living things. Miserably depressed, lonely, and frustrated, he sought for an outlet to express the \\"spirit\\" within him. He develops a mystical idea of the perfect hunting, which is associated with his sophisticated sense of smell. The scent he pursues, the prey he's looking for is God. Sirius experiences a spiritual epiphany, seeing and sensing the world in a new light. He becomes instantly fascinated by human religion, realizing it had the answers he sought for, beyond the strict boundaries of science. His foster-mother, Elizabeth, agrees to take Sirius to a priest, Rev. Geoffrey Adams, who serves in the impoverished East End. Over a period of time, Sirius converses with Geoffrey, hoping to find the heart of spiritual truth and love, but is disappointed to learn that human religion has become lost in its doctrine and mythology. Fortunately, he discovers one outlet for his spirit, his feelings and life experience. After great persuasion to express himself, Geoffrey, with caution, allows Sirius to sing in his church ‚Äî in front of an astounded audience. When Sirius returns home, he mostly works as a sophisticated sheep-dog. But after seeing the destruction, death and misery of war, and mankind's stupidity, combined with his unique nature, which makes him isolated, he has a spiritual breakdown, and begins to indulge more and more his \\"wolf mood\\" which is irrational and murderously destructive. The final part of the story deals with his hatred towards humans and towards himself, and his violent acts. It also deals with the rumors of the rural community about Sirius' advanced nature being the work of the devil, and the scandal of Plaxy possibly having a sexual relationship with Sirius ‚Äî which the novel's narrator, Plaxy's human lover, indirectly suggests that their love has a physical nature, but not directly sexual. Plaxy and Sirius have, during the whole tale, their political and personal issues, but also a very special bond, which leads to the idea of a mystical or metaphysical relationship, transcending ordinary love and understanding, which Plaxy refers to as a unique double-being, a 'Plaxy-Sirius.' Eventually, Plaxy is conscripted during the Second World War. People continued to attack Sirius, and he subsequently sinks into deep despair. The hysterically religious population, who seek to vent their own fear and frustration with the war on an easy target, persecute Sirius with increasing violence, provoking violent responses by Sirius. Depression with what he calls the \\"tyrant species\\" cause him to abandon many of his more humane pursuits and live wild, killing many animals on their farms. One farmer and his sheepdogs venture out to hunt him, but Sirius kills the farmer in self-defense. Fear and rage rises in the town, solidifying their resolve to destroy him. Plaxy, after a desperate search, finds a terrified and feral Sirius, hiding from the townspeople. Plaxy manages to re-awaken Sirius' human mind, and tries to console him. But Sirius laments, realizing there's no place for him in the world, insisting that his human- needing spirit, and his wild wolf-side, made his nature fundamentally incompatible and torn. As they planned for their escape to Scotland, Sirius is hunted and eventually shot by the community. He dies professing his love for Plaxy, stating their life and time together, despite all the hardship, was worthwhile.

The hill presents a steep rocky eastern face overlooking the Sound of Raasay, contrasting with gentler grassy slopes to the west. Geology The Storr is a prime example of the Trotternish landslip, the longest such feature in Great Britain. It is the type locality for the mineral gyrolite.\\"Gyrolite\\". Mindat.org. Retrieved 22 October 2012. The area in front of the cliffs of the Storr is known as the Sanctuary. This has a number of weirdly shaped rock pinnacles, the remnants of ancient landslips. Ascent routes A well-constructed path, used by many sightseers, leaves the A855 just north of Loch Leathan. It heads up through a clearfell area that was formerly a conifer plantation. Most day-trippers are content simply to wander around the Sanctuary, admiring the pinnacles and gazing up at the Storr's eastern cliffs. Walkers can easily ascend to the summit, however, by skirting below the cliffs whilst heading north from the north end of the Sanctuary. After passing over a fence at a makeshift stile and climbing a brief steep section of loose rock, the recommended route for walkers heads north-west as far as Coire Scamadal, 1 km north of the summit, then doubles back and heads southwards along the north side, climbing towards the summit. From this route, visible breaks in the cliffs offer tempting short cuts, but these are steep, may not save time and may not be safe. An alternative route, involving some mild scrambling, follows the rim of the south-east-facing cliffs from the top of the aforementioned steep section. Another route to or from the summit starts south-west of the car park and heads north-west to Bealach Beag, about south-west of the summit, following the course of a stream which breaches the cliffs. A steep section of this course is slippery and requires care. The Storr is often climbed as part of a much longer expedition, following the full length of the Trotternish landslip. Media and the arts From 1 August to 17 September 2005 one of Britain's single largest environmental artworks was staged on the walk up to Coire Faoin at the base of the Old Man of Storr and the Storr cliffs. Created by NVA, a Scottish environmental arts company, directed by Angus Farquhar (formerly of Test Dept) and designed by a team including \\"\\" and David Bryant from Midnight Design, the work contained music by Geir Jenssen, Paul Mounsey, live performance by Gaelic singer Anne Martin and recordings of the works of Gaelic poet Somhairle MacGill-Eain (Sorley MacLean). This was David Bryant's last major environmental creative work as he died from cancer in 2007. He won a Plasa Lighting Design award in 2006 for his work lighting the Storr.

Its most northerly point, Rubha H√πinis, is the most northerly point of Skye. One of the peninsula's better-known features is the Trotternish landslip, a massive landslide that runs almost the full length of the peninsula, some .Ordnance Survey Landranger 1:50000 Map. Sheet 23. North Skye, Dunvegan & Portree. The landslip contains two of Skye's most famous landmarks: the Old Man of Storr, an isolated rocky pinnacle, and the Quiraing, an area of dramatic and unusual rock formations. The summit of The Storr, on whose slopes the Old Man of Storr is located, is the highest point of the peninsula. The north-eastern part of the peninsula around Quiraing is designated as a National Scenic Area and the entire landslip is a Special Area of Conservation. Dinosaur footprints have been found at An Corran, which is also a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC. The ruins of the 14th‚Äì15th-century Duntulm Castle stand at the northern end of the peninsula. The three major settlements on Trotternish are Portree, generally regarded as the capital of Skye, Uig, a ferry terminus, and Staffin. Trotternish is the strongest Gaelic-speaking area of Skye. Geography and natural history Dinosaur footprint on beach at Staffin. Trotternish is underlain by basalt, which provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The Kilt Rock is named after the tartan-like patterns in the cliffs. The Quiraing is a spectacular series of rock pinnacles on the eastern side of the main spine of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the Old Man of Storr. While having many vertical heights, the area is mainly unsuitable for rock-climbing due to the friable rock. At An Corran near Staffin a local resident found a slab bearing a dinosaur track, probably made by a small ornithopod. Experts subsequently found more dinosaur prints of up to 50 cm, the largest found in Scotland, made by a creature similar to Megalosaurus. At about 160 million years old they are the youngest dinosaur remains to be found in Scotland. =Conservation designations= The north- eastern part of the peninsula around Quiraing is designated as the Trotternish National Scenic Area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 7,919 ha in total, of which 6,128 ha is on land, with a further 1789 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level, and covering the seas to the east of the peninsula). The entire length of the Trotternish landslip is protected as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the Natura 2000 programme, and classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. History Duntulm Castle. A Mesolithic hunter- gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at in Staffin is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at Sand, Applecross, on the mainland coast of Wester Ross where tools made of a mudstone from have been found. Surveys of the area between the two shores of the Inner Sound and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33 sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits.Saville, Alan; Hardy, Karen; Miket, Roger; Ballin, Torben Bjarke \\"An Corran, Staffin, Skye: a Rockshelter with Mesolithic and Later Occupation\\" .

During the 17th century it was the seat of the chiefs of Clan MacDonald of Sleat, and is a scheduled monument. The castle is believed to stand on the site of a prehistoric broch or dun known as Dun David, or Dun Dhaibhidh, although no archaeological evidence has been found for this predecessor. The castle was built in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the area was subject to feuds between the rival MacLeod and Macdonald clans, and was abandoned around 1732, when Sir Alexander MacDonald built a new residence, Monkstadt House, to the south. Flodigarry north of Staffin was between 1750 and 1772 the home of Flora MacDonald, the Jacobite made famous by her part in Charles Edward Stuart's escape after his defeat at Culloden. She later moved to Kingsburgh on the southwestern coast of Trotternish, and it was here that Boswell and Johnson met her during their tour of the Western Isles in 1773.

In 2010, Comunn na G√†idhlig named Staffin as their Gaelic Community of the Year. Transport The main road in Trotternish is the A87, which runs between Portree at the southern end of the peninsula and Uig on the northwest coast. Uig marks the northwestern terminus of the A87, with its southeastern terminus being the junction with the A82 at Invergarry, to the north of Fort William. The A855 road also links Portree and Uig, taking a route along the eastern coast and round the northern end of the peninsula: the two roads thus combine to encircle Trotternish. A minor road also crosses the peninsula, passing between Uig and Staffin via the Quiraing. Portree is the terminus for Scottish Citylink buses from Glasgow Buchanan bus station and Inverness, with some services continuing on to Uig. Uig serves as the ferry terminal for Caledonian MacBrayne services to Tarbert on Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist, providing links with the Outer Hebrides.

It is known as the \\"coup by memorandum\\", which the military delivered in lieu of sending out tanks, as it had done previously. The event came amid worsening domestic strife, but ultimately did little to halt this phenomenon. Background As the 1960s wore on, violence and instability plagued Turkey. An economic recession late in that decade sparked a wave of social unrest marked by street demonstrations, labour strikes and political assassinations.Cleveland, William L. A history of the modern Middle East. Westview Press (2004), , p.283 Left-wing workers' and students' movements were formed, countered on the right by Islamist and militant Turkish nationalist groups.Nohlen, Dieter, et al. (2001) Elections in Asia and the Pacific: A Data Handbook. Oxford University Press, , p.235 The left carried out bombing attacks, robberies and kidnappings; from the end of 1968, and increasingly during 1969 and 1970, left-wing violence was matched and surpassed by far-right violence, notably from the Grey Wolves. On the political front, Prime Minister S√ºleyman Demirel's centre-right Justice Party government, re-elected in 1969, also experienced trouble. Various factions within his party defected to form splinter groups of their own, gradually reducing his parliamentary majority and bringing the legislative process to a halt. By January 1971, Turkey appeared to be in a state of chaos. The universities had ceased to function. Students, emulating Latin American urban guerrillas, robbed banks and kidnapped US servicemen, also attacking American targets. The homes of university professors critical of the government were bombed by neo-fascist militants. Factories were on strike and more workdays were lost between 1 January and 12 March 1971 than during any prior year. The Islamist movement had become more aggressive and its party, the National Order Party, openly rejected Atat√ºrk and Kemalism, infuriating the Turkish Armed Forces. Demirel's government, weakened by defections, seemed paralyzed in the face of the campus and street violence and unable to pass any serious legislation on social and financial reform. Memorandum It was in this atmosphere that on 12 March, the Chief of the General Staff, Memduh Taƒüma√ß, handed the prime minister a memorandum, really amounting to an ultimatum by the armed forces. It demanded \\"the formation, within the context of democratic principles, of a strong and credible government, which will neutralise the current anarchical situation and which, inspired by Atat√ºrk's views, will implement the reformist laws envisaged by the constitution\\", putting an end to the \\"anarchy, fratricidal strife, and social and economic unrest\\". If the demands were not met, the army would \\"exercise its constitutional duty\\" and take over power itself. Demirel resigned after a three-hour meeting with his cabinet;\\"Turkish Regime Is Ousted By the Military Leaders\\", The New York Times, 13 March 1971, p.1 veteran politician and opposition leader ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º sharply denounced any military meddling in politics. While the precise reasons for the intervention remain disputed, there were three broad motivations behind the memorandum. First, senior commanders believed Demirel had lost his grip on power and was unable to deal with rising public disorder and political terrorism, so they wished to return order to Turkey. Second, many officers seem to have been unwilling to bear responsibility for the government's violent measures, such as the suppression of Istanbul workers' demonstrations the previous June; more radical members believed coercion alone could not stop popular unrest and Marxist revolutionary movements, and that the social and economic reformism behind the 1960 coup needed to be put into practice. Finally, a minority of senior officers concluded that progress within a liberal democratic system was impossible, and that authoritarianism would result in a more egalitarian, independent and \\"modern\\" Turkey; other officers felt they had to intervene, if only to forestall these radical elements. The coup did not come as a surprise to most Turks, but the direction it would take was uncertain, as its collective nature made it difficult to discern which faction in the armed forces had seized the initiative. The liberal intelligentsia hoped it was the radical-reformist wing led by Air Force commander Muhsin Batur, who favoured implementing reforms envisaged by the 1961 constitution; they were thus encouraged by the memorandum. Their hopes were dashed when it turned out that the high command had taken power, animated by the spectre of a communist threat, and not a radical group of officers as in 1960. (There were rumours the high command had acted to pre-empt a similar move by junior officers; the notion was seemingly confirmed when a number of officers were retired soon afterwards.) The \\"restoration of law and order\\" was given priority; in practice this meant repressing any group viewed as leftist. On the day of the coup, the public prosecutor opened a case against the Workers' Party of Turkey for carrying out communist propaganda and supporting Kurdish separatism. He also sought to close all youth organisations affiliated with Dev-Gen√ß, the Federation of the Revolutionary Youth of Turkey, blamed for the left-wing youth violence and university and urban agitation. Police searches in offices of the teachers' union and university clubs were carried out. Such actions encouraged vigilante action by the \\"Idealist Hearths\\", the youth branch of the Nationalist Action Party; provincial teachers and Workers' Party supporters became prime targets. The principal motive for the suppression of the left seems to have been to curb trade union militancy and the demands for higher wages and better working conditions. The commanders who seized power were reluctant to exercise it directly, deterred by the problems that faced the Greek junta. They had little choice but to rule through an Assembly dominated by conservative, anti-reformist parties and an \\"above- party\\" government which was expected to carry out the reforms. The military chiefs would give directives from behind the scenes. To lead this government, on 19 March they chose Professor Nihat Erim, acceptable to the Justice Party and the more conservative faction of the Republican People's Party. (This included ƒ∞n√∂n√º, who embraced the generals once they picked his close associate, but the party's general secretary B√ºlent Ecevit was infuriated and resigned from his post. For his part, Demirel cautioned his party to remain calm.) Erim appointed a technocratic cabinet from outside the political establishment to carry out the commanders' socio-economic reform programme. The regime rested on an unstable balance of power between civilian politicians and the military; it was neither a normal elected government, nor an outright military dictatorship which could entirely ignore parliamentary opposition. Aftermath Prime Minister Nihat Erim visiting Richard Nixon at the White House a year later In April, politics was eclipsed (and the envisaged reform put off until after 1973) when a new wave of terror began, carried out by the Turkish People's Liberation Army, in the form of kidnappings with ransom demands and bank robberies. Intelligence sources confirmed rumours that dissident junior officers and military cadets were directing this force. On 27 April, martial law was declared in 11 of 67 provinces, including major urban areas and Kurdish regions. Soon, youth organisations were banned, union meetings prohibited, leftist (but not militant neo-fascist) publications proscribed and strikes declared illegal. After the Israeli consul was abducted on 17 May, hundreds of students, young academics, writers, trade unionists and Workers' Party activists‚Äînot just leftists but also people with liberal- progressive sympathies‚Äîwere detained and tortured. The consul was shot four days later after a daytime curfew had been announced. For the next two years, repression continued, with martial law renewed every two months. Constitutional reforms repealed some of the essential liberal fragments of the 1961 Constitution and allowed the government to withdraw fundamental rights in case of \\"abuse\\". The National Intelligence Organization (Mƒ∞T) used the Ziverbey Villa as a torture center, employing physical and psychological coercion. The Counter-Guerrillas were active in the same building, with interrogations directed by their mainly Central Intelligence Agency-trained specialists, and resulting in hundreds of deaths or permanent injuries. Among their victims was journalist Uƒüur Mumcu, arrested shortly after the coup, who later wrote that his torturers informed him even the president could not touch them. Ferit Melen, who made little impression, took over the premiership in April 1972, followed a year later by Naim Talu, whose main task was to lead the country to elections. (An important reassertion of civilian influence took place in March‚ÄìApril 1973, when Demirel and Ecevit, normally at odds, both rejected the generals' choice for president, instead having Fahri Korut√ºrk elected to the post by the Assembly.) By summer 1973, the military-backed regime had achieved most of its political tasks. The constitution was amended so as to strengthen the state against civil society; special courts were in place to deal with all forms of dissent quickly and ruthlessly (these tried over 3,000 people before their abolition in 1976); the universities, their autonomy ended, had been made to curb the radicalism of students and faculty; radio, television, newspapers and the constitutional court were curtailed; the National Security Council was made more powerful; and, once the Workers' Party was dissolved in July 1971, the trade unions were pacified and left in an ideological vacuum. That May, Necmettin Erbakan's National Order Party had been shut down, which the government claimed showed its even-handedness in the anti-terror campaign, but he was not tried and allowed to resume his activities in October 1972; the National Action Party and the right-wing terrorists who worked under its aegis were left conspicuously alone. In October 1973, Ecevit, who had won control of the Republican People's Party from ƒ∞n√∂n√º, won an upset victory. Nevertheless, the very same problems highlighted in the memorandum re-emerged. A fragmented party system and unstable governments held hostage by small right-wing parties contributed to political polarization. The economy deteriorated, the Grey Wolves escalated and intensified political terrorism as the 1970s progressed, and left-wing groups too carried out acts aimed at causing chaos and demoralization. In 1980, seeking once again to restore order, the military carried out yet another coup.

The club was founded in 1858 and is the oldest open rugby club in the world since becoming open in 1862. \\"Open\\" in this context means that membership was open to anyone, not merely those attending, or old boys from, a particular institution (e.g. a school, university or hospital). It is also the third-oldest rugby club in continuous existence in the world, after Dublin University Football Club and Edinburgh Academical Football Club. The Blackheath club also helped organise the world's first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871) and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later ‚Äì the players meeting and getting changed at the Princess of Wales public house. Blackheath, along with Civil Service F.C., is one of the two clubs that can claim to be a founder member of both The Football Association and the Rugby Football Union. The club currently play in National League 1, the third tier of the English rugby union system, with matches played at Well Hall, after a move from Rectory Field in Blackheath at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. History =Early history= The institution was founded as \\"Blackheath Football Club\\" in 1858 by old boys of Blackheath Proprietary School who played a \\"carrying\\" game of football made popular by Rugby School. When the old boys played against the current pupils supporters would shout for either \\"Club\\" or \\"School\\" accordingly. This is why to this day supporters of BFC shout for \\"Club\\", not for \\"Blackheath\\". In 1863 the club developed the tactic of passing the ball from player to player as an alternative to the solo break and the \\"kick and follow-up\\". In 1863 Blackheath was a founder member of The Football Association which was formed at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, on Lincoln Inn Fields, London 26 October 1863 with the intention to frame a code of laws that would embrace the best and most acceptable points of all the various methods of play under the one heading of \\"football\\". Francis Maule Campbell, a member of Blackheath, was elected treasurer. At the fifth meeting Campbell argued that hacking was an essential element of 'football' and that to eliminate hacking would \\"do away with all the courage and pluck from the game, and I will be bound over to bring over a lot of Frenchmen who would beat you with a week‚Äôs practice.\\"Richard Holt,Sport and the British: A Modern History, Oxford University Press, 1990 , p. 86 At the sixth meeting on 8 December Campbell withdrew Blackheath, explaining that the rules that the FA intended to adopt would destroy the game and all interest in it. Other rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the Football Association. In this way the great divide between soccer and rugby took place. In December 1870 Edwin Ash, secretary of Richmond Football Club published a letter in the papers which said, \\"Those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play.\\" On 26 January 1871 a meeting attended by representatives from 22 clubs was held in London at the Pall Mall Restaurant. As a result of this meeting the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded. Three lawyers who had been pupils at Rugby School drew up the first laws of the game which were approved in June 1871. The Club is one of seven of the original twenty-one clubs to have survived to this day. =Later history= Oxford University in 1905 Blackheath initially played its matches on the Heath (meeting and changing at the Princess of Wales public house) but occasional interruptions from spectators led the club to move, initially to a private field (Richardson's Field) in Blackheath before moving to the Rectory Field in 1883. On 27 March 1871, England (captained by Blackheath's captain and with three other Club players in the 20-strong side) played Scotland at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, losing by one point. This was the first international rugby union game in history. Richardson's Field hosted the first England v. Wales fixture on 19 February 1881, which England won, again with four Club players in the side. In 1982 Blackheath joined the list of winning teams at the Glengarth Sevens at Stockport R.U.F.C. Blackheath were one of the opponents for The Original All Blacks on their 1905‚Äì06 northern hemisphere tour, the first ever New Zealand rugby union tour outside of Australasia. The touring side ran out 32‚Äì0 victors. After 158 years it was announced that the 2015‚Äì16 season would be the last playing at the historic Rectory Field as the club had made the difficult decision to move to their training ground, Well Hall in Eltham, for the 2016‚Äì17 season to maximise matchday revenue and to continue developing for the future. Blackheath played their last game at the Rectory Field on 30 April 2016, beating Blaydon 45‚Äì17.

In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway () was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church declared Olaf a saint in 1164. His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, until his death in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances. The story of the Battle of Stiklestad as most know it gradually developed during the two centuries following the death of King Olaf. Being a Saint, Olaf must have fallen in a major battle for Christianity. Background During the 9th century, Norway was divided between several local kings controlling their own fiefdoms. By the end of the century, King Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: Haraldr H√°rfagri, Harald H√•rfagre in modern Norwegian) managed, mainly due to the military superiority gained by his alliance with Sigurd Ladejarl of Nidaros, to subjugate these mini‚Äìkingdoms, and he created a unified Norwegian state. This alliance came apart after Harald's death. The jarls of Lade and various descendants of Harald Fairhair would spend the next century interlocked in feuds over power. As well as power politics, religion also played a part in these conflicts, as two of the descendants of Harald Fairhair, Hakon the Good and Olaf Tryggvason attempted to convert the then heathen Norwegians to Christianity. In the year 1000, Svein (Old Norse: Sveinn) and Erik (Old Norse: Eir√≠kr) of Lade took control over Norway, being supported by the Danish King Svein. In 1015, Olaf Haraldsson, representing the descendants of Harald Fairhair, returned from one of his Viking trips and was immediately elected as King of Norway. In June 1016, he won the Battle at Nesjar against the Jarls of Lade. Olav Haraldsson's success in becoming King of Norway was helped by the Danes being kept occupied with the ongoing fighting in England. In the year 1028, the Danish King Cnut the Great made an alliance with the Lades, and Olaf had to go into exile in Kievan Rus (Old Norse: Gar√∞ar√≠ki). In the year of 1029 the last Lade, Hakon Jarl, drowned and Olaf returned to Norway with his army to regain his throne and the Kingdom of Norway. Battle According to saga sources, Olaf traveled with his 3,600 man army through Sweden and crossed the mountains into the valley of Verdal (Old Norse: Veradalr), about north of the city of Trondheim. Olaf and his men arrived at Stiklestad, a farm in the lower part of the valley. This was where the Battle of Stiklestad took place, as described by Snorri Sturluson in his famous work Heimskringla, written about 200 years later. At Stiklestad, Olaf met an army led by H√°rek of Tj√∏tta (Old Norse: H√°rekr √≥r √ûj√≥ttu), Thorir Hund from Bjark√∏y and K√°lfr √Årnason, a man who previously served Olaf. The peasant army consisted of one hundred hundred according to Snorri, which in long hundreds means 14,400, and not 10,000. He states that the battle cry of Olaf's men was Fram! Fram! Kristmenn, krossmenn, kongsmenn! (Forward! Forward! Men of Christ, men of the cross, men of the king!), while that of the opposing army was Fram! Fram! Bonder! (Forward! Forward! farmers!). King Olaf's fall According to Snorri, Olaf received three severe woundsin the knee, in the neck, and while leaning against a large stone the final mortal spear thrust up under his mail shirt and into his belly. According to saga sources, Thorir was among those who gave Olaf his lethal wounds, together with Kalv Arnesson and Torstein Knarresmed from Rovde in Sunnm√∏re.\\"Kalv Arnesson\\", Norsk biografisk leksikon While earlier sources do not specify who dealt the king his blows, Snorri makes Thorir Hund responsible for the latter, using the spear that had killed his nephew and set the fallout between the king and Thorir in motion. During the Battle of Stiklestad, King Olaf almost killed Thorir Hund with a war hammer. However, Torstein Knarresmed managed to get between them and gave Olaf a wound right above his left knee. Shortly later Thorir Hund thrust his spear into the king's stomach before Kalv Arnesson struck the king in the throat with his sword. Torstein Knarresmed was subsequently killed by a blow in the back but was revenged later that same day by one of Thorir's men. Snorre Sturluson Heimskringla Kongesagaer (Norr√∏n Mytologi / Norr√∏n Tid ¬© Idar Lind)The king's body was carried away and buried secretly in the sandy banks of the Nidelva River south of the city of Trondheim. Aftermath Saint Olaf The year after the battle, his grave and coffin were opened and according to Snorri the body was incorrupt and the hair and nails had grown since he was buried. The coffin was then moved to St. Clement's Church in Trondheim. Among the bishops that Olaf had brought with him from England, was Grimketel and it was he that initiated the beatification of Olaf on 3 August. Stiklestad Church (Stiklestad kyrkje) was erected on top of the stone against which St Olaf died. The stone is supposedly still inside the altar of the church. One hundred years later, Nidaros Cathedral was built in Trondheim on the site of his original burial place. Olaf's body was moved to this church and enshrined in a silver reliquary behind the high altar. This reliquary took the form of a miniature church, common to medieval reliquaries containing the entire body of a saint, but was unique in that it is said to have had dragon heads at the apex of the gables similar to those still seen on Norwegian stave churches. In the 16th century, during the Protestant Reformation period, Olaf's body was removed from this reliquary, which was melted down for coinage by order of the Dano- Norwegian king. His remains were reburied somewhere in Nidaros Cathedralexactly where is still today an unsolved mystery. Queen Josephine of Leuchtenberg of Norway and Sweden, the consort of Oscar I, asked for the one known remaining relic of St. Olaf, an ulna or radius in a medieval reliquary in the Danish National Museum, from King Frederick VII of Denmark, which he gave to her and which she in turn gave to St. Olaf's Cathedral in Oslo in August 1862. Evaluation While Snorri's description of the battles in the Heimskringla makes for epic reading although its grandeur most likely must be put down to the writer's taste for the grand. In Gardarike, Olaf was only surrounded by his most loyal followers. Neither can one expect that recruitment was especially ample in Sweden or through the sparsely populated valleys through which Olaf travelled. Thus, Olaf's army probably was of a rather rag-tag character, an impression accentuated by tales of how local robber groups would join it as Olaf made his way down Verdal. The recruitment of robber gangs and other scofflaws was likely no surprise to the polytheistic heathens that opposed Olaf's attempts to forcibly convert them by murdering and torturing regional Jarls and Kings to terrorize them into accepting Christianity. In fact, why Olaf chose to travel through the politically hostile Tr√∏ndelag, rather than to try to rally his relatives and political allies of Eastern Norway, is to this day an unsolved mystery. Perhaps he was making a last-ditch attempt for Nidaros, hoping to win acceptance for his claim to the throne amongst the peasants of Tr√∏ndelag. On the other hand, the opposition, basically lower nobles and grand farmers under the influence of King Cnut, could not have had much time to assemble a large force. When alerted to Olaf's presence, they must have responded swiftly, considering that they met Olaf relatively far up in the valley. Therefore, their action points more towards a small, hastily arranged rally of men rather than the elaborate logistics that would have been needed to assemble a 10,000 man strong army. Those who could have mobilized a large scale army, the local nobles of Tr√∏ndelag (of which Einar Thambarskelfir was a prime example) were notable largely by their absence on either side. Also, a battlefield of a raging battle between nearly 20,000 men should have produced rich archeological findings to that effect; at Stiklestad, however, these are sparse. This however, is common in Norway ‚Äì the rocky soil is not as well suited to battlefield archaeology like continental and English soil, it makes georadar readings all but unusable and the location of the battle site highly uncertain. On Stiklestad, however, the soil is deep soil with some clay, and georadar has been used in 2008, showing traces of large buildings, but not much to indicate a battlefield. As is the case with most battles mentioned in the sagas, the sizes of the battling armies are probably impossible to determine. Olaf's role in Norwegian history had only just begun at his death. While nobles and rich farmers had expected their position to improve with the removal of the aggressive Olaf, the opposite happened. The rule of Cnut's mistress and their infant son Svein was exceedingly harsh on the people. Especially the church, a traditional ally of Olaf, came under the squeeze. Thus, it accentuated the late king's martyr status, as it joined and egged on common folk in revolting against the hardships enforced by the succeeding Danish rule. Propaganda proclaiming how heroic Olaf's last stand had been made for great nation-building material in the immature Norwegian state where the warrior ethic of the Vikings and their Gods and Goddesses were still highly revered. According to Snorri, even nature lent a hand, as the day of the battle coincided with a nearly full solar eclipse, as reflected in the description of an ill-fated 'blooded red sun', which was interpreted as a certain omen of bad things to come. However, the solar eclipse took place at about 2:00 p.m. on August 31 that year contrary to the traditional date of the battle on July 29.Hybrid Solar Eclipse of 1030 August 31 (Heliophysics Science Division) Olaf was a rather stubborn and rash ruler. Modern historians generally agree that Olaf was inclined to violence and brutality. Ironically he became Norway's patron saint. His canonization was performed only a year after his death by the bishop of Nidaros. The cult of Olaf not only unified the country, it also fulfilled the conversion of the nation, something for which the king had fought so hard. While divisive in life, in death Olaf becameRex Perpetuus Norvegiaethe eternal king of Norway wielded a unifying power no foreign monarch could hope to undo. Cnut, most distracted by the task of administering England, managed to rule Norway for five years after the battle through his viceroy son Svein. However, when Olaf's illegitimate son Magnus (dubbed 'the Good') laid claim to the Norwegian throne, Cnut had to yield. Thus, a century of prosperity and expansion followed, lasting until the kingdom again descended into the Civil war era in Norway over the issue of succession.'Theodoricus Monachus Historia de antiquitate regum Norwagiensium Legacy Memorial in Stalheim Olavsst√∏tta at Olavhaugen Stiklestad National Cultural Center (Stiklestad Nasjonale Kultursenter) at Verdal was established by a parliamentary resolution in 1995. Olavsst√∏tta is a monument in the Stiklestad National Cultural Center. It was erected in 1807 in memory of the Battle of Stiklestad. The memorial is one of the oldest preserved public monuments in Norway. In 1901, poet Per Sivle wrote a poem Tord Foleson, about King Olaf's standard-bearer at the battle. Foleson was able to plant the banner before he died, and it remained standing throughout the battle, even after the king fell. It was kept erect and replaced by the local populace for centuries, and a memorial stands at the site today. The most famous line of the poem, Merket det stend, um mannen han stupa ('The symbol stands, even when the man falls'), is inscribed on the memorial in Stalheim, Norway. It is also on the inscription wall in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp memorial site.Per Sivle (Store norske leksikon) King Olaf II of Norway in The Saint Olav Drama in 2014. The Saint Olav Drama () is an outdoor theatre performance played every end of July in Stiklestad. In July 1954, the owner of the farm at Stiklestad gave permission for the performance of a play based on the battle on his property. The play was written by Olav Gullv√•g and has been staged every year since 1954. Annually, people travel to Stiklestad to watch The Saint Olaf Drama at what is now the largest outdoor theatre in Scandinavia.Spelet om Heilag Olav (Store norske leksikon) See also * Olavsfestival * Olavinlinna * √ìlavs√∏ka * Olsok * Legendary Saga of St. Olaf * Separate Saga of St. Olaf References Other sources * Bagge, Sverre Cross and Scepter (Princeton University Press. 2014) * Bagge, Sverre From Viking Stronghold to Christian Kingdom (Museum Tusculanum Press. 2010) * Henriksen, Vera St Olav of Norway: King, saint and enigma ( TANO. 1985) * Myklebus, Morten Olaf Viking & Saint (Norwegian Council for Cultural Affairs, 1997) * Winroth, Anders The Conversion of Scandinavia (Yale University Press. 2012) Further reading In Norwegian * Ekrem, Inger; et al.

The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 1,014. Macmillan, New York, 1991. In May 1940, Wagner was part of the Action T4 euthanasia program at Hartheim with administrative functions. Due to his experience in T4, Wagner was assigned to help establish the Sobib√≥r extermination camp in March 1942. Once the gassing installations were completed, Wagner became deputy commandant of the camp under Commandant Franz Stangl. His official title was quartermaster-sergeant of the camp.Sobibor Interviews: Biographies of SS-men Wagner was in charge of selecting which prisoners from the newly arrived transports would be used as slave laborers in and outside the camp, and which would be sent to their deaths in the gas chambers. When Wagner was on vacation or attending to duties elsewhere, Karl Frenzel assumed his role within the camp. More than any other officer at Sobib√≥r, Wagner was responsible for the daily interactions with prisoners. Wagner supervised the routine and daily life at Sobib√≥r, and he was one of the most brutal SS officers. Survivors of the camp described him as a cold-blooded sadist. Wagner was known to beat and thrash camp inmates on a regular basis, and to kill Jews without reason or restraint. Inmate Moshe Bahir described him: Erich Bauer would later remark: Inmate Eda Lichtman wrote that on the Jewish fast day of Yom Kippur, Wagner appeared at roll call, selected some prisoners, gave them bread and forced them to eat it. As the prisoners ate the bread, Wagner laughed loudly, enjoying his joke because he knew that these Jews were pious. One of the Sobib√≥r prisoners improvised a song which ironically described camp life (original text with English translation): Wagner enjoyed this song and he forced the prisoners to sing it frequently. After two Jews escaped from Sobib√≥r in the spring of 1943, Wagner was put in charge of a squad of soldiers from the Wehrmacht, who laid minefields around the camp so as to prevent further escapes. However, these efforts did not prevent another escape, which took form in the Sobib√≥r revolt. Wagner was not present at the camp on the day of the Sobib√≥r revolt (14 October 1943), having taken a holiday with his then wife Karin to celebrate the birth of a daughter, Marion. The inmates knew of Wagner's absence and believed that it would improve their chances of success. Wagner was considered the strictest in terms of prisoner supervision at the camp. After the successful revolt, Wagner was ordered to aid in closing the camp. He helped to dismantle and remove evidence of the camp by ruthlessly commanding the Jewish prisoners who performed this task. For instance, after the Arbeitsjuden (\\"worker Jews\\") had been transported from Treblinka and had successfully torn down the Sobib√≥r barracks, Wagner killed them. Heinrich Himmler considered Wagner to be \\"one of the most deserving men of Operation Reinhard\\" (). After Sobib√≥r, Wagner was transferred to Italy, where he participated in the deportation of Jews. After World War II Szlomo Szmajzner confronts Gustav Wagner (Jornal do Brasil, 1 June 1978) Wagner was sentenced to death in absentia, but escaped with Franz Stangl to Brazil. Clergy at the Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome assisted Wagner in his flight from justice to Syria. Wagner was admitted as a permanent resident on 12 April 1950 and on a Brazilian passport was issued in the name of \\"G√ºnther Mendel\\", his new identity. He worked as a house-helper for a wealthy Brazilian family and then as a maker of concrete fence posts. He married a local woman who was a widow and raised her children. By 1967, his wife had died, and he was 'down on his luck' and living as a beggar in Sao Bernardo in 1971. He then found work as a farm hand and continued to live in Brazil undisturbed until he was exposed by Simon Wiesenthal and arrested on 30 May 1978. Extradition requests from Israel, Austria, and Poland were rejected by the Attorney General of Brazil, . On 22 June 1979, the Supreme Federal Court also rejected a West German extradition request. Wagner, in a 1979 BBC interview, showed no remorse for his activities in running the camp, remarking: In October 1980, Wagner was found with a knife in his chest in S√£o Paulo. According to his attorney, Wagner committed suicide. His date of death was determined to be 3 October 1980.

During his diplomatic career, he served as United States ambassador to Japan, Belgium, Austria, and Iran, as well as Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs. Life MacArthur's parents were Captain Arthur MacArthur III and Mary McCalla MacArthur. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Bowman H. McCalla, great-grandson of Colonel Horace Binney Sargent, and great-great-grandson of Lucius Manlius Sargent. Named for his uncle, General Douglas MacArthur, he was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1909. He graduated from Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., and from Yale College, Class of 1932. He married Laura Louise Barkley on August 21, 1934, the daughter of future U.S. Vice President Alben Barkley. Diplomatic career After serving as an Army officer, MacArthur began his Foreign Service career in 1935 with a post in Vancouver. He was assigned to Vichy France during the early years of World War II, served as secretary of the U.S. Embassy there from 1940 to 1942, and was interned in Baden, Baden Germany with other American diplomatic staff and civilians for two years after the US broke relations with the Vichy government. Following an internee exchange in March 1944, he served as part of General Dwight Eisenhower's political staff, and then led the political section of the U.S. Embassy in Paris until 1948. He went on to become chief of the State Department's Division of Western European Affairs in 1949, where he assisted in the formation of NATO, and served as Counselor of the State Department from 1953 to 1956, where he led the U.S. negotiations for the SEATO treaty. = Ambassador to Japan = MacArthur was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to Japan in December 1956, and presented his credentials in February 1957. During his four years in Tokyo, MacArthur oversaw the re-negotiation of the US-Japan Security Treaty, known as \\"Anpo\\" in Japanese. The new treaty was met with the massive Anpo Protests in Japan, and was only ratified with great difficulty. It was revealed in 1974 that MacArthur negotiated a secret agreement with Japanese foreign minister Aiichiro Fujiyama to allow the movement of American nuclear weapons through Japanese territory. It was also revealed, through documents declassified in the 2000s, that MacArthur pressured the Japanese judiciary, including Chief Justice Kotaro Tanaka, to uphold the legality of the United States military presence in Japan following a lower court decision that found it to be unconstitutional. MacArthur appeared on the cover of the June 27, 1960 issue of Time magazine, in which he was characterized as \\"the principal architect of present-day U.S. policy toward Japan.\\" = Other posts = Following his time in Japan, MacArthur served as Ambassador to Belgium (1961‚Äì1965), Assistant Secretary of State (1965‚Äì1967), Ambassador to Austria (1967‚Äì1969) and Ambassador to Iran (1969‚Äì1972).

Abraham Trembley (3 September 1710 ‚Äì 12 May 1784 Geneva) was a Genevan naturalist. He is best known for being the first to study freshwater polyps or hydra and for being among the first to develop experimental zoology. His mastery of experimental method has led some historians of science to credit him as the \\"father of biology\\". Biography Trembley came from an officer's family from Geneva, Republic of Geneva. He was uncle to Charles Bonnet, with whom he corresponded regularly, as well as to Ren√©-Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur (1683‚Äì1757) and Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729‚Äì1799). Trembley acted as tutor to the two children of Count Willem Bentinck van Rhoon (1704‚Äì1774), a prominent Dutch politician at the time. The boys were 3 and 6 when Trembley, during lessons in which he went fishing in the ponds outside the house, accidentally discovered the regenerative powers of the Hydra. Those lessons took place at the Count's summer residence of Sorgvliet nearby The Hague. Sketches and drawings of his experiments with the children, made by Cornelis Pronk, are kept in the archives of the town of The Hague, the Netherlands.  Work on hydra  While Trembley thought he had discovered a new species, Leeuwenhoek had in fact first published on hydra in a 1702‚Äì1703 volume of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, describing them as a type of \\"animalculum\\". In his work Leeuwenhoek clearly described the process of budding, as well as their tentacles' contractility and the presence of cnidocyte batteries on tentacles.

His discoveries lead to his membership of the prestigious Royal Society in London and a correspondent member of the acad√©mie des sciences in France. He became also recipient of the Copley medal.

After humping his swag around much of New South Wales and Queensland through the Great Depression, in 1936, just as his first pieces of writing were being published, Hooton was introduced to the poet Marie E. J. Pitt living in Melbourne and carried on a correspondence with her for the next eight years. Literary development Hooton's first book of poetry, These Poets, appeared in 1941, published at his own expense in a small print run of up to 400 copies, most of which Hooton either gave away or swapped. It struck a chord with readers, receiving much critical acclaim. In 1943 Hooton met the authors Nettie Palmer and Miles Franklin while they were travelling through Newcastle. Through Miles Franklin he was introduced to the writings of Carl Sandburg and the American literary scene. Moving to Sydney in 1943 Hooton submitted a book of poems titled Leave Yourself Alone to a publisher without success. Later he self-published Things You See When You Haven't Got A Gun. In a new magazine, untitled, unpretentious and called simply No. 1., the poetry of Hooton, A. D. Hope, and Gary Lyle was featured. Hooton and Hope also featured in No. 2. Hooton's Things You See When You Haven't Got A Gun was reviewed by Max Harris in one line in the Ern Malley issue of Angry Penguins, 'Our anarchist bull careers madly through his intellectual fog.' =\\"Sydney Push\\" milieu= In Sydney after World War II, Hooton was drawn to the intellectual circles of Sydney University, the Sydney Push and the wider artistic society of the LincolnWeblin, Mark (ed.)

Appleton and others have noted Hooton's opposition to the generally favoured realist philosophy of Professor John Anderson and its activist offshoot, the Libertarian Society. > When Anderson's realist philosophy held intellectual sway at Sydney > University, Hooton attacked vehemently philosophy and universities (he > claimed sometimes that Anderson was his main enemy, although he defended > Anderson when he thought he was being wrongly attacked). To a literary world > influenced by people such as Joyce, Yeats, Pound and Eliot, Hooton decried > them as anti-artists, philistines and charlatans. He admitted only a few > people as poets, including Whitman, Wilde and Henry Lawson. Appleton explained: \\"Hooton held that polemic was an art form and that all poetry should be didactic\\", an obtuse view which, coupled with his paradoxical debating style, brought Hooton into conflict with Libertarians (who especially revered Joyce's Ulysses) and with more puristic poets such as Lex Banning, James McAuley and A.D. Hope. Yet his presence was compelling and characteristically welcomed by those who would otherwise be in disagreement. Many years later, Germaine Greer noted his influence on her: > ...Harry, the utopian anarchist who had admired her red stockings, who > believed people were perfect and who was not weighed down by the tremendous > forces the anarchistic pessimists felt bore down on them all the time. > \\"Alas, I understand him much better now,\\" she said, twenty years later. \\"... > but I think a lot of the things I've done since I've done out of a desire to > please Harry Hooton...\\"Christine Wallace, Untamed Shrew (1997) p. 94 While Hooton was living a very bohemian life in Sydney, he was connecting with literary people in Japan, India, Greece, South Africa, England, France, New Zealand, and the USA. Hooton had corresponded with counter-culture figures in California, and with Tuli Kupferberg who would later form the rock group The Fugs. He contributed to many periodicals and journals in addition to those he brought out himself. \\"He has published not only in Australia but in London, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, etc, and has had some material translated into Greek. He is far better known overseas than he is here\\". =Anarcho- technocracy= Hooton argued that man should have power over things, including machines, but never over other men, applying to himself the term \\"anarcho- technocrat\\". \\"He regarded the age of man as passed, and sees the age of the machine as the proper object of pursuit... In his quest for power over machines, Hooton is a technocrat, and in his opposition to power over men, he is an anarchist.\\" Hooton never completed his philosophical treatise, titled Militant Materialism, although he did complete six of its eight chapters. His ideas were magically simple. Leave man alone, man is perfect. Concentrate instead on matter. He formulated what he called Anarcho ‚Äì Technocracy : 'The Politics of Things'. Hooton saw proof copies of the last book published during his lifetime, It Is Great To Be Alive, published by Margaret Elliott (Margaret Fink), just before he died of cancer in 1961.

Farmersgolf (Boerengolf in Dutch) is a farm land game modelled after the sport of golf. It originated from a cheese farm run by Peter Weenink in Lievelde, a small village in the Achterhoek region of the Netherlands. It was invented out of frustration with costly golf course fees in the Netherlands, and with a test called the GVB (Golfvaardigheidsbewijs) which most Dutch courses require players to pass before being allowed to play. The first game was played in 1999, and since then games have also been played in Germany, Belgium, Sweden, France and Finland. There are currently about 70 farmers golf locations in the Netherlands, and over 110 Europe-wide. In 2005, over 10,000 people played the game on Weenink's course alone. Farmersgolf is played with a special wooden golf club, with a club head in the shape of a wooden shoe, or clog (in Dutch: klomp). A farmers golf ball is, with its 20 centimeter diameter, much larger than a traditional golf ball. A golf hole is made by placing a bucket in the ground and a flagpole beside it. The 8 to 10 holes have, on average, more than 200 meters distance between them. The defining feature of Farmersgolf is that the game is played on an otherwise unaltered farm. Obstacles and \\"hazards\\" include anything one might find on the farm, including live cows, ditches and barbed wire. The Farmersgolf name is trademarked in several countries and Weenink hopes to establish an international association that will raise the game to the level of serious sport.

He is notable for being the first Supreme Court Justice to hail from the state of Minnesota, and for being a Democrat appointed by a Republican president, Warren G. Harding. Early life and education Butler was born to Patrick and Mary Ann Butler, Catholic immigrants from County Wicklow, Ireland. (The pair met in Galena, Illinois, after having left the same part of Ireland because of the Great Famine.) Soon, the couple settled in Sciota, then Waterford, Dakota County, Minnesota. Their son Pierce was the sixth of nine children born in a log cabin; all but his sister would live to adulthood. Butler graduated from Carleton College, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He read for the law and was admitted to the bar in 1888. He married Annie M. Cronin in 1891. Career He was elected as county attorney in Ramsey County in 1892, and re-elected in 1894. Butler joined the law firm of How & Eller in 1896, which became How & Butler after the death of Homer C. Eller the following year. He accepted an offer to practice in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he took care of railroad- related litigation for James J. Hill. He was highly successful in representing railroads. In 1905 he returned to private practice and rejoined Jared How. He had also served as a lawyer for the company owned by his five brothers. In 1908, Butler was elected President of the Minnesota State Bar Association. From 1912 to 1922, he worked in railroad law in Canada, alternately representing the shareholders of railroad companies and the Canadian government; he produced favorable results for both. When he was nominated for the United States Supreme Court in 1922, Butler was in the process of winning approximately $12,000,000 for the Toronto Street Railway shareholders.  Nomination and confirmation  Justice Butler circa 1924 Although he was supported by Chief Justice and former President William Howard Taft, Butler's opposition to \\"radical\\" and \\"disloyal\\" professors at the University of Minnesota (where he had served on the Board of Regents) made him a controversial Supreme Court nominee when proposed by Republican President Warren Harding. The Senator-elect Henrik Shipstead of his home state opposed him, as did the Progressive Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin. Also against his confirmation were labor activists, some liberal magazines (The New Republic and The Nation) and the Ku Klux Klan because he was Catholic. However, with the support of prominent Roman Catholics, fellow lawyers (the Minnesota State Bar Association strongly endorsed him), and business groups (especially railroad companies), as well as Minnesota's other senator Knute Nelson, Butler was confirmed on Dec 21, 1922, by a margin of 61 to 8. The Senators who voted against him were five Democrats (Walter F. George, William J. Harris, J. Thomas Heflin, Morris Sheppard, and Park Trammell) and three Republicans (Robert M. La Follette Sr., Peter Norbeck, and George W. Norris). He took his seat on the Court on January 2, 1923. Court service thumb As an Associate Justice, Butler vigorously opposed regulation of business and the implementation of welfare programs by the federal government (as unconstitutional). During the Great Depression, he ruled against the constitutionality of many \\"New Deal\\" lawsthe Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the National Recovery Administrationwhich had been supported by his fellow Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. This earned him a place among the so-called \\"Four Horsemen,\\" which also included James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter. During his sixteen years on the bench, Justice Butler authored 327 majority opinions as well as 50 minority opinions. He wrote the majority opinion (6‚Äì3) in United States v. Schwimmer, in which the Hungarian immigrant's application for citizenship was denied because of her candid refusal to take an oath to \\"take up arms\\" for her adopted country. In Palko v. Connecticut, Butler was the lone dissenter on the court; the rest of the justices believed that a state was not restrained from trying a man a second time for the same crime. Butler believed this violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He sided with the majority in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, holding unconstitutional an Oregon state law which prohibited parents from sending their children to private or religious schools. In the 1927 decision for Buck v. Bell, Butler was the only Justice who dissented from the 8‚Äì1 rulingStephen Jay Gould, \\"Does the Stonless Plum Instruct the Thinking Reed,\\" in Dinosaur in a Haystack (1995) p. 287. and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s opinion holding that the forced sterilization of an allegedly \\"feeble-minded\\" woman in Virginia was constitutional. Holmes believed that Butler's religion influenced his thinking in Buck, remarking that \\"Butler knows this is good law, I wonder whether he will have the courage to vote with us in spite of his religion.\\" Although Butler dissented in both Buck and Palko, he did not write a dissenting opinion in either case; the practice of a Justice's noting a dissent without opinion was much more common then than it would be in the later 20th and early 21st centuries. Another consequential dissent was from the opinion expressed in Olmstead v. United States which upheld federal wiretapping. He took an expansive view of 4th Amendment protections. Death and legacy On November 15, 1939, Butler went into the hospital for \\"a minor ailment\\" but died in the early morning hours of November 16. He died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 73 while still on the court. He was the last serving Supreme Court Justice appointed by President Harding. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Paul..

It is a popular activity, and there are millions of boaters worldwide. Types of boats Boating on the Royal Military Canal at Hythe Recreational boats (sometimes called pleasure craft, especially for less sporting activities) fall into several broad categories, and additional subcategories. Broad categories include dinghies (generally under powered by sail, small engines, or muscle power), paddlesports boats (kayaks, rowing shells, canoes), runabouts ( powerboats with either outboard, sterndrive, or inboard engines), daysailers ( sailboats, frequently with a small auxiliary engine), cruisers ( powerboats with cabins), and cruising and racing sailboats ( sailboats with auxiliary engines). The National Marine Manufacturers Association, the organization that establishes several of the standards that are commonly used in the marine industry in the United States, defines 32 types of boats, demonstrating the diversity of boat types and their specialization. In addition to those standards all boats employ the same basic principles of hydrodynamics. Boating activities Yacht clubs and marinas are centers of boating activities ‚Äì Yacht Harbour Residence \\"Hohe D√ºne\\" in Rostock, Germany. Downeast style charter boat Wreck Valley Boating as a sport Boating activities are as varied as the boats and boaters who participate, and new ways of enjoying the water are constantly being discovered. Broad categories include the following: *Paddlesports include ears (lakes), swiftwater (rivers), and oceangoing types, usually covered-cockpit kayaks. **Canoes are popular on lakes and rivers due to their carrying capacity and efficiency on the water. They are also easy to portage, or carry overland around obstructions like rapids, or just down to the water from a car or cabin. **Kayaks can be found on calm inland waters, whitewater rivers, and along the coasts in the oceans. Known for their maneuverability and seaworthiness, kayaks take many shapes depending on their desired use. Rowing craft are also popular for fishing, as a tender to a larger vessel, or as a competitive sport. **Rowing shells are extremely long and narrow, and are intended to convert as much of the rower's muscle power as possible into speed. The ratio of length of waterline to beam has much importance in marine mechanics and design.. **Row boats or dinghies are oar powered, and generally restricted to protected waters. Rowboats are generally heavy craft compared to other has *Sailing can be either competitive, as in collegiate dinghy racing, or purely recreational as when sailing on a lake with family or friends. **Small sailboats also called dinghys are commonly made from fiberglass, and will have wood, aluminum, or carbon-fiber spars, and generally a sloop rig (two sails: a mainsail and a jib, commonly include 3rd sail the spinnaker for going downwind). Racing dinghies and skiffs tend to be lighter, have more sail area, and may use a trapeze to allow one or both crewmembers to suspend themselves over the water for additional stability. **Larger trailerable sailboats include trailer sailers, which have enclosed accommodation, and sportboats which are optimised for speed. **Daysailers tend to be wider across the beam and have greater accommodation space at the expense of speed. **Cruising sailboats have more width, but performance climbs as they tend to be much longer with a starting over-all length of at least re-balancing the dynamic ratio between length of waterline (aiding speed) and beam width (adding cargo and people space). *Freshwater fishing boats account for approximately 1/3 of all registered boats in the U.S., and most all other types of boats end up being used as fishing boats on occasion. The boating industry has developed freshwater fishing boat designs that are species-specific to allow anglers the greatest advantage when fishing for walleye, salmon, trout, bass, etcetera, as well as generic fishing craft. *Watersport Boats or skiboats are high-powered Go-Fast boats (specialized towboats in fact) is designed for activities where a participant is towed behind the boat such as waterskiing and parasailing. **Variations on the ubiquitous waterski include wakeboards, water-skiing, kneeboarding, inflatable towables, and wake surfing. To some degree, the nature of these boating activities influences boat design. Waterski boats are intended to hold a precise course at an accurate speed with a flat wake for slalom skiing runs. Wakeboard boats run at slower speeds, and have various methods including ballast and negative lift foils to force the stern in the water, thereby creating a large and \\"jumpable\\" wake. **Saltwater fishing boats vary widely in length and are once again specialized for various species of fish. Flats boats, for example, are used in protected, shallow waters, and have shallow draft. Sportfishing boats range from or more, and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Fishing boats in colder climates may have more space dedicated to cuddy cabins and wheelhouses, while boats in warmer climates are likely to be entirely open. **Cruising boats applies to both power and sailboats, and refers to trips from local weekend passages to lengthy voyages, and is a lifestyle. While faster \\"express cruisers\\" can be used for multiple day trips, long voyages generally require a slower displacement boat (trawler) with diesel power and greater stability and efficiency. Cruising sailboats range from and more, and have easily managed sail plans to allow relatively small crews to sail them long distances. Some cruising sailboats will have two masts (ketch, yawl, or schooner rigs) to further reduce the size of individual sails and make it possible for a couple to handle larger boats. Diesel- (now sometimes electric-) powered Narrowboats are a very popular mode of travel (and accommodation) on the inland waterways of England. *Racing and Regattas are common group activities in the sub- culture of boaters owning larger (twenty-five foot plus) small boats and larger Yachts, and are frequently organized around a Yacht club or Marina organization **Sailboat racing can be done on conventional family sailboats racing under one of the simpler handicap formulas (PHRF, or Performance Handicap Rating Formula is one such rule), or can be done on specialized boats with virtually no accommodation or compromises for comfort. Racing is generally either one design, where the boats are close to identical, or handicapped where the boats' finishing times are adjusted based on their predicted speed potential. Racing is further broken down into ocean racing, where boats start at one port and race in the ocean and back to the same port or a new destination, or buoy racing where boats race around prescribed courses and return to port at night. Several famous races cross oceans, like the biennial Transpac Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu, or the Newport- Bermuda Race from Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda. Other races actually circumnavigate the globe, like the Volvo Ocean Race or Vendee Globe race. Anchoring Anchoring a boat is essential to recreational boaters by giving them the ability to park their boat in the water. Anchoring is helpful to boaters who fish or swim off of their boat and provides a stable and established site to achieve whatever activity is being done. Anchoring a boat is also critical in emergency situations and is a good safety measure whenever a vessel becomes disabled. There are three types of anchors, the Plow-style, the Fluke-style, and the Mushroom anchor. *Plow-style is the most effective for most boats especially larger boats (over ). It receives its holding power by plowing into the bottom sediments using the boats mass to drag it underneath the soil. *Fluke-style or Danforth anchor is similar to the plow anchor but is more lightweight. This anchor is commonly used on boats smaller than but is very effective by using its pointed flukes to bury into the sediment below. *Mushroom anchors are designed for situations which require a permanent anchor with strong holding power. The weight of a mushroom anchor causes it to be slowly buried under soft sediment, giving significant holding power and are typically used for moorings, buoys, and other permanent anchoring needs. Mushroom anchors are not carried on a boat for use as a temporary or short term anchor. Initially there is no holding power due to the significant amount of time required for the anchor to settle and bury itself in the sediment. A rope anchor line should be at least seven times longer than the depth of the water in the anchorage. A seven to eight foot chain should also be attached between the rope and the anchor in order to reduce the angle of the pull on the anchor facilitated by the chain sinking and lying on the bottom. This is important because in order for the anchor to be effective, the pull must be at a shallow angle rather than vertically. A vertical pull on the anchor will result in the anchor breaking out of the bottom sediment and is used as a technique to break the anchor's hold allowing the anchor to be raised in order to leave the anchorage. The anchor should never be dragged behind a boat or dropped at the stern. This could result in the boat being swamped or filled with water. Tie off the anchor to a bow cleat and pull on it to make sure that the knot is secure. After that make sure the vessel is down wind or down current of the anchor. After anchoring it is important to check visual sightings and onshore objects or buoys to let the driver know if his boat is secure by the anchor. The anchor will help you to stay in your current position on the water. If used correctly it is a great tool to use while boating. Transport and storage Rack storage. The smallest boats and kayaks may simply be carried by hand or by lashing them to the top of an automobile. Most smaller boats are stored at home and carried to the water on boat trailers, where they are floated from launch ramps leading down into the water. Some marinas will also offer electric hoists that can lift a boat from a trailer and swing it into the water (generally less than 3 tons). Larger boats are kept at marinas, which offer a mooring protected from the weather and a variety of support services, such as fuel, equipment and so forth. A more recent form of storage is rack storage where runabouts are stored in large steel racks, sometimes four or five boats high, and perhaps 25 boats across. These racks are housed in sheds, and large specialized fork trucks are used to lift the boats from the racks and place them in the water. This reduces the amount of space needed for boat storage, and also provides a clean environment in which the boats are housed. Some marinas will offer dry storage yards, where boats on trailers or dollies are stored on a hard surface. Many yacht clubs will offer a fenced area where boats are conveniently stored near the water, but without the maintenance associated with continual water storage (bottom growth, etc.) Boats in dry storage areas are either ramp-launched or hoisted into the water. Safety Since it is a recreational activity, most boating is done in calm protected waters and during good weather. Even so, conditions can change rapidly, and a small vessel can get into life- threatening difficulties. It's important to keep an inventory of safety gear on board every boat, which is prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard as well as state boating law administrators in the U.S. Depending on the size of the boat and how it is powered, required equipment may include: * personal flotation devices (PFDs or life jackets) for everyone on board * a throwable flotation device (in the U.S., a Type IV PFD) * navigation lights suitable for the type of boat operation * visual distress signals (VSDs) which are effective both day and night * sound-making devices including horns and bells * fire * a copy of the Inland Rules of the Road Other items might seem obvious but are not actually required by law. They include a flashlight, first aid kit, paddles, whistles, anchor and rope, engine spare parts, bilge pumps, a VHF radio or mobile phone, etc. In addition to these safety items listed above, the Code of Federal Regulations lists some additional required items that may not fall into the common definition of \\"safety\\" items: * backfire arresters on gasoline-powered vessels * ventilation systems on gasoline-powered vessels * plaques which list the penalties associated with pollution due to oil discharge, or dumping trash overboard. * a marine sanitation system (MSD) which prevents water pollution from sewage State laws may add to this list of requirements. Most of the differences fall into a few categories: * laws requiring life jackets to be worn in specific activities or by children * upgraded life jackets for specific activities or by children * restrictions on the types of MSDs that are allowed within state borders In the United States, more than 40 states have educational requirements for operating a boat or PWC on state waters. Laws vary by state so it's best to check the laws of your state. Boater education courses can be taken in-person classroom style or online at the student's convenience. Credible courses are recognized by the US Coast Guard, approved by NASBLA and work in conjunction with state agencies. Commercial fisherman wearing a PFD with pockets among other safety equipment. Likely pocket contents: A whistle (on the lanyard, left side), dye packet, shark repellent, strobe light and pen knife. A mini-flare is clipped to the 'vest' on the user's left lapel. =PFD use= Recreational boating deaths could be dramatically reduced with increased use of Personal flotation devices (PFDs) or life jackets. Wear rates in 2003 were around 22.4%, although state and federal laws requiring children to wear flotation were more common, and therefore children's wear rates were much higher than those for adults. Relatively few children die in boating accidents; the more likely victim is an adult male in the mid-afternoon in a boat (under 20 feet length overall) who is not wearing a PFD. While various strategies have been devised in the last few decades to increase PFD wear rates, the observed rate has been relatively constant. This has led to the possibility of legislation requiring PFD usage on boats under a specified length when underway. Personal watercraft, or PWCs, have increased in popularity for the last 15 years, and account for about 70 fatalities per year (2002). However, PWC operators commonly wear PFDs, and therefore have a relatively low incidence of drowning. Trauma, largely due to collisions with other vessels and the shoreline, accounts for 70% of PWC fatalities while drowning accounts for about 30%. PFD types as defined by the U.S. Coast Guard such as Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV, and Type V can be found at the U.S. Coast Guard. In the U.S., one PFD MUST be available for everyone on board. Life jacket definitions for the UK Coast Guard. =Drowning= In the United States, approximately 700 people die every year as a result of recreational boating accidents, according to the Boating Accident Reporting Database, published annually by the U.S. Coast Guard. Alcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012. A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a \\"true figure\\" of alcohol-related deaths in that country \\"may lie between 46% and 56%\\". Since 1970, when recreational boating deaths in the U.S. peaked at about 1700 per year, the annual rate of fatalities has been declining at a rate of about 2% per year. The majority of these deaths (70%) occur due to drowning, and are frequently associated with small powerboat accidents. Other causes of death include trauma (especially with small powerboats), fire, carbon monoxide poisoning, and hypothermia. The cause of the reduction of deaths is subject to some debate, but the Federal Boat Safety Act in the 1970s required that boats under be equipped with level flotation. This change in boat construction meant that boaters who found themselves in the water next to a swamped boat could climb back into the boat and both reduce their likelihood of drowning, while increasing the size of a search target and reducing hypothermia. Other frequently named causes include improved boater safety education, increased use of life jackets, and improved boating safety gear. Another potential cause for drowning is the presence of stray electrical power from a boat leaking into the water. This is known as electric shock drowning. Metal surfaces of a boat leaking power into the water can create zones of high-energy potential. Stray current entering salt water is less of a problem than the same situation in fresh water. Salt water is a good conductor and it carries current away to ground quickly. Fresh water is a poor conductor and when alternating current forms an electrical potential near a boat, the current can paralyze a swimmer. Stray electric current has caused many drownings, but post-mortem examinations will not link this problem to the death. The problem can be reduced by prohibiting swimming near boats connected to shore power and ensuring marinas comply with National Fire Protection Association Standard 303 for marinas. =Carbon monoxide= In the early 2000s, several high-profile deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning (CO) led to increased scrutiny of boating habits (especially the practice of towing participants immediately behind a boat, known as \\"teak surfing\\" or \\"platform towing\\") and the implementation of various warning placards to educate boaters of the hazards arising from these activities. Other CO-related deaths were attributed to high concentrations of CO gas from houseboat generator exhaust, where swimmers were able to access an area near the stern of the boats that collected the exhaust. This has led to improved pollution controls on modern generator sets, and changes in the designs of houseboats so that they discharge exhaust gases in a way that they can dissipate. The increased use of CO detectors, especially in boats with enclosed accommodation spaces, and a proper assessment of boat manufacturers, would help reduce the risk of CO poisoning. Licensing Depending on the country, boating on coastal waters and inland waters may require a licence. Usually, commercially boating on coastal waters almost always requires a licence, while recreational boating on coastal waters only requires a licence when a certain boat size is exceeded (e.g. a length of 20 meters), or when passenger ships, ferries or tugboats are steered. Boating on international waters does not require any licence, due to the absence of any laws or restrictions in this area. Some of the member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe issue the International Certificate of Competence. The International Sailing License and Credentials (SLC) is a recreational sailing license valid for all yacht charter companies worldwide including Europe and the Seychelles.Online Sailing Certification See also *Boats *Boat building *Messabout *Pleasure craft *United States Coast Guard Auxiliary References * External links * Salt Water-Small Boating: 1700 miles up the coast by canoe, Long Island, N.Y. to Gooseberry, Labrador Manuscript at Dartmouth College Library Category:Nautical terminology Category:Vehicle operation Category:Water sports Category:Water transport ","title":"Boating"},{"id":"890489","text":"Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae.

The process was set up \\"to ensure that diamond purchases were not financing violence by rebel movements and their allies seeking to undermine legitimate governments.\\" The effectiveness of the process has been brought into question by organizations such as Global Witness (pulled out of the scheme on 5 December 2011) and IMPACT (pulled out on 14 December 2017), claiming it has failed in its purpose and does not provide markets with assurance that the diamonds are not conflict diamonds. Organisations such as Human Rights Watch have also argued that the Kimberley Process is too narrow in scope and does not adequately serve to eliminate other human rights concerns from the diamond production chain. History A man and two children sifting for diamonds in Sierra Leone. The United Nations imposed sanctions against UNITA in 1998 through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173, however investigators led by Robert Fowler presented the Fowler Report to the UN in March 2000, which detailed how the movement was able to continue financing its war efforts through the sale of diamonds on the international market. The UN wished to clamp down on this sanctions-breaking trade, but had limited powers of enforcement; the Fowler report therefore set out to name the countries, companies, government and individuals involved. This led to a meeting of Southern African diamond- producing states in Kimberley, Northern Cape in May 2000. A culminating ministerial meeting followed during September in Pretoria, from which the KPCS originated. In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/55/56, supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds, and this was followed by support from the United Nations Security Council in its Resolution 1459 passed in January 2003. Every year since, the General Assembly has renewed its support for the KP - most recently in March 2018. In order for a country to be a participant, it must ensure that any diamond originating from the country does not finance a rebel group or other entity seeking to overthrow a UN-recognized government, that every diamond export be accompanied by a Kimberley Process certificate and that no diamond is imported from, or exported to, a non-member of the scheme. This three-step plan is a simple description of the steps taken to ensure a chain of countries that deal exclusively with non-conflict diamonds. By restricting diamond revenues to government-approved sources, the Kimberley Process is neutral towards different governments. Compliance =System of warranties= The World Diamond Council created a System of Warranties for diamonds that has been endorsed by all KPCS participants. Under this system, all buyers and sellers of both rough and polished diamonds must make the following affirmative statement on all invoices: :‚ÄúThe diamonds herein invoiced have been purchased from legitimate sources not involved in funding conflict and in compliance with United Nations resolutions. The seller hereby guarantees that these diamonds are conflict free, based on personal knowledge and/or written guarantees provided by the supplier of these diamonds.‚Äù It is considered a violation of the KPCS to issue a warranty declaration on a sales invoice unless it can be corroborated by warranty invoices received for purchases. Each company trading in diamonds must also keep records of the warranty invoices received and the warranty invoices issued when buying or selling diamonds. This flow of warranties in and out must be audited and reconciled on an annual basis by the company's auditors. In addition, the diamond industry organizations and their members have adopted the following principles of self-regulation: * to trade only with companies that include warranty declarations on their invoices; * to not buy diamonds from suspect sources or unknown suppliers, or which originate in countries that have not implemented the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme; * to not buy diamonds from any sources that, after a legally binding due process system, have been found to have violated government regulations restricting the trade in conflict diamonds; * to not buy diamonds in or from any region that is subject to an advisory by a governmental authority indicating that conflict diamonds are emanating from or available for sale in such region, unless diamonds have been exported from such region in compliance with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme; * to not knowingly buy or sell or assist others to buy or sell conflict diamonds; * to ensure that all company employees that buy or sell diamonds within the diamond trade are well informed regarding trade resolutions and government regulations restricting the trade in conflict diamonds. Failure to abide by these principles exposes the member to expulsion from industry organizations. Working procedure The working procedure of the KPCS is done by the chair, elected on an annual basis at a plenary meeting. A working group on monitoring, works to ensure that each participant is implementing the scheme correctly. The working group reports to the Chair. Other working groups include the technical working group (or working group of diamond experts) which reports on difficulties in implementation and proposes solutions, and the statistics working group, which reports diamond trading data. While the Process has been broadly welcomed by groups aiming to improve human rights in countries previously affected by conflict diamonds, such as Angola, some say it does not go far enough. For instance, Amnesty International says \\"[We] welcome the Kimberley Process as an important step to dealing with the problem of conflict diamonds. But until the diamond trade is subject to mandatory, impartial monitoring, there is still no effective guarantee that all conflict diamonds will be identified and removed from the market.\\" Canadian aid group One Sky (funded in part by the Canadian government) concurs with Amnesty's view saying \\"If effectively implemented, the Kimberley Process will ensure that diamonds cannot be used to finance war and atrocities... However, without a system of expert, independent and periodic reviews of all countries, the overall process remains open to abuse.\\" Fatal Transactions campaign's (started in 1998) founder Anne Jung in 2008 criticized KPCS for not being a legally binding agreement and suggested a revision of the scheme. Another form of criticism by the African Diamond Council (ADC) is whether the Kimberley Process is realistically enforceable. There are many factors that can jeopardize the \\"Officialdom of certificates and paperwork\\" from lack of enforcement on the ground to the secrecy in the diamond trading centers such as Antwerp. Human Rights Watch has also found that there is little independent monitoring of compliance with the Kimberley Process, and few penalties for violations. =Working groups= KPCS has established a number of working groups for carrying out its programs. As of 2019, it had 7 working groups: Working Group of Diamond Experts (WGDE), Working Group on Monitoring (WGM), Working Group on Statistics (WGS), Working Group on Artisanal & Alluvial Production (WGAAP), Committee on Participation and Chairmanship (CPC), Committee on Rules and Procedures (CRP) and Ad Hoc Committee on Reform and Review (AHCRR). Current membership As of 1 July 2013, there were 54 participants in the KPCS representing 81 countries, with the European Union counting as a single participant. The participants include all major rough diamond producing, exporting and importing countries. Cameroon, Kazakhstan, Panama, and Cambodia were admitted as participants in 2012. The following is a list of participant countries with their year of entry (and re-entry, as appropriate) in brackets. * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2006) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2012) * (2012) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2011) * (2018) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2005) * (2003) * (2003) * (2012) * (2003) * (2003/2005) * (2003) * (2007) * (2003) * (2013) * (2003) * (2008) * (2003) * (2006) * (2003) * (2012) * (2003/2007) * (2003) * (2003) * (2004) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2007) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003) * (2003, withdrew in 2008, re-admitted in 2016) * (2003) * (2003) =Applicants= The following countries have expressed interest in joining the KPCS, but have yet to satisfy the minimum requirements:    =Waiver= The World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2006 approved a waiver for the KPCS while recognizing the importance and effectiveness of the KPCS. Chairs The following is a list of the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme's chairs and vice chairs. The Chair oversees the implementation of the program, the operations of the working groups and committees, and general administration. The Chair rotates annually. The current chair of KPCS is the nation that held the position of vice chair the previous year. * 2003: South Africa; vice chair Canada * 2004: Canada; vice chair Russian Federation * 2005: Russian Federation; vice chair Botswana * 2006: Botswana; vice chair European Commission * 2007: European Commission; vice chair India * 2008: India; vice chair Namibia * 2009: Namibia; vice chair Israel * 2010: Israel, Mr. Boaz Hirsch; vice chair DRC * 2011: DRC, Mr. Mathieu Yamba; vice chair United States * 2012: United States, Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic; vice chair South Africa * 2013: South Africa, vice chair China * 2014: China, vice chair Angola * 2015: Angola, vice chair United Arab Emirates * 2016: United Arab Emirates, vice chair Australia * 2017: Australia, vice chair European Union * 2018: European Union, vice chair India * 2019: India, vice chair Russian Federation * 2020: Russian Federation, vice chair Botswana The DRC's position as the 2011 KPCS Chair is notable, in that it had been a known source of conflict diamonds and other minerals in recent years. Statistics KPCS emphasizes collecting and publishing data relating to actual mining and international trade in diamonds. Member countries are required to officially submit statistics that can be verified through audit. Also, all member countries are required to produce and submit an Annual Report on the trade in diamonds. According to the Working Group on Statistics (WGS) of KPCS, in 2006, the KPCS monitored $35.7 billion in rough diamond exports representing more than 480 million carats. The number of Certificates issued by KPCS members was 55,000. In 2014, 100 Reporters published an article showing how the use of KP certificates had allowed for the publication to identify transfer pricing manipulation in South Africa's trade of rough diamond exports, detailing \\"Most imported diamonds appear to be re-exported uncut and unpolished. While imports make up relatively small volume, or carats, they drastically increase the value of rough diamond exports. Subtracting the values and volume of imported diamonds shown on South Africa‚Äôs K.P. certificates from corresponding exports, the actual price per carat of rough diamonds being exported for the first time falls dramatically.\\" The article revealed that when, \\"asked about the anomalies in reported trade figures for diamonds under the Kimberley Process (K.P.) in South Africa, where De Beers is a dominant player, [Lynette] Gould, [head of media relations for De Beers], responded, ‚ÄúThe primary purpose of the K.P. process (or the issuing of the certificates at least) is for Governments to certify the origin of diamonds, not to keep track of the volume and value of diamonds imported or exported.\\" =Annual report= Annual report by all KPCS members is a component of peer review mechanism established by KPCS. In the United States, for example, all companies that buy, sell, and ship rough diamonds must submit an annual report via email to the State Department, deadline April 1. The report must include the company's contact information and a detailed breakdown of the total carat weight and value in U.S. dollars of rough diamonds imported, exported, and stockpiled (still in inventory) for the previous calendar year. These are also sorted by HTS codes for unsorted (gem and industrial) rough diamonds, sorted rough industrial diamonds, and sorted rough gem diamonds‚Äîthe latter of which is most likely to be polished into finished stones and jewelry for retail sale, while industrial diamonds are most likely to be used in cutting and drilling tools. Failure to submit this annual report in a timely fashion could result in a fine up to $10,000. If found to be in willful violation, the convicted offender could be fined up to $50,000 and sentenced to jail time up to ten years. Expulsion In 2004, Republic of the Congo was removed from the scheme because it was found unable to prove the origin of its gems, most of which were believed to have come from the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. For countries economically dependent on diamond exports, this can be a substantial punishment, as it disallows trade with much of the rest of the world. Republic of the Congo's membership in the KPCS was reinstated in the Plenary of 2007. In 2005, trade in diamonds from C√¥te d'Ivoire was prohibited. Ivorian diamonds and cocoa are considered conflict resources. In 2008, Venezuela voluntarily removed itself from the KPCS, after it had been in non-compliance for several years. The nation ignored several attempts to communicate from Kimberley working groups, finally responding to an Angolan ambassador in 2007. Venezuela invited Kimberley officials to visit the nation, but this required authorization, and the deadline expired without further correspondence. Finally, Venezuela agreed to remove itself from the KPCS and work toward strengthening its infrastructure. C√¥te d'Ivoire and Venezuela are still considered Kimberley Process members, but not Kimberley Process participants. As explained in the FAQ section of the Kimberley Process website, \\"Participants in the Kimberley Process (KP) are states or regional economic integration organisations (currently the European Community) that have met the minimum requirements of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) and are, therefore, eligible to trade in rough diamonds with one another. The KPCS prohibits participants from trading with non-participants. Therefore, while the aforementioned countries still retain membership in the KPCS, they do not fulfill the requirements for participation, and thus cannot be called \\"participants.\\" Global Witness Global Witness is a London-based NGO, a key member of the KPCS and was one of the first organizations to bring the issue of 'conflict diamonds' to international attention. They state that a report they wrote, \\"A Rough Trade,\\" was partial inspiration for the film Blood Diamond. According to Global Witness, the Kimberley Process has ultimately failed to stem the flow of conflict diamonds, leading them to abandon the scheme in 2011. Criticism In December 2013, the World Policy Journal published an investigative report by journalists Khadija Sharife and John Grobler. This showed that a minimum of $3.5 billion in KP-certified diamonds from Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had been moved through KP-certified tax havens such as Dubai and Switzerland. This was in collaboration with self- regulating 'KP-approved' governments including Angola; arms dealers such as Arkadi Gaydamak, diamond magnate Lev Leviev and certain international banks. The authors concluded that tax havens should not be allowed to handle resource revenues because they provide: \\"the legal and financial-secrecy infrastructure enabling illicit activities, while the former struggle to generate revenue for citizens‚Äô needs.\\" Under-invoicing and other illicit manipulation of reported income or tax avoidance were excluded from the definition of 'conflict diamond' used by the KP, they note, and this \\"has enabled a 99 percent clean diamond industry to exist largely because the real violence of the industry is whitewashed, ignored, or excluded entirely from the framework‚Äîthe criminal portion of which continues to exist entirely on the periphery.\\" In 2013, US investigative platform 100 Reporters released another Khadija Sharife investigate through Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) documents, showing $3 billion in diamond revenues used to rig the Zimbabwean elections. In June 2009, Ian Smillie of the Canadian-based NGO, Partnership Africa Canada\\"PAC\\", Partenariat Afrique Canada. (PAC), one of the founder members of the Kimberley Process resigned his position accusing the regulator of failing to regulate and saying he could no longer contribute to the \\"pretense that failure is success\\". Another founding member of the process, UK-based NGO Global Witness said, \\"Despite having all tools in place, the Scheme was failing effectively to address issues of non-compliance, smuggling, money laundering and human rights abuses in the world's... diamond fields\\". The scheme came under further criticism from Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada in June 2010 after the Kimberley Monitor appointed to review diamond mining conditions in Zimbabwe recommended that the country be allowed to sell diamonds as conflict- free from its contested Marange diamond fields in Chiadzwa. For the first time the two NGOs jointly called for a redefined classification for conflict diamonds. In August 2010, another key draftsman of the KP, and also Africa's highest-ranking diamond official, African Diamond Council (ADC) and ADPA chairman Dr. Andr√© A. Jackson, demoralized KP supporters by persuading African diamond-producing nations to renounce their support for the scheme. Jackson blasted the KP for its ongoing ineffectiveness, stating that ‚Äúthe system has failed to thwart trading of diamonds mined as a result of human suffering.‚Äù Ahead of this denunciation, the ADC unleashed a distressing TV infomercial that exposed internal problems at the front end of the African diamond industry. The broadcast was not only a huge boost for the ADC, it proved to be an enormous setback for the Kimberley Process and ultimately ended De Beers‚Äô ascendancy on the African continent. In December 2010 Time Magazine published a piece discussing the newly established rough diamond trade in Zimbabwe. The article questioned the legitimacy of the Kimberley Process, stating that it was unable to prevent Zimbabwean conflict diamonds from entering the market. On 11 August 2011, a BBC radio documentary titled \\"Zimbabwe's Diamond Fields\\" repeated an interview with representatives of the Kimberley Process claiming officials were unaware of the tortures and killings exposed in the documentary. Official stated they were only aware of incidents uncovered by their brief visits to the field, implying that they were not staffed to do in- depth investigations. The certification scheme lost a large amount of its integrity after Global Witness walked out on KP in December 2011. The human rights watchdog group has stated that in recent times, the governments of Zimbabwe, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Venezuela have all dishonored, breached and exploited the system without bearing any consequential penalties for their infringements.

During his time in the Majors, he once led the National League in stolen bases, and was among the seasonal leaders in several other offensive categories including home runs, and batting average. Lange was noted for having a combination of great speed and power, especially for his size. His , frame was considered large for his era.Snyder, p. 101 He is best known for retiring from baseball during the prime of his career to get married, as his future father-in-law forbade his daughter to marry a baseball player. Despite the short-lived marriage, he refused all offers to return as a player. He became a successful businessman after his retirement from baseball. In addition to his success in real estate and insurance, he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball's efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide. He was enlisted by the leading baseball figures of the day to assist in establishing leagues in several European countries, that could eventually compete against American teams, while also scouting for undiscovered talent. Early life Born in the Presidio DistrictNelson, p. 51 of San Francisco, California, he ran away from home while still in grammar school to live with his brother in Port Townsend, Washington. It was from there that he moved up to play Minor League Baseball for the Seattle Reds of the Northwestern Baseball League in the early 1890s. When the Northwestern League folded, Lange return the Bay area to play for the Oakland Colonels of the California League.Nelson, p. 52 He played one season for the Colonels, then was signed by the Chicago Colts of the National League. Major League career Lange made his Major League debut on April 27, for the Colts, and enjoyed a successful inaugural Major League season. He scored 92 times, hit eight home runs, had 88 runs batted in (RBIs), while also finishing seventh in stolen bases with 47, and batted .281. This was the only time he batted under .300 during his Major League career. In the field that season, he played at second base, in right field and center field. He did not start playing center field exclusively until the following season. Lange continued his success in by raising his batting average to .328 and finishing fifth in the league with 65 stolen bases. Lange achieved his highest league rankings in . His .389 batting average was fifth in the league and is still the top individual season average in Chicago Cubs's history.Snyder, p. 86 He also finished second in the league in stolen bases with 67, fifth in home runs with 10, fifth in on-base percentage with .456, hit 16 triples, scored 120 runs, and batted in 98 RBIs. Lange had several notable moments during the season. On July 4, he stole five bases in one game against the Louisville Colonels,Snyder, p. 89 although it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by George Gore and Billy Hamilton. During a game on August 31, he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed. The game was scoreless in the bottom of the 10th inning when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless. Later in the inning, Chicago's first baseman, George Decker attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman Barry McCormick, but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead. In an effort to get Decker to the hospital adjacent the ballpark, his teammates knocked down several wooden slats of the outfield fence to expedite his journey. However, the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed through the fence making that acrobatic catch in tenth.Snyder, p. 90 Lange finished the season with a .326 batting average, while also stealing 84 bases, second in the league, and finished eighth in league with 16 triples. His success continued into the season, as he batted .340, scored 119 runs, and led the league in stolen bases for the only time in his career. His production dropped his last two seasons in the Majors as his runs scored fell to 79 in and 81 in , although he still kept his batting averages of .319 and .325 respectively. While he was very popular, his career as a baseball player was not without controversy. He was ejected from a game on at least two occasions, one of which occurred on May 23, when he had an on-field fight with Washington Senators second baseman John O'Brien.Snyder, p. 91 On September 16, 1899, in a game against the Brooklyn Superbas, umpire Ed Swartwood called the game because of darkness with Brooklyn up by two runs. Lange, and other Chicago player surrounded Swartwood and proceeded to \\"knock him around\\", with Lange notably \\"tweaking\\" the umpire's ear.Snyder, p. 198 Retirement Lange finished his career on October 15, 1899, having announced a few days earlier his intention to retire after the season. His team played a doubleheader that day, winning 7-0 against the St. Louis Perfectos, then losing to the Louisville Colonels later that day in a game shortened by darkness. He retired from the game at age 28, during the prime of his career, so he could marry a woman whose father forbade her to marry a baseball player. In the eyes of the 19th century public, baseball players were popular, but were often looked upon as low class. Lange's future wife was from his hometown of San Francisco, and her family was very well-to-do. Also, with the prospect of entering into the world of real estate and insurance, he could make much more money than he did as a ball player.Nelson, p. 56 Though the marriage ended in a divorce a short time later, he would not take any offers to return to Major League Baseball, despite Chicago's salary offer of $3,500 that would have made him the highest paid player in the league. Although his career lasted only seven years, he finished as the decade leader among 1890s Chicago players in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and stolen bases.Snyder, p. 64 In 813 games over seven seasons, Lange posted a .330 batting average (1056-for-3202) with 691 runs, 39 home runs, 579 RBI, 400 stolen bases and 350 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .932 fielding percentage. Post-career Lange became successful in both real estate and insurance in his hometown of San Francisco after he retired from baseball. Lange is also credited in several sources, as being the person who discovered future Chicago Cubs first baseman, manager, and Hall of Famer, Frank Chance, after having watched him play for the local Fresno, California team during the off-season of 1897. Lange had recommended Chance to the team owner, Jim Hart, but Hart disputed this claim, saying that Henry Harris had recommended Chance to him while Harris was an owner of a San Francisco team in the fall of 1897.Simon, p. 91 In , the California State League, a minor league, was declared by organized baseball to be an \\"outlaw\\" league. Organized baseball accused the league of harboring players from the Majors Leagues who had violated the reserve clause to join a number of their teams. The league had become a rival to the already established Pacific Coast League (PCL), who, after being an \\"outlaw\\" league themselves, had signed the National Agreement with organized baseball, agreeing that they would not harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues. A national commission decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to dissolve this outlaw league. They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League, which would create competition among all known leagues, for these players. This commission enlisted Lange, who used his influence with the sports editors in the local area to speed up the process. The attempt worked as the PCL successfully lured the Sacramento, California team into joining their league, with many of the players soon to follow. Later, John McGraw of the New York Giants enlisted Lange as his chief European baseball scout, hoping to discover any hidden talent in that untapped market. In , Ban Johnson, the American League president enlisted Lange as his chief organizer of baseball teams in Europe, mainly in England, France, Belgium, and Italy. Johnson's plan was for Lange to evaluate talent and establish an International Baseball League that could compete against the American League pennant winning team in an effort to generate greater interest in the game. Lange became part of the board of directors at the YMCA, which helped fund the expedition. Additionally, Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith donated $40,000 worth of equipment to assist in supplying the new league. Lange died at the age of 79 in his hometown of San Francisco, and is interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. Two of his nephews played Major League ball as well, Ren, and George \\"Highpockets\\" Kelly. George later gained induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in .

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 8, 2011 is a major stream of north-central Tennessee and south-central Kentucky, and a major tributary of the Cumberland River. It rises in Sumner County, Tennessee, south of Portland. Trending generally northwest, it is crossed by several roads, notably State Route 76, U.S. Route 31W, and Interstate 65. A major tributary, the South Fork, forms nearby and runs parallel and south of the main river for several miles. For almost its entire length, it drains the northern Highland Rim of Tennessee and the adjacent (and analogous) Pennyroyal Plateau of Kentucky. The Red River crosses briefly into Simpson County, Kentucky, and then enters Logan County, Kentucky. The South Fork also crosses into Logan County, coming from Robertson County, Tennessee, and joining the Red west of Adairville. Crossing the state line into Robertson County, the Red continues to flow primarily westward but with minor meanders. Crossed by U.S. Highway 41 near Adams, Tennessee, it is joined by an important tributary, Sulphur Fork, at the historic site of Port Royal, now a designated Tennessee State Historic Area. Tobacco was at one time loaded here onto shallow-draught boats, and a covered bridge crossed here. (The original covered bridge washed away in a flood, as a rebuilt replica also did subsequently.) The Red River and Sulphur Fork both form a small portion of the Robertson County-Montgomery County line, and the confluence at Port Royal marks a major jog in this line. Flowing toward the Montgomery County seat of Clarksville, the stream is crossed by Interstate 24. It formerly marked the boundary between Clarksville and the adjoining community of New Providence; New Providence has long been annexed into Clarksville and is now regarded as a neighborhood of Clarksville, not a separate community. About above its mouth into the Cumberland, the Red River is joined by the West Fork of the Red River, its last tributary, which drains eastern Christian County and western Todd County, Kentucky. It is crossed by U.S. Route 41 Alternate just before its confluence with the Cumberland. The stream's name derives from its typical water color. This is caused by a large load of clay and silt which contains iron oxides. As the area drained by the Red River becomes somewhat less agricultural and more of the remaining farmers switch to techniques involving less cultivation, it is likely that this color will continue to lessen in intensity, but certainly will not vanish. The drainage basin around the Red River is the Red River Watershed. The entire watershed collects rain from an area large. Attractions The Red River Meeting House stands near the section of Red River that flows through Logan County. This meeting house was the site of one of the early revivals of the Second Great Awakening, a religious movement that swept over the United States near the turn of the 19th century. Red River Canoe, located in Adams, TN is known for its shallow slow moving current with canoes and kayaks to rent. A place of interest is the Bell Witch Cave, which is located on the left-hand side of the river.

The earliest use of the nameMerriam-Webster Dictionary: \\"Matins\\" was in reference to the canonical hour, also called the vigil, which was originally celebrated by monks from about two hours after midnight to, at latest, the dawn, the time for the canonical hour of lauds (a practice still followed in certain orders). It was divided into two or (on Sundays) three nocturns. Outside of monasteries, it was generally recited at other times of the day, often in conjunction with lauds. In the Byzantine Rite these vigils correspond to the aggregate comprising the midnight office, orthros, and the first hour. In a later use, especially in Anglican tradition, the hour of matins (also spelled mattins) is morning prayer. Lutherans preserve recognizably traditional matins distinct from morning prayer, but \\"matins\\" is sometimes used in other Protestant denominations to describe any morning service.  Roman Rite  = \\"Vigil\\" = The every-night monastic canonical hour that later became known as matins was at first called a \\"vigil\\", from Latin vigilia. For soldiers, this word meant a three-hour period of being on the watch during the night. Even for civilians, night was commonly spoken of as divided into four such watches: the Gospels use the term when recounting how, at about \\"the fourth watch of the night\\", Jesus came to his disciples who in their boat were struggling to make headway against the wind,; and one of the Psalms says to the Lord: \\"A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.\\" The sixth-century Rule of Saint Benedict uses the term vigiliae (\\"vigils\\") fifteen times to speak of these celebrations, accompanying it four times with the adjective nocturnae (\\"nocturnal\\") and once with the words septem noctium (\\"of the seven nights\\", i.e., the nights of the week).Regula S.P.N. Benedicti English versions of this document often obscure its use of the term \\"vigil\\", translating it as \\"Night Hour\\" or \\"Night Office\\". Thus Leonard J. Doyle's English version uses \\"Night Office\\" to represent indifferently the unaccompanied noun vigilia (\\"vigil\\"), the phrase nocturna vigilia (\\"night vigil\\"), and the phrases nocturna hora (\\"night hour) and nocturna laus (\\"nocturnal praise\\").St Benedict's Rule for Monasteries; cf. another translation; Paul Delatte, Rule of St. Benedict: A Commentary (Ravenio Books 2014) The practice of rising for prayer in the middle of the night is as old as the Church.Benedictine Monks of Buckfast Abbey, \\"Divine Office: Matins ‚Äî Prayer at Night\\", Homiletic and Pastoral Review, pp.361-367, Joseph F. Wagner, Inc., New York, NY, January 1925 Tertullian (c. 155 ‚Äì c. 240) speaks of the \\"nocturnal convocations\\" (nocturnae convocationes) of Christians and their \\"absence all the night long at the paschal solemnities\\" (sollemnibus Paschae abnoctantes)Tertullian, Ad uxorem, II,4 ; Latin text Cyprian (c. 200 ‚Äì 258) also speaks of praying at night, but not of doing so as a group: \\"Let there be no failure of prayers in the hours of night ‚Äî no idle and reckless waste of the occasions of prayer\\" (nulla sint horis nocturnis precum damna, nulla orationum pigra et ignava dispendia).Cyprian, De oratione dominica, 36 (near end); Latin text The Apostolic Tradition speaks of prayer at midnight and again at cockcrow, but seemingly as private, not communal, prayer.Robert F. Taft, The Liturgy of the Hours in East and West: The Origins of the Divine Office and Its Meaning for Today (Liturgical Press 1986), pp. 25‚Äì26 At an earlier date, Pliny the Younger reported in about 112 that Christians gathered on a certain day before light, sang hymns to Christ as to a god and shared a meal.Pliny, Letters 10.96-97 The solemn celebration of vigils in the churches of Jerusalem in the early 380s is described in the Peregrinatio Aetheriae. Prayer at midnight and at cockcrow was associated with passages in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark.Taft (1986), p. 35 On the basis of the Gospel of Luke, too, prayer at any time of the night was seen as having eschatological significance.Taft (1986), p. 15 The quotation from Tertullian above refers to the all-night vigil service held at Easter. A similar service came to be held in the night that led to any Sunday. By the fourth century this Sunday vigil had become a daily observance, but no longer lasted throughout the night. What had been an all-night vigil became a service only from cockcrow to before dawn.Lallou, William J. \\"Introduction to the Roman Breviary\\", Roman Breviary In English, Benziger Brothers, Inc, 1950 Saint Benedict wrote about it as beginning at about 2 in the morning (\\"the eighth hour of the night\\") and ending in winter well before dawn (leaving an interval in which the monks were to devote themselves to study or meditation),Rule of Saint Benedict, 8 but having to be curtailed in summer in order to celebrate lauds at daybreak.Rule of Saint Benedict, 10 = \\"Matins\\" = The word \\"matins\\" is derived from Latin adjective matutinus, meaning \\"of or belonging to the morning\\".Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary It was at first applied to the psalms recited at dawn, but later became attached to the prayer originally offered, according to the fourth-century Apostolic Constitutions, at cockcrow\\"Offer up your prayers in the morning, at the third hour, the sixth, the ninth, the evening, and at cock-crowing\\" (Constitutions of the Holy Apostles , VIII, iv, 34) and, according to the sixth-century Rule of Saint Benedict, at could be calculated to be the eighth hour of the night (the hour that began at about 2 a.m.).Rule of Saint Benedict, 8Delatte, Commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict (Wipf and Stock 1922), p. 141 Between the vigil office and the dawn office there was in the long winter nights there was an interval, which \\"should be spent in study by those [monks] who need a better knowledge of the Psalter or the lessons\\"; in the summer nights the interval was short, only enough for the monks to \\"go out for the necessities of nature\\".Rule of Saint Benedict, 8Paul Delatte, Commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict (Wipf and Stock 1922), p. 157 The vigil office was also shortened in the summer months by replacing readings with a passage of scripture recited by heart, but keeping the same number of psalms. Both in summer and in winter the vigil office was longer than on other days, with more reading and the recitation of canticles in addition to the psalms.Rule of Saint Benedict, 10‚àí11 Outside of monasteries few rose at night to pray. The canonical hour of the vigil was said in the morning, followed immediately by lauds, and the name of \\"matins\\" became attached to the lengthier part of what was recited at that time of the day, while the name of \\"lauds\\", a name originally describing only the three Psalms 148‚àí150 recited every day at the end of the dawn office (until excised in the 1911 reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X; see Lauds), was applied to the whole of that office, substituting for the lost name of \\"matins\\" or variants such as laudes matutinae (morning praises) and matutini hymni (morning hymns). An early instance of the application of the named \\"matins\\" to the vigil office is that of the Council of Tours in 567, which spoke of ad matutinum sex antiphonae.Fernand Cabrol, \\"Matins\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 10 (New York 1911); The Rule of Saint Benedict clearly distinguished this one nighttime hour, to which he applied Psalm 118/119:62, \\"At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules\\",Psalm 119:62 from the seven daytime hours, including matutini (matins, the hour of the morning psalms at dawn), which he associated with Psalm 118/119:164, \\"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous rules\\".Psalm 119:164Rule of Saint Benedict, 16 The word \\"vigil\\" also took on a different meaning: no longer a prayerful watch at night before a religious feast, but the day before a feast.Oxford English DictionariesMerriam-Webster = Monastic matins = The canonical hour began with the versicles, \\"O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me\\" and \\"O Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise\\" (the latter said three times) followed by Psalm 3 and Psalm 94/95 (the Invitatory). The Invitatory was to be recited slowly out of consideration for any late-arriving monk, since anyone appearing after its conclusion was punished by having to stand in a place apart.Rule of Saint Benedict, 43 After this a hymn was sung. Next came two sets of six psalms followed by readings. (Such sets would later be called nocturns.) The first set was of six psalms followed by three readings from the Old or New Testaments or from Church Fathers. Each reading was followed by a responsory. The second set of six psalms was followed by a passage from the Apostle Paul recited by heart and by some prayers. The Night Office then concluded with a versicle and a litany that began with Kyrie eleison.Rule of St Benedict, 9‚Äì10 Since summer nights are shorter, from Easter to October a single passage from the Old Testament, recited by heart, took the place of the three readings used during the rest of the year.Rule of Saint Benedict, 10 On Sundays, the office was longer, and therefore began a little earlier. Each set of six psalms was followed by four readings instead of three after the first set and a single recitation by heart after the second set. Then three canticles taken from Old Testament books other than the Psalms were recited, followed by four readings from the New Testament, the singing of the Te Deum, and a reading by the abbot from the Gospels, after which another hymn was sung.Rule of Saint Benedict, 11 = Roman Breviary matins = In the Roman Breviary, use of which was made obligatory throughout the Latin Church (with exceptions for forms of the Liturgy of the Hours that could show they had been in continuous use for at least two hundred years) by Pope Pius V in 1568, matins and lauds were seen as a single canonical hour, with lauds as an appendage to matins.John Henry Newman, On the Roman Breviary as embodying the substance of the devotional services of the Church Catholic (Tracts for the Times, 75), p. 19 Its matins began, as in the monastic matins, with versicles and the invitatory Psalm 94 (Psalm 95 in the Masoretic text) chanted or recited in the responsorial form, that is to say, by one or more cantors singing one verse, which the choir repeated as a response to the successive verses sung by the cantors. A hymn was then sung. After that introduction, Sunday matins had three sections (\\"nocturns\\"), the first with 12 psalms and 3 very short scriptural readings; the second with 3 psalms and 3 equally short patristic readings; and the third with 3 psalms and 3 short extracts from a homily. Matins of feasts of double or semidouble rank had 3 nocturns, each with 3 psalms and 3 readings.Rubricae Generales Breviarii, I,5; II,4 On a feast of simple rank, a feria or a vigil day, matins had 12 psalms and 3 readings with no division into nocturns.Rubricae Generales Breviarii, III,4; V,3; VI,4Breviarium Romanum (Dessain 1861), as an example of a volume of the Roman Breviary The psalms used at matins in the Roman Breviary from Sunday to Saturday were Psalms 1‚àí108/109 in consecutive order, omitting a few that were reserved for other canonical hours: Psalms 4, 5, 21/22‚àí25/26, 41/42, 50/51, 53/54, 62/63, 66/67, 89/90‚àí92/93.List of psalms in the Pius V and the Pius X matins The consecutive order was not observed for the invitatory psalms, recited every day, and in the matins of feasts. Each reading was followed by a responsory, except the last one, when this was followed by the Te Deum. = 20th-century changes = Matins underwent profound changes in the 20th century. The first of these changes was the reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X in 1911, resulting in what Pope Paul VI called \\"a new Breviary\\".Apostolic Constitution Laudis Canticum The reservation of Psalms 1-108/109 to matins and the consecutive order within that group were abandoned, and, apart from the invitatory psalm, which continued in its place at matins every day, no psalm was ordinarily repeated within the same week. To facilitate an even distribution among the days of the week, the longer psalms were divided into shorter portions, as only the very long Psalm 118/119 had been previously. Matins no longer had 18 psalms on Sundays, 12 on ordinary days and 9 on the more important feasts: on every day it had 9 psalms, either distributed among three nocturns or recited all together, maintaining the distinction between celebrations as three nocturns with nine readings (including Sundays) and those arranged as a single nocturn with only three readings. In 1947, Pope Pius XII entrusted examination of the whole question of the Breviary to a commission which conducted a worldwide consultation of the Catholic bishops. He authorized recitation of the psalms in a new Latin translation and in 1955 ordered a simplification of the rubrics. In 1960, Pope John XXIII issued his Code of Rubrics, which assigned nine-readings matins only to first-class and second-class feasts and therefore reduced the readings of Sunday matins to three.1960 Code of Rubrics, 161‚àí163 In 1970, Pope Paul VI published a revised form of the Liturgy of the Hours, in which the psalms were arranged in a four-week instead of a one-week cycle, but the variety of other texts was greatly increased, in particular the scriptural and patristic readings, while the hagiographical readings were purged of non-historical legendary content.Laudis canticum, criteria 3‚àí7 What had previously been called matins was given the name of \\"office of readings\\" (officium lectionis) and was declared appropriate for celebrating at any hour, while preserving its nocturnal character for those who wished to celebrate a vigil.Laudis canticum, criterion 2 For that purpose alternative hymns are provided and an appendix contains material, in particular canticles and readings from the Gospels, to facilitate celebration of a vigil. The Catholic Church has thus restored to the word \\"vigil\\" the meaning it had in early Christianity. Pope John XIII's Code of Rubrics still used the word \\"vigil\\" to mean the day before a feast, but recognized the quite different character of the Easter Vigil, which, \\"since it is not a liturgical day, is celebrated in its own way, as a night watch\\".1960 Code of Rubrics, 28 The Roman liturgy now uses the term \\"vigil\\" either in this sense of \\"a night watch\\" or with regard to a Mass celebrated in the evening before a feast, not before the hour of First Vespers.David I. Fulton, Mary DeTurris Poust, The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Catholic Catechism: The Core Teachings of Catholicism in Plain English (Penguin 2008) The psalmody of the office of readings consists of three psalms or portions of psalms, each with its own antiphon. These are followed by two extended readings with their responsories, the first from the Bible (but not from the Gospels), and the second being patristic, hagiographical, or magisterial. As already mentioned, a Gospel reading may optionally be added, preceded by vigil canticles, in order to celebrate a vigil. These are given in an appendix of the book of the Liturgy of the Hours.Liturgia Horarum iuxta ritum Romanum, editio typica altera, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2000 To those who find it seriously difficult, because of their advanced age or for reasons peculiar to them, to observe the revised Liturgy of the Hours Pope Paul VI gave permission to keep using the previous Roman Breviary either in whole or in part. In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI allowed all clergy of the Latin Church to fulfil their canonical obligations by using the 1961 Roman Breviary issued under Pope John XXIII (but not earlier editions such as that of Pius X or Pius V).Summorum Pontificum, art. 9 ¬ß3 Traditionalist Catholic communities, such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter and the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, avail of this authorization.  Non-Roman Western Rites  In the office of the Church of Jerusalem, of which the pilgrim √Ütheria gives us a description, the vigils on Sundays terminated with the solemn reading of the Gospel, in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This practice of reading the Gospel has been preserved in the Benedictine liturgy. In the Tridentine Roman Liturgy this custom, so ancient and so solemn, was no longer represented but by the Homily; but after the Second Vatican Council it has been restored for the celebration of vigils.The General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours, 73 The Ambrosian Liturgy, better perhaps than any other, preserved traces of the great vigils or pannychides, with their complex and varied display of processions, psalmodies, etc. The same liturgy also preserved vigils of long psalmody. This nocturnal office adapted itself at a later period to a more modern form, approaching more and more closely to the Roman liturgy. Here too were found the three nocturns, with Antiphon, psalms, lessons, and responses, the ordinary elements of the Roman matins, and with a few special features quite Ambrosian. As revised after the Second Vatican Council, the Ambrosian liturgy of the hours uses for what once called matins either the designation \\"the part of matins that precedes lLauds in the strict sense\\" or simply \\"office of readings\\".Ambrosian liturgy of the hours in latin: Introduction Its structure is similar to that of the Roman Liturgy of the Hours, with variations such as having on Sundays three canticles, on Saturdays a canticle and two psalms, in place of the three psalms of the other days in the Ambrosian Rite and of every day in the Roman Rite.Ambrosian Liturgy of the Hours in latin: chapter II, IV. De Officio Lectionis In the Mozarabic liturgy, on the contrary, Matins is a system of antiphons, collects, and versicles which make them quite a departure from the Roman system.  Eastern Christianity  = Armenian Rite = In the Armenian liturgy of the hours, Matins is known as the Midnight Office (Armenian: ’´ ’¥’•’ª ’£’´’∑’•÷Ä’´ \\"\\"i mej gisheri\\"\\"). The Armenian Book of Hours, or Zhamagirk\` (Armenian: ‘∫’°’¥’°’£’´÷Ä÷Ñ) states that the Midnight Office is celebrated in commemoration of God the Father. Much of the service consists of the kanon (Armenian: ‘ø’°’∂’∏’∂’°’£’¨’∏÷Ç’≠ \\"\\"kanonagloukh\\"\\"), consisting of a sequence of psalms, hymns, prayers, and in some instances readings from the Gospels, varying according to tone of the day, feast, or liturgical season. The Armenian kanon is quite different in form from the canon of the Byzantine matins service, though both likely share a common ancestor in the pre-dawn worship of the Jerusalem liturgy.  Basic Outline of Matins in the Armenian Church  Introduction (common to all liturgical hours): \\"Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father...Amen.\\" Fixed Preface ‚ÄúLord, if you open my lips, my mouth shall declare your praise.‚Äù (twice) Acclamation: ‚ÄúBlessed is the consubstantial and unitary Holy Trinity...Amen. Psalms: 3, 88, 102, 142 ‚ÄúGlory to the Father...now and always...Amen‚Äù Hymn of the Night Liturgy by Nerses Shnorhali: ‚ÄúLet us remember your name in the night, Lord...‚Äù Proclamation by John Mandakuni ‚ÄúHaving all been awakened in the night from the repose of sleep...‚Äù ‚ÄúLord, have mercy‚Äù (variable number of times: thrice for Sundays and feasts of Christ, 50 times for the feasts of saints, 100 times on days of fasting) Hymn of Nerses Shnorhali: ‚ÄúAll the world... (Ashkharh amenayn)‚Äù ‚ÄúLord, have mercy‚Äù (thrice). ‚ÄúThrough the intercession of the Birthgiver of God: Remember, Lord, and have mercy.‚Äù Hymn of Nerses Shnorhali: ‚ÄúThe rising of the sun... (A·πõawowt lowsoy)‚Äù Prayer: ‚ÄúWe thank you...‚Äù Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia. At this point a section of the Psalter is read, followed by a canticle from the Old or New Testament. See Armenian Liturgy. Following the Psalms and the Canticle is the Canon, a complex sequence of psalms, hymns, and prayers which varies in part according to the liturgical calendar. Conclusion: \\"Our father...Amen.\\" The Armenian Matins or Midnight Office bears some resemblance with the Midnight Office of the Byzantine Rite, such as the recitation of a movable set of hymns depending on the feast. However, the Armenian Midnight Office is generally more elaborate than the Byzantine Midnight Office, in that the Armenian counterpart includes readings from the Gospel, as well as cycles of psalms and prayers reflecting the liturgical season or feast. Other material in the Byzantine office of Matins which has a counterpart in the Armenian daily office, such as the recitation of large sections of the Psalter and the recitation of biblical canticles, occurs in the Armenian liturgy at the Sunrise Hour which follows Matins, corresponding to Lauds. = Byzantine Rite = In the Eastern Churches, matins is called orthros in Greek (, meaning \\"early dawn\\" or \\"daybreak\\") and O√∫trenya in Slavonic (–û—û—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω—è). It is the last of the four night offices, which also include vespers, compline, and midnight office. In traditional monasteries it is celebrated daily so as to end at sunrise. In parishes it is normally served only on Sundays and feast days. Matins is the longest and most complex of the daily cycle of services. The akolouth (fixed portion of the service) is composed primarily of psalms and litanies. The sequences (variable parts) of matins are composed primarily of hymns and canons from the Octoechos (an eight-tone cycle of hymns for each day of the week, covering eight weeks), and from the Menaion (hymns for each calendar day of the year). Matins opens with what is called the \\"Royal Beginning\\", so called because the psalms (19 and 20) are attributed to King David and speak of the Messiah, the \\"king of kings\\"; in former times, the ektenia (litany) also mentioned the emperor by name. The Sunday orthros is the longest of the regular orthros services. If celebrated in its entirety it can last up to three hours.

He was a physician and lawyer. Early life, education, and medical career Born in Richmond, Kentucky, Miller was the son of yeoman farmer Frederick Miller and his wife Patsy. He earned a medical degree in 1838 from Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. While practicing medicine for a decade in Barbourville, Kentucky, he studied the law on his own and was admitted to the bar in 1847. Favoring the abolition of slavery, which was prevalent in Kentucky, he supported the Whigs in Kentucky. Career Miller's house in Keokuk In 1850, Miller moved to Keokuk, Iowa, which was a state more amenable to his views on slavery, and he immediately freed his few slaves who had come with his family from Kentucky. Active in Iowa politics, he supported Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 election. Lincoln nominated Miller to the Supreme Court on July 16, 1862, after the beginning of the American Civil War. His reputation was so high that Miller was confirmed half an hour after the Senate received notice of his nomination. His opinions strongly favored Lincoln's positions, and he upheld his wartime suspension of habeas corpus and trials by military commission. After the war, his narrow reading of the Fourteenth Amendment‚Äîhe wrote the opinion in the Slaughterhouse Cases‚Äîlimited the effectiveness of the amendment. Miller wrote the majority opinion in Bradwell v. Illinois, which held that the right to practice law was not constitutionally protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He later joined the majority opinions in United States v. Cruikshank and the Civil Rights Cases, holding that the amendment did not give the U.S. government the power to stop private‚Äîas opposed to state-sponsored‚Äîdiscrimination against blacks. In Ex Parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 (1884), however, Miller held that the federal government had broad authority to act to protect black voters from violence by the Ku Klux Klan and other private groups. Miller also supported the use of broad federal power under the Commerce Clause to override state regulations, as in Wabash v. Illinois. Justice Miller wrote 616 opinions in his 28 years on the Court; Justice Field (whose 34 year SCOTUS tenure mostly overlapped Miller's) wrote 544 opinions; Chief Justice Marshall wrote 508 opinions in his 33 years on the Court. leading future Chief Justice William Rehnquist to describe him as \\"very likely the dominant figure\\" on the Court in his time.Rehnquist, William, Centennial Crisis: the Disputed Election of 1876, pg. 155 When Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died in 1873, attorneys and law journals across the country lobbied for Miller to be appointed to succeed him, but President Ulysses Grant was determined to appoint an outsider; he ultimately chose Morrison Waite. In his tribute to Miller delivered in Portland, Oregon, on October 16, 1890, George Henry Williams stated his support of Miller in detailing his interactions with President Ulysses S. Grant about Chase's replacement. Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses. Portland, Oregon: F.W. Baltes and Company. pp. 72-76. After the 1876 presidential election between Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden, Miller served on the electoral commission that awarded the disputed electoral votes to the Republican Hayes. In the 1880s, his name was floated as a Republican candidate for president. In the winter of 1889 and spring of 1890, Justice Miller delivered a series of ten lectures on constitutional law at the National University School of Law in Washington D.C. They were published posthumously, along with two earlier lectures delivered in 1887.Miller, Samuel. Lectures on the Constitution of the United States (Bank and Brothers, 1891). Personal Miller's church in Keokuk Miller, a religious liberal, belonged to the Unitarian Church and served as President of the Unitarians' National Conference.

The main entrances to the building are located on Brunswick Street, at the corners of Duke Street and Carmichael Street, at the foot of Citadel Hill. The building's box office entrance is located on Carmichael Street. History The arena was opened on February 17, 1978 as the Halifax Metro Centre, and was built into the ground to compensate for the steep elevation of the land it occupies. Spectators can see cars at street level, outside, while watching an event. In December 2007, an Ozzy Osbourne concert sold out in nine minutes, setting a box office ticket record for the Halifax Metro Centre. In July 2008, the Halifax Metro Centre also set a record sell-out (25,000 tickets sold in 40 minutes), for two back-to-back Elton John concerts held in late September 2008. In April 2012, the Halifax Mooseheads sold out game 6 of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League semifinals in 20 minutes. On May 9, 2013, QMJHL Presidents Cup final Game 5 sold-out in record time 11 minutes, setting another attendance mark for the Scotiabank Centre. The facility is owned by the municipality but operated by Trade Centre Limited. On June 25, 2014, it was announced that Scotiabank had won the naming rights to the facility and that the Metro Centre would be renamed the Scotiabank Centre. Scotiabank wins naming rights for Halifax Metro Centre The Chronicle Herald The facility officially opened its doors as the rebranded Scotiabank Centre on September 19, 2014. Arena information Halifax Metro Centre (now Scotiabank Centre) in 2006. The Scotiabank Centre originally featured a full ring of bright orange seats around the playing surface, which is known as the \\"lower bowl\\". It also has an incomplete \\"upper bowl\\" on each side of the arena facing rink-side (court-side) with seats of the same colour. In the mid to late 1990s, there were numerous renovations to the arena, including the addition of 43 SkyBoxes and 11 \\"Executive Suites\\". The addition of the SkyBoxes has since partially obscured views for people sitting high up in the upper bowl. Views of some or all of the ice surface from the uppermost rows of seating is either partially or fully blocked by the boxes. To help mitigate this issue, video projection equipment was installed that projects onto the exterior rear walls of the boxes: If a video recording is being produced for an event, then a live feed of the video may be projected for the benefit of people in the obstructed parts of the upper bowl. Before the 2002‚Äì03 ice hockey season, in preparation for the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship, a new scoreboard and \\"SilverVision\\" LED screens were added. The arena concourses feature photographs of the various events that have taken place at the Scotiabank Centre, with one side featuring entertainment events and the other featuring sporting events. It currently has a seating capacity of 10,595 for ice hockey. The building is connected to the Downtown Halifax Link system. When the rebranded Scotiabank Centre was unveiled in September 2014, plans to use funding received from the naming rights partnership for capital reinvestment in the facility were also announced. Started from January 2015 to September 2015 the Scotiabank Centre renovated the concessions adding Taste 902, Asian, Links, Donairs, etc. The bathrooms were also renovated, and the original orange seats were replaced with new navy blue ones. The original roof was replaced with a thermoplastic membrane through 2016 to 2017. In the summer of 2018, the original ice-level concrete floor and cooling system was replaced.

It is part of Lambton County and is surrounded by Enniskillen Township. It is billed as \\"Canada's Victorian Oil Town\\" and is often credited with starting the oil industry in North America. Lambton Central Collegiate & Vocational Institute (LCCVI) is the only high school located in Petrolia. History Victoria Hall, housing Petrolia's municipal offices and a theatre, was built in 1889 In 1857 James Miller Williams of Hamilton began distilling some of the \\"tar\\" lying around Oil Springs (located a few kilometers south from Petrolia), after buying the property rights from Charles Nelson Tripp. In July or August 1858 he struck an oil deposit in Oil Springs while digging a shallow well, sparking the oil drilling industry. In 2008, the 150th anniversary of the discovery, Canada Post issued a stamp commemorating this first commercial oil well, featuring portraits of Charles Tripp and Williams. However, these early wells resulted in a large amount of wastage from gushers, estimated at of oil in 1862 alone. Petrolia got its start in 1866 when a major gas well was found, resulting in an oil boom that caused many to abandon Oil Springs in favour of this new settlement. The place separated from Enniskillen Township and was incorporated as a town on 25 December of that same year. Oil production went through several boom periods in Petrolia; one was in 1898 and another in 1938. Some wells sunk in 1938 were initially producing at a price of $2 per barrel. This output, however, often lasted only a few weeks, falling to less than a barrel a day. Oil men from Petrolia travelled to the far reaches of the world (Gobi Desert, Arctic, Iran, Indonesia, United States, Australia, Russia, and over 80 other countries) teaching others how to find and extract crude oil. Those born and raised in Petrolia are referred to as \\"Hard Oilers\\", paying tribute to the toughness of their ancestors. Petrolia is also home to the Petrolia Discovery museum (currently closed for renovations). Some oil fields in the area are still operational to this day. Media and entertainment Petrolia is home to Victoria Hall, a National Historic Site of Canada. Originally a fire hall, municipal office, police hall, jail and opera house, it was completed in 1889 for a total cost of $35 000. In January 1989, a fire caused extensive damage. It was subsequently restored, and re-opened in 1992. Currently it houses the town hall and Victoria Playhouse. Until September 2013, The Petrolia Topic was the sole newspaper in the town of Petrolia. It is owned by Osprey Media. In September 2013, The Independent of Petrolia & Central Lambton began publication. The Oil Heritage District Community Centre was opened in Petrolia in 2006, after twenty years of campaigning by the group \\"The Oil Heritage District Community Centre Association\\" which was started in 1985. It serves rural and town residents in central Lambton County.

The area has many local beauty spots, while the nearby village of Ballyliffin is famous for its golf course. The Urris valley to the west of Clonmany village was the last outpost of the Irish language in Inishowen. In the 19th century, the area was an important location for poit√≠n distillation.Straid Church, Clonmany (Photo by Martin McLaughlin) Roxtown Beach, Clonmany (Photo by Mark McGaughey) Name The name of the town in Irish - Cluain Maine has been translated as both \\"The Meadow of St. Maine\\" and \\"The Meadow of the Monks\\", with the former being the more widely recognized translation. The village is known locally as \\"The Cross\\", as the village was initially built around a crossroads. History The parish was home to a monastery that was founded by St. Columba. It was closely associated with the Morrison family, who provided the role of erenagh. The monastery possessed the M√≠osach, a copper and silver shrine, now located in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. Details of local history and traditions were recorded in \\"The Last of the Name\\", recorded by schoolteacher Patrick Kavanagh (NOT the poet) from stories by Clonmany local, Charles McGlinchey. The village claims to be the youngest in Inishowen. The 18th Century travel writer - Richard Pococke - did not mention the village when he toured the area in 1752. The village is mentioned in Topographia Hibernica, published in 1795. It did not feature in the census of 1841 or 1851. In the 1861 census, 112 inhabitants are recorded as living in Clonmany in 21 houses. A further 3 houses are recorded as uninhabited. =The Poitin Republic of Urris= In the early 19th century, Urris - a valley three miles west of Clonmany - became a center of the illegal poit√≠n distillation industry. The Urris Hills were an ideal place for poit√≠n- making. The area was surrounded by mountains and only accessible through Mamore Gap and Crossconnell. Notwithstanding its remote location, Londonderry was about 16 miles away, providing a major market for the trade. To protect their lucrative business, the locals barricaded the road at Crossconnell to keep out revenue police, thus creating the \\"Poitin Republic of Urris\\". This period of relative independence lasted three years. But in 1815, the authorities re-established control of the Urris Hills and brought this short period of self-rule to an end. =The 1840 earthquake= In 1840, the village experienced an earthquake, a comparatively rare event in Ireland. The shock was also felt in the nearby town of Carndonagh. The Belfast Newsletter from Tuesday, January 28, 1840 reported that \\"In some places those who had retired to rest felt themselves shaken in their beds, and others were thrown from their chairs, and greatly alarmed.\\"Belfast Newsletter 1738-1938, Tuesday, January 28, 1840; Page: 4 = The \\"Waterloo Priest\\" = From 1829 to 1853, the Parish of Clonmany was served by Fr. William O‚ÄôDonnell ‚Äì the ‚ÄúWaterloo Priest‚Äù. He was born in Cockhill, Buncrana in 1779. In 1802 he entered Maynooth College, but upon graduation he declined the opportunity to become a priest. Instead he joined the army and campaigned in the Peninsular war, where he fought in the battles of Vittoria, Roncesvalles and Pyrenees. Later, he fought at the Battle of Waterloo. In 1819, he was ordained and served as parish priest in Lower Fahan and Desertegney. In 1829, he was appointed parish priest in Clonmany, a post he held until his death in 1856. His time at Clonmany was marked by a deep devotion to the people of the parish. He established five National schools in the Parish. He campaigned strongly for the rights of the local people. In 1838, during the latter years of the tithe war, he was jailed for non-payment of tithes to the Church of Ireland. He was jailed in Lifford Prison and he became a national focal point in the campaign against the tithe system. In 1846, at the beginning of the famine, he set up a Relief Committee for Clonmany. He died February 10, 1856 in his residence in Clonmany aged 77. = The Famine = Like much of Ireland, the surrounding areas of Clonmany were devastated by the potato blight leading to an appalling loss of life among the rural poor. As early as December 1845, there were warning signs that the potato crop around Clonmany was failing and disaster was imminent. The Church of Ireland Rector of Clonmany - Rev. George H. Young - had reported to the Banner of Ulster Newspaper that \\"one-half of all (the potatoes) dug was, more or less, diseased. I am sure l am correct in stating, that not less than three-fourths of the crop has been already lost. How or from whence seed is to be provided, I know not\\". Local clergy - both Roman Catholic and Protestant - made valiant efforts to raise funds and provide relief but the magnitude of the crop failure and the spread of diseases like Dysentery meant that these efforts were overwhelmed. By January 1847, a local relief committee was activity raising funds to provide emergency food supplies. The committee contacted local landlords seeking financial support and debt forgiveness for tenants in rent arrears. The response from landlords was varied; some were willing to provide help; others were not. Local landlord - Michael Loughrey of Binion hall - contributed to the fund. John Harvey and Mrs Merrick wrote to Fr. O'Donnell - parish priest and chairman of the committee - indicating that they would not support the relief efforts until rent arrears and other costs were paid first. This correspondence was published in the Derry Journal. Around the same time, the Derry Sentinel reported that Clonmany was experiencing a death rate of five to six individuals each day. = Land Wars in the 19th Century = Throughout the 19th century, the rural areas surrounding Clonmany experienced significant conflict over the issues of land ownership and tenant rights. During the 1830s, the Ribbon men and night-walkers were active in the area. This was a popular Catholic movement that protested against landlords and their agents. In February 1832, crowds of up to three thousand local tenants attacked the properties of two prominent landlords; Michael Doherty of Glen House and Neal Loughrey of Binnion. The protesters demanded a reduction in rents and the elimination of tithe payments to the Church of Ireland. Unrest also broke out in Spring 1833. A local man by the name of O'Donnell had his house destroyed by rioters after he took over the property from an evicted tenant. Rioters also destroyed the forge of the local blacksmith (by the name of Conaghan) after he had provided services to the tithe agent. Rioters also smashed the property of local people who were employed directly by landlords. In February 1834, the army posted to the village a detachment of the 1st Royals Regiment from the Londonderry Garrison to provide support to the civil authorities. Further unrest occurred out in April 1834 when large crowds rioted and destroyed property. Violence again broke out in June 1838, when a crowd of local people attacked the house where an absentee landlord - Mrs Merrick - was temporarily staying. At the time, she was visiting the area to view her properties. The home of Mrs Merrick's bailliff - Hugh Bradley - was attacked on September 1838. Bradley was badly beaten and his house was ransacked by a group of armed men. Mrs Merrick later offered a reward of ¬£100 for any information regarding the attacks on Bradley. In 1852, local tenants attacked Charles McClintock. He was a civil engineer who was surveying local properties on behalf of Michael Doherty, one of the main landlords in the area. Attackers fired shots into McClintock's bedroom and pelted the house with rocks. On occasions, the violence took on a sectarian nature. In January 1861, the Protestant chapel in Clonmany was attacked. The windows were smashed and the door was destroyed. During the 1880s, evictions and protests against landlordism were relatively common events. In January 1881, four local men were arrested for unlawful assembly and riotous behavior after they attacked a bailiff employed by a landlord called Harvey. The Land League established a Clonmany branch, which was named after the founder of the organization - Michael Davitt. Its activities were often reported by the Derry Journal. The newspaper recorded a steady flow of protests and evictions throughout the 1880s. The local Catholic clergy were active in defending the rights of tenants and in concert with the Land League they regularly pleaded the cases of individual tenants to local Landlords. In December 1885, the clergy and land league sent a deputation to Mr. Loughrey, a landlord who had a difficult relationship with his tenants. When the Land League representatives remarked on the low value of land, Mr. Loughrey replied \\"the tenants were too cheaply rented, that they wanted to drive me and my family to the workhouse, but I will take steps to draw a good many there along with me\\". The Loughrey estate was one of the largest in the area. Evictions were often met with organized protest. To mitigate these protests, landlords combined to organize joint mass evictions supported by a sizable police and military presence. This often meant that tenants had accumulated rent arrears for several years before the evictions took place. For example, on a single day in June 1881, 80 armed police entered Clonmany to oversee a series of evictions in the surrounding area. These evictions were collectively organized by four local landlords. A protest march was organized by the Land League and the local Priest - Fr. Maguire - who figured prominently in the opposition to evictions. The evictions proved to be a tortuous process, with bailiffs poorly informed about the precise location of properties, miss-identification of tenants and disputes about whether the rents had actually been paid or not. In March 1882, the Derry Journal reported that a further 18 evictions had taken place on the Loughrey estate which made over 100 individuals homeless. The eviction of Catherine Doherty in August 1882 was typical. She was a widow who lived in Cleagh, a townland just outside Clonmany. She had accumulated significant arrears before her landlord took legal proceedings against her. The Derry Journal recorded the event. > \\"The first house visited was that of widow Catherine Doherty. She owed two > years‚Äô rent. A writ was served on her May, 1881, Just two days after the > rent became due. She tried to have a settlement effected but all in vain. > She offered two years‚Äô rent (¬£8 11s) with the half the costs, but that offer > was flatly refused by the agent, who would accept nothing less than the > entire amount of rent and costs, to be paid before he would leave the house. > The Rev.

The ranks of the soldiers and > police were ordered (to) march to Rooskey, where the next eviction was (to) > come off. Denis O‚ÄôDonnell, three in family, was the tenant. His time of > redemption having expired\\" Concerns about extent of evictions around the Clonmany was raised in parliament by the Irish Nationalist MP O'Donnell. In March 1882, He asked the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland if he knew about: \\"the extensive evictions of tenants, for arrears of rent, are taking place, or are about to take place, in the districts of Clonmany, Binnion, Garryduff, Adderville, and Cardonagh, in the county of Donegal; whether it is true that meetings of the inhabitants to protest against these evictions, and to invite public sympathy with poor tenants, on the ground of their incapability to pay the unreduced rents accumulating since the years of distress, have been prohibited by the Government\\". In May 1883, Thomas Sexton (the Irish Nationalist MP for Sligo) asked a question in parliament regarding the conduct of the Royal Irish Constabulary towards evicted tenants in Clonmany. Mr. Sexton reported that a tenant farmer named Doherty was prevented by the police from erecting huts to shelter evicted families. He reported that 23 families comprising 108 people had taken refuge in Clonmany with as many as four families sleeping into one small house. Sir George Trevelyan the Chief Secretary for Ireland, disputed this account. He said that Doherty wanted to build his hut near some evicted farms, and this would require the Police to build an outpost to guard these properties. This construction would impose costs on the local community. In September 1885, local landlords sent in four \\"Emergency Men\\" to take possession of farms where tenants were previously evicted. After the tenants were removed from their homes, they continued to use the land to grow crops. The \\"Emergency men\\" arrived to take possession of these crops. In order to protect these new arrivals, the police were required to station half a dozen men in the district. Protests often targeted local individuals who had assisted in evictions. In July 1888, seven local men were accused of interfering with the burial of Patrick Cavanagh. He was a former veteran of the Crimean War who worked on the Loughery estate. Cavanagh had become unpopular with the local residents after he became the caretaker of the properties of recently evicted tenants. The seven accused men were John O'Donnell, William Harkin, William Gubbin, Patrick Gubbln, Owen Doherty, from Clonmany; Constantine Doherty, from Cleagh; and Michael Doherty, from Cloontagh. The men were accused of filling up the newly dug grave with large stones and preventing the body from entering the graveyard. No one in the village was prepared to supply a coffin for Cavanagh. The local Catholic Clergy begged the demonstrators to allow the burial to proceed. The demonstrators threatened that if the body were buried in the graveyard that they would dig it up. Eventually, the Local Government Board issued an administrative order to remove the body for interment in the Carndonagh Workhouse cemetery. The case aroused much interest and was reported widely across the United Kingdom. Two of the accused - Owen Doherty and Constantine Doherty - were found guilty of unlawful assembly and sentenced to six months imprisonment. The remaining men were discharged. = First World War = The area around Clonmany has strong military associations. In 1914, the British Army opened a training camp named Glenfield Camp, which was located near Glen House, Straid. Up to 5,000 soldiers were garrisoned at Glenfield, including battalions from the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Devonshire Regiment and the Royal Irish Fusiliers. There were also military establishments in Leenan and Dunree. The latter fort was first established during the Napoleonic wars. Both Leenan and Dunree were used to guard the entrance of Loch Swilley, which was used to station part of the Royal Navy's Atlantic Fleet. These latter two camps formed part of the Treaty Ports, which the UK Armed Forces continued to use after the Irish Free State was established. These camps were transferred to the Irish Armed Forces in October 1938. =Irish War of Independence= In early 1920 an IRA company was established in Clonmany. It formed part of the 2nd Battalion of the Donegal IRA which was based on Carndonagh. The battalion also included companies from Culdaff, Malin, Malin Head and Carndonagh.ROINN COSANTA. BUREAU OF MILITARY HISTORY, 1913-21. STATEMENT BY WITNESS. DOCUMENT NO. W.S. 1516. In August 1920, the IRA conducted extensive raids on houses throughout the district to collect firearms held by local residents. In November 1920, British armed forces reciprocated, twice raiding the village and the surrounding area, searching almost every home, and in some cases, ripping up floorboards. The search uncovered considerable quantities of ammunition. In April 1921, Joseph Doherty, a farmer from Lenan, was found guilty for possessing firearms \\"not under effective military control.\\" During a search at the home of Doherty's mother, a single-barreled breech-loading shotgun was found concealed in a corn stack. Doherty made a statement indicating that he knew nothing about the gun, which \\"must have been planted in the corn stack by someone who wished to get him into trouble.\\" During the trial, Doherty refused to recognize the court. The judge remarked that the accused's refusal to recognize the court had only one interpretation, that he belonged to an illegal society. The most notorious incident to occur in Clonmany during the conflict happened on 10 May 1921, when two Royal Irish Constabulary constables - Alexander Clarke and Charles Murdock - were kidnapped and murdered by the IRA. Both men were stationed at the RIC Barracks in Clonmany. They went for a walk in the evening but were kidnapped near Straid. Clarke was shot and thrown into the sea, and his body washed up on the seashore near Binion the next day. Constable Murdock, who was from Dublin, reportedly survived the initial attack, escaped and sought refuge among residents of Binion. However, he was betrayed to the IRA who murdered him. His body has never been found. Local tradition suggests that he was buried in a bog near Binion hill. In June 1921, a military court was held in Clonmany to conduct a postmortem for PC Clarke. The court found that Clarke had died from a gunshot wounds to the heart, jaw and neck and that his firearm and ammunition was missing. At the time of his death, Clarke was 23 years old and unmarried. A few days after the murders of Constables Murdock and Clark, six bridges on the road between Buncrana and Clonmany were destroyed with explosives. These attacks effectively isolated much of North Inishowen. It also significantly delayed the repatriation of the body of Constable Clarke. The Police were forced to commandeer local labour to make temporary repairs to bridges in order to transport part the body to England. A few weeks later, on July 10, 1921 Crown Forces raided a number of houses in Clonmany looking for Sinn F√©in activists. Three unnamed young men from the village were arrested, but were released shortly afterwards and allowed to return home. In July 1921, railway workers at Clonmany railway station refused to transport British Soldiers. The soldiers were removed from the train and sent back to Leenan fort. = Irish Civil War = The conflict was fought between two opposing groups of Irish nationalists: those who supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty under which the Irish Free state was established, and the republican opposition, for whom the Treaty represented a betrayal of the Irish Republic. Clonmany was captured by Free State Forces on July 1, 1922. A train was commandeered from Buncrana. It moved troops to Clonmany and later onto Carndonagh. The capture of Clonmany was peaceful. When the troops arrived in Carndonagh, a gun battle broke out with Anti-Treaty Irregulars, who had taken up positions in the Workhouse. The Irregulars agreed to surrender after the Free State Army had opened fire with a machine gun. = Second World War = thumb During the mid-20th century, a cottage based textiles industry had developed around Clonmany. During the war, many local women were contracted to make shirts for the British Army. These contracts were allocated to cottage producers by firms in Buncrana and Derry that were unable to manage the large orders from the British War Office. In August 1940, a body washed up on the shore at Gaddyduff, Clonmany. The body was recovered by Mr. Denis Kealey, a farmer's son, of Leenan. A postcard was found on the body indicating that the victim was Giovanni Ferdenzi ; an Italian migrant to the UK, who lived in Kings Cross. He was previously held at Worth-Mills Internment Camp. The cause of death was heart failure due to exposure. The body was given Catholic burial at Clonmany. Giovanni was being transported to Canada on SS Arandora Star, which was sunk by a U-Boat on 2 July 1940. A second unidentifiable body was washed ashore on Ballyliffin strand. In March 1946, eight mines were destroyed by the Irish Army after they had floated close to the shoreline between Ballyliffin and Clonmany. The mines appeared after a heavy storm.  Floods, Storms and Dangerous Sea Currents  The village has periodically suffered from storms coming off the Atlantic Ocean. These storms have caused flooding, typically after heavy rainfall during the summer months, On May 28, 1892, Clonmany experienced three hours of torrential rain, that caused the banks of the Clonmany river to break. Several hundred acres of land was flooded, with a large loss of crops and livestock. The townlands of Crossconnell. Tanderagee, Cleagh, Cloontagh, and Gortfad were all heavily flooded. Two years later, in December 1894, the area was hit by another violent storm. The church roofs in Clonmany and Urris were damaged. Many thatched cottages had their roofs blown away entirely. A large amount of agricultural production was destroyed. After a period of heavy rain during September 1952, the banks of the Clonmany river broke, flooding a number of corn fields. The area around Crossconnell was particularly affected. In August 1952, the banks of the Clonmany river again broke after a period of very heavy rain. The rains coincided with a high tide, which further exacerbated the flood. Water reached the houses within the village itself. In late August 2017, the village was severely affected by flooding brought on by an extended period of heavy rains. In a seven-hour period, over 80 millimeters of rain was recorded. Some residents were cut off due to rising river levels and had to be rescued from their homes. The R238 road, which links the village with Dumfree, was closed after a bridge collapsed.The Irish defense forces were deployed to help with rescue and clean up efforts. In 2014, the National Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment Report highlighted Clonmany and its surrounding areas as one of 28 areas that may need flood protection as sea levels are expected to rise due to climate change. = Local Beaches = There are several scenic beaches around Clonmany, which are popular with tourists. However, these beaches have treacherous sea currents which can pose a risk to swimmers. A 15-year-old boy was drowned while bathing in Clonmany Strand in August 1945. In September 1959, two young men, aged 26 and 15 were drowned on Tullagh beach after getting into trouble while swimming.  Places of Interest  St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church - A very good example of a pre-emancipation Catholic Church. The building was started around 1814, with an extension to north to form T- plan built in 1833. A three-stage tower on square-plan was built in 1843. Clonmany Church of Ireland Parish Church - Located in Straid, just outside the village. Built in 1772 and altered in 1830. The building is now a ruin, but is accessible to visitors. The graveyard also contains a number of graves of early eighteenth-century date and maybe earlier, that predates the present edifice and may be associated with an earlier church on the site. Clonmany Bridge - A triple-arch slightly humpbacked bridge carrying the road to Urris over the Clonmany river, built around 1800. It was in existence in 1814, when it was mentioned in the 'Statistical Account of the Parish of Clonmany'. Climate The location of Clonmany on the Inishowen peninsula, and bordering Lough Swilly with views of the Atlantic provides the Clonmany area with a moderate climate; with temperate, mild summers, and winters that rarely go below freezing. The average temperatures for the area are usually warmer than the national average in winter, and cooler than the national average in summer. Clonmany Roman Catholic church. Education The Square, Clonmany.Clonmany has four primary schools, Clonmany N.S. (with a new state of the art school), Scoil Naomh Treasa (also known as Tiernasligo N.S. locally), Scoil Ph√°draig at Rashenny, and Scoil na gCluainte, or Cloontagh National School. Most students from these schools go on to attend secondary level education at Carndonagh Community School in Carndonagh, with most of the remainder attending Scoil Mhuire or Crana College in Buncrana. There was a national school in Crossconnell, which dated from the 19th century. However, it was closed in the late 1960s. Transport Clonmany railway station opened on 1 July 1901, but finally closed on 2 December 1935. The station was a stop on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company (The L&LSR;, the Swilly) that operated in parts of County Londonderry and County Donegal. Culture & tourism Clonmany is host to the annual McGlinchey summer school, which attracts many visitors to its exhibitions and lectures on local history. Another attraction is the Clonmany festival, held annually during the week of the Irish August public holiday. The Clonmany Agricultural Show and Sheepdog Trials takes place on the Tuesday of festival week, with visitors from all over Inishowen and the Northwest of Ireland. Sports The Clonmany Tug of War team has enjoyed remarkable success over many years. The team was formed in 1946, and has achieved six world gold medals and twenty All Ireland titles. The village has a soccer team - Clonmany Shamrocks. Urris Is the local GAA team and the home ground is situated in Straid, Clonmany. The team colours are red and black.

Sliding is widely considered to be an essential component of baserunning in both youth and professional baseball, though not precisely for the same reason. A baserunner may slide into a base in a number of different ways and for a number of perceived reasons, including to avoid a tag out, to avoid overrunning the base, and to interfere or avoid contact with the defensive player protecting the base. Players determine whether they will benefit by sliding in a particular game situation, and whether an increased risk of injury will make a slide worthwhile. Methods of sliding There are many different ways to slide, involving different ways of attempting to avoid the tag, reaching to touch the base, or trying to contact or avoid collision with the defensive player. Since the defense generally expects a slide, sometimes a baserunner trying to avoid being tagged out will not slide directly towards the base, but rather to a side away from where the ball is coming, and then reach back to touch the base. Players generally slide feet- first but sometimes also use a head-first technique. Strictly speaking, going headfirst into a base constitutes more of a dive than a slide, but the term \\"slide\\" is still commonly used. This alternate method has been used in Major League Baseball at least since the middle-1880s when the innovation was popularized by the St. Louis Browns of the American Association.\\"A Big Stake: What the Chicago and St. Louis Clubs Are Playing For,\\" St. Louis Post- Dispatch, Oct. 23, 1886, pg. 8. Yet even in the majors, it remained relatively uncommon until it became popularized by Pete Rose in the 1960s. Headfirst sliding has since become a common practice for various players on all levels of professional baseball, but it is often restricted on the amateur level. Reasons for sliding =Avoiding a tag out= A shortstop attempts to tag out a player sliding head-first into a base On plays in which the baserunner may be tagged out by the opposing defensive player covering the base, the baserunner's body being down on the ground presents the lowest-profile target for the defensive player to tag. This makes it slightly more difficult for the defensive player to apply the tag in time to put out the baserunner. =Avoiding overrunning the base= Sliding helps a runner stop his forward momentum through the friction created between the body and the ground, thus reducing the likelihood that he will run past the base after touching it. This is important because in most cases a runner is in jeopardy of being tagged out if he loses contact with the base (the most common exception is that a batter- runner may overrun first base when initially reaching that base as long as he immediately returns to first base without attempting to advance to second base). Because the runner must balance the need to reach a base as quickly as possible with the need to avoid overrunning the base, sliding provides a rapid means for the runner to decelerate, allowing the baserunner to run at top speed as long as possible before needing to slow down. =Interfering with the defensive player (take-out slide)= A catcher attempts to block a player from reaching home plate Sliding can sometimes be used as a means of interfering with the play of the opposing defensive player who is covering the base being approached. For example, when it is possible that a double play might occur, and the baserunner approaching second base has already been put out, he might still try to slide toward the defensive player who intends to throw the ball to first base. If the defensive player moves away from second base as he prepares to throw the ball toward first, the baserunner may still slide directly toward the defensive player, even though that means sliding away from second base itself. This has the effect of hampering that defensive player's ability to complete the play, either directly by making physical contact with him, or indirectly by distracting him by making him fearful of such contact. A slide performed exclusively for the purpose of hampering the play of the defense is called a \\"take-out slide\\". Whether a particular instance of a take- out slide is legal within the rules of baseball is a judgement call made by the umpire, usually based upon how close the baserunner comes to the base they are approaching during the slide. If a baserunner strays too far from the base when attempting a take-out slide, the umpire may declare the slide to be an example of illegal interference and call an extra out. As a general (but not absolute) guideline, even if the baserunner clearly slides toward the defensive player and away from the base, so long as the baserunner comes close enough to the base that he is able to touch it with some part of his body during the slide, the slide will be ruled to be legal. On the flip side, the fielder will often be granted the neighborhood play under such circumstances. =Avoiding collision or injury from errant throw= Particularly for younger players, proper sliding technique has been shown to protect the runner and fielder from colliding and can prevent the runner from being hit by an errant throw. For this reason, most youth baseball leagues now advise teaching proper sliding technique at a young age and urge kids to slide feet-first into any base (except first base) whenever there is a potentially close play. This concept is somewhat more controversial in adult amateur baseball/softball leagues since the risk of injury from sliding increases with age. Speed impact of sliding Legendary early 20th century American player Ty Cobb sliding safely into third base. The television series MythBusters tested participants' baserunning speed with and without sliding, and found that in cases where the runner needs to stop on the base, sliding into that base instead of staying upright provided a split second of advantage, suggesting the more rapid deceleration as the key. However, when removing the need to stop, the general belief within baseball circles is that remaining upright and running all the way to the base at top speed allows a baserunner to reach the base faster than sliding. Consequently, on plays during which neither being tagged out nor being put in jeopardy by overrunning the base is at issue (e.g., when approaching first base after having batted the ball and nobody is trying to make a tag play), players are usually advised not to slide.Jackson, Tony. (2011, February 22). \\"Davey Lopes, Dodgers go back to basics\\", ESPNLosAngeles.com Nonetheless, this conventional wisdom is not universally accepted, and as such, some players may feel that sliding will get them to the base more quickly and will thus choose to do so despite advice to the contrary. Risks associated with sliding One study in the American Journal of Sports Medicine followed seven softball and three baseball teams in Division I of the NCAA, and found the overall incidence of injuries sustained while sliding was 9.51 per 1000 slides. Softball players had about twice the incidence of sliding injuries as baseball players in the study. 11% (four out of 37) of the injuries caused the player to miss more than 7 days of participation. Because baseball shoes are spiked on the bottom, sliding with the spikes up increases the probability of injury to the defensive player covering the base. Knowledge of this fact can often increase the defensive player's fear of the possible contact from an impending slide and thus increase his distraction while attempting to make a play. Ty Cobb developed nine different ways to slide into a base.Geng, Don. Fundamental Baseball. Minneapolis: Lerner Publications, 1995. 13 References Category:Baseball terminology ","title":"Slide (baseball)"},{"id":"890530","text":"summer cottage in Finnish Lakeland, Finland A private island is a disconnected body of land wholly owned by a private citizen or corporation. Although this exclusivity gives the owner substantial control over the property, private islands remain under the jurisdiction of national and sometimes local governments. Ownership Virtually all islands in the world are claimed and governed by some national government. That nation's laws apply, and any attempt by the owner to claim sovereignty would generally be unrealistic. Nevertheless, some people still try to set up their own micronations on islands, like real-estate millionaire Michael Oliver's attempt at building a libertarian city-state called the Republic of Minerva in the southern Pacific Ocean. There are widely varying government policies regarding private islands: for instance, islands off the coast of China, like any other land within the country,https://www.loc.gov/law/help/real-property- law/china.php cannot be purchased outright, but only leased from the government for a maximum period of 50 years. \\"Private\\" islands in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile and other countries are not legally entirely privateany foreshore, such as a beach, is owned by the government, and is hence publicly accessible property, despite what the owners of the land on the island may wish to claim. The same applies to freedom to roam in Nordic countries: only the yard of a house and the immediate vicinity is legally protected against trespassing, and the water bodies around the island are freely navigable. There are many thousands of uninhabited islands in the world with potential for commercial development of tourist resorts or private recreational use. Some islands can be bought undeveloped, while others already have roads and/or houses. Islands are also available for rent. Many celebrities have their own private islands. Commercial development of uninhabited islands can raise ecological concerns, as many have a fragile environment. =Cruise lines= Since 1992 a number of cruise lines have acquired ‚Äúprivate islands‚Äù to offer their customers exclusive beach experiences. Such islands (or sections thereof) were further developed to have restaurants and perhaps additional attractions such as parasailing, waterparks, zip lines, horseback riding, spas and more. Some islands have piers, others are reached by tender. The purchase of an island allows the cruise line to achieve greater control over the venue and to influence the quality of experience of their passengers. Certain private islands may be used not only by the cruise line that bought the property but also by associated lines. =List of \\"private islands\\" of cruise lines= * Castaway Cay, owner Disney Cruise Line, pier access * Labadee, Haiti, a peninsula, owner Royal Caribbean Cruises, pier access * Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas, owner Norwegian Cruise Line * Little Stirrup Cay (Coco Cay), Bahamas, owner Royal Caribbean Cruises, pier access * Harvest Caye, Belize, owner Norwegian Cruise Line * Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, owner Holland America Line * Princess Cays, part of Eleuthera, Bahamas, owner Princess Cruises, bought in 1992 * Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve, Bahamas, MSC Cruises * Sir Bani Yas Island 'Beach Oasis' at Sir Bani Yas, Abu Dhabi, MSC Cruises Real estate The World archipelago off the coast of Dubai are privately held Weddell Island in the Falkland Islands, South Atlantic is privately owned The real estate market for private islands varies globally. Prices tend to be lower in Nova Scotia, parts of Michigan and Maine, and parts of Central America; and higher in Europe, the Bahamas, and Oceanic countries like French Polynesia. Islands with amenities have higher market value and are not sold as frequently. Some are available for travelers to rent, a trend which increased in the 2000s with economic recession making it more difficult for some owners to maintain them. In the 2000s, the United States housing bubble increased the cost-per-acre for private islands. The effect was fueled by the advent of the Internet, which provided greater access to island inventories. Conservation groups' efforts to restrict development reduced the supply of private islands in the market, raising prices. Southeast Asia has numerous islands, with Indonesia being an archipelago of 17,000 islands and the Philippines having around 7,100. Real estate laws restrict foreigners' ability to buy property in the geographical area, and many islands either have unclear ownership rights or are already settled. Private islands that are available in Southeast Asia's real estate market are also prohibitively costly due to being in high demand by hotel developers. Developments address these difficulties by selling private islands that have villas and neighbor islands that have high-end hotels; the proximity keeps costs of habitation down. Europe has hundreds of thousands of islands many of which are privately owned. With 17,000 islands in Finland, 221,831 islands in Sweden and thousands in Croatia, Europe is increasingly becoming a hotspot for private island holidays. Many islands, although privately owned, are not suitable for development due to legal and governmental restrictions or due to the physical characteristics of the island. The Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic feature a number of private islands typically run as sheep raising family farms and tourist destinations. Prominent among these is Weddell Island, one of the largest private islands in the world with a surface area of .H. Pichon, N. Rolland and N. Orlova. D2.1.1 Inventory Report.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Stovey played for 14 seasons in the majors and was appointed player-manager on two separate occasions during his career. Known today as both a prolific home run hitter and base-stealer, he led the league in both categories multiple times in his career, including a season record of 14 home runs in and a league-leading 97 stolen bases in . From 1880 to 1891 he appeared in the top 10 in home runs every year except 1887, and led the league five times. He was the first to wear sliding pads and among the first to slide feet first. Baseball career =Philadelphia Defiance= In 1877, Harry began his career in the pitcher‚Äôs box and graduated out of the ranks of a Philadelphia amateur team called the Defiance (the Philadelphia Defiance were a professional team, part of the league Alliance). =New Bedford= In 1878, Frank Bancroft, owner/manager of the New Bedford Baseball Club, engaged Stovey to join his pitching staff. When the New Bedfords' John Piggot, first baseman, became ill during their first exhibition game of the season, Stovey was asked to take over, and played brilliantly enough that he replaced Piggott as the starting first basemen for the entire season. =Worcester= Harry was an outfielder / first baseman in for the Worcester Worcesters under the surname of Stovey instead of his birth name of Stowe due to his desire to keep his family from discovering he was making his career at baseball, which was seen at the time as not a respectable profession. He made an immediate impact that first season, leading the league with 14 triples and six home runs, while also finishing in the top ten in many other offensive categories. On July 17, he hit his first major league home run off Jim McCormick of the Cleveland Blues. For the season, his offensive numbers did not slow down, again finishing in the top ten in several offensive categories, though he did not lead the league in any this time around. On August 17, 1881, Worcester suspended Captain Mike Dorgan‚Äö and Stovey took over the position for the remainder of the season. Lee Richmond‚Äö who had quit because of conflicts with Dorgan‚Äö rejoined the team after this switch. In , his last season for the Worcesters, his batting average saw an increase, up to .289 from .270 the year before, but his numbers in relation to the rest of the league took a slight dip. He ranked third in the league in runs scored, with 90, and fourth in the league in home runs, with five. =Philadelphia= Baseball card of Stovey For the season, Stovey moved on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, and it was during the next seven years when he had his best years, and made his greatest impact on the game. His first season in Philadelphia saw him set the single season record for home runs with 14, breaking the old mark of nine set by Charley Jones in . He kept this record for only one season, as Ned Williamson set a new mark the very next season with 27. Not only did he set the home run record, he batted .306, and led the league in runs scored with 110, doubles with 31, and games played with 112, while also finishing in the top five in most offensive categories. The offensive explosiveness continued throughout his stay in Philadelphia, leading the league in runs scored four times, doubles once, triples three times, and home runs three times. The accumulation of home runs led to him becoming the career home run leader, overtaking Charley Jones with his 51st career homer on September 28, . He held onto the career lead for a season until he was passed for a short period of time by Dan Brouthers for the and the seasons. Stovey regained the lead, and held it until Roger Connor passed him in . =Boston and the Players' League= In , the Players' League, a rival league to the National League and the American Association, began, and it attracted many of the game's star players, including Stovey who \\"jumped\\" to the Boston Reds. He had a good season, batting .299, hit 11 triples, and 12 home runs. On September 3, 1890, Stovey became the first player to hit 100 homers for a career, off of Jersey Bakley in a game against Cleveland, a significant milestone in a day when home runs were relatively rare. =Staying in Boston= After the 1890 season, the Players' League folded with many of the players returning to their former ballclubs. Stovey‚Äö who played with the A's in 1889, was not claimed by that club through a clerical error, so on February 5, 1891, he signed with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League. He led the league that season with 16 home runs and 20 triples, while also hitting .279 with 31 doubles as well. It proved to be last great season of his career. =Baltimore / Brooklyn= Stovey played only 38 games for the Beaneaters in , before he was released on June 20, but he was quickly signed by the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the season with a .272 batting average with the Orioles and hit 11 triples, including three in one game on July 21 in a 10‚Äì3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. The season was Stovey's last season in the majors. He was released by the Orioles on May 22 after only eight games, and was signed three days later on May 15 by the Brooklyn Grooms. He finished the season with Grooms and retired after the season was over. =Career statistics= In 1489 games over 14 seasons, Stovey posted a .288 batting average (1775-for-6153) with 1495 runs, 348 doubles, 176 triples, 122 home runs, 912 RBI, 509 stolen bases, and 664 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .943 fielding percentage playing the outfield and first base. Post-career After his career, Stovey returned to New Bedford, Massachusetts where he had begun his baseball career, in order to manage the local amateur team in 1893. He subsequently worked as a police officer in the city. Stovey died at the age of 80 in New Bedford, and is interred at Oak Grove Cemetery.

Patents evolved from letters patent, issued by the monarch to grant monopolies over particular industries to skilled individuals with new techniques. Originally intended to strengthen England's economy by making it self-sufficient and promoting new industries, the system gradually became seen as a way to raise money (through charging patent-holders) without having to incur the public unpopularity of a tax. Elizabeth I particularly used the system extensively, issuing patents for common commodities such as starch and salt. Unrest eventually persuaded her to turn the administration of patents over to the common law courts, but her successor, James I, used it even more. Despite a committee established to investigate grievances and excesses, Parliament made several efforts to further curtail the monarch's power. The result was the Statute of Monopolies, passed on 29 May 1624. The statute repealed some past and future patents and monopolies but preserved exceptions: one of these was for patents for novel inventions. Seen as a key moment in the evolution of patent law, the statute has also been described as \\"one of the landmarks in the transition of [England's] economy from the feudal to the capitalist\\". Even with the statute in force, it took over a century for a comprehensive legal doctrine around patents to come into existence, and James I's successor Charles I regularly abused the patents system by ensuring that all cases relating to his actions were heard in conciliar courts, which he controlled. The English Civil War and the resulting English Restoration finally curtailed this system. The statute is still the basis for Australian law, and until the United Kingdom began following the European Patent Convention in 1977, was also a strong pillar of the United Kingdom's intellectual property law. Background Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law developed around patents.Pila (2001) p.210 This practice came from the guilds, groups who were controlled by the Crown and held monopolies over particular industries. By the 14th century the economy of England was lagging behind that of other European nations, with the guilds too small to control industrial production successfully. To remedy this, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering \\"letters of protection\\" that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The first recorded letter of protection was given in 1331. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as an extended passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade.Klitzke (1959) p.624 An exceptional example (considered the first full patent in England) was issued to John of Utynam on 3 April 1449, granting him a monopoly.Klitzke (1959) p.627 Overseas, the practice of granting full industrial patents and monopolies became common in Italian states by the 1420s.Pila (2001) p.211 Over the next century, the granting of full industrial patents became a more common practice in England; the next record is a letter from 1537 to Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's private secretary, from Antonio Guidotti, a Venetian silk-merchant. Guidotti had persuaded a group of Venetian silk-makers to practice in England, and wanted the king to grant him letters patent protecting their monopoly to grow silk for 15 or 20 years. This was granted, and Henry's son Edward VI followed up with a grant of letters patent to Henry Smyth, who hoped to introduce foreign glassworking techniques into England. This process continued after Elizabeth I came to the throne, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies.Pila (2001) p.212 The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch, both before and after the Statute of Monopolies, because of the potential for raising revenue. A patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest as a result of the patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.Ramsey (1936) p.7 Over time, this became more and more problematic; instead of temporary monopolies on specific, imported industries, long-term monopolies came about over more common commodities, including salt and starch. These \\"odious monopolies\\" led to a showdown between the Crown and Parliament, in which it was agreed in 1601 to turn the power to administer patents over to the common law courts;Pila (2001) p.213 at the same time, Elizabeth revoked a number of the more restrictive and damaging monopolies.Ramsey (1936) p.8 Even given a string of judicial decisions criticising and overruling such monopolies, James I, Elizabeth I's successor, continued using patents to create monopolies. Despite the Committee of Grievances, a body chaired by Sir Edward Coke that abolished a large number of monopolies, a wave of protest occurred at the expansion of the system. On 27 March 1621, James suggested the House of Commons draw up a list of the three most objectionable patents, and he would \\"give Life to it, without alteration\\", but by this time a statute was already being prepared by Coke.Kyle (1998) p.206 After passing on 12 May 1621 it was thrown out by the House of Lords, but a Statute of Monopolies was finally passed by Parliament on 29 May 1624.Klitzke (1959) p.649 Act =Sections 1‚Äì5= Section 1 said that: Crucially, this rendered all past, present and future patents and monopolies null and void. Patents were normally divided into three categories; patents for a particular invention, patents exempting a patent-holder from legislation, and patents for a particular trade or industry. Section 1, however, for the first time discussed a new category of patents; those \\"of Power, Liberty or Faculty\\". These patents were normally used in relation to penal laws, to \\"farm out\\" the business of administering to criminals and dispensing justice to private companies and individuals. The statute, in a break from previous law, emphasised that this power lay only within Parliament.Dent (2009) p.441 Section 2 provided that all future patents granted should be determined by the common law, and not otherwise, while Section 3 emphasised that companies and individuals now or in the future in possession of patents should not be allowed to exercise them. Sections 4 and 5 provided that if anyone was interfered with 40 days after the Statute of Monopolies was passed due to a patent or monopoly, any goods seized or persons imprisoned would be returned to their owners and released respectively. =Sections 6‚Äì9= Court of King's Bench, which the Statute of Monopolies explicitly exempted from its limitations on penal administration The most important part of the statute is Section 6, which lays out the exceptions to the rules preventing any kind of monopoly or patent. It stated that the previous provisions: Essentially, this established a wide area in which patents could be granted, on the condition that monopolies lasted no longer than 14 years. These patents would apply to any new \\"manner\\" of \\"manufacture\\", with \\"manufacture\\" referring both to the creation of an object, and the design for that object.Pila (2001) p.214 Section 7 provided that the Act did not prejudice or overrule any previous statutory measures, while Section 8 provided that the restoration to Parliament of the power to administer penal law did not in any way infringe upon the right of the king, Court of King's Bench, Court of Common Pleas or other criminal courts to order someone's imprisonment. Section 9 provided that the rejection of letters patent and licenses did not extend to corporations over towns, such as the City of London Corporation.Nachbar (2005) p.1352 Significance Charles I, who continued abusing the patents system even after the Statute of Monopolies The statute is worded \\"strongly and broadly\\", and other than the exceptions mainly repeated the existing common law.Nachbar (2005) p.1351 The statute has long been considered a key moment in patent law; Chris Dent, writing in the Melbourne University Law Review, identifies it as \\"a significant marker in the history of patents\\" with continuing importance, although it is neither the start nor end of patent law.Dent (2009) p.416 Despite the statute, the courts did not develop a comprehensive and coherent legal doctrine for patent law for more than a century after the statute came into force.Mossoff (2001) p.1276 Not only is it highly important within patent law, it also played a large role in economics; G. A. Bloxam, writing in the Journal of Industrial Economics, identifies the passage of the Statute of Monopolies as \\"one of the landmarks in the transition of [England's] economy from the feudal to the capitalist\\".Bloxam (1957) p.157 As well as being significant in relation to patent law, Whig historians have also identified it as the first infringement upon the monarch's Royal Prerogative, and one of the first occasions in which the self-confident House of Commons overruled the king, eventually leading to the English Civil War.Kyle (1998) p.203 Chris R. Kyle, writing in the Journal of Legal History, notes that this is not the case; not only did the Statute of Monopolies only restate the previous common law, leading to no infringement upon the Royal Prerogative, James I was in the later stages of the bill supportive of its principles.Kyle (1998) p.216 James I was not opposed to the motion; during the 1621 session of Parliament, he voided several monopolies (included those for silver thread and inns), and both James and the Privy Council were active during the passage of the bill to ensure it was supported.Kyle (1998) p.217 The statute required extensive judicial action to make it work, particularly on the interpretation of Section 6. Sir Edward Coke, in his Institutes of the Lawes of England, wrote that The subject was also discussed in Bircot's Case, where it was decided that an inventive improvement to an existing industry or invention was not a new \\"material\\", and could not be patented; such an improvement was described as \\"to put but a new button to an old coat\\".Pila (2001) p.216 Hasting's Case confirmed that a patent would not be issued, even for a new \\"material\\", that was extremely close to an old one, something originally laid down in Matthey's Case.Pila (2001) p.217 The statute did not stop the monarch issuing such patents in return for money; after James I's death, Charles I continued issuing them and avoided having to obey the law by having any cases heard in the conciliar courts, such as the Star Chamber. In response to this abuse and others, the Star Chamber was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640.Nachbar (2005) p.1353 After the English Restoration, these activities largely ceased because of the dominant power of Parliament and the Bill of Rights 1689, which completely abolished the king's ability to disobey or alter statute.Nachbar (2005) p.1354 The Statute of Monopolies dominated patent law for centuries; it was received into the laws of many common law jurisdictions and still forms the basis for the modern patent laws of those countries: for example, the patent law of Australia is dominated by the Patents Act 1990, which states that one test for if something is patentable is if it relates to \\"a manner of manufacture within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies\\".Dent (2009) p.415 In England and Wales, some sections of the statute are still technically in force, although the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883, Statute Law Revision Act 1948, Administration of Justice Act 1965 and Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969 repealed most of the legislation. In practice however, with the Patents Act 1977 (which brought the United Kingdom into line with the European Patent Convention), the statute has been implicitly repealed within England and Wales.Dent (2009) p.420 See also *Statute of Anne *Intellectual property *Patent References Bibliography   * * External links * Statute of Monopolies (original text, modern spelling).

By merging with the Columbus and Xenia Railroad in 1853, it created the first through-rail route from the important manufacturing city of Cincinnati to the state capital, Columbus. In this period, railroads were important for creating connections between the important waterways of the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, which were major transportation routes for products to other markets. The LMRR's importance declined later in the 19th century, after three major railroads from the East built lines across the Allegheny Mountains and established east‚Äìwest transportation systems through the state. It continued independent operations until 1981, after being absorbed by Conrail during the period of extensive railroad restructuring in the late 20th century.  History A share certificate of the Little Miami Railroad: it is unlikely that the locomotive shown was used on the railroad The Little Miami was incorporated on March 11, 1836. Its first president, who served without pay, was Jeremiah Morrow, governor of Ohio. It was the second railroad incorporated in the state of Ohio. The first meeting to sell stock was held at Linton's Hotel, Waynesville, May 13, 1836; the second on June 2, 1836 in Xenia. The railroad was originally intended to run from Cincinnati to Springfield, where it was expected meet the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, which was building south to Springfield from Sandusky on Lake Erie. At the time of incorporation, the federal National Road had not yet reached Columbus. Other than trails, the main shipping route for the Great Lakes region to the rest of the nation to the east of the Allegheny Mountains suitable for trade was via the rivers leading to the Great Lakes and from there, to points east along the Erie Canal and south on the Hudson River to the major port of New York City. Winter rendered transportation over the Alleghenies impracticable for large shipments, and the Erie Canal was subject to freezing. The only alternative winter shipping route to points east was a lengthy circuitous southern route by riverboat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans for transhipment east. The entire regions adjacent to the Great Lakes lacked waterway access to the Ohio River for shipment of their products. Ohio had a rather extensive network of canals under construction by this time, to provide such access, but their waters also froze in winter. The Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad was projected to run from Sandusky on Lake Erie south to a proposed interchange at Springfield, where trains could be shifted to the Little Miami to proceed to Cincinnati. This would provide the Great Lakes region and its products with year-round access to the rest of the nation, as access to any of the ships then sailing on the Great Lakes meant access to the proposed railroad link to the Ohio River. The proposal that the two railroads would closely cooperate was projected to result in one of the major trade routes of the era, and of particular importance during winter months. = Cincinnati to Milford and Loveland constructed = On December 14, 1841, the first train ran from Cincinnati to Milford, a distance of along the Little Miami River, and preparations had been made to lay rails north along the river to Fosters. Additional track was opened to Loveland the next year. = Opened to Waynesville = The road's surveyors ran a route along the Little Miami River past Kings Mills to South Lebanon, up Turtle Creek to Lebanon, Ohio, and thence to Waynesville. However, at a grade of to the mile, it was too steep for current locomotives. The city of Lebanon pleaded for the company to reconsider, but the route was instead laid along the river to what would become the towns of Morrow, Fort Ancient (where the gorge is deep and where the Jeremiah Morrow Bridge today stands), Mathers Mills, Oregonia, and to Waynesville (which was on the opposite shore). This country is still sparsely populated. Had the directors waited a few years, more powerful locomotives that could climb the grades would have been available. = Opened to Xenia = The road was pushed northward and the line to Xenia, the seat of Greene County, opened in August 1845. = Completion to Springfield = The road was completed to Springfield and inaugurated on August 10, 1846, bringing the total route-miles of its main line to . This resulted in Springfield having railway service before the state capital Columbus. By this time, the National Road had also reached Springfield. The Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad had encountered difficulties in raising capital, and construction was delayed for three years in reaching Springfield. This postponed the completion of the link between the Great Lakes area and the Ohio River. The railroad's terminus at Springfield was of little importance prior to completion of the second railroad. The company found favorable conditions to build a line to Columbus diverging from the Little Miami mainline at Xenia, and its management worked to organize the Columbus and Xenia Railroad. From Xenia, a connection was built to link to the Columbus and Xenia Railroad, its partner. The two companies combined their operations, but did not formally merge, on November 30, 1853. By 1856, the Little Miami had of track, and the C&X; had . The two lines formed the only rail link between Cincinnati and the state capital at the time. = 1850s upgrades and shift in transportation patterns = The Little Miami Railroad's Car Shops and Roundhouse at Pendleton, Ohio, around 1854 Revenues from local agricultural shipments were promising enough to enable the line to upgrade to heavier rails and make other improvements during the 1850s. By this time, the line gained the reputation for being one of the best-run lines in the nation. But by 1853, the first of the three railway systems from the Eastern Seaboard that would be built across the Alleghenies and reach Ohio had linked up with the growing railway network in place in Ohio. It became possible to travel from western Ohio to points in the East. Ultimately the New York Central Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad all reached Ohio from the East. The Hillsboro and Cincinnati Railroad was chartered in 1846 to run a line between Hillsboro and O'Bannon Creek in Loveland on the Little Miami's route. By 1850, the H&C; had completed the to Hillsboro. The H&C; would lease its line in perpetuity to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad; this ultimately became the mainline of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the area. The new construction upended the established trade routes in Ohio, which had been along a north‚Äìsouth axis to get goods or passengers either to Lake Erie or the Ohio River. The Lake Erie and Mad River Railroad had reached Springfield in 1849, but within a few years, as trans-Allegheny railroads reached into Ohio, they supplanted that line in importance. The most important traffic pattern shifted irrevocably to an east‚Äìwest-oriented axis. The mainline of the Little Miami Railroad beyond Xenia to Springfield declined in importance to a branch. The Little Miami maintained its Columbus route, but looked to the West when projecting for the future. = Growth through mergers = The Columbus & Xenia Railroad's Big Darby Bridge, around 1854. The Little Miami Railroad leased in perpetuity all assets of the C&X; on March 18, 1869, while the C&X; continued to exist as a separate corporation. At that time, the LMRR had of track and the C&X; . It would later acquire of Dayton and Western Railroad track by lease in 1864 and from the Dayton and Xenia Railroad. The Little Miami joined the Cincinnati and Indiana Railroad in 1862 in building track along the riverfront in Cincinnati to link their two depots. The LMRR and the C&X; together bought the Dayton, Xenia and Belpre Railroad in January 1865. = Absorbed into the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis RR = On February 23, 1870, the Little Miami Railroad leased in perpetuity, renewable forever, all of its assets, including the DX&P;, the D&W;, and the C&X;, to the Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway, retroactive to December 1, 1869. The rent was $480,000 per year. The PC&St.L; was part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Pennsy co-signed the lease, guaranteeing the payments and other conditions. At the time of the lease, the LMRR system consisted of of track. The system had cost $3,995,165 in track, right-of-way, and facilities, plus $1,065,968 in rolling stock, machinery, and a boat on the Ohio River. On August 28, 1890, the PC&St.L.; merged with several other railroads to emerge as the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway. On the Little Miami River between Kings Mills, Ohio and South Lebanon was Middletown Junction. Here the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad track met the LMRR. The Lake Erie and Mad River Railroad, initially considered a company for a close relationship with the Little Miami, was absorbed into the competing New York Central system. The Little Miami's most serious competitor, the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (1895‚Äì1917), became part of the competitive Baltimore and Ohio system. =From PRR to Conrail= The LMRR continued to exist as a separate corporation although much of the stock was owned by the Pennsy. In the mid-20th century, there was extensive railroad restructuring following changes in the industry, which had been affected by the expansion of trucking and use of passenger automobiles following construction of the interstate highway system. When the Pennsy's successor, the Penn Central company, collapsed into bankruptcy in 1970, the LMRR was still active. It was absorbed by Conrail and merged out of existence December 23, 1981. The rails were subsequently lifted. In the late 20th century, the right-of-way was converted into the Little Miami Bike Trail.

Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 105-6. The Classic Oz Books Jack first appeared as a main character in the second Oz book by Baum The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904). Jack's incredibly tall and skinny figure is made from tree limbs and jointed with wooden pegs. He has a large carved jack-o'-lantern for a head which is where he gets his name (unlike most jack-o'-lanterns, the seeds and other pumpkin guts were not removed so it substitutes for his brain). Jack was made by a little boy named Tip to scare his guardian, an old witch named Mombi. From Mombi's chest he took some old clothes for Jack; purple trousers, a red shirt, a pink vest with white polka dots, and stockings, to which he added a pair of his shoes. When Mombi saw Jack, she almost smashed him to pieces. Instead, she decided to test her new Powder of Life on him. The powder worked and Jack came to life. Jack is not known for his intelligence which seems to depend on the quality and number of the seeds in his pumpkin-head at that time. However he manages to come up with random bits of wisdom and common sense often. For example, after bringing Jack to life, Mombi has the following exchange with him: :Even Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought to life; for, after staring at him intently, she presently asked: :\\"What do you know?\\" :\\"Well, that is hard to tell,\\" replied Jack. \\"For although I feel that I know a tremendous lot, I am not yet aware how much there is in the world to find out about. It will take me a little time to discover whether I am very wise or very foolish.\\" Although Jack Pumpkinhead would not get tired from walking, his joints would still wear out. To remedy this, Tip created the Sawhorse to serve as Jack's mode of transportation. By the end of the second Oz book, Tip, who was originally born Ozma, is changed back into a female by the same magic that made him male. Jack notes that he no longer has a father. In the fifth Oz book The Road to Oz (1909), Jack has settled in a large pumpkin-shaped house near the Tin Woodman's castle in Winkie Country. Jack spends much of his time growing pumpkins to replace his old heads, which eventually spoil and need to be replaced. Princess Ozma, now recognized as his mother, carves new heads for Jack when necessary. The old heads are buried in a graveyard on his property. In the sixth Oz book The Emerald City of Oz (1910), it is revealed that Jack designed a five-storey, jewel-encrusted, corn-shaped mansion for the Scarecrow to live in. In Thompson and Neill In the continued series after Baum's death in 1919, Jack Pumpkinhead had to wait until the 23rd Oz book to get a book named after himself along with the starring role. Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz was written by Ruth Plumly Thompson, the writer who continued the Oz books after the death of L. Frank Baum. In the book, Peter (the little-boy baseball pitcher from Philadelphia), while reminiscing about his previous visit to Oz, suddenly finds himself landing right into Jack Pumpkinhead's front yard in the Winkie Country. Peter and Jack set off together for the Emerald City, but take a wrong turn, ending up traveling through the Quadling Country. At one point in the book, Peter combats darkness by lighting a candle and placing it in Jack's empty head. Jack notes that it makes him feel \\"brighter,\\" but also \\"A little light headed.\\"Ruth Plumly Thompson, Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz, Reilly & Lee, 1929; Chapter 2. John R. Neill includes Jack in his final Oz book, The Runaway in Oz.John R. Neill, The Runaway in Oz, edited by Eric Shanower; New York, Books of Wonder, 1995. In both the Thompson and Neill books, Jack loses his head for varying periods of time; In Neill, his headless stick body is dragged about the countryside of Oz by his companions. In comics Jack Pumpkinhead was one of the Freedom Fighters in the 1995 comic book Oz, created by Ralph Griffth, Stuart Kerr, and Bill Bryan, and published by Caliber Comics. Jack was killed during the company-wide crossover, Daemonstorm, after having been possessed by one of the demons. Jack also appears in the comic book The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles, created by Ben Avery and Casey Heying, which is published twice a year by Buy Me Toys. In Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series a handyman figure named Mervyn Pumpkinhead, clearly modeled on Jack, works for Morpheus in the Dreaming, painting and building dreams. In issue 101 of Fables, Bufkin the winged monkey finds his way back to Oz's neighboring country Ev. He runs across Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and Bungle, and upon hearing of their resistance to the Nome King, pledges to lead them in revolution. This is an allusion to the Baum novel Ozma of Oz and/or the comics series Oz mentioned above. In film Jack was one of the main characters in The Wonderful Land of Oz (1969), Journey Back to Oz (1974), Dorothy in the Land of Oz (1980), and Return to Oz (1985). Portrayals Jack Pumpkinhead was first portrayed on stage by Hal Godfrey in the 1905 stage play, The Woggle-Bug by Baum and Frederic Chapin. The play failed in Chicago and was never revived or recast. Bronson Ward, Jr. played the role in the 1908 film, The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays. Although photographs suggest something more realistic than the makeup worn by Godfrey was used for the film, the popular character makes no appearances in the productions of The Oz Film Manufacturing Company. George Wadsworth plays \\"Jack the Pumpkinhead\\" in Barry Mahon's The Wonderful Land of Oz (1969). Without a first name, Jack appears, voiced by Paul Lynde, in the animated movie sequel Journey Back to Oz (which had a different outcome for the character). Carl Beck played Jack Pumpkinhead in the original production of The Marvelous Land of Oz by Thomas W. Olson, Gary Briggle, and Richard Dworsky. The Minneapolis production was presented on television and home video. Robert Ridgely voices Jack Pumpkinhead in the 1980 Thanksgiving special Dorothy in the Land of Oz. Stewart Larange, an exceptionally thin actor, portrayed Jack in the live-action movie Return to Oz (1985) while Brian Henson was the animatronic puppeteer and provided his voice. Ross Maplettoft who played Jack Pumpkinhead Sr. in the animated TV series The Oz Kids (1996-1997) He has a son named Jack Pumpkinhead Jr. His son likes to adventure with his friends. Viktor Sukhorukov provided the voice of Jack Pumpkinhead in the 2000 Russian adaptation of The Marvelous Land of Oz, Adventures in the Emerald City: Princess Ozma. Gerran Howell portrayed Jack in the NBC series Emerald City. Jack Pumpkinhead appears in the animated series Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz voiced by JP Karliak. First appearing in \\"Halloween Heist,\\" Jack was created by Wilhelmina to give Dorothy and her friends a scare on Halloween. However, he is too simple-minded and friendly to be scary.

It mainly held political prisoners throughout World War II. Prominent prisoners include Joseph Stalin's oldest son Yakov Dzhugashvili, assassin Herschel Grynszpan, Paul Reynaud the penultimate Prime Minister of France, Francisco Largo Caballero Prime Minister of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, the wife and children of the Crown Prince of Bavaria, Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, and several enemy soldiers and political dissidents. Sachsenhausen was a labor camp outfitted with several subcamps, a gas chamber, and a medical experimentation area. Prisoners were treated harshly, fed sparingly, and killed openly. Those held captive in Sachsenhausen were the men and women which the Third Reich wanted dead, not just because of their religion, but because of their political beliefs and their power over those who listened to them. After World War II, when Oranienburg was in the Soviet Occupation Zone, the structure was used by the NKVD as NKVD special camp Nr. 7. Today, Sachsenhausen is open to the public as a memorial for the crimes committed within its walls. Sachsenhausen under Nazi Germany Forced labor The camp was established in 1936. It was located north of Berlin, which gave it a primary position among the German concentration camps: the administrative centre of all concentration camps was located in Oranienburg, and Sachsenhausen became a training centre for Schutzstaffel (SS) officers (who would often be sent to oversee other camps afterwards). Initially, the camp was used to perfect the most efficient and effective execution method for use in the death camps. Given this, executions obviously took place at Sachsenhausen, especially of Soviet prisoners of war. During the earlier stages of the camp's existence the executions were done by placing the prisoner in a small room, often even with music playing, called the Genickschussbaracke and told they were to have their height and weight measured but were instead shot in the back of the neck through a sliding door located behind the neck.\\"The Extraordinary Life of Mike Cumberlege SOE by Robin Knight This was found to be far too time-consuming so they then trialled a trench, killing either by shooting or by hanging. While this more easily enabled group executions, it created too much initial panic among the prisoners, making them harder to control. So, still not happy, they then started doing small scale trials of what would go on to become the large scale, infamous, death camp gas chambers. These trials were successful and showed them that this method was \\"the one\\" as it facilitated the means to kill the largest number of prisoners, without \\"excessive\\" initial panic. So by September 1941, when they were conducting the first trials of this method at Auschwitz, Sachsenhausen had already been the scene of \\"some gassings in conjunction with the development of gas vans\\".\\"The gas Chamber at Sachsenhauden\\" The prisoners were also used as a workforce, with a large task force of prisoners from the camp sent to work in the nearby brickworks to meet Albert Speer's vision of rebuilding Berlin. Camp layout Main entrance The Main gate or Guard Tower \\"A\\", with its 8mm Maxim machine gun, the type used by the Germans in the trenches of World War I, housed the offices of the camp administration. On the front entrance gates to Sachsenhausen is the infamous slogan Arbeit Macht Frei (\\"work makes (you) free\\"). About 200,000 people passed through Sachsenhausen between 1936 and 1945. Anchoring the base of the triangular shaped thousand-acre site was the large Appellplatz, where tens of thousands of prisoners would line up for morning and evening roll call. Creating a semi circular configuration, were the barracks of custody zone which fanned out from the base of the Appellplatz. Sachsenhausen was intended to set a standard for other concentration camps, both in its design and the treatment of prisoners. The camp perimeter is, approximately, an equilateral triangle with a semi circular roll call area centered on the main entrance gate in the boundary running northeast to southwest. Barrack huts lie beyond the roll call area, radiating from the gate. The layout was intended to allow the machine gun post in the entrance gate to dominate the camp, but in practice it was necessary to add additional watchtowers to the perimeter. The standard barrack layout was to have a central washing area and a separate room with toilet bowls and a right and left wing for overcrowded sleeping rooms. There was an infirmary inside the southern angle of the perimeter and a camp prison within the eastern angle. There was also a camp kitchen and a camp laundry. The camp's capacity became inadequate and the camp was expanded in 1938 by a new rectangular area (the \\"small camp\\") northeast of the entrance gate and the perimeter wall was altered to enclose it. There was an additional area (Sonderlager) outside the main camp perimeter to the north; this consisted of two huts Sonderlager 'A' and 'B' built in 1941 for special prisoners that the regime wished to isolate. Custody zone The camp was secure and there were few successful escapes. The perimeter consisted of a stone wall on the outside. Within that there was a space that was patrolled by guards and dogs; it was bordered on the inside by a lethal electric fence; inside that was a gravel \\"death strip\\" forbidden to the prisoners. Any prisoner venturing onto the \\"death strip\\" would be shot by the guards without warning. Officers would also force prisoners to cross this strip at gun point and threaten to kill them if they did not; the prisoner would cross the death strip and be killed anyway. Rewards such as extra leave were offered to guards who successfully shot and killed any prisoner who entered into the death zone. Slave labour Brickworks prisoners Sachsenhausen was the site of Operation Bernhard, one of the largest currency counterfeiting operations ever recorded. The Germans forced inmate artisans to produce forged American and British currency, as part of a plan to undermine the British and American economies, courtesy of Sicherheitsdienst (SD) chief Reinhard Heydrich. Over one billion pounds in counterfeit banknotes were recovered. The Germans introduced fake British ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£20 and ¬£50 notes into circulation in 1943: the Bank of England never found them. Plans had been made to drop British pounds over London by plane. Today, these notes are considered very valuable by collectors. An industrial area, outside the western camp perimeter, contained SS workshops in which prisoners were forced to work; those unable to work had to stand at attention for the duration of the working day. Heinkel, the aircraft manufacturer, was a major user of Sachsenhausen labour, using between 6,000 and 8,000 prisoners on their He 177 bomber. Although official German reports claimed the prisoners were \\"working without fault\\", some of these aircraft crashed unexpectedly around Stalingrad and it is suspected that prisoners had sabotaged them. Other firms included AEG and Siemens. Prisoners also worked in a brick factory, which some say was supposed to supply the building blocks for Hitler's dream city, Welthauptstadt Germania, which was to be the capital of the world once the Nazis took over. Prisoner abuses Camp punishments could be harsh. Some would be required to assume the \\"Sachsenhausen salute\\" where a prisoner would squat with his arms outstretched in front. There was a marching strip around the perimeter of the roll call ground, where prisoners had to march over a variety of surfaces, to test military footwear; between were covered each day. Prisoners assigned to the camp prison would be kept in isolation on poor rations and some would be suspended from posts by their wrists tied behind their backs (strappado). In cases such as attempted escape, there would be a public hanging in front of the assembled prisoners. Prisoners of war were made to run up to 40 km a day with heavy packs, sometimes after being given performance-boosting drugs like cocaine, to trial military boots in tests commissioned by shoe factories.Philip Ball.

Available online: Weapon research Clothing stolen from prisoners There have also been allegations of an experimental drug tested upon unwilling inmates in 1944 designated \\"D-IX\\" at the Sachsenhausen facility. Designed to increase stamina and endurance, this drug, supposedly consisting of a cocktail of cocaine, methamphetamine (Pervitin), and oxycodone (Eukodal),D-IX was designed to see use from members of the Wehrmacht, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe to enhance mission performance where longevity and exhaustion become pertinent issues. While these drugs were used in their individual forms by all branches of the German military, the nature and use there of D-IX specifically (especially experimentation upon Sachsenhausen prisoners) lacks enough substantiation to be considered credible, though experiments by the Nazis upon unwilling prisoners utilizing psychoactive compounds is far from myth, and could hardly be ruled outside the realm of plausibility. Seven men of the British Army's No. 2 Commando, captured after the highly successful Operation Musketoon, were executed at Sachsenhausen. They were shot on 23 October 1942, five days after Adolf Hitler issued his commando order calling for the killing of all captured members of commando units. Four SOE agents led by Lt Cdr Mike Cumberlege RNR, who took part in the 1943 Operation Locksmith in Greece intended to blow up the Corinth Canal and were captured in May 1943, were held in Sachsenhausen's infamous Zellenbau isolation cells for more than a year before being executed in February/March 1945. Survivors of Operation Checkmate, a 1942 commando anti-shipping operation in Norway, including their leader, John Godwin, RN, were held at Sachsenhausen until February 1945, when they were executed. Godwin managed to wrestle the pistol of the firing party commander from his belt and shot him dead before being himself shot. The Zellenbau contained about 80 cells and included some of World War II's most persistent Allied escapees as well as German dissidents, Nazi deserters and nationalists from East Europe such as the Ukrainian leader Tara Bulba-Borovets who the Nazis hoped to persuade to change sides and fight the SovietsT. Bulba-Borovets, Army Without a State: a Memoir - Winnipeg, 1981) Aftermath At least 30,000 inmates died in Sachsenhausen from causes such as exhaustion, disease, malnutrition and pneumonia, as a result of the poor living conditions. Many were executed or died as the result of brutal medical experimentation. Over the course of its operation, over 100 Dutch resistance fighters were executed at Sachsenhausen. Dutch Freemasons were also sent to the camp including the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of the Netherlands, Hermannus Van Torgeren, who died there in March 1940, after being arrested by Klaus Barbie. The Dutch subsequently sought the extradition from Czechoslovakia of Anton√≠n Z√°potock√Ω, who became President of Czechoslovakia, for his alleged role in the murder of Dutch prisoners during his time as a kapo at the camp. According to an article published on 13 December 2001 in The New York Times, \\"In the early years of the war the SS practiced methods of mass killing there that were later used in the Nazi death camps. Of the roughly 30,000 wartime victims at Sachsenhausen, most were Russian prisoners of war\\".At his war crimes trial in 1947 the last camp commandant, Anton Kaindl, acknowledged 42,000 deaths during his time in charge 1942-45. The exact figure will never be known as all camp records were destroyed before Soviet forces liberated Sachsenhausen in April 1945. Recreation of the security perimeter at Sachsenhausen Arbeit Macht Frei gate Sachsenhausen gate Arbeit macht frei Many women were among the inmates of Sachsenhausen and its subcamps. According to SS files, more than 2,000 women lived in Sachsenhausen, guarded by female SS staff (Aufseherin). Camp records show that there was one male SS soldier for every ten inmates and for every ten male SS there was a woman SS. Several subcamps for women were established in Berlin, including in Neuk√∂lln. Sachsenhausen female guards included Ilse Koch, and later Hilde Schlusser. Anna Klein is also noted for her presence at the camp. Towards the end of the war, 13,000 Red Army POWs arrived at Sachsenhausen. Over 10,000 were executed in the camp by being shot in the back of the neck through a hidden hole in a wall while being measured for a uniform. Their bodies were then incinerated in a crematorium. With the advance of the Red Army in the spring of 1945, Sachsenhausen was prepared for evacuation. On 20‚Äì21 April the camp's SS staff ordered 33,000 inmates on a forced march northwest. Most of the prisoners were physically exhausted and thousands did not survive this death march; those who collapsed en route were shot by the SS. The march ended near Raben Steinfeld on 2 May, when 18,000 remaining prisoners were liberated by tanks of the 2nd Belorussian Front. On 22 April 1945 the camp's remaining 3,000 inmates were liberated by the Red Army and the Polish Army's 2nd Infantry Division. =Camp commanders= * Michael Lippert, July 1936 ‚Äì October 1936 * Karl-Otto Koch, October 1936 ‚Äì July 1937 * Hans Helwig, July 1937 ‚Äì January 1938 * Hermann Baranowski, February 1938 ‚Äì September 1939 * Walter Eisfeld, 1939‚Äì1940 * Hans Loritz, 1940‚Äì1942 * Albert Sauer, 1942‚Äì1943 * Anton Kaindl, 1943‚Äì1945 War crimes trial Fifteen of the concentration camp's officials, including Anton Kaindl, the former commandant, the SS camp doctor, Heinz Baumk√∂tter, and two former prisoner kapos, including Paul Sakowski, who had served as an executioner, were brought to trial, on 23 October 1947, before a Soviet Military Tribunal in Berlin. On 1 November 1947, all seventeen were found guilty; fourteen were given life sentences with hard labor, including Kaindl, Baumk√∂tter and Sakowski, and two were sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment with hard labor. NKVD special camp Nr. 7 In August 1945, NKVD special camp Nr. 7 was moved to the area of the former concentration camp. Nazi functionaries were held in the camp, as were political prisoners and inmates sentenced by Soviet Military Tribunals. By 1948, Sachsenhausen, now renamed \\"Special Camp No. 1\\", was the largest of three special camps in the Soviet Occupation Zone. The 60,000 people interned over five years included 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps. Others were Nazi functionaries, anti- Communists and Russians, including Nazi collaborators. By the time the camp was closed in the spring of 1950, at least 12,000 had died of malnutrition and disease. With the fall of the communist East Germany it was possible to conduct excavations in the former camps. At Sachsenhausen, the bodies of 12,500 victims were found; most were children, adolescents and elderly people. The Sachsenhausen camp today Plaque to honour Dutch resistance fighters executed at Sachsenhausen After the Soviets ceased to use Sachsenhausen as a concentration camp the site was used, for some years, by East Germany's \\"Kasernierte Volkspolizei\\", notionally a police division and in reality a precursor of the country's own National People's Army, which was formally established in 1956. 1956 was also the year in which planning began to adapt the concentration camp site as a national memorial. This was inaugurated four years later on 23 April 1961. The first director of the renamed \\"Sachsenhausen National Memorial Site\\" (\\"Nationale Mahn- u. Gedenkst√§tte Sachsenhausen\\") was Christian Mahler, at one time a senior police officer, who back in the Nazi period had been an inmate at Sachsenhausen between 1938 and 1943. The plans involved the removal of most of the original buildings and the construction of an obelisk, statue and meeting area, reflecting the outlook of the East German government of that time. The government of East Germany emphasised the suffering of political prisoners over that of the other groups detained at Sachsenhausen. The memorial obelisk contains eighteen red triangles, the symbol the Nazis gave to political prisoners, usually communists. There is a plaque in Sachsenhausen built in memory of the Death March. This plaque has a picture of malnourished male prisoners marching, all of whom are wearing the red triangle of a political prisoner. , the site of the Sachsenhausen camp, at Strasse der Nationen 22 in Oranienburg, is open to the public as a museum and a memorial. Several buildings and structures survive or have been reconstructed, including guard towers, the camp entrance, crematory ovens and the camp barracks. After German reunification, the camp was entrusted to a foundation that opened a museum on the site. The museum features artwork created by inmates and a high pile of gold teeth (extracted by the Germans from the prisoners), scale models of the camp, pictures, documents and other artifacts illustrating life in the camp. The administrative buildings from which the entire German concentration camp network was run have been preserved and can also be seen. Following the discovery in 1990 of mass graves from the Soviet period, a separate museum has been opened documenting the camp's Soviet-era history, in the former Sonderlager. Arson damage caused to this barrack building has been covered in glass to protect it, whilst still showing the damage to those visiting the camp The compound has been vandalized by Neo- Nazis several times. In September 1992, barracks 38 and 39 of the Jewish Museum were severely damaged in an arson attack. The perpetrators were arrested, and the barracks were reconstructed by 1997. However, it is important to note that the decision was taken that no buildings built during the Nazi regime will be rebuilt on the site. The destroyed section of the huts are now a Jewish museum with the surviving section left as it was immediately after the fire with the paint still blistered from the flames. Sites within Sachsenhausen and Dachau which had been approved for inclusion in the augmented reality smartphone game Ingress were removed in July 2015; Gabriele Hammerman, director of the memorial site at Dachau, told the Deutsche Presse- Agentur that Google's actions were a humiliation for victims and relatives of the Nazi camps, and Niantic Labs' founder John Hanke stated that \\"we apologize that this has happened.\\" See also *List of subcamps of Sachsenhausen *List of Nazi concentration camps *International concentration camp committees Footnotes References * Photo * web site of the *  Further reading  * * Andrea Riedle: Die Angeh√∂rigen des Kommandanturstabs im KZ Sachsenhausen.

It was released by Atlantic Records in April 1999. Background The album was written by Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger with the intention of emulating albums with a strong thematic story inspired by its surroundings, such as Muswell Hillbillies by The Kinks and Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen. According to Schlesinger, \\"When we were teenagers, we liked listening to Kinks records because we'd never been to England, and we got a sense of what it was like to live there. We really wanted to make a record that felt whole. We intentionally didn't include a few good songs because once we started picking up on the thematic connections, we wanted to stick with it.\\" Collingwood added, \\"It had to do with reaching a level of maturity where you realize your own life is worth singing about. We spent so much time glamourizing bands like the Kinks, but what they were singing about was just everyday suburbia in England. There's this realization that you don't have to sing about Kensington for it to be worthwhile.\\" In terms of musical direction, the band opted to evoke songs and bands that had an ubiquitous nature when they were younger. According to Schlesinger, \\"Musically, the stuff on the record is like picking through all the songs that people our age weren't about to avoid growing up. It could be Loverboy, Steve Miller, the Cars, Journey. You don't even know if you like it or hate it; it just pops into your head. Sometimes when we're arranging a song we all remember something at the same time so we'll throw it in there. It's not even really conscious.\\" Collingwood's songwriting contributions on this album - including \\"Troubled Times\\", \\"A Fine Day for a Parade\\" and \\"\\"Amity Gardens\\" - tended to be more serious than Schlesinger's. According to Collingwood, \\"I think I was a little panicky after the first record as being perceived as a novelty band. So I was trying to move away from making jokes on this record. That's why my contributions are more dismal.\\" This is also the first Fountains of Wayne album to feature guitarist Jody Porter and drummer Brian Young, who joined the band after Collingwood and Schlesinger had finished recording the debut album almost entirely on their own. According to Collingwood, \\"The new album was definitely recorded more like a band. We had been touring with them for over a year after making the first record, and it felt like second nature when we made the new record and it sounded the way the band sounds. The progression from the first record to the second was so gradual that I didn't really notice until I went back and listened to the first album and realized it really didn't sound like a band.\\" Cover The album is named after a major street that connects the neighborhoods of Utopia and Beechhurst in the Queens borough of New York City, and its street sign is featured on the album cover. According to Schlesinger, \\"The name is so evocative. It ties in all these different places and characters because there's such a sense of longing about it.\\" Details Dropped by Atlantic after sales failed to meet expectations, the band had a growing dispute with the company after it put no effort into promoting the album's single \\"Troubled Times\\". Reception Utopia Parkway was named an \\"Album of the Week\\" by People Magazine in 1999 upon its release, but received mixed reviews from music press with some claiming the album showed the band \\"lacked depth\\" while others declared it a \\"masterpiece from the moment you first hear it\\". The album contains two fan favorite songs from the Fountains' live performances: \\"Red Dragon Tattoo,\\" about a boy who gets a tattoo to impress a girl, and \\"Denise,\\" a faux-grunge power-pop confection where the songwriters show their intentionally bad and comic writing with \\"She works at Liberty Travel/ She's got a heart made of gravel.\\" \\"Troubled Times,\\" originally written by Collingwood when he and Schlesinger were in a previous incarnation of Fountains of Wayne called Pinnwheel, is also a fan favorite. \\"Red Dragon Tattoo\\" was featured prominently throughout the Stephen King mini- series Kingdom Hospital. The 2008 Dar Williams album Promised Land includes a cover of \\"Troubled Times\\".

Webb did not accept nomination to be reelected as chairman at the 30th National Convention in 2014, at which John Bachtell was elected the party's new chairman. Webb continued to serve on the party's National Committee until 2016 when he renounced his party membership and joined the Democratic Party. Biography Samuel Webb was born in Maine and graduated from St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1967. He holds an M.A. in economics from the University of Connecticut. He worked as a Communist Party organizer in Michigan from 1978-1988. Webb led the CPUSA when it made the decision to support some Democratic candidates in the 2004 presidential election. While the Party regarded both major parties as two capitalist entities in a collaborative dictatorship for established financial institutions, it believed that rule by the Democrats was preferable to rule by the Republicans, arguing that the latter puts the interests of working people in considerable danger. During the 2008 election, Webb called President Obama a \\"people's advocate\\" and said that some of his early decisions, in reversing some of President George W. Bush's policies, were praiseworthy. In 2005 Webb wrote Reflections on Socialism, a paper reflecting ideas that Webb first presented at the 2005 Left Forum in New York City. This paper points out that socialism is once again being discussed in the trade union and student movements, in popular magazines and certainly in the halls of power worldwide.Reflections on Socialism, Communist Party USA, June 4, 2005. Webb traveled to China,Margolis, Dan. \\"CPUSA Delegation returns from China, Vietnam\\". People's Weekly World. December 22, 2006; retrieved December 14, 2011 at CPUSA website Britain, Cuba, and Vietnam, in order to meet communist and socialist leaders. On February 4, 2011 Webb published an essay in the Communist Party magazine Political Affairs, \\"A Party of Socialism in the 21st Century: What It Looks Like, What It Says, and What It Does\\". It set forth positions that came under sharp criticism from Communist parties across the world, as well as a portion of CPUSA members, as being revisionist, social democratic, and anti-Communist. These parties included the Communist Parties of Canada, Mexico, Germany and Greece as well as the CPUSA Houston club, the Austin Hogan Transit Club of NYC, the CPUSA Tucson Club, the LA Metro Club, and the Communist Party of San Francisco. In 2014, Webb did not seek reelection as the National Committee's chairman and stepped down from office. At the 30th National Convention of the Communist Party USA, John Bachtell was elected as the new Chairman of the National Committee, thereby ending Webb's 14 years as the party's leader. In 2015, Webb resigned from the National Committee and renounced his party membership, declaring himself to be in favor of liquidating the party. He came out in full support of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary and condemned Bernie Sanders and his supporters for breaking the unity of the Democratic Party.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 8, 2011 tributary of the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Big South Fork and the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The New River rises on Frozen Head, a notable mountain of Morgan County, Tennessee. Named for its frequent winter appearance, Frozen Head is the focal point of Frozen Head State Park and Natural Area. Draining an area of Pennsylvanian Period rock that has been subjected to extensive strip mining for coal, the upper reaches of the stream have at times been subject to heavy pollution. The stream initially trends northeast. The upper portion of the course is paralleled by State Route 116. It soon crosses into a remote area of Anderson County, and then into Campbell County. At this juncture, State Route 116 turns to the southeast to follow the Ligias Fork, and the road paralleling the New River becomes a small county road. The stream trends generally north from this point for several miles, and is also paralleled by a railroad constructed primarily for the purposes of coal transport. The stream, road, and railroad cross into Scott County. Several miles into Scott County, the stream begins a westerly trend. It drains an area developed by the petroleum industry as an oil field, and is crossed by U.S. Highway 27 at the community of New River. Just downstream of this community is the boundary of the Big South Fork National Recreational Area.

Its title refers to an observation by the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's 1892 short story \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\". Haddon and The Curious Incident won the Whitbread Book Awards for Best Novel and Book of the Year, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book, and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize. Unusually, it was published simultaneously in separate editions for adults and children. The novel is narrated in the first-person perspective by Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy who describes himself as \\"a mathematician with some behavioural difficulties\\" living in Swindon, Wiltshire. Although Christopher's condition is not stated, the book's blurb refers to Asperger syndrome, high-functioning autism, or savant syndrome. In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that \\"Curious Incident is not a book about Asperger's... if anything it's a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. The book is not specifically about any specific disorder,\\" and that he, Haddon, is not an expert on autism spectrum disorder or Asperger syndrome. The book uses prime numbers to number the chapters, rather than the conventional successive numbers. Originally written in English, it has been translated into 36 additional languages. Plot Christopher John Francis Boone is a fifteen- year-old boy who is implied to be on the autism spectrum, who lives with his father, Ed. He explains in his narration that his mother, Judy, died two years ago. The boy discovers the dead body of the neighbour's dog, Wellington, speared by a garden fork. Mrs. Shears, the dog's owner, calls the police, and Christopher comes under suspicion. When a policeman touches him, Christopher is uncomfortable with being touched and hits the policeman. He is arrested, then released with a police caution. He decides to investigate the dog's death, despite his father's orders to stay out of other people's business. He is severely limited by his fears and difficulties when interpreting the world around him. Throughout his adventures, Christopher records his experiences in a book, which he calls a \\"murder mystery novel\\". During his investigation, Christopher meets people whom he has never before encountered, even though they live on the same street, including the elderly Mrs. Alexander, who informs Christopher that his mother had an affair with Mr. Shears and had been with him for a long time. Ed discovers the book and confiscates it after a brief argument with the boy. While searching for the confiscated book, Christopher uncovers a trove of letters which his mother wrote to him, dated after her supposed death, which his father has also hidden. He is so shocked by his father lying about his mother's death that he is unable to move, curls up on the bed, vomits and groans for several hours until his father returns home. Ed realizes that Christopher has read the letters and cleans him up. He then confesses that he had indeed lied about Judy's death; he also admits that he was the one who had killed Wellington, stating that it was a mistake resulting from his anger after a heated argument with Mrs. Shears. Christopher, having lost all trust in his father and convinced that his father might try to kill him, decides to run away to live with his mother. He remembers his mother's address from the letters and embarks on an adventurous trip to London, where his mother lives with Mr. Shears. After a long and event-filled journey, evading policemen and feeling ill from the overwhelmingly large amount of information and stimuli from the trains and crowds around him, he finally finds his way to the home of his mother and Mr. Shears, and waits outside until they arrive. Judy is delighted that Christopher has come to her; she is upset that Ed told Christopher that she was dead. Mr. Shears does not want Christopher living with them, and never did. Very soon after arriving, Christopher wants to return to Swindon in order to take his mathematics A-level. His mother leaves Mr. Shears, their relationship having broken down because of the rejection of Christopher by Mr. Shears. Judy then moves into a rented room in Swindon. After an argument with Ed, she agrees to let him meet Christopher for daily brief visits. Christopher remains terrified of his father and makes repeated attempts to prevent him from talking. He hopes Ed will be imprisoned for killing Wellington, although his mother explains that for this to happen, Mrs. Shears would have to press charges. The story ends with Ed getting Christopher a Golden Retriever puppy, who Christopher gets to name, and promising that he will rebuild trust with Christopher slowly, \\"no matter how long it takes\\". Christopher asserts that he will take further A-level exams and attend university. He completes his mathematics A-level with top grades despite having eaten and slept very little. Earlier in the story he talks about wanting to become an astronaut, but at the end he declares that his goal is to become a scientist. The book ends with Christopher optimistic about his future, having solved the mystery of the murdered dog, gone to London on his own, found his mother, written a book about his adventures, and achieved an A in his A-level maths exam.  Characters  ; Christopher John Francis Boone: The protagonist and narrator of the novel, who investigates the murder of Mrs. Shears' dog Wellington, a large black poodle, has many behavioural issues attached to his ASD. ; Ed Boone: Christopher's father, a boiler engineer. Prior to the beginning of the story, he has been living with Christopher as a single parent for two years. ; Judy Boone: Christopher's mother. Early in the book, Christopher writes that she died of a heart attack two years before the book's events, but he later discovers that his father lied about this. ; Siobhan: Christopher's paraprofessional and mentor at school. She teaches him how society works and how to behave within its complex guidelines. ; Roger Shears: One of the neighbours who lived near the Boones, but who has left his wife before the story begins. ; Eileen Shears: Mr. Shears's wife, who attempts to console Ed for a time after Christopher learns of his mother's death. She is Wellington's owner. ; Mrs. Alexander: An old lady, who is one of Christopher's neighbours, who offers information to help Christopher's investigation regarding his parents and Mr. and Mrs. Shears. ; Mr. Jeavons: Christopher's psychologist. ; Rhodri: Ed Boone's employee. ; Toby: Christopher's pet rat. ; Wellington: Mrs. Shears' large black poodle, which Christopher finds dead in her garden, with a garden fork sticking out of him.  Themes  = Social disability = In a June 2003 interview with NPR's Terry Gross on her program Fresh Air, Haddon said about Christopher: Haddon states on his website that, although he had read \\"a handful of newspaper and magazine articles about, or by, people with Asperger's and autism\\" in preparation for writing the book, he knows \\"very little\\" about Asperger's syndrome and that Christopher Boone is inspired by two different people. According to Haddon, none of these people can be labelled as having a disability. Haddon added that he \\"slightly regret[s]\\" that the term Asperger's syndrome appeared on the cover of his novel. In 2010, in an interview with The Independent, he was described as \\"now thoroughly irritated that the word Asperger's appeared on subsequent editions of the novel, because now everyone imagines that he is an expert and he keeps getting phone calls asking him to appear at lectures.\\" In a critical essay on the novel, Vivienne Muller quotes some praise by experts on disability theory: \\"In its presentation of Christopher's everyday experiences of the society in which he lives, the narrative offers a rich canvas of experiences for an ethnographic study of this particular cognitive condition, and one which places a positive spin on the syndrome. The reader in this instance acts as ethnographer, invited to see what Mark Osteen claims is a 'quality in autistic lives that is valuable in and of itself'.cited in [S.] Adams (2005) p. 1 Along similar lines, [Alex] McClimens writes that Haddon's novel is 'an ethnographic delight' and that 'Haddon's achievement is to have written a novel that turns on the central character's difference without making that difference a stigmatising characteristic'.\\"cited in [S.] Adams (2005) p. 24 Muller adds that the novel \\"works with a strong sense of the disabled speaking subject, drawing readers into Christopher's cognitive / corporeal space through an incremental layering of his perspectives and reactions ... The narrative also bristles with diagrams, maps, drawings, stories, texts that inform Christopher's lexicon for mapping meaning in a world of bewildering signs and sounds.\\" She also admires such elements as \\"the digressive stream-of- connectedness-and-disconnectedness way in which Christopher writes and thinks; the obsessive focus on minutiae; his musings about why animals behave the way they do; his quasi philosophizing on death and life and the afterlife; his ambition to be an astronaut ...\\" In a survey of children's books which \\"teach about emotional life,\\" Laura Jana wrote, \\"On the one hand, this is a story of how an undeniably quirky teenage boy clings to order, deals with a family crisis, and tries to make sense of the world as he sees it. But it also provides profound insight into a disorder ‚Äì autism ‚Äì that leaves those who have it struggling to perceive even the most basic of human emotions. In so doing, The Curious Incident leaves its readers with a greater appreciation of their own ability to feel, express, and interpret emotions. This mainstream literary success made its way to the top of The New York Times bestseller list for fiction at the same time it was being touted by experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism-spectrum disorder as an unrivaled fictional depiction of the inner workings of an autistic teenage boy.\\" =Metaphor= Christopher often comments on his inability to appreciate some metaphors. He gives as an example a quote that he found in \\"a proper novel\\": \\"I am veined with iron, with silver, and with streaks of common mud. I cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus.\\" Haddon told Terry Gross, \\"Funnily enough, it's actually a quote from Virginia Woolf. It's Virginia Woolf on an off day, in the middle, I think, of The Waves. An author whom I love actually, but who sometimes got a little too carried away.\\"  Reception  = Awards = The book was joint winner of the 2004 Boeke Prize, won the 2003 Whitbread Book of the Year award and sold more than two million copies. Haddon also was one of the winners of the 2004 Alex Awards, which \\"honor the 10 top adult books with appeal for adolescents.\\" As well as winning the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, Haddon earned the Book Trust teenage fiction award. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was also long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and \\"many observers were surprised that it did not advance to the shortlist.\\" John Carey, chairman of the Booker panel of judges, told The Guardian, \\"We have several clashes of opinion among the judges but I found Haddon's book about a boy with Asperger's syndrome breathtaking.\\" = Critical reaction = A survey in Great Britain, conducted by the BBC's literacy campaign for World Book Day, found Curious Incident to be among \\"the top five happy endings, as voted on by readers\\" in novels (the others were Pride and Prejudice, To Kill a Mockingbird, Jane Eyre and Rebecca, the last of which Curious outranked). School Library Journal praised it as a \\"rich and poignant novel.\\" The San Jose Mercury News said, \\"Haddon does something audacious here, and he does it superbly. He shows us the way consciousness orders the world, even when the world doesn't want to be ordered,\\" adding that \\"the great achievement of this novel is that it transcends its obvious cleverness. It's more than an exercise in narrative ingenuity. Filled with humor and pain, it verges on profundity in its examination of those things‚Äîcustoms, habits, language, symbols, daily routines, etc.‚Äîthat simultaneously unite and separate human beings.\\" A reviewer for The Christian Century described it as \\"an absorbing, plausible book\\": \\"The reader becomes absorbed not only in the mystery of a murdered dog and a missing mom, but also in the mysterious world of an autistic child.\\" A reviewer for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that the story is \\"a touching evolution, one that Haddon scripts with tenderness and care... a unique window into the mind of a boy who thinks a little differently, but like many kids his age, doesn't quite know how to feel.\\" Professor Roger Soder called it \\"visceral\\" and a \\"delightful story,\\" declaring, \\"All of us in our Spokane Book Club are special education professionals and so have considerable experience with kids with this disability, and we found the story believable.\\" In 2019, the book was ranked 19th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. = Medical professionals' reviews = Alex McClimens, whom Muller quoted above, also wrote, \\"This magnificent essay in communication is compulsory reading for anyone with the slightest interest in autistic spectrum disorders. This book is also required reading for those who simply enjoy a fascinating story... we are offered a first person narrative to match anything by contemporary writers. Mark Haddon has created a true literary character and his handling of the teenage Asperger's heroic adventure is brilliantly crafted. He uses the literal mind-set of his hero to mask the true direction of the plot.\\" Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book \\"a fairly ripping adventure story\\" and writes, \\"It's also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere‚Äîan unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator‚Äîbut it has its own beauty, and it works. So persuasive and so effective is the construction of Christopher, not only is he a character you're rooting for, he's also the character in the story you understand the best. It's startling how believably and comfortably this story puts you into what you might have thought were likely to be some pretty alien shoes.\\" Reviewer David Ellis, naming Curious Incident an \\"ambitious and innovative novel,\\" wrote that Haddon \\"manages to avoid the opposing pitfalls of either offending people with autism and their families or turning Christopher into an object of pity. Instead of becoming the focus of the plot, the autism enhances it. The unemotional descriptions amplify many moments of observational comedy, and misfortunes are made extremely poignantly.\\" He concludes that Christopher's story is \\"far more enjoyable and likely to stay with you for far longer than any medical textbook.\\"  Adaptations  = Stage = A stage adaptation, by Simon Stephens and directed by Marianne Elliott, premiered at the National Theatre on 2 August 2012.

On December 13, 1982, White became the regular hostess. White is signed as a hostess of Wheel of Fortune until 2022. The handprints of Vanna White in front of Hollywood Hills Amphitheater at Walt Disney World's Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park On November 8, 2019, Sony Pictures Television announced that White will take over hosting Wheel of Fortune as emcee starting with the week of episodes which are slated to air starting on December 9, 2019. The announcement was made after a taping day was postponed after Pat Sajak was hospitalized with emergency surgery in order to clear a blocked intestine. White hosted that taping day and the subsequent rescheduled taping day the next day. Guest letter activators were implemented during her shows hosting; the weeks of December 9 and 16 had Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and other Disney characters during the Secret Santa Holiday Giveaway. The costumed Disney characters do not actually touch the game board; it was entirely automated during their guest hosting. Subsequently, the show went on hiatus during Christmas week (December 23, 2019) and then a week of previously-taped \\"America's Game\\" episodes (Wheel tapes six episodes per day, with each studio audience receiving three shows each; the third show in the afternoon session is an \\"America's Game\\" episode) that Sajak hosts, before White returned to hosting on January 6, 2020 for a final week; she was assisted by a \\"special guest\\", Pat Sajak's daughter Maggie. Fully recovered from his surgery, Sajak returned to the show on December 5, 2019 with episodes to be broadcast beginning on January 13, 2020. = Real estate investing = White uses her income to invest in apartment buildings, and she likes flipping houses. In 2017, she listed her Beverly Hills home for $47.5 million. = Crochet and knitting endorsements = At the age of five, her grandmother taught her how to crochet. She had lost interest in the hobby over time until, on the Wheel of Fortune set, she noticed her pregnant hairdresser was crocheting a baby blanket for herself. White told her that she previously crocheted and asked the hairdresser to help her relearn crochet. When she has downtime on the set, she often crochets, as she finds it very relaxing and she has something to show for the time she's spent doing it. White began her relationship with Lion Brand Yarns when she spoke about her love of crochet on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson; the yarn company subsequently contacted her and negotiated a contract. She has her own line of yarn called Vanna's Choice and endorses crochet and knitting books published in her name. = World record = White is famous for her quick and seamless revealing of letters on the game board, an infectious smile, and constant clapping in support of each episode's contestants. On the May 24, 2013 episode of Wheel of Fortune, White was presented with a Guinness World Record certificate for most frequent clapper. As of January 31, 2013, it was estimated she clapped at least 3,480,864 times across the show's 30 seasons. She had appeared in all but 10 of Wheel's 5,754 episodes to that point, during the show's modern syndicated run, which began on September 19, 1983. That works out to an average number of 606 claps per show.  Personal life  She was baptized a Baptist and identifies herself as a Christian. White dated Playgirl centerfold/Chippendales-dancer-turned-actor John Gibson in the 1980s, and they eventually became engaged. In 1986, Gibson was killed in a plane crash. White married restaurant owner George Santo Pietro in December 1990. White first became pregnant in September 1992, and announced her pregnancy on an episode of Wheel of Fortune where \\"Vanna's pregnant\\" was the answer to a puzzle. She miscarried shortly after the episode's taping. White later had a son, Nicholas, born in 1994 and a daughter, Giovanna (Gigi), born in 1997, from her marriage to Santo Pietro. The couple divorced in November 2002. From 2004 to 2006, she was engaged to Southern California businessman Michael Kaye. The two never wed. In a conversation with Larry King, she indicated that her mother had told her that her uncle was actor Christopher George. According to White, although George was not a biological relation of hers, her mother grew up with his family and, years later in Los Angeles, he and his wife took her under their wing. Also, in that same conversation, she said that her kids come to Wheel of Fortune taping a lot, especially her daughter Giovanna, who appeared with her more times than anyone else in the show. = Philanthropy = White is a patron of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, donating $1.8 million to the program and plans to continue her philanthropic works after her retirement from television.  Litigation  In 1993, White sued Samsung Electronics over its use of an advertisement featuring a robot turning letters on a game show, alleging a violation of her personality rights. The lower court's decision in Samsung's favor was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which denied a rehearing, and Judge Alex Kozinski issued a dissent. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. A jury ultimately awarded White $403,000 in damages.

He was the American Independent Party vice presidential nominee under John G. Schmitz in 1972 and the American Party presidential nominee in 1976. Early life Thomas Jefferson Anderson was born in Nashville, Tennessee; the second of five children of William Joseph and Nancy Lou Anderson. After graduating from Baylor School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Anderson attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1934. At Vanderbilt he excelled in athletics, earning varsity letters as a member of both the varsity tennis and track teams. He was business editor of the school's yearbook, The Commodore, and served on the student newspaper staff. Anderson was elected president of his fraternity, Phi Delta Theta. In 1936, he married the former Carolyn Montague Jennings of Franklin, Tennessee. Miss Jennings, also a graduate of Vanderbilt University, was elected \\"Miss Vanderbilt\\" during her senior year. They had one daughter, Carol, who now resides in Raleigh, North Carolina. After graduation, he sold securities for several Nashville-based brokerage firms including J. C. Bradford & Company and also worked as an ad-salesman for the Southern Agriculturist. He was a veteran of World War II, having served as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. Publishing In 1947, Anderson purchased The Arkansas Farmer, the first of sixteen regional farm magazines he acquired and operated as part of Nashville- based Southern Unit Publications, Inc. Additionally, he became publisher and editor of The Farm and Ranch Magazine, a nationally circulated monthly publication based in Dallas, Texas. Anderson was the supervising editor and author of the column Straight Talk which appeared in the magazines and was reprinted in more than 375 newspapers. In 1957, a series of the columns was reprinted in a book, also titled Straight Talk. He later produced a weekly radio program of the same name. He spent much of his life as a speaker, publisher and writer, crusading for conservative causes. He won numerous patriotic awards including the Liberty Award of the Congress of Freedom and the Freedom Award of Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.. Political involvement In 1972, he was the American Independent Party vice presidential nominee, appearing on the ticket with U.S. Representative John G. Schmitz, a former Republican from California. The duo finished third in the popular vote with 1,100,868 votes. In 1976, he was the American Party's presidential nominee on a ticket with Rufus Shackelford. They finished sixth in the general election with 158,271 votes. The campaign received its best results in Virginia, where Anderson-Shackleford received 16,686 votes. The ticket also finished third in three states: Kentucky, North Dakotahttps://vip.sos.nd.gov/pdfs/Abstracts%20by%20Year/1970%20through%201978%20Statewide%20Election%20Results/1976/General%20Election%2011-02-1976.pdf and Indiana. In 1978, Anderson ran as the American Party-endorsed candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee, but victory went to Republican Howard Baker, Jr. who won his third and final term in the chamber. He appeared on the ballot as an independent due to state law which requires a minimal number of signatures to appear as an independent but requires a full party petition consisting of tens of thousands of signatures to appear on ballot with party label. Anderson received 45,908 votes. Later life Anderson remained active in conservative politics and was widely popular as a speaker, appearing on various TV and radio programs and delivering more than 1,500 speeches between 1947 and 1994. He lived his later years in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Blowing Rock, North Carolina. He was known for a great sense of humor: in some circles he was called \\"a modern-day Will Rogers,\\" in others \\"the barefoot wit of the John Birch Society.\\" One of his most famous aphorisms was \\"Politicians are like cockroaches: It's not what they steal and carry away; it's what they fall into and mess up.\\" A colleague of Anderson's wrote: \\"Tom Anderson is not a common man. He is of the uncommon stock that conceived and created this republic. He is deeply devoted to the principles proclaimed in the U.S. Constitution. Tom Anderson is unaffected, practical and poetic. If you want style and daring with the kick of a Tennessee mule, then Thomas Jefferson Anderson is your man. A smile. A grin. An earnest patriot. A shot of adrenalin in sluggish patriot veins. By example of his life as well as by his word, Tom Anderson has made a permanent contribution to the literature and liberty under law.\\" Anderson liked to tell the following story \\"A farmer was being plagued by a group of wild hogs. He decided to capture them one by one. He built a corral in the woods leaving an opening for an enclousure. Next he put corn in front of the corral. At first none of the hogs showed any interest. Finally some of the young ones begin to go up and smell it and then run back to the herd. Finally one on them took an ear of corn and ran back and ate it. Slowly the other hogs did the same. Each day the farmer put the corn a little closer to the corral with the same results by the hogs. At last he placed the corn inside the corral. As they were inside eating he gradually completed the enclousure, board by board, and the hogs didn't even notice because they were inside eating the free corn. Finally he finished the gate and locked it. The hogs tried to get out, but he had 'em. FELLOW HOGS, WE'VE BEEN FENCED.\\" . Anderson was a past president of the American Agricultural Editors Association. He and his wife were two of thirteen charter members of St. Paul's Southern Methodist Church in Nashville. Anderson died on August 30, 2002 in Raleigh, North Carolina. He is interred at the Mount Hope Cemetery in Franklin, in Williamson County, Tennessee.

He played 15 years in Major League Baseball, principally as a catcher, with the Milwaukee Grays (49 games, 1878), Worcester Ruby Legs (51 games, 1880), Detroit Wolverines (625 games, 1881‚Äì1888) and Boston Beaneaters (337 games, 1889‚Äì1893). He played on four pennant-winning teams, one in Detroit and three in Boston, and is one of only two players (the other being Ned Hanlon) to play with the Detroit Wolverines during all eight seasons of the club's existence. Bennett compiled a .256 batting average and a .340 on-base percentage during his major league career with 549 runs scored, 203 doubles, 67 triples, 55 home runs and 533 runs batted in (RBIs). His greatest value, however, was as one of the greatest defensive players of his era. Between 1880 and 1891, he ranked among the National League leaders 10 times in Defensive Wins Above Replacement (Defensive WAR) at all positions and led the league's catchers seven times in fielding percentage and three times in double plays and putouts. Bennett's baseball career ended in January 1894 when he lost both legs in a train accident in Kansas. In 1896, Detroit's new baseball stadium was named Bennett Park in his honor. The Detroit Tigers played their home games at Bennett Park from 1896 through the 1911 season. Bennett has also been credited with inventing the first chest protector, an improvised cork-lined vest that he wore under his uniform. Early years Bennett was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1854. His father, Silas Bennett (1815‚Äì1887), was a native of Connecticut. His mother, Catherine (Nichols) Bennett, was a native of Pennsylvania. Charlie was the eighth of their 11 children.1870 U.S. Census entry for Silas and Catherine Bennett residing in New Castle, Penn. Son Charles, age 14, born in Pennsylvania.

Death 24 Feb 1927 in Detroit, Wayne, Michigan, USA. Parents Silas Bennett (1815‚Äì1887) and Katherine Nichols (1815‚Äì1882). Professional baseball player =Neshannock= Bennett began his career in organized baseball as the catcher for the Neshannock team in the Pennsylvania League. Sources are in conflict as to how long Bennett played for Neshannock, one account indicating he was on the Neshannocks' \\"pay roll for two seasons\\", and others stating that he played for the Neshannocks in 1874, 1875 and 1876. Bennett was described while playing for the Neshannocks as a hard hitter who \\"nearly broke the directors of the club because of the number of balls knocked into the Shenango river.\\" While playing for Neshannock, Bennett was the catcher for Cal Hawk, one of the pitching stars of the early 1870s. =Detroit Aetnas= At the end of the 1876 season, at age 22, Bennett signed with the Detroit Aetnas. The Aetnas were originally an amateur baseball team, but the club signed several professional players at the end of the 1876 season to aid in a rivalry with the Cass Club of Detroit. The professional players signed by the Aetnas included three members of the Neshannock team‚ÄîBennett, George Creamer and Ned Williamson. Bennett's first appearance for the Aetnas was on September 21, 1876, against the Boston Red Stockings at the Woodward Avenue grounds in Detroit. Bennett played third base in the game and, in the first inning, hit a \\"hot one\\" that glanced off the pitcher and continued into center field for a triple that drove in a run. The Aetnas' professional players, including Bennett, remained until the end of the season and were \\"stranded\\" in Detroit \\"without a dollar\\", until a \\"benefit was given and enough money realized to pay their way home.\\" =Milwaukee Grays= Some sources state that Bennett signed with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1877 and played in one game for that team. He ultimately signed a contract to play in 1877 for the Milwaukee club at a salary of $150 per month. During Bennett's first season with Milwaukee, the team was part of the League Alliance, which has been classified as a minor league. The following year, the Milwaukee club was admitted to the National League and became the Milwaukee Grays. Bennett made his major league debut on May 1, 1878, and appeared in 49 games, 35 as a catcher and 20 in the outfield. He compiled a .245 batting average for the Grays with 16 runs scored and 12 RBIs. His battery-mate, Sam Weaver lost 31 games that season. =Worcester Ruby Legs= Bennett caught the first perfect game in MLB history, thrown by Lee Richmond (pictured) in 1880. In 1879, after the Milwaukee club disbanded, Bennett joined the Worcester Ruby Legs, a team organized and managed by Frank Bancroft. The team played in the National Association, which has been rated as having been a minor league in 1879. Bennett began at Worcester as a backup catcher to Doc Bushong, but eventually replaced Bushong. Bennett hit .328 in 42 games during the 1879 season. During the winter of 1879-1880, Bancroft took his team, including Bennett, on a baseball tour of Cuba and the Southern United States. Bennett stayed in New Orleans and played for local baseball teams there until the 1880 season began. In 1880, Worcester was admitted to the National League, replacing the Syracuse Stars, and attaining major league status. That season, Bennett appeared in 51 games, 45 of them as the team's catcher. Bennett caught for Lee Richmond, baseball's first left-handed pitching star. Richmond compiled a 32-32 record in 1880, and also pitched the first perfect game in major league history, with Bennnett catching. Bennett had a .228 batting average with 20 runs scored and 18 RBIs during the 1880 season. Defensively, he ranked second among the National League's catchers with a .913 fielding percentage and fifth in putouts and range factor. =Detroit Wolverines= At the end of the 1880 season, Bancroft, who had been Bennett's manager in Worcester, signed as the manager of a new Detroit baseball club that was admitted to play in the National League starting in 1881. Bancroft brought several Worcester players with him, including Bennett, George Wood, and Lon Knight. Bennett played eight seasons with the Detroit Wolverines. He was one of only two players, the other being Ned Hanlon, to play for the Wolverines during every season that the franchise existed. In his first season with Detroit, Bennett established himself as one of the best players in the National League. With a .301 batting average and a .478 slugging percentage, Bennett's overall Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating of 4.2 was the second highest among all of the league's position players, trailing only Cap Anson (5.8 WAR). He also finished among the league leaders with seven home runs (2nd), 64 RBIs (2nd), .478 slugging percentage (4th), and 32 extra base hits (4th). Bennett also excelled defensively in 1881, leading the league's catchers in putouts (418) and range factor (7.19), compiling the second highest Defensive WAR rating in the league, and setting a major league record for catchers with a .962 fielding percentage (.962). With his strong performance on both offense and defense, Bennett helped lead the Wolverines to a respectable 41-43 record in the first season of the franchise's existence. According to baseball historian Peter Morris, Bennett took the first recorded \\"curtain call\\" in baseball during the 1881 season. After hitting a home run in May 1881, Bennett was \\"loudly applauded, and the crowd would not desist until he bowed in acknowledgment.\\" In 1882, Bennett had another strong season, batting .301 and compiling a 4.1 WAR rating that ranked sixth in the league among position players. He also ranked among the league leaders with a .450 slugging percentage (6th), 10 triples (10th), and five home runs (4th). Defensively, he led the league's catchers with 446 putouts and a 7.94 range factor. Bennett was the Wolverines' dominant offensive player, and helped the team to its first winning record at 42-41. In 1883, Bennett hit for a career high .305 batting average, and his 4.9 WAR rating was the third highest among the National League's position players, trailing only Dan Brouthers and Jack Farrell. Bennett's defensive performance as dominant as his offense, with a 1.8 Defensive WAR rating that was the highest among catchers and the third highest among all players in the league. He also led the league's catchers with 11 double plays turned and a .944 fielding percentage. As good as Bennett was in 1883, the Wolverines team was not good, dropping to seventh place with a 40-58 record. In 1884, matters got worse for the Wolverines, as they finished in last place with a 28-84 record. Bennett's batting average fell to .264, but his on-base percentage remained high at .334, and his WAR rating remained strong at 4.1. Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in Detroit: \\"During the next four years [1882‚Äì1885] I wished many times I was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. It was awful. I thought sometimes we were lucky to finish last. Once we lost twenty-five straight games. Every week I caught a new pitcher.\\" In June 1885, the Wolverines added another slugger in Sam Thompson, and the team improved incrementally to sixth place with a 41-67 record. Bennett compiled a 4.5 WAR rating for the season, the second highest of his career and fifth highest among the league's position players. He was also among the league leaders with 42 extra base hits (4th), 47 bases on balls (5th), a .456 slugging percentage (6th), 24 doubles (6th), a .356 on-base percentage (7th), and 64 RBIs (10th). Defensively, he led the league's catchers with a 7.00 range factor and ranked second in double plays (10), fielding percentage (.919) and putouts (347). In 1886, the Wolverines added several star players and improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85-38 record. Bennett put in another solid year for the Wolverines with a .371 on-base percentage and a 3.9 WAR rating. He also compiled perhaps his best defensive season with a 2.0 Defensive WAR rating that was the highest among all players in the National League. He also led the league's catchers in fielding percentage (.955), double plays (13), and putouts (425), and ranked second in range factor (7.38). The 1887 season was the pinnacle in the history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. Bennett's WAR rating of 1.7 was the lowest during his time in Detroit, but still a respectable showing. Even though he was limited by injury to 46 games during the regular season, Bennett still finished with the sixth highest Defensive WAR rating among all players in the league and compiled a .363 on-base percentage. In his only World Series, Bennett had nine RBIs, 11 hits, and a triple, stole five bases, and scored six runs. During the 1887 season, an excursion of fans from Bennett's home town in Pennsylvania traveled to watch Bennett play in Detroit. They presented him with a wheel barrow loaded with 500 silver dollars, which Bennett then wheeled around the field \\"to the delight of 5000 people.\\" During the 1888 season, Bennett rebounded with one of the best seasons of his career. His overall 4.2 WAR rating was the third highest of Bennett's career, and his 2.2 Defensive WAR rating was the highest of his career and the second highest in the National League. Despite being the eighth oldest player in the league, he broke his own major league record with a .966 fielding percentage. The Wolverines as a whole finished in fifth place with a 68-63 record. With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines sold Bennett, Dan Brouthers, Charlie Ganzel, Hardy Richardson and Deacon White to the Boston Beaneaters for a price estimated at $30,000. =Chest protector= Bennett has been credited with inventing the first chest protector worn by catchers. According to Bennett, his wife worried about his safety as \\"a target for the speed merchants\\" and saw a need for a form of body armor to protect her husband from broken ribs. Bennett and his wife designed a homemade shield by sewing thick strips of cork between layers of \\"heavy bedticking material.\\" Out of a concern for spectators \\"roasting him for being chicken-hearted\\", he wore the device under his shirt. =Durability as a catcher= During Bennett's era, catchers lacked the protective equipment present in 20th century baseball. It was not until 1888 that specialized catcher's mitts began to be used on the non- throwing hand. As a result, catchers' hands, fingers, legs, and bodies took a beating in Bennett's time. For this reason, catchers in the era were not every-day players, needing time to recuperate after catching a game. When Bennett began his major league career, the major league record for games caught in a season was 63 games. Most catchers of the 1870s and 1880s minimized wear and tear on their hands by playing some games at other positions. For example, the three \\"catchers\\" from the era who have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame each played less than half of their games as a catcher: (1) Buck Ewing, often cited as the greatest catcher of the 19th century, played only 636 of his 1,345 games (47%) as a catcher; (2) King Kelly played only 583 of his 1,455 games (40%) at catcher; and (3) Deacon White eventually moved to third base as his regular position, finishing his career with only 458 of 1,622 games (28%) as a catcher. Bennett, on the other hand, played 954 of his 1,084 games (88%) at the catcher position.Others in Bennett's era who showed extraordinary durability, playing the vast majority of their games at the catcher position, include: Pop Snyder, 877 of 948 games (92.5%); Silver Flint, 743 of 817 games (91%); and Doc Bushong, 668 of 679 games (98.3%). Bennett's durability came not from avoiding injuries, but from playing through them. When he broke another finger during the 1887 World Series, The New York Times reported: > \\"It did not seem anything unusual to Bennett or his fingers. . . . When he > held up that battered right hand, with its fingers swollen and spread like a > boxing glove, with rags tied around three of them, and a general appearance > of having been run over by a freight-car about the entire hand, it did not > seem as though there were room to split it in any new place.\\" Accounts of Bennett's mangled or gnarled hands and fingers are common. In his book, Catcher: The Evolution of an American Folk Hero, Peter Morris cited one such account: > Bennett 'declared that only a sissy would use a padded glove with the > fingers and thumb cut off. During one of the games in which he figured a > foul ball split the left thumb of Bennett's hand from the tip right down to > the palm. The flesh was laid open right to the bone. A doctor who examined > it immediately told Bennett that it would be necessary for him to quit the > game until such time as the thumb healed sufficiently. The physician pointed > out ... that blood poisoning might set in which would cause him the loss not > only of the thumb but perhaps a hand or an arm. But despite all the doctor's > caution Bennett remained in the game catching day after day with his > horribly mangled finger. He kept a bottle of antiseptic and a wad of cotton > batting on the bench and between innings would devote his time to washing > out the wound.' Another account arises out of the 1889 pennant race. That year, Bennett played for the Boston Beaneaters in a close pennant race with the New York Giants. Bennett's hands had taken a beating while catching for John Clarkson, who won 49 games and pitched five games a week during the season. On the last day of the season, Boston had to win, and New York had to lose for Boston to finish in first place. By the sixth inning, second baseman Hardy Richardson told the manager, Jim Hart, that the ball was coming to him in a bloody state due to the condition of Bennett's hands. Bennett did not want to come out of the game, but Hart removed him over Bennett's protest, and Bennett \\"had to keep his hands in plasters for two weeks.\\" Despite the physical battering and breaking every finger on both hands, Bennett was able to continue catching for 20 years (1874‚Äì1893). His total of 954 major league games at catcher stood as the record until 1897. =Boston Beaneaters= Bennett, c. 1891, with the Boston Beaneaters After a brief dispute with the Boston management with respect to his salary, Bennett signed a contract with the club In January 1889. That year, Bennett appeared in 82 games, all at catcher. His batting average dropped to .231, his lowest tally since he was a part-time player in 1880. However, he continued to show his value defensively. Despite being the sixth oldest player in the National League, Bennett finished fifth among all players at all positions with a Defensive WAR of 1.4. He also led the league's catchers with a .955 fielding percentage, ranked second among the league's catchers with 419 putouts and third with nine double plays turned. With Bennett's assistance, Boston pitcher John Clarkson compiled a 49-19 record, and the Beaneaters finished second in the league with an 83-45 record. In 1890, Bennett remained with the Beaneaters even though he had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. As a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players' League was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year contract guaranteed by two responsible men. Some reports indicated that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid a substantial signing bonus. Bennett later described his ambivalence about the Players' League: \\"I was a Brotherhood man from the first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before the season opened I told my friends that I could not join them, so I remained with the Boston Club. When I went into the Brotherhood it was a protective order and I had no idea that they intended organizing an association of their own.\\" Bennett became the catcher for Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, Kid Nichols, in 1890, as Nichols compiled a 27-19 record while Clarkson went 26-18. The team finished in fifth place with a 76-57 record. Offensively, Bennett's production continued to decline, as he finished the 1890 season with a .214 batting average. Though he had only 60 hits, he also drew 72 bases on balls, boosting his on-base percentage to .377. Already the third oldest player in the league, Bennett nevertheless also continued to rank among the best defensive catchers. He led the league's catchers with a .959 fielding percentage and ranked fourth in putouts and double plays and fifth in assists and runners caught stealing. In 1891, Bennett appeared in 75 games, all as a catcher, for a Boston team that won the National League pennant with an 87-51 record. The team had two 30-game winners, as John Clarkson won 33 and Kid Nichols won 30. Bennett's batting average remained low at .215, but his .332 on-base percentage was significantly higher. Moreover, he led the National League in fielding percentage by a catcher for the seventh time in his career. He also led the league with 10 double plays turned by a catcher. In 1892, King Kelly took over as the Beaneaters' number one catcher. In a backup role, Bennett, at age 37, appeared in 35 games as Boston's catcher. The team continued to play well, winning its second consecutive National League pennant with a 102-48 record. In 1893, Bennett returned to his role as the team's number one catcher, appearing in 60 games at the position. In that role, he helped Boston win its third consecutive National League pennant with an 86-43 record. Bennett compiled a .209 batting average and .352 on-base percentage and appeared in what proved to be his final baseball game on September 30, 1893. =Train accident= John Clarkson, who won 49 games in 1889, was traveling with Bennett when his legs were crushed. While playing for Boston, Bennett returned each year to his home in Detroit for the off-season, and also traveled with his dog to Williamsburg, Kansas, for extended hunting trips. In 1894, Bennett was joined on his annual hunting trip by pitcher John Clarkson. On January 10, 1894, Bennett's legs were crushed by a Santa Fe Railroad passenger train in Wellsville, Kansas, while traveling from Kansas City to Williamsburg. Bennett stepped off the train to talk to an old friend who lived in Kansas and whom Bennett had arranged to greet when the train stopped at Wellsville. It was raining, and the platform was wet. When the train started moving, Bennett \\"swung around to catch the railing\\", but his foot slipped, and his left foot went over the rail. Bennett pushed his right leg against the rail to push himself back, but it also slipped and went over the track. The train's wheels ran over his left foot and right leg at the knee. That evening, doctors at the North Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Kansas, amputated Bennett's left leg just above the ankle and his right leg just above the knee. In June 1894, he was fitted with artificial limbs, but his baseball career was over. In August 1894, a benefit to raise money for Bennett was held at Boston's South End Grounds; the event included a baseball game between the Boston team and a team of collegiate players as well as foot races and other attractions. The boxing champion Gentleman Jim Corbett attended and briefly played in left field with the Boston team. The benefit was attended by nearly 9,000 people and raised $6,000 for Bennett. Bennett walked to home plate during the event, aided by crutches and artificial limbs, and bowed to the crowd \\"until the grounds fairly shook with cheers.\\" =Catching records and legacy= During his 15 years in the major leagues, Bennett set numerous fielding records. Several of those records are set forth below. * Fielding percentage. In 1882, Bennett set a major league record with a .962 fielding percentage as a catcher. He broke his own major league record in 1888 with a .966 fielding percentage. Bennett's career fielding percentage of .942 stood until 1896 as the major league career record. Bennett also led all major league catchers in fielding percentage six times; no other catcher has accomplished this feat more than four times.(Gabby Hartnett, Buddy Rosar and Sherm Lollar each led the majors four times, and Pop Snyder, Chief Zimmer, Ray Schalk and Brad Ausmus each led the majors three times.) * Putouts. In 1886, Bennett set a major league, single-season record with 445 putouts by a catcher. His career total of 5,123 putouts was also a major league record that stood until 1901. * Double plays. In 1887, Bennett broke the career record for most double plays turned as a catcher. His final career total of 114 double plays was the major league record until 1900. *Games played. Bennett's career total of 954 games at catcher stood as the major league record until 1897. Sports writer Tim Murnane in 1894 declared Bennett \\"unquestionably the greatest back stop the game ever produced, taking his throwing and batting into consideration . . . Year after year Bennett led the catchers of the League and country until it seemed impossible to get a player to head him off. It made no difference to him who pitched the ball, he was there to catch it, and always with big hands. Who can remember Bennett dropping a pitched ball? Passed balls were a lost art when this man was behind the stick, and he was the ideal back stop. [Kid] Nichols always insisted on having him do his catching, saying that Bennett knew every batsman's weak points, and made easy work for the pitcher.\\" Pitcher Lee Richmond, whose perfect game Bennett caught in 1880, later stated that, among the catchers he had worked with, \\"my favorite was Charley Bennett, the best backstop that ever lived in the world. He went after everything, he knew no fear, he kept his pitcher from going into the air.\\" In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, sports historian Bill James wrote that Bennett was perhaps the best defensive catcher of the era. In comparing Bennett to Buck Ewing, James noted: \\"Buck Ewing was supposedly a brilliant catcher, but Bennett caught 50% more innings than Ewing, with a lot fewer mistakes: per 1000 defensive innings, Ewing was charged with 59 errors and 66 passed balls, while Bennett was charged with 46 errors and 43 passed balls.\\" Although James ranked Ewing ahead of Bennett as an overall player, he chose Bennett as the catcher on his Gold Glove Team for the 1880s.Bill James, New Abstract, p. 42. On the offensive side, Ewing compiled a .303 career batting average, 47 points higher than Bennett. However, with Bennett's talent for drawing walks, Ewing's career on- base percentage (.351) was only 11 points higher than Bennett (.340). Family and later years \\"Bennett in his china painting studio\\", The Seattle Press (January 24, 1908) In 1882, Bennett was married to his wife, Alice, a Vermont native. They met while Bennett was playing for Worcester. They had no children, and lived for more than 20 years at 67 Alexandria Street in Detroit,1900 U.S. Census entry for Charles W.

When Bennett first announced plans to open a cigar store, shortly after losing his legs, one woman wrote to him and said, \\"If Charley Bennett opens a cigar store in Detroit, all the ladies will commence smoking.\\" Bennett later took lessons in china painting and became quite proficient at the decorative art, first as a hobby and then as a supplemental source of income. One writer wrote that the art of china painting was \\"the last thing one would expect in the world from a man whose hands have been battered out of shape and whose every finger has been broken.\\" The Sporting News wrote: \\"It was with characteristic patience that Bennett trained his distorted fingers in the delicate art of china painting.\\" When a new ballpark was opened in Detroit in 1896, it was named Bennett Park in his honor. Bennett caught the first pitch at Bennett Park in 1896. It became a Detroit tradition for Bennett to catch the first pitch in Detroit, an honor that Bennett continued for every home opener through 1926. In November 1926, Bennett underwent surgery at Grace Hospital in Detroit to remove \\"a superorbital abscess of the face.\\" He had been ill for several months before the surgery and never fully recovered afterward, as the poison from the abscess reportedly spread through Bennett's system. Bennett died in February 1927 at age 72 at his home in Detroit. He was buried at Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit.

Born a British citizen, she now holds joint citizenship after she took United States citizenship in 2005, following her emigration in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair. By marriage, she is legally titled Lady Evans. Having been editor-in-chief of Tatler magazine at the age of 25, she rose to prominence in the American media industry as the editor of Vanity Fair from 1984 to 1992 and of The New Yorker from 1992 to 1998. She was founding editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast, serving from 2008 to 2013. As an editor, she has received four George Polk Awards, five Overseas Press Club awards, and ten National Magazine Awards. In 2000, she was appointed a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for her services to overseas journalism, and in 2007 was inducted into the Magazine Editors' Hall of Fame. Early life Tina Brown was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, and she and her elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown (who became a film producer) grew up in the village of Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. Her father, George Hambley Brown, was active in the British film industry producing the early Miss Marple films in the series starring Margaret Rutherford, based on the character created by Agatha Christie. His other films included The Chiltern Hundreds (1949); Hotel Sahara (1951), starring Yvonne De Carlo; and Guns at Batasi (1964), starring Richard Attenborough and Mia Farrow. In 1939, George had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled in 1941. He later met and married Tina's mother, Bettina Kohr in 1948, who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Bettina was of part Iraqi descent; Tina recounted, \\"She was dark and I never knew why.\\" In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in the early eighties to be with their daughter and grandchildren. She died in 1998. School In Brown's own words she was considered \\"an extremely subversive influence\\" as a child, resulting in her expulsion from three boarding schools. Offences included organising a demonstration to protest against the school's policy of allowing a change of underwear only three times a week, referring to her headmistress's bosoms as \\"unidentified flying objects\\" in a journal entry, and writing a play about her school being blown up and a public lavatory being erected in its place. University Brown entered the University of Oxford at the age of 17. She studied at St Anne's College, and graduated with a BA in English Literature. As an undergraduate, she wrote for Isis, the university's literary magazine, to which she contributed interviews with the journalist Auberon Waugh and the actor Dudley Moore. Brown's sharp, witty prose led to her being published by the New Statesman while she was still an undergraduate at Oxford. Her friendship with Waugh served as a boost to her writing career, as he used his influence to ensure that her ability was recognised. Later, she went on to date the writer Martin Amis. While still at Oxford, she won The Sunday Times National Student Drama Award for her one-act play Under the Bamboo Tree. A subsequent play, Happy Yellow, in 1977 was mounted at the London fringe Bush Theatre and was later performed at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Personal life In 1973, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh introduced Brown's writings to Harold Evans, editor of The Sunday Times and in 1974 she was given freelance assignments in the UK by Ian Jack, the paper's features editor and in the US by its colour magazine edited by Godfrey Smith. When a relationship developed between Brown and Evans, she resigned to write for the rival The Sunday Telegraph. Evans divorced in 1978 and, on 20 August 1981, he and Brown married at Grey Gardens, the East Hampton, New York, home of The Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn. They lived together in New York City until Evans' death on September 23, 2020. They had two children: a son, George, born in 1986, and a daughter, Isabel, born in 1990. Evans was knighted in 2004. Career =Early work= After graduating, while doing freelance reporting, Brown was invited to write a weekly column by the literary humour magazine, Punch. These articles and her freelance contributions to The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph earned her the Catherine Pakenham Award for the best journalist under 25. Some of the writings from this era formed part of her first collection Loose Talk, published by Michael Joseph. In 1979, at the age of 25 Brown was invited to edit the tiny, almost extinct society magazine Tatler by its new owner, the Australian real estate millionaire Gary Bogard and transformed it into a modern glossy magazine with covers by celebrated photographers like Norman Parkinson, Helmut Newton, and David Bailey, and fashion by Michael Roberts. Tatler featured writers from Brown's eclectic circle including Julian Barnes, Dennis Potter, Auberon Waugh, Brian Sewell, Georgina Howell (whom Brown appointed deputy editor), and Nicholas Coleridge (later President of Conde Nast International). Brown herself wrote content for every issue, contributing irreverent surveys of the upper classes. She travelled through Scotland to portray the owners' stately homes. She also wrote short satirical profiles of eligible London bachelors under the pen-name Rosie Boot. Tatler covered the emergence of Lady Diana Spencer, soon to become Princess of Wales. Brown joined NBC's Tom Brokaw in running commentary for The Today Show on the royal wedding on 29 July 1981. Tatler increased its sales from 10,000 to 40,000. In 1982, when S. I. (\\"Si\\") Newhouse Jr., owner of Cond√© Nast Publications, bought Tatler, Brown resigned to become a full-time writer again. The break didn't last long and Brown was lured back to Conde Nast. This year she also hosted several editions of the long running television series Film82 for BBC1 as a guest presenter. =Vanity Fair= In 1983, Brown was brought to New York by Newhouse to advise on Vanity Fair, a title that he had resurrected earlier that year. (Vanity Fair had previously ceased publication in 1936.) Edited first by Richard Locke and then by Leo Lerman, it was dying with an unenviable circulation of 200,000 and 12 pages of advertising. She stayed on as a contributing editor for a brief time, and then was named editor-in-chief on 1 January 1984. She recalls that upon taking over the magazine she found it to be \\"pretentious, humourless. It wasn't too clever, it was just dull.\\" The first contract writer she hired was not a writer but a movie producer whom she met at a dinner party hosted by the writer Marie Brenner. The producer told her he was going to California for the trial of the strangler of his daughter. As solace, Brown suggested for him to keep a diary and his report (headlined Justice) proved the launch of the long magazine career of Dominick Dunne. Early stories such as Justice and livelier covers brightened the prospects of the magazine. In addition, Brown signed up among others Marie Brenner, Gail Sheehy, Jesse Kornbluth, T.D. Allman, Lynn Herschberg, James Kaplan, Peter J. Boyer, John Richardson, James Atlas, Alex Shoumatoff and Ben Brantley. The magazine became a mix of celebrity and serious foreign and domestic reporting. Brown persuaded the novelist William Styron to write about his depression under the title Darkness Visible, which subsequently became a best-selling nonfiction book. At the same time Brown formed fruitful relationships with photographers Annie Leibovitz, Harry Benson, Herb Ritts, and Helmut Newton. Annie Leibovitz's portrayal of Jerry Hall, Diane Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg and others came to define Vanity Fair. Its most famous cover was August 1991's of a naked and pregnant Demi Moore. Three notable stories appeared in Vanity Fair which helped the magazine gain attention and circulation: Harry Benson's cover shoot of Ronald and Nancy Reagan dancing in the White House; Helmut Newton's notorious portrait of accused murderer Claus von Bulow in his leathers with his mistress Andrea Reynolds with reporting by Dominick Dunne, and Brown's own cover story on Princess Diana in October 1985 titled The Mouse that Roared. It broke the news of the fracture in the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Those three stories from June to October 1985 saved the magazine after a year when rumors were rife that it was to be folded into The New Yorker. Thereafter sales of Vanity Fair rose from 200,000 to 1.2 million. In 1988, she was named Magazine Editor of the Year by Advertising Age magazine. Advertising topped 1,440 pages in 1991 and with circulation revenues, especially from profitable single copy sales at $20 million, selling some 55 percent of copies on the newsstand, well above the industry average sell through of 42 percent. Despite this success, occasional references later appeared to Vanity Fair losing money. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer who suggested as much in his book Power: Why Some People Have It ‚Äì And Others Don't was quickly rebutted by Bernard Leser, president of Conde Nast USA during Brown's tenure. In a letter to the editor of the Evening Standard, Leser stated Pfeffer's claim was \\"absolutely false\\" and affirmed that they had indeed earned \\"a very healthy profit.\\" Leo Scullin, an independent magazine consultant, called it a \\"successful launch of a franchise.\\" Under Brown's editorship Vanity Fair won four National Magazine Awards, including a 1989 award for General Excellence. One of her editorial decisions was in October 1990, two months after the first Gulf War had started, when she removed a picture of Marla Maples (a blonde) from the cover and replaced it with a photograph of Cher. The reason for her last minute decision, she told The Washington Post: \\"In light of the gulf crisis, we thought a brunette was more appropriate.\\"Washington Post, Thursday, 25 October 1990 ‚Äì Page D3, by Chuck Conconi =The New Yorker= In 1992, Brown accepted the company's invitation to become editor of The New Yorker, the fourth in its 73-year history and the first woman to hold the position, having been preceded by Harold Ross, William Shawn, and Robert Gottlieb. She has related in speeches that before taking over, she immersed herself in vintage New Yorkers, reading the issues produced by founding editor Harold Ross: \\"There was an irreverence, a lightness of touch as well as a literary voice that had been obscured in later years when the magazine became more celebrated and stuffy. ... Rekindling that DNA became my passion.\\" Anxieties that Brown might change the identity of The New Yorker as a cultural institution prompted a number of resignations. George Trow, who had been with the magazine for almost three decades, accused Brown of \\"kissing the ass of celebrity\\" in his resignation letter. (To which Brown reportedly replied, \\"I am distraught at your defection but since you never actually write anything I should say I am notionally distraught.\\") The departing Jamaica Kincaid described Brown as \\"a bully\\" and \\"Stalin in high heels.\\" But Brown had the support of some New Yorker stalwarts, including John Updike, Roger Angell, Brendan Gill, Lillian Ross, Calvin Tomkins, Janet Malcolm, Harold Brodkey and Philip Hamburger, as well as newer staffers like Adam Gopnik and Nancy Franklin. During her editorship she let 79 staffers go and engaged 50 new writers and editors, most of whom remain to this day, including David Remnick (whom she nominated as her successor), Malcolm Gladwell, Anthony Lane, Jane Mayer, Jeffrey Toobin, Hendrik Hertzberg, Simon Schama, Lawrence Wright, Connie Bruck, John Lahr, and editors Pamela McCarthy and Dorothy Wickenden. Brown introduced the concept of special double issues such as the annual fiction issue and the Holiday Season cartoon issue. She also cooperated with Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates to devote a whole issue to the theme Black in America. Brown broke the magazine's longstanding reluctance to treat photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon to be its first staff photographer. She also approved controversial covers from a new crop of artists, including Edward Sorel's October 1992 cover of a punk rock passenger sprawled in the backseat of an elegant horse-drawn carriage, which may have been Brown's self-mocking riposte to fears that she would downgrade the magazine. A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. During Brown's tenure, the magazine received four George Polk Awards, five Overseas Press Club Awards, and ten National Magazine Awards, including a 1995 award for General Excellence, the first in the magazine's history. Newsstand sales rose 145 percent. The New Yorker's circulation increased to 807,935 for the second half of 1997, up from 658,916 during the corresponding period in 1992. Critics maintained it was hemorrhaging money, but Newhouse remained supportive, viewing the magazine under Brown as a start-up (which routinely lose money): \\"It was practically a new magazine. She added topicality, photography, color. She did what we would have done if we invented the New Yorker from scratch. To do all that was costly. We knew it would be.\\" Under Brown, its economic fortunes improved every year: in 1995 losses were about $17 million, in 1996 $14 million, and in 1997 $11 million. In 1998, Brown resigned from The New Yorker following an invitation from Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Miramax Films (then owned by The Walt Disney Company) to be the chairman of a new multi-media company they intended to start with a new magazine, book company, and television show. The Hearst company came in as partners with Miramax. The departing verdicts after Brown's New Yorker tenure included: =Talk magazine= Tina Brown next created Talk magazine, a monthly glossy, and appointed Jonathan Burnham and Susan Mercandetti to manage Talk Books. The magazine was due to be launched during a party at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York City but was banned by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who did not feel it was an appropriate use of the site. The star-studded event mixing political leaders, writers, and Hollywood, was then moved to Liberty Island, where on 2 August 1999 more than 800 guests ‚Äì including Madonna, Salman Rushdie, Demi Moore, and George Plimpton - arrived by barge for a picnic dinner at the feet of the Statue of Liberty under thousands of Japanese lanterns and a Grucci fireworks display. An interview with Hillary Clinton in its very first issue caused an immediate political sensation when she claimed that the abuse her husband suffered as a child led to his adult philandering. The Washington Post reported that at times, \\"Talk seemed more interested in promoting such Miramax stars as Gwyneth Paltrow than in politics.\\" Despite having achieved a circulation of 670,000 Talk magazine's publication was abruptly halted in January 2002 in the wake of the advertising recession following the 9/11 attacks. It was Brown's first very public failure but she had no regrets about embarking on the project. She told Charlotte Edwardes of The Telegraph in 2002: \\"My reputation rests on four magazines ‚Äì three great successes, one that was a great experiment. I don't feel in any way let down. No big career doesn't have one flame out in it and there's nobody more boring than the undefeated.\\" Talk Media was founded in July 1998 by Miramax Films, Tina Brown and Ron Galotti to publish books and Talk magazine and produce television programs. Talk Media formed a joint venture with Heart Magazines for the magazine only in February 1999. Brown worked with the book division's editor- in chief Jonathan Burnham. She recalled in October 2017 at the time of allegations of sexual assault being made against Harvey Weinstein: \\"Strange contracts pre-dating us would suddenly surface, book deals with no deadline attached authored by attractive or nearly famous women.\\" Politico estimated that Brown had \\"bombed through some $50 million in 2 years\\" on the failed venture. A $1 million contract settlement in 2002 ended Brown's involvement in Talk Media. Talk Miramax Books flourished as a boutique publishing house until it was detached from Miramax in 2005 and made part of Hyperion at Disney. Out of 42 books published during Brown's time, 11 have appeared on the New York Times Best Seller List including Leadership by Rudy Giuliani, Leap of Faith by Queen Noor of Jordan, and Madam Secretary by Madeleine Albright. =Topic A= Brown hosted a series of specials for CNBC. The network followed up by signing her to host a weekly talk show of politics and culture titled Topic [A] With Tina Brown, which debuted on 4 May 2003. The program welcomed guests ranging from political figures, such as the Prime Minister of the UK, Tony Blair, and Senator John McCain, to celebrities, such as George Clooney and Annette Bening. Topic A struggled to find an audience on Sunday nights, airing after a day of infomercials. It averaged 75,000 viewers in 2005, about the same as The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch (79,000) and John McEnroe's McEnroe (75,000.) On being offered a lucrative deal with tight deadlines to write a book about Princess Diana, Brown resigned, airing her last Topic A interviews on 29 May 2005. =The Diana Chronicles= Tina Brown speaking at Barnes and Noble about The Diana Chronicles Brown's biography of Diana, Princess of Wales was published just before the 10th anniversary of her death in June 2007. The Diana Chronicles made The New York Times bestseller list for hardback nonfiction, with two weeks in the number one position. =The Daily Beast= On 6 October 2008, Brown teamed up with Barry Diller to launch The Daily Beast, an online news magazine that mixes original journalism with news aggregation. The website's name comes from the fictional newspaper in Evelyn Waugh's 1938 novel Scoop. The Daily Beast quoted Christopher Buckley, son of William F. Buckley, Jr., when he chose The Daily Beast rather than the magazine his father founded (National Review), to announce he could not support the Republican candidate in the 2008 presidential election: \\"Sorry, Dad, I'm voting for Obama.\\" Early references of The Daily Beast came in some awards: Online Journalism Award 2009 for Online Commentary/Blogging, Christopher Buckley; OMMA Awards 2009 Winner ‚Äì Politics; Winner ‚Äì News; MinOnline Top 21 Social Media Superstars 2009 for Tina Brown; MinOnline 2010 Best of the Web Awards: New Site (co-winner); Webby Award nominations for Best Practices and Best News 2009 In August 2010, Time's review of the 50 Best Websites of 2010 named The Daily Beast among the top five news and information sites. (The Onion at 16, The Guardian at 17, The Daily Beast at 18, National Geographic at 19, and WikiLeaks at 20) The Daily Beasts writers include Christopher Buckley, Peter Beinart, Les Gelb, Joshua DuBois, Mark McKinnon, Meghan McCain, John Avlon, Lucinda Franks, Bruce Riedel, Lloyd Grove, Tunku Varadarajan, and Reza Aslan. In a joint venture with Perseus Book Group, The Daily Beast formed a new imprint, Beast Books, that focuses on publishing timely titles of no more than 50,000 words by Daily Beast writers ‚Äì first as e-books, and then as paperbacks in as little as four months. The first Beast Book was entitled Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America by John P. Avlon. Partnering with Diane von Furstenberg, Vital Voices and the UN Foundation in 2010, The Daily Beast brought some of the world's most inspiring female leaders together at the Hudson Theatre in New York City for the first annual Women in the World Summit. The mission of the three-day summit was to focus on the global challenges facing women, from equal rights and education, to human slavery, literacy and the power of the media and technology to effect change in women's lives. Attendees included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Meryl Streep, Leymah Gbowee, Sunitha Krishnan, Madeleine Albright, Edna Adan Ismail, Queen Rania of Jordan, Cherie Blair and Valerie Jarrett. On 12 November 2010, The Daily Beast and Newsweek announced that they would merge their operations in a joint venture to be owned equally by Sidney Harman and IAC/InterActiveCorp. The new entity was named The Newsweek Daily Beast Company with Tina Brown as Editor-in-Chief and Stephen Colvin as CEO. On 25 July 2012, the owners of Newsweek Daily Beast said the magazine would eventually cease publishing a printed version and would transition to online-only. The reason given was that declining revenues and increasing costs made maintaining the print magazine no longer feasible. Critics quickly blamed Brown for failing to turn the magazine around. In the last week of December 2012, the final printed issue of Newsweek (under its then owners) was published with a 31 Dec date. A cover headline reflected its plans for an all-digital future, in the form of a Twitter hashtag: \\"#LastPrintIssue.\\" An editorial column by Brown and several articles in the issue reflected on the magazine's history of reportage, with a special emphasis on the two years between Harman's takeover and the end of the print magazine, which featured extensive coverage of a number of major world events, including the Arab Spring, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the US presidential election of 2012. This dramatic abandonment of print was a sign of the times, and short lived: the print edition returned with the sale of the magazine after Tina Brown's departure. On 11 September 2013, Editor-in-Chief Tina Brown announced her departure. Initial reports of her contract not being renewed were refuted in a statement issued by Barry Diller, IAC/InterActiveCorp's Executive Director: Brown's resignation also caused much speculation in the media in regard to the future of the website. This uncertainty was promptly addressed in a memo to staffers by interim CEO Rhona Murphy, \\"The Daily Beast is not for sale and is not closing. IAC has approved in concept the operating budget for 2014.\\" In the words of executive editor John Avlon, \\"The Daily Beast roars on.\\" Bibliography =Books=  * References Sources * External links * Official Random House biography Tina Brown on Charlie Rose * Category:1953 births Category:Alumni of St Anne's College, Oxford Category:Living people Category:English journalists Category:English magazine editors Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:People from Maidenhead Category:People from East Hampton (town), New York Category:The New Yorker editors Category:The New York Sun people Category:Talk (magazine) people Category:Vanity Fair (magazine) people Category:The Washington Post people Category:English women journalists Category:English people of Iraqi descent Category:Women magazine editors ","title":"Tina Brown"},{"id":"890667","text":"Talmadge \\"Tab\\" Smith (January 11, 1909 - August 17, 1971), was an American swing and rhythm and blues alto saxophonist. He is best known for the tracks, \\"Because of You\\" and \\"Pretend\\". He variously worked with Count Basie, the Mills Rhythm Boys and Lucky Millinder. Biography Smith was born in Kinston, North Carolina, United States. He joined his first professional band, the Carolina Stompers, in 1929. In the 1930s and 1940s he spent several years in the bands of Lucky Millinder and Count Basie, as well as spending long periods freelancing both as a player and as an arranger. In 1944 he participated in a recording date led by Coleman Hawkins, for which he also arranged the material. After the Second World War he led his own groups, which concentrated on rhythm and blues as jazz turned from swing to bop. His biggest R&B; hit was \\"Because of You\\", which reached number 1 on the US Billboard R&B; chart, and number 20 on the pop chart, in 1951. \\"Because of You\\" was made for United Records, a label for which Smith recorded prolifically until it closed in 1957. Tab Smith put out 24 singles and a 10-inch album for the label. On his United sides, Smith sometimes played tenor saxophone. During the 1950s, Smith was a significant rival to alto saxophone-playing bandleader Earl Bostic, who recorded for King. He was also in competition with his own formative influence, Johnny Hodges, until Hodges returned to the Duke Ellington band. His career never recovered from the closure of United Records. After brief stays at Checker and King, Smith retired from the music business in the early 1960s. He sold real estate and played piano part-time in a steakhouse. He died in St. Louis, Missouri, in August 1971, aged 62. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Tab Smith among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Mary Baldwin University (MBU, formerly Mary Baldwin College) is a private university in Staunton, Virginia. It was founded in 1842 by Rufus William Bailey as Augusta Female Seminary. Today, Mary Baldwin University is home to the Mary Baldwin College for Women, a residential women's college with a focus on liberal arts and leadership, as well as co- educational residential undergraduate programs within its University College structure. MBU also offers co-educational graduate degrees as well as undergraduate degree and certificate programs for non-traditional-aged students. The university is the oldest institution of higher education for women in the nation affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), and it is home to the only all-female corps of cadets in the world. History Located in Staunton, Virginia within Augusta County, the university was founded as the Augusta Female Seminary in 1842 by Rufus William Bailey. Among the first students was Mary Julia Baldwin. In 1863, Baldwin was named principal and headed the school through the Civil War, although most schools in the area had closed due to the war and economic hardship. The school was renamed Mary Baldwin Seminary in 1895 in honor of Baldwin. In 1923, the name changed to Mary Baldwin College when the school became a four-year institution. In 1963, Mary Baldwin became racially integrated, officially ending its policy of admitting only white women. Men were admitted as day students and graduate students starting in the mid-1970s, and the school began accepting residential male students in 2017. When Staunton Military Academy (SMA) closed in 1976, its grounds and buildings were purchased by Mary Baldwin, expanding the campus from 19 acres to 58.5. In 1977, Mary Baldwin became the first college in Virginia to launch an adult degree program. Cynthia Haldenby Tyson was appointed as the eighth president in 1985. That same year, the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted (PEG) was established to allow academically gifted girls to earn bachelor's degrees. The Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership was established as the only all-female cadet corps in 1995. In 2001, the university established the Shakespeare and Performance graduate program after the American Shakespeare Center opened the Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton. After 18 years as president, Cynthia Haldenby Tyson retired and Pamela Fox, dean of Miami University's School of Fine Arts, was named the ninth president in 2003. In May 2015, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the institution to Mary Baldwin University, effective August 31, 2016, reflecting the school's range of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral programs. Academics Mary Baldwin University offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Social Work degrees in more than 30 majors. Undergraduate degrees are offered through the Mary Baldwin College for Women and two co-educational programs: University College and Online and Adult Programs. The school offers graduate degrees through the College of Education (Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Education, Master of Science in Higher Education, and Master of Science in Applied Behavior Analysis), Murphy Deming College of Health Sciences (Doctor of Occupational Therapy, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Master of Science in Physician Assistant, and RN-to-BSN), and the Shakespeare and Performance program (Master of Letters and Master of Fine Arts). Additionally, Mary Baldwin offers fast-track degrees, bachelor's-plus- master's-degree plans, professional school preparation and certificate programs. Community service and study-abroad opportunities are supplied through the Spencer Center for Civic and Global Engagement, which opened in 2007. =Institutional partnerships= The co-educational Master of Letters and Master of Fine Arts students in the Shakespeare and Performance program is partnered with the American Shakespeare Center, allowing the students to learn and perform in the Blackfriars Playhouse located a block away from campus. The Heifetz International Music Institute, founded by violinist Daniel Heifetz, was moved from its Wolfeboro, New Hampshire location to Mary Baldwin University in 2012. The institute accepts applicants annually from around the world and offers summer programs for classically trained musicians. MBU has also partnered with international organizations including the Clinton Global Initiative and Women for Women International to sponsor participants in Women for Women programs and raise awareness of human trafficking around the world. Mary Baldwin has partnerships with several women's colleges around the world including Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts in Japan, Sungshin Women's University in South Korea, and Lady Doak College in India. The Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) Founded in 1995 by request of the Commonwealth of Virginia, VWIL (pronounced \\"vee-will\\") is an all-female cadet corps and four-year program preparing participants for both military and civilian leadership through academics, fitness, military training, practical experiences and co-circular activities. Cadets also participate in co- educational ROTC training. Commandant of the corps of cadets is Brig. Gen. Teresa \\"Terry\\" A. H. Djuric (USAF, Retired). Program for the Exceptionally Gifted The Program for the Exceptionally Gifted (PEG) at Mary Baldwin University is an early entrance college program for girls ages 12 to 15 who have not yet completed, or in some cases not yet started, high school. The program was founded in 1985 with a class of 11 students and now enrolls approximately 30 new students each year. Participants (\\"PEGs\\") reside in a PEG-specific dorm building, but attend classes with traditional-age students with the exception of a mandatory, PEG specific, introductory philosophy course named \\"Knowing the Self\\" (Phil 112). PEGs typically earn a bachelor's degree in the normal four years. Campus The MBU main campus is located in Staunton, and its Murphy Deming College of Health Sciences is located on a branch campus in nearby Fishersville. The college operates regional centers throughout Virginia in Charlottesville, Emporia, Glenns, Kilmarnock, Richmond, Roanoke, South Boston, South Hill, Warsaw, Weyers Cave, and Williamsburg. The first building on Staunton campus was the Mary Baldwin University, Main Building, built in 1844. The building now houses administrative offices and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) since 1973. Traditions MBU celebrates several annual traditions with the surrounding community. Every autumn, Mary Baldwin University commemorates Apple Day, during which students and faculty glean apples at a Virginia orchard. In recent years, the collected fruit has been distributed to area food pantries. The college also has marked Founders Day each October since 1898 to honor founders Mary Julia Baldwin and Rufus William Bailey. The \\"Mary Baldwin College Fight Song\\" is sung to the tune of \\"Blue and Gold.\\" The song was used by Staunton Military Academy (SMA) until it closed in 1976. After Mary Baldwin purchased the SMA campus, the college began using the academy's athletic fields, adopted the melody of the SMA fight song in 2008, and still flies SMA flags during parades. VWIL continues to hold an annual SMA reunion weekend involving a parade, banquet, and awarding of several scholarships. Apple Day is celebrated annually at Mary Baldwin. Classes are cancelled on one day in the fall to allow time for several service projects, including an apple gleaning, and an apple-themed carnival. Athletics building and field at Mary Baldwin Athletics Mary Baldwin's teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III. The Fighting Squirrels are a member of the USA South Athletic Conference (USA South). Men's sports include baseball, basketball (2020‚Äì21), cross country, soccer, tennis, and track and field. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

In this state, the driver's conscious mind is apparently fully focused elsewhere, while seemingly still processing the information needed to drive safely. Highway hypnosis is a manifestation of the common process of automaticity. The concept was first described in a 1921 article that mentioned the phenomenon of \\"road hypnotism\\": driving in a trance-like state while gazing at a fixed point. A 1929 study, Sleeping with the Eyes Open by Walter Miles, also dealt with the subject, suggesting that it was possible for motorists to fall asleep with their eyes open and continuing to steer. The idea that the unaccountable automobile accidents could be explained by this phenomenon became popular in the 1950s. The term \\"highway hypnosis\\" was coined by G. W. Williams in 1963. Building on the theories of Ernest Hilgard (1986, 1992) that hypnosis is an altered state of awareness, some theorists hold that the consciousness can develop hypnotic dissociation. In the example of highway hypnosis, one stream of consciousness is driving the car while the other is dealing with other matters. Partial or complete amnesia related to the time spent driving under highway hypnosis can develop for the driver involved.

The series derives its name from the setting of the majority of the books, the Sector 12 General Hospital, a huge hospital space station located in deep space, designed to treat a wide variety of life forms with a wide range of ailments and life-support requirements, and to house an equally diverse staff. The Hospital was founded to promote peace after humanity's first interstellar war, and in the fourth book the authorities conclude that its emergency services are the most effective way to make peaceful contact with new species. In order to treat patients of other species, doctors must download into their brains \\"Educator tapes\\" containing the necessary medical knowledge, and these tapes also transmit the personalities of their donors. As a result, doctors have to struggle with the tastes imported from their donors, ranging from a dislike of their own species' normal food to sexual attraction for members of the donor's species. Other running gags include the acerbic tongue of the Chief Psychologist and one very senior non-human doctor's love of gossip, especially about the sexual behavior of other species. The series is noted for its diverse and believable non-humanoid alien life forms, and for its pacifist philosophy. White chose the hospital setting as a way to generate dramatic tension without violence, and because in his youth he wanted to be a doctor but had to go to work. Some commentators have praised the whole series, while others have thought there was a decline after the sixth book. One reviewer described the last book as \\"in a very positive way, a throwback to an earlier era in science fiction\\". Background Sector General is a gigantic multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from opposite sides of humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, but many of the stories feature types of patient that the builders did not anticipate. Also at Initially most of the stories center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations. White said that The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced him to write about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on epidemics and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer. Challenges of inter-species medicine Sector General was founded to promote inter-species harmony, and therefore all medical staff must be prepared to treat beings with very different physiologies and behavior patterns, and sometimes with environmental requirements that would be lethal to staff without suitable protection. The hospital uses a four-letter system to assign patients to wards that provide suitable environments, a classification technique used earlier by E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Children of the Lens. White's Star Healer introduces the classification \\"FOKT\\", which is regarded as an in-joke on the name of the Glasgow science fiction club Friends of Kilgore Trout. Early on, it was learned that diseases were species specific, so there was no danger of a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing a pandemic. Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences. When necessary physicians, surgeons and pathologists download information about patients' species into their minds from \\"Educator tapes\\", recordings of the memories of great practitioners in the appropriate species. However, in addition to medical knowledge, the educator tapes also capture the personalities of the medical experts who recorded them. Thus having an educator tape active threatens the recipient with multiple personality disorder. The new personality is from a vastly different species, often with very different behavior codes and sexual preferences, and, to make matters worse, the donors were often very dominant personalities. The mildest symptom of such conflicts is a running gag in which users of these tapes are often seen in the Sector General's cafeteria, eating a bland-looking sandwich with closed eyes. On the other hand, the risk of finding members of other species sexually attractive is a serious concern. Junior doctors usually have these acquired memories erased as soon as possible. However, as a doctor rises up through the hospital hierarchy, and if its mind proves to be sufficiently stable, it may find itself the permanent recipient of one or more tapes. Diagnosticians, the medical elite of Sector General, can have as many as ten different tapes active at one time, as they may have to supervise treatment of many species at the same time. In the case of species with two permanent sexes, including but not limited to Earth- humans, the stories state that females are psychologically incapable of allowing their psyches to be violated to the extent required by the educator tapes. However, in one of the later books a very assertive non-human female character accidentally acquires several sets of memories which cannot be erased, and adjusts to this with relative ease. Regular characters Although many of the characters are \\"Earth-human\\" ‚Äì \\"human\\" is ambiguous because all species refers to themselves as \\"human\\" in their own languages ‚Äì the stories feature medical staff from a wide range of species. In each story characters belonging to species different from that of the protagonist are treated as neuter and referred to as \\"it\\". Some species are touchy about any reference to sexual roles and behavior, some have more than two sexes and some change sex once or more during their lifetimes. The following appear in nearly all the stories: ;Dr. Conway :A male Earth-human who starts as a junior intern and, over the course of the series, works his way up to Chief Surgeon and eventually Diagnostician in Charge of Surgery. Conway (whose first name, Peter, is only revealed in the ninth book) generally prefers extraterrestrial company to that of his own species, and has a habit of thinking aloud. His passions are healing and Murchison. ;Murchison :A curvaceous female Earth- human first seen as a senior nurse in the Pathology department. She eventually becomes a doctor and a Pathologist herself, and also Conway's wife. ;Dr. Prilicla :A large but fragile winged insect-like being from the very low- gravity planet Cinruss. In addition to being highly skilled in the more delicate types of surgery, Prilicla is an empath and therefore can sense the emotions of most other lifeforms including many non-intelligent animals. Its tact and the desire of colleagues to avoid distressing it by displaying negative emotions generally makes others willing to follow its advice ‚Äì a pattern that one reviewer described as \\"a pleasant Machiavellian streak.\\" Despite its natural timidity and the distress that other beings' anger, fear and pain cause it, Prilicla uses its empathic ability in prolonged searches for survivors of space combat and accidents. ;Major O'Mara :The Earth-human head of the hospital's Psychology department, his job is to ensure that the hospital's diverse species work together as harmoniously, efficiently and safely as circumstances allow, and particularly to save the staff from being driven insane by over-use of Educator tapes. Since he is a very acute observer of behavior and often uses sarcasm \\"to shrink heads, not swell them\\", he is sometimes called a \\"latter-day Torquemada\\". ;Charge Nurse Naydrad :A member of the Kelgian species, Naydrad looks like a giant caterpillar. Since the involuntary movements of Kelgians' fur completely show their emotions, the species is incapable of both lying and tact. Naydrad is a specialist in rescuing victims of space accidents. ;Thornnastor :A native of the high- gravity planet Traltha, Thornnastor (nicknamed \\"Thorny\\") has a body like a six-legged elephant, and its own keen senses are supplemented by a symbiont that provides acute vision over up to 360 degrees. Thornnastor is the Diagnostician in Charge of Pathology, and it carries ten Educator tapes. Its fascination with gossip, especially about the scandalous activities of a multi-sexed, methane-breathing, cryogenic species, is a running gag in the series. Critical appraisal The Sector General series defined the subgenre of multi-species medical stories, although L. Ron Hubbard's Ole Doc Methuselah stories and Murray Leinster's Med Service stories, neither of which were highly regarded, had explored some similar themes. Sector General was \\"the first explicitly pacifist space opera\\" series, while much of contemporary space opera from the USA was notably military. Mike Resnick described the series' characters as \\"the most memorable crew of aliens ever created\\". Michael Ashley commented that the setting of the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is reminiscent of Sector General. The Babylon 5 television series was also set in space station with atmospheres for different species. It is highly likely that the short lived 1998-99 television series Mercy Point was influenced by Sector General. Many commentators attribute the series' popularity to the altruism of its doctors and the emphasis on seeking to build peaceful relations between different species. John Clute wrote that \\"in the depiction of goodness may lie the real genius of James White.\\" White's hatred of war and xenophobia is a constant theme of the series, notably in: Star Surgeon, where the Monitor Corps fights a savage battle in defence of the hospital space station, to prevent the conflict from escalating into a full interstellar war that can only end in genocide; and in The Genocidal Healer, where an alien race's sexual urges are almost eliminated by a plague and can only be stimulated by hand-to-hand combat. The early stories focus almost entirely on medical problems, mainly from Conway's viewpoint. In Dave Langford's opinion the xenobiological novelties were becoming less credible by the end of Star Healer, and using a variety of alien viewpoint characters gave the later books \\"considerable new pep\\". These also deal with deeper issues, notably in The Genocidal Healer, and better than most science fiction according to Resnick. Opinions differ about the quality of the series as a whole. For example, Gary Westfahl wrote that \\"the Sector General stories remained consistently fresh and involving, and they grew in prominence as the series progressed.\\" On the other hand, Todd White wrote that the series declined after Star Healer (1985), hitting a low point with The Galactic Gourmet (1996), and that the later books tended to stretch a short story's worth of content to the length of a novel. However he thought that Mind Changer (1998) represented an improvement. Publishers Weekly described Mind Changer as \\"White's finest performance, replete with wit, originality, medical expertise and sheer decency\\" and commented that the series shows no signs of aging, Summarized at and Booklist described the book as an \\"enjoyable, witty resum√©\\" of Chief Psychologist O'Mara's career. Summarized at Clinton Lawrence described the last Sector General book, Double Contact (1999), as \\"in a very positive way, a throwback to an earlier era in science fiction\\" since it is optimistic and depicts several advanced species working harmoniously. The struggle to build trust and produce a successful first contact is, he thought, as exciting and suspenseful as one could wish for. However he noted that the level of characterization was the minimum required to support the plot. Stories in the series The Sector General series began as short stories published in New Worlds from 1957 onwards. Originally White intended to end the series with Star Healer (1985), by which time the central characters had reached the top levels in their careers, but Ballantine Books persuaded him to continue. He extended the stories' range by introducing new central characters beginning with Code Blue - Emergency (1987), and The Genocidal Healer (1992) focused on psychological and theological issues of guilt and forgiveness rather than strictly medical ones. The books in the series are: * Hospital Station (1962: stories published in New Worlds 1957‚Äì1960) * Star Surgeon (1963) * Major Operation (1971: stories published in New Worlds 1968‚Äì1971) * Ambulance Ship (1979) * Sector General (1983) * Star Healer (1985) * Code Blue - Emergency (1987) * The Genocidal Healer (1992) * The Galactic Gourmet (1996) * Final Diagnosis (1997) * Mind Changer (1998) * Double Contact (1999) These were also published as omnibus editions: * Beginning Operations (2001) contains Hospital Station, Star Surgeon and Major Operation. * Alien Emergencies (2002) contains Ambulance Ship, Sector General and Star Healer. * General Practice (2003) contains Code Blue - Emergency and The Genocidal Healer. * Tales of Sector General (1999) contains The Galactic Gourmet, Final Diagnosis, and Mind Changer. =Short stories= *White's short story \\"Sector General\\" is included in the book Hospital Station. *In addition to these books, several related short stories (\\"Countercharm\\", \\"Tableau\\", \\"Occupation: Warrior\\", and \\"Custom Fitting\\") appear in other collections by White. The first three appear in The Aliens Among Us, the fourth in Futures Past. *The short story \\"Custom Fitting\\" does not mention Sector General, but does describe the Galactic Federation making its first contact with Earth. \\"Tableau\\" also does not mention Sector General but introduces the alien race of the Orligians, who appear in the series. *The short story \\"Occupation: Warrior\\", published in 1959, provides the backstory of the Monitor Corps' Commander Dermod, who appears in some of the books.

He earned the nickname \\"Sure Shot\\" for the strength and accuracy of his throws to first base, and was also sometimes referred to in the 1880s as the \\"King of Second Basemen.\\" Dunlap played for the Cleveland Blues from 1880 to 1883, where he secured his reputation as one of the best players in the game. As a rookie in 1880, he led the National League in doubles and ranked second in extra base hits. While playing for Cleveland, he also compiled batting averages of .325 and .326 in 1881 and 1883 and led the league in assists by a second baseman and range factor. When the Union Association was formed in 1884, Dunlap was lured to play for the St. Louis Maroons where he became the highest paid player in baseball. His .412 batting average in 1884 was the highest ever recorded to that time in Major League Baseball and 56 points higher than any other player in the major leagues in 1884 due to the lack of talent in the UA. After three years in St. Louis, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines and helped that team win the 1887 National League pennant. Dunlap's baseball career ended in 1891 when he broke his leg sliding into a base. He went into the construction business and bet on the horses in the 1890s. At the time of his death in 1902, Dunlap was penniless and living in a rundown boarding house. Early years Dunlap was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1859. Both of his parents died when he was 10 years old. Dunlap did not attend school after his parents died and spent his youth playing baseball. Lacking formal education, Dunlap remained illiterate throughout his life. Dunlap began playing semi-pro baseball at age 15 in 1874 for the Gloucester Club in Gloucester City, New Jersey. In 1875, he started the season with the Greighers of Camden, New Jersey, then joined the Kleinz Club of Philadelphia. He played for Chester at the start of the 1876 season before joining the Quicksteps of Wilmington, Delaware, as a pitcher. In 1877, he began playing professional baseball as a second baseman for the Auburns of Auburn, New York. In 1878, he played for teams in Hornellsville and Albany, New York. He remained with Albany in 1879. Major League Baseball =Cleveland Blues= In May 1880, Dunlap began a 12-year career in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Blues. In his first season, Dunlap immediately established himself as one of the game's best players. For the 1880 season, Dunlap led the National League (NL) in doubles (27) and ranked second in extra base hits (40) and times on base (132) while serving as the team's leadoff hitter. He also made a strong debut on defense, leading the National League in assists by a second baseman (290). Dunlap remained with the Blues for four seasons and consistently ranked as one of the leading hitters and defensive second basemen in the National League. In 1881, he compiled 156 total bases, the second most in the NL, and had a .325 batting average and .444 slugging percentage, ranking fifth in the NL in both categories. In 1882, he led the NL's second basemen with 297 assists and a range factor of 6.73. In his final year in Cleveland, Dunlap had a .326 batting average, .361 on-base percentage, and .452 slugging percentage, ranking among the league's leaders in each of those categories. Defensively, he led the league's second basemen in putouts (304) and ranked third in assists (290) and fielding percentage (.911). Dunlap was the star of the Cleveland team in the early 1880s. So key was he to the Blues that one writer observed, \\"The Maroons without Dunlap are like the play of Hamlet without the melancholy Dane.\\" =\\"Sure Shot\\"= Dunlap was known during his baseball career by the nicknames \\"Sure Shot\\" and \\"King of Second Basemen\\".(accessible through newspapers.com) Most accounts indicate that the \\"Sure Shot\\" nickname arose from Dunlap's powerful and accurate throws to first base. King Kelly reportedly gave Dunlap the \\"Sure Shot\\" nickname after watching him throw. One account described Dunlap's throwing prowess as follows: \\"[E]ndless practice made him adept as a monkey at grabbing a sizzling ground ball in either hand and firing it off from the very spot he seized it. His whistling throws, which seemed to clear the grass by no more than half a foot, never seemed to lose more than an inch or two.\\" Alfred Henry Spink, who saw Dunlap play, wrote that Dunlap could chase down a ball in the outfield and throw it to home plate \\"with such fearful speed and accuracy that the ball seemed to sing as it flew.\\" Dunlap was known for his range in getting to balls that others of his era could not, and he was reportedly able to dive for a ball and throw while lying on the ground with enough velocity to sting the first baseman's hand. Dunlap was ambidextrous and was able to catch and throw a baseball with the same skill and accuracy with either hand. Moreover, Dunlap reportedly never wore a glove. One source gives an entirely different account of how Dunlap obtained the \\"Sure Shot\\" nickname. In his book on the history of the home run, Mark Ribowsky wrote that the nickname dated back to a game against the Chicago White Stockings on July 10, 1880. The White Stockings had won 21 straight games until Dunlap hit a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. According to Ribowsky, \\"For this Shot Heard 'Round Cleveland, Dunlap won the nickname 'Sure Shot.'\\" =St. Louis Maroons= In November 1883, Dunlap signed a contract to play for the St. Louis Maroons in the new Union Association. He was the biggest star lured to the new league. His contract paid Dunlap a salary of $3,400 (including $1,000 paid in advance), the highest salary paid to any baseball player at that time. He remained the highest paid baseball player every year from 1884 to 1889. Dunlap played second base for the St. Louis Maroons from 1884 to 1886 and also served as the team's manager for portions of those seasons. During the 1884 season, the Maroons and Dunlap dominated the Union Association. The team compiled a record of 94-19, and Dunlap led the new league in most significant offensive and defensive categories. His .412 batting average was 56 points higher than any other player in the Union Association, the National League, or the American Association. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.448), slugging percentage (.621), runs scored (160), hits (185), total bases (279), home runs (13), extra base hits (60), assists by a second baseman (300), putouts by a second baseman (341), range factor at second base (6.41), and fielding percentage at second base (.926). Dunlap's .412 batting average in 1884 was the highest ever recorded in any of the major leagues up to that time. His 160 runs scored in 1884 remains one of the highest single-season totals in major league history. Some baseball historians have suggested that Dunlap's accomplishments during the 1884 season should be discounted due to the lesser talent pool in the Union Association. In 1885, the Union Association was disbanded after only one year, and the St. Louis Maroons joined the National League. Although his batting average dropped 142 points to .270 in 1885, Dunlap continued to be one of the best defensive second basemen in the major leagues. He led the National League's second basemen in 1885 with a .934 fielding percentage and ranked second in assists (374), putouts (314), and range factor (6.49). Dunlap spent a third season with the Maroons in 1886, and hit for the cycle on May 24. However, the Maroons were in financial distress, and rumors spread that the team might disband. =Detroit Wolverines= 1888 baseball card of Dunlap In early August 1886, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most expensive purchase price at the time. In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 on the first day of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: \\"The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons.\\" The Detroit management was praised for their \\"pluck and enterprise\\" in making the bold \\"business stroke.\\" The Sporting News wrote at the time: > \\"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League > pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. From the day the old > St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a > favorite in St. Louis. Still there was no one in the world but was willing > to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known.\\" Dunlap, too, expressed delight at the move, noting that he had \\"tried for two seasons to get away from the Maroons.\\" While the reaction to the acquisition was overwhelmingly positive in Detroit, the Detroit Free Press expressed some concern over Dunlap's reputation as a \\"disorganizer\\" and \\"mischief maker.\\" For the 1886 season, Dunlap led the National League with a career high 393 assists, more than any NL player at any position. In 1887, Dunlap's defensive play at second base helped lead the Detroit Wolverines to the NL pennant with a record of 79-45. Dunlap again led the NL's second basemen in fielding percentage (.948) while also ranking second in range factor (6.72). He also played in 11 games of the 1887 World Series against the American Association champions, the St. Louis Browns. Detroit won the series 10 games to 5. At the end of the 1887 season, Sporting Life praised Dunlap's contributions to Detroit's championship team: \\"Dunlap is the king of second basemen, and a first-class all-round player. His fielding average in 1886 was .931, ranking third. This season he ranks first, with .949. ... Dunlap is one of the most active men on the field, and is of great value to a team on account of his ability as a kicker and coacher.\\" Before the last game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a commensurate payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 that he would not consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said at the time, \\"I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers.\\" He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- \\"give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with me last year.\\" In January 1888, Dunlap finally consented to the sale and received $2,000 of the $5,000 sales price paid to Detroit. His total annual compensation on signing with Pittsburgh was $6,000, making him the highest paid player in baseball history to that time. The Detroit Free Press congratulated the \\"cranks\\" of Pittsburgh for their team's acquisition of \\"no less than the king second baseman of the country.\\" =Pittsburgh Alleghenys= Dunlap played for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys from 1888 to 1890, and served as manager of the Alleghenys for a portion of the 1889 season. During his three years in Pittsburgh, Dunlap's offensive performance declined. His batting average for the Alleghenys went from .262 in 1888 to .235 in 1889. At the same time, he remained one of the leading defensive second basemen in the game. In 1888, Dunlap ranked second among the league's second basemen in fielding percentage (.940) and range factor (6.33), and in 1889, Dunlap's last full season in the major leagues, his .950 fielding percentage led the National League and was a career high for Dunlap. Before the start of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in protracted salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenys. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, \\"and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club.\\" Nimick said at the time: \\"I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us.\\" In the first 17 games of the 1890 season, Dunlap's batting average fell to .172, and as a result he was released by the Alleghenys on May 15. Aside from his batting average, disagreements with Pittsburgh's manager, Guy Hecker, reportedly contributed to the decision. The Pittsburgh Dispatch quoted manager Hecker as saying, \\"Dunlap is certainly the worst man to get along with that I ever met. He has had everybody in hot water during our entire western trip.\\" Others speculated that Dunlap's release was motivated by his $3,500 salary and the fact that Pittsburgh's backup second baseman, Henry Youngman, had signed for a salary of only $1,050. =Giants and Statesmen= Dunlap jumped to the New York Giants of the Players' League in late May 1890. At the time, the Washington correspondent for Sporting Life predicted that Dunlap would bring bad luck to his new team. He wrote: \\"Fred is a great player, but the hoo-doo that seems to shadow him will make itself felt wherever he may go. There are a number of people in this vicinity who have watched his course with more than ordinary interest, and they do not hesitate to declare him a Jonah.\\" Dunlap appeared in only one game for the Giants and announced in July that he would play no more in 1890 and that he would spend the remainder of the summer at Atlantic City, New Jersey, with plans to return in 1891 \\"and play the game of his life.\\" Dunlap concluded his baseball career in 1891 with the Washington Statesmen in the American Association. He appeared in only eight games for the Statesmen before breaking his leg sliding into a base on April 20, 1891. In early June 1891, the Washington management notified him that it would discontinue his salary payments. Dunlap returned the notice and filed a grievance, contending he should have been continued at least on half pay since he was disabled while sliding into a base. Washington refused to pay, and he never played professional baseball again. =Career Statistics= In 965 games over 12 seasons, Dunlap posted a .292 batting average (1159-for-3974) with 759 runs, 224 doubles, 53 triples, 41 home runs, 366 RBI, 85 stolen bases, 283 bases on balls, .340 on-base percentage and .406 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .924 fielding percentage. Later life When he retired from baseball, Dunlap was reported to have $100,000 in savings. He went into the building business in Philadelphia during the 1890s, and owned various properties in the city. The Sporting Life reported that Dunlap \\"dropped out of the game in 1892 to follow the racing game, at which he lost the respectable fortune he accumulated in base ball.\\" Another account indicated that Dunlap lost everything on stock market investments. In July 1902, the Philadelphia Times reported that Dunlap was \\"clean broke.\\" In December 1902, Dunlap died penniless and alone at age 43. According to the Sporting Life, the \\"last two years of his life were spent in abject poverty and mental gloom\\" in a Philadelphia boarding house. According to several accounts, a policeman at the morgue saw the body and believed it to be Dunlap. Lave Cross was called to the morgue and confirmed that the body was Dunlap.(\\"Fred Dunlap, at one time the best second baseman in the country, and a bright star in Detroit's famous big team, was buried here to-day. Although he drew as high as $5,000 per season, he died penniless.\\") His funeral was poorly attended by his former baseball colleagues, and one former player who did attend observed, \\"There were not enough friends of Dunlap at his funeral to bury him and we had to call on the hack drivers to make up the list of active pall-bearers.\\" Following Dunlap's death, William A. Phelon, Jr., editor of Sporting Life wrote: > \\"So Fred Dunlap has passed into the great beyond, and the man whose salary > figure marked the high-water limit of the long ago is gone! ... What a ball > player this Dunlap was and what an artist in getting the fat salaries! ... > Dunlap was a real infielder of the type so popular ten years ago -- one of > the solid, bulky style through whom no grounder seemed able to pass, but who > could nevertheless wave the hot ones goodbye with graceful ease when > occasion demanded. With the gloves now in use to aid, Dunny would have been > even a bigger wonder now than then.\\" Legacy Dunlap has been rated by some contemporary and modern sources as the greatest overall second baseman of the 19th century. In his 1910 book on the history of baseball, Alfred Henry Spink, the founder of The Sporting News, was unequivocal: \\"I have seen all the great second basemen ... I am free to say that Dunlap was far and away the greatest second baseman that ever lived.\\" Stanley Robinson, who owned and managed major league teams in St. Louis and Cleveland, went even further: \\"He was not only the greatest second baseman, but take him in all the departments of the game, he was perhaps the greatest player that ever lived.\\" Another of Dunlap's contemporaries, Sam Crane, also picked Dunlap as the greatest second baseman in a newspaper column published in 1912. Crane wrote: \\"Fred Dunlap was acknowledged to be the best second baseman of his day, and was excellent from every angle. I think he excelled Fred Pfeffer.\\" In 1910, John Montgomery Ward, a Hall of Fame inductee who played from 1878 to 1894, published an article about the greatest infielders in baseball history. While picking Fred Pfeffer as a shade better than Dunlap\\", Ward observed: \\"Fred Dunlap was the king. Dunlap had the record average of .953 in 64 games with the Detroit club in 1887, and was the personification of ease and grace. He was something of a grandstand player, because of his tendency to make one-handed catches and stops but he got there just the same and was a big favorite wherever he showed.\\" In a 2008 book using modern sabermetric methods, author William F. McNeil concluded that Dunlap was the best offensive second baseman, the second best defensive second baseman, and the best overall second baseman of the 19th century. Dunlap's career range factor of 6.31 at second base still ranks as the fifth highest in the history of Major League Baseball. However, Bill James, in his 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, ranked Dunlap as the 89th greatest second baseman of all time (and the 8th best of those who played the majority of their careers in the 19th century). James wrote that Dunlap was \\"never a legitimate star in a legitimate major league, but a good second baseman and a .275 hitter.\\" See also * List of Major League Baseball annual doubles leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle * List of Major League Baseball player-managers References External links , or Retrosheet * : Category:1859 births Category:1902 deaths Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Major League Baseball player-managers Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Cleveland Blues (NL) players Category:Detroit Wolverines players Category:New York Giants (PL) players Category:Pittsburgh Alleghenys players Category:St. Louis Maroons players Category:Washington Statesmen players Category:Cleveland Blues (NL) managers Category:St. Louis Maroons managers Category:Pittsburgh Alleghenys managers Category:Auburn (minor league baseball) players Category:Hornellsville Hornells players Category:Albany (minor league baseball) players Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia ","title":"Fred Dunlap"},{"id":"890684","text":"Caller may refer to: * Caller (telecommunications), a party that originates a call * Caller (dancing), a person that calls dance figures in round dances and square dances * Caller, the Catalan equivalent of Cagliari * A software program or procedure that invokes a subroutine See also *The Caller (disambiguation) *Call (disambiguation) *Calling (disambiguation) ","title":"Caller"},{"id":"890689","text":"Newstead Wood School is a state selective girls' grammar school in Avebury Road, Orpington, London, England. Admissions The school specialises in engineering and psychology. The current head teacher is Alan Blount. The school's motto is Fortitudine Crescamus (Latin for: 'May we grow in strength'). The school has recently begun admitting boys into the sixth form. It is in the Crofton area of Orpington, not far from the A21 and next to Darrick Wood. Darrick Wood School and the Princess Royal University Hospital are the other side of Darrick Wood, to the west. The London Outer Orbital Path passes adjacent to the playing fields. It lies in the parish of St Paul's, Crofton. History It was founded as the Orpington Grammar School for Girls in 1957,National Archives when administered by the Kent Education Committee. It became part of Bromley in 1965. There were firm plans for the school to become comprehensive in 1978. Nearby Bullers Wood School went comprehensive in the late 1970s. In 1997, a survey in the Sunday Times found that the school was the best value in England for each A or B grade achieved at A-level, second to St Olave's school; Bromley was a low spender (per pupil) comparative to other LEAs. In 2004, a pupil gained the best result at Maths GCSE in England. In 2009 the headteacher told the conference in Harrogate of the Girls' Schools Associationhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/6590063/Schools-reluctant-to- push-brightest-pupils.html The Daily Telegraph November 2009 that schools were not concentrating on brighter pupils, instead trying to raise average pupils' grades from D to C, and that girls in mixed-sex schools can have their ambitions crushed and be held back in male-dominated professions (girls from single-sex schools are statistically more successful in science-based professions than from mixed schools). She also criticised a government scheme to give one-to-one tuition to less able pupils, and not more-able students, when considering the lack of women in traditionally-male occupations, and she claimed there was a 'huge reluctance' to concentrate on top students. On 1 April 2011, the school gained academy status and is now sponsored by United Learning. =Headteachers= * Alan Blount 2018-present * Nicholas Webb 2015‚Äì2018 * Elizabeth Allen CBE (technically Mrs E Bennett) 2001‚Äì2013 (Headteacher from 1993 to 2001 of Altwood Church of England School, and a former Religious Studies teacher) * Barbara Gibbs FRSA 1994‚Äì2001 (later Headteacher from 2001 to 2006 of the British School in the Netherlands, and a former Chemistry teacher) * Valerie Smith 1980‚Äì1994 * Hilda M.

Academic performance In 2003 Newstead Wood was described by Ofsted as \\"an outstandingly successful school\\". The school has a large catchment area, from which pupils are selected on the basis of tests in verbal and non-verbal reasoning. Around 900 girls sit the entrance tests annually and competition is intense. In 2004 there were eight applicants per place. Amongst leavers in 2005, 25 students gained places at Oxford and Cambridge universities.

The first letters of each house came from the initials of Newstead Wood School, and the name of the house was both a bird, and a notable historical figure (Florence Nightingale, Christopher Wren and Jonathan Swift). Each year group had three classes, one from each house. As the school expanded, each year group grew to 4 classes, and a fourth house, Griffin, was founded. The school continued to expand, growing to 5 classes in each year, and so the Falcon house was founded. It expanded still, having six classes since the September 2013 intake. The school now consists of six houses: Nightingale, Wren, Swift, Falcon, Griffin and Phoenix. The first five house names come from the school's initials NWSFG (Newstead Wood School For Girls), the sixth house, Phoenix was added in 2017 and celebrates the school reaching six forms for all years in the school. The September 2017 intake was the first year group to include Phoenix.

A chicken can be hypnotized, or put into a trance, with its head down near the ground, by drawing a line along the ground with a stick or a finger, starting at the beak and extending straight outward in front of the chicken. If the chicken is hypnotized in this manner, it will continue to stare at the line, remaining immobile for as long as 30 minutes. Other methods of inducing this state are also known. Ethologists refer to this state as 'tonic immobility' i.e. a natural state of semi-paralysis that some animals enter when presented with a threat,Gallup, G.G., Jr., Nash, R.F., Potter, R.J. and Donegan, N.H., (1970).

Applied Animal Ethology 7: 369-372 which is probably a defensive mechanism intended to feign death, albeit rather poorly. The first known written reference for this method came in 1646, in Mirabele Experimentum de Imaginatione Gallinae by Athanasius Kircher in Rome. Methods One technique of hypnosis is to hold the chicken face up with its back on the ground, and then run a finger downwards from the chicken's wattles to just above its vent. The chicken's feet are exposed, which allows easy application of medication for foot mites, etc. Clapping hands or giving the chicken a gentle shove will waken it. One can also hypnotize a chicken by mimicking how it sleeps ‚Äì with its head under its wing. In this method, hold the bird firmly, placing its head under its wing, then, gently rock the chicken back and forth and set it very carefully on the ground. It should stay in the same position for about 30 seconds. H.B. Gibson, in his book Hypnosis ‚Äì its Nature and Therapeutic Uses, states that the record period for a chicken remaining under hypnosis is 3 hours, 47 minutes. Notable people who have discussed chicken hypnotism * Helmut Kohl, German statesman. Kohl's preferred method seems to be similar to that used by Werner Herzog, he used \\"a line drawn by chalk\\".Stern magazine, 13 September 1996 * Al Gore, former U.S. vice-president, Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-presidential candidate. Gore's technique consisted of drawing circles around the chicken's head. * Werner Herzog. \\"known to hypnotize chickens; he also hypnotized the cast of his 1976 film Heart of Glass\\" * Steve Fairnie, 1980s British musician: \\"You have to dominate the chicken and be right above it staring into its eyes. Then it will either go under or it will attack you, so you have to be a bit careful...\\" * Adam Savage, in the Mythbusters Revealed special, is briefly seen hypnotising a chicken. In popular culture * Friedrich Nietzsche, 19th-century German philosopher, in his book Thus Spoke Zarathustra used a philosophical metaphor referring to the hypnosis of the chicken. It is in Chapter 6, \\"The Pale Criminal\\", and reads as follows: \\"The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched his weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.\\" Nietzsche employs this metaphor again within the third essay of On the Genealogy of Morality, stating, \\"The unhappy man has heard, has understood; he is like a hen around which a line has been drawn. He cannot get out of this drawn circle.\\" *Clark Gable, in the 1945 film Adventure hypnotizes a rooster while he and Greer Garson try to lure chickens from behind the bush by using the rooster as bait. * Werner Herzog has included chicken hypnotism in several films, including the 1968 Signs of Life, which features a scene in which a chicken is hypnotized by a line drawn by chalk, and his 1974 film, The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. * Federico Fellini's 1984 And the Ship Sails On features a scene in which a male opera singer hypnotises a chicken in the mess hall. *Ernest Hemingway briefly describes the process in The Dangerous Summer, comparing it to the hypnotic effect of a bullfighters' cape. * The 1993 film Even Cowgirls Get the Blues has some lines about chicken hypnotism and shows a character hypnotizing chickens by twirling them in the air exactly twenty times. * The United States military when trying to avoid divulging information gives reporters briefings with 25 minutes of intentionally dull PowerPoint presentations and 5 minutes left at the end for questions from anyone who is still awake. The presentations are called hypnotizing chickens. * Thomas B. Hess, art critic and long time editor of ARTnews, used chicken hypnotism to describe Barnett Newman's iconic \\"zip\\" paintings in a 1950 review: \\"There were some terrific optical illusions: if you stared closely at the big red painting with the thin white stripe, its bottom seemed to shoot out at your ankles, and the rectangular canvas itself appeared wildly distorted. It is quite like what happens to a hen when its beak is put on the ground and a chalk line drawn away from it on the floor. However, very few spectators actually became hypnotized\\" (ARTnews, March 1950). *The Iggy Pop song \\"Lust for Life\\" contains a line referring to \\"hypnotizing chickens\\", in a nod to William Burroughs' novel The Ticket That Exploded. *In an episode of King of the Road, Toy Machine had to hypnotise a chicken as part of a special challenge whilst visiting legendary skater Jason Jessee. Jason first demonstrated his method by holding the chicken with his right hand by the feet and drawing tight circles with his left hand above the chickens left eye. This was repeated by professional skateboarder Daniel Lutheran to earn Toy Machine 100 points.

It is managed as an independent institute associated with Stockholm University through its Department of Astronomy. It is also a national research infrastructure under the Swedish Research Council. The institute was first established in 1951 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences as The Research Station for Astrophysics on the island of Capri, Italy. Around 1980 the station moved to La Palma in the Canary Islands. The new station is situated within the Spanish-International Observatory on the Roque de los Muchachos. It soon became obvious that the superior astronomical climate on La Palma called for a first-class solar telescope. The 47.5-cm Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope, SVST, was erected in 1985. During the nineties, the daily operations of the institute gradually moved from La Palma to Stockholm. The SVST was removed from the tower on 28 August 2000 after almost 15 years of successful operations. The SVST has been replaced with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, which has twice as large aperture diameter. In 2013, the institute was transferred from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to its current home with Stockholm University.

The caller might be one of the participating dancers, though in modern country dance this is rare. In round dance a person who performs this function is called a cuer. Their role is fundamentally the same as a caller, in that they tell dancers what to do in a given dance, though they differ on several smaller points. In northern New England contra dancing, the caller is also known as the prompter.  Comparing callers and cuers  Callers and cuers serve slightly different functions in different types of dance. Improvisation in modern Western square dance calling distinguishes it from the calling in many other types of dance. Callers in many dance types are expected to sing and to be entertaining, but round dance cuers do not sing and are expected to be as unobtrusive as possible. Standardized dances such as round dance, modern western square dance, and Salsa Rueda consist of a number of defined difficulty levels. Callers and cuers are responsible for knowing all of the calls or cues (respectively), also known as figures, for the defined difficulty level at which their dancers are dancing, as well as all figures belonging to lower or easier levels. Callers for other types of dance may be required only to know the particular dance they are calling. The contra dance caller Contra dance callers typically take on a role as the host of a contra dance event, stepping aside only briefly to let the organizers of the dance (who hired them and arranged logistics) make announcements (typically before the break). They are responsible for helping attendees find partners and organize themselves into contra lines, for teaching them the moves of the dance during a walkthrough, and for calling the moves during the dance until the dancers have it memorized. They also coordinate with the band to help them figure out which tunes to play and how long to play a dance for.  The modern Western square dance caller  The role of a caller in modern western square dance is not only to provide the dance steps which all of the dancers on the floor should be able to follow, but also to provide entertainment through a combination of factors, including programming, showmanship, singing ability, and challenging choreography. Part of the entertainment factor can come from the caller's use of \\"patter\\" ‚Äî a set of rhyming words and rhythms that complement the names of the dance steps being called. Patter can not only be entertaining because it is innovative and surprising, but it can also fill in the space between lengthy dance patterns, helping boost up the energy during potentially dull moments. There is a large, common pool of patter which callers might use. Examples are: > _Allemande left_ with your left hand. / Back to the partner for a _right and > left grand_. > OR > > Ace of diamonds, Jack of spades / Meet your partner and all _promenade_. The square dance calls are underlined; all the rest is patter. Many callers spend time inventing their own unique patter or variants on common patter. Entertainment also comes from callers challenging the dancers on the floor. There are many techniques to accomplish this. This can be done choreographically, for example, by mixing dance calls in unexpected or unusual ways, by varying expected dance patterns, or by calling figures from unusual and unexpected formations. Callers might also use gimmicks such as calling a common and well-known sequence of calls, and then catching dancers off guard by suddenly changing an expected call. Occasionally callers make mistakes, or forget what they are doing momentarily, in which case, it is important for them to be able to keep the dancers moving and to bring the dancers back to their partners, and home again, smoothly, and hopefully without anybody noticing. = Call types = There are two primary classifications of figure types in modern Western square dancing, patter and singing.  Patter calls  Patter calls, also known as hash calls, are based on a quick and fluid succession of spoken (\\"pattered\\") or sing-song delivered calls, often to the accompaniment of an instrumental piece of music that it is not necessarily recognizable as a song. Choreography may appear \\"on-the-fly\\" with calls randomly strung together, but it conforms to strict choreographic rules. Most patter calling is improvised by the caller as the dancers are moving; if the tempo of the calling is done at a fast pace allowing the dancers to flow from one move to another without pauses, it may be called hot hash. The primary purpose of patter calls is to give dancers a challenge by surprising them with unexpected choreography. Many callers are very well known for their ability to put calls together to create a unique, smooth-flowing dance. Some callers are also known for the unusual and interesting formations they move the dancers through.  Singing calls  Singing calls are based on a sung delivery of calls, most often to a recognizable melody, and square dance calls are mixed in with the song's original lyrics. Many widely recognized songs have been turned into singing calls. The primary purpose of singing calls is to help the dancers relax, dance well together as a group, and enjoy the song and the caller's performance. Some callers are very well known for their voices, and for how well they can perform singing calls. There is often a very specific format for singing calls. Most singing calls are structured in an A-B-B-A-B- B-A format, with each section consisting of 64 beats. The \\"A\\" sections (the beginning, middle and end \\"break\\" sections) often involve simple moves done in a circular fashion, with no partner change. The \\"B\\" sections, known as the \\"figures\\", are often, especially at the lower levels of dancing, identical, and produce a partner change. Usually this means that at the end of each \\"B\\" section each \\"lady\\" moves to the next \\"gent\\" to her right. At the end of the final B section, each \\"lady\\" has returned to her original partner. Variations are occasionally seen; for example, the ladies may move left instead of right, or the last \\"A\\" section may be omitted. Singing calls, like patter calls, vary in dance difficulty, and are rarely improvised in full. They are uncommon above the Advanced program, although there are famous singing calls at the highest challenge levels.Stan Winchester is famous for his challenge-level singing calls. Stan Winchester Singing Call Page. = Programming = A modern Western square dance tip is composed of a combination of patter calls and singing calls. Usually one patter call is followed by one singing call to make a tip, although this is not universal. There are a number of ways that a caller programs the evening's entertainment. The caller might feature a particular music theme (such as a Rock and Roll party, or a Halloween festival), or might include variations of a particular dance call throughout the night. Generally callers start the evening slowly to warm dancers up, and to give them chances to succeed during the first tip. Then tempo and difficulty increases and peaks for most of the evenings. At the end of the evening there is usually a slower dance number at the end to relax the dancers, and to let them wind down. = Training to call = Calling a modern Western square dance requires a number of different skills and some natural talent; becoming a caller requires training‚Äî both educational training and \\"in front of the microphone\\" practice. Sometimes people who get the desire to call believe that it is enough to stand up on a platform, and sing the provided text to a square dance song, or call a pre-written sequence of patter. Difficult as even that can be for some, with some natural talent, a good ear for rhythm and timing, an engaging stage presence, and perhaps a robust singing voice, even a beginner can sound good. A caller has two main roles: * Teacher * Dance caller As a teacher, the caller must develop their educational skills, as well as the educational materials used in class. People skills are very important. As a dance caller, the caller must prepare choreographic material, and must be able to deliver it, whether by memory, or by using written sequences, or by using sight calling. The choreographic material must conform to a strict, basic set of choreographic rules: * Bring dancers back to their original partner * Bring partners home * And keep people dancing smoothly and enjoyably. Caller training is available, and Callerlab certifies instructors. The round dance cuer Round dance cuers recite rehearsed, pre- choreographed sequences of figures. Unlike callers in Salsa Rueda or modern western square dance, who invoke an execution of figures in an unexpected order that varies from one run of the dance to another, a round dance cuer only \\"cues\\", i.e., hints each subsequent figure of a predefined sequence, possibly already known to the dancers. The cuer, rather than being expected to call out original, on-the-fly choreography, is expected to know many (sometimes lengthy) dances and lead the floor through each one by appropriately and clearly stating the name of each successive step in the dance just in time to hear it before the last step has finished. Often cuing is from cards which list the steps in abbreviated notation. Cuing each step with proper timing is often tricky, as some dance steps can have very long names (\\"through-side-close to sidecar\\" for example), and there are times when a series of quick steps have been placed together, which requires quick speech, while maintaining good diction. Cuers are not expected (or even encouraged or suggested) to add patter. Rather, they speak more softly, and as quickly as possible to allow the dancers to enjoy as much of the song as possible. Cuers do not sing, either, except in rare occasions. Being more calm than most folk and country dances, round dance cuers are not expected to entertain; the act of dancing is the primary entertainment. Cuers are expected to also know the steps they are cuing well enough to teach them. At most round dances, there are a few pieces that most people know, but it is a cuer's job to also introduce new dances and teach them. Especially in both very early levels and very advanced levels, it is important that cuers can teach the steps, as several dances are listed as \\"Phase 2 + 1\\", meaning that the majority of the steps are at phase two, but there is one step added in from another level. The Salsa Rueda caller In Salsa Rueda, hand signs are used to complement voice calls; these are useful in noisy venues, where spoken calls might not be easily heard.

It was released on TAG Recordings, Scratchie Records, and Atlantic Records in 1996. Background College friends Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger had formed two failing bands before reconvening in Manhattan, where Collingwood managed to write future Fountains of Wayne songs \\"Joe Rey\\", \\"Leave the Biker\\" and \\"Radiation Vibe\\" in a half a day, then met with Schlesinger over drinks in order to start another band. According to Collingwood, \\"Basically, we started all this by writing a bunch of titles on bar napkins and trying to get the other guy to laugh. We'd get drunk and just sit there writing and laughing. We wound up with a list of hundreds of titles. Then we'd decide between the two of us who was going to take which song, and then meet the next night and see what we'd come up with.\\" Eventually it took a week to write the songs that were included on their debut album. Recording Fountains of Wayne was recorded when the band was just a duo, before the recruitment of drummer Brian Young and guitarist Jody Porter to the band. (Young and Porter are listed as bandmembers on later reissues of the record, but not on the original release.) Collingwood and Schlesinger provide all the instrumentation on the recording, except for the bass guitar parts, which were performed by guest bassist Danny Weinkauf, ex-The Belltower. Schlesinger and Porter had also been members of The Belltower, and Weinkauf later played with Lincoln before joining They Might Be Giants. Dominique Durand of the band Ivy, of which Schlesinger is also a member, provided backing vocals on \\"Survival Car\\". In 2016, Schlesinger explained the recording process: \\"On the recording, I was playing drums, Danny was playing bass and Chris was playing guitar. Then Chris and I would take turns doing some overdubs on guitar or a little keys. After we made the record, Danny decided to do other stuff (he‚Äôs now been touring and recording with They Might Be Giants for many years), and that‚Äôs when we found Jody and Brian and switched the line-up around, and I started playing bass.\\" The album's recording took a week and cost 5,000 dollars, with more money spent on mixing.. According to Collingwood, \\"It was deliberate that we were going to write the album and record it quickly, before we had time to think about anything. Prior to this, Adam and I had both been careful, serious songwriters, in the vein of Simon & Garfunkel. We were much more careful about the arrangements and everything. But when we decided to make this record quickly and spontaneously, we figured that since doing it so fast was such a stupid idea, the band needed a stupid name as well.\\" Cover The album's cover photo of a little boy clutching a rabbit and posing like a superhero was shot by Nick Waplington. It was also used for the album cover of Plastic Jewels by the UK band Flamingoes, which came out in the US two weeks before this album. According to Chris Collingwood, \\"This English photographer licensed the photograph to both bands. Worse than that, he was directly asked by us if he had licensed it to anybody else and he said no. So, basically, the guy's a complete asshole. We're changing the cover in Europe, but we're keeping it the same in the States. It's just too good a picture.\\" Release The album was met with moderate commercial success and favorable reviews. Songs from it were featured on MTV's 120 Minutes program.

Its mission was \\"to monitor the border between Uganda and Rwanda and verify that no military assistance was being provided across it\\". It was based in Kabale, Uganda and its mandate thus covered 193 miles of border. Countries contributing to UNOMUR included Bangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands, Senegal, Slovakia and Zimbabwe. Its chief military observer from June to October 1993 was Brigadier-General Rom√©o Dallaire of Canada, who later gained fame as Force Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. Dallaire arrived in Uganda in early October 1993, where the liaison officer from the National Resistance Army (NRA) informed him he must be informed of all UNOMUR patrols at least twelve hours in advance and that all patrols would have NRA escorts. When Dallaire protested that the whole point of the Mission was to discover suspicious activity through the element of surprise, the NRA officer insisted. Also despite the fact that Uganda had agreed that the area of verification would range 100 km inside the Ugandan border, which included the transport hub of Mbarara, the NRA insisted on a 20 km limit, putting Mbarara off limits.Dallaire, Rom√©o (2003). Shake Hands with the Devil. Carroll & Graf: New York. , pp. 93-96 Dallaire noted, > The border was a sieve, riddled with little mountain trails that had been > there for millennia. Given my tiny force of eighty-one observers and the > fact that we had no helicopters with night-vision capability, the task of > keeping the border under surveillance was at best symbolic.Dallaire 2003, p. > 95 Dallaire was soon appointed head of the new mission in Rwanda and left Uganda on October 21. His replacement as chief military observer was former second- in-command Colonel Ben Matiwaza of Zimbabwe, and later Colonel Asrarul Haque of Bangladesh. UNOMUR would later be placed under the command of UNAMIR. Following the genocide and outbreak of the Rwandan Civil War, its mandate ended on September 21, 1994.

It flows for just over from its source near Frozen Head State Park to its mouth along the Clinch River at Kingston, Tennessee. Hydrography The Emory River rises on the slopes of Fork Mountain and descends through a valley along the northern base of Bird Mountain, a prominent ridge in Frozen Head State Park in Morgan County. The surrounding area has been the subject of extensive strip mining for coal which has resulted in some stream pollution. The stream initially flows basically westward and is crossed by U.S. Highway 27. Turning more southwestward, it is paralleled for a time by a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway. It meets the Obed River in the southeast corner of the expansive Catoosa Wildlife Management Area, a large game-management area operated by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. Still paralleled by the railroad, the stream crosses into Roane County near Harriman. Backwaters of the Watts Bar Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River cause the water below Harriman to be somewhat slack. The Little Emory River is also impounded somewhat above its mouth into the Emory below Harriman. The mouth of the Emory is into the Clinch River at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Power Plant, a coal-fired electric generation station initially developed during World War II, largely to power the uranium enrichment plants used to make the world's first atomic bomb at nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The 2008 Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill heavily polluted the Emory River and surrounding area. Etymology According to a 1910 article in the Rockwood Times by Captain William E. McElwee,On the Roane County Heritage Commission website (accessed December 1, 2009), Robert L. Bailey advises that the stories in the historical articles that McElhee published in the Rockwood Times between 1902 and 1919 \\"must be taken with 'a grain of salt.'\\" the river was named after \\"William Emery\\", an early traveler who drowned while swimming the river with his \\"accoutrements\\" on. Early deed books sometimes refer to this as \\"William Emeries River\\".Tennessee, Roane County Deed Book D, pages 7 & 8 The Indian name for the Emory River was \\"Babahatchie\\", which means \\"babbling waters.\\" Roberts, Snyder E.

It connects the Buckhead area of Atlanta with Cumming. Its routing exists within portions of Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Forsyth counties. Route description Peachtree Corners SR 141 begins at an intersection with US 19/SR 9 (Roswell Road NE) in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, in Fulton County. It travels to the northeast to an intersection with SR 237 (Piedmont Road NE). Just after that intersection, it goes over, but does not have an interchange with SR 400 (T. Harvey Mathis Parkway). Immediately after is the southern terminus of SR 141 Connector (Lenox Road NE). The highway passes just northwest of the Buckhead Heights neighborhood, crosses into DeKalb County, and passes through Brookhaven. SR 141 passes Oglethorpe University and the Peachtree Golf Club, just before passing through Chamblee. In Doraville, it has an intersection with SR 13 Connector and an interchange with Interstate 285 (I-285). The road becomes a freeway on the northeast of the interchange, served by a pair of one-way frontage roads with \\"Texas U-turns\\"; it has a few exits along its length. It enters Gwinnett County near the middle of the freeway; near the end of the freeway is SR 140\\\\. It passes through Peachtree Corners. Then, it crosses over the Chattahoochee River back into Fulton County. It travels through Johns Creek and meets SR 120 (Abbotts Bridge Road). Northeast of there, it enters Forsyth County. The roadway curves to the northwest and then to the north. It has an interchange with US 19/SR 400 (Hospitality Highway), southwest of Cumming. Until 2020, SR 141 ended just to the northwest at SR 9, but it was extended north on Bethelview Road where it now ends at SR 20. SR 371 was removed from the state highway system as a mileage swap in order to add Bethelview Road to the state highway system. All of SR 141 from its southern terminus in Buckhead to a point southwest of Duluth is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Major intersections Related routes =Atlanta connector route= State Route 141 Connector (SR 141 Conn.) is a connecting route of SR 141 that exists entirely within the Buckhead section of Atlanta, in eastern Fulton County. It is known as Lenox Road NE, as well as Paul Coverdell Memorial Parkway, for its entire length. It was built in the early 1990s in conjunction with SR 400 to serve area businesses and offices. It begins at an intersection with the SR 141 mainline (Peachtree Road NE) just northwest of the Buckhead Heights neighborhood of Atlanta. The highway heads northwest, curves to the west-southwest underneath, where it crosses SR 400 (T. Harvey Mathis Parkway) with a single-point urban interchange. It curves to the southwest to meet its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 237 (Piedmont Road NE), at the Buckhead Forest neighborhood of Atlanta. SR 141 Conn. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =Gwinnett County connector route= State Route 141 Connector (SR 141 Conn.) is a .8 mile long (1.3 km) connecting route of SR 141 that exists entirely within Gwinnett County. It is just west of Norcross. The route at SR 140 (Jimmy Carter Boulevard) and goes north along a frontage road parallel to SR 141/Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. After the split of SR 141 and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, SR 141 Conn. merges with Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. The route then turns left onto Holcomb Bridge Road and ends at the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and SR 141. The route connects traffic from SR 140 to SR 141 north, since there is no direct entrance ramp between these two roads. SR 141 Conn. south does not exist because traffic can exit from SR 141 south directly to SR 140. =Peachtree Industrial Boulevard= Peachtree Industrial Boulevard is a road in the U.S. state of Georgia that begins in Chamblee and ends in Buford. Between Interstate 285 and SR 140 (Jimmy Carter Boulevard), the road is concurrent with SR 141. North of SR 140, in Peachtree Corners, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard splits from SR 141 and continues to the northeast as a highway with at least four lanes and center median, traveling through the cities of Peachtree Corners, Duluth, Suwanee, Sugar Hill, and Buford. The portion of the road concurrent with SR 141 is maintained by the state; the rest is maintained by Gwinnett County. Peachtree Industrial Boulevard was originally built in the 1960s. The portion of the road concurrent to SR 141 was upgraded to a limited-access highway in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2008, the section within the city limits of Chamblee was renamed to Peachtree Boulevard, to reflect the changing nature of the city. https://atlanta.curbed.com/2015/1/30/9997144/peachtree-industrial-boulevard- and-the-new-chamblee Prior to this change, the \\"industrial\\" name extended until Peachtree Road merges in near the city line with present-day Brookhaven. In November 2018, the Doraville City Council passed a resolution to authorize the city manager to rename Peachtree Industrial Boulevard within the city limits to Peachtree Boulevard, following the changes made by Chamblee. However, these changes have not yet taken place. In 2013, Gwinnett County decreased the speed limit the road to 45 mph between SR 141 (Peachtree Parkway) and SR 20 (Nelson Brogdon Boulevard) and 50 mph between SR 20 and the Hall County line. The goal of the change was to reduce speeding and accidents. In June 2018, the Atlanta Regional Commission Board approved funding to equip intersections along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard with connected vehicle technology. Gwinnett County has looked at adding and improving sidewalks along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/static/departments/boc/pdf/2017%20SPLOST%20Transportation%20Projects.pdf The Western Gwinnett Bikeway is a multi-use trail under construction along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard.  Orphaned segments  There are six road segments that previously carried State Route 141 or a derivative designation that no longer do. # What is now Georgia SR 371 once was SR 141 between Georgia SR 9 and SR 20. It was changed to its present number in 1971. It was removed from the state highway system in 2020 when SR 141 was extended north along Bethelview Road, essentially replacing its original route with a new alignment. # The State Route 141 designation was previously used in DeKalb County between Tucker and US 78 in what is now Stone Mountain Park on what is now Hugh Howell Highway (SR 236) which was at the time named Rosser Road. # Prior to construction of Peachtree Parkway and the extension and re-routing of SR 141 to Buckhead, SR 141 followed what is present day Medlock Bridge Road from its current intersection with Peachtree Parkway, into downtown Norcross and became North Peachtree Road, crossed the railroad tracks at Park Street, and then traveled on South Peachtree until its terminus at Buford Highway (SR 13). When plans were drawn to re-route SR 141 to its present alignment, GDOT changed the designation of this roadway to SR 141 Connector. This designation stayed in effect until 1981, when this segment was turned over to the county and converted to local roads. What is now SR 141 between the Buckhead junction with Roswell Road (SR 9) and Motors Industrial Way (present day SR 13 Connector) was designated along with Motors Industrial Way as SR 13W before it was made part of the newly aligned SR 141. # With the construction of Interstate 85, Norcross Tucker road, which at the time was a contiguous road, was designated SR 141 Connector, and the small segment of South Peachtree Road between Buford Highway and Norcross Tucker Road was redesigned SR 141 Spur. The South Peachtree Road (SR 141 Spur) was converted to a local road in 1981 along with truncation of SR 141 Connector to Norcross Tucker Road between South Peachtree Rd in Norcross and Interstate 85. # As Jimmy Carter Boulevard was constructed in the 1970s, Norcross Tucker Road was split into North Norcross Tucker Road and South Norcross Tucker Road, and a portion of the road was incorporated into Jimmy Carter Boulevard. In 1981, Jimmy Carter Boulevard was designated as SR 141 Connector between Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and Interstate 85. It was converted to State Route 140 in 1984-1985 timeframe and the SR 141 Connector designation was used for what is present day SR 141 Connector at the 141/Peachtree Industrial Boulevard interchange when the Jimmy Carter Boulevard/SR 141 intersection was upgraded to a grade separated intersection. # The 17.5 mile segment of State Route 369 East of SR 9 from North of Cumming to Gainesville was designated as SR 141 until 1970, when it was extended west to SR 20, and redesigned to its present-day number.

It is native to Africa. Description Herbaceous species and hybrids have narrow, grass-like leaves long, while evergreen species have broader, strap-shaped foliage up to long. All plants produce spikes of upright, brightly coloured flowers well above the foliage, in shades of red, orange and yellow, often bicoloured. The flowers produce copious nectar while blooming and are attractive to bees and sunbirds. In the New World they may attract nectarivores such as hummingbirds and New World orioles. Etymology The genus Kniphofia is named after Johann Hieronymus Kniphof, an 18th-century German physician and botanist. Cultivation Several species of Kniphofia are cultivated as garden plants, valued for their architectural properties. These include K. galpini, K. northiae, K. rooperi and K. thomsonii.

The musical is a satire on politics and foreign policy that spoofs postwar America's penchant for lending billions of dollars to needy countries. It centers on Sally Adams, a well-meaning but ill- informed socialite widow, who is appointed United States Ambassador to the fictional European country of Lichtenburg (unconnected to the real Lichtenburg which came to fame in 1945 as a concentration camp, but ironically with the inhabitants being clearly Germanic). Signs in Lichtenburg are written in German, and inhabitants wear traditional Bavarian costume. While there, she charms the local gentry, especially Cosmo Constantine, while her press attach√© Kenneth Gibson falls in love with Princess Maria. Background The lead character is based on Washington, D.C. hostess and Democratic Party fundraiser Perle Mesta, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949. The Playbill distributed at each performance humorously noted that \\"neither the character of Mrs. Sally Adams nor Miss Ethel Merman resemble any person living or dead.\\" In 1949, Merman and her family were vacationing at the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs with Howard Lindsay and his wife Dorothy Stickney. Watching Merman poolside while reading a magazine article about Mesta, Lindsay was struck by how typically \\"American\\" she was and immediately envisioned her portraying a colorful character similar to the newly appointed ambassador. When he proposed the idea to Merman, who had little interest in either society or political news, she responded, \\"Who's Perle Mesta?\\"Kellow, Brian, Ethel Merman: A Life. New York: Viking Press 2007. , pp. 121-142 Although Merman had announced she was interested in playing a dramatic role in her next project, Lindsay and Russel Crouse approached Irving Berlin and began working on the book for Call Me Madam when he expressed interest in composing the score. Berlin's last production, Miss Liberty, had failed to recoup its investment, and he was determined to repeat the success he had had with Annie Get Your Gun. The three collaborators agreed they needed to treat their subject with care to avoid any legal action by Mesta. As the work progressed, Merman conceded she would be willing to sing two or three songs, but eventually accepted the fact she was going to star in a full-scale musical comedy instead of the drama she preferred. Producer Leland Hayward budgeted the production at $250,000. In exchange for the original cast recording and television broadcast rights, he arranged to have it financed 100% by RCA Records and NBC, with the two sharing 35% of the net earnings. In order to increase the profits, Hayward decided to charge an all-time high of $7.20 for orchestra seats. Hayward hired George Abbott to direct, and Abbott and casting director Harold Prince auditioned thousands of actors for the twenty speaking roles and twenty-nine chorus members. Raoul Pene du Bois was hired to design sets and costumes, although the wardrobe worn by Merman was the responsibility of Mainbocher. Once the script was completed, everyone agreed that, while it was little more than standard situation comedy material, it was a perfect vehicle for Merman, and that Berlin's score, although far from his best, was tuneful and memorable. It included the comic song \\"Mr. Monotony\\", which originally was written for and dropped from the film Easter Parade. Berlin had then included it in Miss Liberty, but it was dropped from that as well. In this instance, the third time was not the charm: during out-of-town tryouts, Merman insisted it be dropped. (In 1988, Sarah Brightman recorded it for her CD The Songs That Got Away.) To fill the hole its omission left in the second act, Berlin wrote \\"Something to Dance About\\" to give the second act a lively opening. When the star requested a duet with Russell Nype playing her lovestruck press attach√©, Berlin responded by writing the counterpoint tune \\"You're Just in Love\\" and it ultimately became a showstopper at every performance. Productions Directed by George Abbott and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, the musical premiered at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut on September 11, 1950. Reviews were mixed - Variety said it \\"inspires warm applause rather than cheer\\"‚Äîand Berlin wrote two new songs to bolster the sagging second act. It opened in Boston on September 19, and while The Boston Record thought it offered \\"only an occasional flash of inspirational fire\\", it played to standing-room-only audiences throughout the run. With a record advance sale of $2 million, the Broadway production opened on October 12 at the Imperial Theatre, where it ran for 644 performances and grossed more than $4 million. In addition to Merman and Nype, the cast included Paul Lukas, Pat Harrington, Sr., Galina Talva, Lilia Skala, Tommy Rall and Richard Eastham. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times thought it offered one of Berlin's \\"most enchanting scores: fresh, light, and beguiling, and fitted to lyrics that fall out of it with grace and humor\\", and the New York Post called Merman \\"indescribably soul-satisfying\\", \\"a comedienne of rare skill\\", and \\"one of the joys of the world.\\" She remained with the show for the entire run and appeared in the limited four-week engagement staged to celebrate the reopening of the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. Apart from playing Rose in the first national tour of Gypsy, the role of Sally Adams in Call Me Madam would be the only stage role which Ethel Merman would reprise after originating it on Broadway. In July 1965 Merman would headline a revival by the Valley Music Theater in which Richard Eastham and Russell Nype also reprised their Broadway roles: the production playing an encore engagement - without Nype - in Houston that October. Merman, Eastham and Nype again reprised their Broadway roles for a 1967 summer stock tour of Call Me Madam in which Donna McKechnie was originally featured as Princess Maria, a role assumed by Carole Wells before the tour's end. The national tour of Call Me Madam was headlined by Elaine Stritch: Merman's understudy during the show's Broadway run, Stritch had never had occasion to perform as Sally Adams at the Imperial, her debut in the role being at a matinee performance during the show's May 1952 Washington D.C. engagement. Subsequent to engagements at the Nixon Theater in Pittsburgh and the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland - with respective openings on June 2 and June 9, 1952 - the Call Me Madam national tour opened at the Philharmonic Auditorium June 23, 1952 with further engagements in nine other cities - including Chicago and Detroit - the finale being an engagement at the Iroquois Park Amphitheater in Louisville in August 1953. Throughout most of the tour Stritch's leading man was Kent Smith as Cosmo Constantine, although Dick Smart would take over the role before the tour's end. The cast of the national tour also included Pat Harrington, Sr. and Jay Velie reprising their Broadway roles. Stritch would reprise the role of Sally Adams in two regional theatrical productions, headlining Call Me Madam for St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre in 1954 - with Russell Nype reprising his Broadway role - and for the Valley Forge Music Fair in 1956. Call Me Madam returned to the New York stage for the first time since its original Broadway run via the New York City Center Encores! semi-staged concert version - with Tyne Daly headlining a cast including Walter Charles as Cosmo Constantine, Lewis Cleale as Kenneth and Melissa Errico as Princess Maria. Presented in February 1995 Encores 1995 listing broadwayworld.com, accessed March 3, 2009 as the inaugural production of Encores! second season, Call Me Madam was lauded as the company's first hit production. Encores! would present a fully-staged production of Call Me Madam in February 2019, with Carmen Cusack headlining a cast which included Darrell Hammond as Grand Duke Otto, Carol Kane as Grand Duchess Sophie, Stanley Wayne Mathis as Senator Borckbank, Randy Rainbow as Sebastian Sebastian, and Lauren Worsham as Princess Maria.https://www.stageleft.nyc/blog/2019/2/7/review-encores-call-me- madam-with-carmen-cusack Call Me Madam had its premiere regional theatrical engagement at the Dallas State Fair in August 1952: with Joan Blondell headlining and Russell Nype reprising his Broadway role, the cast also included William LeMassena as Pemberton Maxwell, Michael Pollock as Sebastian Sebastian and Gene Raymond as Cosmo Constantine. In 1959 Constance Bennett would headline a production of Call Me Madam, featuring Wilbur Evans as Cosmo Constantine, which played engagements at the Camden County Music Fair and at the Storrowtown Music Fair. Also in 1959 Penny Singleton would headline a 1959 production by the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre in which both Russell Nype and Pat Harrington, Sr. reprised their Broadway roles. Wilbur Evans would reprise the role of Cosmo Constantine in a 1963 production headlined by Martha Raye which played engagements at the Valley Forge Music Fair and at the Storrowtown Music Fair, with Kenneth Gibson being played by James Kirkwood. Margaret Whiting, who headlined a 1961 production of Call Me Madam which played engagements in Boston and New Jersey, would in 1966 headline the play's Melody Top summer stock production in Milwaukee which featured Tommy Sands as Kenneth Gibson. Jo Anne Worley, who headlined the 1987 Pasadena Convention Center production of Call Me Madam, would also headline a semi-staged concert version mounted in 2001 at the Auditorium Theatre (Chicago) with Malcolm Gets as Kenneth Gibson and Fred Willard. Leslie Uggams would headline a revival of Call Me Madam mounted at the Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, in April‚ÄìMay 1996: the additional cast included J. B. Adams as Henry Gibson/ Grand Duke Otto, Mark Baker as Pemberton Maxwell, and Vanessa Dorman as Princess Maria.Klein, Alvin. \\"From Washington to Lichtenburg via Berlin\\", The New York Times, April 21, 1996. In September 2000 Call Me Madam was mounted at the UCLA Freud Playhouse with Karen Morrow headlining a cast which included Robert Mandan as Pemberton Maxwell, Michael Nouri as Cosmo Constantine, Hugh Panaro as Kenneth Gibson, and Michael Tucci as Congressman Wilkins. Other regional productions of Call Me Madam have been headlined by Maxene Andrews (Coachlight Dinner Theater East Windsor CT/ 1976), Klea Blackhurst (42nd Street Moon San Francisco/ 2009), Kim Criswell with Catherine Brunell as Princess Maria and David Hess as Cosmo Constantine (Goodspeed Musicals Middlesex County CT/ 2004), Ruta Lee (Casa Ma√±ana Fort Worth/ 1978), and Helen Reddy with Monte Markham as Cosmo Constantine (Sacramento Civic Light Opera/ 1986). Call Me Madam opened in the West End at the London Coliseum on March 15, 1952 for a run of 486 performances: Billie Worth headlined a cast which included Anton Walbrook as Cosmo Constantine and Shani Wallis - in her first major stage role - as Princess Maria.Call Me Madam listing broadwayworld.com, accessed March 3, 2009. Noele Gordon - who had understudied Worth during the Coliseum run of Call Me Madam - headlined the production's British touring edition in 1953 and in 1983 would headline a West End revival whose cast also included Jeremy Hawk as Pemberton Maxwell and Basil Hoskins as Cosmo Constantine: opening March 14, 1983, the production was afforded a seven-week run at the Victoria Palace. Call Me Madam has since had two evident London fringe productions, the first at Upstairs at The Gatehouse in the summer of 2009 with Thom Southerland directing a cast which included Beverley Klein as Sally Adams, Chris Love as Kenneth Gibson, Kate Nelson as Princess Maria, and Gido Schimanski as Cosmo Constantine. Subsequently, the Union Theatre, London would mount Call Me Madam in the fall of 2012: staged and directed by Michael Strassen, the production - headlined by Lucy Williamson leading as cast which included Gavin Kerr, Leo Miles and Natalie Lipin - received five nominations at the Off West End Awards and was named as one of the productions when the Union won Best Fringe at The Stage Awards in 2013 alongside The Globe (Best Theatre). Call Me Madam began its inaugural Australian engagement on September 5, 1953 at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne: with Evie Hayes headlining a cast which also included David Cahill as Hugo Tantinnin and Alec Kellaway as Congressman Wilkins, the production would play subsequent engagement in Brisbane and Sydney.\\"Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1981-1990\\" books.google.com, accessed March 4, 2018 Revived in 1985 at the Canberra Theatre with June Bronhill headlining and David Branson featured as Cosmo Constantine, Call Me Madam would in 2000 be mounted at the Arts Centre Melbourne with Geraldine Turner headlining a cast which included Rachael Beck as Princess Maria, Reg Gorman as Congressman Wilkins, and Spencer McLaren as Kenneth Gibson.

The recording rights had been granted to RCA Victor, which had invested in the show, but Merman was under contract to Decca Records, which refused to allow her to record the original cast album. Decca issued a 10-inch LP featuring Merman singing some of her songs, accompanied by arranger-conductor Gordon Jenkins and His Orchestra and Chorus, with vocalizing by Dick Haymes (who joined Merman in the show's biggest hit, \\"You're Just in Love\\", their single reaching Billboard magazine's number 30 for a week) and Eileen Wilson (who sang \\"It's a Lovely Day Today\\" with Haymes). RCA Victor went ahead with the original cast album replacing Merman with Dinah Shore. Merman was called back into the Decca studios to record additional songs from the show, and the label quickly re-released the album as a 12-inch LP under the title Ethel Merman: 12 Songs from Call Me Madam. The Victor album sold reasonably well, attaining the sixth spot on the Billboard popular album charts, but the LP was out of print from 1956 until RCA Red Seal reissued it briefly in 1977. Peaking at number two on Billboards popular album charts, Merman's Decca recording, which would appear on MCA Records beginning in 1973, stayed steadily in print until the end of the LP era. Merman's Madam album currently is available on a Decca Broadway CD, which also features Merman singing four Cole Porter tunes from the stage score of Panama Hattie (1940). Merman also is heard on the film soundtrack album (with Donald O'Connor and George Sanders), issued in 1953 as a 10-inch album, also on the Decca label. Scoring fifth position on Billboard \\"s popular albums charts when first released, the soundtrack, taken out of print in 1957, was reissued in 1981 by Stet Records on a 12-inch LP which also contained songs from the film scores of Guys and Dolls (1955) and I'll Cry Tomorrow (1955). The Merman soundtrack has not been legally updated to a CD. A 1995 Broadway concert cast album, featuring Tyne Daly, Lewis Cleale, Christopher Durang, Ken Page, and Melissa Errico, is available on the DRG label. The original London West End cast recording, starring Billie Worth and Anton Walbrook, has been released on the Sepia label. Promotional appearances On the premiere episode of NBC Radio's The Big Show on November 5, 1950, original Broadway cast members Ethel Merman, Paul Lukas, and Russell Nype appeared in the first half-hour (of the hour-and-a-half program) and performed songs from the score in order of their appearance in the production, while host Tallulah Bankhead filled in story notes between songs (although accidentally missing one story cue). Merman sang \\"The Hostess With the Mostes' on the Ball,\\" then Lukas sang \\"Lichtenburg,\\" then Merman sang \\"Can You Use Any Money Today?\\" and \\"The Best Thing for You (Would Be Me),\\" and finally Merman sang \\"You're Just in Love\\" with Nype.The Big Show from November 5, 1950 The Big Show - Single Episodes from the Old Time Radio Researchers Group at the Internet Archive, accessed November 6, 2010.

The story takes place in Vienna, from 1911 until 1938. It follows the life of a penniless Jewish composer and his love for two women of different social classes, set against the background of Nazi persecution. The piece opened in 1939 in London's West End, starring Novello. Like many of Novello's musicals, The Dancing Years was given an expensive, spectacular production, with several scene changes and a large cast. Synopsis Rudi, a penniless young Jewish composer, plays the piano at an Austrian country inn, where he has been friends, since childhood with the innkeeper's daughter, Grete; they pledged to marry some day. He falls in love with Maria, an opera singer, for whom he composes successful operas. Three years later, Grete has become a musical theatre star. Maria overhears Rudi proposing to Grete in jest. Maria misunderstands and returns to Vienna to marry her older patron and former lover, Prince Metterling. Maria bears Rudi's son, Otto, who is brought up to believe that he is Metterling's son. More than a decade later, Maria introduces Rudi to Otto. Rudi and Maria discover that they are still love with each other, but Rudi decides that he cannot break up her marriage for the sake of their son. After more than another decade passes, Rudi is sentenced to death by the Nazis for helping Jews to escape Austria, but Maria uses her husband's connections to get a reprieve for him.  Productions  The musical was first produced at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 23 March 1939, directed by Novello's frequent collaborator Leontine Sagan. Novello starred opposite Mary Ellis. It closed at the start of the Second World War in September 1939 after 187 performances. After a three-year provincial tour, the show reopened at the Adelphi Theatre on 14 March 1942, running there until July 1944, for a total of 969 performances. It was the most popular show of the war and earned an estimated ¬£1,000,000. After this, the show toured extensively in Britain and was revived numerous times, including in London, and was adapted for film and television. The 1968 West End revival starred June Bronhill.Gordon, Robert and Olaf Jubin (eds).

Her feast day is kept on 3 January. She was born in Nanterre and moved to Paris (then known as Lutetia) after encountering Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes and dedicated herself to a Christian life.McNamara, Halborg, and Whatley 18. In 451 she led a \\"prayer marathon\\"McNamara, Halborg, and Whatley 4. that was said to have saved Paris by diverting Attila's Huns away from the city. When the Germanic king Childeric I besieged the city in 464, she acted as an intermediary between the city and its besiegers, collecting food and convincing Childeric to release his prisoners. Her following and her status as patron saint of Paris were promoted by Clotilde, who may have commissioned the writing of her vita. This was most likely written in Tours, where Clotilde retired after her husband's death, as evidenced also by the importance of Martin of Tours as a saintly model. Life Saint Genevieve praying to stop the rain during the harvest (Notre-Dame de Paris) Though there is a vita that purports to be written by a contemporary, Genevieve's history cannot be separated from her hagiography. She was described as a peasant girl born in Nanterre to Severus (a Gallo- Roman) and Geroncia (Greek origins). On his way to Britain, Germanus of Auxerre stopped at Nanterre, and Genevieve confided to him that she wanted to live only for God. He encouraged her and at the age of fifteen, Genevieve became a nun. On the deaths of her parents, she went to live with her godmother Lutetia in Paris (\\"Lutetia\\" was the former name of the city of Paris, so this has symbolic weight). There the young woman became admired for her piety and devotion to works of charity, and practiced corporal austerities which included abstaining from meat and breaking her fast only twice in the week. \\"These mortifications she continued for over thirty years, till her ecclesiastical superiors thought it their duty to make her diminish her austerities.\\"MacErlean, Andrew. \\"St. Genevieve.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 19 Jul. 2014 She encountered opposition and criticism for her activities, both before and after she was again visited by Germanus from those who were jealous or considered her an impostor or hypocrite. Genevieve had frequent visions of heavenly saints and angels. She reported her visions and prophecies, until her enemies conspired to drown her in a lake. Through the intervention of Germanus, their animosity was finally overcome. The Bishop of Paris appointed her to look after the welfare of the virgins dedicated to God, and by her instruction and example she led them to a high degree of sanctity. Shortly before the attack of the Huns under Attila in 451 on Paris, Genevieve and Germanus' archdeacon persuaded the panic-stricken people of Paris not to flee but to pray. It is claimed that the intercession of Genevieve's prayers caused Attila's army to go to Orl√©ans instead. During Childeric's siege and blockade of Paris in 464, Genevieve passed through the siege lines in a boat to Troyes, bringing grain to the city. She also pleaded to Childeric for the welfare of prisoners-of- war, and met with a favorable response. Through her influence, Childeric and Clovis displayed unwonted clemency towards the citizens. Genevieve cherished a particular devotion to Saint Denis, and wished to erect a chapel in his honor to house his relics. Around 475 Genevieve purchased some land at the site of his burial and exhorted the neighboring priests to use their utmost endeavors. When they replied that they had no lime, she sent them to the bridge of Paris, where they learned the whereabouts of large quantities of this material from the conversation of two swineherds. After this the building proceeded successfully.Hinds, Allen Banks. Hinds, ‚ÄúSaint Genevieve‚Äù. A Garner of Saints, 1900.

Retrieved 25 December 2019. Death and burial Front of the Church of the former Abbey of St Genevieve, which she was said to have inspired Clovis I founded an abbey where Genevieve might minister, and where she herself was later buried. Under the care of the Benedictines, who established a monastery there, the church witnessed numerous miracles wrought at her tomb. As Genevieve was popularly venerated there, the church was rededicated in her name; people eventually enriched the church with their gifts. It was plundered by the Vikings in 847 and was partially rebuilt, but was completed only in 1177. In 1129, when the city was suffering from an epidemic of ergot poisoning, this \\"burning sickness\\" was stayed after Saint Genevieve's relics were carried in a public procession. This was repeated annually with the relics being brought to the cathedral; Mme de S√©vign√© gave a description of the pageant in one of her letters. The relief from the epidemic is still commemorated in the churches of Paris. Tomb of Saint Genevieve in the church of Saint Etienne du Mont After the old church fell into decay, Louis XV ordered a new church worthy of the patron saint of Paris; he entrusted the Marquis of Marigny with the construction. The marquis gave the commission to his prot√©g√© Jacques-Germain Soufflot, who planned a neo-classical design. After Soufflot's death, the church was completed by his pupil, Jean-Baptiste Rondelet. The Revolution broke out before the new church was dedicated. It was taken over in 1791 by the National Constituent Assembly and renamed the Panth√©on, to be a burial place for distinguished Frenchmen. It became an important monument in Paris. Though Saint Genevieve's relics had been publicly burnt at the Place de Gr√®ve in 1793 during the French Revolution, the Panth√©on was restored to Catholic purposes in 1821. In 1831 it was secularized again as a national mausoleum, but returned to the Catholic Church in 1852. Though the Communards were said to have dispersed the relics (there is no proof of this allegation, the relics having been burnt in 1793), some managed to be recovered. In 1885 the Catholic Church reconsecrated the structure to St. Genevieve. Canons of Saint Genevieve The Panth√©on, Paris About 1619 Louis XIII named Cardinal Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld abbot of Saint Genevieve's. The canons had been lax and the cardinal selected Charles Faure to reform them. This holy man was born in 1594, and entered the canons regular at Senlis. He was remarkable for his piety, and, when ordained, succeeded after a hard struggle in reforming the abbey. Many of the houses of the canons regular adopted his reform. In 1634, he and a dozen companions took charge of Saint- Genevi√®ve-du-Mont of Paris. This became the mother-house of a new congregation, the Canons Regular of Ste. Genevieve, which spread widely over France. The institute named after the saint was the Daughters of Ste. Genevi√®ve, founded at Paris in 1636, by Francesca de Blosset, with the object of nursing the sick and teaching young girls. A somewhat similar institute, popular buriel Miramiones, had been founded under the invocation of the Holy Trinity in 1611 by Marie Bonneau de Rubella Beauharnais de Miramion. These two institutes were united in 1665, and the associates called the Canonesses of Ste. Genevi√®ve. The members took no vows, but merely promised obedience to the rules as long as they remained in the institute. Suppressed during the Revolution, the institute was revived in 1806 by Jeanne-Claude Jacoulet under the name of the Sisters of the Holy Family.

He led the National League in fielding percentage seven times and in assists six times, with both marks remaining league records until Ozzie Smith surpassed them in the 1980s; he also led the NL in double plays four times and in putouts twice. He won the 1890 batting title with a .336 average for the New York Giants and led the league in hits twice; in his final season he became the sixth major league player to make 2,000 hits. He was the first player to appear in over 600 games as a shortstop, and ended his career with major league records for games (1,628), putouts (2,821), assists (5,630), total chances (9,283), double plays (620) and fielding percentage (.910) at the position. When he retired he ranked fifth in major league history in games (1,736) and at bats (7,030), seventh in total bases (2,630) and eighth in doubles (313). Biography Jack Glasscock was born in Wheeling, West Virginia (then Virginia) to Thomas Glasscock (born 1830) and the former Julia Collette (born 1833), and dropped out of school in fourth grade to pursue his father's trade of carpentry. Nicknamed \\"Pebbly Jack\\" for his habit of scrutinizing the infield for small stones, typically pocketing them, the practice helped him to avoid the bad-hop ground balls which more regularly afflicted other infielders; fielding averages of the era rarely exceeded .900 among shortstops. He played for the local Standard club in 1876, the Champion City club of Springfield, Ohio in 1877, and the Pittsburgh Allegheny Base Ball Club of the International Association in 1878, the latter at third base. After Allegheny folded, he finished the season with Cleveland and broke into the National League with that club in 1879, the first West Virginian in the majors. After playing second and third bases as a rookie, he switched to shortstop permanently in 1880 with Fred Dunlap taking over at second. In 1881 he led the NL in putouts (105), assists (274) and fielding average (.911) for the first time. Over five seasons with the team he gradually improved his hitting, and in 1882 he was among the league's top ten players in home runs (4), doubles (27), slugging average (.450) and total bases (161) while also leading the league in assists (311) and tying Sadie Houck's major league record of 40 double plays, set the previous year; Frank Fennelly set a new major league mark with 46 for the 1885 Cincinnati Red Stockings in the American Association. In 1883, batting third, Glasscock led the team in runs batted in, and paced the NL in fielding again with a .922 average. In mid-1884 he jumped to the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds of the Union Association during that league's only season of play and batted .419 in 38 games. Jack Glasscock cigarette card (Goodwin & Company, 1888) He returned to the NL with the St. Louis Maroons for the next two years, becoming team captain. In 1885 he set an NL record for assists (397), breaking Arthur Irwin's 1880 mark of 339, and led the league in fielding average (.917); he also moved ahead of Davy Force to become the major league career leader in games at shortstop. In 1886 he hit .325 and was fifth in the league in doubles and sixth in hits, also breaking his own NL record with 43 double plays and again leading the NL in assists (392) and fielding (.906). The Maroons moved to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Hoosiers before the 1887, and Glasscock continued his solid output in Indianapolis with a .294 average that year. He also set new major league records for assists (493) and double plays (58), topping Fennelly's totals of 485 and 54 with the previous year's Red Stockings. Ollie Beard broke his major league assists mark with 537 for the 1889 Red Stockings, and Bob Allen set a new NL mark with 500 for the 1890 Philadelphia Phillies. Glasscock led the league in fielding (.901) again in 1888, and would later break his own NL double play record with 60 in 1889, though Beard set a new major league mark with 63 the same year; Allen broke the NL mark with 68 in 1890. 1889 marked Glasscock's top all-around season as he batted .352 - second in the NL behind Dan Brouthers, and the best average by a major league shortstop prior to 1893, when the pitching distance was increased to - and led the league in hits (205). He was second in doubles (40, behind King Kelly) and total bases (272, behind Jimmy Ryan), and was fifth in the league with a career-high 128 runs. Furthermore, he led the league in every defensive category (246 putouts, 478 assists, 60 double plays, .915 average). His 246 putouts set a new NL record, breaking John Montgomery Ward's 1887 major league record of 226 (Herman Long had 335 for the 1889 American Association Kansas City Cowboys); Bob Allen would also break this record just a year later. Glasscock hit for the cycle on August 8 of that year; he also managed the team for the last half of the season, posting a 34‚Äì32 record. Early in the year, he discovered 17-year-old future Hall of Famer Amos Rusie pitching for a local semi-pro team, and the young hurler was promptly acquired for Indianapolis. When the Hoosiers folded after the 1889 season, his contract - as well as Rusie's - was awarded to the Giants to replace Ward, who was leading many of the sport's top players in a shift to the Players' League for the 1890 season. Glasscock had been intending to switch leagues as well but was expelled from the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players after signing his 1890 contract with Indianapolis. He won the 1890 batting championship by eleven points over Billy Hamilton, going 6-for-6 on September 27; he also became the second player to lead the NL in hits two years in a row (joining Brouthers), and was second in doubles to Sam Thompson and fifth in total bases. His offensive totals dropped off in later seasons, partially as a result of an 1891 hand injury. When the American Association merged with the NL prior to the 1892 season, Glasscock shifted to the St. Louis Browns (the team now known as the Cardinals), hitting .241 and .267 in two full seasons; he also managed the team for the first four games of the 1892 season, going 1‚Äì3. In June 1893 he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and he hit .341 over the remainder of the year, finishing with a .320 average and also with 100 RBI for the first time. The team finished only five games out of first place, the closest he would come to a league title during his major league career. He batted .280 in his last full season in 1894, leading the NL in fielding for the last time with a .933 average, and ended his major league career in 1895, splitting the year between the Louisville Colonels and the Washington Senators. Glasscock left the major leagues with a .290 career batting average, 2040 hits, 27 home runs, 1163 runs, 825 runs batted in and 98 triples. He was one of the most difficult players of the 19th century to strike out, doing so just once in every 33 at bats. He played a notable role in the advancement of defensive tactics, being one of the first shortstops to use signals indicating which infielder would cover second base on steal attempts, and also one of the first to back up throws to the second baseman. Germany Smith broke his records for career assists and total chances in 1897, and his mark for games at shortstop in 1898. Herman Long broke his record for putouts in 1898, and his mark for double plays in . Tommy Corcoran bettered his career fielding percentage by the end of the 19th century. Glasscock returned to Wheeling and played on a minor league team run by Ed Barrow, winning the first pennant of his career; he remained in the minor leagues as a first baseman until 1901, winning an 1896 batting title with a .431 average. After his baseball career ended, he returned to carpentry. He died in Wheeling from a stroke at age 89.

Because its design goal was to obtain cross-platform high performance, ZPL programs run fast on both sequential and parallel computers. Highly-parallel ZPL programs are simple and easy to write because it exclusively uses implicit parallelism. Originally called Orca C, ZPL was designed and implemented during 1993‚Äì1995 by the Orca Project of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington. Details ZPL uses the array abstraction to implement a data parallel programming model. This is the reason why ZPL achieves such good performance: having no parallel directives or other forms of explicit parallelism, ZPL exploits the operational trait that when aggregate computations are described in terms of arrays, many scalar operations must be (implicitly) performed to implement the array operations. This implied computation can be automatically allotted to different processors to achieve concurrency: Parallelism arises from the semantics of the array operations. ZPL is translated into a conventional abstract syntax tree representation on which program analysis and program optimizations are performed. ANSI C code is generated as the object code. This C program (which is machine independent because it implements certain operations in abstract form) is then compiled using the native C compiler on the target machine with custom libraries optimized to the specific platform. The creators of ZPL were: Brad Chamberlain, Sung-Eun Choi, E Christopher Lewis, Calvin Lin, Jason Secosky, Larry Snyder, and W. Derrick Weathersby with assistance from Ruth Anderson, A.J.

On 12 September 1958, the Naval Reserve Medal was declared discontinued and was replaced by the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. It is not to be confused with the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal which is a different award that was discontinued on 1 January 2014https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers- npc/reference/messages/Documents/ALNAVS/ALN2014/ALN14025.txt. The Naval Reserve Medal was awarded to any commissioned officer or enlisted member of United States Naval Reserve (USNR), the associated National Naval Volunteers, and local naval militia units of the period. To be awarded the decoration, a service member was required to perform ten years of continuous service in one of the aforementioned components in either an active duty, drilling reservist, or inactive status. An additional award of the NRM is denoted by a service star. The United States Marine Corps equivalent to the award is the Marine Corps Reserve Ribbon. The Naval Reserve Medal originally held precedence just below that of the Navy Good Conduct Medal which, in turn, held precedence just below unit awards. Sometime after 1958, the precedence of the Naval Reserve Medal was moved to rank just below the Armed Forces Reserve Medal making it the lowest ranking medal awarded by the United States Armed Forces aside from the Navy and Coast Guard expert marksmanship medals. As the NRM was only available for exactly 20 years and 0 days, and required 10 years and 0 days USNR service, no sailor could possibly receive more than two. Additionally, with World War II (WW II) pulling the vast majority of Naval Reservists into active duty the Regular Navy, the number of sailors to receive two NRMs is fantastically low, with all two-time recipients having had to serve a total of 20 years in the Naval Reserve between September 1938 and September 1958, e.g., before, during and after WW II. Therefore, most one-time recipients served in the USNR after WW II in the 1946-1958 window.

Like the larger movement, it promotes a revisionist interpretation of American history in which the federal government has turned against the ideas of liberty and natural rights expressed in the American Revolution. Ideology The movement originally referred to the late 1980s' Posse Comitatus group, a militant far-right organization. The Posse Comitatus followed an ideology based on the teachings of its founder William Potter Gale, who was also a Christian Identity minister, and the majority of the Christian Patriot movement's members still adhere to Christian Identity's white supremacist views. This ideology holds the view that state and federal governments are agents of an arcane conspiracy to deprive Americans of their rights as \\"sovereign citizens.\\" It also holds the view that this conspiracy can be undermined through various legal pleadings from English common law and other sources, such as a motion protesting the way a defendant's name is typeset in a legal complaint. The ideology persists despite numerous court rulings that have declared its theories frivolous. Status The movement grew during the 1990s after the Ruby Ridge and Waco Sieges appeared to confirm the suspicions of Christian Patriots.Anti-Defamation League, The Militia Movement The movement maintained its ties with the militia movement of the same period.

It is well known for featuring prominent athletes on its packages and has become a cultural icon in the United States. Originally introduced as Washburn‚Äôs Gold Medal Whole Wheat Flakes in 1924, it is primarily a wheat and bran mixture baked into flakes.  History  Glory Road on the UTEP campus, November 29, 2005. 1966 NCAA basketball championship team members Willie Worsley and Nevil Shedd, are pictured on the box, cutting down the hoop net. = Creation = Wheaties was created in 1921, as a result of an accidental spill of a wheat bran mixture onto a hot stove by a Minnesota clinician working for the Washburn Crosby Company (later General Mills). By November 1924, after more than 36 attempts to strengthen the flakes to withstand packaging, the process for creating the flakes had been perfected by the Washburn head miller, George Cormack, and the cereal was named Washburn's Gold Medal Whole Wheat Flakes. Soon after, the name was changed to Wheaties as a result of an employee contest won by Jane Bausman, the wife of a company export manager. Other names passed over included \\"Nutties\\" and \\"Gold Medal Wheat Flakes.\\" Wheaties began to be advertised on Minneapolis's WCCO radio station (owned by Washburn Crosby) on December 24, 1926, with the first-ever pre-recorded commercial jingle. Its lyrics were sung to the tune of the then-popular \\"She's a Jazz Baby\\" by Bill Holcombe and David Miller or possibly to the tune of \\"Jazz Baby\\": = Early sports association = Wheaties began its association with sports in 1927, through advertising on the southern wall of minor league baseball's Nicollet Park in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the contract, Wheaties sponsored the radio broadcasts of the minor league baseball team, Minneapolis Millers, on radio station WCCO and Wheaties was provided with a large billboard in the park to use to introduce new slogans. The first such slogan on the new signboard was penned by Knox Reeves, of a Minneapolis advertising agency. When asked what should be placed on the sign for Wheaties, Reeves sketched a Wheaties box on a pad of paper, thought for a moment, and wrote \\"Wheaties-The Breakfast of Champions\\". Throughout the 1930s, Wheaties increased in popularity with its sponsorship of baseball broadcasting, and by the end of the decade, nearly a hundred radio stations carried Wheaties sponsored events. During these events, athlete testimonials about Wheaties were used to demonstrate that Wheaties was indeed the breakfast of champions. In 1934, athletes began to be depicted on the Wheaties boxes, starting with baseball star Lou Gehrig, and the tradition continues today. The heyday of Wheaties came in the 1930s and early 1940s, as testimonials peaked from nearly every sport imaginable. Among the many testimonials included were: baseball stars, managers, and trainers; broadcasters; football stars and coaches; circus stars and rodeo; livestock breeders; a railroad engineer; horsemen and jockeys; a big-game hunter; automobile racers; an aviator; a speedboat driver; an explorer; and parachutists. Wheaties maintained brand recognition through its definitive association with sports, and its distinctive orange boxes. It became so popular that in the 1939 All-star game, 46 of the 51 players endorsed the cereal. In the months following, Wheaties became one of the sponsors of the very first televised sports broadcast to allow commercials. On August 29, 1939, NBC television presented the first major league baseball game ever televised between the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers to approximately 500 television set owners in New York City over experimental station W2XBS (now WNBC). Red Barber was the play-by-play broadcaster. Although full commercial television would not be authorized until July 1, 1941, the FCC allowed commercials to be inserted in this particular, special event broadcast as a test. Barber had to ad-lib three live commercials, one for each Dodger sponsor. For Procter & Gamble, he held up a bar of Ivory Soap. For Socony, Barber put on a Mobil gas station cap and raised a can of oil. For General Mills, he poured Wheaties into a bowl, added milk and sugar on top (some reports say he also sliced a banana), then proclaimed \\"Now that's the breakfast of champions.\\" \\"There was not a cue card in sight\\", Barber said. A measure of the product's familiarity is the reference in the 1941 baseball song Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, performed by Les Brown and his orchestra during DiMaggio's record hitting streak. In the song, DiMaggio gets a clutch base hit, and the band awards him \\"a case of Wheaties\\". = Tagline = * Eaties For My Wheaties * The Breakfast of Champions * You Better Eat Your Wheaties = Ties with Ronald Reagan = Wheaties radio broadcasting in the 1930s touched the early career of Ronald Reagan, who was at the time a sports broadcast announcer in Des Moines, Iowa. He was asked to create play-by-play recreations of Chicago Cubs baseball games using transcribed telegraph reports; his job performance in this role led to his selection in 1937 as the most popular Wheaties announcer in the nation. He was awarded an all-expenses- paid trip to the Cubs' spring training camp in California, and while there he took a Warner Bros. screen test. This led to his eventual film career; thus the Wheaties claim of perhaps leading Reagan into show business, and later politics as governor of California and 40th President of the United States. = Changes and children's promotions = Due to increasing costs in the 1940s of sponsorship of broadcasting, Wheaties began simple commercial sports testimonials on television or radio. These were less effective than the overall sponsorship (especially in the case of television), yet also greatly reduced costs for advertising of the product. In the early 1950s, General Mills redirected its promotional strategy for Wheaties to focus on children, following its great success in this market with its Cheerios brand. The strategy included sponsorship of The Lone Ranger and The Mickey Mouse Club, as well as the development of a mascot, a puppet character called Champy the Lion, produced by Bil Baird and voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft. Despite these efforts, sales of Wheaties declined dramatically, mainly due to adult consumers' dislike of so-called children's cereals. Children's consumption of Wheaties did in fact increase, but not enough to offset the decline in adult consumption. = Return of sports-related promotions = In 1958, General Mills decided to combat the decline in sales by returning Wheaties to its sporting roots. A three-pronged marketing strategy was devised. The first element was the selection of the brand's first spokesman, Bob Richards, two- time Olympic pole vault champion. The second was the reentry of Wheaties into the sports television sponsorship arena, pioneering the concepts of the pre- game and post-game show. The third was the creation of the Wheaties Sports Federation. The Wheaties Sports Federation promoted physical fitness, training, and participation in athletic events, through direct financial support of Olympic educational programs and the Jaycee Junior Champ track and field competition, and also through educational and instructional athletic films. From the 1960s through the 1990s, Wheaties provided in-box promotions but maintained a focus on athletic fitness and on-the-box sports figure promotions. Since the debut of the front cover depiction of Bob Richards, hundreds of athletes have been shown and promoted, including entire baseball, basketball, and football teams, while also highlighting Olympic successes (including regional Special Olympics editions). Wheaties also does not limit itself to current athletic stars, as special edition boxes have depicted baseball players from the early 20th century, and many athletes who were too early for Wheaties to cover (see Jim Thorpe). = Decline in sales = Recently, sales of Wheaties in the US has declined significantly. From 2005 to 2014 sales of Wheaties declined 78%.The most popular cereals in America today Washington Post. 18 March 2015. Retrieved 10 March 2019.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1987, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of William Davis and Frank Miller. Background Timbrell was born in Kingston, Ontario and educated at Woburn Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario and York University in Toronto. His brother Robert was an actor and performer, better known by the stage name Rusty Ryan. Timbrell worked as a teacher before entering provincial politics, and served as an alderman in North York from January 1970 until September 1, 1972. Provincial politics Timbrell contested 1971 provincial election as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and won election in the Toronto constituency of Don Mills. He was re-elected without difficulty in the campaigns of 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1985. =Cabinet= He became a minister without portfolio responsible for Youth in Davis's government on February 26, 1974, and was named as Minister of Energy on July 18, 1975. On February 3, 1977, he was promoted to Minister of Health. After serving in this high-profile position for five years, he became Ontario's Minister of Agriculture and Food on February 13, 1982. =First leadership campaign= Following Davis's resignation as PC leader and as premier, Timbrell sought the party leadership at the January 1985 leadership convention. He positioned himself as a centre-right candidate - further to the right of Red Tory rivals Larry Grossman and Roy McMurtry, but not as far to the right as Frank Miller - and therefore the candidate best able to continue Davis' pragmatic, successful style of government. (In fact, many media pundits at the time referred to Timbrell as a \\"clone\\" of Davis; playing to this, some of Timbrell's supporters at the January 1985 convention wore buttons that depicted a caricature which morphed the facial features of both Davis and Timbrell into one person). Timbrell was the only candidate to favour eliminating rent controls during the campaign. His supporters included Keith Norton, Leo Bernier, Margaret Birch, Robert Eaton, Gordon Dean, Bob Welch and Norm Sterling. Timbrell placed second on the first ballot, but was eliminated when he fell to third place on the second ballot, six votes behind Grossman who had the backing of McMurtry's campaign. Dr. John Balkwill in 1987 claimed that 30 to 40 Miller supporters were instructed by the Miller campaign to vote for Grossman on the second ballot to prevent him from advancing. Lou Parsons, a senior Miller adviser, later acknowledged, \\"We wouldn't have won it against Dennis [...] Our winning strategy was always to be against Larry ... and in the end we were lucky.\\"Rosemary Speirs. 1986. Out of the blue: the fall of the Tory dynasty in Ontario. Toronto: Macmillan of Canada. p. 81. Timbrell reluctantly endorsed Grossman after the results were confirmed by a recount. He however did not bring enough delegates on the third ballot and that resulted in Miller's victory. He was retained in Miller's cabinet as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing with responsibility for Women's Issues. =Second leadership campaign= The Progressive Conservative Party under Miller's leadership was reduced to a narrow minority government in the 1985 election. Following a cabinet shuffle on May 17, 1985, Timbrell retained his previous postings and was additionally appointed Provincial Secretary for Resource Development. Miller's government was defeated in the House in June, 1985. In opposition, Timbrell served as House Leader of the Official Opposition and his party's critic for Education and Women's Issues. Miller resigned as leader, and the party called another leadership convention for November 1985. This contest was an extremely divisive struggle between Timbrell and Grossman, which exposed deep divisions in the party. A third candidate, Alan Pope, drew attention to the animosity between the candidates with his slogan, \\"Don't choose sides, choose Pope\\". Alan Eagleson was a co- chairman of Timbrell's campaign. In this leadership race, Timbrell announced he would not support the full funding of Catholic schools (which had previously been agreed to by all parties in the legislature) unless amendments were put forward guaranteeing entry to non-Catholic teachers and students. Norm Sterling, an inveterate opponent of Catholic school funding, derided Timbrell's position as opportunistic and crossed over to Grossman. Timbrell's change of position may have turned away other potential supporters as well. Pope finished third on the opening ballot and some believed that he could have given Timbrell a second-ballot victory over Grossman, though Pope chose not to endorse either side. Grossman defeated Timbrell on the second ballot by nineteen votes, effectively ending Timbrell's career in provincial politics. He did not seek re-election in 1987. Private sector career Timbrell served as president of the Ontario Hospital Association from 1991 to 1995. He also served as a Director of the St. Joseph's Health System (Sisters of St. Joseph, Morrow Park) from 1986 to 1988 and a Director of the Toronto School of Theology (U of T) from 1986 to 1992 and in 1997‚Äì2003 (Vice-Chairman from 1991 to 1993 and in 1997‚Äì2000, Chairman from 2000 to 2003). He has served as a Director of various corporations, including Cabot Trust, Confederation Leasing, Confederation Trust, Ontario Blue Cross, United Telemanagement (Canada) Corporation and Eco Power Solutions Inc. Federal politics In 1997 and again in 2000 Timbrell campaigned for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as the federal Progressive Conservative candidate in the eastern Ontario riding of Prince Edward‚ÄîHastings In the 1997 federal election, Timbrell placed second to Liberal Lyle Vanclief, with 21.5% of the vote. In the 2000 election, Timbrell placed third with 20.3% of the vote. Recognition In 2006, Toronto City Council voted to name the community recreation - library - aquatic - child care facility, located at 29 St. Dennis Drive, Don Mills the \\"Dennis R. Timbrell Resource Centre in Flemingdon Park\\". Timbrell has received the following forms of recognition: 1977 - The Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal 1978 - Officer of The Order of St. John of Jerusalem 1992 - The Canada Confederation 125 Medal 1993 - Knight of Malta 2012 - The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal References  External links  * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:People from Kingston, Ontario Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidates for the Canadian House of Commons Category:Candidates in the 1997 Canadian federal election Category:Candidates in the 2000 Canadian federal election ","title":"Dennis Timbrell"},{"id":"890786","text":"Minor Martin White (July 9, 1908 ‚Äì June 24, 1976) was an American photographer, theoretician, critic, and educator. He combined an intense interest in how people viewed and understood photographs with a personal vision that was guided by a variety of spiritual and intellectual philosophies. Starting in Oregon in 1937 and continuing until he died in 1976, White made thousands of black-and-white and color photographs of landscapes, people, and abstract subject matter, created with both technical mastery and a strong visual sense of light and shadow. He taught many classes, workshops, and retreats on photography at the California School of Fine Arts, Rochester Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, other schools, and in his own home. He lived much of his life as a closeted gay man, afraid to express himself publicly for fear of loss of his teaching jobs, and some of his most compelling images are figure studies of men whom he taught or with whom he had relationships. He helped start, and for many years was editor of, the photography magazine Aperture. After his death in 1976, White was hailed as one of America's greatest photographers. Biography =Early life: 1908‚Äì1937= White was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the only child of Charles Henry White, a bookkeeper, and Florence May White, a dressmaker. His first name came from his great, great grandfather from the White family side, and his middle name was his mother's maiden name. During his early years, he spent much of his time with his grandparents. His grandfather, George Martin, was an amateur photographer and gave White his first camera in 1915. As a child, White enjoyed playing in the large garden at his grandparents' home, and this influenced his decision later on to study botany in college.Hall, 19‚Äì20 White's parents went through a series of separations starting in 1916, and during those periods White lived with his mother and her parents. His parents reconciled for a while in 1922 and remained together until they divorced in 1929.Bunnell, 1 By the time White graduated from high school he was already aware of his latent homosexuality. In 1927 he wrote about his feelings for men in his diary, and to his dismay his parents read his diary without his permission. After what he called a brief crisis period, during which he left home for the summer, he returned to live with his family while he started college. His parents never spoke of his homosexuality again. White entered the University of Minnesota in 1927 and majored in botany. By the time he should have graduated in 1931 he had not met the requirements for a science degree, and he left the university for a while. During this period he became very interested in writing, and he started a personal journal that he called \\"Memorable Fancies.\\" In it he wrote poems, intimate thoughts about his life and his struggles with his sexuality, excerpts from letters that he wrote to others, occasional diary-like entries about his daily life, and, later on, extensive notes about his photography. He continued to fill the pages of his journal until he directed most of his energy into teaching around 1970.Bunnell, 2 In 1932 White re-entered the university and studied both writing and botany. With his previous credits, he was able to graduate in 1934. The next year he took some graduate classes in botany, but after six months he decided that he lacked real interest in becoming a scientist. He spent the next two years doing odd jobs and exploring his writing skills. During this period he began creating a set of 100 sonnets on the theme of sexual love, his first attempt at grouping his creative output.Hall, 134 =Launching a career:1937‚Äì1945= In late 1937 White decided to move to Seattle. He purchased a 35mm Argus camera and took a bus trip across country toward his destination. He stopped in Portland, Oregon, on his way and decided to stay there. For the next 2-1/2 years he lived at the YMCA in Portland while he explored photography in depth for the first time. It was at the YMCA that he taught his first class in photography, to a small group of young adults. He also joined the Oregon Camera Club to learn about how photographers talk about their own images and what photography means to them.White 1969, 233 White was offered a job in 1938 as photographer for the Oregon Art Project, which was funded by the Works Progress Administration. One of his tasks was to photograph historic buildings in downtown Portland before they were demolished for a new riverfront development. At this same time he made publicity photos for the Portland Civic Theater, documenting their plays and taking portraits of the actors and actresses.White 1969, 234 In 1940 White was hired to teach photography at the La Grande Art Center in eastern Oregon. He quickly became immersed in his work and taught classes three days a week, lectured on art of local students, reviewed exhibitions for the local newspaper and delivered a weekly radio broadcast about activities at the Art Center. In his spare time he traveled throughout the region, taking photographs of the landscape, farms and small town buildings. He also wrote his first article on photography, \\"When is Photography Creative?,\\" which was published in American Photography magazine two years later. White resigned from the Art Center in late 1941 and returned to Portland where he intended to start a commercial photography business. That year three of his photographs were accepted by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for inclusion in their \\"Image of Freedom\\" exhibition. At the close of the exhibition the museum purchased all three prints, the first time his images entered a public collection. The following year the Portland Art Museum gave White his first one-man show, exhibiting four series of photos he made while in eastern Oregon. He wrote in his journal that with that show \\"a period came to a close.\\"Hall, 21 In April 1942 White was drafted into the United States Army and hid his homosexuality from the recruiters. Before leaving Portland he left most of his negatives of historic Portland buildings with the Oregon Historical Society. White spent the first two years of World War II in Hawaii and in Australia, and later he became Chief of the Divisional Intelligence Branch in the southern Philippines. During this period he rarely photographed, choosing instead to write poetry and extended verse. Three of his longer poems, \\"Elegies,\\" \\"Free Verse for the Freedom of Speech,\\" and \\"Minor Testament,\\" spoke to his experiences during the war and to the bonds of men under extreme conditions. Later he would use some of the text from \\"Minor Testament\\" in his photographic sequence Amputations. After the war White traveled to New York City and enrolled in Columbia University. While in New York he met and became close friends with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, who were working in the newly formed photography department at the Museum of Modern Art. White was offered a job as photographer for the museum and spent many hours talking with and learning from Nancy Newhall, who he said strongly influenced his thinking about and his direction in photography.Bunnell, 4 =Mid-career: 1946‚Äì1964= In February 1946 White had the first of several meetings with photographer Alfred Stieglitz in New York. White knew of Stieglitz's deep understanding of photography from his various writings, and through their conversations White adopted much of Stieglitz's theory of equivalence, where the image stands for something other than the subject matter, and his use of sequencing pictorial imagery. At one of their meetings White wrote in his journal that he expressed his doubt that he was ready to become a serious photographer. He wrote that Stieglitz asked him \\"Have you ever been in love?\\" White answered \\"yes,\\" and Stieglitz replied \\"Then you can photograph.\\"Hall, 16 During this time, White met and became friends with some of the major photographers of the time, including Berenice Abbott, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Edward Weston, and Harry Callahan. Steichen, who was director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, offered White a curatorial position at the museum, but instead White accepted an offer from Ansel Adams to assist him at the newly created photography department at the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) in San Francisco.Comer, 20‚Äì24 White moved to San Francisco in July and lived in the same house as Adams for several years. While there Adams taught White about his Zone System method of exposing and developing negatives, which White used extensively in his own work. He wrote extensively about it, published a book and taught the exposure and development method as well as the practice of (pre)-visualization to his students. While in San Francisco White became close friends with Edward Weston in Carmel, and for the remainder of his life Weston had a profound influence on White's photography and philosophy. Later he said \\"...Stieglitz, Weston and Ansel all gave me exactly what I needed at that time. I took one thing from each: technique from Ansel, the love of nature from Weston, and from Stieglitz the affirmation that I was alive and I could photograph.\\"Hill Jan 1977, 40 Over the next several years White spent a great deal of time photographing at Point Lobos, the site of some of Weston's most famous images, approaching many of the same subjects with entirely different viewpoints and creative purposes. By mid-1947 White was the primary teacher at CSFA and had developed a three- year course that emphasized personal expressive photography. Over the next six years he brought in as teachers some of the best photographers of the time, including Imogen Cunningham, Lisette Model, and Dorothea Lange.Comer, 28‚Äì30 During this time White created his first grouping of photos and text in a non- narrative form, a sequence he called Amputations. Although it was scheduled to be shown at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, the exhibition was canceled because White refused to allow the photographs to be shown without text, which included some wording that expressed his ambiguity about America's post-war patriotism.Bunnell, 6 From The Temptation of St. Anthony Is Mirrors (1948) The next three years were some of White's most prolific in terms of creative output. In addition to taking dozens of land- and waterscapes, he made dozens of photographs that evolved into some of his most compelling sequences. Three in particular showed his continuing struggles with his sexuality. Song Without Words, The Temptation of St. Anthony Is Mirrors, and Fifth Sequence/Portrait of a Young Man as Actor all depict \\"the emotional turmoil he feels over his love and desire for men.\\" In 1949 White purchased a small Zeiss Ikonta camera and began a series of urban street photographs. Over the next four years he took nearly 6,000 images, all inspired by his newfound interest in the poetry of Walt Whitman. The project, which he called City of Surf, included photographs of San Francisco's Chinatown, the docks, people on the streets and various parades and fairs around town. The period of 1951‚Äì52 is one of the formative times in White's career. He participated in a Conference on Photography at the Aspen Institute, where the idea of creating a new journal of photography was discussed by Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Frederick Sommer and others. Soon after Aperture magazine was founded by many of these same individuals. White volunteered for and was approved as editor, and the first issue appeared in April 1952. Aperture quickly became one of the most influential magazines about photography, and White remained as editor until 1975.Hill Feb 1977, 37 Near the end of 1952 White's father, from whom he had been estranged for many years, died in Long Beach, California. In 1953 Walter Chappell introduced White to the I Ching, an ancient Chinese book of philosophy and divination, and White continued to be influenced by and refer to this text throughout the rest of his life. He was especially intrigued by the concepts of yin and yang, in which apparently opposite or contrary forces may be conceived as complementary. Later that same year a reorganization at CSFS resulted in White's teaching role being cut back, and as a result he began to think about a change in his employment. Concurrently, Beaumont Newhall had recently become the curator at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, and Newhall invited White to work with him there as a curatorial assistant. He exhibited September 28 ‚Äì November 3, 1954 at Limelight Gallery in New York and was included in that gallery's Great Photographs at the end of that year. Over the next three years White organized three themed exhibitions that demonstrated his particular interests: Camera Consciousness, The Pictorial Image and Lyrical and Accurate. In 1955 he joined the faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where he taught one day a week. White's photographic output declined during this time due to his teaching and editorial work, but he continued to produce enough images that by the end of 1955 he had created a new sequence, Sequence 10/Rural Cathedrals, which included landscape images from upstate New York that were shot on regular and infrared film. By 1955 White was fully engaged in teaching, having been appointed as instructor at the new four-year photography program at RIT as well as conducting classes and workshops at Ohio University and Indiana University. Walter Chappell moved to Rochester later in the year to work at the George Eastman House. Chappell engaged White in long discussions about various Eastern religions and philosophies. White began practicing Zen meditation and adopted a Japanese style of decoration in his house. Over the next two years the discussions between White and Chappell metamorphosed into lengthy discourses about the writing and philosophy of George Gurdjieff. White gradually became an adherent of Gurdjieff's teachings and started to incorporate Gurdjieff's thinking into the design and implementation of his workshops.Gassan, 108‚Äì114 Gurdjieff's concepts, for White, were not just intellectual exercises but guides to experience, and they greatly influenced much of his approach to teaching and photography throughout the rest of his life.Hall, 40 During this same period White began making his first color images. Although he is better known for his black-and-white photography, he produced many color photographs. His archive contains nearly 9,000 35mm transparencies taken between 1955 and 1975.Bunnell, 47 In 1959 White mounted a large exhibition of 115 photos of his Sequence 13/Return to the Bud at the George Eastman House. It was his largest exhibition to date. It later traveled to the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. White was invited to teach a 10-days', all-expense-paid workshop in Portland to accompany the exhibition. He took advantage of the funding to photograph landscapes and did nature studies across the country. From his experience in Portland he developed the idea for a full-time residential workshop in Rochester in which students would learn through both formal sessions and, following a combination of thinking from Gurdjieff and from Zen, through an understanding gained by the discipline of such tasks as household chores and early morning workouts. He would continue this style of residential teaching until he died.Bunnell, 9 In the early 1960s White also studied hypnosis and incorporated the practice into some of his teachings as a way of helping students experience photographs.Hill Feb 1977, 39 White continued to teach extensively both privately and at RIT for the next several years. During this time he traveled across the U.S. in the summers taking photographs along the way. In his journal he referred to himself during this period as \\"The Wanderer,\\" which had both literal and metaphorical meanings due to his search for understanding life. In 1962 he met Michael Hoffman, who became a friend, colleague and, later, assumed the editorship of Aperture magazine. White later named Hoffman to be the executor of his will.Bunnell, p10 =Late career: 1965‚Äì1974= In 1965 White was invited to help design a newly formed program in visual arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston. After being appointed as a Visiting Professor, White moved to the Boston area and purchased a 12-room house in suburban Arlington so he could increase the size of his residential workshops for selected students. Soon after moving to the Boston area, he completed a different kind of sequence called Slow Dance, which he would later integrate into his teachings. He continued to explore how people understand and interpret photography and began to incorporate techniques of Gestalt psychology into his teachings. To help his students experience the meaning of \\"equivalence,\\" he started requiring them to draw certain subjects as well as photograph them. White began to experience periodic discomfort in his chest in 1966, and his doctor diagnosed his ailment as angina. His symptoms continued throughout the rest of his life, leading him to intensify his study of spiritual matters and meditation. He turned to astrology in an attempt to increase his understanding about life, and his interest in it became so significant that he required all of his current and prospective students to have their horoscopes completed.Bunnell, 11 By this point in his life White's unorthodox teaching methods were well established, and students who went through his workshops were both mystified and enlightened by the experience. One student who later became a Zen monk said \\"I really wanted to learn to see the way he did, to capture my subjects in a way that didn't render them lifeless and two-dimensional. I didn't realize that Minor was teaching us exactly that: not only to see images, but to feel them, smell them, taste them. He was teaching us how to be photography.\\"Daido Loori White began writing the text for Mirrors, Messages, Manifestations, which was the first monograph of his photographs, in late 1966, and three years later the book was published by Aperture. It included 243 of his photographs and text, including poems, notes from his journal and other writings. Peter Bunnell, who was one of White's early students and then Curator of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, wrote a lengthy biography of White for the book. During this same time White completed Sequence 1968, a series of landscape images from his recent travels.Hall, 136 During the next several years White conceived of and directed four major themed photography exhibitions at MIT, starting with \\"Light7\\" in 1968 and followed by \\"Be-ing without Clothes\\" in 1970White, 1970., \\"Octave of Prayer\\" in 1972 and \\"Celebrations\\" in 1974. Anyone could submit images for the shows, and White spent a great deal of time personally reviewing all of the submissions and selecting the final images.Bunnell, 12‚Äì13 White continued to teach extensively and make his own photographs even though his health was declining. He devoted more and more time to his writing and began a long text he called \\"Consciousness in Photography and the Creative Audience,\\" in which he referred to his 1965 sequence Slow Dance and advanced the idea that certain states of heightened awareness were necessary to truly read a photograph and understand its meaning. To complete this work he applied for and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1970, and Consciousness in Photography and the Creative Audience became required reading for a new course he taught at MIT called \\"Creative Audience.\\" in 1971 he traveled to Puerto Rico to explore more of his color photography, and in 1974 and 1975 he journeyed to Peru to teach and to further his own Gurdjieff studies. In 1975 White traveled to England to lecture at the Victoria and Albert Museum and to teach classes at various colleges. He continued on a hectic travel schedule for several weeks, then flew directly to the University of Arizona in Tucson to take part in a symposium there. When he returned to Boston after nearly six weeks of travel, he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for several weeks. After this White's focus turned even more inward, and he photographed very little. He spent much of his time with his student Abe Frajndlich, who made a series of situational portraits of White around his home and in his garden.Frajndlich, 12‚Äì16 A few months before his death White published a short article in Parabola magazine called \\"The Diamond Lens of Fable\\" in which he associated himself with Gilgamesh, Jason and King Arthur, all heroes of old tales about lifelong quests. On June 24, 1976, White died of a second heart attack while working at his home. He bequeathed all of his personal archives and papers, along with a large collection of his photographs, to Princeton University. He left his house to Aperture so they could continue the work he started there.Hall, 39 Equivalence White was greatly influenced by Stieglitz's concept of \\"equivalence,\\" which White interpreted as allowing photographs to represent more than their subject matter. He wrote \\"when a photograph functions as an Equivalent, the photograph is at once a record of something in front of the camera and simultaneously a spontaneous symbol. (A 'spontaneous symbol' is one which develops automatically to fill the need of the moment. A photograph of the bark of a tree, for example, may suddenly touch off a corresponding feeling of roughness of character within an individual.)\\"White 1963, 17 In his later life he often made photographs of rocks, surf, wood and other natural objects that were isolated from their context, so that they became abstract forms. He intended these to be interpreted by the viewer as something more than what they actually present. According to White, \\"When a photographer presents us with what to him is an Equivalent, he is telling us in effect, 'I had a feeling about something and here is my metaphor of that feeling.'...What really happened is that he recognized an object or series of forms that, when photographed, would yield an image with specific suggestive powers that can direct the viewer into a specific and known feeling, state, or place within himself.\\" In the introduction to his Fourth Sequence (1950), White wrote: > While rocks were photographed, the subject of the sequence is not rocks; > while symbols seem to appear, they are barely pointers to significance. The > meaning appears in the mood they raise in the beholder; and the flow of the > sequence eddies in the river of his associations as he passes from picture > to picture. The rocks are only the objects upon which the significance is > spread like sheets on the ground to dry. Not everyone agreed with or understood White's philosophy. Some of White's abstract images \\"have an indeterminacy that forestalls any conventional response.\\"Grunberg One critic wrote \\"Without a capacity to see in rocks some glimmer of essential form, as Weston did, or in clouds some hint of a universal life force, as Stieglitz did, one cannot understand White's pictures....One gets the impression that White did not develop as an artist in a linear sense so much as he oscillated between conflicting poles.\\" Sequences In the mid-1940s White began to articulate a philosophy about the importance of how his photographs are presented to the viewer. He was influenced initially by Stieglitz, who in his teaching emphasized that photographs shown in a structured content may support each other and may create a total statement that is more complex and meaningful that the individual images by themselves. When White began working as a photographer at the Museum of Modern Art in 1945 he became friends with Nancy Newhall, who was organizing a retrospective of Edward Weston's photographs for the museum. Newhall had a gift for creating highly distinct groupings of images, and White said later that her installation of the Weston exhibit was a revelation to him.Bunnell, 231 For the rest of his life he spent a great deal of time grouping and regrouping his photographs into specific sets of images that varied in number from 10 to more than 100 prints. He described what he called a sequence as a \\"cinema of stills\\" that he felt would impart a \\"feeling-state\\" created by both the photographer and the personality of the individual viewer. In his early sequences (through 1952) he included various poems and other texts with his images. As he evolved his thinking about sequences, he gradually stopped using texts. At the same time many of his images became more and more abstract. Although he felt strongly about the particular groupings of his images, in his early sequences he purposely did not prescribe a specific order for how they should be presented. He said he wanted his sequences to be subjective interpretations, and as such he wanted viewers to gain insights into themselves by allowing them to contemplate his work as they saw fit.Bunnell, 31 This concept was limited to those viewers who were part of his workshops and teachings, where they could handle the prints individually rather than see them in a gallery. Two iterations of Power Spot (1970). White flipped the negative vertically between the first and the second version. Later, as he became more interested in anthropology and myth, he began to experiment with how individual images influenced a viewer by how they were presented. In a work he called Totemic Sequence, composed of 10 photographs, he included the same image as both the opening and the closing picture. The last picture is the first picture turned upside down. White felt that this change illustrated the simultaneous reality and unreality in a photograph. The title he gave to the first image was \\"Power Spot.\\"Bunnell, 232 White wrote extensively about his thought about sequences, both in his journal and in articles. In his journal he wrote \\"The photographs in a Sequence or Constellation may be compared to a dance or theme. The major points of the whole are stated and restated with variations until the very last member of the audience has encountered it or them.\\" He also wrote \\"Sequence now means that the joy of photographing in the light of the sun is balanced by the joy of editing in the light of the mind.\\"both quotes: Bunnell, 39 During his lifetime White created or planned about 100 groups of his photographs, including sequences (with multiple versions), series and portfolios.Bunnell, 233 Many were named simply \\"Sequence\\" followed by a number, but for several he added artistic titles that reflected his ideas that photographs represent more than their obvious subject matter. Some of his major sequences are: *Song Without Words (1947) *Second Sequence: Amputations (1947) *The Temptation of St. Anthony Is Mirrors (1948). This sequence is White's most personal body of work, composed entirely of photos of a model at CSFA named Tom Murphy. The 32 images include intimate portraits and figure studies, many of which showed Murphy's frontal full-nude body. At the time it was illegal to either exhibit or publish images that explicitly showed male genitals, and if White would have let it be known that he had taken the photographs he would have been exposed as a homosexual and subjected to harassment and loss of his job. He mounted and bound two copies of the photos into small, hand-made books, gave one to Murphy and kept the other copy for himself. Many of the photos in this sequence were never published during his lifetime, and the complete sequence was exhibited for the first time only in 2014 at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.Martineau, 8 *Sequence 11 / The Young Man as Mystic (1955) *Sequence 13 / Return to the Bud (1959) *Sequence 16 / The Sound of One Hand (1960) *Sequence 17 / Out of My love for You I Will Try to Give You Back Yourself (1963) *Slow Dance (1965). White stepped outside of his usual methods in creating this sequence, which consists of 80 color slides intended to be seen on dual projectors. It was inspired by his interest in movement as interpreted through Gurdjieff's \\"rhythmic rituals.\\" *Totemic Sequence (1974) Quotations *\\"At first glance a photograph can inform us. At second glance it can reach us.\\"Comer, 96 *\\"Be still with yourself until the object of your attention affirms your presence.\\"Caponigro *\\"Camera and I have gotten into some eye pursuit of intensified consciousness.\\"White 1963, 182 *\\"Equivalency functions on the assumption that the following equation is factual: Photograph + Person Looking Mental Image.\\"White 1963, 19 *\\"In becoming a photographer I am only changing medium.

With over 100 film scores and 300 television scores to his credit, he became known as the \\"Grandfather of Film Music.\\"OBITUARY: David Raksin, 92, Grandfather of Film Music Published: August 11, 2004 Biography Trailer for Laura David Raksin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1912, to Jewish parents (of Russian heritage). His father was an orchestra conductor. Raksin played professionally in dance bands while attending Central High School of Philadelphia. He went on to study composition with Harl McDonald at the University of Pennsylvania and later with Isadore Freed in New York and Arnold Schoenberg in Los Angeles. In New York Raksin worked as an arranger for Harms/Chappell. One of his earliest film assignments was as assistant to Charlie Chaplin in the composition of the score to Modern Times (1936). He is perhaps best remembered for his score for the film Laura (1944). The theme music for the film, \\"Laura\\", with the addition of lyrics by Johnny Mercer, became a major hit. During Raksin's lifetime, \\"Laura\\" was said to be the second most-recorded song in history following \\"Stardust\\" by Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish. Raksin's theme song \\"The Bad and the Beautiful\\" (also called \\"Love is For the Very Young\\") for the 1953 film The Bad and the Beautiful (1953) was also a hit, although not as popular as \\"Laura\\". Raksin insisted that the song be released as an instrumental because he had resented having to split the proceeds from \\"Laura\\" with a lyricist. Raksin's theme for \\"The Bad and the Beautiful\\" was initially disliked by the film's director Vincente Minnelli and producer John Houseman, but was saved from rejection by the intervention of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, who both liked it. The theme has since been praised by Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Rosenman, Richard Rodney Bennett, and Alexander Courage. Sondheim reportedly called it \\"one of the best themes ever written in films\\". Raksin also scored the 1958 film Separate Tables, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. In the 1960s, Raksin wrote the theme song for (and scored the pilot of) the medical drama television series Ben Casey. Later in life, Raksin taught at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles. Raksin died in 2004, aged 92. At the time of his death, it was announced that Raksin had completed his autobiography, titled If I Say So Myself. . The book was eventually published under the title The Bad and the Beautiful: My Life in a Golden Age of Film Music. In 2012, he was named for a Lifetime Achievement Award for a Past Film Composer.

E. P. Dutton) Little Me: The Intimate Memoirs of that Great Star of Stage, Screen and Television, or simply Little Me, was the parody \\"confessional\\" self-indulgent autobiography of \\"Belle Poitrine\\" (French for \\"Pretty Bosom\\"). It was written by Patrick Dennis, who had achieved a great success with Auntie Mame. A bestseller when introduced in book form, the work was also later staged on Broadway as a musical. The heavily illustrated work featured numerous photographs by Cris Alexander, who combined retouched stock photographs with original photographs taken to create Belle Poitrine's life. Published in 1961, it was considered pretty risqu√© at the time. (Several of Alexander's photographs were rejected by censors.) The book also featured family and friends of Dennis and Alexander, including Dennis' wife, Louise, as \\"Pixie Portnoy\\", and ballet dancer Shaun O'Brien (Alexander's domestic partner) as Mr. Musgrove. Actress Dodie Goodman and comedian Alice Pearce were prominently featured. Actress Jeri Archer portrayed the often overexposed, self-centered and clueless Poitrine, and Kurt Bieber was her beefcake co-star and paramour, \\"Letch Feely\\". Little Me was reissued in 2002 with a new preface by Charles Busch and foreword by Alexander. The plot of Little Me tells the rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches, etc. story of Maybelle Schlumpfert, an overdeveloped and self-deluded young girl who rises to become Belle Poitrine.An example of her delusions: Belle is born in 1900 and the book is structured a chapter per decade, but chapter six is titled \\"Frankly Forty\\". Throughout the book, Poitrine's character trumpets her successes (which are few) while glossing over her failures (which are many). The book was a stinging parody of the cult of celebrity and self-importance stemming from the numerous \\"personality overcoming obstacles\\" biographies of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Little Me, the musical Little Me was made into a musical, with book by Neil Simon, music by Cy Coleman, and lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, which opened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 17, 1962 and ran for 257 performances.

He played for three teams: the Indianapolis Blues of the National League (NL) for one season, the Chicago White Stockings (NL) for 11 seasons, and the Chicago Pirates of the Players' League for one season. From 1883 and 1887, Williamson held the single-season record for both doubles and home runs. Although his record for doubles was surpassed in 1887, he held the home run record until 1919, when it was topped by Babe Ruth of the Boston Red Sox. Statistically, he was one of the best fielders of his era. During the first eight years of his career, he led the league at his position in both fielding percentage and double plays five times, and he also led his position in assists six times. Later, when he moved to shortstop, he again led the league in both assists and double plays. His career was shortened by a knee injury that he suffered in Paris during a world-tour organized by Albert Spalding. After he left organized baseball, his health declined rapidly. He contracted tuberculosis and ultimately died at the age of 36 of dropsy. Career Born in Philadelphia, Williamson began his major league career on May 1, 1878 for the Indianapolis Blues of the National League. That season he played in all 63 of the team's games as the starting third baseman, leading the league in that category. He umpired his only game on August 12, calling a game between the Chicago White Stockings and the Providence Grays. His season-ending statistics included a .232 batting average, one home run, and 31 runs scored. The Blues were only a major league team for the 1878 season, resulting in Williamson joining the Chicago White Stockings for the 1879 season. He was their regular third baseman, leading the league in multiple fielding categories for his position, including fielding percentage, assists, putouts, and double plays. As a hitter, his numbers improved. He finished second in the league with 13 triples, and eighth in doubles with 20, while also raising his batting average to .294. During the next three seasons, his batting statistics fluctuated from year to year. His batting average rose from .251 in 1880 to .282 in 1882; likewise, his 20 doubles in 1880 were good for seventh in the league, but dropped to 12 in 1881. He followed that season with 27 in 1882, which was fourth in the league. During this time period, when his level of hitting had dropped, his play in the field did not. He led the league in fielding percentage from 1880 to 1882, and in assists in 1881 and 1882. In 1883, Williamson set the major league record for doubles in a single season by hitting 49, surpassing King Kelly's 37 set the previous year. Williamson's record for doubles stood until Tip O'Neill of the St. Louis Browns hit 52 in 1887. Williamson's doubles achievement was attributed to the short dimensions of Chicago's Lakeshore Park; the distances were in left field, in center field, and in right field. Balls that were hit over the fence were counted as doubles until 1884, when they became home runs. On September 6, Chicago scored a record 18 runs in one inning during a 26-6 victory over the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson contributed three hits, and scored three runs in that inning, setting individual records in both categories. Other than runs scored, the other team records set that day included the most hits and total bases in one inning. During this time period, the establishment of the ground rules of each park rested with the home team. In 1884, team captain and on-field manager Cap Anson decided that balls hit over the fence were to be home runs. Williamson used these short dimensions and new ground rules to set the single-season home run record by hitting 27 in a 112-game season, surpassing the record of 14 set by Harry Stovey the previous year. Of the 27 home runs he hit that year, 25 of them were hit at home. This record stood for 35 years until it was broken in 1919 by Babe Ruth, who hit 29 for the Boston Red Sox in a 140-game schedule. The first three of Williamson's 27 home runs came on May 30, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson became the first major league baseball player to hit three home runs in one game. During these two record-breaking seasons, his fielding prowess did not recede. He did not lead the league in fielding percentage in either 1883 or 1884, but did lead in assists, capping off a streak of five consecutive years in which he did so, while also leading the league in double plays for the second and third consecutive years. After the 1884 season, the White Stockings moved to West Side Park, and Williamson's power numbers dropped. Without the short fences, his home run total dropped to three, his doubles went down to 16, and his batting average dropped to .238, his lowest average since he became a White Stocking. Despite his low hitting numbers, he did lead the league in games played with 116, bases on balls with 75, and yet again, led his position in assists, double plays, and for the fifth and last time, fielding percentage. Chicago won the National League championship that season, and agreed to play the American Association champions, the St. Louis Browns in a seven-game \\"World Series\\". Before game one began, the players of both teams held a field day which included contests of skill, and Williamson won the long throw with a toss that traveled 400 feet, four inches. The 1885 series ended in a tie when each team won three games, and one game ended in a tie. Williamson collected two base hits in 23 at bats, for a .087 batting average, and scored one run. Beginning in 1886, Williamson switched his fielding position to shortstop, while the Chicago White Stockings again won the National League championship, their fifth in seven years. The team's success did not coincide with Williamson's slide in seasonal numbers. His batting average dropped to his career low of .216, and his strikeouts jumped up to a career high of 71, in 430 at bats, although he did finish third in bases on balls. The White Stockings met the St. Louis Browns following the season and agreed to play a best of seven \\"World Series\\" for the second consecutive year. The Browns won the series, four games to two, and Williamson's statistics for the series did not improve. In fact, they were worse than in 1885. He gathered one base hit in 18 at bats, for a .056 batting average, and scored two runs. 1887 was Williamson's second season at shortstop, his last full season in the majors, and his numbers began to climb back to what they were during the early part of his career. His batting average jumped back up to .267, hit 20 doubles, 14 triples, 73 base on balls, and nine home runs. In 1888, his batting average dipped again, this time to .250, but he did finish fourth in the league in both RBIs with 73, and base on balls with 65. In the field, he led the league in assists and double plays. Spalding's world tour At the completion of the 1888 baseball season, Albert Spalding organized an around-the-world tour to promote the game of baseball. The two teams Spalding selected were the White Stockings and a collection of players from other National League teams. The tour departed on October 20, 1888 to play exhibition games throughout the western United States for a month, before departing to Hawaii. The tour visited several foreign countries, such as Australia, Egypt, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), France, Italy, and England. It was during a game played on at the Parc Aristotique in Paris, France on March 8, 1889, when Williamson suffered a torn knee cap which forced him to be bedridden in England on doctor's orders, missing the tour through Britain. Though players in the 19th century were responsible for their own medical care, Williamson asked Spalding to help him financially with the mounting medical costs. Spalding refused, citing that he was not obligated to assist, and Williamson never forgave him for this. Williamson, among his baseball contemporaries, wrote the most colorful articles to newspapers as the tour was unfolding. Williamson, an 1880s teammate of Anson in Chicago, had a knack for roasting‚Äîpoking fun at‚Äîhis teammates while always coming across as good-natured. A testament to the letters' significance is that they are a dominant source of one recent book's World Tour presentation., pp. 168‚Äì171, 178‚Äì180, 182‚Äì186, 188. Besides having Williamson World Tour letter content on 13 pages of its 34 pages devoted to the tour, Cap Anson 4 also contains a 12-page biography of Williamson, focusing on his personality, including his letter-writing talents at other times. Williamson is portrayed by Charlie Crabtree in the 2015 movie \\"Deadball\\" which depicts his life and journaling of the world tour.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4531902/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3 Late career and death The injury to Williamson's knee caused his career to suffer, as he played in 47 games during the 1889 season. He batted .237, and of his 41 hits that season, only five of them were extra base hits. He joined the Chicago Pirates of the Players' League for the 1890 season, his final major league season, and played in 73 games, hitting .195. In the spring of 1894, Williamson traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, in hopes that he could recover from a liver ailment and lose some weight as well, but the treatments did not work. Williamson died on March 3 of that year, at the age of 36 in Willow Springs, Arkansas, of dropsy (edema) complicated by consumption (tuberculosis). He is interred in an unmarked grave at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

It was a response to concerns about the safety of new food additives. The amendment established an exemption from the \\"food additive\\" definition and requirements for substances \\"generally recognized as safe\\" by scientific experts in the field, based on long history of use before 1958 or based on scientific studies. New food additives would be subject to testing including by the \\"Delaney clause\\". The Delaney clause was a provision in the amendment which said that if a substance were found to cause cancer in man or animal, then it could not be used as a food additive. \\"Generally recognized as safe\\" Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts, and so is exempted from the usual Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) food additive tolerance requirements. The concept of food additives being \\"generally recognized as safe\\" was first described in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards. Delaney Clause The Delaney Clause is a provision in the amendment named after Congressman James Delaney of New York. It said: > the Secretary of the Food and Drug Administration shall not approve for use > in food any chemical additive found to induce cancer in man, or, after > tests, found to induce cancer in animals.Merrill, Richard A. \\"Food Safety > Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause\\" in Annual Review of Public Health, > 1997, 18:313-40. This source includes a useful historical survey of prior > food safety regulation. The Delaney Clause applied to pesticides in processed foods, but only when the concentration of a residue of a cancer-causing pesticide increased during processing; for example when more of a pesticide was present in ketchup than in the raw tomatoes used to make it. (It never applied to pesticides in raw foods.) When the law was passed, \\"neither advocates nor opponents of the policy, including FDA officials, believed it would have broad application, for only a handful of chemicals had then been shown to be animal carcinogens.\\" The Delaney Clause was invoked in 1959 when Arthur Sherwood Flemming, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued a statement advising the public about the possible contamination of substantial quantities of cranberries in Oregon and Washington with the herbicide aminotriazole, which the FDA had recently determined was a carcinogen (see Cranberry scare of 1959). Taking place the week of Thanksgiving, the announcement was referred to by many in the cranberry industry as \\"Black Monday\\" ‚àí sales plummeted, even though many government officials attempted to defuse the scare by declaring their intention to eat cranberries anyway. This episode is regarded as one of the first modern food scares based on a chemical additive. As analytical chemistry became more powerful and able to detect smaller quantities of chemicals, and as chemicals became more widely used, regulatory agencies had an increasingly difficult time administering the Delaney Clause as it \\"recognizes no distinctions based on carcinogenic potency and, at least in theory, it applies equally to additives used in large amounts and to those present at barely detectable levels. It thus takes no account of the actual risk a carcinogenic additive might pose.\\" The FDA was the first agency to have to confront this problem, with respect to the use of diethylstilbestrol to promote the growth of livestock used in meat production, which remained present in the meat. It addressed the issue by using quantitative risk assessment, declaring that if a carcinogenic food additive was present at a concentration of less than 1 part in 1,000,000, the risk was negligible. This standard became known as the \\"de minimis\\" exception to the Delaney Rule and was used throughout the FDA and other agencies. In 1988 the United States Environmental Protection Agency eased restrictions on several pesticides which posed a \\"de minimis\\" risk to humans. This change was challenged by the Natural Resources Defense Council, and overturned in 1992 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Pesticide use was removed from the Delaney Clause in 1996 by an amendment to Title IV of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-170, Sec. 404). The Delaney prohibition appears in three separate parts of the FFDCA: Section 409 on food additives; Section 512, relating to animal drugs in meat and poultry; and Section 721 on color additives. The Section 409 prohibition applied to many pesticide residues until enactment of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. This legislation removed pesticide residue tolerances from Delaney Clause constraints. Many foods contain natural substances which are carcinogenic, for example safrole, which occurs in sassafras and sweet basil. Even these substances are covered by the Delaney clause, so that, for example, safrole may not be added to root beer in the United States.

In the U.S., the picture was later re-released under the title A Deadly Game. A Euston Films production, the movie features David Hemmings, Sir Ralph Richardson, Sam Wanamaker, Pinkas Braun, Ian Richardson, Shane Rimmer and Jennie Linden and was directed by Jack Gold. Plot This Cold War espionage thriller follows the moves of British anti-hero spy Charlie Muffin (Hemmings) who has fallen on hard times since the forced retirement of Sir Archibald Willoughby, his previous boss at the U.K. secret service (played by Sir Ralph Richardson). His new boss, Sir Henry Cuthbertson (Ian Richardson), who epitomises the haughty upper class British imperialist, hardly attempts to conceal his disdain for the under-educated agent who quite obviously does not stem from the \\"right class\\". Right at the start of the film, it is shown how Charlie has evidently been deemed expendable and accordingly gets set up to be caught or killed during a joint mission in East Germany‚Äîthis despite Muffin essentially having been responsible for the mission's success. Cuthbertson's lap-dog agents Snare and Harrison‚Äîwho are both totally lacking in experience and as arrogant as their boss‚Äîare shocked and embarrassed to see Muffin returning alive and well. Once home in the UK, Muffin's humiliation does not end, as he gets demoted and put on leave, which he spends with his wife Edith (Linden), but not until after a hilarious take on the obligatory spy agent‚Äìsecretary-receptionist affair. Next, a classic yet utterly unpredictable spy story unfolds around British and American attempts to facilitate a safe defection of high-ranking Soviet General Valery Kalenin (Braun). Director of Central Intelligence Garson Ruttgers (Wanamaker) proves not much smarter and ultimately equally officious and presumptuous as his British counterpart, though in a distinctly‚Äîsatirically‚ÄîAmerican way. After Harrison and Snare's spectacular downfalls at the task (one ends up dead trying to escape and the other captured), Ruttgers' aide Braley (Rimmer), a good-hearted but docile sideshow official, is assigned to join Muffin on a trip to Prague, to liaise with Kalenin.

Since the end of the Cold War, however, the realism of the film's Cold War background is no longer readily appreciated or even something that a younger audience will notice. Despite extensive use of satirical humour in the film, and despite its spy thriller storyline, it does, with its anti-hero Muffin, have its uplifting moments. The film has never been very widely shown or known, but some of its fans hold it in very high regard.

Its division was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Painavu in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala. Though it is regarded as the second-largest district in the region, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala, the urban population being higher than the rural. Idukki is rich in forests and also known as the \\"Spice Garden of Kerala\\". Till 1998, when Kuttampuzha was added to Ernakulam district, Idukki was the largest district in Kerala. Etymology The name of the district is derived from the Tamil and Malayalam word idukku (‡¥á‡¥ü‡µÅ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µç), meaning narrow gorge. Geography Kattappana Idukki has an area of and is the second- largest district of Kerala (the largest being Palakkad). Rugged mountains and forests cover about 97 per cent of the total area of the district. The district consists of five taluks: Thodupuzha, Devikulam, Idukki, Udumbanchola, and Peerumedu. The district borders the Kerala districts of Pathanamthitta in the south, Kottayam in the southwest, Ernakulam in the northwest, and Thrissur in the north. Idukki also shares borders with Coimbatore, Dindigul, small parts of Tenkasi, Tiruppur, Theni, and Virudhunagar districts of Tamil Nadu in the east. Idukki is not connected to rail or air networks yet and is accessible only by road. National Highway NH 49 and State highways 13 and 33 passes through the district.Kattappana is the main urban centre in the high ranges of Idukki district, situated about 2,788.71‚Äì2,952.76 feet (850.00‚Äì900.00 m) above mean sea level and has recently raised to the status of municipality. Kattappana is a CLASS III urban centre. It is the first municipality in high range of Idukki district with the real terraineous touch of Idukki as Thodupuzhamunicipality is situated in low range. Anamudi and Meesapulimala, the two highest peaks in India south of the Himalayas, are located in Idukki district. Anamudi is situated in the Kuttampuzha Panchayat of Adimali Block in the Kannan Devan Hills village of Devikulam taluk. Thirteen other peaks in the district exceed a height of . Periyar, Thodupuzhayar, Muthirappuzhayar, and Thalayar are the important rivers of the district. Idukki Dam, Asia's largest arch dam, is located in the Idukki Township. The dam is located at the point where the Periyar flows through the gorge formed between two high and massive rocks known as 'Kuravan' and 'Kurathi'. The Idukki Hydroelectric Project caters to more than 60% of the power requirements of the state of Kerala. Demographics According to the 2011 census, Idukki district has a population of 1,108,974. This places it at 416th among the 640 districts of India. The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001‚Äì2011 was ‚àí1.93% due to emigration and low fertility rates. Idukki has a sex ratio of 1,006 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 92.2 percent. Most of the people of Idukki speak Malayalam. The taluks of Thodupuzha and Idukki have a significant population of Malayalam speakers.http://www.theweekendleader.com/Causes/912/idukki-for- tn.htmlhttps://zeenews.india.com/news/kerala/kerala-to-probe-campaign-to-hive- off-idukki-district_820970.html About 40 percent of the people in Munnar are Malayalam speakers. =Technology= Idukki district was the first in India to get connected to a super-fast broad band system as a part of the Digital India campaign. It was also the first to get BSNL 4G in whole country, taking the number of 4G operators in the district to four, including Vodafone Idea Ltd, Jio, and Bharti Airtel. Religion Sree Krishna Swami Temple, Thodupuzha According to the 2011 census, Hindus make up 46.76% (541,854) of the population, with Christians at 45.92% (481,507) and Muslims at 7.32% (82,206). Tourist Spots =Munnar= Tea plantations in Munnar Munnar was the summer resort of the British Government in the south. The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams, namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations in the world. This hill station, which is more than 5,000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes. Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley, and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south. The Palani Hills National Park is proposed to come up to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including the Nilgiri tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood- pigeon, the elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years). The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists. =Vagamon= Vagamon meadows, Kerala, India Western Ghats as seen from Vagamon View Point Vagamon is a hill station situated 1,200 meters above sea level, 37 km from Pala and 42 km from Thodupuzha. This hill station provides options of trekking, para gliding or rock climbing for adventure-seekers, and has many varieties of flora and fauna. Evergreen trees, tall grasses, and shrubs are present in the lower regions of Vagamon. Many rare species of birds, insects, wild buffaloes, and elephants can be easily located in the forests. The main attractions here are mist-covered mountains and lakes, pilgrim centers (Kurishumala, Murugan temple, and burial chamber of a Sufi saint), and pine forests. =Ramakkalmedu= Statue of Kuruvan and Kuruthi in Ramakkalmedu View of Tamil Nadu from Ramakkalmedu Ramakkalmedu (‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥Æ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µΩ‡¥Æ‡µá‡¥ü‡µç‚Äå) is a hill station and hamlet in the Idukki district. It is located about 15 km from Nedumkandam on the Munnar-Thekkady route. Ramakalmedu stands tall in the Western Ghats at a height of 3,500 feet above sea level. The ecosystem of the area consists largely of Shola forest-grasslands, with sporadic bamboo forests. Constant wind is another factor that makes Ramakkalmedu unique. The wind blows at a speed around 35 km/hour throughout the year, irrespective of the season and time. Tourist villages like Pushpakandam and Kuruvikanam near Ramakkalmedu are home to private wind energy farms, with a capacity of about 12.5 MW. This electricity is distributed to the Kerala State Electricity Board. Ramakkalmedu has the potential to produce more electricity, as it is said to be one of the most windy areas in Asia. =Thekkady= Misty Thekkady Cardamom Hills Thekkady is located close to the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, about from Trivandrum, 140 km from Madurai City and Madurai Airport, 145 km from Cochin International Airport, and 114 km from Kottayam railway station. The sanctuary at Thekkady is known for its dense evergreen and semi-evergreen, moist deciduous forests and savanna grass lands. It is home to herds of elephants, sambar, tigers, gaur, lion-tailed macaques and Nilgiri langurs. The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is spread across , of which is thick evergreen forest. The wildlife sanctuary was declared a tiger reserve in 1978. The splendid artificial lake formed by the Mullaperiyar Dam across the Periyar River adds to the charm of the park. The greatest attractions of Periyar are the herds of wild elephants, deer, and bison that come down to drink in the lake. The sanctuary can be accessed through a trekking route, boating, or jeep safari.Tourist Guide to Kerala By Motilal (UK) Books of India, Various, V. Subburaj Thekkady is considered a haven for natural spices such as black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, nutmace, ginger, and clove. Submerged trees in Periyar National Park =Marayur= Walkway through the sandalwood forest Marayur is a remote village on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. Relics of the New Stone Age have been unearthed here. It has ancient stone cabins, called 'Muniyaras', and is the only place in Kerala with natural growth of sandalwood trees. Marayur has more than 1,000 species of flowering plants and is a well-known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of Albizia lathamii, a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar ‚Äì the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur ‚Äì has recorded the largest number of reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, it is one of the richest areas in avian diversity in South India. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, gaur, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri thar, common langur, bonnet macaque, etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons. Maryoor has got a number of sandalwood forests. Processing of sandalwood and its associated oil forms part of the local economy and a depot near Marayur town is supporting this industry. Sandal wood or Santalum album is a parasitic tree having a fragrant and close-grained yellowish heartwood. Sandalwood oil, also known as ‚Äòliquid gold,‚Äô is extracted from the roots and wood of sandalwood. This oil is a costly item marketed at a few choosy outlets all over the state. A climate with low rainfall is suitable for the growth of choice sandalwood trees from which good quality oil can be extracted. The 93 km2 Marayur reserve forest is believed to have about sixty thousand naturally grown sandalwood trees, of which nearly 2,000 trees had been allegedly plundered in just one year since January 2004, when the last survey was conducted. The auction-rate for first quality Marayur sandal is quoted at Rs.1100 per kg, according to forest department sources (2004). Kosamattam Plantation located 3861 Feet above sea level and is ideally located on border belt of the Western Ghats in Idukki district of Kerala. Just 10 Km from Kattapana town and around 23 Km from Kumaly town, this estate is in the location of the cardamom belt of Idukki district. Wildlife sanctuaries =Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary= Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary came into existence in 1976. It is located in the Thodupuzha and Udumbanchola taluks in Idukki district. It has an area of 105.364sq.km. The altitude ranges from 450 to 1272 m. The highest peak is Vanjur Medu (1272m). The major rivers flowing through the area are the Periyar and the Cheruthoniar.http://www.forest.kerala.gov.in/index.php/wildlife/2015-03-16-09-50-24/2015-06-26-09-04-29/idukki- wildlife-sanctuary =Eravikulam Wild Life Sanctuary= Nilagiri Tahr Eravikulam is another wildlife sanctuary proclaimed as a National Park. It supports the largest population of Nilgiri tahr in the world. Anamudi peak is on the southern part of this park. Most of the park is grassland and the average altitude is more than 5000 feet above sea level. Heavy rain and gushing winds make the area inaccessible during the monsoon season. The famous Neelakurinji (Strobilanthes kunthiana) grows here. It has a flowering cycle of 12 years. Twenty-six species of mammals have been recorded in the park including the largest surviving population of Nilgiri tahr, estimated at about 750 individuals. The other ungulates are gaur, Indian muntjac and sambar deer. Golden jackal, jungle cat, wild dog, dhole, leopard and tiger are the main predators. Some little-known animals such as Nilgiri langur, stripe-necked mongoose, Indian porcupine, Nilgiri marten, small clawed otter, ruddy mongoose, and dusky palm squirrel are also found.UNEP (05/07/2007) World Commission on Protected Areas, World Database on Protected Areas, Eravikulam National Park, Retrieved 7 May 2007 Elephants make seasonal visits. 132 species of birds have been recorded which include endemics like black-and- orange flycatcher, Nilgiri pipit, Nilgiri wood pigeon, white bellied shortwing, Nilgiri flycatcher and Kerala laughingthrush. Endemic butterflies confined to the shola-grass land ecosystem like the red disk bushbrown and Palni four-wing are among the 101 species in the park. =Periyar Tiger Reserve= Periyar Tiger Reserve, Thekkady, is sprawled over an area of 925 km2. Periyar is one of the 50 tiger reserves in India. This zealously guarded and efficiently managed reserve is a repository of rare, endemic and endangered flora and fauna, and forms the major watershed of two important rivers of Kerala, the Periyar, and Pamba.

Neriamangalam Bridge The Neriamangalam Bridge, built across the Periyar river, is often referred to as 'The Gateway to the Highranges' as it is on the way to the higher regions of Idukki district, especially Munnar. The bridge was made by the Maharaja of Travancore in 1935. Neryamangalam bridge =Rail= At present, there is no railway in and to Idukki district of Kerala. The nearest railway stations are Kottayam (station code ‚Äì KTYM), Aluva (Alwaye, station code ‚Äì AWY), Ernakulam South (Ernakulam Jn., station code ‚Äì ERS) and Ernakulam North (Ernakulam Town, station code ‚Äì ERN). There was a rail line that existed in the district during colonial period called, Kundala Valley Railway. It got destroyed in the Great flood of 99 in 1924. =Air= The nearest airport to Idukki is Cochin International Airport and Coimbatore Airport. Airport Authority of India's plan to set up an airport in Anakkara is in a conflict of environmental issues. Anakkara Airport will be a great leap in Idukki's complete development. The government claims this project will improve the tourism in the area. However, with Anakkara being situated in environmentally sensitive Western Ghats, environmentalists and villagers argue that this can significantly impact the area's climatic conditions and livelihood of people. Also, the land identified for the project is one of the very few remaining paddy fields of the district, currently cultivating some of the rare indigenous varieties of rice which increases the concern about the project. Those opposing the airport also cite the economic benefits as Munnar, one of the key target destinations for the airport lies at about 100 km from Anakkara and the time taken to reach there from Cochin International Airport is less than the time taken to reach from Anakkara. Though there are no clear references online from the government on the objectives, benefits, and purpose of the proposed airport, anti-Anakkara-airport groups have set up social networking campaign sites explaining reasons why they claim the airport project should not be implemented.

On a case-by-case basis, the MCSGR may be awarded posthumously without regard to period of service. Personnel transferred early for the Good of the Service must have served a minimum of 12 months in the program to be eligible for this award. Personnel transferred due to Relief for Cause are not eligible for the ribbon. History To be awarded the Marine Corps Security Guard Ribbon, a service member must hold the Marine Corps military occupational specialty (MOS) 8156 (previously 8151) Marine Corps Security Guard and must have served twenty-four months of service at an American embassy or consulate. The award is only awarded to Marine Security Guards for their service at American Embassies or Consulates in a foreign country. Recently, Marine Corps Embassy Security Group has begun to award the MSG Ribbon to Regional Command Staff as well without the prerequisite of serving as an 8156, to include Regional Inspecting Officers, which has created a controversy based on the belief that there is an intentional bias towards awarding the Regional Officers and Command Staff, while at the same time not awarding the ribbon to the junior Marines residing in the same geographical location within the same command.

Note the unbalanced line. \\"C\\" will snap the ball, even though he is not strictly in the center. This diagram uses the modern terms. In the original single wing, the primary ball handler was called the \\"tailback\\" and \\"quarterback\\" was used as a blocking back. In American and Canadian football, a single-wing formation was a precursor to the modern spread or shotgun formation. The term usually connotes formations in which the snap is tossed rather than handed‚Äîformations with one wingback and a handed snap are commonly called \\"wing T\\" or \\"winged T\\". Created by Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner, the single wing was superior to the T formation in its ability to get an extra eligible receiver down field.Powers, Francis J. (1969). Life Story of Glen S. (Pop) Warner, Gridiron's Greatest Strategist. Chicago, IL: The Athletic Institute. p. 54 History Among coaches, single-wing football denotes a formation using a long snap from center as well as a deceptive scheme that evolved from Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner's offensive style. Traditionally, the single-wing was an offensive formation that featured a core of four backs including a tailback, a fullback, a quarterback (blocking back), and a wingback. Linemen were set \\"unbalanced\\", with two on one side of the center and four on the other. This was done by moving the off-side guard or tackle to the strong side. The single-wing was one of the first formations attempting to trick the defense instead of over-powering it. Single-wing formation similar to Pop Warner's playbook. Pop Warner referred to his new offensive scheme as the Carlisle formation because he formulated most of the offense while coaching the Carlisle Indians. The term single-wing came into widespread use after spectators noticed that the formation gave the appearance of a wing- shape. In 1907, Warner coached at Carlisle, a school for Native Americans, where his legacy consisted of at least three significant events. The first was the discovery of Jim Thorpe's raw athletic ability. The second was the use of an extensive passing game that relied on the spiraled ball. Finally, faking backs who started one way, but abruptly headed the opposite way, kept defenses guessing. Because Jim Thorpe had so much raw talent, Coach Warner more than likely designed much of his single-wing offense around this gifted athlete. Thorpe, the proverbial triple threat, was a good runner, passer, and punter. Glenn Scobey \\"Pop\\" Warner at the University of Pittsburgh in 1917. For much of the history of the single-wing formation, players were expected to play on both sides of the ball. Consequently, offensive players often turned around to play a corresponding location on defense. The offensive backs played defensive backs, just as the offensive linemen played defensive linemen. Unlike teams of today, single-wing teams had few specialists who only played on certain downs. College football playbooks prior to the 1950s were dominated with permutations of the traditional single-wing envisioned by Warner. Two-time All-American Jack Crain's handwritten playbook clearly denotes how the University of Texas ran their version of the single-wing circa 1939‚Äì1940. University of Texas Coach Dana X. Bible ran a balanced line, which means that there were the same numbers of linemen on each side of the center. Also, the ends were slightly split.Jack Crain Slightly splitting offensive ends, called flexing, was in widespread use by Notre Dame's Box variation of the single-wing. Knute Rockne's Notre Dame Box offense employed a balanced line, which had 3 linemen on each side of the center. Another Rockne innovation was a shifting backfield that attempted to confuse the defense by moving backs to alternate positions right before the snap. Another variation of the single-wing saw the quarterback move out as a wingback on the weak side. Besides adding different blocking angles for the quarterback, the double-wing formation facilitated the passing game. Stanford had a variation on the double-wing in which the quarterback stayed right behind the strong side guard, while the tailback became the wingback to the weak side. The fullback, being the only deep back left, took all the snaps and directed the plays. The advent of the T formation in the 1940s led to a decline in the use of single-wing formations. For example, the single-wing coach Dana X. Bible, upon his retirement in 1946, saw his replacement, Blair Cherry, quickly install the T formation like many other college coaches of the day. Wallace Wade said he was \\"not convinced that the single wing is not a more potent formation than the T. The single wing we used caused the defense to spread. It called for more intensive coaching on individual assignments.\\" However, from 1949 to 1957 Henry \\"Red\\" Sanders elevated a seldom distinguished UCLA football program to an elite level with his precision single-wing system, winning a National Championship at UCLA in 1954. The single-wing style of football is still practiced by a small group of teams across the country, almost exclusively at the high school and youth level. The Pittsburgh Steelers were the last NFL team to use the single-wing as their standard formation, finally switching to the T formation in 1952.Official site of the Pittsburgh Steelers - Team History In 2008, the Miami Dolphins utilized a version of the single-wing offense (calling it the \\"wildcat\\") against the New England Patriots on six plays, which produced four touchdowns in a 38‚Äì13 upset victory, and again two weeks later defeating the San Diego Chargers.Stephen Wine, \\"Dolphins help the single wing make a comeback\\", USA Today, October 10, 2008. In college football, by the early 1960s the only major teams still relying on the single wing were Tennessee, UCLA, and Princeton; after 1964 only Princeton, which had been particularly known for the single wing under its longtime coach Charlie Caldwell, still used the formation, finally giving it up in 1969 after the retirement of Caldwell's successor Dick Colman.\\"Dick Colman, Former Coach\\", The New York Times, April 7, 1982. =Sutherland single wing= The Sutherland single-wing was a variation of the single-wing used with great success by Coach Jock Sutherland of the 1930s and 1940s. Note that coach Sutherland mastered many forms of the single-wing, but the formation described here is the one he invented and was named for him. The Sutherland single-wing differs from the traditional single-wing in that the wingback is brought into the backfield as a halfback, flanking the fullback on the other side from the tailback. This allows a more flexible running attack to the weak-side. Both the tailback and halfback are triple threats in this offense. The weakness of this formation is less power than the traditional single-wing and it requires very talented backs to play tailback and halfback effectively. Sutherland created this formation from the original single-wing he learned from legendary coach Pop Warner at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1910s. Sutherland became the Pitt coach in 1924, where he remained through 1938. Sutherland's Pitt teams were named \\"National Champions\\" by various selectors in nine different seasons, including five recognized by the university. Sutherland was the avowed master of the single-wing offense while at Pitt. Sutherland brought his coaching skills to the NFL in 1940 as the coach of the Brooklyn Dodgers. At Brooklyn, he took over a team that had never finished better than second and had only one winning record since 1930. He implemented his offensive ideas and the Dodgers finished with a record of 8‚Äì3 and finished only a game back from the Washington Redskins. Sutherland's star was Ace Parker, who played tailback and was NFL MVP. The Dodgers also finished in second in 1941, with a 7‚Äì4 mark. Later, Sutherland coached the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1946 and 1947. In 1947, Sutherland and his single-wing pushed the Steelers to their first playoff appearance, for the East Conference crown. They were soundly defeated by Greasy Neale's Philadelphia Eagles, running the T-formation, 21‚Äì0. Sutherland died suddenly in 1948, but the Steelers continued to use his single-wing until 1953, when they were the last NFL team to switch to the T. Runningback Austin Horton also rushed for 1,245 yards during the Sutherland season. =Double wing= The double-wing is an offensive formation which should not be confused with the Double Wing offense. The double-wing formation is used in many offenses from the youth level through college. The formation was first introduced by Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner around 1912. Just a few offenses that use the formation are the double wing, flexbone and wing T offenses. It was the primary formation used by Ara Parseghian when he ran the wing T at Notre Dame, winning National Championships in 1966 and 1973. Double Wing Formation The formation is not necessarily the same in all offenses and is often a broad term to describe any offense with two wingbacks. In the wing T, the double- wing formation is used to refer to Red, Blue and Loose Red formations. The double-wing formation in American football usually includes one wide receiver, two wingbacks, one fullback, and one tight end. Single-wing style of play The direct snap or toss from the center usually went to the tailback or fullback; however, the quarterback could also take the ball. The tailback was very important to the success of the offense because he had to run, pass, block, and even punt. Unlike today, the quarterback usually blocked at the point of attack. As with his modern day counterpart, a single-wing quarterback might also act as a field general by calling plays. The fullback was chosen for his larger size so that he could \\"buck\\" the line. This meant that the fullback would block or carry the ball between the defensive tackles. The wingback could double-team block with an offensive lineman at scrimmage or even run a pass route. The single-wing formation was designed to place double- team blocks at the point of attack. Gaining this extra blocker was achieved in several ways. First, the unbalanced line placed an extra guard or tackle on one side of the center. Second, a wingback stationed outside end could quickly move to a crucial blocking position. Third, the fullback and especially the quarterback could lead the ball carrier producing interference. Finally, linemen, usually guards, would pull at the snap and block at the specified hole. Line splits were always close except for ends who might move out from the tackle. The single-wing formation depended on a center who was skilled both at blocking and at tossing the ball from between his legs to the receiving back. The center had to direct the ball to any of several moving backs, with extreme accuracy, as the play started. Single-wing plays would not work efficiently if the back had to wait on the snap because quick defensive penetration would overrun the play. The center was taught to direct the ball to give the tailback or fullback receiver a running start in the direction that the play was designed to go. The single-wing formation was a deceptive formation with spectators, referees, and defensive players often losing sight of the ball. A backfield player, called a \\"spinner\\", might turn 360 degrees while faking the ball to the other backs, or even keeping the ball or passing it. Defensive players were often fooled as to which back was carrying the ball. The one play that was unique to the single-wing formation was the buck- lateral series. The terminology for this series of plays associates the word \\"buck\\" with the intent of the fullback to plunge into the line. In addition, the short toss, or lateral of the ball, can be made to the quarterback or wingback who may take the ball and do other maneuvers including passing the ball. Consequently, when the fullback takes the ball, he appears to be headed to buck the line. Typically, fullbacks were bigger players who ran plays intended to smash the defensive front. The fullback's initial move pulls the defensive players toward the expected point of attack. Next, the fullback tosses the ball to another back causing the defense to change pursuit angles, thus losing a step in their catching the ball carrier. The strong side of the formation, where the extra lineman and wingback lined-up, put pressure on the defensive end. Defenses might move extra players to that side or shift the whole defense to compensate. The cut-back play could succeed regardless of how the defense reacted. The cut-back play started like a strong side sweep with offensive guards and quarterback running interference for the tailback. The fullback would fake a smash over the guard hole to occupy the defensive tackles. The play was designed to make the defensive end overreact and try to stay outside to contain the runner. If the defensive end gave ground to the sideline, the tailback would cut-back inside to let his interference push the defensive end out of the play. If the defensive end came too far inside, then the ball carrier would run around him to the outside. After the cut-back play was used in a game, then the offense might run the wingback reverse since both plays started out the same way. At the outset, the defense tries to pursue the sweeping tailback. However, the tailback delivers the ball to the wingback running the opposite way to the weak side. Both the cut-back and the reverse would be set up with quick fullback bucks up the middle, which would cause the defensive line to over-protect their gaps, as opposed to pursuing quickly to the sideline. Single-wing punt formation similar to Pop Warner's playbook. Single-wing teams used both a standard punting formation and a quick punt, often kicking on second or third downs. The quick punt, or quick kick, saw the tailback-punter quickly backing up 5 yards as the ball was in the air from the center to distance him from rushers. The strategy was to keep defensive halfbacks, expecting a possession play, from dropping back to return the ball. The standard punt formation was often used for either punting as well as running or passing the ball. Most teams had a litany of plays that they might run from a punt formation. Prior to 1930 the shape of the football was a prominent oval shape called a prolate spheroid. Due to the shape of the ball, single-wing backs handled the ball more like a basketball, with short tosses and underhand lobs. Gradually, balls were allowed to be elongated enough to produce streamlined passes with a spiral. The spiraled ball could be thrown farther with more accuracy, thus increasing the potential for offenses to use the forward pass more frequently. The single-wing melon-shaped ball measures from 28 to 22 inches in circumference, while the modern ball measures approximately 21 inches.The single-wing quarterback played a different role than modern-day quarterbacks. While the quarterback may have called the snap count due to his position close to the center of the formation, he may not have called the actual play in the huddle. For much of the history of football, coaches were not allowed to call plays from the sideline. This responsibility may have gone to the team captain. The quarterback was expected to be an excellent blocker at the point of attack. Some playbooks referred to this player as the blocking back. The quarterback also had to handle the ball by faking, handing off, or optioning to other backs. Modern use Although the single-wing has lost much of its popularity since World War II, its characteristic features are still prevalent in all levels of modern football. They include pulling guards, double teams, play action passes, laterals, wedge blocking, trap blocking, the sweep, the reverse and the quick kick. Many current offenses, such as the spread option, use single-wing tendencies for running plays, while using wide receivers instead of wingbacks. Once a strong running formation, the single wing has been replaced by formations that facilitate passing, while minimizing the running aspect of the game. Today the single-wing has evolved into what coaches call the spread offense or shotgun, with the emphasis on passing. The most noticeable feature that remains of the powerful Carlisle formation is the long toss from center to the main ball- handler. The main talent and field general has become the quarterback instead of the tailback. The other single-wing backs have moved close to the line of scrimmage and are split farther from the main line. Wide receivers are called split-ends, flex ends, slots, and flankers. Also, linemen spacing has increased in distance. Moving offensive players farther apart serves the purpose of also spreading the defense. The goal is to make defenses cover the whole field on every play. The current incarnation of the Wildcat offense, which has been adopted by many college, NFL, and high school teams uses many elements of the single-wing formation. =Successful teams= The single-wing has had a successful revival at youth leagues, middle schools, high schools, and some colleges. Here are some examples of single-wing high school teams that have had success all across the country. In 2005, Virginia saw three teams ride the single-wing to the state playoffs. Two of the three teams, Giles High School and Osbourn High School, actually won their division. Giles High School returned to the state championship game in 2006, and also won state championships using the single wing in both 1980 and 2013. In 1998 and 1999, Park View High School in Sterling, Virginia advanced to consecutive state championships using the single wing offense. When Park View coach Mickey Thompson moved to nearby Stone Bridge High School in 2000, he took the single wing with him. As a result, the Bulldogs have won 9 District titles, 6 Region titles and won the 2007 AAA Division 5 State title game, 38‚Äì0, against Potomac High School. On February 1, 2010 Stone Bridge Offensive Coordinator Matt \\"Hate-Dog\\" Griffis was named Head Coach of nearby Broad Run High School. Griffis announced he will be running the Single Wing as well as his hybrid Single Wing formation dubbed the \\"Griff-Bone\\". Tower Hill School in Wilmington Delaware perfected this formation which led to numerous state championships. Warren County High School in Front Royal, Va. also used the single-wing to moderate success. In Louisa County, Va., the local high school has had similar success by running the single-wing formation since 2003. Colton California has been a consistently successful single-wing team by reaching the state playoffs on six consecutive seasons. In 1998 The Menominee Maroons won the Michigan high school class BB football championship, and in 2006 and 2007 won the Michigan High School Class B football championship, winning 28 consecutive games over the last 2 years, and reaching the state playoffs for the last 11 years. In 1971 the Corning High School Cardinals of Corning, California had a 9‚Äì0 undefeated season utilizing a balanced single-wing offense under coach Tag McFadden. They were the number one rated school Division 4 in the state and Mcfadden was garnered coach of year by Cal-Hi Sports. In 1974 and 1975, St. Mark's School (MA) compiled a 13‚Äì1 record running the Princeton Single Wing. In 1980 Coach Ted Hern brought the single-wing to Moriarty High School, the \\"Fighting\\" Pintos made three state championship appearances winning 2 state titles, one undefeated season and suffering only 3 losses in four seasons. Coach Frank Ortiz was an assistant coach in the later seasons. Since 1985, Santa Rosa High School has used the single-wing formation under Coach Frank Ortiz. The Lions have made the playoffs every year except three, won their district title 17 times, won the New Mexico AA State Championships in 1993, 1996, 1998, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012 and made a total of 13 State Finals appearances. Xavier High School's (NYC) Head Coach Chris Stevens recently changed the team's offense to the single-wing. In 2007, they went 11‚Äì1, and averaged 39 points in the New York Catholic High School Football League A Division. They had two 1,000-yard rushers in Seamus Kelly and Jimmy Kowalski, while both also scored 17 TDs. In the championship game trailing by two scores with less than 8 minutes to play, Xavier scored 31 unanswered points to win their first championship in over 10 years. The following week they beat Fordham Prep 20-14 in the annual \\"Turkey Bowl\\", a game that dates back to the late 1800s. Running the single-wing since 2006, they have been at the top of league in rushing. In 2007, they were in the top three rushing and scoring schools in New York. They again won a championship in the New York Catholic High School Football League in 2012 this one coming in the AA division. They averaged 34 points a game scoring 35 or more points 9 times, rushed for 46 touchdowns and 3,700 yards with a 9-2 record. In 2005 St. Mary's of Lynn in Massachusetts won the D4A Eastern Mass Title following two consecutive division titles with Ed Melanson running the Single Wing. Prior to Coach Melanson installing the Single Wing there in 2002, St. Mary's had not had a winning season since 1977. In Kansas, Mark Bliss installed the Single Wing offense at Conway Springs High School in 1997, coaching the team to Kansas Class 3A state championships in 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2003. During his seven seasons at Conway Springs, his teams compiled a record of 81‚Äì4, including a 62-game winning streak. Conway Springs continues to run the Single Wing offense and added state titles in 2004, 2008, and again in 2011 and are perennial playoffs contenders under Coach Matt Biehler. In Kansas, Ed Buller created a football dynasty centered around the Single Wing offense. In his 40 years of coaching, which ended in 1984, Buller's only losing season was his first. Buller compiled a record of 335‚Äì78‚Äì7 and coached the Clyde Bluejays to 10 undefeated seasons along with 39 consecutive winning seasons. In Nebraska Dave Cisar's Screaming Eagle youth football teams have been running the Single Wing offense for 8 seasons. During that time period those teams have gone 78-5 and averaged over 35 points per contest and won two State Titles. He did this with 6 totally different teams in 4 different leagues in various age groups. His teams even used the famous \\"fullback full spinner series\\" along with the other traditional Single Wing plays. Coach Cisar published a book \\"Winning Youth Football a Step by Step Plan\\" in 2006 to help youth coaches install this \\"old school\\" offense. In Connecticut Anthony Sagnella runs the single wing with his North Haven High School Team that reached the 2015 Class L state Championship Game and were defeated by New Caanan, 42‚Äì35. Tailback Mike Montano was an All-State Selection as a RB with over 1800 Rushing yards and 30 TDs. In Colorado, Brian Christensen's Akron Rams (Class 1A) high school football team has made running the Single Wing offense a local tradition. Akron won back-to-back undefeated state championships in 2001 and 2002. They also took home State titles in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Christensen's teams have made the playoffs every year since 1996 and have made it to at least the semi- finals of the state playoffs all but 4 times within that span. The Akron Rams are renowned for their \\"exceptional prowess executing the single-wing offense.\\" One coach characterized Akron's single-wing attack as, \\"A Chinese fire-drill in the backfield every single play. You have to play mistake-free defense or Akron's single-wing attack will burn you.\\" Christensen took over the Akron program in 1996, his overall record at Akron is: 163‚Äì31 (.841 winning percentage). In Iowa, Bob Howard, the coach of the Sigourney-Keota Savage Cobras (2A), has led the Cobras to three state championships (1995, 2001, 2005), using the single-wing offense. He used the offense when he first started coaching at Sigourney in the 1970s, before Sigourney and Keota conjoined teams. In 2005 the vaulted Cobra single-wing offense set a new state record for points in a season with 696, 537 of which coming in the nine regular season games, and in 2007 the Cobras set a new state rushing record racking up 718 yards in a single game. Howard left Sigourney-Keota after the 2006 season to become the new head coach at Webster City High School and was charged with rebuilding a once-proud program that hadn't won over six games or made the Class 3A playoffs since 1996. Installing his vaunted single-wing offense, in 2007 the Lynx led District 2 in rushing by gaining over 2,200 yards on the ground despite their overall record of 3‚Äì6. However, in 2008, the Lynx not only made the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, but also finished the season with a final record of 7‚Äì4. Tailback John Hill rushed for 1,420 yards‚Äîthe sixth highest total in school history. On September 21, 2008, the Miami Dolphins used a version of the single-wing offense (specifically the Wildcat offense) against the New England Patriots on six plays, which produced five touchdowns (four rushing and one passing) in a 38‚Äì13 upset victory, after its successful adoption on the college and high school level by several teams. The 1957 Cass Township, exclusively used single-wing offense. The Cass (Schuylkill County) PA Condors rolled through a season unbeaten, untied, and unscored upon over 50 years ago, going 9‚Äì0 in the regular season before defeating Shamokin, 2‚Äì0, in a special playoff for the Eastern Conference Southern Division title for a season of 10‚Äì0. They are the only high school football team in Pennsylvania that can lay claim to that feat. The late Coach Pat Droskinis, listed in the PA Sports Hall of Fame, coached them and led by a strong 4‚Äì5‚Äì2 defense that featured All-State ends in 6-foot-3 Russ Frantz and 6-2 Harry Butsko, the Cass Twp Condors blanked Minersville, Nescopeck, West Mahanoy Township, Schuylkill Haven, Ashland, Blythe Township, Mahanoy Township, Lansford and Saint Clair, and then Shamokin in the playoff game (2‚Äì0). In Pittsburgh, Coach Pete Dimperio ran the single wing at Westinghouse High School from 1946 to this retirement in 1966. Westinghouse played in the City League championship game every one of those 21 years and they won 17 times. Coach Dimperio's league play record was a phenomenal 118‚Äì5‚Äì1 and (158‚Äì26‚Äì1 overall). His Bulldog teams ran the single-wing formation with mostly buck-lateral and fullback spinner plays. He did not use a multitude of plays, rather he won because his players were so well-schooled and disciplined they were all but unstoppable. When Coach Dimperio started at Westinghouse the student body was mostly the children of Italian immigrants, but by the late 1950s it was almost 100% African American. It didn't matter to Coach Dimperio; he and his single wing won nonetheless. Being from a relatively poor inner city school, Westinghouse usually had no assistant coaches and rarely suited up more than 40 players. Yet, in exhibition games against some of the biggest suburban schools, Westinghouse usually won. Once in an exhibition game against South Hills Catholic which suited up 90 players and had five coaches, Coach Dimperio's deceptive single wing made mincemeat of the heavier and slow opponent to the point where one of the South Hills Catholic coaches remarked, \\"they (the Westinghouse backs) ran down the field so many times it looked like track practice.\\" Coach Dimperio was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1964. Keith W. Piper, head coach at Denison University (Ohio) had played center in the single wing in high school and at Baldwin-Wallace University, and he went against trends by using that offense for three seasons at Denison in the early 1960s. After the Big Red went 0‚Äì8‚Äì1 in 1977, he returned to the single wing for good because tailback Clay Sampson offered a dual threat. He became the only player in Division III history to rush for 3,000 yards and pass for 3,000 in a career when he totaled 6,920 yards for Denison from 1977 to '80. In 1985 Piper's single wing offense featured a potent mix of speed, athleticism and experience that produced an average victory margin of 29.6 points. That year Denison set nine school season team records‚Äîincluding most total yards of offense (4,330), most rushing yards (3,510) and most points (377)‚Äîand set five single game school marks.

The show took place outside of every venue of the NASCAR Cup Series. Host Steve Byrnes moderated debates involving a four-person panel of sportswriters whose columns are mostly about racing. The three primary panelists were Mike Mulhern of the Winston-Salem Journal, David Poole of The Charlotte Observer, and Marty Smith of NASCAR.com. The fourth panelist usually rotated between writers like Ben Blake, Lee Spencer of The Sporting News, and Speed Channel website writer Robin Miller. The panelists eventually became known as the \\"Pit Hogs.\\" Format Each week, the panel debated hot topics from the NASCAR world. At the end of the show, the four panelists got time to state their \\"beef\\" with an issue in NASCAR. It could've been a topic not yet touched on, a past issue, or a current issue. A live audience watched the show up-close each week. Each episode was a half-hour long. Criticism The show drew ire from NASCAR officials and drivers for its panelists' consistently questioning a NASCAR ruling or such. Then, one night, on another SPEED program, NASCAR Inside Nextel Cup, NASCAR driver Jimmy Spencer, a panelist on that night's episode, slammed Pit Bull as being \\"anti-NASCAR.\\" Many Pit Bull fans jokingly claimed that since they agreed with most of what was being questioned of NASCAR by the panel (and most of the time, it was Mulhern and Blake doing the questioning) that they were \\"anti-NASCAR\\", even though they were NASCAR fans. Pit Bull debuted in February 2004, but on November 23, 2004, it was announced by SPEED that low ratings would keep the show from returning in 2005. Many Pit Bull viewers got upset, though, accusing NASCAR of having a say in the show's cancellation because of its ability to question them. However another debate show debuted in 2006, this time NASCAR-related and was named Tradin' Paint but was similar though it had NASCAR drivers like Kyle Petty as panelists debating NASCAR issues in a similar fashion.

Loosely attached to the high church party, he was appointed Bishop of Llandaff from 1819 to 1826, a post which he held in commendam with the Deanery of St Paul's between 1820 and 1826, when he was translated to Durham. Prior to this, he had been rector of the church of St. Mary-le-Bow in London and Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, where he gave the Bampton Lectures for 1814. Van Mildert is often described as a 'stormy petrel' on account of his outspoken expression of his views. As Bishop of Llandaff he broke with the practice of his predecessors and actually resided in the diocese. As the bishop's palace had fallen to ruin, he rented Coldbrook House near Abergavenny. During his time in Llandaff, he gained a reputation as \\"a conscientious diocesan\\". As part of the University of Durham's foundation, behind which he was the driving force, he gave Durham Castle to the university, where it became the home of University College. Auckland Castle therefore became the sole residence of the Bishop of Durham. In addition, he donated a large number of buildings on Palace Green, between the Castle and the Cathedral. These are currently in use by various departments of the university (principally law, music and a small portion of the University Library). Van Mildert was the last Bishop of Durham with significant temporal powers as a Palatinate Prince-Bishop. Those secular powers were removed and returned to the Crown after his death in 1836 by the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836. In truth, most of the secular power of the Bishop of Durham had already been removed by that time. The Great Reform Act 1832 saw the removal of most of the Prince Bishop's powers although he maintained a seat in the House of Lords and The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 gave the governing power of the town of Durham to an elected body.

The series' script is very close to Dostoevsky's original text, and the series features well-known Russian actors. According to bonus materials included on the DVD, in order to improve authenticity, serious efforts were made to capture the spirit of the time, through proper way of speaking, and through very careful selection of costumes for the actors to wear. The series was branded by the novel's original pre-1920s orthography title \\"–∏–¥—ñ–æ—Ç—ä\\" (in all caps) instead of the current \\"–∏–¥–∏–æ—Ç\\" as one will find it on the bookshelves in Russia (to promote the atmosphere of the tsarist time when the film's plot takes place). This branded title \\"–ò–î–Ü–û–¢–™\\" can be seen at the beginning of each part and on the cover of the DVD release. The series consists of 10 parts each approximately 50 minutes.

This, however, is the director's mistake. Dostoevsky himself died in 1881, and the novel is set earlier. (It was written in 1869.) While this flag was already used in tsarist Russia, it was admitted for use on land only in 1883 (previously used on sea) and became the official flag of the empire in 1896. Thus, the black-gold-silver tsarist flag should have been used in the film.

Their colors range from white (such as Muscat Ottonel), to yellow (Moscato Giallo), to pink (Moscato rosa del Trentino) to near black (Muscat Hamburg). Muscat grapes and wines almost always have a pronounced sweet floral aroma. The breadth and number of varieties of Muscat suggest that it is perhaps the oldest domesticated grape variety, and there are theories that most families within the Vitis vinifera grape variety are descended from the Muscat variety.J. Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines pg 183 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Among the most notable members of the Muscat family are Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains, which is the primary grape variety used in the production of the Italian sparkling wine Asti (also known as Moscato Asti) made in the Piedmont region. It is also used in the production of many of the French fortified wines known as vin doux naturels. In Australia, this is also the main grape used in the production of Liqueur Muscat, from the Victorian wine region of Rutherglen. Young, unaged and unfortified examples of Muscat blanc tend to exhibit the characteristic Muscat \\"grapey\\" aroma as well as citrus, rose and peach notes. Fortified and aged examples (particularly those that have been barrel aged) tend to be very dark in color due to oxidation with aroma notes of coffee, fruit cake, raisins and toffee.Wine & Spirits Education Trust Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality, pgs 6‚Äì9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, Muscat of Alexandria is another Muscat variety commonly used in the production of French vin doux naturel, but it is also found in Spain, where it is used to make many of the fortified Spanish Moscatels. Elsewhere it is used to make off-dry to sweet white wines, often labeled as Moscato in Australia, California and South Africa. In Alsace and parts of Central Europe, Muscat Ottonel is used to produce usually dry and highly perfumed wines.  History  While there are theories that the origin of the Muscat family date back to ancient antiquity, there is no solid historical evidence that Muscat grapevines were among the grape varieties cultivated by civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians (papyrus image from the 15th-century BC tomb of Nakht). Theories about the origins of Muscat grapes date ancestors of the varieties back to the ancient Egyptians and Persians of early antiquity (c. 3000-1000 BC) while some ampelographers, such as Pierre Galet, believe that the family of Muscat varieties were propagated during the period of classical antiquity (c. 800 BC to 600 AD) by the Greeks and Romans. However, while domestic wine production had a long history in ancient Egypt and Persia and classical writers such as Columella and Pliny the Elder did describe very \\"muscat-like\\" grape varieties such as Anathelicon Moschaton and Apianae that were very sweet and attractive to bees (Latin apis), there is no solid historical evidence that these early wine grapes were members of the Muscat family.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 678-696 Allen Lane 2012 The first documented mention of grapes called \\"muscat\\" was in the works of the English Franciscan scholar Bartholomeus Anglicus who wrote of wine made from Muscat grapes in his work De proprietatibus rerum written between 1230 and 1240 while Anglicus was studying in what is now modern Saxony in Germany. Anglicus' Latin work was translated into French in 1372 with the wine being described by Anglicus as \\"vin extrait de raisins muscats\\".  Origins of the name \\"Muscat\\"  The \\"musky\\" aroma of ripe Muscat grapes has been known to attract bees (pictured), flies and other insects Because the exact origins of the Muscat family cannot be pinpointed, the theories as to the origins of the name \\"Muscat\\" are numerous. The most commonly cited belief is the name is derived from the Persian word muchk. Similar etymology follows the Greek moskos, Latin muscus and French musc. In Italy, the Italian word mosca for fly could also be one possibility with the sweet aroma and high sugar levels of Muscat grapes being a common attractant for insects such as fruit flies.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 35, 100, 450, 453, 463-466 Oxford University Press 2006 Other theories suggest that the grape family originated in the Arabian country of Oman and was named after the city of Muscat located on the coast of the Gulf of Oman. Another city that is sometimes suggested as a potential birthplace/namesake is the Greek city of Moschato, located southwest of Athens in Attica with Moschato being a common synonym in Greece for Muscat varieties.  Closely related varieties  Muscat d'Eisenstadt (also known as \\"Muscat de Saumur\\"), one of the parent varieties of Muscat Ottonel Of the more than 200 grape varieties sharing \\"Muscat\\" (or one of its synonyms) in their name, the majority are not closely related to each other. The exception are the members of the Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria families. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that Muscat of Alexandria was, itself, a natural crossing of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and a black-skinned table grape variety from the Greek islands known as Axina de Tres Bias. Rarely seen outside of Greece, Axina de Tres Bias (also known as \\"Heftakilo\\") is also grown in Malta and Sardinia. Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria, themselves, have crossed and have produced at least 14 different grape varieties, 5 of which are mostly cultivated in South America and 9 still found in Italy though none are of major use in wine production. More notable and widely planted offspring have come from Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria crossing with other grape varieties, such as the Argentine wine grapes of Cereza, Torront√©s Riojano and Torront√©s Sanjuanino, stemming from a cross of Muscat of Alexandria with \\"List√°n negro\\" (also known as the \\"Mission grape\\") Muscat of Alexandria has also been crossed with the German / Italian wine grape Trollinger (also known as \\"Schiava Grossa\\") to produce Muscat of Hamburg and Malvasia del Lazio, and with the Italian wine grapes Catarratto bianco and Bombino bianco to produce the Marsala wine grape Grillo and Moscatello Selvatico, respectively. Muscat Ottonel is the result of a crossing between one Muscat variety, \\"Muscat d'Eisenstadt\\" (also known as \\"Muscat de Saumur\\"), with the Swiss wine grape Chasselas Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains has been identified as one of the parent grapes of several varieties, though with which crossing partner is currently unknown. These include the Italian wine grapes Aleatico, Moscato Giallo (Yellow Moscato), Moscato rosa del Trentino (Pink Moscato of Trentino) and Moscato di Scanzo. DNA analysis was able to identify the Tuscan wine grape Mammolo as the second parent variety that crossed with Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains to produce Muscat rouge de Mad√®re (Red Muscat of Mad√®re).  Characteristic aromas and confusion with other grapes  The characteristic floral, \\"grapey\\" aroma of Muscat can be seen in wines such as Moscato d'Asti, made in a winemaking style that emphasizes the varietal aromas of the grape, rather than aromas derived from winemaking processes like oak aging or autolysis on the lees Despite the vast diversity in the Muscat family, one common trait that can be seen in most all Muscat members is the characteristic floral, \\"grapey\\" aroma note that is caused by the high concentration of monoterpenes in the grapes. More than 40 different monoterpenes have been discovered in Muscat grapes (as well as in other aromatic varieties like Riesling and Gew√ºrztraminer); these include citronellol, geraniol, linalool and nerol. This characteristic \\"musk\\" aroma can be best observed in light bodied, low alcohol wines such as Moscato Asti which have not had their bouquet heavily influenced by other winemaking techniques like oak aging, autolysis with yeast, malolactic fermentation or fortification. However, this common \\"musky\\" (French: musqu√©) trait has caused some confusion as varieties that are wholly unrelated to the Muscat family are often erroneously associated with Muscat grapes (often by naming and synonyms) due to their aromatic character. These include the German wine grape Morio Muskat which, despite its name, is not related to the Muscat family and is, instead, a crossing of Silvaner x Pinot blanc. Likewise, the highly aromatic clonal mutation of several wine grape varieties such as Sauvignon blanc, Chasselas and Chardonnay are often suffixed with Musqu√© which can add confusion to their relationship with the Muscat family. Additionally, the Bordeaux wine grape Muscadelle that is used for both sweet and dry wines is often mistaken for a Muscat variety due to its aromatic qualities. While made from a more aromatically neutral grape, Melon de Bourgogne grape, the Loire wine Muscadet is sometimes mistakenly believed to be made from a member of the Muscat family. Lastly, the Muscat grape can be confused (in name only; the grapes themselves are quite different) with Vitis rotundifolia, which is commonly known as a \\"muscadine\\" grape.  Key varieties  The \\"Muscat family\\" is highly populous, with more than 200 distinct members. However, among these many different grapes only a handful of Muscat varieties are widely used in wine production. These include Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains, Muscat of Alexandria, Muscat of Scanzorosciate, Muscat of Hamburg and Muscat Ottonel. = Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains = In France, Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains is often used to produce fortified \\"Vin doux Naturel\\" dessert wines such as the Muscat de Saint-Jean de Minervois (left) and Muscat de Beaume de Venise (right) shown Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains is known by many names worldwide, including Muscat Blanc (white Muscat) in France and the United States), Muscat Canelli in the United States, Moscato Bianco (white Moscato) in Italy, Muscat Frontignan in South Africa, Moschato in Greece, Brown Muscat in Australia, Muskateller in Germany and Austria, Muscat de Grano Menudo in Spain, and Muscat de Frontignan and Muscat Lunel in France. While the \\"petits grains\\" in the grape's name accurately describes the small, round berries of the vine, some wine experts, such as Oz Clarke, believe that the term \\"Muscat blanc\\" is misleading, since the grapevine is notorious for its frequent color mutations siring clusters of berries in nearly every shade possible though most commonly the grape berries are a deep yellow after veraison. In some vineyards, vines of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains are known to produce clusters of berries of different colors that change every vintage.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pgs 146-153 Harcourt Books 2001 The precise origins of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains are not known, though Greece and Italy can both make compelling cases due to the proliferation of clones, mutations and offspring. Today, the grape is found throughout the wine-producing world, making a wide range of wine, from light, sweet sparkling and semi-sparkling Asti and Moscato d'Asti wine in the Piedmont wine region of Italy and Clairette de Die region of France, fortified vin doux naturels (VdN) in southern France in AOC regions such as Muscat de Beaume de Venise, Muscat de Saint-Jean de Minervois and Muscat de Frontignan, fortified Liqueur Muscat in the Rutherglen wine region in Australia, to dry wines in the Wachau wine of Austria and S√ºdsteiermark. Nearly all the most notable sweet Muscats of Greece, particularly those from the island of Samos and the city of Patras on the Peloponnese are made from Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains. In the history of South African wine, the famous dessert wine of Constantia was made from this variety of Muscat and while today Muscat of Alexandria is more widely planted in South Africa, producers around Constantia are trying to reclaim some of the region's viticultural acclaim by replanting more Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and making wines in the style of the original Constantia. = Muscat of Alexandria = The berries of Muscat of Alexandria clusters are larger and more oval-shaped than those of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains While the grape's name harkens to the city of Alexandria and suggest an ancient Egyptian origin, DNA analysis has shown that Muscat of Alexandria is the result of a natural crossing between Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and the Greek wine grape Axina de Tres Bias. Though as Axina de Tres Bias has also been historically grown in Sardinia and Malta, the precise location and origins of Muscat of Alexandria cannot be determined. Compared to Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains, Muscat of Alexandria tends to produce large, moderately loose clusters of large oval-shaped berries that are distinctive from the much smaller, round berries of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains. Like most Muscat varieties, Muscat of Alexandria is notable for being a desirable raisin and table grape. This is due in part to the grape's high tolerance of heat and drought conditions. While it is used in wine production (most notably on the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia, where it makes a passito style dessert wine under the name of \\"Zibibbo\\"), the grape lags far behind the reputation of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains. This is partly because Muscat of Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the monoterpene geraniol, which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of nerol which a more fresh, sweet rose aroma. In France, Muscat of Alexandria is most prominent as a blending component (with Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains) in the VdN wines of Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC in the Roussillon wine region. The grape is the primary Muscat variety in Spain, where it is known as Moscatel, though the majority of the country's plantings are used for table grapes and raisins, rather than for wine production. Likewise, in Chile, most of the Moscatel in that country is used to produce the distilled drink \\"pisco\\". In South Africa, Muscat of Alexandria is known as \\"Hanepoot\\" and was the fourth-most widely planted white wine grape variety in the country until the early 2000s. While some of the plantings were used for wine production, particularly for fortified wine, many plantings were used for the production of grape concentrate and raisins. In California, there is still more plantings of Muscat of Alexandria than any other Muscat variety, with most of these grapes going into anonymous jug wines from the Central Valley. As in many other places in the world, the grape had a long history of use in the United States as a raisin variety, though in the 1920s, plantings of Muscat of Alexandria began to decline as producers turned to more popular seedless grape varieties. = Muscat of Hamburg = Muscat of Hamburg from an 1895 German viticultural text Even though the vast majority of the members of the Muscat family are dark skinned grapes, most of the major varieties used in wine production are white or \\"pale skinned\\", with the one significant exception of Muscat of Hamburg, which is also known as Black Muscat. This dark-skinned grape is believed to have originated in the Victorian greenhouses of England, where it was first described in 1858 as being propagated by Seward Snow, gardener to the Earl de Grey. Snow described the grape as a seedling that he created from crossing the Black Hamburg grape (an old synonym of Schiava Grossa) with the White Muscat of Alexandria. In 2003, DNA analysis confirmed that Muscat of Hamburg was, indeed, a crossing of Muscat of Alexandria and Schiava Grossa, which makes the grape a full sibling to the central Italian grape Malvasia del Lazio which has the same parentage. While Muscat of Hamburg is used mostly as a table grape throughout the world, there are two notable exceptions. The first is in California, where nearly all of the of Black Muscat in cultivation in 2009 were destined for wine production, primarily to produce dessert wines. The other exception is in China, where Muscat of Hamburg is often crossed with Vitis amurensis species that are native to the region to produce wine grapes that are better adapted to the climate of various Chinese wine regions. = Muscat Ottonel = A bowl of table grapes that includes a mixture of Muscat Ottonel and Chasselas Rouge de Fonc√© Like Muscat of Hamburg, Muscat Ottonel is a relatively recent addition to the Muscat family, being bred in the Loire Valley wine region of France in the 1850s. The grape is a cross of the Swiss wine grape Chasselas and Muscat d'Eisenstadt (also known as Muscat de Saumur). Of all of the major Muscat varieties, Muscat Ottonel has the most pale skin color, and tends to produce the most neutral wines and is also the grape variety that ripens the earliest. While varieties such as Muscat of Alexandria tend to thrive in very warm Mediterranean climates, Muscat of Ottonel has shown an affinity for ripening in cooler continental climates, and has found a home in many Central European nations, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and many former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Ukraine. It is also the primary Muscat variety grown in the French region of Alsace, where it is used to produce both dry and off-dry styles. In Austria, it is also the most widely planted Muscat variety, where it is used to produce late-harvest wines around Lake Neusiedl.

In Greece, the grapes are usually known as \\"Moschato\\" or \\"Moschoudia\\", while in Italy, they are known as \\"Moscato\\" or \\"Moscatello\\". On the Iberian peninsula, Portuguese and Spanish Muscat grapes are often prefixed as \\"Moscatel\\", while in Germany, the grapes are usually known as \\"Muskat\\" or \\"Muskateller\\". In Central Europe, the family of Muscat varieties are known as \\"Misket\\" in Bulgaria and Turkey, \\"Mu≈°kat\\" in Croatia and \\"Muskatoly\\" or \\"Muskot√°ly\\" in Hungary.

The project was to use a Convair B-36 bomber as a testbed aircraft, and though one NB-36H was modified during the early stages of the project, the program was canceled before the actual X-6 and its nuclear reactor engines were completed. The X-6 was part of a larger series of programs, costing US$7 billion in all, that ran from 1946 through 1961. Because such an aircraft's range would not have been limited by liquid jet fuel, it was theorized that nuclear-powered strategic bombers would be able to stay airborne for weeks at a time. Development and design In May 1946, the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project was started by the Air Force. Studies under this program were done until May 1951 when NEPA was replaced by the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program. The ANP program included plans for Convair to modify two B-36s under the MX-1589 project. One of the B-36s was used to study shielding requirements for an airborne reactor, while the other became the X-6. =Nuclear Test Aircraft= The first modified B-36 was called the Nuclear Test Aircraft (NTA), a B-36H-20-CF (Serial Number 51-5712) that had been damaged in a tornado at Carswell AFB on September 1, 1952. This plane was redesignated the XB-36H, then the NB-36H and was modified to carry a 3 megawatt, air-cooled nuclear reactor in its bomb bay. The reactor, named the Aircraft Shield Test Reactor (ASTR), was operational but did not power the plane. Water, acting as both moderator and coolant, was pumped through the reactor core and then to water- to-air heat exchangers to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. Its sole purpose was to investigate the effect of radiation on aircraft systems. To shield the flight crew, the nose section of the aircraft was modified to include a 12-ton lead and rubber shield. The standard windshield was replaced with one made of acrylic glass. The amount of lead and water shielding was variable. Measurements of the resulting radiation levels were then compared with calculated levels to enhance the ability to design optimal shielding with minimum weight for nuclear-powered bombers. The NTA completed 47 test flights and 215 hours of flight time (during 89 of which the reactor was operated) between September 17, 1955, and March 1957 over New Mexico and Texas.. This was the only known airborne reactor experiment by the U.S. with an operational nuclear reactor on board. The NB-36H was scrapped at Fort Worth in 1958 when the Nuclear Aircraft Program was abandoned. After the ASTR was removed from the NB-36H, it was moved to the National Aircraft Research Facility. Based on the results of the NTA, the X-6 and the entire nuclear aircraft program was abandoned in 1961. =Development plans= Experimental Breeder Reactor I in Idaho, the first power reactor. The reactor is in the building top right, the two structures lower left are reactors from the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project Had the program progressed, follow-on aircraft would have been based on the successor to the B-36, Convair's swept-wing B-60.. The X-6 would have been powered by General Electric X-39 engines (J47 engines modified to use nuclear energy as fuel), utilizing a P-1 reactor.. In a nuclear jet engine, the reactor core was used as a heat source for the turbine's air flow, instead of burning jet fuel. One disadvantage of the design was that, since the airflow through the engine was used to cool the reactor, this airflow had to be maintained even after the aircraft had landed and parked. GE built two prototype engines, which can be seen outside the Experimental Breeder Reactor I in Arco, Idaho. A large, wide hangar was built at Test Area North, part of the National Reactor Testing Station (now part of the Idaho National Laboratory; Monteview) to house the X-6 project, but the project was cancelled before the planned runway was built, necessitated by the expected weight of the nuclear-powered aircraft. =Soviet program= In the 1960s, the Soviet Union's Tupolev design bureau had its own design for an experimental nuclear- powered aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-119, which was a Tu-95 bomber with two of its conventional turboprops replaced by nuclear-powered turboprops.

According to the IETF web site, the standard has been withdrawn and never made RFC status. However, Microsoft did at one time recommend DIME for transmitting files via Web services. It was also used in Java EE, but differences in the implementation of the protocol made it difficult. The first version was submitted to the IETF in November 2001; the last update was submitted in June 2002. By December 2003, DIME had lost out, in competition with Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism and SOAP with Attachments. Microsoft now describes DIME as \\"superseded by the SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) specification\\" The standard was intended to be an improved version of MIME.http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en- us/dnservice/html/service01152002.asp In particular a difficulty with MIME is that each message must be encoded as text and that its sections are separated by a separator given in the message header. This means the entire stream of data must be known to the sender before starting the communication, so as to choose a separator that does not occur in the data. This is not useful if the entire stream is not available when the communication is initiated, or when searching it is expensive. DIME is more oriented to streaming, allowing, for example, a receiver to process chunks of the message as they arrive without having to wait for the entire message. Problems with the HTTP DIME was defined the transmission format at the data link layer in the OSI model although it was typically transmitted over HTTP. One difficulty here was that it could form an HTTP message of, essentially, any size (the limit being the size information for each chunk, which was 32 bits so 1 gigabit). Many HTTP receivers were unused to messages as large as this, and if they buffered messages would simply fail, expecting a short message and receiving a huge one. Moreover, if the HTTP receiver was secured, it would, on receiving the message, send back a challenge message (400 code) to the sender. Because HTTP is connectionless, it would then entirely lose the possibly huge amount of data that had been sent to it, just to accept or deny the challenge. There was no entirely satisfactory solution to this. The response to the challenge could of course succeed, at the expense of sending the data twice, which if it were huge rather defeats its point. (It is fair to say any other method of sending data over HTTP suffers the same problem.) In the alternate, and probably better solution, the criteria for a successful challenge (e.g. a username and password) is established out-of-band, so it can be sent with the message the first time and not receive a challenge (the by-product of the connectionless HTTP protocol being that since each message is treated individual, any message must be able successfully to include its challenge response). DIME was extremely fast compared to practical applications of other protocols. Because the data was binary rather than, say, Base64 encoded, it was relatively compact, and the chunking and packet methods built into the protocol meant it could be streamed and read by a suitable receiver before the whole message had been read. Problems at the network layer Because DIME was defined at the data link layer, it was possible to encapsulate a DIME message in another DIME message. This would not help at all for compression purposes, but was occasionally useful to bypass networking infrastructure such as routers at the network layer of the OS model, that would otherwise block the encapsulated traffic (being binary they may treat it with suspicion). That being said, other protocols such as MIME may equally suffer such. Since DIME was generally used between well-trusted clients, a specific port could be opened at the router for the express purpose of sending and receiving DIME traffic. This did not subvert the security aspects, since the challenge would still occur, merely that it accepted that binary traffic was the norm on that port, and not give numerous false positives.

Such solutions are commonly used in scientific and engineering settings. Modern programming languages that support array programming (also known as vector or multidimensional languages) have been engineered specifically to generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher- dimensional arrays. These include APL, J, Fortran 90, Mata, MATLAB, Analytica, TK Solver (as lists), Octave, R, Cilk Plus, Julia, Perl Data Language (PDL), Wolfram Language, and the NumPy extension to Python. In these languages, an operation that operates on entire arrays can be called a vectorized operation, regardless of whether it is executed on a vector processor (which implements vector instructions) or not. Array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation. The level of concision can be dramatic in certain cases: it is not uncommon to find array programming language one- liners that require more than a couple of pages of object-oriented code. Concepts of array The fundamental idea behind array programming is that operations apply at once to an entire set of values. This makes it a high- level programming model as it allows the programmer to think and operate on whole aggregates of data, without having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations. Kenneth E. Iverson described the rationale behind array programming (actually referring to APL) as follows: The basis behind array programming and thinking is to find and exploit the properties of data where individual elements are similar or adjacent. Unlike object orientation which implicitly breaks down data to its constituent parts (or scalar quantities), array orientation looks to group data and apply a uniform handling. Function rank is an important concept to array programming languages in general, by analogy to tensor rank in mathematics: functions that operate on data may be classified by the number of dimensions they act on. Ordinary multiplication, for example, is a scalar ranked function because it operates on zero-dimensional data (individual numbers). The cross product operation is an example of a vector rank function because it operates on vectors, not scalars. Matrix multiplication is an example of a 2-rank function, because it operates on 2-dimensional objects (matrices). Collapse operators reduce the dimensionality of an input data array by one or more dimensions. For example, summing over elements collapses the input array by 1 dimension. Uses Array programming is very well suited to implicit parallelization; a topic of much research nowadays. Further, Intel and compatible CPUs developed and produced after 1997 contained various instruction set extensions, starting from MMX and continuing through SSSE3 and 3DNow!, which include rudimentary SIMD array capabilities. Array processing is distinct from parallel processing in that one physical processor performs operations on a group of items simultaneously while parallel processing aims to split a larger problem into smaller ones (MIMD) to be solved piecemeal by numerous processors. Processors with two or more cores are increasingly common today. Languages The canonical examples of array programming languages are Fortran, APL, and J. Others include: A+, Analytica, Chapel, IDL, Julia, K, Klong, Q, Mata, Wolfram Language, MATLAB, MOLSF, NumPy, GNU Octave, PDL, R, S-Lang, SAC, Nial, ZPL and TI-BASIC. =Scalar languages= In scalar languages such as C and Pascal, operations apply only to single values, so a+b expresses the addition of two numbers. In such languages, adding one array to another requires indexing and looping, the coding of which is tedious. for (i = 0; i < n; i++) for (j = 0; j < n; j++) a[i][j] += b[i][j]; In array-based languages, for example in Fortran, the nested for-loop above can be written in array-format in one line, a = a + b or alternatively, to emphasize the array nature of the objects, a(:,:) = a(:,:) + b(:,:) =Array languages= In array languages, operations are generalized to apply to both scalars and arrays. Thus, a+b expresses the sum of two scalars if a and b are scalars, or the sum of two arrays if they are arrays. An array language simplifies programming but possibly at a cost known as the abstraction penalty. Because the additions are performed in isolation from the rest of the coding, they may not produce the optimally most efficient code. (For example, additions of other elements of the same array may be subsequently encountered during the same execution, causing unnecessary repeated lookups.) Even the most sophisticated optimizing compiler would have an extremely hard time amalgamating two or more apparently disparate functions which might appear in different program sections or sub-routines, even though a programmer could do this easily, aggregating sums on the same pass over the array to minimize overhead). Ada The previous C code would become the following in the Ada language,Ada Reference Manual: G.3.1 Real Vectors and Matrices which supports array-programming syntax. A := A + B; APL APL uses single character Unicode symbols with no syntactic sugar. A ‚Üê A + B This operation works on arrays of any rank (including rank 0), and on a scalar and an array. Dyalog APL extends the original language with augmented assignments: A +‚Üê B Analytica Analytica provides the same economy of expression as Ada. A := A + B; BASIC Dartmouth BASIC had MAT statements for matrix and array manipulation in its third edition (1966). DIM A(4),B(4),C(4) MAT A = 1 MAT B = 2 * A MAT C = A + B MAT PRINT A,B,C Mata Stata's matrix programming language Mata supports array programming. Below, we illustrate addition, multiplication, addition of a matrix and a scalar, element by element multiplication, subscripting, and one of Mata's many inverse matrix functions. . end MATLAB The implementation in MATLAB allows the same economy allowed by using the Fortran language. A = A + B; A variant of the MATLAB language is the GNU Octave language, which extends the original language with augmented assignments: A += B; Both MATLAB and GNU Octave natively support linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and the numerical solution of system of linear equations, even using the Moore‚ÄìPenrose pseudoinverse. The Nial example of the inner product of two arrays can be implemented using the native matrix multiplication operator. If \`a\` is a row vector of size [1 n] and \`b\` is a corresponding column vector of size [n 1]. a * b; The inner product between two matrices having the same number of elements can be implemented with the auxiliary operator \`(:)\`, which reshapes a given matrix into a column vector, and the transpose operator \`'\`: A(:)' * B(:); rasql The rasdaman query language is a database-oriented array- programming language. For example, two arrays could be added with the following query: SELECT A + B FROM A, B R The R language supports array paradigm by default. The following example illustrates a process of multiplication of two matrices followed by an addition of a scalar (which is, in fact, a one-element vector) and a vector: > A <\\\\- matrix(1:6, nrow=2) !!this has nrow=2 ... and A has 2 rows > A [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 3 5 [2,] 2 4 6 > B <\\\\- t( matrix(6:1, nrow=2) ) # t() is a transpose operator !!this has nrow=2 ... and B has 3 rows --- a clear contradiction to the definition of A > B [,1] [,2] [1,] 6 5 [2,] 4 3 [3,] 2 1 > C <\\\\- A %*% B > C [,1] [,2] [1,] 28 19 [2,] 40 28 > D <\\\\- C + 1 > D [,1] [,2] [1,] 29 20 [2,] 41 29 > D + c(1, 1) # c() creates a vector [,1] [,2] [1,] 30 21 [2,] 42 30 Mathematical reasoning and language notation The matrix left-division operator concisely expresses some semantic properties of matrices. As in the scalar equivalent, if the (determinant of the) coefficient (matrix) \`A\` is not null then it is possible to solve the (vectorial) equation \`A * x = b\` by left-multiplying both sides by the inverse of \`A\`: \`A‚àí1\` (in both MATLAB and GNU Octave languages: \`A^-1\`). The following mathematical statements hold when \`A\` is a full rank square matrix: :\`A^-1 *(A * x)A^-1 * (b)\` :\`(A^-1 * A)* x A^-1 * b \` (matrix-multiplication associativity) :\`x = A^-1 * b\` where \`\` is the equivalence relational operator. The previous statements are also valid MATLAB expressions if the third one is executed before the others (numerical comparisons may be false because of round-off errors). If the system is overdetermined - so that \`A\` has more rows than columns - the pseudoinverse \`A+\` (in MATLAB and GNU Octave languages: \`pinv(A)\`) can replace the inverse \`A‚àí1\`, as follows: :\`pinv(A) *(A * x)pinv(A) * (b)\` :\`(pinv(A) * A)* x pinv(A) * b\` (matrix- multiplication associativity) :\`x = pinv(A) * b\` However, these solutions are neither the most concise ones (e.g. still remains the need to notationally differentiate overdetermined systems) nor the most computationally efficient. The latter point is easy to understand when considering again the scalar equivalent \`a * x = b\`, for which the solution \`x = a^-1 * b\` would require two operations instead of the more efficient \`x = b / a\`. The problem is that generally matrix multiplications are not commutative as the extension of the scalar solution to the matrix case would require: :\`(a * x)/ a b / a\` :\`(x * a)/ a b / a\` (commutativity does not hold for matrices!) :\`x * (a / a)b / a\` (associativity also holds for matrices) :\`x = b / a\` The MATLAB language introduces the left-division operator \`\\\\\` to maintain the essential part of the analogy with the scalar case, therefore simplifying the mathematical reasoning and preserving the conciseness: :\`A \\\\ (A * x)A \\\\ b\` :\`(A \\\\ A)* x A \\\\ b\` (associativity also holds for matrices, commutativity is no more required) :\`x = A \\\\ b\` This is not only an example of terse array programming from the coding point of view but also from the computational efficiency perspective, which in several array programming languages benefits from quite efficient linear algebra libraries such as ATLAS or LAPACK. Returning to the previous quotation of Iverson, the rationale behind it should now be evident: Third-party libraries The use of specialized and efficient libraries to provide more terse abstractions is also common in other programming languages. In C++ several linear algebra libraries exploit the language's ability to overload operators. In some cases a very terse abstraction in those languages is explicitly influenced by the array programming paradigm, as the Armadillo and Blitz++ libraries do.

Kyle of Lochalsh is the mainland connecting point of the Skye Bridge, with Kyleakin on the Isle of Skye being at the opposite side of the bridge. History A public hall in the centre of the village was completed in 1932. Kyle of Lochalsh was the departure point, on New Year's Eve 1918, of the HMY Iolaire, which was bringing home soldiers returning from World War I to the Outer Hebrides. It sank close to its destination of Stornoway and the soldiers tragically drowned. During the 1990s, residents and workers in the area of Kyle of Lochalsh joined together with residents and workers on the Isle of Skye to form the SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls) anti-toll group movement, to protest against the Skye bridge tolls, which at the time were the highest in the country (GBP 5 per crossing). The protestors were successful in having tolls abolished on the Skye Bridge. Transport Kyle of Lochalsh railway station is connected to Inverness by the Kyle of Lochalsh railway line, built in 1897 to improve public transport to the north-west of Scotland. The line ends on the water's edge, near where the ferry connection used to run. Kyle of Lochalsh is the end of the line for the Royal Scotsman service.

It was Seattle's only all- sports talk radio station until 710 KIRO affiliated itself with ESPN. KJR is now the Puget Sound region's home of Fox Sports Radio and NBC Sports Radio, and the station, mainly during Seahawks season, uses the slogan \\"Home of the 12th Man\\". KJR's transmitter site is on Vashon Island, and operates from its studios in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood northwest of downtown. KJR is one of the oldest radio stations in the United States. Its first license was issued in March 1922, however, it traces its lineage to broadcasts made by a predecessor station operating under an experimental license beginning in 1920. History =7AC/7XC= KJR's first formal broadcasting license was issued on March 9, 1922. However, the station's origin dates back to earlier broadcasts conducted by the station's first owner, Vincent I. Kraft. Beginning in 1917, Kraft was the director of the local Y.M.C.A. School of Radio Telegraphy,\\"Radio News: Leaves Y. M. C. A. School\\", Seattle Daily Times, March 1, 1922, page 5. and in early 1920 he and O. A. Dodson organized the Northwest Radio Service Company. Details on Kraft's earliest broadcasting efforts are limited, however, in August of that year he began an irregular series of broadcasts originating from his Cowen Park home at 5503 14th Avenue, N.E.,\\"Three Broadcasters Busy\\", Seattle Daily Times, February 28, 1922, page 5. over his amateur station, 7AC.\\"Amateur Radio Stations: Seventh District\\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States (edition June 30, 1920), page 77. The \\"7\\" in 7AC's call sign indicated that the station was in the 7th Radio Inspection district, while the fact that the \\"A\\" was in the range A-W specified that the station was operating under a standard Amateur Station license. Later that year Kraft was issued a license for an Experimental station, with the call sign 7XC.\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1920, page 5. The \\"X\\" in 7XC's call sign indicated that the station held an Experimental license. In early September 1921 he began transmitting programs on a regular schedule, consisting of broadcasts three evenings a week from 7:45-8:30 p.m. In early February 1922, Kraft built a radio transmitter used by a temporary station, KDP, to broadcast a week-long series of programs from Saint James' Cathedral.KDP reports in the Seattle Times (January 29, 1922‚ÄîFebruary 15, 1922) Following these broadcasts he began using the KDP transmitter at 7XC.\\"Radio News\\", Seattle Daily Times, February 17, 1922, page 8. On February 28, 1922 he resigned his Y.M.C.A. post in order to assume active management of Northwest Radio. =KJR= The Northwest Radio Service Company sold radio equipment in addition to founding KJR (1922)Northwest Radio Service Company (advertisement), Seattle Post- Intelligencer, May 17, 1922, page 14. Initially there were no specific standards for stations making broadcasts intended for the general public, and radio stations holding a variety of license classes, most commonly Experimental and Amateur, began adopting regular broadcasting schedules. On December 1, 1921 the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted a regulation formally establishing a broadcasting station category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment broadcasts, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for market and weather reports.\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. A few months later Kraft applied for one of the new broadcasting licenses, which was issued on March 9, 1922 with the randomly assigned call letters KJR, for operation on both 360 and 485 meters.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1922, page 4. Limited Commercial license, issued March 9, 1922 to Vincent I. Kraft in Seattle, Washington for operation on 360 and 485 meters for a three months period. It had been initially reported that the station's new call sign was \\"KAJR\\",\\"Gets Federal Station Call\\", Seattle Daily Times, March 15, 1922, page 8. however this turned out to be an error in a telegram sent by the Commerce Department, and shortly thereafter it was correctly reported that the assignment was actually \\"KJR\\".\\"Wireless Laughs at Wire\\", Seattle Daily Times, March 18, 1922, page 5. Later in 1922 KJR's licensee was changed to \\"Northwest Radio Service Co. (Vincent I.

KJR was the third license issued for a Seattle broadcasting station, preceded by KFC (Northern Radio & Electric, licensed December 8, 1921 and deleted January 23, 1923) and KHQ (Louis Wasmer, licensed February 28, 1922, later moved to Spokane-now KQNT). Despite this, KJR claimed to have the oldest broadcasting lineage, by including the earlier 7XC activities as part of its history. Because there was only the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters available for use by multiple stations, each region had to set up a timesharing agreement to allocate timeslots. On June 23, 1922 three Seattle stations took turns operating from noon to 10:30 p.m., with KJR allocated 8:15 to 9:15 p.m.\\"Radio Broadcasts\\", Seattle Star, June 23, 1922, page 2. In May 1923 the Department of Commerce set aside an additional band of transmitting frequencies,\\"Amendments to Regulations, Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, May 1, 1923, page 12. and KJR was assigned to one of the lower power \\"Class A\\" frequencies, 1110 kHz,\\"Alterations and Corrections: Broadcasting Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1923, page 10. which was modified a short time later to 1060 kHz. In early 1925 the station transferred to one of the high power \\"Class B\\" frequencies, 780 kHz,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\" Radio Service Bulletin, February 2, 1925, page 8. and in 1927 the station was shifted again, to 860 kHz. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, KJR was reassigned to a high-powered \\"clear channel\\" frequency of 970 kHz.\\"Broadcasting Stations, by Wave Lengths, Effective November 11, 1928\\", Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the U.S. (Edition June 30, 1928), page 173. KJR was originally located at the Times Square Building in downtown Seattle. In 1925, it moved to the Terminal Sales Building, where Kraft had erected a 50-foot (15 meter) mast to serve as the station's antenna, which was soon superseded by a new, T-wire antenna built in North City near Lake Forest Park completed in 1927 (later the site of Saint Mark's Catholic Church), at which point the studios were moved to the Home Savings Building at 1520 Westlake Ave.\\"KJR Expands Service\\", The Seattle Times, December 24, 1924, p. 3.John F.

KJR was then acquired by NBC,Schneider, op. cit., pp. 33, 38, 41. which in 1933 leased the station to the Fisher family-owned Fisher's Blend Station, Inc., owners of KOMO radio, who moved the KJR studios to the Skinner Building.\\"Federal Radio Commission\\" (Decisions: February 14, 1933), Broadcasting, March 1, 1933, page 32.

Gary \\"Lockjock\\" Lockwood, a.k.a. L.J., was the disk jockey who had the longest tenure on the \\"Mighty Channel 95,\\" from 1976-1991. Sports KJR served as the home of the Seattle SuperSonics from 1987‚Äì2006. Since the 2006-2007 season, ISP Sports was the media rights holder for Husky athletics until IMG College took over. KJR was the Washington IMG College Network's flagship station from 2002-2014. (KJR has since lost the broadcast rights back to KOMO.) KJR carried some play-by-play from ESPN Radio, and some of the regular talk shows at night and during weekends. In 2002, Seattle Mariners relief pitcher Jeff Nelson had surgery to remove bone chips from his pitching elbow. During his weekly show with Dave \\"Softy\\" Mahler, Nelson announced he would attempt to sell his bone chips on eBay. After earning bids as high as $23,600, eBay pulled the chips from auction for violating the site's policy of not selling body parts. In 2003, Seattle Storm point guard Sue Bird made a bet with morning host Mitch Levy that gained national publicity. The bet was over Bird's season assist/turnover ratio. If the ratio finished higher that 3:1, Bird agreed to be spanked by Levy on the air. If Bird won the bet, Levy agreed to purchase Storm season tickets. The bet was later amended to include Bird yelling \\"Harder, Daddy, Harder.\\" The bet was ultimately called off by Bird. When asked at a later date, Tyler Orsborn (morning show producer at the time) suggested that Storm management were the real reason the bet was called off and not Bird. During a 2006 radio interview with Dave \\"Softy\\" Mahler and former University of Washington quarterback Hugh Millen, then-Atlanta Falcons head coach Jim L. Mora said he'd be in the \\"friggin' head of the line\\" for the Washington Huskies football head coaching position, if it became available. Mora, who played for the University of Washington, later said he was only kidding during the interview, but was still fired by the Falcons at the end of the season. He would later coach the Seattle Seahawks for one season in 2009. Host \\"Softy\\" began a feud with another sports show host in Salt Lake City, Utah after they argued about their predicted outcomes of the Washington vs. BYU game on September 5, 2008. After arguing with Hans Olsen of Sports Radio 1280 The Zone, Softy had an on-air meltdown where he claimed that he was going to choke Hans and repeatedly called him an idiot. On August 26, 2017, KJR morning host Mitch Levy was arrested in connection with a prostitution sting. iHeartMedia has not issued a public statement on the matter. On October 6, Levy announced he would exit from the station after 23 years.\\"Mitch Levy Exits KJR Seattle Following Prostitution Sting Arrest\\" by Lance Venta, October 6, 2017 (radioinsight.com) As of the 2018 Major League Soccer season, KJR is the English-speaking broadcast partner for Seattle Sounders FC with Matt Johnson on the call.

He played 12 years in Major League Baseball, as a shortstop (657 games), catcher (298 games), and outfielder (103 games), for four major league clubs. His longest stretches were in the National League with the Buffalo Bisons (1879‚Äì1885) and Detroit Wolverines (1886‚Äì1888). He was also a player-manager and part owner of the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League in 1890, and the manager of the Buffalo Bisons (Eastern League) from 1896 to 1898. Rowe appeared in 1,044 major league games, compiled a .286 batting average and .392 slugging percentage, and totaled 764 runs scored, 1,256 hits, 202 doubles, 88 triples, 28 home runs, and 644 RBIs. From 1881 to 1888, he was part of the \\"Big Four\\", a group of renowned batters (the others being Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, and Deacon White) who played together in Buffalo and Detroit and led Detroit to the National League pennant and 1887 World Series championship. Early years Rowe was born in Cold Spring Township, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, in 1856. His older brother, Dave Rowe, also played and managed in the major leagues between 1877 to 1888. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= At age 19, Rowe began his career in organized baseball in 1876 with a club in Jacksonville, Illinois. In 1877, he played for the Milwaukee club in the League Alliance. He also played in 1877 and/or 1878 under Tom Loftus with the Peoria Reds. In 1879, Rowe and his brother, Dave Rowe, signed with the Rockford, Illinois team in the Northwestern League. At Rockford, Rowe earned a reputation as a hitter and \\"one of the best bare-handed catchers in the game.\\" =Buffalo Bisons= After the Northwestern League folded in early July 1878, Rowe signed with the Buffalo Bisons of the National League. He made his major league debut on September 6, 1879, at age 22, and played in eight games for Buffalo that season, batting .353 in 38 plate appearances. Rowe remained with Buffalo for seven years from 1879 to 1885. During the 1879 to 1884 seasons, Rowe was principally a catcher, appearing in 272 games at that position, 91 games as an outfielder, 55 as a shortstop and 20 at third base. In 1881, he compiled a .333 batting average and led the National League with 11 triples. Two of Rowe's triples came in one game against the Chicago White Stockings on August 16, 1881. His .480 slugging percentage in 1881 was the third highest in the league, and his 2.8 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating was the fifth highest among the league's position players. In 1882, he registered a 2.7 WAR rating and did not strike out even once in 329 plate appearances. Rowe was one of four Buffalo players (with Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, and Deacon White) who became known as the \\"Big Four.\\" The \\"Big Four\\" were \\"regarded for many years as the greatest quartette (sic) in the history of the national pastime.\\" During the 1884 season, the \\"Big Four\\" led Buffalo to a third place finish and a 64‚Äì47 (.577) record ‚Äì the highest winning percentage in the club's history. Rowe registered a career high 4.6 WAR rating in 1884 and ranked among the league leaders with 14 triples (3rd), a .450 slugging percentage (9th) and a .352 on-base percentage (10th). He also led the National League's catchers in 1884 with a .943 fielding percentage. In 1885, Rowe transitioned from a catcher to a shortstop, catching 23 games and playing shortstop in 65 games. Despite the strong bats of the \\"Big Four\\" (the \\"Big Four\\" combined for a .315 batting average in 1885), the Bisons had the worst pitching in the National League with a 4.28 earned run average (ERA), far above the league average of 2.82 ERA. The team finished in seventh place with a 38-74 record. The Bisons left the National League after the 1885 season. =Detroit Wolverines= 1887 Detroit Wolverines In September 1885, the \\"Big Four\\" were sold by Buffalo to the Detroit Wolverines. All four remained with the Wolverines for three seasons, until the team disbanded after the 1888 season. During the 1886 season, Rowe appeared in 111 games and was Detroit's starting shortstop. He also appeared in three games as a catcher. He compiled a 4.2 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating during the 1886 season, the eighth highest rating among all position players in the National League. As a batter, he hit for .303 average and ranked among the league leaders with a 4.0 Offensive WAR rating (10th), 97 runs scored (10th) and 199 total bases (10th). On June 12, 1886, the Wolverines set a major league record with seven home runs in a game, with Rowe and Sam Thompson each hitting two. (The record stood until 1939.) He also hit for the cycle on August 21, 1886, in an 18‚Äì14 loss to the Chicago White Stockings. Defensively, he also ranked among the league leaders with a 1.0 Defensive WAR rating (7th) and 310 assists at shortstop (5th). With the addition of the \\"Big Four\\", the Wolverines improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85-38 record. The 1887 season was the pinnacle in the history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. Rowe was the starting shortstop for the 1887 team, appearing in 124 games at the position, and continuing to rank among the best players in the National League. Rowe hit for a .318 average, and his 4.1 WAR rating ranked as the 10th highest among the league's position players. He further ranked among the league leaders with 135 runs scored (2nd), 30 doubles (7th) and 239 total bases (9th). He also had another solid year defensively, finishing with the fifth highest Defensive WAR rating (1.1) in the league, ranking second among the league's shortstops with a .907 fielding percentage, and ranking third with 378 assists at shortstop. Rowe also played well in the postseason, scoring 12 runs and stealing five bases in the 1887 World Series. During the 1888 season, the Wolverines finished in fifth place with a 68‚Äì63 record. Rowe continued to play well with a 2.6 WAR rating in 105 games as the Wolverines' shortstop. However, he committed a career high 72 errors, the second highest total in the National League by any player at any position. With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines sold Rowe and Pete Conway to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. =Pittsburgh= Rowe initially refused to recognize the validity of his sale to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. In December 1888, Rowe and Deacon White purchased interests in the Buffalo baseball club, deciding they would prefer to return to Buffalo as co-owners, managers, and players. William Nimick, the Alleghenys' owner, refused to release Rowe and White, reportedly saying, \\"If they don't want to play in Pittsburgh, they'll play nowhere.\\" In July 1888, Rowe and White agreed to play for Pittsburgh. He appeared in 75 games as the Alleghenys' shortstop, but his batting average dropped to .259. =Players' League= In 1890, Rowe concluded his playing career as a player, manager, and owner of the Buffalo Bisons in the newly organized Players' League. Rowe and Deacon White owned the club. Rowe appeared in 125 games as the shortstop and saw his batting average drop to .250. Defensively, he led the Players' League shortstops with a .901 fielding percentage. He appeared in his last major league game on October 5, 1890. As the team's manager, he compiled a 27-72 (.273) record. The Players' League collapsed after the 1890 season, but Rowe and White sold the Buffalo club and grounds to \\"some Buffalo capitalists\\" for $2,500 in stock and $8,000 in cash. In 1891, The Sporting Life wrote that, having sold for a profit before the league's collapse, \\"Rowe and White are pretty slick, you bet.\\" =Return to minors= Although Rowe did not return to the major leagues, he continued to play minor league baseball through the 1893 season. He played in 1891 for the Lincoln Rustlers of the Western Association. Rowe was reunited with his brother, Dave Rowe, who was manager of the Lincoln club. Rowe concluded his playing career back in Buffalo, playing for the Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern League. In his last season of organized baseball, Rowe, at age 36, continued to hit well. In 110 games for the 1893 Bisons, Rowe compiled a .349 batting average and .456 slugging percentage with 113 runs scored, 22 doubles, nine triples, three home runs and 18 stolen bases. =Manager at Buffalo= In November 1895, after two years out of the sport, Rowe was hired to manage the Buffalo Bisons (Eastern League) for the 1896 season. At the time, The Sporting Life wrote: \\"Rowe is a resident of Buffalo and has lived in this city with his family for many years. He is well known in local base ball circles, and, for that matter, his is a familiar name in connection with the history of the game all over the country.\\" Rowe managed the Bisons from 1896 to 1898. As the Bisons' manager, he developed several major league players, including Claude Ritchey, Chick Stahl, Harry Smith and Jack Barry. In 1897, Rowe had an all red-headed outfield at Buffalo that inspired Zane Grey's 1922 story, \\"The Red-Headed Outfield\\". Later years After retiring from baseball, Rowe operated a cigar store in Buffalo. His store was reportedly \\"a popular gathering place for sporting figures of the city.\\"A 1900 U.S. Census entry registers a John Rowe, cigar dealer, born in Pennsylvania, and living at 650 Elmwood in Buffalo with his wife, Louise, son, Harry, and daughters, Mabel, Helen and Louise. This appears to be Jack Rowe except for the fact that his month of birth was listed as November 1857, rather than December 1856.

In January 1899, The Sporting Life described him as \\"one of the most contented men in Buffalo these days\\", attending to his cigar business, and \\"ever ready to talk base ball.\\" Rowe became ill in 1910 and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to live with his daughter, Helen. Rowe died in April 1911 at his daughter's residence in St. Louis at age 55. His cause of death has been reported as aortic regurgitation and nephritis.

He is best known for his research in climatology, his 1988 Congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming, and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change. In recent years he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of global warming, on a few occasions leading to his arrest. Early life and education Hansen was born in Denison, Iowa, to James Ivan Hansen and Gladys Ray Hansen.Charles Sherwin Shene and Donna Hansen Stene, The Hansen Family, Decorah, IA, 2009, 56-57. He was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. He obtained a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics with highest distinction in 1963, an M.S. in Astronomy in 1965 and a Ph.D. in Physics in 1967, all three degrees from the University of Iowa. He participated in the NASA graduate traineeship from 1962 to 1966 and, at the same time, between 1965 and 1966, he was a visiting student at the Institute of Astrophysics at the University of Kyoto and in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo. He then began work at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in 1967. Career After graduate school, Hansen continued his work with radiative transfer models, attempting to understand the Venusian atmosphere. He later applied and refined these models to understand the Earth's atmosphere, and in particular, the effects that aerosols and trace gases have on Earth's climate. His development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the Earth's climate. In 2009 his first book, Storms of My Grandchildren, was published. In 2012 he presented the TED Talk \\"Why I must speak out about climate change\\". From 1981 to 2013, he was the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center. , Hansen directs the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions at Columbia University's Earth Institute. The program is working to continue to \\"connect the dots\\" from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions. Hansen is representing his granddaughter as well as \\"future generations\\" as plaintiffs in the Juliana v. United States lawsuit, which is suing the United States government and some of its executive branch's positions for not protecting a stable climate system. Research and publications As a college student at the University of Iowa, Hansen was attracted to science and the research done by James Van Allen's space science program in the physics and astronomy department. A decade later, his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition. Hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres, especially the interpretation of remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere and surface from satellites. Because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe, they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change. His other interests include the development of global circulation models to help understand the observed climate trends, and diagnosing human impacts on climate. =Studies of Venus= thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and its clouds are sulfuric acid. The thickness of the atmosphere initially made it difficult to determine why the surface was so hot. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, following his Ph.D. dissertation, Hansen published several papers on the planet Venus. Venus has a high brightness temperature in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared. He proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet. More recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago, Venus's atmosphere was much more like Earth's than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere. Hansen continued his study of Venus by looking at the composition of its clouds. He looked at the near- infrared reflectivity of ice clouds, compared them to observations of Venus, and found that they qualitatively agreed. He also was able to use a radiative transfer model to establish an upper limit to the size of the ice particles if the clouds were actually made of ice. Evidence published in the early 1980s showed that the clouds consist mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets. By 1974, the composition of Venus' clouds had not yet been determined, with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds, including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride. Hansen and Hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a refractive index and cloud drop effective radius which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid. Kiyoshi Kawabata and Hansen expanded upon this work by looking at the variation of polarization on Venus. They found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud, confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun. The Pioneer Venus project was launched in May 1978 and reached Venus late that same year. Hansen collaborated with Larry Travis and other colleagues in a 1979 Science article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum. They concluded that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images: a thin haze layer, sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer. The linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low- and mid-level clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about 1 micrometer. Above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze. =Global temperature analysis= A typical automated airport weather station which records the routine hourly weather observations of temperature, weather type, wind, sky condition, and visibility. These surface stations are located around the world, and are used to derive a global temperature. The first NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) global temperature analysis was published in 1981. Hansen and his co-author analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from 1880 to 1985. Temperatures for stations closer together than 1000 kilometers were shown to be highly correlated, especially in the mid-latitudes, providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate long-term variations. They concluded that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the Northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions. Warming in the past century was found to be , with warming similar in both hemispheres. When the analysis was updated in 1988, the four warmest years on record were all in the 1980s. The two warmest years were 1981 and 1987. During a senate meeting on June 23, 1988, Hansen reported that he was ninety-nine percent certain the earth was warmer then than it had ever been measured to be, there was a clear cause and effect relationship with the greenhouse effect and lastly that due to global warming, the likelihood of freak weather was steadily increasing. With the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, 1992 saw a cooling in global temperatures. There was speculation that this would cause the next couple of years to be cooler because of the large serial correlation in the global temperatures. Bassett and Lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small. Hansen countered by saying that having insider information shifted the odds to those who know the physics of the climate system, and that whether there is a new temperature record depends upon the particular data set used. The temperature data was updated in 1999 to report that 1998 was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in 1880. They also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history, and concluded that the recent El Ni√±o was not solely responsible for the large temperature anomaly in 1998. In spite of this, the United States had seen a smaller degree of warming, and a region in the eastern U.S. and the western Atlantic Ocean had actually cooled slightly. 2001 saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated. It incorporated corrections due to the following reasons: time-of-observation bias; station history changes; classification of rural/urban station; the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity, and relying more on rural station than urban. Evidence was found of local urban warming in urban, suburban and small-town records. The anomalously high global temperature in 1998 due to El Ni√±o resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years. However, a 2001 Hansen report in the journal Science states that global warming continues, and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming. The temperature data was updated in 2006 to report that temperatures are now warmer than a century ago, and concluded that the recent global warming is a real climate change and not an artifact from the urban heat island effect. The regional variation of warming, with more warming in the higher latitudes, is further evidence of warming that is anthropogenic in origin. In 2007, Stephen McIntyre notified GISS that many of the U.S. temperature records from the Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) displayed a discontinuity around the year 2000. NASA corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited McIntyre with pointing out the flaw. Hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake. In 2010, Hansen published a paper entitled \\"Global Surface Temperature Change\\" describing current global temperature analysis. =Black carbon studies= The incomplete combustion of biomass during the Yellowstone fires of 1988 near the Snake River introduced a large quantity of black carbon particles into the atmosphere. Hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of black carbon on regional climate. In recent decades, northern China has experienced increased drought, and southern China has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods. Southern China has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed. In a paper with Menon and colleagues, through the use of observations and climate models results, they conclude that the black carbon heats the air, increases convection and precipitation, and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates. A year later, Hansen teamed with Makiko Sato to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of AERONET sun photometers. While the location of the AERONET instruments did not represent a global sample, they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies. They found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least 2. This corresponds to an increase in the climate forcing of around , which they hypothesize is partially offset by the cooling of non-absorbing aerosols. Estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the 1880s after the start of the Industrial Revolution, and a leveling off from 1900‚Äì1950 as environmental laws were enacted. China and India have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development. The emissions from the United Kingdom were estimated using a network of stations that measured black smoke and sulfur dioxide. They report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the 1960s, and that the decline was faster than the decline in black-carbon-producing fuel use. A 2007 paper used the GISS climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic. Much of the arctic aerosol comes from south Asia. Countries such as the United States and Russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed. =Anthropogenic impact on climate= Hansen has warned that low-lying coastal areas such as Florida (seen here), East Anglia, the Netherlands, oceanic islands and Bangladesh are vulnerable to sea levels rising. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. In 2000, Hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last 100 years, arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via carbon dioxide () largely balanced each other out, and that the 0.74¬±0.18 ¬∞C net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons. However, even then he wrote \\"the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance of CO2 over aerosols\\". In 2003, Hansen wrote a paper called \\"Can We Defuse the Global Warming Time Bomb?\\" in which he argued that human-caused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones, and that this, over a long time period, can cause large climate changes. He further stated that a lower limit on \\"dangerous anthropogenic interference\\" was set by the stability of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. His view on actions to mitigate climate change was that \\"halting global warming requires urgent, unprecedented international cooperation, but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health, agriculture and the environment.\\" In a 2004 presentation at the University of Iowa, Hansen announced that he was told by high-ranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because it was not understood what 'dangerous' meant, or how humans were actually affecting climate. He described this as a Faustian bargain because atmospheric aerosols had health risks, and should be reduced, but doing so would effectively increase the warming effects from . Hansen and coauthors proposed that the global mean temperature was a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Two elements were identified as particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference: sea level rise and the extinction of species. They described a business-as-usual scenario, which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately 2% per year; and an alternate scenario, in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline. Under the alternate scenario, sea levels could rise by 1 meter per century, causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas. But this would be minor compared to the 10-meter increase in sea level under the business-as-usual scenario. Hansen described the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise. Assuming the alternate scenario, the situation would not be good, but it would be much worse for business as usual. The concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a 2007 paper, finding that further warming of 1 ¬∞C would be highly disruptive to humans. An alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below 3 ¬∞C for doubled . The conclusion was that levels above 450 ppm were considered dangerous, but that reduction in non- greenhouse gases could provide temporary relief from drastic cuts. Further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by non- constituents as much as by . The 2007 paper cautioned that prompt action is needed to slow growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference. =Climate model development and projections= A comparison of global surface temperature computed for three scenarios and compared with two analysis of observational data. Vilhelm Bjerknes began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early 20th century. The progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations. It wasn't until the 1950s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic. Hansen's first contribution to numerical climate models came with the 1974 publication of the GISS model. He and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sea-level pressure and 500mb heights in the North American region. A 1981 Science publication by Hansen and a team of scientists at Goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted. They used a one-dimensional radiative- convective model that calculates temperature as a function of height. They reported that the results from the 1D model are similar to those of the more complex 3D models, and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks. Hansen predicted that temperatures would rise out of the climate noise by the 1990s, much earlier than predicted by other researches. He also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react.\\"Experts Find Possible Climatic 'Bomb'\\", Eleanor Randolph, Staff writer, Los Angeles Times, August 9, 1981, pg B3 By the early 1980s, the computational speed of computers, along with refinements in climate models, allowed longer experiments. The models now included physics beyond the previous equations, such as convection schemes, diurnal changes, and snow-depth calculations. The advances in computational efficiency, combined with the added physics, meant the GISS model could be run for five years. It was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a grid-point resolution as coarse as 1000 kilometers. The first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by Hansen was in 1988, the same year as his well-known Senate testimony. The second generation of the GISS model was used to estimate the change in mean surface temperature based on a variety of scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. Hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades, and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the Eemian. He argued that if the temperature rose above the 1950‚Äì1980 mean for a few years, it would be the \\"smoking gun\\" pointing to human-caused global warming. Hansen giving testimony before the United States Congress in 1988. In 2006, Hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by Hansen in his 1988 testimony before the United States Congress. They described the intermediate scenario as the most likely, and that real-world greenhouse gas forcing had been closest to this scenario. It contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fifty-year projections, with one in 1995, whereas the recent Mount Pinatubo eruption was in 1991. They found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios. The warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios were nearly the same through the year 2000, and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment. They did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the climate sensitivity used was higher than current estimates. A year later, Hansen joined with Rahmstorf and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations. The comparison was done from 1990 through January 2007 against physics-based models that are independent from the observations after 1990. They showed that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate. Rahmstorf and coauthors showed concern that sea levels are rising at the high range of the IPCC projections, and that this was due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets. Following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures, Roy Spencer and John Christy published the first version of their satellite temperature measurements in 1990. Contrary to climate models and surface measurements, their results showed a cooling in the troposphere. However, in 1998, Wentz and Schabel determined that orbital decay had an effect on the derived temperatures. Hansen compared the corrected troposphere temperatures with the results of the published GISS model, and concluded that the model is in good agreement with the observations, noting that the satellite temperature data had been the last holdout of global warming denialists, and that the correction of the data would result in a change from discussing whether global warming is occurring to what is the rate of global warming, and what should be done about it. Hansen has continued the development and diagnostics of climate models. For instance, he has helped in the investigations of the decadal trends in tropopause height, which could be a useful tool for determining the human \\"fingerprint\\" on climate. , the current version of the GISS model is Model E. This version has seen improvements in many areas, including upper-level winds, cloud height, and precipitation. This model still has problems with regions of marine stratocumulus clouds. A later paper showed that the model's main problems are having too weak of an ENSO-like variability, and poor sea ice modeling, resulting in too little ice in the Southern Hemisphere and too much in the Northern Hemisphere. =Climate forcings, feedbacks, and sensitivity= Estimated climate forcings between 1850 and 2000 In 2000 Hansen authored a paper called \\"Global warming in the twenty-first century: an alternative scenario\\" in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming, focusing on non-CO2 gases and black carbon in the short run, giving more time to make reductions in fossil fuel emissions. He notes that the net warming observed to date is roughly as big as that expected from non-CO2 gases only. This is because CO2 warming is offset by climate-cooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time non-CO2 gases, taken together, were responsible for roughly 50% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming. In a 2007 paper, Hansen discussed the potential danger of \\"fast- feedback\\" effects causing ice sheet disintegration, based on paleoclimate data. George Monbiot reports \\"The IPCC predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as this century. Hansen's paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects doesn't fit the data. The geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion, but flips suddenly from one state to another. When temperatures increased to 2‚Äì3¬∞C (3.6‚Äì5.4¬∞F) above today's level 3.5 million years ago, sea levels rose not by 59 centimeters but by . The ice responded immediately to changes in temperature.\\" Hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions. \\"It is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem ‚Ä¶ An ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable, and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.\\" He concludes that \\"present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of human-made [greenhouse gases]. However, it is much lower than has commonly been assumed. If we have not already passed the dangerous level, the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades.\\" In 2013, Hansen authored a paper called \\"Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide,\\" in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be (3¬±1)¬∞C based on Pleistocene paleoclimate data. The paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels \\"would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans.\\" In 2016, a team of 19 researchers led by Hansen published a paper \\"Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 ¬∞C global warming could be dangerous\\" describing the effect of meltwater from ice sheets on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (slowing it or even stopping) and Antarctic bottom water formation. This would speed up ice sheet melting and sea level rise by increasing the water temperature at hundreds of meters depth, thawing ice shelves from below. And the cool fresh meltwater on the ocean close to Greenland and Antarctica leads to larger temperature difference between tropics and middle latitudes, what would enable storms as strong as in the last interglacial, the Eemian, whose evidence includes, among others, megaboulders on Bahamas. Analysis of climate change causation Hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change, the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions, but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. By this measure, the U.K. is still the largest single cause of climate change, followed by the U.S. and Germany, even though its current emissions are surpassed by the People's Republic of China. On public policy, Hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change. He points specifically to the Competitive Enterprise Institute's commercials with the tagline \\"carbon dioxide‚Äîthey call it pollution, we call it life\\", and politicians who accept money from fossil-fuel interests and then describe global warming as \\"a great hoax.\\" He also says that changes needed to reduce global warming do not require hardship or reduction in the quality of life, but will also produce benefits such as cleaner air and water, and growth of high-tech industries. He was a critic of both the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations' stances on climate change. Addressing the potential effects of climate change, Hansen has stated in an interview in January 2009, \\"We cannot now afford to put off change any longer. We have to get on a new path within this new administration. We have only four years left for Obama to set an example to the rest of the world. America must take the lead.\\" Climate change activism = US Senate committee testimony = Hansen was invited by Rafe Pomerance to testify before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on June 23, 1988. Hansen testified that \\"Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming...It is already happening now\\" and \\"The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now...We already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important.\\" Hansen said that NASA was 99% confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation. According to science historian Spencer R. Weart, Hansen's testimony increased public awareness of climate change. According to Richard Besel of California Polytechnic State University, Hansen's testimony \\"was an important turning point in the history of global climate change.\\" According to Timothy M. O'Donnell of the University of Mary Washington, Hansen's testimony was \\"pivotal,\\" \\"ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate,\\" and marked \\"the official beginning of the global warming policy debate.\\" According to Roger A. Pielke of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Hansen's \\"call to action\\" \\"elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes, floods, and heat waves, to unprecedented levels of attention from the public, media, and policy makers.\\" =Criticism of coal industry= Hansen has been particularly critical of the coal industry, stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. He acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil. The difference is where the fuel originally resides. He says that most oil comes from Russia and Saudi Arabia, and that no matter how fuel-efficient automobiles become, the oil will eventually be burned and the emitted. In a 2007 testimony before the Iowa Utilities Board, he stated that the United States has a large reservoir of coal, which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by U.S. politicians, unlike oil which is controlled by other countries. He has called for phasing out coal power completely by the year 2030. During his testimony before the Iowa Utilities Board in 2007, Hansen likened coal trains to \\"death trains\\" and asserted that these would be \\"no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria, loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species.\\" In response, the National Mining Association stated that his comparison \\"trivialized the suffering of millions\\" and \\"undermined his credibility.\\"More from NASA's Hansen on coal Des Moines Register / Knight Science Journalism at MIT, November 7, 2007, Retrieved November 23, 2012 Citing the reactions of \\"several people\\" and \\"three of his scientific colleagues\\" as his primary motivation, Hansen stated that he certainly did not mean to trivialize suffering by the families who lost relatives in the Holocaust and then apologized, saying he regretted that his words caused pain to some readers. Mountaintop removal mining On June 23, 2009, James Hansen, along with 30 other protesters including actress Daryl Hannah, was arrested on misdemeanor charges of obstructing police and impeding traffic, during a protest against mountaintop removal mining in Raleigh County, West Virginia. The protesters intended to enter the property of Massey Energy Company, but were blocked by a crowd of several hundred coal miners and supporters. Hansen said that mountaintop removal for coal mining \\"[provides] only a small fraction of our energy\\" and \\"should be abolished.\\" Hansen called on President Barack Obama to abolish mountaintop coal mining. Hansen and about 100 other people were arrested in September 2010 in front of the White House in Washington, DC. The group was seeking a ban on mountaintop removal or surface mining. =Cap and trade= In 2009 Hansen spoke out against cap and trade, advocating instead what he believes would be a progressive carbon tax at source carbon as oil, gas or coal, with a 100% dividend returned to citizens in equal shares, as proposed by Citizens' Climate Lobby. He has made many appearances and talks supporting the work of CCL.James Hansen. Tell Barack Obama the Truth ‚Äì The Whole Truth. accessed December 10, 2009. =Retirement from NASA= Hansen retired from NASA in April 2013 after 46 years of government service, saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit greenhouse gases. The same month, the National Center for Science Education, an organization noted for defending the teaching of evolution in United States science classrooms, named Hansen as an advisor to support the extension of its area of concern into the teaching of climate change. =Keystone Pipeline= In a CBC interview aired in April 2013, as Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver lobbied in Washington, DC for approval of Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands to the Gulf of Mexico, Hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other energy organizations \\"there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil\\" than in conventional oil. Hansen argued that coal, tar sands, and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the Keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands. He explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future: \\"It's not the case where you emit something and you see the effect. We see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear ‚Ä¶ Effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system. It takes decades, even centuries to get the full response. But we know the last time the world was 2 degrees warmer, sea level was 6 meters or 20 feet higher.\\" Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension. =Proposed solutions= Recently Hansen stated his support for a revenue-neutral fee and dividend system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the United States. In an interview on CBC television on March 3, 2015, Dr Hansen stated \\"The solution [to climate change] has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly. They make no sense at all if you look at it from an economic-wide perspective. If we would simply put a fee on carbon ‚Äì you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source (the domestic mines or the ports of entry) and then distribute that money to the public, an equal amount to all legal residents, that would begin to make the prices honest. And that's what the economy needs in order to be most efficient. Right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public. If your child gets asthma, you pay the bill, the fossil fuel company doesn't. What we need is to make the system honest.\\" http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/TV+Shows/Power+%26+Politics+with+Evan+Solomon/ID/2656936485/ At the end of 2008, James Hansen stated five priorities that he felt then President-elect Barack Obama should adopt \\"for solving the climate and energy problems, while stimulating the economy\\": efficient energy use, renewable energy, a smart grid, generation IV nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage. Regarding nuclear, he expressed opposition to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, stating that the $25 Billion (US) surplus held in the Nuclear Waste Fund \\"should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste, and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new long-lived nuclear waste.\\" In 2009, Hansen wrote an open letter to President Obama where he advocated a \\"Moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO2\\". In his first book Storms of My Grandchildren, similarly, Hansen discusses his Declaration of Stewardship, the first principle of which requires \\"a moratorium on coal-fired power plants that do not capture and sequester carbon dioxide\\". In March 2013, Hansen co-authored a paper in Environmental Science & Technology, entitled \\"Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power\\". The paper examined mortality rates per unit of electrical power produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as nuclear power. It estimated that 1.8 million air pollution-caused deaths were prevented worldwide between 1971 and 2009, through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels. The paper also concluded that the emission of some 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between 1971 and 2009. Looking to the future, between 2010 and 2050, it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to 420,000 to 7 million premature deaths and 80 to 240 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper elicited a critical response to Kharecha and Hansen's analysis, from an international group of senior academic energy policy analysts, including Benjamin Sovacool, M.V. Ramana, Mark Z. Jacobson, and Mark Diesendorf. They asserted that nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable, and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants. Sovacool et al. also claim that Kharecha and Hansen's estimates of Chernobyl Disaster mortalities is very low, which biases their conclusions. All of these factors are said to make Kharecha and Hansen's article \\"incomplete and misleading\\". Kharecha and Hansen countered that all the data these scientists use to make their criticism, \\"lacks credibility\\". In 2013, Hansen and three other leading climate experts wrote an open letter to policy makers, saying that \\"continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.\\" The letter was signed by Hansen, Ken Caldeira, Kerry Emanuel, and Tom Wigley. The reaction from anti-nuclear environmental groups (e.g. the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace) was negative, citing nuclear safety and security issues, and the economics of nuclear power plants. Honors and awards Hansen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 for his \\"development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres; development of simplified and three-dimensional global climate models; explication of climate forcing mechanisms; analysis of current climate trends from observational data; and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system.\\" In 2001, he received the 7th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment (endowed with US$250,000) for his research on global warming, and was listed as one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2006. Also in 2006, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) selected James Hansen to receive its Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility \\"for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists' responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance.\\" In 2007, Hansen shared the US$1-million Dan David Prize for \\"achievements having an outstanding scientific, technological, cultural or social impact on our world\\". In 2008, he received the PNC Bank Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for his \\"outstanding achievements\\" in science. At the end of 2008, Hansen was named by EarthSky Communications and a panel of 600 scientist- advisors as the Scientist Communicator of the Year, citing him as an \\"outspoken authority on climate change\\" who had \\"best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during 2008.\\" In 2009, Hansen was awarded the 2009 Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the American Meteorological Society, for his \\"outstanding contributions to climate modeling, understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity, and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena.\\" Hansen won the 2010 Sophie Prize, set up in 1997 by Norwegian Jostein Gaarder, the author of the 1991 best-selling novel and teenagers' guide to philosophy Sophie's World, for his \\" key role for the development of our understanding of human-induced climate change.\\" Foreign Policy named Hansen one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers \\"for sounding the alarm on climate change, early and often\\". In December 2012, Hansen received the Commonwealth Club of California's annual Stephen H. Schneider Award for Outstanding Climate Science Communications at a ceremony in San Francisco On November 7, 2013 Hansen received the Joseph Priestley Award at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania \\"...for his work advancing our understanding of climate change, including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans' impact on climate, and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy.\\" He delivered a lecture, entitled, \\"White House Arrest and the Climate Crisis,\\" later that same day at Anita Tuvin Schlechter Auditorium on the college's campus. James Hansen was co- winner with climatologist Syukuro Manabe of the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Climate Change category in the ninth edition (2016) of the awards. The two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior. Decades ago, they correctly predicted how much Earth's temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric CO2. The scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by Manabe and Hansen. In June 2018, Hansen was named joint winner, with Veerabhadran Ramanathan, of Taiwan's Tang Prize. Hansen's prize had a total value of NT$25 million. Controversies =Political interference at NASA= In 2006, Hansen alleged that NASA administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change. Hansen said that NASA public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a December 2005 lecture at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. NASA responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception. Two years after Hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees, the agency's inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place, with the NASA Office of Public Affairs having \\"reduced, marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public\\". In June 2006, Hansen appeared on 60 Minutes stating that the George W. Bush White House had edited climate-related press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening. He also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials, and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career. =Trials for energy company executives= In 2008 interviews with ABC News, The Guardian, and in a separate op-ed, Hansen has called for putting fossil fuel company executives, including the CEOs of ExxonMobil and Peabody Coal, on trial for \\"high crimes against humanity and nature\\", on the grounds that these and other fossil-fuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about global warming, in the same way that tobacco companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer. =Arrest for protest demonstration= James Hansen arrested at a demonstration outside the White House, August 29, 2011Hansen and 1,251 other activists were arrested in August and September 2011, at another demonstration in front of the White House. Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude oil from Canada's Athabasca Tar Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension. =Criticism= In January 2009, Andrew Freedman wrote in The Washington Post, that the American Meteorological Society had erred in giving Hansen its Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal: \\"His body of work is not at issue... Rather, the problem arises due to the AMS' recognition of Hansen's public communication work on climate change.\\" Former AMS member Joseph D'Aleo, a skeptic of human-caused climate change, also criticized the award. Also in 2009, physicist Freeman Dyson criticised Hansen's climate-change activism. \\"The person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is Jim Hansen. He consistently exaggerates all the dangers... Hansen has turned his science into ideology.\\" Hansen responded that if Dyson \\"is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet, then he should first do his homework\\". Dyson stated in an interview that the argument with Hansen was exaggerated by The New York Times, stating that he and Hansen are \\"friends, but we don't agree on everything.\\" After Hansen's arrest in 2009 in West Virginia, New York Times columnist Andrew Revkin wrote: \\"Dr. Hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists, particularly government scientists, in the environmental policy debate.\\" In June 2009, New Yorker journalist Elizabeth Kolbert wrote that Hansen is \\"increasingly isolated among climate activists.\\" Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that \\"I view Jim Hansen as heroic as a scientist.... But I wish he would stick to what he really knows. Because I don't think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible, or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem.\\" In July 2009, New York Times climate columnist Christa Marshall asked if Hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate, noting that he \\"has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against President Obama's plan for a cap- and-trade system.\\" \\"The right wing loves what he's doing,\\" said Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. Hansen said that he had to speak out, since few others could explain the links between politics and the climate models. \\"You just have to say what you think is right,\\" he said.

motorsports. He is best known for being the lap-by-lap commentator for Formula 1 and CART series races for ESPN, ABC Sports, and Speed Channel among others. Early years Varsha was born in Northport, New York, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree in foreign language. While attending Dartmouth, Varsha won varsity letters in cross country and track. He made the finals of the U.S. Olympic Trials marathon event twice, doing so while attending Emory University School of Law. Varsha won the inaugural Peach Bowl Half Marathon in 1980 at a time of 1:08:23. Varsha practiced law in Atlanta, but his life took a different direction when TBS asked him to cover the Peachtree Road Race, which he headed as part of the Atlanta Track Club in 1980. He did so well that TBS offered him a part-time job. In 1986, Varsha joined ESPN, where he hosted the network's Formula One coverage as well many other international sports events including gymnastics, figure skating, track & field and 24 Hours of Le Mans. Speed and Fox Broadcasting Varsha hosting Speed's coverage of the US Grand Prix at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2006 In 1999, Varsha moved to Speed, then known as SpeedVision. In 2002 and 2003, Varsha was the host of Speed's Champ Car coverage. Rick DeBruhl took over Varsha's Formula One host chair for that period. In 2004, Varsha returned to his Formula One hosting duties. In 2004, Varsha was also a part-time host/narrator for Speed's coverage of the World Rally Championship, even reporting on-site from the WRC's inaugural event in Mexico. Varsha also commentated on the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction on Speed Channel in Scottsdale, Arizona, Palm Beach, Florida, Orange County, California and Las Vegas, Nevada annually. At the end of the 2012 Formula 1 season, it was announced that Speed and Fox would no longer present the entire live Formula 1 schedule for the United States market. Varsha, who was under contract to Speed, was quoted as saying that this merely represented \\"one single apex in a life of innumerable apices.\\" Varsha was the lead broadcaster for the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship on Fox Sports 1 & Fox Sports 2 through the end of the 2016 season. He is also leader of the network's FIA World Endurance Championship coverage, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Varsha was the original studio host for the Formula E series on Fox Sports. Starting in the 2016-17 season, he joined the world feed as a host and continued this role in the 2017-18 season. Other networks CBS \\"borrowed\\" Varsha and other talent from Speed when they broadcast Champ Car races in 2002 & 2003\\\\. Varsha was permitted by Fox to host three F1 races during the 2013 season for the NBC Sports Network (the three races that are on the same day as an IZOD IndyCar Series race--Malaysia, Belgium, and Korea--as regular lead host Leigh Diffey was also lead host on IndyCar broadcasts for NBCSN), which carried F1 in the United States until the end of 2017. In 2014, Varsha was again permitted to work with NBCSN's coverage, but NBCSN decided instead to have Varsha be lead broadcaster for the Verizon IndyCar Series races instead of Formula 1, where Diffey remained lead broadcaster for the entire season. In 2014, Varsha worked Carb Day, Pocono, and the Toronto IndyCar race weekends. Varsha called the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix on NBCSN with Steve Matchett and David Hobbs filling in for regular F1 announcer Leigh Diffey who was ill. Varsha also covered for Diffey on NBCSN's coverage of the F1 Singapore Grand Prix on September 17, 2017, as Diffey was on assignment covering the IndyCar Series finale the same weekend. Radio In January 2002 Varsha joined Focus On Racing Radio, syndicated by Westwood One. The show originates from Memphis, Tennessee, but Varsha hosts from Atlanta, Georgia and from the Speed TV studios in Charlotte, North Carolina Varsha's co-host on the show is Forrest Goodman of Memphis, Tennessee.F O R R E S T  G O O D M A N The radio program is delivered in a magazine-style format and features interviews with top drivers from all forms of motorsports. The show's slogan is \\"The Fastest Hour In Radio!\\" Varsha was play-by-play radio announcer for the 2014 United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. Personal life Varsha's son, Matt, drove in the Star Mazda Series for most of 2006, but had to withdraw near season's end due to lack of financial backing. In January 2020, Varsha revealed that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and would begin chemotherapy treatment. On April 5, 2020, Varsha announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and had gone into a 14-day quarantine.

Formation and growth  The SNPJ was formed in Chicago, Illinois on April 6, 1904, and held its first convention on April 9.Schmidt p.315 The society was organized the result of a call in a Slovenian language newspaper for a new Slovenian benefit society. The founding twelve delegates represented nine independent Slovene groupsHistory of SNPJ with a total membership of 276. The organization was incorporated on June 17, 1907. The incorporation was delayed over a year because of an Illinois law which required fraternal benefit groups to have at least 500 members.Schmidt p.315 In 1905 membership had grown to over 1,500 in 27 lodges. By only 1907 there were almost 4,300 members in 60 lodges. In 1917 the SNPJ, with 16,700 members in 360 lodges, had become the largest Slovene fraternal benefit society in the United States. In the late 1960s the Society had 68,000 members. In 1979 it had 56,000 members in 350 lodges in twenty states.Schmidt p.316 In 1921, the SNPJ merged with the Slovene Workmen's Benefit Society, or SDPZ, (which had previously absorbed the St. Barbara Lodge and the Slovene Labor Benefit and Pension Union).

Cyprus had been seized by Ptolemy, and was used as a base for operations against the Antigonid territories in Asia Minor and the Levant. In 306 BC, Antigonus sent his son Demetrius to invade the island, which was defended by Ptolemy's brother Menelaus. After landing on the northeastern part of the island, Demetrius marched to Salamis, defeated Menelaus in a battle, and laid siege to the city. This was the first time where Demetrius demonstrated his flair for siege warfare, which would later earn him the sobriquet Poliorcetes, \\"the Besieger\\". Nevertheless, Menelaus was able to hold off Demetrius' attacks until the arrival of reinforcements. Ptolemy led a large-scale rescue expedition in person, hoping to catch Demetrius between his own forces and those of Menelaus, sallying forth from Salamis. Demetrius took a calculated risk by leaving only a small force to impede Menelaus, and focusing the bulk of his forces against Ptolemy. The ensuing battle was a complete victory for Demetrius, who destroyed or captured much of Ptolemy's fleet and army. After the battle, Menelaus and his men surrendered, and the rest of Cyprus was captured by Demetrius. In the wake of this victory, Antigonus assumed the royal title that had been vacant since the murder of Alexander's underage son, followed by the other Diadochi soon after.  Background During the wars of the Diadochi that followed the death of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, who had seized control of Egypt, had taken over the island of Cyprus and used it as a base of operations against his rival Antigonus I Monophthalmus. From Cyprus, Ptolemy's forces were able to raid the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor, territories controlled by Antigonus. In early 306 BC, Antigonus resolved to remove this threat, and ordered his son, Demetrius, to capture the island. Demetrius at the time was in Greece, where he had in the previous year overthrown the garrison installed in Athens by the ruler of Macedon, Cassander. The city, along with neighbouring Megara, was restored to democratic rule, and allied itself with Demetrius. As a result, when Demetrius sailed from Athens in spring 306 to capture Cyprus, he was accompanied by 30 Athenian quadriremes. Crossing the Aegean, Demetrius made for the coast of Caria, whence he called upon the Rhodians to join him, per the terms of their alliance with his father. The Rhodians, however, who maintained good relations with Ptolemy, refused. Going on to Cilicia, where he was reinforced with more troops, Demetrius then crossed over to Cyprus with an army of 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. This was accompanied by a fleet numbering 53 heavy ships‚Äî7 heptereis, 10 hexereis, 20 quinqueremes‚Äîand upwards of 110 lighter vessels‚Äîtriremes and quadriremes‚Äîalthough the exact numbers are somewhat unclear. He was opposed by Ptolemy's brother, Menelaus, who disposed of 12,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 60 ships.  Siege of Salamis and Ptolemy's arrival in Cyprus  Demetrius landed on the Karpasia Peninsula on the northeast of the island and established a fortified encampment, protected by a palisade and a moat. From there he began raiding the area, and captured the towns of Karpasia and Urania. Leaving his fleet there, he then marched on land against the city of Salamis. Menelaus confronted Demetrius in battle some forty stadia (about five miles) from the city, but his army of 12,000 infantry and 800 cavalry were defeated in a brief battle with heavy loss (1,000 dead and 3,000 captured according to Diodorus Siculus) and had to retreat behind its walls. Demetrius freed the captives and enrolled them in his army, but soon they tried to defect, so Demetrius sent them to his father in Syria instead. Following the battle, Menelaus hastily made ready for a siege of Salamis, mounting catapults on the walls, and sent messengers to his brother for aid. Demetrius also began preparations for the first of the sieges that would earn Demetrius his later nickname of \\"Poliorcetes\\" (\\"the Besieger\\"): skilled craftsmen and large quantities of wood and iron were brought from Asia to begin constructing large siege engines, including two large battering rams encased in large canopies to protect them from missiles, and a massive, nine- level mobile siege tower or helepolis, equipped with catapults and ballistae on each level, operated by a crew of over 200 men. Demetrius then brought his fleet and siege train into action and assaulted the city. After a few days, Demetrius' machines opened a breach in the wall and his subsequent assault nearly proved decisive, and was only stopped by nightfall. During the night, Menelaus gathered flammable material and was able to set the largest siege engines on fire. In the meantime, in response to his brother's appeals, Ptolemy himself had sailed from Alexandria at the head of his fleet. He arrived at Paphus, on the western coast of Cyprus, at the head of 140 warships, all quadriremes and quinqueremes, and of over 10,000 men on 200 transports. According to Plutarch, Ptolemy issued an ultimatum to Demetrius to leave Cyprus, while the latter countered with the offer that he would do so, if Ptolemy were to withdraw his garrisons from the cities of Sicyon and Corinth in Greece. Ptolemy decided to try to make a night dash from Citium, round Cape Greko, to Salamis, hoping to surprise Demetrius and combine his fleet with his brother‚Äôs sixty ships so they could then outnumber Demetrius. Demetrius, however, informed of Ptolemy's arrival, took steps in order to prevent this from happening: he equipped his ships with missile-throwers, brought aboard his best troops as marines, and sailed his fleet to anchor just outside the harbour of the city, bottling up Menelaus in the harbour and interposing himself between the two enemy fleets. This meant that Demetrius took a calculated risk that he would be able to defeat Ptolemy before Menelaus could sail out of the harbour and attack him in the rear.  The naval combat before Salamis  Map of ancient Cyprus. As Ptolemy's fleet came into view of the city right after dawn on the day of the battle, they found Demetrius' fleet deployed and waiting for them. His fleet augmented to some 180 vessels with ships captured in Cyprus, Demetrius concentrated the bulk against Ptolemy, leaving only 10 quinqueremes under Antisthenes to blockade the narrow exit of the harbour of Salamis and prevent or at least delay Menelaus' intervention. Demetrius had gathered his best ships‚Äîthe seven Phoenician heptereis, the Athenian squadron, and behind them 10 hexereis and 10 quinqeremes‚Äîon the left, under command of the admiral Medius of Larissa. Medius was apparently the actual overall commander of the fleet, although Demetrius himself was also present on the left wing on his flagship, a hepteres. His centre comprised the lightest vessels in his fleet, under the command of Themison of Samos and Marsyas of Pella, while the right was entrusted to Hegesippus of Halicarnassus and Pleistias of Cos, the chief pilot (archikybernetes, the second-in-command after Medius) of the fleet. Ptolemy quickly matched his fleet to mirror his opponent's dispositions: he ordered the transports carrying his army to fall back, and massed the largest ships of his fleet on his own left, which he commanded in person. As the historian Richard Billows writes, \\"the battle was in effect a race to see which of the two dynasts could first defeat the enemy's right wing and turn to attack the enemy's center\\", with the \\"added question of whether or not Menelaus would succeed in breaking out of Salamis in time to intervene\\". According to Diodorus Siculus, who provides the fullest, and probably most reliable, account of the battle, when the two fleets were about three stadia apart, both Demetrius and Ptolemy raised the signal to attack (a gilded shield), and the two fleets charged each other. Diodorus describes the ramming and boarding actions, as well as the missile exchanges, that dominated the fight: Demetrius himself won distinction for his bravery when Ptolemy's men boarded his flagship, \\"by hurling his javelins at some of them and by striking others at close range with his spear\\", despite being himself subject to \\"many missiles of all sorts\\". Of his three bodyguards, who tried to protect him with their shields, one was killed and the others severely wounded. The Athenians also fought with distinction, as Demetrius awarded 1,200 suits of armour to Athens from the spoils taken. In the end, both left wings proved victorious, but it was Demetrius who won the race: by the time Ptolemy turned to attack Demetrius' centre, he found the rest of his fleet already defeated and in flight. Menelaus' 60 ships meanwhile, under the command of Menoetius, managed to break through Demetrius' blockade, only to find the battle already lost.  Aftermath of the battle  Demetrius tasked Neon and Burichus with pursuing the defeated enemy and picking up the men from the sea, and returned in triumph to his camp. According to Diodorus, his fleet had only lost 20 damaged ships, all of which returned to service after repairs, while Ptolemy's fleet had lost 80 ships. More importantly, Demetrius' forces had captured fully 40 of Ptolemy's warships intact with their crews, as well as over a hundred of the transports with some 8,000 troops aboard. Plutarch goes further, claiming that Ptolemy managed to save only eight of his ships, and that 70 of Ptolemy's ships were captured. Among the numerous prisoners taken by Demetrius was the courtesan Lamia of Athens, who later became the mistress of Demetrius, as well as Leontiscus, one of Ptolemy's sons. Following his defeat, Ptolemy retreated to Egypt, and Menelaus was forced to surrender Salamis and its garrison, further increasing Demetrius' strength. Demetrius then moved to take over the rest of Cyprus, taking over the garrisons into his own army as well. According to Diodorus, the total strength added to his forces thus were 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry. Despite their rivalry, the relationship between Ptolemy and Demetrius was characterized by a mutual respect and chivalrous conduct: after the Ptolemaic victory at Gaza in spring 312 BC Ptolemy had unconditionally released the captives and baggage train of Demetrius', a gesture reciprocated by Demetrius after his success at Myus in the next year. Demetrius honoured this after Salamis as well, immediately releasing Menelaus and other relatives and friends of Ptolemy who had been captured with their personal possessions. When Ptolemy recaptured Cyprus in 295 BC, and found Demetrius' mother and children at Salamis, he again reciprocated by immediately releasing them.  Impact  The victory at Salamis was used by Antigonus as a suitable pretext for his own proclamation as king (basileus), the Macedonian throne having lain vacant since the murder of Alexander IV of Macedon by Cassander in 309 BC. At the same time, Demetrius was raised to co-king alongside his father. Antigonus' assumption of the royal title was followed by an attempt to eliminate Ptolemy for good in a massive, but failed, invasion of Egypt in autumn 306, and then by the celebrated, but equally unsuccessful, Siege of Rhodes by Demetrius in 305‚Äì304 BC. Finally, in 302 BC the remaining dynasts‚ÄîPtolemy, Cassander, Seleucus, and Lysimachus‚Äîhaving in turn assumed the royal title themselves, allied against Antigonus and defeated him in the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus was killed, and his realm was broken up and divided among the victors. Demetrius survived the battle, and thanks to his large fleet managed to maintain control of a coastal and insular realm encompassing Cyprus, the Cyclades, Sidon, Tyre, Corinth, and the major cities of western Asia Minor. During the next years, Cyprus became a base of operations for Demetrius in the Levant, and for his imposition of control over Athens and southern Greece. During his absence in Greece, however, Ptolemy seized Cyprus in 295 BC. The Battle of Salamis is proposed by modern scholars as one of three possible naval battles‚Äîalong with the Battle of Amorgos (322 BC) and the Battle of Cos (261/255 BC)‚Äîthat provided the occasion for the erection of the statue of the Nike of Samothrace.

The language serves as the foundation for kdb+, an in-memory, column-based database, and other related financial products. The language, originally developed in 1993, is a variant of APL and contains elements of Scheme. Advocates of the language emphasize its speed, facility in handling arrays, and expressive syntax.  History  Before developing K, Arthur Whitney had worked extensively with APL, first at I. P. Sharp Associates alongside Ken Iverson and Roger Hui, and later at Morgan Stanley developing financial applications. At Morgan Stanley, Whitney helped to develop A+, a variant of APL, to facilitate migrating APL applications from IBM mainframe computers to a network of Sun workstations. A+ had a smaller set of primitive functions and was designed for speed and to handle large sets of time series data. In 1993, Whitney left Morgan Stanley and developed the first version of the K language. At the same time he formed Kx Systems to commercialize the product and signed an exclusive contract with Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS). For the next four years he developed various financial and trading applications using K for UBS. The contract ended in 1997 when UBS merged with Swiss Bank. In 1998, Kx Systems released kdb+, a database built on K. kdb was an in-memory, column-oriented database and included ksql, a query language with an SQL-like syntax. Since then, several financial products have been developed with K and kdb+. kdb+/tick and kdb+/taq were developed in 2001. kdb+, a 64-bit version of kdb+ was released in 2003 and kdb+/tick and kdb+/taq were released in 2004. kdb+ included Q, a language that merged the functions of the underlying K language and ksql. Whitney released a derivative of K called Shakti in 2018.https://shakti.com/history/  Overview  K shares key features with APL. They are both interpreted, interactive languages noted for concise and expressive syntax. They have simple rules of precedence based on right to left evaluation. The languages contain a rich set of primitive functions designed for processing arrays. These primitive functions include mathematical operations that work on arrays as whole data objects, and array operations, such as sorting or reversing the order of an array. In addition, the language contains special operators that combine with primitive functions to perform types of iteration and recursion. As a result, complex and extended transformations of a dataset can be expressed as a chain of sub-expressions, with each link performing a segment of the calculation and passing the results to the next link in the chain. Like APL, the primitive functions and operators are represented by single or double characters; however, unlike APL, K restricts itself to the ASCII character set (as does another APL variant, J). To allow for this, the set of primitive functions for K is smaller and heavily overloaded, with each of the ASCII symbols representing two or more distinct functions or operations. In a given expression, the actual function referenced is determined by the context. As a result, K expressions can be opaque and difficult to parse for humans. For example, in the following contrived expression the exclamation point \`!\` refers to three distinct functions: 2!!7!4 Reading from right to left the first \`!\` is modulo division that is performed on 7 and 4 resulting in 3. The next \`!\` is enumeration and lists the integers less than 3, resulting in the list 0 1 2. The final \`!\` is rotation where the list on the right is rotated two times to the left producing the final result of 2 0 1. The second core distinction of K is that functions are first-class objects, a concept borrowed from Scheme. First-class functions can be used in the same contexts where a data value can be used. Functions can be specified as anonymous expressions and used directly with other expressions. Function expressions are specified in K using curly brackets. For example, in the following expression a quadratic expression is defined as a function and applied to the values 0 1 2 and 3: {(3*x^2)+(2*x)+1}'!4 In K, named functions are simply function expressions stored to a variable in the same way any data value is stored to a variable. a:25 f:{(x^2)-1} Functions can be passed as an argument to another function or returned as a result from a function.  Examples  K is an interpreted language where every statement is evaluated and its results displayed immediately. Literal expressions such as strings evaluate to themselves. Consequently, the Hello world-program is trivial: \\"Hello world!\\" The following expression sorts a list of strings by their lengths: x@>#:'x The expression is evaluated from right to left as follows: # #:'x returns the length of each word in the list x. # > returns the indices that would sort a list of values in descending order. # @ use the integer values on the right to index into the original list of strings. A function to determine if a number is prime can be written as: {&/x!/:2_!x} The function is evaluated from right to left: # !x enumerate the positive integers less than x. # 2_ drops the first two elements of the enumeration (0 and 1). # x!/: performs modulo division between the original integer and each value in the truncated list. # &/ find the minimum value of the list of modulo result. If x is not prime then one of the values returned by the modulo operation will be 0 and consequently the minimal value of the list. If x is prime then the minimal value will be 1, because x mod 2 is 1 for any prime greater than 2. The function below can be used to list all of the prime numbers between 1 and R with: 2_&{&/x!/:2_!x}'!R The expression is evaluated from right to left # !R enumerate the integers less than R. # ' apply each value of the enumeration to the prime number function on the left. This will return a list of 0's and 1's. # & return the indices of the list where the value is 1. # 2_ drop the first two elements of the enumeration (0 and 1) K financial products K is the foundation for a family of financial products. Kdb+ is an in-memory, column- based database with much of the same functions of a relational database management system. The database supports SQL, SQL-92 and ksql, a query language with a syntax similar to SQL and designed for column based queries and array analysis.

Biremes were long vessels built for military purposes and could achieve relatively high speed. They were invented well before the 6th century BC and were used by the Phoenicians, Assyrians & Greeks.

NIS, Rome, pp 35-84. exhibited in the Pius-Clementine Museum in the Vatican Museums. The name bireme comes from \\"bi-\\" meaning two and \\"-reme\\" meaning oar. It was typically about long with a maximum beam width of around . It was modified from the penteconter, a ship that had only one set of oars on each side, the bireme having two sets of oars on each side. The bireme was twice the triaconter's length and height, and thus employed 120 rowers. Biremes were galleys, galleasses, dromons, and small pleasure crafts pamphyles. The next development, the trireme, keeping the length of the bireme, added a tier to the height, the rowers being thus increased to 180. It also had a large square sail. Uses These ships were frequently used by the Romans, as during the second of Caesar's invasions of Britain. The bireme eventually evolved into the trireme. A unit commandant (who was given a tent on the open deck) directed a group of marines. The bireme was also recorded in ancient history on the 8th and early 7th-century Assyrian reliefs, where they were used to carry out an amphibious attack on the coast of Elam and the lagoons of the Persian Gulf during the reign of Sennacherib. Medieval galleys are also described as \\"bireme\\" or \\"trireme\\" depending on the number of their banks of oars. The terminology can lead to confusion, since the terms are also used for rowed warships of the Greco-Roman period built on entirely different design principles. Dimensions and development In 1275, Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily, issued an order for the construction of several galleys that provide the earliest evidence for the dimensions of the bireme galleys. Because of increased weight and breadth, which brought increased friction through the water, a trireme galley was not dramatically faster than a bireme. But the change to trireme produced more significant developments than a gain in tactical speed over short distances. Early bireme galleys escorted merchant ships but were rarely used to carry goods. A few Genoese freight contracts of the mid-13th century record charters for bireme galleys.

Design The mascots were named after the Greek gods Athena and Apollo, Phevos being a transcription of the modern Greek pronunciation of Phoebus, an epithet of Apollo. They were loosely modeled after an archaic Greek terra cotta daidala from the 7th century BC, which was recommended by curators at the National Archaeological Museum. Controversy The mascots were based on this archaic terracotta daidala at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Prior to the Games, a group affiliated with the Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum called the Greek Society of the Friends of the Ancients and a Hellenic polytheistic group called the Committee for the Greek Religion Dodecatheon, devoted to the preservation of ancient Greek culture, sued over the mascots, claiming that they \\"savagely insult\\" Classical Greek culture. In a BBC Radio interview on June 26, 2004, Dr. Pan. Marinis President of the Societas Hellenica Antiquariorum said that the mascots: \\"mock the spiritual values of the Hellenic Civilization by degrading these same holy personalities that were revered during the ancient Olympic Games. For these reasons we have proceeded to legal action demanding the punishment of those responsible.\\" The fact that the organizing committee referred to the daidala as dolls has been the cause of some controversy among scholars of Ancient Greek culture, as the daidala were religious artifacts.

The capital Prague is about 60 km towards south. History The region of Lovosice was inhabited already in the Bronze Age. Some evidence indicates that the first Czechs lived right here. The first mention of Lovosice is from April 12, 1143. Duke Vladislaus II gave this small village to the Strahov monastery. Emperor Rudolf II promoted the village to the status of town on July 4, 1600. Lovosice was 1756 the site of a major battle between Prussia and the Austrian empire, at the Battle of Lobositz. During World War II, due to the Munich Agreement, Lovosice fell within a German occupation zone, commonly called Sudetenland. Only 600 Czechs stayed in the town at that time.

Creation of the islands started in 2001. Palm Jumeirah The Palm Jumeirah seen from the International Space Station. Palm Jumeirah is the site of private residences and hotels. From the air, the archipelago resembles a stylized palm tree within a circle. Palm Jumeirah was built in the early 21st century and was largely financed from Dubai's income from petroleum. Environmental concerns The construction of the Dubai Palm Islands has had a significant impact on the surrounding environment, resulting in changes to area wildlife, coastal erosion, alongshore sediment transport and wave patterns. Sediment stirred up by construction has suffocated and injured local marine fauna and reduced the amount of sunlight which filters down to seashore vegetation. Variations in alongshore sediment transport have resulted in changes in erosion patterns along the UAE coast, which has also been exacerbated by altered wave patterns as the waters of the Persian Gulf attempt to move around the new obstruction of the islands. Dubai's megaprojects have become a favorite cause of environmentalists. Greenpeace has criticized the Palm Islands for lack of sustainability, and Mongabay.com, a site dedicated to rain forest conservation, has attacked Dubai's artificial islands aggressively, stating that: > Significant changes in the maritime environment [of Dubai] are leaving a > visual scar [... ] As a result of the dredging and redepositing of sand for > the construction of the islands, the typically crystalline waters of the > Persian Gulf at Dubai have become severely clouded with silt. Construction > activity is damaging the marine habitat, burying coral reefs, oyster beds > and subterranean fields of sea grass, threatening local marine species as > well as other species dependent on them for food. Oyster beds have been > covered in as much as two inches of sediment, while above the water, beaches > are eroding with the disruption of natural currents. Structural importance Palm Jumeirah was built entirely from sand and rocks (no concrete or steel was used to build the island). This was done in accordance with the order of the Ruler of Dubai, who came up with the idea for the Palm Islands, as well as their design. Construction resources involved *5.5 million cubic meters of rock brought from over 16 quarries in Dubai. *94 million cubic meters of sand brought from deep sea beds 6 nautical miles from the coast of Dubai. *700 tons of limestone Project risks and threats *Sinking *Waves 2 meters high. *Annual or biennial storm frequency. *Weak soil due to constant exposure to rising sea water. *Water pollution. Hidden problems *Erosion (caused by winds and water currents) is one of the biggest problems present, as it strips away the sand which forms the majority of the island. *Damage to the marine ecology (e.g. the loss of reefs and fish), including disturbances in the reproductive cycles of the species of fish that were close to the shores of Dubai. Research conducted by marine biologists on this phenomenon showed that the newly born fish were not able to survive in conditions along the shores of Dubai due to constant construction and environmental alterations (e.g. shifting of sand, moving boulders and the effects of the vibrations). *Due to the shape of the island right outside the coast of Dubai, there is loss of coastal shape along the seashore of Dubai. Obstacles after the island construction Installation of utilities and pipelines was very difficult and laborious. Risk mitigation To counteract with the waves and the constant motion of the sea, breakwaters were built all around the island. They were 3 meters high and 160 kilometers in total length. Expanded over a length of about 11.5 kilometers, the base of these breakwaters and the island itself were constantly monitored during construction process with the help of deep sea divers. The divers checked the alignment and placement of the rocks beneath the surface to ensure its stability. Shape of the island was monitored using the global positioning system. The sand on top of the island was sprayed by a technique called rainbowing. Here the sand from the dredging ships was sprayed on to the land. The whole island was planned such that there was no stagnant water between the island and the breakwaters. In order to achieve this, small structural modifications were made to the breakwaters that surrounded the island, allowing the sea water to move through the breakers without causing any damage to the island. To prevent erosion of the sand from the island, maintenance systems spray material along the coast of the island and also along the Dubai coast. Coastal ecology was recovered with the help of nature itself. These changes began attracting newer species of fishes and also reef formations. Every 6 weeks sea divers go down under water to check the marine life as part of their monitoring process. Precautions were also taken to prevent the process of liquifaction of the sand on the island (below the upper surface). This process of liquifaction was caused by the movement of the rocks and sand and also underwater erosion before and after construction. A Vibro-compaction technique was used to prevent the process of liquifaction. This was carried out in order to hold the island's base together and also to make a strong foundation for further construction. Construction effects and repercussions The construction of the Palm islands along the coast of Dubai has caused several large environmental changes: a reduction in the area's aquatic life, erosion of the coastal soil, and irregular sediment transport along the shore. There is also a dramatic change in wave patterns along the coast of Dubai due to the rock walls constructed around the palm islands: instead of hitting the shores directly, the waves move in an unusual manner around the new obstruction. This has led to the weakening of the shores of Dubai. The origin of most of the environmental damage stems from disturbed sediment from construction of the Palm islands. The sediment decreased the amount of sunlight filtering down to the sea vegetation and injured the surrounding marine fauna. Environmental disturbances caused by changes in sediment and coastal erosion have attracted the attention of environmental groups such as Greenpeace. The World Wildlife Fund announced in 2006, \\"[The] UAE's human pressure on global ecosystems (its ecological footprint) [is] the highest in the world. The country is supposedly at present five times more unsustainable than any other country\\" (Samarai 2007). It also mentioned that the construction from the start up to date had caused many visible ecological and environmental changes that were a threat to the future. =Remedial measure to protect the coast= To properly manage their shorelines and effects, Dubai relies on its coastal monitoring program. Established in 1997, the Dubai coastal monitoring program began studying the baseline bathymetric (measurement of depth of water in oceans or seas) and topographic survey of the Jumeirah (Dubai) coastline. Additional data were collected with technological improvements including remote video monitoring of Dubai beaches, sediment sampling and analysis, near shore directional wave and current recordings and intensive measurement exercises at selected locations using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) equipment. This way they were able to do a constant monitor and check on the continuously changing environmental conditions along the coast of Dubai.

Two Norfolk Southern freight trains meet on the Rockville Bridge The Rockville Bridge, at the time of its completion in 1902, was, and remains, the longest stone masonry arch railroad viaduct in the world. Constructed between April 1900 and March 1902 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, it has forty-eight 70-foot spans, for a total length of . The bridge crosses the Susquehanna River about north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The eastern end is in Rockville, and the western end is just south of Marysville. History The original bridge on the spot opened on September 1, 1849, when the PRR began operating over it. The Northern Central Railway began to use it after abandoning their Marysville Bridge. The current bridge was built by Italian laborers, who worked for two contractors (Drake & Stratton Co. and H.S. Kerbaugh), one on the east side of the Susquehanna River and one on the west. Local people from the Harrisburg area also worked on the bridge. For most of its life the bridge carried four main line tracks. They were reduced to three in the 1980s when the PRR Main Line was modernized across Pennsylvania. In the late 1990s an intermodal container was blown off an intermodal freight train and landed in the river, prompting Norfolk Southern to reconfigure the track layout by terminating the wye track to Enola at the west end of the bridge. This reduced the number of main line tracks to two, but left a buffer zone on either side to prevent further containers ending up in the river, although high winds from the departing December 2010 North American blizzard resulted in a similar outcome on December 27, 2010.WHTM-TV article on containers blown off bridge Retrieved 2010-12-27 The track from the west side of the bridge was shortened back to a new CP point named \\"Mary\\" not because of wind blowing containers off, but because the curve in the switch at the former location caused lateral forces to blow out the side of the spandrel. This led to the failure of the downriver side under the weight of a coal train. When the spandrel failed, it also disproved the once popular thought that the core of the bridge was filled with concrete. During times of high wind it is routine to park heavy trains on the bridge as a wind shield. Currently, the bridge is used by the Norfolk Southern Railway and Amtrak. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

It was originally produced from 1963 until 1988, and was revived in 2002. The show's second incarnation aired until 2011 on Animal Planet in the United States. A third incarnation streamed webisodes on a dedicated Youtube channel from 2013 to 2018. Original show The original Wild Kingdom grew from discussions that started in 1962 between zoologist Marlin Perkins and V. J. Skutt, the chairman and CEO of insurance company Mutual of Omaha. The company had been the sponsor of an earlier animal-related show, Zoo Parade, that Perkins had hosted from 1952 until 1957. Also intimately involved with the creation of Wild Kingdom was Zoo Parade producer Don Meier, who was credited as the program's creator.Animal Planet :: Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom Mutual of Omaha sponsored and lent its name to the new program. Wild Kingdom won Emmy Awards for \\"outstanding program achievement\\" in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969. Liz and Henk Maartens, from Irene, Pretoria, South Africa, won five Emmy Awards for the documentary program Wild Kingdom in 1970. One Emmy Award was for camerawork while the other Emmy Awards were for aspects of production.screenafrica.com Wild Kingdom was first broadcast by NBC. The half- hour show aired on Sundays starting January 6, 1963, and continued until 1971, when the program entered first-run syndication. As a prime-time syndicated program, Wild Kingdom enjoyed great popularity. Although most of the programs aired after 1971 were repeats, new shows continued to be produced until 1987. Several episodes were filmed by cameraman Roy Pinney. Perkins was the host for most of the show's history until he was forced to retire in 1985 for health reasons, and Jim Fowler, Perkins' long-time assistant and sidekick, became the host. Perkins died of cancer one year later at age 81. One of Wild Kingdoms film editors, Bernard Braham, was offered membership with the American Cinema Editors in 1979 and won an EDDIE award in Hollywood for best documentary of the year, for the episode \\"Desert Spring\\". His competition for the award was a National Geographic episode titled \\"Gold\\". He was also nominated for several other awards. Perkins often introduced commercial spots by tying them into the subject of the show. For example, at the end of a segment about lions, he might say something like, \\"Just as the mother lion protects her cubs, you can protect your children with an insurance policy from Mutual of Omaha...\\" The format of the show often featured Perkins narrating off-camera, describing Fowler's on-camera work with the wild animals. This was commonly parodied as Perkins saying \\"I'll wait here [someplace safe] while Jim [does something or other with the dangerous animal]\\". However, according to a 1997 interview with Fowler, Perkins never said any such thing: according to Fowler, \\"Johnny Carson started the jokes about me and Marlin in his monologues\\". Perkins often featured pet chimpanzees in the studio: one named \\"W. K.\\" (Wild Kingdom); the other named \\"Mr. Moke\\", after the Mini Moke vehicle. Wild Kingdom increased ecological and environmental awareness in the United States. Its exciting footage brought the wilds of Africa, the Amazon River, and other exotic locales into the living rooms of millions of Americans. It created an interest in commercial nature programming that led to several other wildlife documentary programs going on the air, including Animal World, Wild, Wild World of Animals and Lorne Greene's New Wilderness, and in subsequent decades, to entire cable television networks devoted to these topics, such as the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Many fans of wildlife documentaries still consider Wild Kingdom the \\"gold standard\\" against which other such shows are compared. Mutual of Omaha owns the rights to the program, but several episodes have been released on DVD from BCI Eclipse under license from Mutual of Omaha. Some episodes are also available on an official YouTube channel.Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom WildKingdomTV's YouTube Channel Controversy The show came under heavy criticism in the 1982 investigative piece \\"Cruel Camera\\" by The Fifth Estate, a news magazine program on Canada's CBC Television network, for staging scenes of animal cruelty. Several interviewees who had worked on Wild Kingdom confirmed the rumors that many of the sequences were staged, such as in the episode where Perkins and crew captured a bear in the Florida swamps. In fact, the bear had actually been \\"placed\\" there by the production. Perkins denied such allegations on camera, and when interviewer Bob McKeown pressed him, said, I'd like you to stop your camera right now, please. Revival In 2002, a completely new Wild Kingdom, also sponsored by Mutual of Omaha, began airing new Wild Kingdom specials on Animal Planet. The specials proved to be so popular that, in 2005, the network began airing new weekly episodes during the original Sunday night timeslot.

It empties into the Tennessee River downstream from Chattanooga near the Tennessee-Alabama state line. Hydrography The Sequatchie River originates from several springs at or near Devilstep Hollow Cave, including the spring, Head of the Sequatchie. Dye traces establish the origin of their water as originating from Grassy Cove, the pastoral limestone sinkhole located to the north-east. The Sequatchie River follows the general trend of the Sequatchie Valley, flowing south-west for . Sequatchie River in Pikeville, Tennessee The stream crosses into Bledsoe County near the head of the Sequatchie Valley. The Sequatchie Valley is traversed throughout much its length by U.S. Route 127. The first sizeable town on the Sequatchie is Pikeville, the county seat of Bledsoe. State Route 30, which descends Walden's Ridge into the Valley and then climbs the escarpment back onto the plateau, crosses here. Crossing into Sequatchie County, the stream flows into Dunlap. Just north of Dunlap, US 127 turns southeastward, beginning the ascent onto Walden Ridge and eventually down into Chattanooga. A set of railroad tracks previously ran along the river from this point, testament to heavy underground coal extraction in years past. For almost the rest of its length the Sequatchie is paralleled by State Route 28. State Route 283 also runs along the base of the Walden's Ridge escarpment for several miles. The river then enters Marion County. The town of Whitwell is just a few miles into Marion County. Below Whitwell at the small community of Sequatchie (also known as Sequachee), the river receives the flow of the Little Sequatchie River, which descends from atop the Cumberland Plateau to the west. At Jasper, which is slightly west of the river, is a railroad junction. East of town is the crossing of U.S. Highway 41 by SR 28, and the bridge over the river.

Popular gashapon manufacturers include Tomy, which uses the shortened term for their capsule machines, and Kaiyodo. In the United States, \\"Gashapon\\" is a registered trademark of the Bandai Company, and gashapon are referred to as blind box sets due to packaging requirements by retailers prior to official distribution of the actual gashapon machines. The gashapon model has been adapted digitally into numerous gacha video games such as mobile phone games and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).  Description  Gashapon machines are similar to the coin-operated toy vending machines seen outside grocery stores and other retailers in other countries. While American coin- operated vending toys are usually cheap, low-quality products sold for a few quarters ( or less), Japanese gashapon can cost anywhere from () and are normally a much higher-quality product. They are often constructed from high- grade PVC plastic, and contain more molding detail and intricately painted features. Many gashapon are considered collector's items, with rare ones fetching extremely high prices in secondhand markets. Gashapon toys are often licensed from popular characters in Japanese manga, video games or anime, or from the American entertainment industry. These highly detailed toys have found a large following among all generations in Japan, and the trend is filtering to the world, especially among adult collectors. It is not uncommon for sets marketed specifically for adults to feature risqu√© female figurines. Row of gashapon machines in Japan Gashapon machines in Hong Kong Virtually all gashapon are released in sets‚Äîeach series will have a number of figures to collect. They are, by nature, a \\"blind purchase\\"; people insert coins and hope to get the toy or figure they desire. Such an amusement element may become frustrating, as one risks obtaining the same item repeatedly. Enthusiastic collectors will buy sets from gashapon stores in places such as Tokyo's Akihabara or Osaka's Nipponbashi (Den-Den Town). Depending on the store, the sets are usually cheaper than buying them randomly out of a machine.  Types  = Blind-boxes = In recent years, the term gashapon has also come to refer to blind-box trading figures, which are essentially the same product sold randomly out of sealed packages instead of a machine. = Bottle cap figures = Another variety of gashapon is bottle cap figures. These small figures are mounted atop a plastic bottle cap, as might be found on a twenty- ounce soda bottle. They are sold both in machine capsules and blind boxes. The caps are not functional as they lack screw threads to secure them to the mouth of the bottle.  Video games  = Mini games = Gashapon machines and their random payouts have inspired trinket-collection mini-games in many video games, most notably the Legend of Zelda series' similarly named \\"Gasha Trees\\" in Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons, and, to a much higher extent, the random figurine payout in The Minish Cap. Gashapon have also appeared in some Mario games such as Mario Party 5 and well as Super Smash Bros. Melee where the player inserts a desired amount of coins and gets a trophy of a Nintendo- related nature in return. In both The Minish Cap and Super Smash Bros. Melee, the more the player spends in one go, the higher the chance of getting a new item in return. The bonus stage in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is also gashapon- inspired. Yoshi's Crafted World also uses a gashapon machine for receiving costumes. = Gacha-expanded games = The gashapon concept is taken to the next level in SD Gundam Gashapon Wars, a game based on the SD Gundam television series, in which a gamer can activate extra characters from the game by buying certain series of SD Gundam gashapon toys in real life, namely SD Full Color STAGE:61, then use the password bundled with the toy to unlock the corresponding character in the video game. This is the same marketing tactic used by Kinder Surprise for the online surprises, except there is no online access involved = Gacha mechanic (Gacha games)= Many free-to-play MMOs and mobile games have mechanics inspired by gashapon, with randomly generated items of varying market values being acquired via microtransactions. * In the NES game Mega Man 4 there is an enemy named Gachappon which is a gashapon vending machine modified to shoot energy shots and other kinds of projectiles. The Chip Trader from the Mega Man Battle Network series also functions similarly to gashapon machines. In addition, in Mega Man X: Command Mission, gashapon machines can be found in various places, and contain figures of various Mega Man characters. * In the online massively multiplayer online game PangYa the gashapon is a small Adobe Flash-powered mini-game in which users buy coins using real money, and in turn will give out items ranging from common, low-value items to rare, high-value items. There is also a consistent theme of gashapon items being released in sets, much like their real-life counterparts. * The machines also appear in the Dreamcast game Shenmue, in which the main character Ryo Hazuki could spend yen to collect various figurines, including series of characters from the Virtua Fighter and Sonic the Hedgehog series of games as well as those of other known and lesser known Sega franchises (e.g. Fantasy Zone, Space Harrier, Hang-On). * The GameCube game Gotcha Force is completely based on gashapon toys, pitting a massive variety of capsule toy-sized/themed aliens (called Borgs) against each other and the Galactic Emperor. As the player progresses, they earn new fighters that open from capsules, some of which require multiple parts to complete. Tying into the capsule toy theme even more are the variants that come in a range of styles from an alternate coloring to completely transparent to solid silver, gold, and black versions. * They are also seen in killer7, in which all of the figures are required to open a specific door. * During the course of Resident Evil 4, the player can take part in a shooting range mini-game to unlock models of characters and enemies that are viewable in the Keys/Treasure inventory. There is one figure in each set that requires a higher score to unlock, which could be considered the 'rare' figures. This is also done in Resident Evil 5, which models of characters and enemies are unlocked for viewing by obtaining Completion Points. * In Kingdom Hearts II, there is a rare type of Heartless called the \\"Bulky Vendor,\\" based on a gashapon machine. Only appearing in certain areas of some worlds, its HP bar drops quickly and it jumps and moves faster as time goes on. The player is required to catch up with it and use a Reaction command, from 'Capsule Prize' up to 'Prime Capsule' to receive a capsule which explodes into orbs and an item prize. This is the only way (besides treasure chests) to gain the valuable Orichalcum item. * The PSP game Work Time Fun consists of nothing but playing small mini-games for money to spend in gashapon machines. The machines deposit trinkets whose descriptions often poke fun at common gashapon trinkets. * In the 1998 Yu-Gi- Oh! Toei Animation-produced anime series and the original manga, there are a series of episodes where players play a game called Capsule Monsters (Capmon for short) that involves the use of a gashapon machine to obtain the game pieces in which players used. Mokuba is seen playing this game the most, and is usually Yugi's enemy when it comes to playing this game. In a series later on that was released after the final episodes, there was a special movie that used these Capsule Monsters as a main part of the game. However, unlike the other Capsule Monsters, these ones were made out of bronze or gold, and were shot out from a capsule shooter to battle. * In Pok√©mon XD: Gale of Darkness, there are gashapon machines in the stores such as the Pok√©Mart in Pyrite Town that appear to have Pok√© Balls inside. Pok√© Balls are inspired by the capsules for gashapon machines. * Gashapon is also used in the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja series, the player earns yen by completing tasks, allowing them to put money in the machine; the more money the player puts in, the more likely they will get a gashapon. This system is used for getting miniature figurines, soundtracks, and collectible cards in-game. * In Tales of Vesperia, on both the isle of Nam Cobanda and at the Yumanju hot springs there are gachapon machines which on rare occasion give out figurines for a sidequest. * The Crank-a-Kai machine in Level 5's Yo-kai Watch series is a capsule machine, from which the main character indirectly receives the titular device. By inserting coins, the player can obtain capsules containing items or Yokai. In homage to this, Yo-kai Watch merchandise can be found in gashapon machines in Japan. There is also a Yo-kai who presides over the world's gashapon machines, including the Crank-a-Kai. It fights using capsules obtained within its own personal gashapon machine. Gashapon-style item distribution has been adopted by many massively multiplayer online games, particularly those using the free- to-play model as a form of premium transaction made with real money, often granting access to items exclusive to that system. Examples are: * In the MMO MapleStory, the gashapon is used as a gambling type machine, wherein players can purchase with real money tickets which, when used at the gashapon, will allow the player to receive a random item of random value. * Similarly, in Mabinogi, the premium shop sells gashapon items that hold a variety of in-game items the player can use, such as dyes or armor as well as exclusively colored items and exclusive armor and clothing. * The MMO Cosmic Break uses a gashapon machine called \\"Garapon\\". It has 5 rarities signified by the color of the capsule. Gold is the highest rarity in the game. However, the Garapon is highly controversial due to the pricing and extremely low chance of obtaining these items. It usually costs $3‚Äì5 per spin, as such, due to rarity issues, people have had to spend hundreds of dollars to just get one gold capsule. * In Second Life, many stores run by users of the game have created their own gashapon-style devices called \\"Gacha\\" that sell random objects in their shops. * In Digimon Masters Online, an MMO created by Digitalic and now owned by Move Games, it uses Gachapon Coins on a vending machine that has a chance to give one of four colored capsules.  Gacha games  Games‚Äîoften freemium‚Äîlargely based on a gacha mechanism of monetization are referred to as gacha games. The gacha game model arose in the early 2010s, faring particularly well in Japan. Players may be given free or discounted gacha, but have to pay to get more. The games may feature different tiers of gacha pulls, which give different sets of rewards. Examples of gacha games are Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius, Fire Emblem Heroes, Puzzle & Dragons, and Dragon Collection. The mechanism has come under scrutiny for its similarity to gambling, and some countries require drop rates to be made public, or have banned certain practices (e.g., complete gacha).

Born in Dublin, he also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1904, the American League's Detroit Tigers in 1907, and the Pirates, Brooklyn Robins and Cincinnati Reds in 1918. As a catcher, he could remain squatting and still throw out runners attempting to steal second base due to his unique arm strength, which became his trademark, acquired from the healing of burns that shortened his muscles after an industrial accident in which Archer fell into a vat of boiling sap at the age of 19. His family immigrated to Montreal when he was an infant, later moving to Toronto when he was three; he attended Toronto's De La Salle College and St. Michael's College School. He was working at a barrelmaker in Toronto in 1902 when he suffered the burns which led to a three-month hospitalization. In 1903 he began playing baseball in Manitoba, and in 1904 he joined the Boone, Iowa team of the Iowa State League; he married Boone resident Lillian Stark in 1905. In August 1904 he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates, and he went on to play seven games for the team that season. Newspaper photo showing Archer making a catch while playing with the Cubs in 1915. He later played for Detroit for 18 games during the 1907 season, and started the fifth and final game of the 1907 World Series against the Cubs, but was hitless in three at bats as the Tigers lost 2‚Äì0; both Cub runs followed successful stolen bases against Archer and pitcher George Mullin. In 1909 he began playing for the Cubs, the team he remained with until 1917; he took over catching duties for Johnny Kling, one of the top players on the Cubs pennant winners of 1906 to 1908, who was taking a year off from baseball to pursue other interests. Archer split time with Pat Moran during the 1909 season, and with Kling upon his return for the 1910 season. He played three games en route to the Cubs' 1910 World Series loss to the Philadelphia Athletics, and after doubling with one out, scored the winning run on Jimmy Sheckard's hit with two out in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 4 ‚Äì the 4‚Äì3 victory giving the Cubs their only win in the Series. However, he had only one other hit in the Series, that coming with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 5 when the Cubs were trailing 7‚Äì2. In 1911 Archer won the starting job, and Kling was later that season traded to the Boston Rustlers. Archer ended up finishing 16th in voting for the first Chalmers Award, the first formal MVP award presented in the major leagues. During the 1912 and 1913 seasons, Archer again earned some votes for the Chalmers Award, finishing 22nd in 1912 and 13th in 1913. He led the NL in assists in 1912 with 149, but also paced the league with 23 errors. However, he began to split time at catcher with Roger Bresnahan in 1914 and 1915. After playing 77 games in 1916 and only two in 1917, Archer was released by the Cubs. Over the course of the 1918 season, he played for three separate teams. He signed as a free agent with the Pirates on March 10, and played 24 games with them. However, he only had a batting average of .155 during that time and was released. He later played for the Brooklyn Robins and Cincinnati Reds for nine games each until his retirement at the end of the season. In 847 games over 12 seasons, Archer posted a .249 batting average (660-for-2646) with 247 runs, 16 home runs, 299 RBI and 36 stolen bases. He recorded an overall .972 fielding percentage. In four World Series games, he hit only .143 (2-for-14). After his retirement from baseball, Archer worked as a hog purchaser for the Armour meat packing company in Chicago. He received a medal from the National Safety Council in 1931 after using prone pressure resuscitation to revive two truck drivers who had been overcome by carbon monoxide in the Union Stock Yards. Archer died at St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the age of 74, due to a blocked coronary artery following treatment for spinal tuberculosis. He was interred at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Boone, Iowa, his wife's hometown. He was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.

He was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Polish PEN Club. Representative of classicism and symbolism in the poetry of Young Poland, he was an author of many philosophical poems influenced by the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (from whom he translated several books into Polish), the ideas of Franciscan order as well as paradoxes of Christianity. Life Staff was born in Lw√≥w (then in the Austrian partition; now Lviv, Ukraine) during the military partitions of Poland. He was one of three children of the local confectioner of Czech & German origin. He studied law and philosophy at the Lw√≥w University, and in 1918 settled in Warsaw at the cusp of Poland's return to independence. He died at the age of 78 in Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna soon after the end of Stalinism in postwar Poland, and was buried in Warsaw at the renowned PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Staff was highly influential in the interwar period, including in the literary life of Julian Tuwim, one of Poland's best-known poets. He served as vice-president of the Polish Academy of Literature since 1933, and since 1949 resided in Warsaw. Literary career Staff's writing can be divided into three periods: Young Poland until 1918, Interwar period (1918‚Äì39), and postwar Poland (following the end of World War II). In the early 20th century, Staff became probably the most famous and influential Polish poet. He called his popularity a retiring, soft glory. He was also the main role-model for Polish group of experimental poets named Skamander (founded in 1918). In the 1950s, he moved to blank verse in line with the ideals of Polish avant-garde.

They were originally proposed by Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck as a teaching tool, but are also popular among expert designersMartin Fowler, UML Distilled, chapter 4 and recommended by extreme programming supporters.A concise introduction at extremeprogramming.org Martin Fowler has described CRC cards as a viable alternative to UML sequence diagram to design the dynamics of object interaction and collaboration. CRC cards are usually created from index cards. Members of a brainstorming session will write up one CRC card for each relevant class/object of their design. The card is partitioned into three areas: # On top of the card, the class name # On the left, the responsibilities of the class # On the right, collaborators (other classes) with which this class interacts to fulfill its responsibilities Using a small card keeps the complexity of the design at a minimum. It focuses designers on the essentials of the class and prevents them from getting into its details and implementation at a time when such detail is probably counter-productive. It also discourages giving the class too many responsibilities. Because the cards are portable, they can easily be laid out on a table and re-arranged while discussing a design.  Creating CRC cards  To create a CRC card, you can begin by writing out a scenario which identifies the major actors and actions which the actors do. Only write out actions and actors specific to that particular scenario. Nouns should turn into the classes of the card, verbs typically turn into the responsibilities of the card, and collaborators are the other cards with which the card will be interacting.

The plot follows the adventures of Link and Princess Zelda as they defend the kingdom of Hyrule from an evil wizard named Ganon. The series is heavily-based on the first game of the Zelda series, The Legend of Zelda, but includes some references to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the original game's sequel. The show was produced by DIC Enterprises and distributed by Viacom Enterprises in association with Nintendo of America, Inc. It comprises thirteen episodes which first aired in North America from September 8, 1989, to December 1, 1989. Show premise Each episode of The Legend of Zelda follows the adventures of the hero Link and Princess Zelda as they defend the kingdom of Hyrule from an evil wizard named Ganon, who somehow came into possession of the Triforce of Power (we hear in one episode that he \\"stole it fair and square\\"). Most episodes consist of Ganon (or his minions) either attempting to capture the Triforce of Wisdom from Zelda, kidnap Zelda, or otherwise conquer Hyrule. Curiously, the Triforce of Courage is never seen or even mentioned in the series. In some episodes, Link and Zelda are assisted and accompanied by a fairy-princess, Spryte. A common running joke of the series is Link's repeated failure to convince Zelda that he deserves a kiss for his heroic deeds. Whenever it seems they are going to kiss, they are interrupted. Although Link does kiss the clone of Zelda that Gannon creates in one episode and Zelda kisses Link in cross-over episodes of Captain N: The Game Master. While Link saves Zelda in a few episodes, she often fights beside him using a bow and arrow or a boomerang. Link usually meets Zelda's angry remarks with his sarcastic catchphrase, \\"Well, excuse me, Princess!\\". In the episode \\"Kiss'N Tell\\", Zelda uses a more elegant version reflective of her royal upbringing, \\"Well! Pardon me!\\" The series was to be continued, but was canceled along with The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!. The show is one of the few instances of Link having dialogue in The Legend of Zelda franchise. The games intentionally do not give Link dialogue. As Eiji Aonuma said, \\"since people have played Zelda over the years, they have their ideas of how Link might sound. If we were to put a voice in there that might not match up with someone else's image, then there would be a backlash to that. So we've tried to avoid that.\\" Voice cast * Jonathan Potts as Link * Cyndy Preston as Princess Zelda * Len Carlson as Ganon and Moblins * Colin Fox as King Harkinian * Allen Stewart-Coates as the Triforce of Power * Elizabeth Hanna as the Triforce of Wisdom * Paulina Gillis as Sprite and Sing * Don Francks as additional voices * Marvin Goldhar as additional voices * Christopher Ward as additional voices Episodes Game references The TV series is based heavily on The Legend of Zelda. While direct referencing of the game is loose, the series features some recognizable monsters, items, sound effects, tunes, and locations. Some references are also made to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. For example, in \\"The Ringer\\", Ganon is seen riding a Lowder, a beetle-like enemy seen in Zelda II. Although there is no direct explanation for how Link and Zelda are able to carry seemingly infinite numbers of items, the TV series shows that the items they carry magically shrink when they are placed in pouches or pockets. Rupees appear, but are called Rubies. Rather than arrows, the bows in the cartoon shoot beam-like projectiles. Just like in most of the games, Link's sword can shoot a beam attack. Link's beams can destroy most monsters, but not people, as shown in the episode \\"Sing for the Unicorn\\", when Link zaps Sing during a fight, but to no avail.

Home media =North American airings/DVDs= The Legend of Zelda was featured on every Friday episode of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! in place of the Super Mario Bros. cartoons. Each episode ran for about fifteen minutes. The series was made in association with Nintendo of America, produced by DIC Enterprises, and distributed for syndicated television by Viacom Enterprises (now CBS Television Distribution). Due to its syndicated nature, only one season of sixty-five episodes of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was made and Zelda was aborted after thirteen episodes. However, slightly modified versions of the characters of Link and Zelda, together with their original voice actors, were later transplanted into NBC's Saturday morning program Captain N: The Game Master, also produced by DIC Entertainment. In 1992, the episodes were time compressed (sped up) and played in double episode format on the Captain N & The Video Game Masters syndication block. Zelda episodes were rarely shown, but at least once, the episodes \\"Underworld Connections\\" & \\"Doppleganger\\" aired with the titles switched around. It was played in this block from 1992‚Äì1993 in syndication, and from 1993‚Äì1995 on USA Network. Clips previewing the episodes were shown in the middle of the live-action segments when the Mario cartoon was shown. These clips were cut out of the video releases and Yahooligans! TV, but were restored for the Super Mario Bros. Super Show DVD set (except for \\"King Mario of Cramalot\\"). Like with Super Show, Zelda was released onto VHS by Kids Klassics, who released the series on two-episode tapes in four volumes; the gold color of the VHS slipcases matched that of the original NES games. Lions Gate Home Entertainment also included an episode each on their \\"Mario's Monster Madness\\" and \\"Action Adventures\\" VHSes; both also included on their DVD counterpart \\"Mario's Greatest Movie Moments\\". Sterling Entertainment released another VHS/DVD titled Ganon's Evil Tower on July 22, 2003, which included three episodes. The DVD release also included 2 episodes of Sonic Underground as a bonus. The second DVD was released on September 27, 2005, titled Havoc in Hyrule, containing five episodes. The complete Zelda series was released on October 18, 2005 by Shout! Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, with extra bonus features such as interactive DVD games and line art from the series. However, it did not include all of the associated the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! live action segments; some were included as bonus features. This release has been discontinued and is out of print. NCircle Entertainment eventually re-released Sterling's DVDs, and released another one titled \\"The Power of the Triforce\\" on July 22, 2008, which contained five episodes. NCircle re-released the complete series on May 22, 2012. =United Kingdom= The Legend of Zelda was originally shown in the early 1990s on the early morning TV show TV-am. They were not commissioned for a second run. They were also shown on CITV in the 1990s within the Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, and on Channel 4 on its Sunday morning kids' line up, which included shows such as Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors. In 1992, Tempo Video released a set of two VHS tapes with three episodes per tape. The Legend of Zelda shared a tape with Captain N: The Game Master, which included the episode \\"Underworld Connections\\". There are currently no plans for a Region 2 DVD release. =Germany= PIDAX FILM released a Region 2 DVD of the show on December 2, 2016. The two-DVD set includes all 13 episodes in German and English Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Reception The series is notable for its negative reception. IGN rated the DVD release of The Legend of Zelda a 3.0, or \\"Bad\\", citing poor writing, repeated plots, and over the top acting. Link's catchphrase, \\"Well excuse me, Princess!\\" is an internet meme and commonly used in-joke used by video game players, especially Zelda fans, and is spoken by Link on 29 occasions throughout the 13 episodes. James Rolfe of Cinemassacre has shown a more positive response to the series. While acknowledging that the dialogue \\"can make you cringe\\", he favored Link and Zelda's characterizations and found the action satisfying. He labeled \\"The White Knight\\" as the best episode for showing Link's heroic nature against the more pompous and vain Prince Facade, but described the following episode \\"Kiss'N Tell\\" as his least favorite for Link complaining throughout.

Out of the 25 million samples tested, ClamAV scored 76.60% ranking 12 out of 19, a higher rating than some much more established competitors. In the 2008 AV-Test, which compared ClamAV to other antivirus software, it rated: on-demand: very poor; false positives: poor; response time: very good; rootkits: very poor. In a Shadowserver six-month test between June and December 2011, ClamAV detected over 75.45% of all viruses tested, putting it in fifth place behind AhnLab, Avira, BitDefender and Avast. AhnLab, the top antivirus, detected 80.28%. Unofficial databases The ClamAV engine can be reliably used to detect several kinds of files. In particular, some phishing emails can be detected using antivirus techniques. However, false positive rates are inherently higher than those of traditional malware detection. There are several unofficial databases for ClamAV: * Sanesecurity is an organization that maintains a number of such databases; in addition they distribute and classify a number of similar databases from other parties, such as Porcupine, Julian Field, MalwarePatrol.Sanesecurity Phishing, Scam and Malware signatures for ClamAV * SecuriteInfo.com also provides additional signatures for ClamAV.SecuriteInfo.com Add 4.000.000 signatures to ClamAV Antivirus ClamAV Unofficial Signatures are mainly used by system administrators to filter email messages. Detections of these groups should be scored, rather than causing an outright block of the \\"infected\\" message. Platforms =Linux, BSD= ClamAV is available for Linux and BSD-based operating systems. In most cases it is available through the distribution's repositories for installation. On Linux servers ClamAV can be run in daemon mode, servicing requests to scan files sent from other processes. These can include mail exchange programs, files on Samba shares, or packets of data passing through a proxy server. On Linux and BSD desktops ClamAV provides on-demand scanning of individual files, directories or the whole PC. =macOS= Apple macOS Server has included ClamAV since version 10.4. It is used within the operating system's email service. A paid-for graphical user interface is available from Canimaan Software Ltd in the form of ClamXav. Additionally, Fink, Homebrew and MacPorts have ported ClamAV. Another program which uses the ClamAV engine, on macOS, is Counteragent. Working alongside the Eudora Internet Mail Server program, Counteragent scans emails for viruses using ClamAV and also optionally provides spam filtering through SpamAssassin. =OpenVMS= ClamAV for OpenVMS is available for DEC Alpha and Itanium platforms. The build process is simple and provides basic functionality, including: library, clamscan utility, clamd daemon and freshclam for update. =Windows= ClamAV for Windows is now a part of the Immunet client produced by Cisco. Immunet is a real-time cloud based detection software, maintained by Cisco, which owns both ClamAV and Immunet. =OS/2= A port of ClamAV is available for OS/2 (including eComStation and ArcaOS) with a native UI written in REXX. Graphical interfaces Since ClamAV does not include a graphical user interface (GUI) but instead is run from the command line, a number of third-party developers have written GUIs for the application for various platforms and uses. These include: ClamTk 5.27 running on Lubuntu 19.04 * Linux **ClamTk using gtk2-perl; project is named for the Tk libraries that were used when it began **KlamAV for KDE, discontinued development in 2009 **wbmclamav is a webmin module to manage Clam AntiVirus *macOS **ClamXav is a port which includes a graphical user interfaces and has a \\"sentry\\" service which can watch for changes or new files in many cases. There is also an update and scanning scheduler through a cron job facilitated by the graphical interface. ClamXav can detect malware specific to macOS, Unix, or Windows. The ClamXav application and the ClamAV engine are updated regularly. ClamXav is written and sold by Canimaan Software Ltd. **Tiger Cache Cleaner is shareware software which installs and presents a graphic interface for using ClamAV to scan for viruses, and provides other unrelated functions. * Microsoft Windows **Immunet **ClamWin **CS Antivirus **Graugon AntiVirus **Clam Sentinel * OS/2 ** ClamAV- GUI =ClamWin= ClamWin running on Windows XP ClamWin is a graphical user interface front end for ClamAV for Microsoft Windows built by ClamWin Pty Ltd. Features include on-demand (user started) scanning, automatic updates, scan scheduling, context menu integration to Explorer, and an add-in for Microsoft Outlook. ClamWin does not provide on-access scanning, additional software must be used. Plugins for Mozilla Firefox which use ClamWin to scan downloaded files are also available. Several other extensions allow users to process downloaded files with any software and scan the files with ClamWin.Download Statusbar =Clam Sentinel= Clam Sentinel is a free software system tray application that detects file system changes and scans the files modified using ClamWin in real-time. It works with Windows 98/98SE/ME/XP/Vista/7/8. It features a real-time scanner for ClamWin, optional system change messages and proactive heuristic protection. Real-time file scanning Since Version 0.99, ClamAV supports on-access (real-time) scanning via the Linux kernel (version >= 3.8) module fanotify.https://blog.clamav.net/2016/03/configuring- on-access-scanning-in-clamav.html Alternatively, ClamAV can be used with other applications such as ClamFS (for any Unix-like operating system supporting FUSE) and Clam Sentinel (for Windows) to provide real-time checks. Patent lawsuit In 2008, Barracuda Networks was sued by Trend Micro for its distribution of ClamAV as part of a security package. Trend Micro claimed that Barracuda's utilization of ClamAV infringes on a software patent for filtering viruses on an Internet gateway. The free software community responded in part by calling for a boycott against Trend Micro. The boycott was also endorsed by the Free Software Foundation. Barracuda Networks counter-sued with IBM- obtained patents in July 2008. On May 19, 2011, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Final Rejection in the reexamination of Trend Micro's U.S. patent 5,623,600.

Details He was 19 years old, and a sergeant in the 4th Battalion, The Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, Duke of Albany's), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 20 July 1918 near Marfaux, France, Sergeant Meikle, single- handed and armed only with a revolver and a stick, rushed and put out of action a machine-gun which was delaying his company's advance. Shortly afterwards, seizing a rifle and bayonet from a fallen comrade, he charged another machine-gun post, but was killed almost on the gun position. His bravery enabled two other men who followed him to put this gun out of action.CWGC entry Memorial A memorial to John Meikle stands in Station Road, Dingwall. The inscription reads: \\"In memory of Sergt John Meikle V.C M.M late clerk at Nitshill Station who enlisted in H.M. Forces (Seaforth Highlanders) 8th February 1915 during the Great War and was killed in action on 20th July 1918. Erected by his railway comrades\\". The memorial formerly stood at Nitshill railway station and was unfortunately vandalised many times over the decades. It was moved to Levern Primary School in Nitshill, the local school John had attended and was on display in the school entrance for many years. When the school was to be demolished in 1997 the Head Teacher, Margaret Gallagher, contacted the Railway Authorities to enable the memorial to be saved for posterity. On 18 October 2016 a new memorial funded by the Railway Heritage Trust was unveiled at Nitshill Station by ScotRail Alliance MD Phil Verster with Sgt Meikle's nephews Alan and John Meikle.

In the U.S. it also refers to a principle in copyright law in which certain elements of a creative work are held to be not protected when they are mandated by or customary to the genre.Scenes a Faire Under Copyright Law. ‚Äì Ivan Hoffman, B.A., J.D. Examples in different genres For example, a spy novel is expected to contain elements such as numbered Swiss bank accounts, a femme fatale, and various spy gadgets hidden in wristwatches, belts, shoes, and other personal effects. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit interpreted the sc√®nes √† faire doctrine expansively to hold that a motion picture about the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin, and derelict cars to be perceived as realistic, and therefore a later film that duplicated these features of an earlier film did not infringe.Williams v. Crichton, 84 F.3d 581, 583 (2d Cir. 1996), commenting on Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159 (1986). These elements are not protected by copyright, though specific sequences and compositions of them can be. As another example, in computer programming, it is often customary to list variables at the beginning of the source code of a program. In some programming languages, it is required to also declare the type of variable at the same time. Depending on the function of a program, certain types of variables are to be expected. If a program deals with files, variable types that deal with files are often listed and declared. As a result, variable declarations are generally not considered protected elements of a program. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit made this part of the analysis for infringement of non-literal elements of computer code in Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992). In that case, the court added it into its Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test. Policy The policy rationale of the doctrine of sc√®nes √† faire is that granting a first comer exclusivity over sc√®nes √† faire would greatly hinder others in the subsequent creation of other expressive works. That would be against the constitutionally mandated policy of the copyright law to promote progress in the creation of works, and it would be an impediment to the public's enjoyment of such further creative expressions. By the same token, little benefit to society would flow from grants of copyright exclusivity over sc√®nes √† faire.See Short Tutorial Note on How the Merger Doctrine and Sc√®nes √† Faire Differently Address Relevant Market, in George Washington Univ. Computer Law. In a business and computer program context, the doctrine of sc√®nes √† faire is interpreted to apply to the practices and demands of the businesses and industries that the given computer program serves. Hence, the concepts of idea vs. expression (merger doctrine) and sc√®nes √† faire relate directly to promoting availability of business functionality.See, e.g., Engineering Dynamics, Inc. v. Structural Software, Inc., 46 F.3d 408, 410 n.2 (5th Cir. 1995). In CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties, Inc., 97 F.3d 1504 (1st Cir. 1996). the court compared the merger and sc√®nes √† faire doctrines. The court said that the two doctrines were similar in policy, in that they both sought to prevent monopolization of ideas. However, merger applied when idea and expression were inseparable, but sc√®nes √† faire applied despite separability where an external common setting caused use of common elements and thus similarity of expression.CCM Cable, 97 F.3d at 1522 n.25. Limits of doctrine The doctrine must be a matter of degree‚Äîthat is, operate on a continuum. Consider the Second Circuit's ruling that the sc√®ne √† faire for a movie about the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin (rats, in the accused and copyrighted works), and derelict cars. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the sc√®nes √† faire doctrine for South Bronx movies. Perhaps, cockroaches, gangs, and muggings are also part of the South Bronx sc√®ne √† faire, but further similarity such as the film having as characters \\"a slumlord with a heart of gold and a policeman who is a Zen Buddhist and lives in a garage\\" surely goes beyond the South Bronx sc√®ne √† faire. There must be some expression possible even in a cliche-ridden genre.\\" Cases *Cain v. Universal Pictures, 47 F.Supp. 1013 (United States District Court for the Southern District of California 1942) ::This was the case where the term was introduced, when the writer James M. Cain sued Universal Pictures, the scriptwriter and the director for copyright infringement in connection with the film When Tomorrow Comes. Cain claimed a scene in his book where two protagonists take refuge from a storm in a church had been copied in a scene depicting the same situation in the movie. Judge Leon Rene Yankwich ruled that there was no resemblance between the scenes in the book and the film other than incidental \\"sc√®nes √† faire\\", or natural similarities due to the situation. *Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986) ::After the release of the film Fort Apache, The Bronx, author Thomas Walker filed a lawsuit against one of the production companies, Time-Life Television Films (legal owner of the script), claiming that the producers infringed on his book Fort Apache (New York: Crowell, 1976. ). Among other things, Walker, the plaintiff, argued that: \\"both the book and the film begin with the murder of a black and a white policeman with a handgun at close range; both depict cockfights, drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes and rats; both feature as central characters third- or fourth-generation Irish policemen who live in Queens and frequently drink; both show disgruntled, demoralized police officers and unsuccessful foot chases of fleeing criminals.\\" But the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that these are stereotypical ideas, and that the United States copyright law does not protect concepts or ideas. The court ruling stated: \\"the book Fort Apache and the film Fort Apache: The Bronx were not substantially similar beyond [the] level of generalized or otherwise nonprotectible ideas, and thus [the] latter did not infringe copyright of [the] former.\\"Margolick, David. ‚Äì Legal Notes: \\"Writer Told 'Ft.

The case involved a commercial photographer, Joshua Ets-Hokin, who sued SKYY vodka when another photographer created advertisements with a substantially similar appearance to work he had done for them in the past. It was established that the similarity between his work and the later works of the photographer was largely mandated by the limited range of expression possible; within the constraints of a photo shoot for a commercial product there are only so many ways one may photograph a vodka bottle. In light of this, to establish copyright infringement, the two photos would have been required to be virtually identical. The originality of the later work was established by such minor differences as different shadows and angles.Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc.

Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993) ::A significant sc√®nes √† faire case in the computer program context is Gates v. Bando. The court explained the policy and application of the doctrine to computer program copyright infringement cases in these terms: > ::Under the sc√®nes √† faire doctrine, we deny protection to those expressions > that are standard, stock, or common to a particular topic or that > necessarily follow from a common theme or setting. Granting copyright > protection to the necessary incidents of an idea would effectively afford a > monopoly to the first programmer to express those ideas. Furthermore, where > a particular expression is common to the treatment of a particular idea, > process, or discovery, it is lacking in the originality that is the sine qua > non for copyright protection. ::The sc√®nes √† faire doctrine also excludes > from protection those elements of a program that have been dictated by > external factors. In the area of computer programs these external factors > may include: hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software > standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design > standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry > programming practices. * RG Anand v. M/s Deluxe Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613 ::The plaintiff was the writer and producer of a play called \\"Hum Hindustani\\" that was produced in the period of 1953-1955. The play was based on the evils of provincialism. The defendant in 1956 produced a film called \\"New Delhi\\". One of the themes of the film was provincialism, too. While evaluating whether or not the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's copyright, the Supreme Court of India held: > There can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, _themes_ , plots or > historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases > is confined to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea > by the author of the copyright work. (emphasis supplied) Therefore, the court held that there is a standard way of dealing with the theme of provincialism, and there can be no copyright over that theme. Consequently, a question of infringement does not even arise.

She has been the wife of German national economist, Edgar Jaff√©, and also lover of the Austrian phsychologist and anarchist Otto Gross (1877‚Äì1920), of German national economist and sociologist Alfred Weber (1868‚Äì1958) and his brother, German national economist and sociologist Max Weber (1864‚Äì1920). Else Freiin von Richthofen (October 8, 1874 - December 22, 1973) was among the early female social scientists in Germany. Life and career Elisabeth Helene Amalie Sophie Freiin (Baroness) von Richthofen (also known as Else Jaff√©) was born in Ch√¢teau-Salins (France). Her father was Friedrich Ernst Emil Ludwig Freiherr von Richthofen (1844-1915), an engineer in the German army, and Anna Elise Lydia Marquier (1852-1930). While Else von Richthofen started her professional career as a teacher, she enrolled at Heidelberg University at a time when this was still very unusual for women; she was one of just four female students at the time. She earned a doctorate in economics in 1901 and started to work as a labour inspector in Karlsruhe. She married (1865-1921), another former student of Max Weber, in 1902, and he was a well-known economist and entrepreneur. It was Jaff√© who bought the journal Archiv f√ºr Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik of which Max Weber became one of the editors. With Jaff√©, she had three children, Friedel (born 1903), Marianne (born 1905) and Hans (born 1909). Else became acquainted to intellectuals and authors, including the sociologists and economists Max Weber and Alfred Weber, the psychanalyst Otto Gross, the writer Fanny zu Reventlow and others. She started an affair with Otto Gross with whom she had a fourth child, Peter (1907-ca. 1915). She also had an affair with her former professor Max Weber and his brother Alfred Weber, with whom she lived together in the same house for several years after her husband died.

The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived; however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight almost without any outside assistance. Initially the battle raged throughout most of Warsaw, but after a short time it became confined to districts in the West of the town. The key factor in the battle was the massive imbalance of weapons between the two sides. The German side was extremely well equipped whilst the Polish side had, initially, barely enough ammunition for a few days. The policy of one bullet, one German allowed the Polish fighters to sustain the uprising for many weeks at the cost of their own lives. Some areas fought for a full 63 days before an agreed capitulation took place. The losses on the Polish side amounted to 18,000 soldiers killed, 25,000 wounded and over 250,000 civilians killed; those on the German side amounted to over 17,000 soldiers killed and 9,000 wounded. Although Stalingrad had already shown the level of danger which a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support to armies, the Warsaw uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against far better equipped professional soldiers-- though at the cost of vast sacrifices on the part of the city's residents.  W-hour  \\"W-hour\\" (from the Polish wybuch, \\"outbreak\\"), the moment of the start of the uprising, had been rescheduled for 1 August at 1700 during a briefing on 31 July around 1730. The change of \\"W-hour\\" from 2400 (in earlier plans) to 1700 proved to be a costly strategic decision, reducing the chance of surprising the Germans, especially since many of the Polish partisans were not trained for prolonged day fighting. The order to start the uprising did not reach all of the units (around 23,000 personnel) due to the technological and logistic limitations of the underground movement. First moves Home Army positions (in black) after five days' fighting, August 5, 1944. Fighting broke out before the \\"W-hour\\" (scheduled for 1700) in several places where German units encountered organising Polish forces: around 1400 on ≈ªoliborz, 1500 on Czerniak√≥w, 1600 around Plac Napoleona, Hale Mirowskie, Plac Kercelego marketplace, Okopowa street and Mokot√≥w. Until \\"W-hour\\" those separate incidents were not generally perceived as part of a bigger plan. However, around 1600 SS-Standartenfuhrer Paul Otto Geibel, chief of police and SS in the Warsaw District, received a warning about the uprising from an anonymous 'lieutenant of Luftwaffe', who had in turn been warned about it by a Polish woman. He alerted the units under his command, which thus were prepared for the assault at 1700. This drastically reduced the element of surprise of the resistance. On the other hand, while the Germans had been considering the possibility of an uprising, they had no operational plans prepared for such an occasion. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows: Area I (≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie, Stare Miasto): Units in that area captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture strong German pockets of resistance (the Warsaw University buildings, PAST skyscraper, or the headquarters of the German garrison at Pi≈Çsudski square). They thus failed to create a central stronghold and secure communications links for other areas. The main failures were in establishing a secure land connection with the northern area of ≈ªoliborz through the northern railway line and the Cytadela fortress as well as failure to capture the bridges over Vistula. The forces mobilized in the city centre also failed to capture the German-only area near the Szucha avenue. Area II (≈ªoliborz, Marymont, Bielany): Units here failed to secure the most important military targets in the area of ≈ªoliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although the main body of the area was captured, the soldiers of colonel ≈ªywiciel failed to capture the Cytadela fortress area and break through German defences at Warszawa Gda≈Ñska railway station. Area III (Wola): Units here initially succeeded in securing most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of colonel Rados≈Çaw managed to capture the German barracks, the German supplies depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the Jewish cemetery. Area IV (Ochota): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the Warsaw concentration camp on Gƒôsia street, SS barracks and Sipo barracks located in former Students House on Narutowicz square, nicknamed Alcatraz). After suffering heavy casualties most of the forces of the Armia Krajowa retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under lieut. Gustaw stayed in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Units of Kedyw managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German resistance from the south and west. Area V (Mokot√≥w): The situation in this area was very serious from the beginning of hostilities. The partisans were to capture the heavily defended and fortified so-called Police Area (Dzielnica policyjna) on Rakowiecka street. Also, they were to establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at Pola Mokotowskie. None of this succeeded. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokot√≥w, which was, however, severed from most communications routes to other areas. Area VI (Praga): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula. The main task of the Area VI (Obw√≥d VI) was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the situation was far worse than in other areas, there was no chance for any help from the outside. After some minor initial success, the forces of lt.col. Antoni W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªurowski were badly outnumbered by the German forces concentrated there. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces located in the Praga area went underground. After the Soviets finally reached the right bank of the Vistula on September 10, the officers proposed recreating the pre-war 36th 'Academic Legion' infantry regiment; however, they were all arrested by the NKVD and sent to Russia for interrogation. Area VII (Powiat Warszawski): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets. Zgrupowanie Kedywu Komendy G≈Ç√≥wnej: These units secured parts of ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie and Wola; along with the units of Area I, they were the most successful during the first few hours. Many primary targets were not achieved on the first and subsequent days. Those included the early plans to capture the PAST building and failed attacks on Okƒôcie, Pola Mokotowskie and Warszawa Gda≈Ñska train station. After the first several hours of fighting many units adopted a more defensive strategy, while the civilian population started erecting barricades throughout the city. German reinforcements The Uprising reached its apogee on August 4 when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish frontlines in the Wola and Ochota districts. However, they failed to secure the bridges over the Vistula or bridgeheads on the other side of the river. Also, there were still several German pockets of resistance inside the Polish-controlled territory, most notably the PAST skyscraper, the bridgeheads, and Headquarters of the police. On that very same day SS general Erich von dem Bach was appointed commander of all the forces fighting the uprising and began concentrating the newly arrived troops. These included Units of Dirlewanger, Schmidt and Reinefarth. The main aim of the German forces was to break through to the German bridgeheads and then cut off the Uprising from the river by attacking both southward and northward.  Wola Massacre  Postwar mass graves of civilians killed in the Wola Massacre. On August 5 the three German groups started their advance westward along Wolska and G√≥rczewska streets toward the main East-West communication line of Aleje Jerozolimskie Av. Their advance was halted, but the Reinefarth and Dirlewanger regiments started to carry out orders of Heinrich Himmler: behind the lines special groups of SS, police and Wehrmacht went from house to house shooting all inhabitants and burning their bodies. The aim of this policy was to crush the will to fight and put the uprising to an end without having to commit to heavy city fighting. In mass executions approximately 40,000 civilians were slaughtered. At the same time the Zo≈õka and Wacek battalions managed to capture the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Warsaw concentration camp. The area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On August 7 the German forces were joined by tanks, with civilians being used as human shields. After two days of heavy fights they managed to cut Wola in two and reach the Bankowy square. Until mid September, the Germans were shooting all captured resistance fighters on the spot. The main perpetrators were Oskar Dirlewanger and Bronislaw Kaminski, who committed the most cruel atrocities. After von dem Bachs arrived in Warsaw (August 7), it became clear that atrocities only stiffened the resistance and that some political solution should be found, considering the small forces at the disposal of the German commander. The aim was to gain a significant victory to show the Home Army the futility of further fighting and make them surrender. This did not succeed, but from the end of September on, some of the captured Polish soldiers were treated as POWs.  Ochota Massacre  Simultaneously with the German attack on Wola, the Kaminski Brigade started its onslaught on the Ochota district. The forces defending the area consisted of only two ill-equipped battalions, while the Germans were aided by tanks, artillery and Goliath self-propelled mines. However, the morale of German and Russian troops fighting in the area was low, and the main aim of the soldiers fighting there was to loot and rape rather than to attack enemy positions. As a result, the two battalions of the Home Army managed to defend the area with heavy casualties until August 11, when they retreated toward Mokot√≥w.  Old Town  Bank Polski in 2004, bearing the scars of the Uprising. The lighter-colored bricks were added during the building's reconstruction after 2003. The Old Town area (Polish Star√≥wka or Stare Miasto) was initially weak and almost undefended. However, it posed a great threat to the German-held bridgehead of the Kierbed≈∫ bridge. Also, the Polish positions were close enough to the northern railway line and the Cytadela stronghold to prevent the Germans from effectively using them. Knowing that, the Germans planned to cut off the Old Town both from the north (attack along the railway line toward Vistula) and from the south (attack from the Bankowy sq. Most Kierbedzia bridge). On August 9 the German units from the Mariensztat area managed to capture the Royal Castle, but failed to drive further inland. The Home Army counter-attacked and on August 12 forced the Germans out of Bankowy sq. However, German aerial bombardment and extensive usage of tanks imposed high casualties on both the defenders of the Old Town and the civilians. One of the first buildings to be bombed was a field hospital marked with a huge symbol of the Red Cross on the roof. A German attack from the north was also halted with heavy casualties on both sides. Heavy city fighting started in the area of Plac Bankowy, with the square and the nearby barricade at T≈Çomackie street changing hands several times. The Germans managed to establish a link with the German forces under siege in the building of the German Garrison (Mostowski Palace) on August 15, but the huge building became a scene of heavy door-to-door and room-to-room fights. The fights lasted until August 18 when both sides withdrew from the ruins. The no- mans-land and the covering positions of the Polish defence lines were composed of Warsaw Ghetto ruins and big open areas of Kercelego Square,http://www.sppw1944.org/index.html?http://www.sppw1944.org/kalendarium/0801.html ≈ªytnia street and Leszno street. The Home Army was not well enough equipped to withstand a German armoured attack in open field. However, the main positions in the Old Town were densely urbanised and covered with small, narrow streets. Because of that, after initial successes in taking the outer rim, the German advance was halted. However, Germans amassed large numbers of artillery for the constant bombardment of the area behind Polish lines. According to von dem Bach himself the number of guns used in the bombardment was as follows: * 220 guns of various calibres * 1 heavy mortar Thor 610mm * 50 Goliath self- propelled mines * 1 company of Nebelwerfer 42/43 * 1 battery of Wurfgranate of various calibres (ranging from 150mm to 320mm) * 4 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive- bombers operating from the Okƒôcie airportOne of the planes was shot down by Polish troops with hand guns on August 26. The usage of heavy artillery and constant air bombardment (the planes from Okƒôcie airport needed only five minutes to reach their targets) inflicted heavy casualties on the civilians and destroy the city itself. This aim was expressed in direct orders of Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Heinz Guderian. sewers (map) were used by Poles as evacuation routes to the ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie (City Center) and ≈ªoliborz districts. Despite German superiority, both technical and numerical, the Old Town was held until the end of August. However, the situation of both the Home Army and the civilians became critical: lack of food, water and munitions made further defence of the ruins impossible. Several plans to break through the German positions in Ogr√≥d Saski park to the downtown and through the northern railroad to ≈ªoliborz failed. On September 2 the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the sewers. More than 5,300 men and women were evacuated using this way. Loss of ≈ªoliborz and Old Town The front lines stabilised for a short while, but during the upcoming days and weeks the German counter- offensive would recapture ≈ªoliborz and the Old Town, splitting the area held by the resistance into three separate sectors, connected only by underground canals.  Sewers and barricades  The city sewer system became an important communication network for the insurgents, who used the sewers to move under the areas occupied by Germans, thus allowing contact between surrounded positions (insurgents had almost no radios). Sewers were also used as a means of evacuation of areas that couldn't be defended any longer. Hand-to-hand fighting took place in the pitch blackness, the Germans throwing grenades and gas bombs down manhole covers.Winston Spencer Churchill, The Second World War, Vol. 6, Chapter IX, The Martyrdom of Warsaw, 1955, Cassel Soviet \\"help\\": Berling's landings at Powi≈õle In September the eastern part of Warsaw had been captured by the Soviets. In the Praga area Polish units under command of general Zygmunt Berling (thus sometimes known as 'berlingowcy' - 'the Berling men'), the 1st Polish Army (1 Armia Wojska Polskiego) were in position. On the night of 14/15 September three patrols landed on the shore of Czerniak√≥w and Powi≈õle areas and made contact with Home Army forces. Under heavy German fire only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division). At the same time the commanders of the Red Army declined to support the Polish troops with artillery, tanks or bombers. The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, which could seriously compromise their line of defence, but weren't able to make any significant advances for several days, while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and during the next few days sustained heavy losses (including destruction of all landing boats and most of other river crossing equipment). Other Soviet units limited their assistance to sporadic and insignificant artillery and air support. Shortly after the Berling landings, the Soviets decide to postpone all plans for a river crossing in Warsaw \\"for at least 4 months\\", and soon afterwards General Berling was relieved of his command. On the night of September 19, after no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the promised evacuation of wounded did not take place, Home Army soldiers and landed elements of Wojsko Polskie were forced to begin a retreat from the positions on the bank of the river. Out of approximately 3,000 men who made it ashore only around 900 made it back to the eastern shores of Vistula, approximately 600 of them seriously wounded.  Airdrops  From 4 August the Western Allies begun supporting the Warsaw Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies. Initially the air supply operations were carried out mostly by Polish bomber units (Polish Special Duty Squadron 1586) stationed in Bari and Brindisi in Italy. Later on at the insistence of the Polish government-in- exile they were joined by South African and British units. The drops continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops was 104 tons. The Soviet Union did not give permission to the Allies for use of its airfields for those supply operations; thus the planes were forced to use distant bases in the United Kingdom and Italy, which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies' specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August (he referred to the resistance as 'a handful of criminals'). United States planes did not join the operation. After Stalin's objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegrammed Roosevelt on August 25, proposing to send planes in defiance of Stalin and 'see what happens'. Roosevelt replied on August 26: 'I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe'. Allied airmen lost over Warsaw. Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, except for elements of JG52, the highest-scoring fighter squadron (geschwader) in the Luftwaffe, which claimed its 10,000th kill of the war on a Soviet plane over the Warsaw suburb of Praga, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost. Most of the drops were made at night-time, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded in German-controlled territory. From 13 September on the Soviets begun their own airdrop raids with supplies, and dropped about 55 tons in total. The drops continued until 28 September. Since the Soviet airmen did not equip the containers with parachutes, the majority of recovered packages were damaged. Finally on 18 September the Soviets allowed one USAAF flight of 110 B-17s of the 3 division Eighth Air Force to re-fuel at Soviet airfields used in Operation Frantic, but it was too little too late. A large air-drop from high altitude fell predominantly into German hands. Of the total of 239 tons of supplies dropped during the 8 weeks by 306 planes of the western Allies, only 88 Tons (36.8%) actually reached the Home Army in Warsaw, the Kabacki woods and the Kampinos forest.tabulation in history of the Uprising The remainder fell into enemy hands or was lost. Capitulation At 8 pm on 2 October General Tadeusz B√≥r- Komorowski signed the capitulation of remaining Polish forces in Warsaw (Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej or Home Army Warsaw Corps) at the German headquarters in the presence of General von dem Bach.Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski, Secret Army p369. Gollancz, 1951 According to the capitulation treaty the Home Army soldiers were to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and the civilian population was to be treated humanely.

Its members were Shawn Christensen (vocals, rhythm guitar), Amanda Tannen (bass, vocals), Arthur Kremer (drums, percussion, keyboards), and Michael Jurin (lead guitar, vocals). History The band was formed in March 2000 from a previous musical effort, the band Ghistor, formed while studying art and design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. A few years later, after a chance meeting with Jurin, who had recently relocated to Brooklyn and had left his former band Charlotte's Funeral behind in his hometown of Philadelphia, the former classmates reunited, this time with Christensen on vocals. The band was named after an old purple hearse parked in Poughkeepsie, where Christensen grew up. Stellastarr played its first gig at Luna Lounge, formerly on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in July 2000, and released a limited series of independent/homemade EP CDs shortly thereafter. The band has toured with Jane's Addiction, The Raveonettes, Placebo, The Killers, and Editors. Stellastarr has played live in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Europe. The third album, Civilized, was released in July 2009 on the band's own label, Bloated Wife. \\"Graffiti Eyes\\" and \\"Numbers\\" are the singles, the last one has a B-side that includes \\"Winter Song\\". Since the release of the album, the band has been on indefinite hiatus. Members of the band have collaborated with Project Runway winner Christian Siriano and his boyfriend, musician Brad Walsh on music for Siriano's runway shows at fashion week.

Sharpers vary from what are now known as con-men by virtue of the simplicity of their cons, which often were impromptu, rather than carefully orchestrated, though those certainly happened as well. The 1737 Dictionary of Thieving Slang defines a sharper as \\"A Cheat, One who lives by his wits.\\" In the nineteenth century, and into today, the term is more closely associated with gambling. Sharpers were romantic figures in the eighteenth-century, valued as imaginative figures for their perceived social independence and ability to create new social networks of gangs. The appeal of an independent society, operating outside the law, has been imaginatively evocative for centuries, but in eighteenth-century London philosophical thought, influenced by Thomas Hobbes and Rousseau's new formulations of social contract, the romanticization of thievery reached new levels. John Gay's The Beggar's Opera and Henry Fielding's novel Jonathan Wild are only two examples of sharpers as heroes, in these cases, to provide satirical ammunition against the British Prime Minister Robert Walpole.

History In 1991, Andy Chase placed an ad that attracted fellow multi-instrumentalist Adam Schlesinger. In 1994 they met Dominique Durand, a native of Paris who had moved to New York City to study English, and with whom they shared admiration for The Go-Betweens, The House of Love, The Pastels, Prefab Sprout and The Smiths. Although Durand had never sung in a group, she was persuaded by Chase and Schlesinger to sing on some demos, and Ivy was formed. =Lately and Realistic= In 1994, Ivy signed with Seed Records and released \\"Get Enough,\\" which the UK magazine Melody Maker named Single of the Week, followed by the EP Lately. In 1995, they released their first full-length album, Realistic. Lately's cover version of \\"I Guess I'm Just a Little Too Sensitive\\" impressed its author, Edwyn Collins of Orange Juice, so much that he invited them to tour together. Ivy also toured during this period with Lloyd Cole, Madder Rose, and Saint Etienne.\\"Ivy (biography)\\" =Apartment Life= Apartment Life (released October 6, 1997 on Atlantic Records) was praised by critics as one of the year's best albums and established Ivy as a band that wrote pleasant, well-crafted pop songs. They were assisted by several guest musicians, including Lloyd Cole, James Iha, Dean Wareham and Chris Botti. The album received more attention when \\"This Is the Day\\" and \\"I Get the Message\\" appeared on the soundtrack for the movie There's Something About Mary. Apartment Life, however, did not produce any hits, and Ivy was dropped by Atlantic. They signed with 550 Music on the condition that the band reissue the album. According to Schlesinger, four of the songs were remixed and the album was remastered and re-released on October 7, 1998.\\"New Album From Ivy\\" =Long Distance= Long Distance, their third LP, was released on July 10, 2001 on Nettwerk, and won the group a wider audience both at home and abroad. The album was released on November 8, 2000 in Japan, seven months prior to its US release, and the Japanese edition included a bonus track, \\"It's All in Your Mind\\" (the US version included The Blow Monkeys cover \\"Digging Your Scene\\" as a bonus track instead). On Long Distance, lush soundscapes and dense rhythm tracks were brought to the fore, and bouncy pop songs were outnumbered by moodier, more atmospheric songs like single \\"Edge of the Ocean\\". Promotional videos were created for that song and the lead single, \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\". By this time, the band had also found success on both the big and small screens, scoring the Farrelly Brothers‚Äô Shallow Hal, as well as having their songs featured prominently in numerous films and television shows. Chase and Schlesinger had also begun to receive attention for their work outside the band: Chase produced the debut album by French pop group Tahiti 80, which was a hit in many countries and led to production work with several other groups; Schlesinger‚Äôs other band, Fountains of Wayne, released two critically acclaimed records, and he also received an Oscar nomination for his title song to Tom Hanks's film That Thing You Do!. =Guestroom= Ivy released Guestroom on September 10, 2002 on Minty Fresh. The album contained 10 of the group's favorite cover songs, including The Cure's \\"Let's Go to Bed\\", House of Love's \\"I Don't Know Why I Love You\\", Steely Dan's \\"Only a Fool Would Say That\\", Serge Gainsbourg's \\"L'Anamour\\" (previously a B-side on the \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" single), The Ronettes' \\"Be My Baby\\" and Papas Fritas' \\"Say Goodbye\\". Picking from several different eras, they revealed some of their sources of inspiration, and also displayed their ability to reinterpret many different types of songs in their own distinct way. Five of the 10 songs on Guestroom were recorded during one group of sessions in New York. The remaining five tracks were recorded at different times over the course of Ivy‚Äôs career, but were difficult to find, having been released only on limited-edition singles, compilations or soundtracks. \\"Digging Your Scene\\" was also included on the album, and released in Japan and UK as a CD single. A video for \\"Let's Go to Bed\\" was shot, depicting Durand and Chase in their NYC apartment, later joined by Iha. The Lately EP was reissued in 2003 on Unfiltered Records with the same track list as the original. Ivy gained even wider recognition in 2003‚Äì2004 for their song \\"Worry About You\\", which was used as the theme song of the Stephen King series Kingdom Hospital and in the pilot episode of the television series The 4400. =In the Clear= In the Clear was released on March 1, 2005 on Nettwerk. Ivy brought in UK producer Steve Osborne (New Order, Happy Mondays, Starsailor, Elbow) for his first-ever New York sessions to mix seven of the tracks. In the Clear also featured guest appearances by friends like Iha, Porter, Brazilian string arranger Z√© Luis (Bebel Gilberto, Caetano Veloso), and former Girls Against Boys frontman Scott McLoud, who dueted with Durand on the closing track, \\"Feel So Free\\". The album was given a warmer reception than previous releases. An animated promotional video clip was created for \\"Thinking About You\\". =All Hours= All Hours was released on September 20, 2011 on Nettwerk. The first single from the album, \\"Distant Lights\\", was released on June 7, 2011, and the second single, \\"Fascinated,\\" was released on July 26, 2011. The third and final single, \\"Lost in the Sun\\", was released on April 10, 2012. Influences Ivy have cited The Go-Betweens, Burt Bacharach, Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, Orange Juice, The Smiths, The Velvet Underground & Nico, The Beatles and Fran√ßoise Hardy as influences, as well as other artists covered on Guestroom. Durand's vocal technique and Parisian pronunciation are often compared by reviewers to another French singer, L√¶titia Sadier of Stereolab. Other work Schlesinger was also a member of the bands Fountains of Wayne and Tinted Windows. Durand and Chase, with Michael Hampton, recorded one album, 2004's This Is Where We Live, as Paco. Chase's solo project, called Brookville, released three albums: Wonderfully Nothing (2003), Life in the Shade (2006) and Broken Lights (2009). In November 2012, Brookville changed their name to Camera2, releasing the \\"Just About Made It\\" single, followed by EP releases in 2013 and 2014.

The territory historically encompassed British Somaliland, Italian Somaliland, French Somaliland (now Djibouti), the Somali Region in the Ethiopian Empire and the Northern Frontier District Now North Easten Province in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya. At the present day, it encompasses Northern De facto Somaliland, southern Somalia, eastern Djibouti, the Somali region and Dire Dawa in Ethiopia, and the Lamu, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera Counties (all except Lamu formed part of the former North Eastern Province, which was abolished in 2013) in Kenya.  History  Since the beginning of the 20th century the concept of Greater Somalia started to be developed with the birth of the nation of Somalia, as a united country inhabited by all the Somali clans in their \\"Horn of Africa\\" areas. Pan-Somalism refers to the vision of reunifying these areas to form a single Somali nation. The pursuit of this goal has led to conflict: Somalia engaged after World War II in the Ogaden War with Ethiopia over the Somali Region, and supported Somali insurgents against Kenya. In 1946 the Somali Youth League selected Harar as the future capital of Greater Somalia and subsequently sent delegates to the United Nations office in Mogadishu to reveal this proposal. =Italian Somalia= Italians occupied the Benadir in 1890 and soon started to enlarge their Somalia italiana (Italian Somaliland): they created their colony in the first years of the 20th century from Cape Guardafui to the Juba river. During World War I, Britain secretly reached an agreement with Italy to transfer to the Italians 94,050 square kilometers of the Jubaland protectorate, which was situated in present- day southwestern Somalia. This was Italy's reward for allying itself with Britain in its war against Germany. The treaty was honored, and in 1924, Britain ceded Jubaland. The Italian \\"Grande Somalia\\" enlarged borders during World War II In 1926, the northern half of Jubaland was incorporated into Italian Somaliland, and was later re-dubbed Oltre Giuba by the Italians.Alex Thomson, \\"An Introduction to African Politics\\", 2 edition, (Routledge: 2000), p.23 Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD). After its conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, Italy also annexed the Ogaden region.Tripodi, Paolo. The Colonial Legacy in Somalia p. 104 (New York, 1999) In this way Italian Somaliland, with capital Mogadishu, was enlarged for the third time. In early World War II, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland and ejected the British.Federal Research Division, Somalia: A Country Study, (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2004), p.38 Benito Mussolini annexed the conquered area to the Italian Somalia and added even the area of Moyale and Buna near the Jubaland in eastern Kenya. In August 1940 Mussolini boasted to a group of Somalis in Rome that with the conquest of British Somalia (that he annexed to Italian Somalia) nearly all the Somali people were united, fulfilling their dream of a union of all Somalis.Antonicelli, Franco. Trent'anni di storia italiana 1915 - 1945. p. 47 In September 1940 he even announced to the Somali people in Italy of having created an Italian Grande Somalia inside his Italian Empire. Indeed, in early World War II, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland and ejected the British. However, Britain retained administration of most of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District.Africa Watch Committee, Kenya: Taking Liberties, (Yale University Press: 1991), p.269 Italians even did a tentative to occupy French Somaliland in summer 1940. However the British regained control of British Somaliland in the spring of 1941, and conquered Italian Somaliland and the [Somali Region]. In 1945, the Potsdam conference was held, where it was decided not to return Italian Somaliland to Italy. The UN opted instead in 1949 to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland for a period of ten years, after which time the region would be independent.Aristide R. Zolberg et al., Escape from Violence: Conflict and the Refugee Crisis in the Developing World, (Oxford University Press: 1992), p.106 Meanwhile, in 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of Somalis, the British \\"returned\\" the Hawd (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably \\"protected\\" by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Somali Region to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by Somali clans.David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.73 Britain included the proviso that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands that it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.75 =Somali Republic= A poster showing Somali Region and the rest of the Greater Somalia united in one country The first armed conflict following the independence and unification of the former British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland territories, known collectively as the Somali Republic, began in 1963 in an ethnic Oromo and Somali district, Elekere, then part of Bale province, instigated by the Oromo founder of the United Liberation Forces of Oromia, Waqo Gutu. The Bale revolt, a peasant revolt stemming from issues involving land, taxation, class, and religion,Gebru Tareke, Ethiopia: Power and Protest: Peasant Revolts in the Twentieth Century. Cambridge: Cambridge Press, 1991. raged in the province for several years until a number of developments took the energy out of the militants, as well as the decision of Somali Prime Minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal to focus his country's resources on economic development. Rebels began to surrender to the Ethiopian government at the end of 1969; Waqo Gutu, who had been the foremost of the insurgents, was surrounded with his command of barely 200 men in Arana by the Ethiopian army in February 1970 and surrendered. Pacification was complete by the next year.The details of this paragraph are based on Paul B. Henze Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 263f. Djibouti gained its independence in 1977, but a referendum was held in 1958 on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960 to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favor of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined \\"yes\\" vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. However, the majority of those who voted \\"no\\" were Somalis who were strongly in favor of joining a united Somalia as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali who campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, wound up as Djibouti's first president post-independence (1977‚Äì1991).Lowell Barrington, After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States, (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115 Between 1977-1978, Somalia and Ethiopia waged a war over control of the predominantly Somali Ogaden region. In 1978 and with the help of Soviet and Cuban troops, Ethiopian troops drove back the Somali army from the Ogaden, effectively marking the end of the Ogaden War. In 1981, Siad Barre visited Nairobi, and asserted that Somalia was suspending its claim on the North Eastern Province (NFD). Improved relations with Kenya led to the signing of a pact in December 1984 agreeing to cease hostilities along the border. Following renewed hostilities in the Ogaden with an August 1982 border clash,Somalia, 1980-1996 ACIGEthiopian-Somalian Border Clash 1982 OnWar.com Ethiopia and Somalia signed a peace treaty in 1988.  Somali Civil War  Current political situation of Somalia, as of July 6, 2014 With the start of the Somali Civil War, the vision of uniting the various historically and predominantly Somali-inhabited areas of the Horn of Africa into a Greater Somalia was temporarily sidelined. Thousands of refugees have been granted political asylum in Kenya. Talk of pan-Somali unification movements for the moment took a backseat, as the Republic splintered into a few autonomous smaller regional or clan-based governing zones. The government of the secessionist region of Somaliland in northwestern Somalia has consistently attempted to break away from the Somali Republic and launched an unsuccessful though persistent campaign to seek recognition from international organizations and countries. Somaliland further clashed with Puntland over control of the Sool and Sanaag regions. Though there was no unified government and thus no formal policy towards irredentism, individual militia leaders clashed with Ethiopian troops between 1998 and 2000.Ethiopia Middle East Desk  Islamic Courts Union  In late 2006, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, head of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) that then controlled much of southern Somalia, declared, \\"We will leave no stone unturned to integrate our Somali brothers in Kenya and Ethiopia and restore their freedom to live with their ancestors in Somalia.\\" These aims were sidelined after the decisive defeat of the ICU in the Battle of Baidoa and the subsequent actions of the War in Somalia by the allied forces of the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG), the autonomous governing zones of Puntland, Southwestern Somalia, Jubaland, and Galmudug and their military backer, Ethiopia. The Islamic Courts split into two factions. One faction wanted to sign a peace deal and merge with the TFG, while the other sought to defeat the Ethiopian troops and expel the African Union soldiers before any peace agreements.

Inishowen is the largest peninsula on the island of Ireland. The Inishowen peninsula includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head.

Colhoun, Mabel R. 1995. \\"The heritage of Inishowen: its archaeology, history and folklore.\\" (Londonderry): North West Archaeological and Historical Society. It is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by Lough Foyle, and to the west by Lough Swilly. It is joined at the south to the rest of the island and is mostly in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. The south-eastern part of the peninsula lies in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, having been transferred from County Donegal at the behest of the London companies as part of the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century. The peninsula is separated from the rest of Northern Ireland by the River Foyle. After the last ice age the peninsula was an island. Most of Inishowen's population inhabit the peripheral coastal areas, while the interior consists of low mountains, mostly covered in bogland, the highest of which is Slieve Snaght which is 619 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Other major hills are located in the Malin Head peninsulaHomer, Peter. A Brief History of Malin Head. Inishowen Maritime Museum & Planetarium. 2014., as well as the Urris Hills in west Inishowen. Due to its geography, Inishowen usually has relatively more moderate weather conditions, with temperatures slightly lower than other parts of Ireland in summer, and slightly warmer in winter, especially during periods of extended cold weather. Looking across the mouth of Lough Foyle to Dunagree Point and Inishowen Head Inishowen has several harbours, some of which are used for commercial fishing purposes, including Greencastle, Bunagee and Leenan. A seasonal ferry service crosses the Foyle, connecting Greencastle with Magilligan in County Londonderry, while another crosses the Swilly, connecting Buncrana with Rathmullan. The village of Fahan has a privately built marina. There are several small outlying islands off the Inishowen coast, most notably Inishtrahull and Glashedy islands, both uninhabited, although the former was inhabited until the early twentieth century. Inch, located in Lough Swilly, is technically no longer an island, as it has a causeway connecting it to the mainland at Tooban, south of Fahan. Lough Swilly is a fjord-like lough, and was of strategic importance for many years to the British Empire as a deep-water harbour. It is also famous as the departure point of the Flight of the Earls. Lough Foyle is important as the entrance to the river Foyle, and the city of Derry, but is much more shallow than Lough Swilly, and requires the use of a guide boat to guide ships to and from Londonderry Port. A large area of land, most of which now forms part of Grian√°n Farm, one of the largest farms in Ireland, was reclaimed from a shallow area of Lough Swilly, stretching from the village of Burnfoot to Bridgend and Burt. The outline of this land is plainly visible due to its flatness, showing a marked contrast to the more mountainous area surrounding it. History The Grian√°n of Aileach is a stone fort on the Inishowen peninsula. Buncrana is the largest town in Inishowen and second largest in County Donegal Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century) described a point called ŒüœÖŒµŒΩŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ (Wenniknion, perhaps from *wen- \\"friends\\") which probably referred to Inishowen.http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf Predating the formation of County Donegal by centuries, the area was named Inis Eoghain (the Island of Eoghan) after E√≥gan mac N√©ill, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages (Niall Naoigeallach, a High King of Ireland), whose name was also used for Tyrone (Irish: T√≠r Eoghain). Inis Eoghain is also the ancient homeland of the Meic Lochlainn (descended from the tribe of Eoghan), a clan that grew so formidable that they eventually came under siege by a Limerick King, who came north to Aileach, and ordered the destruction of Aileach fort, and that each soldier was to carry away a stone from the fort in order to prevent its rebuilding. Later, after the decline of the Meic Lochlainn, the Norman Earldom of Ulster expanded into Inishowen, founding Greencastle in the process. After the Bruce invasion in the early 14th-century, the √ì Dochartaigh clan (descended from the tribe of Conaill), gradually conquered it as they lost their own homeland in the Laggan valley area of T√≠r Conaill. Inishowen has many historical monuments, dating back to early settlements, and including the ruins of several castles, and the fort at Grian√°n Aileach. The ancient Grian√°n Ailigh fort at Burt was the one time seat of the High Kings of Ireland, including both High Kings of the Meic Lochlainn, who held power in Inis Eoghain for many centuries. It was restored in the nineteenth century, although some damage in recent years has resulted in the partial collapse of the south side wall. Among the main castle ruins of Inishowen are Carrickabraghey on the Isle of Doagh, the Norman Castle at Greencastle, Inch Castle, Buncrana Castle and Elagh Castle. In 1196, John de Courcy, an Anglo- Norman knight who had invaded Ulster in 1177, defeated the King of the Cen√©l Conaill and most of County Donegal was at his mercy. Two years later he returned to devastate Inishowen. However, in subsequent campaigns de Courcy was defeated by the O'Neill clan led by their chief √Åed M√©ith and found himself unable to conquer the western part of Ulster. In 1608 Sir Cahir O'Doherty, the last Chief of the Name of Clan O'Doherty and Lord of Inishowen, launched O'Doherty's Rebellion by burning Derry. After the defeat of the uprising, most of Clan O'Doherty's territory was awarded to Arthur Chichester. Ireland's deadliest road accident happened at Inishowen in July 2010.According to The Irish Times, \\"National Roads Authority road safety expert Stephen Lambert said last night's death toll was the highest number of fatalities in a single crash since records began in 1961\\". Demographics At the last Census of Ireland in 2016, Inishowen counted a population of 40,544 Buncrana is the largest town in Inishowen, with a 2016 population of 3,396 in its urban area. Politics On a national level, Inishowen forms part of the Donegal constituency, which elects five TDs to D√°il √âireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament). At the county level, Inishowen is an electoral area, a Municipal District, electing nine councillors to Donegal County Council. Currently there are three members of Fianna F√°il, two each of Sinn F√©in and Fine Gael, one from the Labour Party and one independent. Media In addition to the radio stations and newspapers available elsewhere in Donegal, there are several media outlets that are based solely on the peninsula, including two newspapers (the Inish Times and the Inishowen Independent, both of which are published in Buncrana) and one online daily local news service (InishowenNews.com). The traditional news source for Inishowen is the Derry Journal, published in nearby Derry city, since 1772. It still serves the peninsula as a paper of record. Tourism Inishowen sunset Sheep grazing at Inishowen Head Lighthouse at Dunagree Point Inishowen is at the starting (or ending) point of the Wild Atlantic Way. The Inishowen 100 tourist route is an approximately 100-mile signposted scenic drive around the peninsula. It takes in or passes nearby many of the tourist sights and places of interest on the peninsula. It starts at Bridgend where there is a lay-by with a large map and information boards. The first leg of the coastal route is along the coast of Lough Swilly. It passes Inch Island, Fahan (a blue flag beach), Fahan 18-hole Golf Course, Buncrana Town, Tullyarvan Mill (An interpretive centre tracing over 250 years of textile production in the Buncrana area.). It continues along the western coast on Lough Swilly. The routes passes Dunree beach, Dunree Fort (military museum) and then turns inland for Mamore Gap (between the Urris Hills and Raghtin More mountain), Leenan Bay, Dunaff, Head, Tullagh Bay (a blue flag beach), through the villages of Clonmany and Ballyliffin. Ballyliffin has an 18-hole golf course. The route then passes the Isle of Doagh (where there is a famine museum and an interpretive centre). Next is Carndonagh - the second largest town in Inishowen, after which the route turns North again through Malin Town, past Five Fingers Strand and then up onto cliff top viewpoint at Knockamany Bens, then down again to sea level with the route looking out into the Atlantic, before heading to Ireland's most northerly point Malin Head. On the North Eastern coast the route passes through Culdaff village and Culdaff Bay (another Blue Flag beach), Tramone Bay, and Kinnagoe Bay. Further East, it reaches Lough Foyle and then Greencastle (a port used by fishing boats and a landing point for the car ferry from Magilligan in Northern Ireland). Then, as the road heads South along Lough Foyle, it passes through Moville town, Quigley's Point and the village of Muff. =Museums= The Famine Village on the Isle of Doagh in Lagacurry takes visitors on a tour from famine days of the 1840s to the present.

The station is located on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between West Finchley and East Finchley stations; it is the junction for the short branch to Mill Hill East. The station is around 7 miles north-northwest of Charing Cross and is in Travelcard Zone 4. The station was opened on 22 August 1867 as part of the Great Northern Railway's line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of London Underground's Northern Heights plan, Northern line trains started serving the station in 1940 and main line passenger services ended in 1941. History =Original station= Finchley Central station before the construction of the branch to High Barnet on an alt=A map shows a station with a few buildings nearby, but surrounded mostly by fields Finchley Central station was built by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&LR;) on its line from Finsbury Park to Edgware. As construction of the line was nearing completion and before it opened it was purchased in July 1867 by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR), whose main line from King's Cross ran through Finsbury Park on its way to Potters Bar and the north. The station, originally named Finchley and Hendon, opened along with the railway to Edgware on 22 August 1867 in what was then rural Middlesex. It was north-northwest of Charing Cross as the crow flies, and from the GNR terminus at King's Cross.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. A branch line from Finchley Central to High Barnet was constructed by the GNR and opened on 1 April 1872. After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies, the GNR became part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. The station was renamed by the GNR twice: to Finchley on 1 February 1872 and Finchley (Church End) on 1 February 1894. It was given its current name on 1 April 1940. At the start of the 1930s the station had around 54 trains daily from High Barnet running to Finsbury Park and then either King's Cross, Moorgate or Broad Street. Trains between Finchley Central and Edgware typically operated as a shuttle, although some trains ran through to the terminals. =Northern Heights plan= In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) announced a proposal, which became known as the Northern Heights plan, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to the Northern line with new tunnels from the Northern line's terminus at Archway to East Finchley and to the Northern City line with a new surface connection between Drayton Park and Finsbury Park. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for electrification and reconstruction on 11 September 1939. The station was first served by electric Northern line trains on 14 April 1940 when the service was extended from East Finchley to High Barnet. After a period where the station was serviced by both operators, LNER steam services were ended on 2 March 1941. Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, completion of the electrification works on the line to Edgware was slowed and was completed only as far as Mill Hill East. Northern line services to Mill Hill East began on 18 May 1941 to serve the nearby Inglis Barracks. =Postwar= alt=A coloured map shows proposed new railway routes superimposed in red on a map of existing railway lines After the war, the plans to complete the Northern Heights works were reviewed but were not restarted. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest demand for LPTB funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. A government-commissioned review of rail transport in the London area produced a report in 1946 that proposed many new lines. It anticipated that completion of the Northern Heights works would put pressure on the Northern line's capacity and it proposed that a relief line should be considered for one or other of the two branches. One of these, designated Route 12B, was proposed to run as a tube line in tunnel from Finchley Central to Clapham Junction via Golders Green, St John's Wood, Baker Street, Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights plan. The proposal for Route 12B was also not developed by the LPTB or its successor organisations. Before the war, Charles Holden and Reginald Uren designed replacement station buildings to be built on both sides of the road bridge at the north end of the station. The curtailment of the Northern Heights Plan means that the rebuilding work was not implemented and the station still retains much of its original Victorian architectural character today. As one of two EH&LR; stations retaining its original buildings (the other is Mill Hill East), it is one of the oldest parts of the Underground system, pre- dating the first tunnelled section of the Northern line (the City & South London Railway) by more than twenty years. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) continued to operate goods trains from Finsbury Park to the station's goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed. The station today The station has two entrances. The main one, in the original station building, is on the north side of the tracks in Chaville Way, a short access road from the junction of Ballards Lane, Regents Park Road and Nether Street. The second entrance is to the south of the tracks in Station Road. The station is in a cutting and the two entrances are joined by a footbridge over the tracks from which stairs and lifts connect to the platforms. The station is accessible for disabled passengers travelling in both directions. The station has three platforms. Platforms 1 and 2, which share an island platform, are for northbound trains: platform 1 is used mainly by trains terminating at Finchley Central (and trains reverse using a reversing siding north of the station) or going to Mill Hill East; platform 2 is mainly used by trains going to High Barnet. Platform 3, a side platform, is for southbound trains. All platforms have canopies at their northern ends. The large station car park on the north side of the tracks, with access from Chaville Way, occupies the site of the former goods yard. Services and connections The station is in Travelcard Zone 4, between West Finchley and East Finchley on the Northern line. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3‚Äì7 minutes between 05:44 and 01:05 northbound to High Barnet and 05:31 and 01:15 southbound to Kennington (via Charing Cross) or Morden (via Bank). Trains to Mill Hill East operate between 05:16 and 01:06 (except for peak hours and after 23.00 all trains operate as a shuttle between Finchley Central and Mill Hill East). London Bus routes 13, 125, 143, 326, 382 and 460, night route N20, and school routes 626 and 683 serve the station. Cultural references alt=A circular plaque on a brick wall with the words: \\"In memory of Harry Beck the originate of the distinctive London Underground map who lived near here and used the station regularly.

Suppose :X_1,\\\\dots,X_n \\\\, are independent random variables that are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1]. Let :X_{(1)},\\\\dots,X_{(n)} \\\\, be the corresponding order statistics, i.e., the result of sorting these n random variables into increasing order. We seek the probability of some event A defined in terms of these order statistics. For example, we might seek the probability that in a certain seven-day period there were at most two days in on which only one phone call was received, given that the number of phone calls during that time was 20\\\\. This assumes uniform distribution of arrival times. The Schr√∂dinger method begins by assigning a Poisson distribution with expected value Œªt to the number of observations in the interval [0, t], the number of observations in non-overlapping subintervals being independent (see Poisson process). The number N of observations is Poisson-distributed with expected value Œª. Then we rely on the fact that the conditional probability :P(A\\\\mid N=n) \\\\, does not depend on Œª (in the language of statisticians, N is a sufficient statistic for this parametrized family of probability distributions for the order statistics). We proceed as follows: :P_\\\\lambda(A)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty P(A\\\\mid N=n)P(N=n)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty P(A\\\\mid N=n){\\\\lambda^n e^{-\\\\lambda} \\\\over n!}, so that :e^{\\\\lambda}\\\\,P_\\\\lambda(A)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty P(A\\\\mid N=n){\\\\lambda^n \\\\over n!}. Now the lack of dependence of P(A  N = n) upon Œª entails that the last sum displayed above is a power series in Œª and P(A  N = n) is the value of its nth derivative at Œª = 0, i.e., :P(A\\\\mid N=n) = \\\\left[{d^n \\\\over d\\\\lambda^n}\\\\left(e^\\\\lambda\\\\, P_\\\\lambda(A)\\\\right)\\\\right]_{\\\\lambda=0}. For this method to be of any use in finding P(A  N =n), must be possible to find PŒª(A) more directly than P(A  N = n). What makes that possible is the independence of the numbers of arrivals in non-overlapping subintervals.

He has been nicknamed \\"The Man of a Thousand Voices\\". Early life Little was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the middle of three sons. His father, Lawrence Peniston Little, was a surgeon who served as a lieutenant commander in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II and then worked for the Department of Veterans‚Äô Affairs until his death in 1959. His mother, Elizabeth Maud (n√©e Wilson), was a housewife. A third-generation Canadian, he is descended from English stock on his father's side and Irish on his mother's. On his mother's side, he is descended from John Willson, who was Speaker of the 5th Parliament of Upper Canada in the 1820s. Little's paternal great-grandfather, William Carruthers Little, was a Liberal-Conservative Member of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons from 1867 to 1881. He attended Lisgar Collegiate Institute. In his early teens, he formed a partnership with Geoff Scott, another budding impressionist (and future elected politician), concentrating on reproducing the voices of Canadian politicians such as Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton. Career =Early career in Ottawa= Starting when he was eleven, Little acted in two documentary movies for Crawley Films of Ottawa. Little was an usher at the Elgin Movie Theatre in Ottawa, where he would perfect his voices while standing at the back of the theatre. He started his amateur acting career at the Ottawa Little Theatre, winning his first acting award at the Eastern Ontario Drama Festival in Deep River, Ontario. At 17, he and friend and fellow impressionist Geoff Scott won a talent contest on 'on CBOT in Ottawa, the first time he was paid for his impressionist skills, which led to an appearance on Pick the Stars, a national talent contest broadcast by CBC Television in 1956. They then appeared on The Jackie Rae Show during the 1956-57 season.https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jackie-rae-emc Little and Scott's comedy team that performed at various local events and venues. Still in his teens, they developed a 10-minute act which they performed at Shriners‚Äô conventions and Knights of Columbus meetings. Scott later entered journalism, and ultimately politics. Little became a relief announcer on Ottawa radio station CFRA, before behind hired as a disk jockey on CJET in Smiths Falls, Ontario. His afternoon-evening shift ran from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and the show gave him the opportunity to use his impressions on the air. By the 1960s, Little was taking his act to Toronto where he performed at coffee houses and other venues. In 1963, Little issued two LPs through the Canadian division of Capitol Records; the first, My Fellow Canadians which he performed with Les Lye and which concentrated on Canadian political satire and featured Little and two other actors impersonating figures well-known to a Canadian audience such as Diefenbaker, Lester Pearson and Tommy Douglas. The second album, Scrooge and the Stars, featured Little acting out Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol entirely on his own, playing all the roles as 22 different Hollywood stars, ranging from Jack Benny to Jack Webb. The album was released in early November but it had to be withdrawn a few weeks later due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy as Little had imitated JFK in the role of the Spirit of Christmas Present and had Kennedy say the line ‚ÄúScrooge, my life upon the globe is brief; it ends tonight. In fact, it ends as fast as you can say your name.‚Äù =Breaking into the US= Little's first performance in the US was in December 1963 at Guy Lombardo‚Äôs inn and country dub in Tierra Verde, Florida. Little's American career was helped by Peppiatt and Aylesworth, a Canadian writing team who had moved to Hollywood and worked on various specials and variety series, including the Judy Garland Show. Familiar with Little's work in Canada, Peppiat had worked on The Jackie Rae Show on which Little made a television appearance at 17, and the team had written for Little's Canadian nightclib act. They played a recording of Little for Garland and they and the show's musical director, Mel Torm√© encouraged her to audition him. Torm√© had met Little when they both performed in a CBC Television variety show in Toronto and bonded over their love of old movies. The audition won him the job, and in January 1964 Little made his American television debut on CBS's The Judy Garland Show, where he impressed Garland by imitating various male celebrities, including James Mason who had been Garland's co-star in A Star Is Born.Rich Little on Judy Garland Show, 1964, 8 min. Television appearances on variety shows hosted by Ed Sullivan, Jackie Gleason, Rudy Vallee, Mike Douglas, George Burns, and Al Hirt followed over the next two years. Peppiatt and Aylesworth also helped bring Little on to other American shows they wrote for such as The Jimmy Dean Show, The Kopykats and The Julie Andrews Hour and continued to write matetial for his act when after he moved to the US permanently at the end of 1965. In Canada, Little starred in his own show The Rich Little Show, on CBC Radio in 1966. He also made his first appearances on The Dean Martin Show and The Jimmy Dean Show during the 1965-1966 season. In 1965, Little provided the voice for the Pink Panther in two experimental cartoons, Sink Pink and Pink Ice. In 1966 and 1967, Little appeared in ABC-TV's Judy Carne sitcom Love on a Rooftop as the Willises' eccentric neighbour, Stan Parker. He appeared on That Girl in 1967 as a writer who impressed Marlo Thomas' character with his impersonations. He also made two memorable appearances as accident-prone Brother Paul Leonardi on The Flying Nun in 1968; it marked one of his few appearances as a character actor rather than an impressionist. In 1969 he appeared in an episode of Petticoat Junction as newly engaged fiance to Billie Jo in \\"Billie Jo and the Big Big Star\\". Hawaii Five-O, 1976 =Nixon= One of his best-known impressions is of U.S. President Richard Nixon (reprising in 1991 the role of Nixon as ideal sperm donor in Gina's fantasies on the soap opera Santa Barbara). During the 1970s, Little made many television appearances portraying Nixon and once performed his impersonation in front of Nixon himself, who Little says did not realize he was imitating him at all and \\"wondered why I was talking to him in such a funny voice.\\" In 2020, he developed a one-man show around the late president, titled \\"Trial on the Potomac- The Impeachment of Richard Nixon\\". based on the book The Real Watergate Scandal, Collusion, Conspiracy, and the Plot That Brought Nixon Down by Geoff Shepard, which alleged a conspiracy to remove Nixon from office. =1970s= Little was also a semi-regular on the Emmy-winning ABC-TV variety series The Julie Andrews Hour in 1972‚Äì73. In response to his imitation of Jack Benny, the comedian sent Little an 18-carat gold money clip containing this message: \\"With Bob Hope doing my walk and you doing my voice, I can be a star and do nothing.\\" He was named \\"Comedy Star of the Year\\" by the American Guild of Variety Artists in 1974. Little's best- known continuing TV series was The Kopycats, hour-long segments of The ABC Comedy Hour, broadcast in 1972. Taped in England, these comedy-variety shows consisted entirely of celebrity impersonations, with the actors in full costume and makeup for every sketch. The cast included Little, Frank Gorshin, Marilyn Michaels, George Kirby, British comedian Joe Baker, Fred Travalena, Charlie Callas and Peter Goodwright. Little was a regular guest on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in the 1970s, appearing in 24 of the specials, where he roasted celebrities such as Don Rickles, Jack Benny, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart and Kirk Douglas. The Rich Little Show (1976) on NBC and The New You Asked for It (1981) were attempts to present Little in his own person, away from his gallery of characterizations. Little also appeared on a second season episode of The Muppet Show. Little has starred in various HBO specials including the 1978 one-man show, Rich Little's Christmas Carol, which was produced by and originally aired on CBC Television, in which Little portrayed famous comedians in established roles (W. C. Fields as Ebenezer Scrooge, Paul Lynde as Bob Cratchit, et al). He followed this up with another HBO special in 1983, Rich Little's Robin Hood, in which he portrayed Groucho Marx as Robin Hood, Humphrey Bogart as Prince John, John Wayne as Little John, Carol Channing as Maid Marion, Laurel & Hardy as Sheriffs of Nottingham, George Burns as Alan-a-Dale, and various other characters. In 1981 Little appeared in a comedy LP called The First Family Rides Again, which was the fourth and final of the First Family comedy LPs originally created by Bob Booker and Earle Doud. Little starred along with Melanie Chartoff, Michael Richards, Shelly Black, Jenilee Harrison, Earle Doud, and Vaughn Meader, making light of U.S. President Ronald Reagan's first few months in the White House. In all, Little has released nine albums and three HBO specials.https://www.greeleytribune.com/2020/02/28/master-impersonator-rich- little-to-perform-at-uccc/ =1980s= Outside of any comedic context, Little's talent for impersonation has been used in movies when an actor's dialogue was impaired by poor health. When David Niven proved too ill for his voice to be used in his appearances in Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) and Curse of the Pink Panther (1983), Little provided the overdub as an imitation of Niven's voice. He performed similar duties to dub an imitation of James Cagney's stroke-impaired voice in the 1984 TV movie Terrible Joe Moran and in the 1991 TV special Christmas at the Movies by providing an uncredited dub for actor/dancer Gene Kelly who had lost his voice. He also lent his voice to the narration of three specials which were the forerunners for the animated series The Raccoons: The Christmas Raccoons, The Raccoons on Ice and The Raccoons and the Lost Star., and In 1987, during the We the People 200: The Constitutional Gala television special, Little personified various historical figures including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Edward R. Murrow, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Little's performance was described as eclectic, impersonating Henry Fonda as Abraham Lincoln and doing Winston Churchill giving a rousing speech.Levin, Daniel. Representing Popular Sovereignty: The Constitution in American Political Culture, State Univ. of New York Press (1999) p. 94\\"Rich Little impersonates historical figures, 1987, 6 min. =The Tonight Show= Little was a frequent guest on variety and talk shows in the 1960s and 1970s and had an unofficial monthly slot on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson for several years, and also guest hosted the program about a dozen times. He developed an impression of Johnny Carson, capturing The Tonight Show host's voice and many onstage mannerisms and later played Carson in the HBO TV-movie The Late Shift. Little's spot-on impersonation allegedly got under the thin skin of Carson and he was permanently banned from appearing on the Tonight Show without notice or reason after his August 1982 appearance. Little claims in his biography that he was banned because Carson was offended by his impression and this claim was supported by Henry Bushkin, Carson's long-time lawyer, who stated that nobody got under Carson's skin more than Little. However, Little had been doing the impression since the early 1970s, a decade prior to his bookings on the show coming to an end, including performing the impression to the Tonight Show's host face when Carson was the guest of honor at The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast of Johnny Carson in 1973.https://bestclassicbands.com/rich-little- johnny-carson-3-6-19/ In response to Little's claims, Fred DeCordova, Carson's producer, said they just weren't interested in hiring him any more due to his lack of new impressions. =Vegas and later career= Little has been appearing in Las Vegas since the mid-1960s when he had dates at the Golden Nugget and would go on to play at other Vegas venues such as The Sands, where he debuted in 1969 with a two-year contract. In 1973, he performed at Caesars Palace for four weeks in 1973 as the opening act for The Osmonds. He then appeared at the Desert Inn with Juliet Prowse for a month in 1974. His appearances continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s; he headlined at the Desert Inn for eight years in the late 1970s and 1980s, at the MGM Grand with Nell Carter in 1985; at Bally‚Äôs, with Charo in 1986; the Sands in 1991 and 1992 as well as at the Golden Nugget in 1991. With opportunities for him to work in television and film in decline, and his television work almost completely drying up by the mid-1980s, the focus of Little's career shifted from Hollywood to Las Vegas. The decline in his career was blamed in part on him not having updated his repertory of impressions with younger voices, a fact he blames on recent generations of actors using a naturalistic delivery that makes their voices less distinctive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much easier to do Humphrey Bogart than Tom Cruise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow do you imitate Brad Pitt? George Clooney? Wouldn‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù Little relocated to Vegas in 1990, and sold his house in Los Angeles and bought a home in Vegas in 1992, when he signed an exclusive long-term contract with the Sahara, staging a revamped version of \\"The Kopykats\\" with other impersonators. He later moved to Paris Las Vegas, where he starred in The Presidents, a play on nine Presidents of the United States from Kennedy to George W. Bush starting in 2002. In 2004, he moved to The Suncoast. In the early 2010s, he performed a one-man show, Jimmy Stewart & Friends, based on the life of Jimmy Stewart, at the LVH hotel, and on tour. After the death of his friend Jimmy Stewart in the late 1990s, Rich recorded the crosswalk messages for intersections in Stewart's home town of Indiana, Pennsylvania using his imitation of the star's voice. Since 2015, Little has a regular performer at the Laugh Factory in the Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas. His one-hour show, Rich Little Live!, is a career retrospective including video highlights from his TV career and is performed five nights a week. Throughout the show, he displays many of the charcoal sketches he has drawn of the celebrities he has impersonated.https://www.overtoncountynews.com/arts_and_entertainment/rich- little-still-impresses/article_6a093a4c-a27d-11e9-a76a-732f0ed5617b.html Little was the host for the 2007 White House Correspondents' Association dinner. Although President George W. Bush was reported to have enjoyed Little's performance, it was panned by some reviewers for \\"his ancient jokes and impressions of dead people (Johnny Carson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan).\\" Little voices as a guest star in Futurama such as Futurama: Bender's Game, playing his own celebrity head: \\"This is Rich Little, impersonating Howard Cosell.\\" Many times he plays a sports commentator. In 1998, Little was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. Little was inducted into the Casino Legends Hall of Fame in 1999 and given a star on the Las Vegas Walk of Stars in 2005. In 2017, Little released his memoir, Little By Little: People I Have Known And Been. Other interests Little has been active in several charities including the Juvenile Diabetes Fund and the Children's Miracle Network. He has been named to Miami Children's Hospital International Pediatrics Hall of Fame and been honoured by the naming of the Rich Little Special Care Nursery at Ottawa Civic Hospital. He has been a major supporter in helping veterans through the Gary Sinise Foundation. Personal life Little was engaged to Canadian actress Jean Christopher in 1965 but they did not end up marrying. Little was married to Jeanne Worden, whom he met when she was working as a secretary on The Joey Bishop Show, from 1971; the couple had a daughter together, Bria, before their divorce in 1989. Little had a brief relationship with Lalette Cottrell, of Delaware; the couple had a daughter together, Lyndsay (born 1988). Little was engaged to magician Melinda Saxe, but she broke off the three-year relationship in 1991, saying she had discovered that he had secretly videotaped them having sex in 1988. Saxe sued Little for defamation, invasion of privacy, and inflicting emotional distress, claiming he had secretly videotaped their sexual encounters in 1988 and had joked about their relationship on stage. Little claimed the videotaping was consensual. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court. He married comedian and impressionist Jeannette Markey in 1994; they divorced in 1997. He was married to Marie Marotta from 2003 until her death in 2010 of a deliberate overdose of sleeping pills after years of suffering from migraines and chronic pain. He married his fourth wife, Catherine Brown, a former reality show contestant, in a private ceremony in 2012; they divorced in October later that year. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. In 2010, Little became a naturalized American citizen.

He was born in Lancaster, Ohio, one of six children of an electrician father. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in correspondence school and became a certified electrical engineer. He worked for Columbia Gas and held patents related to the pumping of gas. Miller was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966 to represent a section of southeastern Ohio where, in Lancaster, he had served as mayor. During the Persian Gulf War, he was reportedly the only member of Congress who had a grandson (Drew Miller, of Lancaster, Ohio) fighting in that conflict. By training, he was an engineer, and The Almanac of American Politics wrote that Mr. Miller approached politics with the \\"precise and orderly manner\\" that one might expect from someone of his profession. US Patents , Filed August 1, 1960, Patented May 7, 1963 \\"Remote Control and Alarm System For A Compressor Station and Compressor Engines Thereof\\" , Filed July 26, 1960, Patented October 5, 1965 \\"Magneto Having Auxiliary Pole Piece\\" Elections In 1966, the Tenth Congressional District elected Miller to the Ninetieth Congress, defeating incumbent Democrat Walter H. Moeller, and he was re-elected to twelve succeeding Congresses. Miller was a 13-term Ohio Republican nicknamed \\"Five Percent Clarence\\" for his persistent efforts to cut spending bills by that amount. He did not cultivate publicity, preferring instead to focus on legislation more than on the Washington talk-show circuit. He was known for his near-perfect attendance on votes no matter how minute. In 1990, the Capitol Hill publication Roll Call named Mr. Miller the \\"most obscure\\" member of Congress. It was intended as a compliment, considering that grandstanders never would have received such an honor. A fiscal conservative, he served on the House Appropriations Committee. The numerous bills he introduced, often unsuccessfully, aimed to cut spending measures‚Äîif not by the 5 percent figure in his nickname, then at least by 2 percent. In 1977, he succeeded in persuading House colleagues to cut foreign aid by 5 percent. He lost his bid for reelection in the 1992 primary after redistricting.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/clarence-e- miller-ohio-congressman-dies-at-93/2011/08/02/gIQAwQ8bqI_story.html Elections by landslide In his younger years. Twelve of the thirteen elections won by Mr. Miller were by a margin of victory of greater than 25%. Heated 1992 primary Ohio lost two seats in the 1990 reapportionment. The Democrats and Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly struck a deal to eliminate one Democratic and one Republican district, as one congressman from each party was expected to retire. The Republican expected to retire was Miller, but he announced he would run again. The Democrats in the Statehouse would not reconsider the deal and so Miller's Tenth District was obliterated. (The new Tenth was in Cuyahoga County.) The new district map was not agreed upon by the General Assembly until March 26, 1992, one week before the filing deadline for the primary originally scheduled for May 5. (Governor George Voinovich signed the new map into law on March 27, and on April 1 the General Assembly moved the primary to June 2.) Miller's own hometown was placed in freshman David Hobson's Seventh District, but Miller chose to run in the Sixth District against Bob McEwen; only one of the twelve counties in Miller's old Tenth District was in the new Seventh but the largest piece of his old district, five counties, was placed in the new Sixth. Miller also had a strong distaste for McEwen, a Hillsboro Republican in his sixth term who had been elected to Congress at age thirty. Despite being hurt in a fall in his bathtub after slipping on a bar of soap, an injury that led Republicans to expect his withdrawal, Miller stayed in the race. A deal was hoped for as late as May 15, the day Miller was scheduled to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal, but Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced each other in the Republican primary on June 2, 1992. McEwen, who Congressional Quarterly's Politics in America pronounced \\"invincible\\", was caught up in the House banking scandal, which had been seized upon by Newt Gingrich, a like-minded conservative House Republican, as an example of the corruption of Congress. Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News said \\"McEwen was collateral damage\\" to Gingrich's crusade. McEwen initially denied bouncing any checks. Later, he admitted he had bounced a few. Then when the full totals were released by Ethics Committee investigators, the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty-nine months. McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts, pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms, who ran the House bank, paying checks on an overdrawn account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative's next paycheck. In 1991, McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the franking privilege and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense, but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on the Intelligence Committee and in building relationships with legislatures overseas. The primary race was bitter. Miller called McEwen \\"Pinocchio\\" and McEwen said of Miller \\"his misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I tried to be his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply disappointed at the meanness of his effort.\\" Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: \\"both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs ‚Äî unless located in their districts.\\" Miller noted he had no overdrafts, saying, \\"the score is 166 to nothing\\" referring to the number of checks McEwen bounced in the House banking scandal. The 1992 primary was so close it forced a recount and a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller's charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking, and Warren Counties, Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court. Only in August did Miller drop his court challenge and then only because his campaign was out of money. In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller's 32,922, a plurality of only 297 votes. Ominously for November, each had won the counties they had formerly represented, McEwen making little headway in the new eastern counties in the district. After the final result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen and carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis. After the primary, McEwen introduced H. R. 5727 in the House to name the locks on the Ohio near Gallipolis after Miller, but the bill did not pass. McEwen subsequently lost the general election that year to Ted Strickland. Family His wife of 51 years, the former Helen Brown, died in 1987. The couple had two children, Ronald K. Miller of Lancaster and Jacqueline M. Williams of Cincinnati; five grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Death After his election loss Clarence Miller returned to Lancaster. He was honored on his birthday, November 20, 2010, by the Hocking Valley Chapter of the Ohio Society of The Sons of the American Revolution, for his patriotism. He resided in Lancaster until his death on August 2, 2011, aged 93.

Typical forms of information subsidies include press releases, as well as press seminars and conferences. This information represents a subsidy to the media, since it lowers the cost of news-gathering. Out of the various alternatives available to the media to collect information ‚Äîinvestigative work, informal channels and routine sources‚Äî, the latter channel is the cheapest to monitor and maintain. Relying on information provided by external sources can thus relieve the economic burden and shorten the time to publication, especially when the information is presented in a format (such as an inverted pyramid) and style that can be easily incorporated in news. On the other hand, critics argue that subsidies have the potential to skew the process of news selection by leading journalists to pick stories based on criteria other than their inherent importance and newsworthiness. The content of the coverage, critics contend, is also likely to be influenced, since the subsidised materials are usually biased in favour of the source organisation. From the source's point of view, the ideal goal is to have the news media view reflect as closely as possible their own.

He played for the Boston Red Sox between 1906 and 1916, and he was a player-manager for the last four of those seasons. In 1915 and 1916, Carrigan's teams won back-to-back World Series. He was said to exert a positive influence on young Red Sox star Babe Ruth, serving as his roommate and his manager. After his playing career, Carrigan was a partner in a large chain of New England vaudeville and movie theaters. He returned to the Red Sox as a manager between 1927 and 1929; the team finished in last place in each of those seasons. He then returned to his native Lewiston, where he was named a bank president in 1953 and where he died in 1969. Early life Carrigan was born in Lewiston, Maine.\\"Sketches of 13 Who Played Here in '12.\\" Boston Record American, April 21, 1962, p. 11. Carrigan's brother John was a talented pitcher, and Carrigan served as his catcher. Carrigan played football and baseball at Lewiston High School; he also played roller polo, but it caused him to get into fights, and his brother pleaded with him to stop playing. He studied at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.Sawyer, Ford. \\"'Retired Lewiston banker is lured back to Boston by love of baseball.\\" Boston Globe, December 5, 1926, p. C11. At the time, Holy Cross was known for sending its baseball players to the major leagues. Early baseball career L to R: Cy Young, Jake Stahl, Carrigan and Michael T. McGreevy during spring training in 1912 Carrigan started his career as a platoon catcher and played all ten seasons with the Boston Red Sox. Biographer Richard A. Johnson noted that Carrigan was known in baseball for combining toughness with intelligence. For a portion of his time in Boston, Carrigan's roommate was Babe Ruth. \\"Carrigan served Ruth as a combination father confessor, drill sergeant, psychologist and Dutch uncle,\\" wrote Johnson. Ruth called Carrigan the best manager he ever played for. Carrigan also had a close relationship with Detroit Tigers star Ty Cobb. Both Carrigan and Cobb were known for their intense play on the field, but they were friends and Cobb often came to Maine to visit Carrigan. A schism was forming along religious lines among Red Sox players and coaches in the early 1910s. Players like Tris Speaker held anti-Catholic sentiments, and they supported their manager, Stahl. Carrigan was among a group of Catholics on the team who were more aligned with team co-owner Jimmy McAleer. Midway through the 1913 season, McAleer fired Stahl and made Carrigan a player-manager. Author Thomas Whalen writes that Speaker and Carrigan once had a fistfight, and Carrigan won the fight, helping him to establish a sense of authority. The Red Sox finished in second place in 1914. In July of that year, they paid $25,000 to Baltimore of the International League for Babe Ruth, Ernie Shore and Ben Egan. Ruth gave up 21 hits in 23 innings pitched for the Red Sox that year. Hubert \\"Dutch\\" Leonard and Bill Carrigan (right), 1916 Carrigan received a dispensation from the Catholic Church to marry a Protestant woman, Beulah Bartlett, before the 1915 baseball season. They had been friends since childhood. Carrigan led the team to world championships in 1915 and 1916, compiling an 8‚Äì2 record as a manager in World Series play. Until Terry Francona duplicated the feat in 2007, he was the only manager to have won two World Series titles with Boston. In August 1916, Carrigan approached Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin about the possibility of retiring soon. His father-in-law's death had left some family business outstanding. The next month he decided that he would step down at the end of the season, wanting to decrease the time he spent traveling. He was also looking to devote more attention to a movie theater partnership known as the Maine and New Hampshire Theater Corporation. Lannin had hoped that Carrigan would change his mind, but other things were on Carrigan's mind. He and his wife had a child, also named Beulah, in November, and they later had another daughter, Constance, and a son, William Jr. Hiatus from baseball With Carrigan having turned down Lannin's pleas to remain manager of the Red Sox, and with Lannin having sold the team, new owner Harry Frazee named Jack Barry as Carrigan's successor in January 1917. Carrigan pursued his theater venture. The group owned as many as fifty theaters and there were three other partners in the corporation: a Lewiston man named William P. Gray; a former Mayor of Portsmouth, Albert Hyslop; and former New Hampshire Governor John H. Bartlett. In January 1922, Carrigan sold his interests in the corporation to Gray; the Washington Times said that Carrigan was thought to have received between $200,000 and $250,000. Return to the Red Sox In the years after Carrigan's unexpected departure from the Red Sox, he was often the subject of rumors about a return to baseball. In the article announcing the sale of his theater shares, the Washington Times even speculated that he might be preparing to buy the Red Sox from Frazee. Carrigan did return to the Red Sox, but it was as a manager and not until 1927. He was unable to duplicate his previous success, as Boston finished in last place for three straight seasons. By early December 1929, Carrigan said he was uncertain whether he would accept President Bob Quinn's offer to return as Red Sox manager. Despite the team's struggles, James O'Leary of The Boston Globe wrote that \\"Pres Quinn and every baseball fan in New England and throughout the entire American League circuit would like to see the veteran back on the job next season.\\" Carrigan resigned on December 20. Carrigan at his summer home on Annabessacook Lake, Winthrop, Maine, July 1965 Later life In 1953, Carrigan was named president of People's Savings Bank in Lewiston. In 1958, Carrigan's wife died. Carrigan died at Central Maine General Hospital in Lewiston at the age of 85. He was posthumously elected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004.

It ran uninterrupted for almost 200 years, until 1922. It was the first to use the term magazine (from the French magazine, meaning \\"storehouse\\") for a periodical. Samuel Johnson's first regular employment as a writer was with The Gentleman's Magazine. History The original complete title was The Gentleman's Magazine: or, Trader's monthly intelligencer. Cave's innovation was to create a monthly digest of news and commentary on any topic the educated public might be interested in, from commodity prices to Latin poetry. It carried original content from a stable of regular contributors, as well as extensive quotations and extracts from other periodicals and books. Cave, who edited The Gentleman's Magazine under the pen name \\"Sylvanus Urban\\", was the first to use the term magazine (meaning \\"storehouse\\") for a periodical. Contributions to the magazine frequently took the form of letters, addressed to \\"Mr. Urban\\". The iconic illustration of St. John's Gate on the front of each issue (occasionally updated over the years) depicted Cave's home, in effect, the magazine's \\"office\\". Before the founding of The Gentleman's Magazine, there were specialized journals, but no such wide-ranging publications (although there had been attempts, such as The Gentleman's Journal, which was edited by Peter Motteux and ran from 1692 to 1694). Samuel Johnson's first regular employment as a writer was with The Gentleman's Magazine. During a time when parliamentary reporting was banned, Johnson regularly contributed parliamentary reports as \\"Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia\\". Though they reflected the positions of the participants, the words of the debates were mostly Johnson's own. The name \\"Columbia\\", a poetic name for America coined by Johnson, first appears in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament in the magazine.The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285 Retrieved 2009-08-22Debates in Parliament, Samuel Johnson. Retrieved 2009-08-22 A skilled businessman, Edward Cave developed an extensive distribution system for The Gentleman's Magazine. It was read throughout the English-speaking world and continued to flourish through the 18th century and much of the 19th century under a series of different editors and publishers. It went into decline towards the end of the 19th century and finally ceased general publication in September 1907. However, issues consisting of four pages each were printed in very small editions between late 1907 and 1922 in order to keep the title formally \\"in print\\".

At the 1998 Origins International Game Expo and Fair in Columbus, Ohio, Looney launched its Aquarius card game. Proton and Q-Turn were design in 1998‚Äì1999. Alison Frane started working at Looney Labs with Fluxx using her artistic abilities. The company's November 1999 weekly web zine officially launched its Mad Lab Rabbit fan demo program. Iron Crown went into bankruptcy thus the Looney triggered the license provision allowing the rights to revert to the company. Lab then decided to publish Fluxx in house instead of finding another publisher. Kristin Looney by 2000 quit her job to work full-time. By 2000, the company re-released Icehouse as Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set, released Chrononauts and a new printing of Fluxx (version 2.1). Icehouse sold poorly in stores while selling briskly on the company's website. In summer 2001, ACMS, later renamed Print Mail Communications (PMC), took over from the storage unit as warehousing and distribution company. In 2001, IceHouse and Chrononauts both won Origins Awards 2000 while Looney Labs published Cosmic Coasters, Fluxx Blanxx, and Chrononauts: Lost Identities. Icehouse pieces were released as monochrome stash tubes in 2001. Andrew Looney became full-time by 2002. Labs released in 2002 Nanofictionary, Are You a Werewolf? and a new Fluxx primary version. In 2003, the company expanded the Fluxx line with its first themed variant and a licensed German language version. Looney Labs found in 2004 that an unaware Covenant Communications had published a rip-off of their game, Aquarius, as Search, Ponder, and Play! in 2003, for which Labs reached a licensing deal with Covenant. In 2004, the Zendo icehouse set won Best Abstract Board Game of 2003. while in 2005 the set won the Mensa Select Game Award. =Apartment based= Company offices moved to Janet's Attic, an attic apartment in their friends' house several blocks away in early 2005. By October 2005, EcoFluxx was in play testing while Just Desserts was in prototype, or beta stage. Robin Vinopal joined the company in early 2006 becoming Chief Operating Officer, Treasurer, and member of the Board of Directors. In 2006, Lab revamped their Icehouse sets to the Treehouse main set plus two color schemes and also released Martian Coasters. With the 2007 publishing of Zombie Fluxx the first new type of card, Creeper, is introduced. Also in 2007, the Mad Rabbits fan/demo program was shut down. With Frane's purchase of a house, Pepperland, in 2008, the company moved into its basement apartment. Product wise that year, Labs released edition 4 Fluxx and worked with Toy Vault to release Monty Python Fluxx. The company began using a standard two-part box instead of to- fit tuck box for a consistent look and shelving ease. In , Looney Labs published one new card game, Are You the Traitor?, another Fluxx variant, new editions of its two other card games and a few expansion sets while starting to use a postcard promo card for marketing. The company on started distributing through Publisher Services, Inc. for international accounts, and to the book trade. On , Labs launched its Full Baked Ideas imprint with a new edition of Stoner Fluxx and expectations for a drinking variant of Fluxx. The Back to the Future: The Card Game was released in 2010 along with two Fluxx re-releases in the new box format. Two new Fluxx variants debuted in 2011 that saw the IceHouse pyramids re-released with a new lead game set, IceDice. The company's fan/demo club was restarted in 2011. The company on reduced the number of distribution companies that they ship through to ACD Distribution and Alliance Game Distributors for the US hobby game market, Lion Rampant for Canada and Publisher Services, Inc. for U.S. mass market and book trade and the international market. ACD and Alliance would also make their supporting material available via subscription. On August 1, 2012, Looney Labs got a simplified less expensive general market version with redesigned packaging of Fluxx into Target stores. On February 7, 2013, Labs released the 2.0 edition of Nanofictionary as a print on demand product. =Office based= In August 2013, the company moved from Pepperland basement to the top floor of The Sterling Building, an actual office complex. In May 2015, Labs changed its fulfillment company from PMC to Excel. Lab added in mid-2015 GTS as another distributor. Loonacy was released in March 2014 and won the Parents' Choice FunStuff Award Spring 2014 Games. While two other Loonacy versions were released in the next two following years. In 2017, Looney Labs had multiple releases with three Fully Baked Ideas summer releases of variants of existing games, a revived Nanofictionary version, a few variants of Fluxx including Chemistry Fluxx and Zendo. In December 2017, the company reissued Zendo game separate from the Looney pyramids line for the first time. Graphic artist Mary Engelbreit was signed to a licensing deal in February 2018 with Looney Labs' for versions of Fluxx and Loonacy games to be released in the third quarter 2018. Two second quarter games were also schedule, a new Fluxx set and Get the MacGuffin card game.

The Uprising ended in capitulation, the deaths of over 250,000 civilians, and only 15% of Warsaw intact; with the benefit of hindsight, many people have argued that it should never have been started. Others have argued that it was inevitable and even crucial for Poland to prove its commitment to the Allied cause. Although Stalin was later to describe it as a \\"criminal enterprise,\\" just two days prior to its initiation, Radio Moscow had called for the Polish people to rise in arms. To understand the Uprising, then, it is crucial to understand the circumstances that led up to its initiation. Research in this area is difficult because the facts are not always fully available: there are still some sources of information, such as the British and Soviet archives, which remain closed (as of 2004). Therefore, analysis of the Uprising must also incorporate the speculation, past and present, concerning the time prior to the uprising.  Operation Tempest  From the very beginning of its existence the Home Army was planning a national uprising against the German forces. Initial plans created by the Polish government-in-exile in 1942 assumed that the allied invasion of Europe would lead to the withdrawal of considerable German forces from the Eastern Front for the defence of the Third Reich. The Home Army would act to prevent troop transfer to the west and to allow the British and American forces to seize Germany by breaking all communication links with the majority of German forces massed in the Soviet Union. However, by 1943 it became apparent that the allied invasion of Europe would not come in time, and that in all probability the Red Army would reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the invasion had well begun. In February, 1943, general Stefan Rowecki amended the plan. The Uprising was to be started in three phases, the first being in the East (with main centres of resistance in Lw√≥w and Wilno), before the advancing Red Army. The second part was to include armed struggle in the belt between the Curzon Line and the Vistula river, while the third part was to be a nationwide uprising in all of Poland. Polish- Soviet relations were broken off on April 25, 1943 due to the Katyn massacre, and it became obvious that the advancing Red Army might not come to Poland as a liberator but rather, as General Rowecki put it, \\"Our Allies' Ally\\". On November 26, 1943 the Polish government in exile issued an instruction to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before their entry to Poland, the Home Army forces were to remain underground until further decisions were made. However, the Home Army commander took a different approach, and on November 30, 1943 the final version of the plan was created. It became known as Operation Tempest.  Diplomacy with the Soviets and other Allies  The Warsaw Uprising, or at least some form of insurrection in Poland, had been planned long in advance. Warsaw was chosen, partially, because of its status as a pre-war capital. The allies foresaw that the Germans would wish to hold onto Warsaw for as long as possible, as a tool of morale, communications and supply and troop movement, The Polish government- in-exile strongly wanted support from the other allies. For this reason they carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from their allies prior to the start of battle. Although there were supply drops by American, British and Polish forces prior to, and during the Uprising most fell uselessly into German hands. This left the Polish Home Army forces seriously under supplied.  The Soviet advance  The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of the influence of Polish Government in Exile and as a direct operation against German occupiers. The fear was that in the aftermath of the war the allies would ignore the legal London-based government. It was clear that Poland would be liberated by the Red Army, and that the Soviet Union did not recognise the Government-in-Exile. Initially, after the Red Army forces crossed the pre-war Polish borders, the local Home Army units were engaged in successful cooperation with the Soviets in liberating several towns and cities. However, in most cases after the struggle ended the Polish officers and members of local administration were caught by the NKVD and either shot or sent to Gulags and prisons in Russia. At the same time most of the Polish soldiers caught by the Soviets were given the choice of either joining the Soviet-backed Polish People's Army or sharing the fate of their officers. Nevertheless, the Soviet advance was fast, and the Polish authorities saw no other choice but to continue the struggle against the German forces and aid the Soviets. At the same time the government in London asked the SOE and the Foreign Office several times for an allied mission to Poland to be sent; such missions had already been dispatched to all resistance movements in Europe, including Albania, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Yugoslavia. However, the pleas were not fulfilled until December 1944. The official line of Soviet propaganda was that the Polish underground was \\"waiting with their arms at ease\\" and was not fighting the common enemy. As the Soviet forces were nearing Warsaw in June and July 1944, the Soviet radio stations demanded a full national uprising in Warsaw to cut the communication lines of the German units still on the right bank of the Vistula. On July 29, 1944 the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw. With the recent flood of reports from the eastern territories about forced demilitarisation, trials and execution of Home Army soldiers by the Soviets, on 21 July 1944 the High Command of the Home Army decided to expand the scope of the Operation Tempest to include Warsaw itself. The date for the Warsaw Uprising was set to 1 August.  German defensive preparations  By the end of July the town had been declared \\"Festung Warschau\\" (Fortress Warsaw) by the Germans. It was to be defended at all cost against the Soviet offensive. However, the July 20 Plot and the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler made many German units withdraw westward through Warsaw. The Home Army saw it as a sign of defeat of the Germans. The number of German soldiers in the area was lowered significantly. On July 27, the governor of the General Government, Hans Frank called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17‚Äì65 to arrive at several assembly points in Warsaw the following day. They were to be employed at construction of fortifications for the Wehrmacht in and around the city. This move was viewed by the Home Army as an attempt to neutralise the underground forces and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it. Fearing German reprisal actions, general Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski ordered full mobilisation of Home Army forces in Warsaw area.

It was historically in the parish of St Dogwells.  Geography and transport links  Wolfscastle comprises two small villages; Wolfscastle proper, at the top of a hill, and Ford, situated in the river valley below. The remains of a motte and bailey castle lie in the upper village, a strategic location determined by its situation at the northern end of Treffgarne gorge. The village lies at the confluence of the Western Cleddau and the Anghof rivers, in the parish of St Dogwell's. Wolf's Castle motte The A40 road, the London to Fishguard trunk route, passes through Wolfscastle and provides the main transport route to and from the village, with a regular bus service connecting with the major towns of the area. The main railway line from Swansea to Fishguard Harbour passes through Ford. At one time, there was a station named at the point where the A40 road crosses the railway for both passengers and the loading of milk from local farms, but this was closed in 1964 when the local train service between Fishguard and Clarbeston Road was withdrawn. At the present time (2018) the line carries two daily services each way between Swansea and Fishguard Harbour, timed to connect at Swansea with services from London Paddington and at Fishguard with the Irish ferry service to Rosslare, plus a limited number of local services between Fishguard, Clarbeston Road and Haverfordwest. The latter were reintroduced in 2012, almost fifty years after being withdrawn, but the station at Wolf's Castle was not reopened as part of this initiative.  History  Musland Farm was once the residence of Captain William Davies Evans, the first utiliser of the Evans Gambit in chess. The castle formed part of the series of defences constructed by the Normans after 1093 known as the Landsker Line, providing a general boundary between the English-speaking south and the Welsh-speaking north. A Romano-British villa was excavated by the antiquarian Richard Fenton, hinting that Roman influence extended further west than had previously been thought. It has been subjected to a recent investigation to ascertain its exact location. The railway from Clarbeston Road station to Letterston Junction, 4¬æ miles along the line north of the village, opened in 1906, replacing the former North Pembrokeshire & Fishguard Railway route from Clynderwen to Fishguard via Maenclochog and Rosebush, which did not pass close to Wolf's Castle.  Folklore  Wolfscastle's claim to fame is that it is allegedly the place where the last wild wolf in Wales was slain. Nearby, east of Treffgarne gorge lies the hamlet of Little Treffgarne, where the Welsh national hero, Owain Glynd≈µr was born according to local folklore in 1353 (although most historical sources quote him as being born about 1359). This was mainly because the area was home to members of the family of Glynd≈µr's mother. Another legend of the area claims that a local medium, Sarah Bevan, prophesied the arrival of the railway after experiencing a vision in the 18th century. The vision was described as a line of carts moving through the centre of Treffgarne gorge at high speed, with the frontmost cart on fire, heralding the coming of the as yet uninvented steam locomotive on rails.  Economy  Mainly agricultural due to its rural location, the village does boast both the Wolfscastle Country Hotel and a public house, the Wolfe Inn. Agriculture involves dairy, sheep and beef farming, and several farms can be found within the village and its environs. Previous economic assets included slate quarrying near Sealyham, roadstone quarrying in Treffgarne gorge and a village post office, all of which have ceased operating. Also, the running of the halt merited the employment of staff.  Community  A Welsh Independent chapel, known as Pen-y-Bont, stands near the river in Ford. Several churches are to be found in the area ‚Äì St Margaret's in Wolfscastle itself, St Michael's in Treffgarne, and St Dogfael's at St Dogwells (a grade II* listed building). A community council meets monthly in the village. Every summer the Wolfscastle Festival week is held and the community council sponsors the village's annual entry in the Wales in Bloom competition. In 2005 the village won the Small Village Trophy and was runner-up in 2006. A small, twin-classroom County Primary school, built in 1834, completes the community aspect of the village.

The theatre is operated in cooperation with Vereinigte B√ºhnen Wien (VBW) which also operates the Raimund Theater and the .  History  = Early history = , 1815 The theatre was the brainchild of the Viennese theatrical impresario Emanuel Schikaneder, who is best known as Mozart's librettist and collaborator on the opera The Magic Flute (1791). Schikaneder's troupe had already been successfully performing for several years in Vienna in the smaller and this is where The Magic Flute had premiered. As the troupe's performances often emphasized spectacle and scenery, the librettist felt ready to move to a larger and better equipped venue.Braunbehrens 1990, He had already been granted an imperial licence to build a new theatre in 1786, but it was only in 1798 that he felt ready to act on this authorization. The building was designed by the architect Franz J√§ger in Empire style (it has since been remodeled). Construction was completed in 1801. The theatre has been described as \\"the most lavishly equipped and one of the largest theatres of its age.\\".Peter Branscombe and David J. Buch, \\"Emanuel Schikaneder\\" in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians interior The theatre opened on 13 June 1801 with a prologue written by Schikaneder followed by a performance of the opera Alexander by Franz Teyber. The new theatre proved to be a sensation. Adolf B√§urle, a local critic, wrote \\"if Schikaneder and [his partner] Zitterbarth had had the idea ... to charge admission simply for looking at the glories of their , Schikaneder would certainly have been able to take in vast sums of money without giving one single performance.\\" The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung called it the \\"most comfortable and satisfactory in the whole of Germany\\" (which meant at the time, \\"all German-speaking lands\\").Honolka 1990, p. 187 In 1807 the theatre was acquired by a group of court nobles that included Count Ferdinand Palffy von Erd√∂d, who bought it outright in 1813. During the period of his proprietorship, which lasted until 1826, he offered opera and ballet and, to appeal to a wider Viennese audience, popular pantomime and variety acts, losing money in elaborate spectacles until finally he was forced to sell the theatre at auction in 1826. Only a part of the original building is preserved: the ' (Papageno Gate) is a memorial to Schikaneder, who is depicted playing the role of Papageno in The Magic Flute, a role he wrote for himself to perform. He is accompanied by the Three Boys, characters in the same opera. From 1889 to 1905, Alexandrine von Sch√∂nerer was managing director after the lease ended in 1884 between her and the librettist Camillo Walzel. In the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the theatre experienced a golden age during the flourishing of Viennese operetta, as referenced in the list below. = Later history = The during the period it emphasized Broadway musicals. The Broadway-style marquee was removed in 2005. From 1945 to 1955, it was one of the temporary homes of the Vienna State Opera, whose own building had been destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. However, in 1955, the theatre was closed for safety reasons. It languished unused for several years, and by the early 1960s, the threat had emerged that it would be converted to a parking garage. (This was the same era of \\"urban renewal\\" that in America nearly destroyed Carnegie Hall). By 1962 the theatre had a new and successful role as a venue for contemporary musical theatre. Many English-language musicals had their German premieres there. In 1992, the musical Elisabeth (about Franz Joseph I of Austria's wife, Elisabeth of Bavaria, also known as Sisi), premiered there and ran for six consecutive years until 1998; Elisabeth went on to become the most successful German- language musical to date, returning to the Theater an der Wien for a revival production from 2003 to 2005. The musical Cats directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne played successfully for seven years. Despite its focus on operettas and musicals, the theatre still served as a venue for occasional opera productions, especially during the Vienna Festival seasons, and sometimes co-produced with the Vienna State Opera. Notable productions of the non-standard repertory include: * Alban Berg's Lulu (1962), conducted by Karl B√∂hm, staged by Otto Schenk, designed by Caspar Neher, and starring Evelyn Lear * Joseph Haydn's Orfeo ed Euridice (1967), conducted by Richard Bonynge, staged by Rudolf Hartmann, and starring Nicolai Gedda and Joan Sutherland * Claudio Monteverdi's Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1971), conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and staged by Federik Mirdita * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's La clemenza di Tito (1976), conducted by Julius Rudel, staged by Mirdita, and starring Werner Hollweg, Teresa Berganza, Arleen Aug√©r, and Edda Moser * Franz Schubert's Fierrabras (1988), conducted by Claudio Abbado, staged by Ruth Berghaus, and starring Thomas Hampson, Karita Mattila, and L√°szl√≥ Polg√°r * The world premiere of Adriana H√∂lszky's Die W√§nde (1995), conducted by Ulf Schirmer, and staged by Hans Neuenfels Between 1996 and 2002, Riccardo Muti conducted new productions of the three da Ponte operas of Mozart, based on an original production by Giorgio Strehler. = Today = In 2006, the 250th anniversary year of Mozart's birth, the presented a series of major Mozart operas, thus initiating its conversion to a full-time venue for opera and other forms of classical music under the direction of .

It has a population of 923.General Register Office for Scotland : Census 2001 : Usual Resident Population : Lochcarron Civil Parish Retrieved 2009-11-18 Locality The name Lochcarron is also applied to the collection of small settlements strung out along Loch Carron, a sea loch on the west coast of Ross and Cromarty. The village stretches for almost , meandering along the shore of the loch. It means \\"Loch of rough water\\". In the 19th Century the village was named Janetown, then Jeantown. The local newspaper, An Carrannach, is published on a monthly basis. Lochcarron is a central location for hillwalking and touring the West Coast Highlands, including the Torridon, Plockton and Skye regions. Close to the village lies the Bealach na B√† road (Gaelic: Pass of the cattle), which links the town of Applecross to the rest of the mainland. It is a road popular with tourists, drivers, and motorcyclists alike for its scenery and hairpin bends. Amenities Lochcarron contains a variety of local services. These include two petrol stations, a Spar shop (which has a Post Office counter), a Highland Council service point (located at library), a nursing home (attached to which is the local library), medical centre and tartan weaving factory. There are also two hotels (offering entertainment and meals), a restaurant and two caf√©s. The community hall hosts a number of public events including ceilidhs and sales; and sports such as indoor bowls and short tennis. There are a number of self catering and bed and breakfast establishments, many of which are members of the local business association. Education The local primary school stands at the entrance to the village, with 43 pupils (as of December 2019). The primary school offers both English and Gaelic Medium education. Plockton High School is the nearest secondary school to Lochcarron. Employment The area's biggest employment sectors include tourism, crofting, and fish farming. Other employers include transportation via sea and road, and quarry work. Service industries include engineering, motor garages, health services and education. The Howard Doris Centre employs people in the care sector. Sport and recreation Sailing is a popular activity amongst the local and visiting population, and as such, a local RYA accredited, and Volvo Championship Club hosts free sailing sessions every Wednesday evening (between April and October), and racing sessions every Sunday afternoon. It currently enlists over 100 members. Lochcarron is home to the local shinty team Lochcarron Camanachd. The team currently play their home games at Battery Park in the west end of the village. The playing field is used during the week for training, and knockabout sessions. There is a 9-hole course in the area which is over 150 years old. The golf club's clubhouse offers catering facilities and golf clubs available to hire. The nearby Attadale hosts an annual Highland Games every third Saturday of July.

This agreement, between General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski and General Erich von dem Bach, which had taken a long period of on and off negotiations to achieve. Signing of the Capitulation Treaty On October 3 General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski signed the capitulation of the remaining Polish forces (Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej or Home Army Warsaw Corps) in the German headquarters in the presence of General von dem Bach. According to the capitulation treaty, the Home Army soldiers were to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the civilian population was to be treated humanely. The next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. Most of them were later sent to POW camps in various parts of Germany. At the same time the civilian population (approximately 700,000) was resettled to concentration camps west of Warsaw. Many soldiers, fearing German atrocities in captivity, chose to blend into the civilian population, escape Warsaw among them and continue the fight later. Reasons for Failure Warsaw Uprising Surrender October 5th 1944 There are several factors responsible for the failure, although there is no consensus about all of them nor their relative importance. One of the main reasons for the collapse of the uprising was the lack of support from the Soviet Red Army. Soviet assistance to the Home Army on the eastern territories was limited to small collaboration on a tactical level at best, with common incidents of shooting or imprisoning of Home Army soldiers after the area was seized by Soviets. During the Warsaw Uprising the Red Army stood on the other bank of the Vistula River and only elements from the Polish 1 Armia Wojska Polskiego attempted to make a crossing and received artillery support. The Soviet High Command did not allow pilots from the RAF and the Polish Air-forces to use Soviet landing strips. After the initial radio and leaflet propaganda campaign, the Moscow-backed Wanda radio station remained silent until the very end of fighting. It has been argued that the Soviets deliberately allowed the Germans to defeat the Home Army in order to eliminate a force in Poland which would oppose the communist puppet government the Soviets planned to install in Poland. This is consistent with later Soviet treatment of many Home Army soldiers, who were usually imprisoned, tortured and executed. ::See Operation Tempest for aftermath of other actions of that operation The decision to begin the Uprising can be viewed more as a political one (a demonstration to show the Soviets and the Western Allies that the Polish government-in-exile had control over the country) than a military one (since the military situation was worsening, as German troops in Warsaw were being strengthened and reinforced). The decision to start the Uprising was rushed several times: first on 20 July, when plans for Operation Tempest were changed to include Warsaw (after the series of reports on aggressive actions by Soviets toward Home Army units in the eastern territories), then on 31 July when exaggerated reports of approaching Russian forces convinced some decision makers that if they did not start the Uprising soon it would be too late to aid the Russians and 'make a stand'. Due to this rushed change of plans, personnel and ammunition available at the time of \\"W-hour\\" in Warsaw were not optimal. Fate of the Warsaw civilians Most civilians were not killed and many were released into the country west of Warsaw, but some were sent to concentration camps or subjected to slave labour. The entire civilian population of Warsaw was expelled from the city and sent to a transit camp Durchgangslager 121 in Pruszk√≥w. Out of 350,000‚Äì550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the Third Reich, 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps (including Ravensbr√ºck, Auschwitz, and Mauthausen, among others), while the rest were transported to various locations in the General Government and released. Fate of the Fighters Most fighters were sent to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Depending on where they were sent, they were later liberated by U.S., British or Soviet forces. This would have a big effect on their later lives.

Several definitions are in use, some of which are described below.  Informal definition  An informal definition is commonly used in physics textbooks and introductory lectures. It defines a supermanifold as a manifold with both bosonic and fermionic coordinates. Locally, it is composed of coordinate charts that make it look like a \\"flat\\", \\"Euclidean\\" superspace. These local coordinates are often denoted by :(x,\\\\theta,\\\\bar{\\\\theta}) where x is the (real-number-valued) spacetime coordinate, and \\\\theta\\\\, and \\\\bar{\\\\theta} are Grassmann-valued spatial \\"directions\\". The physical interpretation of the Grassmann-valued coordinates are the subject of debate; explicit experimental searches for supersymmetry have not yielded any positive results. However, the use of Grassmann variables allow for the tremendous simplification of a number of important mathematical results. This includes, among other things a compact definition of functional integrals, the proper treatment of ghosts in BRST quantization, the cancellation of infinities in quantum field theory, Witten's work on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and more recent applications to mirror symmetry. The use of Grassmann-valued coordinates has spawned the field of supermathematics, wherein large portions of geometry can be generalized to super-equivalents, including much of Riemannian geometry and most of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras (such as Lie superalgebras, etc.) However, issues remain, including the proper extension of deRham cohomology to supermanifolds.  Definition  Three different definitions of supermanifolds are in use. One definition is as a sheaf over a ringed space; this is sometimes called the \\"algebro-geometric approach\\".Alice Rogers, Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications, World Scientific, (2007) (See Chapter 1) This approach has a mathematical elegance, but can be problematic in various calculations and intuitive understanding. A second approach can be called a \\"concrete approach\\"; as it is capable of simply and naturally generalizing a broad class of concepts from ordinary mathematics. It requires the use of an infinite number of supersymmetric generators in its definition; however, all but a finite number of these generators carry no content, as the concrete approach requires the use of a coarse topology that renders almost all of them equivalent. Surprisingly, these two definitions, one with a finite number of supersymmetric generators, and one with an infinite number of generators, are equivalent.Rogers, Op. Cit. (See Chapter 8.) A third approach describes a supermanifold as a base topos of a superpoint. This approach remains the topic of active research. =Algebro-geometric: as a sheaf= Although supermanifolds are special cases of noncommutative manifolds, their local structure makes them better suited to study with the tools of standard differential geometry and locally ringed spaces. A supermanifold M of dimension (p,q) is a topological space M with a sheaf of superalgebras, usually denoted OM or C‚àû(M), that is locally isomorphic to C^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}^p)\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda^\\\\bullet(\\\\xi_1,\\\\dots\\\\xi_q), where the latter is a Grassmann algebra on q generators. A supermanifold M of dimension (1,1) is sometimes called a super-Riemann surface. Historically, this approach is associated with Felix Berezin, Dimitry Leites, and Bertram Kostant. =Concrete: as a smooth manifold= A different definition describes a supermanifold in a fashion that is similar to that of a smooth manifold, except that the model space \\\\mathbb{R}^p has been replaced by the model superspace \\\\mathbb{R}^p_c\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^q_a. To correctly define this, it is necessary to explain what \\\\mathbb{R}_c and \\\\mathbb{R}_a are. These are given as the even and odd real subspaces of the one-dimensional space of Grassmann numbers, which, by convention, are generated by a countably infinite number of anti-commuting variables: i.e. the one-dimensional space is given by \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda(V), where V is infinite-dimensional. An element z is termed real if z=z^*; real elements consisting of only an even number of Grassmann generators form the space \\\\mathbb{R}_c of c-numbers, while real elements consisting of only an odd number of Grassmann generators form the space \\\\mathbb{R}_a of a-numbers. Note that c-numbers commute, while a-numbers anti-commute. The spaces \\\\mathbb{R}^p_c and \\\\mathbb{R}^q_a are then defined as the p-fold and q-fold Cartesian products of \\\\mathbb{R}_c and \\\\mathbb{R}_a.Bryce DeWitt, Supermanifolds, (1984) Cambridge University Press (See chapter 2.) Just as in the case of an ordinary manifold, the supermanifold is then defined as a collection of charts glued together with differentiable transition functions. This definition in terms of charts requires that the transition functions have a smooth structure and a non- vanishing Jacobian. This can only be accomplished if the individual charts use a topology that is considerably coarser than the vector-space topology on the Grassmann algebra. This topology is obtained by projecting \\\\mathbb{R}^p_c down to \\\\mathbb{R}^p and then using the natural topology on that. The resulting topology is not Hausdorff, but may be termed \\"projectively Hausdorff\\". That this definition is equivalent to the first one is not at all obvious; however, it is the use of the coarse topology that makes it so, by rendering most of the \\"points\\" identical. That is, \\\\mathbb{R}^p_c\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^q_a with the coarse topology is essentially isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{R}^p\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda^\\\\bullet(\\\\xi_1,\\\\dots\\\\xi_q) Historically, this approach is associated with Alice Rogers, Bryce DeWitt and work by Jadczyk and Pilch.A. Jadczyk, K. Pilch, \\"Superspaces and supersymmetries\\". Comm. Math. Phys. 78 (1980), no. 3, pp373--390.  Properties  Unlike a regular manifold, a supermanifold is not entirely composed of a set of points. Instead, one takes the dual point of view that the structure of a supermanifold M is contained in its sheaf OM of \\"smooth functions\\". In the dual point of view, an injective map corresponds to a surjection of sheaves, and a surjective map corresponds to an injection of sheaves. An alternative approach to the dual point of view is to use the functor of points. If M is a supermanifold of dimension (p,q), then the underlying space M inherits the structure of a differentiable manifold whose sheaf of smooth functions is OM/I, where I is the ideal generated by all odd functions. Thus M is called the underlying space, or the body, of M. The quotient map OM ‚Üí OM/I corresponds to an injective map M ‚Üí M; thus M is a submanifold of M.  Examples  * Let M be a manifold. The odd tangent bundle Œ†TM is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Œ©(M) of differential forms on M. * More generally, let E ‚Üí M be a vector bundle. Then Œ†E is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Œì(ŒõE*). In fact, Œ† is a functor from the category of vector bundles to the category of supermanifolds. * Lie supergroups are examples of supermanifolds. Batchelor's theorem Batchelor's theorem states that every supermanifold is noncanonically isomorphic to a supermanifold of the form Œ†E. The word \\"noncanonically\\" prevents one from concluding that supermanifolds are simply glorified vector bundles; although the functor Œ† maps surjectively onto the isomorphism classes of supermanifolds, it is not an equivalence of categories. It was published by Marjorie Batchelor in 1979. The proof of Batchelor's theorem relies in an essential way on the existence of a partition of unity, so it does not hold for complex or real-analytic supermanifolds.  Odd symplectic structures  = Odd symplectic form = In many physical and geometric applications, a supermanifold comes equipped with an Grassmann-odd symplectic structure. All natural geometric objects on a supermanifold are graded. In particular, the bundle of two-forms is equipped with a grading. An odd symplectic form œâ on a supermanifold is a closed, odd form, inducing a non-degenerate pairing on TM. Such a supermanifold is called a P-manifold. Its graded dimension is necessarily (n,n), because the odd symplectic form induces a pairing of odd and even variables. There is a version of the Darboux theorem for P-manifolds, which allows one to equip a P-manifold locally with a set of coordinates where the odd symplectic form œâ is written as :\\\\omega = \\\\sum_{i} d\\\\xi_i \\\\wedge dx_i , where x_i are even coordinates, and \\\\xi_i odd coordinates. (An odd symplectic form should not be confused with a Grassmann- even symplectic form on a supermanifold. In contrast, the Darboux version of an even symplectic form is :\\\\sum_i dp_i \\\\wedge dq_i+\\\\sum_j \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_j}{2}(d\\\\xi_j)^2, where p_i,q_i are even coordinates, \\\\xi_i odd coordinates and \\\\varepsilon_j are either +1 or -1.) =Antibracket= Given an odd symplectic 2-form œâ one may define a Poisson bracket known as the antibracket of any two functions F and G on a supermanifold by ::\\\\\\\\{F,G\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial_rF}{\\\\partial z^i}\\\\omega^{ij}(z)\\\\frac{\\\\partial_lG}{\\\\partial z^j}. Here \\\\partial_r and \\\\partial_l are the right and left derivatives respectively and z are the coordinates of the supermanifold. Equipped with this bracket, the algebra of functions on a supermanifold becomes an antibracket algebra. A coordinate transformation that preserves the antibracket is called a P-transformation. If the Berezinian of a P-transformation is equal to one then it is called an SP- transformation. =P and SP-manifolds= Using the Darboux theorem for odd symplectic forms one can show that P-manifolds are constructed from open sets of superspaces {\\\\mathcal{R}}^{nn} glued together by P-transformations. A manifold is said to be an SP-manifold if these transition functions can be chosen to be SP-transformations. Equivalently one may define an SP-manifold as a supermanifold with a nondegenerate odd 2-form œâ and a density function œÅ such that on each coordinate patch there exist Darboux coordinates in which œÅ is identically equal to one. =Laplacian= One may define a Laplacian operator Œî on an SP-manifold as the operator which takes a function H to one half of the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. Explicitly one defines :::\\\\Delta H=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial_r}{\\\\partial z^a}\\\\left(\\\\rho\\\\omega^{ij}(z)\\\\frac{\\\\partial_l H}{\\\\partial z^j}\\\\right). In Darboux coordinates this definition reduces to ::::\\\\Delta=\\\\frac{\\\\partial_r}{\\\\partial x^a}\\\\frac{\\\\partial_l}{\\\\partial \\\\theta_a} where xa and Œ∏a are even and odd coordinates such that ::::\\\\omega=dx^a\\\\wedge d\\\\theta_a. The Laplacian is odd and nilpotent ::::\\\\Delta^2=0. One may define the cohomology of functions H with respect to the Laplacian. In Geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization, Albert Schwarz has proven that the integral of a function H over a Lagrangian submanifold L depends only on the cohomology class of H and on the homology class of the body of L in the body of the ambient supermanifold.  SUSY  A pre-SUSY-structure on a supermanifold of dimension (n,m) is an odd m-dimensional distribution P\\\\subset TM. With such a distribution one associates its Frobenius tensor S^2 P \\\\mapsto TM/P (since P is odd, the skew-symmetric Frobenius tensor is a symmetric operation). If this tensor is non-degenerate, e.g. lies in an open orbit of GL(P)\\\\times GL(TM/P), M is called a SUSY-manifold. SUSY-structure in dimension (1, k) is the same as odd contact structure.

He later became Union Minister of Human Resource Development in the Manmohan Singh cabinet from 2004 to 2009. Family Singh's father was Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh of Churhat thikana. His son Ajay Singh aka Rahul Bhaiya is former leader of opposition in Madhya pradesh assembly. His grandson Kunwar Aishwarya Singh is married to Devyani Rana, great-granddaughter of Shree Tin Maharaja Mohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, former Prime Minister of Nepal. She is daughter of Nepalese politician Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana and Usharaje Scindia, daughter of Gwalior King Jivajirao Scindia. His another grandson through Ajay Singh is Arunoday Singh, a Bollywood actor. Death Singh died on 4 March 2011, at the age of 80. He had been admitted in Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences a few days previously with chest neurological problems and died of a heart attack.Veteran Congress leader Arjun Singh dies He was cremated at his home town of Churhat, Madhya Pradesh.Veteran Congress leader Arjun Singh dies Career left He was a minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao cabinet but he resigned after the Babri Masjid demolition. At the time, he formed the All India Indira Congress (Tiwari) along with Narayan Dutt Tiwari, former Union minister and ex-CM of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand (formerly Uttaranchal) as President, but he lost in the 1996 Loksabha elections from Satna in Madhya Pradesh and the Congress too lost power at the center. Later he returned to Congress and lost again from Hoshangabad in Madhya Pradesh. He served as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh three times, Union minister and Governor of Punjab once for a short period. As Governor of Punjab, he worked for the Rajiv- Longowal Accord for peace in Punjab. He was awarded the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award in 2000. Controversies =Bhopal Incident= Arjun Singh was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh when the deadly gas leak from the Union Carbide factory occurred. It is widely alleged that on the fateful night between 2 and 3 December 1984, when the gas leak occurred, Arjun Singh fled to his Kerwa Dam Palace (outside Bhopal) to save himself from deadly effects of leaked gas and was not available to manage the crisis or lead the administration.Arjun Singh, the missing MP Chief Minister during Bhopal Gas tragedy Subsequently, the Arjun Singh government's mishandling was criticised by the court in the verdict on Bhopal incident pronounced by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhopal on 7 June 2010. The media raised serious questions about his role in the release of Warren Anderson.\\"How Anderson came and left\\", The Bhopal Post, 9 June 2010. In particular, the pilot of the aircraft in which Warren Anderson flew out of India after the gas leak, has recorded that the final sanction to permit the flight came from Arjun Singh's office. =Churhat lottery case and Kerwa Dam palace= While Arjun Singh was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was involved in the scandal which was called by some the Churhat Lottery case. The Churhat Children Welfare Society was floated in 1982 by relatives of Singh, and permitted to raise funds via lottery, and also given tax relief as a charity. p. 89 However, there were widespread allegations that a substantial sums were siphoned off and used to construct the lavish Kerwa Dam palace near Bhopal. The donations to the society included a Rs 150,000 donation from Union Carbide, whose chief Warren Anderson was permitted to leave the country after the gas leak, allegedly by Arjun Singh's office. At a public litigation hearing the high court observed that \\"Arjun Singh owed an explanation to the nation about the costs and sources of construction of the palatial mansion in Bhopal\\". While Singh had claimed the value of the palace was Rs 1.8 million, the IT Department estimated the cost at above Rs one crore. However, a one-judge commission investigating the scandal gave a clean chit to Arjun Singh. The case was re- opened however, after the Jain Hawala case, and Singh was asked to submit fresh re-estimates of the palace cost. In court, the case was argued by Kapil Sibal and the order for re-examination was squashed on the grounds that it had been issued in a haste and \\"had not applied his mind\\". =Other controversies= After the Mumbai train bombings of 2006, he reportedly quoted at a Cabinet meeting the statements of a former judge of the Maharashtra High Court that an earlier attempt on the headquarters of the Hindu revivalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Nagpur had been a plot set into motion by the Sangh itself. This followed his denouncement of the Ekal Vidyalayas, one- teacher schools run for the benefit of the tribals of India by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad., as communal. A case under the Anti-Dowry Act has been registered against Arjun Singh. Mayawati government has decided to seek CBI inquiry into dowry harassment case. Arjun Singh was accused of irregularities and corruption in the grant of Deemed University status to private for-profit educational institutions which did not meet requisite educational standards, during his tenure as Minister for Human Resources Development. The Government of India initiated proceedings to repeal the \\"Deemed University\\" status of 44 such institutions in Jan 2010.

Yamaha XG (EXtended General MIDI) is an extension to the General MIDI standard, created by Yamaha. It is similar in purpose to the Roland GS standard. Features Relative to General MIDI, XG gained popularity by increasing the number of available instruments from 128 to 480 (361 in some interpretations) with additional 11 drum kit sounds, and introduced a large set of standard controllers and parameters that composers could employ to achieve greater subtlety and realism in their compositions. The XG also has a synthesizer that provides a 32/64 note polyphonic feature which is shared through the supported 16 MIDI channels. XG has a wide range of sounds to form such complex chords and produces a vast variety of lower synthesizer sounds to choose from. History In 1994, Yamaha released the first XG-based product: Yamaha MU80 Tone Generator. In 1995, Yamaha released the first XG-based product for PC users, the DB50XG daughterboard, a Creative Wave Blaster competitor. In 1996, Yamaha released MU10 external module, basically a DB50XG in a case and later the SW60XG ISA PC card. Coupled with their tone-generator, both devices included an on-board 4MB sound bank chip of sampled instruments and became highly desirable among MIDI fans due to their crisp, high-quality sounds similar to the newer models of Roland Sound Canvas . These devices feature an effects processing system with individual stereo reverb and chorus effects on any of 16 channels, and the ability to route any of the channels through an additional 'insertion' effect, and even guitar amp and wah-wah pedal simulations. Yamaha's in-house songwriters often utilized these tools to demonstrate the power of the XG format, notably recreating Jimi Hendrix leads complete with feedback, flamenco guitar with distinct pick/hammered notes and finger slides, growling saxophones, and even a very convincing sitar . Discontinued products The DB50XG, SW60XG and SW1000XG are all discontinued. The SW1000XG was popular in the professional music industry, and many of Yamaha's amateur and professional keyboards implement either XG or a subset, known as \\"XGlite\\". Many notebooks include the Yamaha YMF7xx chipset which has a scaled-down XG-compatible MIDI synth. The DB60XG, a DB50XG with an analog input, is available only in Japan. .Most XG standard tone generators can switch itself into TG300B mode, which is an emulation of the competing Roland GS standard that allows adequate playback of musical data bearing the GS logo. The XG-compatible Yamaha S-YXG50 SoftSynthesizer, which is discontinued, is an entirely software-based MIDI synth. It used a 2 MB or 4 MB wavetable sound set, and was common among non- professional users who needed a cheap, high-quality MIDI synthesizer for purposes such as playing games that rely on MIDI to produce music and sound effects. Korg compatibility Korg, due to its close relationship with Yamaha, released three instruments with XG compatibility: * the NS5R, which offered XG compatibility through an add-in daughterboard; * the NX5R, electronically similar to the NS5R, except that the daughterboard is part of the instrument; * the N-series of keyboards and modules, which also offered support for Roland's GS and GM2 standards as well. Korg was the only manufacturer outside of Yamaha to produce XG-certified instruments.

He was considered a prominent poet and playwright and proponent of Bohemianism during the first quarter of the twentieth century. His work was admired by writers as diverse as Jack London, Upton Sinclair, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, but is largely neglected today. Life and career Sterling was born in Sag Harbor, New York, the eldest of nine children. His father was Dr. George A. Sterling, a physician who determined to make a priest of one of his sons, and George was selected to attend, for three years, St. Charles College in Maryland. He was instructed in English by poet John B. Tabb. His mother Mary was a member of the Havens family, prominent in Sag Harbor and the Shelter Island area. Her brother, Frank C. Havens, Sterling's uncle, went to San Francisco in the late 19th century and established himself as a prominent lawyer and real estate developer. Sterling eventually followed him to the West in 1890 and worked as a real estate broker in Oakland, California. With the publication of his small volume of poetry in 1903, The Testimony of the Sun and Other Poems, he quickly became a hero among the East Bay literati and artists, some of whom included Joaquin Miller, Jack London, Xavier Martinez, Harry Leon Wilson, Perry H. Newberry, Henry Lafler, Gelett Burgess, and James Hopper. Portrait photograph of George Sterling taken by Arnold Genthe February 9, 1904Dear Master: Letters of George Sterling to Ambrose Bierce, 1900‚Äì1912, Roger K. Larson, ed. (San Francisco: Book Club of California, 2002), p. 65. In 1905 Sterling moved 120 miles south to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, an undeveloped coastal paradise, and soon established a settlement for like- minded Bohemian writers and other children of the counterculture. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). A parallel colony of painters was also developing in this enclave. Carmel had been discovered by Charles Warren Stoddard and others, but Sterling made it world-famous. His aunt Mrs. Havens purchased a home for him in Carmel Pines where he lived for nine years. In addition to the Bay Area residents mentioned above, Sterling managed to attract, as either visitors or semi-permanent residents, the satirical iconoclast Ambrose Bierce, novelist Mary Austin,See Austin, Mary, \\"George Sterling at Carmel\\", The American Mercury May 1927, pp. 65‚Äì72. art photographer Arnold Genthe, writer Clark Ashton Smith, and poet Robinson Jeffers. When a firestorm of controversy followed Sterling's publication of A Wine of Wizardry in the Cosmopolitan magazine of September 1907, other rebels flocked to Carmel, including Upton Sinclair and the MacGowan sisters. The suicide by poison of the young poet Nora May French in Sterling's home drew national press coverage.San Francisco Examiner: November 15, 1907, pp.1f; November 17, 1907, p.54.San Francisco Call: November 15, 1907, pp.1f; November 16, 1907, pp.1f.San Francisco Chronicle, November 15, 1907, pp. 1f.The Oakland Tribune, November 15, 1907, p.4. The suicide of Sterling's wife by cyanide only added fuel to the flames. Sterling's own diaries and correspondence reveal a more sedate, but still Bohemian community.George Sterling, Diaries, 1905‚Äì1913 (unpublished manuscript), George Sterling Correspondence and Papers, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley. He often volunteered at Carmel's Forest Theatre and once played a starring role in Mary Austin's play The Fire. He is depicted twice in Jack London's novels: as Russ Brissenden in the autobiographical Martin Eden (1909) and as Mark Hall in The Valley of the Moon (1913). Sterling, posing with caricatures of himself at the Bohemian Grove, 1907 Kevin Starr (1973) wrote: > The uncrowned King of Bohemia (so his friends called him), Sterling had been > at the center of every artistic circle in the San Francisco Bay Area. > Celebrated as the embodiment of the local artistic scene, though forgotten > today, Sterling had in his lifetime been linked with the immortals, his name > carved on the walls of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition next to > the great poets of the past. Joseph Noel (1940) says that Sterling's poem, A Wine of Wizardry,A Wine of Wizardry at www.idiom.com has \\"been classed by many authorities as the greatest poem ever written by an American author.\\" According to Noel, Sterling sent the final draft of A Wine of Wizardry to the normally acerbic and critical Ambrose Bierce. Bierce said \\"If I could find a flaw in it, I should quickly call your attention to it... It takes the breath away.\\" Sterling joined the Bohemian Club and acted in their theatrical productions each summer at the Bohemian Grove.Mencken, Henry Louis; Sterling, George; Joshi, S. T. From Baltimore to Bohemia: the letters of H.L. Mencken and George Sterling, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2001, p. 252. For the main Grove play in 1907, the club presented The Triumph of Bohemia, Sterling's verse drama depicting the battle between the \\"Spirit of Bohemia\\" and Mammon for the souls of the grove's woodmen.Weir, David. Decadent culture in the United States: art and literature against the American grain, 1890‚Äì1926, SUNY Press, 2007, p. 144. Sterling also supplied lyric for the musical numbers at the 1918 Grove play. Bierce, who acclaimed Sterling's poem The Testimony of the Suns, in his \\"Prattle\\" column in William Randolph Hearst's San Francisco Examiner, arranged for the publication of A Wine of Wizardry in the September 1907 number of Cosmopolitan, which afforded Sterling some national notice. In an introduction to the poem, Bierce wrote \\"Whatever length of days may be according to this magazine, it is not likely to do anything more notable in literature than it accomplished in this issue by the publication of Mr. George Sterling's poem, 'A Wine of Wizardry.'\\" Bierce wrote to Sterling, \\"I hardly know how to speak of it. No poem in English of equal length has so bewildering a wealth of imagination. Not Spencer himself has flung such a profusion of jewels into so small a casket\\". George Sterling posed for an illustration by Adelaide Hanscom Leeson which appeared in a printing of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Sterling fell into drinking and his wife departed. Noel, a personal acquaintance, says that when he began the poem, Sterling \\"was persuaded that there was another world than that we know. He repeated this to me so frequently that it became a trifle tiresome. Of the means he employed to get a glimpse of that other world, I am not so sure.\\" He observes that \\"many before Sterling had used narcotics to this end;\\" that \\"George, a doctor's son, had always had access to whatever drugs he fancied;\\" says that Sterling's wife said \\"that George had purloined a great quantity of opium from his brother Wickham,\\" and speaks of \\"internal evidence in the poem\\" in which \\"Sterling writes his Fancy awakened with a 'brow caressed by poppybloom.'\\" Despite all this, Noel makes a point of saying \\"there is no direct evidence that Sterling used narcotics.\\" Sterling also wrote for children The Saga of the Pony Express. Despite such famous mentors as Bierce and Ina Coolbrith, and his long association with London, Sterling himself never became well known outside California. Sterling's poetry is both visionary and mystical, but he also wrote ribald quatrains that were often unprintable and left unpublished. His style reflects the Romantic charm of such poets as Shelley, Keats and Poe, and he provided guidance and encouragement to the similarly-inclined Clark Ashton Smith at the beginning of Smith's own career. Sterling carried a vial of cyanide for many years. When asked about it he said, \\"A prison becomes a home if you have the key\\".The Documentary \\"The Gospel According to Philip K.

The play (and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations) gave rise to the term \\"gaslighting\\", meaning a form of psychological abuse in which false information is presented to victims with the intent of making them doubt their own memories, perceptions and judgements. Synopsis The play is set in fog-bound London in 1880, at the upper middle class home of Jack Manningham and his wife Bella. It is late afternoon, a time that Hamilton notes as the time \\"before the feeble dawn of gaslight and tea.\\" Bella is clearly on edge, and the stern reproaches of her overbearing husband (who flirts with the servants) make matters worse. What most perturbs Bella is Jack's unexplained disappearances from the house: he will not tell her where he is going, and this increases her anxiety. It becomes clear that Jack is intent on convincing Bella that she is going insane, even to the point of assuring her she is imagining that the gas light in the house is dimming. The appearance of a police detective called Rough leads Bella to realise that Jack is responsible for her torment. Rough explains that the apartment above was once occupied by one Alice Barlow, a wealthy woman who was murdered for her jewels. The murderer was never found. Jack goes to the flat each night to search for the jewels, and lighting the apartment's gas lights causes the lights to dim in the rest of the building. His footsteps in the supposedly empty apartment persuade Bella that she is \\"hearing things.\\" Rough convinces Bella to assist him in exposing Jack as the murderer, which she does, but not before she takes revenge on Jack by pretending to help him escape. At the last minute she reminds him that, having gone insane, she is not accountable for her actions. The play closes with Jack being led away by the police. Productions =London= Gas Light premiered on 5 December 1938 at the Richmond Theatre in Richmond, London. It transferred to the Apollo Theatre on 1 January 1939, and to the Savoy Theatre on 22 May 1939. The cast featured Dennis Arundell (Mr. Manningham), Milton Rosmer (Mr. Rough), Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies (Mrs. Manningham), Beatrice Rowe (Elizabeth) and Elizabeth Inglis (Nancy). The production closed 10 June 1939, after a total of 141 performances. =Broadway= In the spring of 1941, Vincent Price and his wife, actress Edith Barrett, saw Gas Light performed in Los Angeles as a three-hander titled Five Chelsea Lane. They were impressed by the play and set about securing the rights for a Broadway production of their own. By fall, they had found a producer to underwrite the project, but Barrett abruptly withdrew to remain in Hollywood and work in films. In November 1941, Price returned to work on the New York stage. Judith Evelyn, the Canadian actress who played the role of Mrs. Manningham in Los Angeles, joined the Broadway production. The name of the play changed to Angel Street. Angel Street premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on 5 December 1941, produced and directed by Shepard Traube. The cast featured Leo G. Carroll (Rough), Florence Edney (Elizabeth), Elizabeth Eustis (Nancy), Judith Evelyn (Mrs. Manningham) and Vincent Price (Mr. Manningham).\\" 'Angel Street' Listing\\" playbillvault.com, accessed 20 June 2013 Price left the play after a year, when his working relationship with Evelyn deteriorated into what she later described as \\"violent dislike\\". In December 1942, John Emery assumed the role of Mr. Manningham. In a long profile headlined ‚ÄúThe Triumph of Traube,‚Äú published on 14 March 1943, The New York Times described some of the challenges faced by the production, including the untimely opening date, two days before Pearl Harbor: ‚ÄúOn Dec. 5 the play opened, on Dec. 6 the rave reviews had sent a long line of pilgrims to the theatre box office, on Dec. 7 the play was forgotten under the impact of the Japanese attack. Angel Street wabbled momentarily then picked up its stride, which has hardly slackened since.‚Äù The play transferred to the Bijou Theatre on 2 October 1944, and closed on 30 December 1944, after 1,295 performances. =On tour= On 19 December 1941, The New York Times announced that Traube had cancelled a trip to the West Coast in order to form a touring company for Angel Street. The tour was to begin in Baltimore in February, with stops including Washington, D.C.; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Chicago, Illinois. On Sunday, 15 March1942, the touring company of Angel Street opened in Chicago to rave reviews. The New York Times reported an observation by Chicago critic Robert Pollak that ‚ÄúNot since Hellzapoppin' had the crowd out front participated so heartily‚Äù.The New York Times blurb credits Pollak with writing for ‚ÄúThe Daily Times‚Äù, i.e., The Chicago Sun Times. =Revivals= Angel Street was added to the repertory of The American Negro Players in 1947. The play ran at New York City Center from 22 January 1948 to 1 February 1948, for 14 performances. Directed by Richard Barr, the cast featured Jos√© Ferrer (Mr. Manningham), Uta Hagen (Mrs. Manningham), Phyllis Hill (Nancy), Nan McFarland (Elizabeth), Ralph Roberts (Policeman), Victor Thorley (Policeman) and Richard Whorf (Rough).\\" 'Angel Street', 1948\\" playbillvault.com, accessed 20 June 2013 On 19 August 1952, The New York Times announced that a new off-Broadway group, Hamilton-Bruder Productions (a partnership of Patrick Hamilton and Janet Bruders) was opening with a revival of Angel Street. The play was revived on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre, opening on 26 December 1975 and closing on 8 February 1976 after 52 performances and 4 previews. Again directed by Shepard Traube, the cast featured Michael Allinson (Mr. Manningham), Dina Merrill (Mrs. Manningham), Christine Andreas (Nancy), Bette Henritze (Elizabeth) and Robert E.

In 2019 Perth Theatre staged a production of \\"Gaslight\\" as part of their Winter / Spring season. Reception  Angel Street was a hit in its Broadway premiere, and it remains one of the longest-running non-musicals in Broadway history, with 1,295 total performances. philadelphiaweekly.com It remains a perennial favourite with both repertory and amateur theatre companies. The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson opens his 6 December 1941 review with this observation: ‚ÄúAlthough Patrick Hamilton writes his thrillers within a small compass, he writes them with infinite craft and dexterity. Angel Street, which sent a chill up the spine of the Golden Theatre last evening, comes off the top part of the theatre's top shelf.‚Äù Atkinson praises Straube for matching ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äôs skill in a tingling performance that fills the theater with an ominous and terrifying illusion‚Äù and commends all the actors, observing that Leo G. Carroll had his best role in years. In his review of the 1948 City Center production, Louis Kronenberger wrote: \\"(It) remains one of the better thrillers ... let's call it one of the best. All the same, though it holds up nicely for three acts, it seems to me outstandingly good for only one.\\"Kronenberger, Louis. \\"Victorian Villainy at the City Center\\" fultonhistory.com, 25 January 1948 Reviewing Traube's 1975 Broadway revival, Clive Barnes asked: ‚ÄúWhatever happened to the good, old‚Äêfashioned melodrama? It probably drifted over to television and died. Just about 35 years ago...Patrick Hamilton's English thriller, Angel Street, opened on Broadway with resounding success. It was directed and produced by Shepard Traube. Last night, at the Lyceum Theater, Mr. Traube attempted an encore. It was not called for... The trouble with this play is not the trouble with this particular play‚Äîit is the trouble with this play as a particular. The theater cannot afford the luxury anymore of wilting heroines, villains making out as if they were Vincent Price (35 years ago it was Vincent Price!) or detectives detecting with the solidity of a basset hound... Nothing is quite clever enough in Angel Street, and the atmosphere is so rarefied that the play is artistically in dire need of oxygen.‚Äù On 24 May 2007, in her review of the Irish Repertory Theatre revival, The New York Times' Ginia Bellafante observed that Gaslight ‚Äúestablished the blueprint for a kind of domestic-peril thriller... Every time an actress..portrays the sort of wife who discovers that the greatest threat to her mental and physical safety is the man sitting in her breakfast nook, Mr. Hamilton‚Äôs estate ought to receive some type of remuneration....David Staller plays this undesirable husband as a man whose lust exempts nothing. Every time he appears onstage, you think: keep this person away from my babysitter and Rolex. Mr. Staller's rogue posture modulates his character's cruelty, leavening the play's potentially stifling mood. Mr. Hamilton believed our most dangerous enemies were always in the room with us ..., and his work can feel claustrophobic.According to New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante, ‚ÄúHamilton wrote Gaslight during an especially grim decade in an unhappy life, six years after he was struck by a drunken driver in an accident that left him permanently disfigured, and four years after his mother killed herself.‚Äú https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/theater/reviews/24gasl.html Ms. Moore is aware of this, providing the proper ventilation to clear much of the Victorian must. Brian Murray, playing the detective who uncovers Manningham's plan, is her greatest asset in this regard. He appears onstage with the red cheeks of a Santa Claus, an ageing imp who hides out in nooks and corners, showing a benevolent sarcasm that teases Bella out of her dimwitted complacency‚Äù.Bellafante, Ginia. \\"Theater Review.

The city was almost totally destroyed with no major monuments left standing. This, however, was not the end. The Home Army was in disarray and unprepared to deal with the Soviet NKVD which subsequently took control of Poland and sent many of the former resistance fighters to their deaths in Siberian gulags. The political effect is a matter of controversy. Some claim that without the uprising, Poland would have become a Soviet republic, whilst others claim that the uprising itself was the mistake which enabled Joseph Stalin to arrange for his enemies to destroy his inconvenient allies and left Poland fatally weakened. Destruction of the city The legacy Due to lack of cooperation and often the active aggressive moves on the part of the Soviets and several other factors, Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal‚Äîto free part of Polish territories, so that a government loyal to Polish government in exile could be established there instead of a Soviet puppet state. There is no consensus among historians if that was ever possible, and if those operations had other lasting effect. Some argue that without Operation Tempest and Warsaw Uprising, Poland would end as a Soviet republic, a fate definitely worse than that of independent puppet state, and thus the Operation succeeded at least partially in being a political demonstration to Soviets and Western Allies. Shrapnel holes are still visible on the walls of many buildings in Warsaw Armia Krajowa soldiers who remained in Poland Most soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were persecuted after the war; captured by the NKVD or SB, interrogated and imprisoned, awaiting trials on various charges. Many of them were sent to Gulags or executed. Armia Krajowa soldiers who were liberated by the Western Allies PowƒÖzki Cemetery Most of those sent to POW camps in Germany were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and stayed in the West, including uprising leaders Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski and Antoni Chru≈õciel, who stayed in London and the United States, respectively. Some chose to return to Poland in the hope of rejoining their families. In many cases, those who returned shared the fate of their comrades who had spent their entire time in Poland. Long-term effect on Communist Poland The courage of the Warsaw Uprising, kept anti-Soviet sentiment high in Poland throughout the Cold War. The post-war Communist regime attempted to counter this sentiment with extensive propaganda that downplayed and even outright denied Soviet culpability. Nevertheless, memories of the uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement Solidarity, which led a peaceful movement against the Communist government during the 1980s, leading to the downfall of that government in 1989 and the emergence of democracy.

Chrism, also called myrrh, myron, holy anointing oil, and consecrated oil, is a consecrated oil used in the Anglican, Assyrian, Catholic, Old Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Latter Day Saint, and Nordic Lutheran churches in the administration of certain sacraments and ecclesiastical functions. Name The English chrism derives from Koine Greek via Latin and Old French. In Greek, khr√Æsma () was originally the verbal noun (\\"(the act of) anointing\\", \\"unction\\") of (\\"anoint\\").Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed. \\"chrism, n.\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1889. By extension, along with khr√Æma (), khr√Æstai (), and later khr√≠sma (), it came to be used for the anointing oil or ointment itself. Khr√≠sma came into Latin as ', which appears in the works of Tertullian. This was adopted directly into Old English as ', which developed into Middle English ' and various related spellings. In Old French, the original Latin was conflated with ' (\\"cream\\"), developing into ', which was also borrowed into Middle English around 1300 as ' and various related spellings. The spelling chrism after the Latin original was generally adopted in the 16th century, after which \\"cream\\" came to be restricted to its present meaning. The Proto-Indo- European root from which the Greek term derived has been reconstructed as *ghrei- (\\"to trickle\\"). This is cognate with Sanskrit gh·πõt…ô (, from the radix (‡§≠‡§æ‡§∏‡•á / ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞‡§£‡•á / ‡§õ‡§æ‡§¶‡§®‡•á), which means to shine / to trickle / to cover) and Hindi ghƒ´ (, \\"ghee\\"), as well as Lithuanian ' (\\"skimming\\"), Middle Low German ' (\\"grime\\"), Old English ' (\\"mask, helm, spectre\\", presumably from an original sense of \\"covering\\" or \\"concealment\\"), English grime, and possibly Phrygian ' (\\"painted, ornamented, inscribed\\"). Chrism can be also a Myron or myrrh. Myron is an oil that is blessed by a bishop. Early Christian usage Multiple early Christian documents discuss the \\"ordinance\\" or \\"several ceremonies...explained in the Apostolical Constitutions\\" of \\"chrism\\", including documents by Theophilus (d. 181) and Tertullian (d. 220). The most detailed version of the practice is by Cyril of Jerusalem who details how ointment or oil was \\"symbolically applied to the forehead, and the other organs of sense\\" and that the \\"ears, nostrils, and breast were each to be anointed.\\" Cyril states that the \\"ointment is the seal of the covenants\\" of baptism and God‚Äôs promises to the Christian who is anointed. Cyril taught that being \\"anointed with the Holy anointing oil of God\\" was the sign of a Christian, and a physical representation of having the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and it retains this meaning in Catholicism and Orthodoxy today. He says, \\"Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth. For before you were deemed worthy of this grace, ye had properly no right to this title, but were advancing on your way towards being Christians.\\"(On the Mysteries 3.5)Eric Segelberg, \\"The Benedictio Olei in the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus\\", (Oriens Christianus 48, 1964) Orthodox Christianity =Eastern Orthodox Church= Chrismarium used in Russia. The vessel is named \\"Alabaster\\" in reference to . Within the Orthodox Church chrism plays a part in many liturgical services and sacraments. The first sacrament that uses chrism, the sacrament of Chrismation, is the second of the three Sacraments of Initiation (Baptism, Chrismation, and Divine Eucharist). For the Orthodox, Chrismation canonically must be administered in conjunction with baptism, except in a case of true necessity. Here the blessing of the bishop upon the chrism functions as a substitute for the direct imposition of hands. Another use is in the consecration of church buildings, involving the anointing of the walls and of the altar table. Formerly, emperors and kings of monarchies where Orthodoxy was the state religion would receive anointment with chrism at their coronation. Stove and vessels for preparation of Chrism, 18th century (former Patriarchal residence, 169x169px The Orthodox Church makes chrism during Holy Week beginning on Holy Monday and culminating in the Divine Liturgy on Holy Thursday when it is carried in the Great Entrance and placed upon the altar. It consists primarily of olive oil with the addition of a range of aromatic essences, patterned after the anointing oil described in . Holy Myron is confected only by a bishop, without prejudice to particular law which reserves this power to the patriarch. In Russian tradition: > [...] into each vessel of new myrrh are poured a few drops of the old myrrh > [...] This is done in token of the uninterrupted connection of the Russian > Church with the Greek, from which she received [...] the first consecrated > myrrh. 169x169px On completion, chrism is distributed to all the bishops, who, in turn, give it to their parishes when needed. It is not made on a yearly basis, but only when supplies run short. The Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople produces chrism roughly once every 10 years using an ancient formula of the Jewish prophets and patriarchs that calls for 64 ingredients,Alfeyev, Hilarion (2001) Le Myst√®re de la foi (Cerf, Paris) while the flame needed to boil the mixture during the preparation is made by burning old and disfigured icons. The preparation of the Chrism in the Patriarchate is carried out by the college of the Kosmƒìtores Myrepso√≠ (Greek: ŒöŒøœÉŒºŒÆœÑŒøœÅŒµœÇ ŒúœÖœÅŒµœàŒøŒØ, \\"Deans Perfumers\\"), presided by the √Årch≈çn Myreps√≥s, the \\"Lord Perfumer\\". The incumbent Archon Myrepsos is biochemist Prodromos Thanasoglou. In Byzantine times the official responsible was the Grand Sacristan of the Patriarchate, but since then the specific office of the Archon Myrepsos was created. Laity are not allowed to handle either the chrism or the vessels containing it, therefore the Myrepsoi undergo a sort of \\"temporary ordination\\" into the clergy and are given by the Patriarch a gold \\"Cross of Ministry\\" to hang from their necks for the duration of their four-day service. The Archon is given the lention, a silk \\"towel\\" or apron. Three copper cauldrons are used for the preparation: the largest contains olive oil, the smallest contains water and the aromatic ingredients and the middle contains wine, which allows the oil to boil without catching fire. The preparation involves several steps, some‚Äîsuch as the addition of musk and rose oil‚Äîperformed by the Patriarch himself. Once the Chrism is filtered and ready, it is consecrated for the final time and stored in silver vessels in the Chapel of Saint Andrew, pending distribution. =Oriental Orthodox Churches= Malankara Orthodox Church Malankara Orthodox Church by Primate Paulose II (2018) In the Malankara Orthodox Church, it is believed that Christ taught the holy apostles how to consecrate the myron or chrism. As a tradition, only the primate or Catholicos of the East can consecrate the chrism.The primate is clothed in white vestments, \\"corresponding to the light of his soul, and with the purity of his person, as the mystery indicates to him that it should be offered to God in purity.\\" Present with the primate are twelve priest who represent the twelve apostles, twelve censers indicating the preaching of the Gospel, twelve lamps to symbolize the luminous revelations that descend upon them and twelve fans to indicate that it is not right that the divine mysteries should be revealed to those who are unworthy. Armenian Apostolic Church The Armenian Apostolic Church consecrates myrrh every seven years in autumn at Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Armenia. Western Christianity =Roman Catholicism= Chrismatory for ritual oil from Germany, 1636 (silver-gilt, Victoria and Albert Museum, London) A bishop pouring balsam into oil at Chrism Mass Chrism is essential for the Catholic Sacrament of Confirmation/Chrismation, and is prominently used in the sacraments of Baptism and Holy Orders. Those to be confirmed or chrismated, after receiving the laying on of hands, are anointed on the head by the bishop or priest. In baptism, if the person baptized is not to be immediately confirmed or chrismated, the minister anoints them with chrism. Newly ordained priests are anointed with chrism on the palms of their hands, and newly ordained bishops receive an anointing of chrism on their foreheads. It is also used in the consecration of objects such as churches and altars. In the ancient Liturgy prior to the reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council, that is still retained today as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, employed by certain ecclesiastical communities, the use of Chrism during the administration of Holy Orders differs: in the older form of the Roman Rite, priests are anointed in the hands only with the oil of catechumens, while bishops consecrated with the old ritual are anointed both in the head and in the hands with Chrism. Before the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, chrism had to be used to consecrate patens and chalices as well. The sign of the cross would be made with the chrism on the interior parts the chalice and paten where the Eucharist would rest; the Cross would then be smeared to cover the entire interior parts. The chalice and paten would need to be consecrated with the chrism again if they were re-gilded. This ritual could only be performed by a Bishop or a priest with the faculties to do so. According to the new rubrics, a simple blessing suffices. However, it is still permitted that the bishop performs the consecration with chrism. Chrism is made of olive oil and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually balsam. Under normal circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the bishop of the particular church in the presence of the presbyterium at the Chrism Mass, which takes place in the morning of Holy Thursday. The oil of catechumens and the oil of the sick are also blessed at this Mass. These holy oils are usually stored in special vessels known as chrismaria and kept in a cabinet known as an ambry. When the oils are distributed to a priest for him to use in his ministry they are kept in a smaller vessel with three compartments, known as an \\"oil stock\\". There is also a type of oil stock that is shaped like a ring, to make the anointing easier. The \\"jewel\\" of the ring is a container with a removable lid. Holy Oils were also used, in the older form of the Roman Rite, for the anointing of kings during ceremonies of Coronation. Several local rites allowed for the use of Chrism in those coronation rites (e.g. in the pre-reformation English Coronation rite the anointing was with Chrism; Napoleon was anointed with Chrism by Pope Pius VII, etc). However, the general coronation rite of the Roman Liturgy, codified in the Roman Pontifical of Pope Clement VIII, prescribed the use of the oil of cathecumens for the anointing of kings. The original Holy Ampulla in its relic receptacle before 1793. The Holy Ampulla or Holy Ampoule (Sainte Ampoule in French) was a glass vial which, from its first recorded use by Pope Innocent II for the anointing of Louis VII in 1131Le Goff, Jacques; et al. Le sacre royal √† l'√©poque de Saint- Louis d'apr√®s le manuscrit latin 1246 de la BNF to the coronation of Louis XVI in 1774, held anointing oil for the coronations of the kings of France. In each French Coronation, one drop of this anointing oil was mixed with Chrism. Thus, French Coronations employed Chrism mixed with the oil of the Sainte Ampoule for the anointing of kings. The Sainte Ampoule was said to have been discovered by Hincmar the Archbishop of Reims when the sepulcher containing the body of Saint Remi was opened in the reign of Charles the Bald and identified with the baptism of Clovis I, the first Frankish king converted to Christianity; it was kept thereafter in the Abbey of Saint-Remi, Reims and brought with formality to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims at each coronation, where the emphasis was on the anointment rather than on the crowning.See Jean-Claude Bonne 2001, examining the coronation ordines from Charlemagne to Charles V, who commissioned a Livre du sacre, as C. Meredith Jones remarked, in reviewing Sir Francis Oppenheimer's monograph of the Holy Ampulla. Some remains of the content of the ampoule, destroyed in 1793 by French revolutionaries, were placed in a new reliquary made in time for the coronation of Charles XLa Sainte Ampoule et le sacre des rois de France, leblogdumesnil.unblog.fr and are kept since 1906 at the Archbishopric of Reims. Content of the Holy Ampulla kept at the archbishopric of Reims =Anglicanism and Lutheranism= The primary use of chrism in Anglican and Lutheran churches is for the Rite of Chrismation, which may be included as a part of Baptism, even for infants. The oil of chrism is also commonly used in Confirmation, although this practice is not followed by churches of these denominations that are in the evangelical tradition. Owing to this difference of practice, it is common for Anglican and Lutheran confirmation liturgies to refer to the use of chrism as an option. The liturgy of the Church of England states \\"Oil mixed with fragrant spices (traditionally called chrism), expressing the blessings of the messianic era and the richness of the Holy Spirit, may be used to accompany the confirmation\\".Common Worship - Christian Initiation, Church House Publishing 2006, , page 129. The confirmation liturgy of the Anglican Province of Southern Africa includes the rubric \\"The Bishop may sign them on the forehead, using at his discretion the Chrism\\".An Anglican Prayer Book, Church of the Province of Southern Africa, Collins 1989, , page 393. The liturgy of the Igreja Lusitana (Anglican Church in Portugal) states at the point of confirmation: \\"Os confirmandos ajoelham perante o Bispo. Este pode assinala-los na testa com o sinal da cruz, usando oleo proprio\\" (\\"The confirmands kneel before the Bishop. He may sign them on the forehead with the sign of the cross, using the proper oil\\").Liturgia da Igreja Lusitana (Catolica Apostolica Evangelica), Igreja Lusitana 1991 (privately published), page 246. The use of chrism in Anglican and Lutheran ordination liturgies is similarly presented as an option in most provinces. In the liturgy for the ordination of priests in the Church of England, for example, the instruction is: \\"The bishop may anoint the palms of the hands of each newly ordained priest, saying 'May God, who anointed the Christ with the Holy Spirit at his baptism, anoint and empower you to reconcile and bless his people'.\\"Common Worship - Ordination Services, Church House Publishing 2007, , page 50. There is a similar instruction for the ordination of Bishops, although they are anointed on the head, rather than the palms of the hands.Common Worship - Ordination Services, Church House Publishing 2007, , page 75. An important and specific use of chrism is in the Anointing during the Coronation of the British monarch. In this part of the Service, the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the Sovereign on the head, hands and heart. This is considered to be the holiest rite of the Service, so much so that it is shielded from the congregation's view by a canopy of state. This is also why it was not filmed during the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, nor was it photographed in 1937 during the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It occurs just prior to the presentation of the Crown Jewels to the Sovereign, which is in turn followed by the actual Coronation. Its other notable use is in the consecration of church buildings, where it may be used to anoint the walls, the altar/table, and the place for reservation of the Eucharistic sacrament for the sick. As in other traditions, chrism is usually olive oil (although other plant oils can be used in cases when olive oil is unavailable) and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually balsam. Under usual circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the bishop of the particular church in the presence of the presbyterium at the Chrism Eucharist, which takes place on Maundy Thursday or a day shortly before, where priestly ordination vows are often renewed also. The oil of catechumens and the oil of the sick are usually also consecrated at this liturgy. Practices vary for the blessing of the chrism, from interpolations within the Eucharistic Prayer, to specific prayers of consecration, used at the discretion of the minister. Some Lutheran and Anglican liturgical books, however, make provision for a pastor who is not a bishop (a presbyter) to consecrate chrism in time of need and in the absence of the bishop. =Latter Day Saints= Members of the Latter Day Saint movement also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints consider anointing to be an ordinance.\\"613 Administering to the Sick\\", LDS.org Gospel Topics. Members of the LDS church who hold the Melchizedek priesthood may use consecrated oil in performing the ordinance of blessing of the \\"sick or afflicted\\", although oil is not required if it is unavailable. The priesthood holder anoints the recipient's head with a drop of oil, then lays his hands upon that head and declares his act of anointing. Then another priesthood holder joins in, if available, and pronounces a \\"sealing\\" of the anointing and other words of blessing, as he feels inspired. Melchizedek priesthood holders are also authorized to consecrate any pure olive oil and often carry a personal supply in case they have need to perform a blessing. Oil is not used in other blessings, such as for people seeking comfort or counsel. The word \\"chrism\\" is not used. In addition to the reference, the Doctrine and Covenants contains numerous references to the anointing and healing of the sick by those with authority to do so.

Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz. He is recognized for his literary achievements, beginning with poetry and prose written after World War I. After 1989, he was often presented as a political opportunist during his mature years lived in communist Poland, where he held high offices (participated in the slander of Polish expatriates, literary and other figures who after World War II remained in the West). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. In 1988, he was recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations for his role in sheltering Jews during World War II.  Biography  Iwaszkiewicz was born in Kalnyk in Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine). After the death of his father (an accountant), he and his mother lived in Warsaw in 1902‚Äì1904, and then moved back to Kiev Governorate. He graduated from a secondary school in Kiev in 1912 and enrolled at the Law Faculty of Kiev University. In 1914, he travelled in Sicily and North Africa with his friend and distant cousin Karol Szymanowski, a composer for whose opera King Roger he later provided the libretto. After World War I, in October 1918 Iwaszkiewicz came to Warsaw, where he joined a group of young artists associated with the Pro Arte et Studio magazine. He had his public debut as a poet at the Pod Picadorem caf√© on 29 November. With Julian Tuwim and Antoni S≈Çonimski, he founded the Skamander group of experimental poets in 1919.Rados≈Çaw Romaniuk (13 April 2015), Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz i poczƒÖtki Skamandra.

Portrait of Iwaszkiewicz and his wife Anna by Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz (1922) He was appointed to be secretary of Maciej Rataj, marshal of the Sejm of the Second Polish Republic and served in that capacity in 1923‚Äì1925. Iwaszkiewicz worked for a magazine called Wiadomo≈õci Literackie ('The Literary News') in 1924‚Äì1939; he also published his works in numerous periodicals, including Gazeta Polska (1934‚Äì1938) and Ateneum (1938‚Äì1939). He was secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachƒôty Sztuk Piƒôknych) and from 1925 a member of the Polish PEN Club. From 1927 with the Foreign Ministry, first appointed the head of the art promotion section of the Press Department and later sent as secretary of the Polish mission to Copenhagen (1932‚Äì1935) and Brussels (1935‚Äì1936). He was a member of The Trade Union of Polish Writers (ZwiƒÖzek Zawodowy Literat√≥w Polskich, ZZLP) and in 1939 voted its vice-president. During World War II, Iwaszkiewicz participated in the Polish Underground State's activities, working in the Department of Education, Science and Culture of the Government Delegation for Poland. He collaborated with Prof. Stanis≈Çaw Lorentz in his efforts to protect and rescue Poland's works of art. Iwaszkiewicz and his wife Anna had extensive contacts within the Jewish-Polish intelligentsia circles and assisted their former neighbors, friends and acquaintances in a variety of ways during the German occupation of Poland. Iwaszkiewicz family's Villa Stawisko residence served as a hiding place for many Jews and Poles who faced the threat of being arrested by Nazi Germans, especially after the fall of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. At one time, more than 40 people were sheltered in the mansion. During the war, Stawisko also functioned as a center of Polish underground literature and art. Villa Stawisko in Podkowa Le≈õna houses the Anna and Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz Museum In 1945‚Äì1946, 1947‚Äì1949 and 1959‚Äì1980, Iwaszkiewicz served as head of the Polish Writers' Union. In 1945‚Äì1949 and 1955‚Äì1957 he was literary manager of the Polish Theatre in Warsaw. From March 1947 to December 1949, he published the Nowiny literackie ('Literary News') magazine. Beginning in 1956, for many years he was chief editor of the monthly Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá ('Creativity'). Vice-president of the Polish PEN Club in 1950‚Äì1965. Iwaszkiewicz was an organizer of the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace held in Wroc≈Çaw in 1948 and a delegate to the World Peace Congress in 1950. He served as a nonpartisan member of parliament from 1952 until his death in 1980. In his last three terms, he was the Senior Marshal of the Sejm. Iwaszkiewicz wrote of his deeply socialist convictions, but was ambivalent and privately bitter about the political reality of the Polish People's Republic, within which he officially functioned. Nevertheless, he was greatly impressed by the appreciation note that he received from Boles≈Çaw Bierut on the 40th anniversary of Iwaszkiewicz's literary career. In 1956, he was thrilled by the Polish October events. After a conversation with Edward Ochab in 1961, Iwaszkiewicz wrote: \\"They blame me for not having done anything as a member of the Sejm, but then they want me to be a deputy again\\". He continued his lifelong habit of making many foreign trips. Iwaszkiewicz wrote novels and short stories, poems, dramatic works, essays and columns, and translations from French, English, Russian and Danish literatures. His major epic novel is S≈Çawa i Chwa≈Ça ('Fame and Glory') ‚Äì a panorama of life of Polish intelligentsia in the first half of the 20th century. In particular, he is highly regarded for his short stories, a genre he developed and modernized. Using changing forms and themes, throughout his career Iwaszkiewicz produced collections of poems of major significance. He wrote plays based on classical motifs and many miscellaneous pieces reflecting his interests and pursuits in areas such as music and theatre, travel, and popularization of culture. In 1936, Iwaszkiewicz won the Golden Laurel (Polish: Z≈Çoty Wawrzyn) conferred by the Polish Academy of Literature. He was twice awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (1946 and 1947) and also the Order of the Builders of People's Poland in 1954. In 1955, he became the recipient of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic and the Medal of the 10th Anniversary of People's Poland. In 1970, he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. In 1974, Edward Gierek awarded him with the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Warsaw in 1971 and the Jagiellonian University in 1979, as well as numerous other Polish, foreign and international awards and distinctions. However, Iwaszkiewicz's works were removed in Poland from school recommended readings after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. They have since been regaining the recognition of their value and rank. Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz wrote the following: \\"Iwaszkiewicz is a great figure and nobody who deals with Polish literature can omit him. Even if some parts of his huge literary output are excluded, there is enough left, also as a testimony to the three epochs, to secure for him a place higher than that of any of his contemporaries\\". He concluded, \\"One is almost inclined to believe that some people are gripped by circumstances meant for them, and that for him the good fortunes, after his impoverished youth, began in the interwar period, to endure also later\\". For Mi≈Çosz could not imagine Iwaszkiewicz as an √©migr√© personality. Iwaszkiewicz died on 2 March 1980 and was buried on 5 March at the cemetery in Brwin√≥w near Warsaw, according to his last wish in a miner's uniform. Personal life In 1922, Iwaszkiewicz married Anna Lilpop (1897‚Äì1979), a writer and translator and daughter of Stanis≈Çaw Wilhelm Lilpop, a wealthy entrepreneur. The couple settled in Podkowa Le≈õna near Warsaw. In 1928, they moved to a newly built villa that Iwaszkiewicz named Stawisko. It currently houses a museum devoted to Iwaszkiewicz and his wife. They had two daughters: Maria (1924‚Äì2019) and Teresa (1928‚Äì2012). Iwaszkiewicz was bisexual and homoerotic; those themes are present in his poetry and prose works. In his diaries he describes himself as a \\"homosexual\\"; however, in light of the current understanding of human sexual orientation and his biography, he can be characterized as a bisexual. Iwaszkiewicz experienced and described a particularly intense relationship with a younger man terminally ill with tuberculosis; it commenced when the writer was over sixty years old. His wife always \\"knew of all of his affections\\". In 2012, his great-granddaughter Ludwika W≈Çodek wrote a best- selling biographical book about the life of her great-grandfather, titled Pra.

Here, on 29 November 1918, five poets opened the Picador Caf√©.Information from plaque placed on the building in 2006. Skamander was a Polish group of experimental poets founded in 1918 by Julian Tuwim, Antoni S≈Çonimski, Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz, Kazimierz Wierzy≈Ñski and Jan Lecho≈Ñ. Initially unnamed, in December 1919 it adopted the name Skamander, after the Scamander River in Asia Minor. It gave its name to the monthly review it published from 1920. History The group was initially closely related to the Pro Arte et Studio literary monthly and the Pod Picadorem (Picador) Caf√© in Warsaw. In 1920 it created its own publication, the Skamander monthly, though its members also collaborated with Wiadomo≈õci Literackie (Literary News) and other newspapers. The young poets were heavily influenced by Leopold Staff and other neoromantic poets. Their main aims were to break the links between history and poetry and to end the nationalist and patriotic functions of Polish poetry. They also emphasized the need to restore poetry to the common people by returning to everyday-language usage in poetry, including colloquialisms, neologisms and vulgarisms. Finally, the Skamandrites (Skamandryci) emphasized the beauty of everyday life and of all forms of life generally, including the biological side. In contrast to the basic aims of the late-19th-century Young Poland movement, Skamander's members eschewed semi- mythological heroes and protagonists, replacing them with common people. In contrast to the contemporary Awangarda Krakowska (Krak√≥w Avant-Garde) movement, they saw themselves as continuers of Polish literary traditions, especially those of romanticism and neoromanticism. Apart from the movement's five chief members, several lesser-known poets and critics adhered to its principles.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 8, 2011 river in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It is a major drainage feature of the Cumberland Plateau, a major tributary of the Cumberland River system, and the major feature of the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area. Physical geography The Big South Fork begins at the confluence of the New River and the Clear Fork in Scott County, Tennessee, and flows northwest, northeast, and north until ending at Lake Cumberland in McCreary County, Kentucky, near the town of Burnside. It is the third largest tributary of the Cumberland River, and is free flowing for a distance of approximately before being affected by the headwaters of the lake. The terrain furthest upstream near the confluence is the most rugged, with reliefs of as much as . This area is characterized by dendritic draining patterns and narrow gorges, with valleys strewn with large boulders fallen from cliffs above. Major formations include natural arches, mesas, chimneys, cracks and rock shelters. The terrain becomes less rugged as the river travels northward, with reliefs of between and . Soil in the area is divided between two groups. The first is primarily made up of Ramsey, Hartsells, Grimsley, and Gilpin soils and is located adjacent to the river gorge. The second consists of Hartsells, Lonewood, Ramsey, and Gilpin soils and is found on the nearby plateau. =Hydrology= Army Corps of Engineers, 1977 The river draws water from a drainage basin of Carboniferous rock in the Cumberland Plateau. Taken together, the Big South Fork and its tributaries drain between and , of which about 17% is covered by the associated National Recreation Area. The maximum recorded water flow on the Big South Fork was , the minimum recorded was , and the river averages a flow of . Around half of the Big South Fork's annual streamflow occurs during the months of January through March, and the lowest streamflow typically occurs during September and October. Along the river basin, water drops from an maximum original elevation of above sea level at Peter's Bridge on the Clear Fork, to where the waters meet the Cumberland. Between the confluence of the New River and Clear Fork, and Leatherwood Ford the river has an average gradient across of 20 feet per mile (fpm), and a maximum gradient of 40 fpm. Major tributaries of the Big South Fork include: *New River *Clear Fork River *North Whiteoak Creek *Pine Creek *Station Camp Creek *Parch Corn Creek *No Business Creek *Williams Creek *Troublesome Creek *Bear Creek *Roaring Paunch Creek *Rock Creek *Wolf Creek *Kogar Creek Water quality is generally good, but may be negatively affected by mine drainage, logging, poor road quality, and ground disturbances. The river contains about two times as much suspended and dissolved solids at a comparable river basin which does not have a history of mining. Both Tennessee and Kentucky have designated their respective portions of the Big South Fork as Outstanding National Resource Waters, and cleanup and reclamation efforts by a number of organizations have been made. History It is likely that the area surrounding the Big South Fork was frequented by Paleo-Indians, which continued up until early colonial times, although it is not clear that the area was permanently inhabited by prehistoric peoples. No intensive surveys of archaeological sites had been conducted as of 1977, when the Army Corps of Engineers published their comprehensive study of the area, although one study from the University of Tennessee along with one inter-agency governmental report had identified 21 total sites. A 2005 report by the National Park Service however estimated a total of 10,000 archaeological sites, evenly split between pre and post European contact. The first permanent European settlement was likely in 1769 in modern day Wayne County, Kentucky. By 1798, the Treaty of Tellico had officially expelled the native Cherokee peoples from the river basin, although the land, which was not well suited to agriculture, was mostly passed over by settlers until the founding of the ultimately failed colony of Rugby, Tennessee, by Thomas Hughes in the 1880s. =Blue Heron= Coal tipple at Blue Heron, 2009 The mining community of modern day Blue Heron, Kentucky, was established in 1937 along the banks of the Big South Fork, and operated until 1962 when it was abandoned by the Stearns Coal and Lumber Company. Retrieved on 2017-11-29 The site was later recreated in the 1980s and reopened as an outdoor museum. =National River and Recreation Area= The Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area was established by the United States Congress as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974. According to the text of the act, the purpose of the establishment was for: > conserving and interpreting an area containing unique cultural, historic, > geologic, fish and wildlife, archeologic, scenic, and recreational values, > preserving as a natural, free-flowing stream the Big South Fork of the > Cumberland River, major portions of its Clear Fork and New River stems, and > portions of their various tributaries for the benefit and enjoyment of > present and future generations, the preservation of the natural integrity of > the scenic gorges and valleys, and the development of the area‚Äôs potential > for healthful outdoor recreation. The legislation granted authority for land acquisition to the Army Corps of Engineers, and for managing the area to the United States Secretary of the Interior once established. Congress authorized final transfer of the land to the National Park Service in 1990, and the official dedication of the park occurred on August 25, 1991. Ecology Areal view of the confluence of the New River and the Clear Fork The Big South Fork and its watershed is home to a large variety of plant and animal species, and has likely been continuously vegetated since before the last glacial period, ending approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Habitats range from floodplains, to coves, as well as ravines, moist slopes, and sandstone caprock. The area is home to between 68 and 81 species of fish, 23 species of mussels, and up to 215 individual taxa of macro invertebrates. =Animal life= Fish species include Ictalurus punctatus (channel catfish), Stizostedion vitreum (walleye), Esox masquinongy (muskellunge), Morone chrysops (white bass), Ambloplites rupestris (rock bass), and Lepomis megalotis (longear sunfish). The availability of ‚Äúseeds, berries, nuts, buds, flowers, fleshy roots and twigs‚Äù encourages the presence of species such as the Bonasa umbellus (ruffed grouse), Meleagris gallopavo (turkey), Sciurus carolinensis (eastern gray squirrel). Food available in canopy vegetation supports Vireo olivaceus (red-eyed vireo), Wilsonia citrina (hooded warbler), Setophaga ruticilla (American redstart), Sorex fumeus (smoky shrew), Scalopus aquaticus (eastern mole), Neotoma floridana (eastern woodrat), and Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse). These species in turn provide food for predatory birds such as Strix varia (barred owl) and Buteo lineatus (red-shouldered hawk). During the 1990s, 14 adult female and 16 black bear cubs were reintroduced to the river basin, relocated from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As of 2013, genetic analysis estimated the bear population in the area to be at 245. =Plant life= The plant life along the river and in the surrounding basin can be divided into plateau and ravine communities consisting of mixed oak forests along with areas of mixed mesophytic vegetation. Forests of sugar maple, along with beech and yellow birch are found in low moist slopes, and Tsuga canadensis (Canadian hemlock) along with undergrowth of Rhododendron maximum grow in coves along streams. Communities of various species of pine may also be found. As the result of logging in the mid 20th century, most of the areas consists of 2nd or 3rd growth forest. Whitewater NPS map, showing the confluence (bottom right), rapids up to Leatherwood Ford, and Angel Falls downstream (northward) Whitewater rafting and kayaking occur on the Big South Fork mostly in the Spring season. Available runs range in distance from to , and vary in difficulty between classes I and IV according to the international scale of river difficulty. The most popular runs are those upstream from Leatherwood Ford, ranging from to in distance and between class I and IV in difficulty depending on put-in. The minimum water flow recommended by the National Park Service for rafting is 800 cfs, with a maximum flow of 10,000 cfs for safe rafting.

Frieden obtained a Ph.D. in Optics from The Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester. His doctoral thesis advisor was Robert E. Hopkins. Frieden is now an Emeritus Professor of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. Work on Fisher information in Physics Frieden is best known for his extensive work on Fisher information as a grounding principle for deriving and elaborating physical theory. (Examples are the Schr√∂dinger wave equation of quantum mechanics, and the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics.) Such theories take the form of differential equations or probability distribution functions. Central to Frieden's derivations is the mathematical variational principle of extreme physical information (EPI). This principle builds on the well-known idea that the observation of a \\"source\\" phenomenon is never completely accurate. That is, information is inevitably lost in transit from source to observation. Furthermore, the random errors that creep in are presumed to define the distribution function of the source phenomenon. As Frieden puts it, \\"the physics lies in the fluctuations.\\" Finally, the information loss may be shown to be an extreme value. Thus if the observed level of Fisher information in the data has value I, and the level of Fisher information that existed at the source has value J, the EPI principle states that I ‚àí J = extremum. In most situations, the extremum is a minimum, meaning that there is a tendency for any observation to faithfully match up with its source. =Applications= Frieden has used Fisher information and the EPI principle to derive most existing fundamental laws of physics, and some new and existing laws of biology, cancer growth, chemistry, and economics. Frieden argues that Fisher information, especially its loss I ‚àí J during observation, and EPI make up a general method for deriving scientific laws. =Criticism= Several reviewers doubt the physical and mathematical correctness of Frieden's ideas; see, for example, Raymond F. Streater's Lost Causes in Theoretical Physics: Physics from Fisher Information, and Cosma Shalizi's review of Physics from Fisher Information.

Booth was the son of The Hon and Very Revd Dr Robert Booth and was educated at Westminster School, where his success in the Latin play Andria gave him an inclination for the stage. He was intended for the church, and to attend Trinity College, Cambridge; but in 1698 he ran away and obtained employment in a theatrical company in Dublin, where he made his first appearance as the title character in Aphra Behn's Oroonoko. London success After two seasons in Ireland he returned to London, where Thomas Betterton, who had previously failed to help him, probably out of regard for Booth's family, now gave him all the assistance in his power. At the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre (1700‚Äì1704) he first appeared as Maximus in Valentinian, and his success was immediate. He was at the Haymarket with Betterton from 1705 to 1708, and for the next twenty years at Drury Lane. In 1713 he joint- managed the theater with Thomas Doggett, Colley Cibber, and Robert Wilks. After his death on 10 May 1733, Booth was buried in St Laurence Cowley near Uxbridge in Middlesex. His widow had a memorial to Booth placed in Westminster Abbey in 1772. Roles His greatest parts, after the title-part of Joseph Addison's Cato, which established his reputation as a tragedian, were probably Hotspur and Brutus. His King Lear was deemed worthy of comparison with David Garrick's. As the ghost in Hamlet he is said never to have had a superior. Among his other Shakespearian r√¥les were Mark Antony, Timon of Athens and Othello. He also played to perfection Lothario in Nicholas Rowe's The Fair Penitent. He also starred in Rowe's tragedies Ulysses (1705) as Telemachus and The Royal Convert (1707) as Hengist, King of Kent. In 1710 he starred as Athelwold in Aaron Hill's Elfrid. He starred as Coriolanus in the 1719 play The Invader of His Country by John Dennis. In 1724 he featured in John Gay's tragedy The Captives as Sophernes.

Born in Kotel, Bulgaria, Bozhilov attended the Higher Commercial School in Svishtov before starting work as a bookkeeper at the Bulgarian National Bank for the Kyustendil Banking Agency in 1902. Bozhilov worked for the Bulgarian National Bank for a total of 36 years and served at various times as its governor (1922-1923, 1923-1924, 1931-1932, 1934-1935, 1935-1938, 1944). In November 1938, Bozhilov became Minister of Finance in the government of Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov, a position which Bozhilov kept when Bogdan Filov became prime minister in 1940. In 1943, after Tsar Boris III died, Filov became one of Bulgaria‚Äôs three regents. Filov, a fervent ally of Nazi Germany and the most powerful of the regents, used his power to appoint Bozhilov (another pro-German) prime minister. As prime minister, Bozhilov worked closely with the Germans, virtually becoming their puppet as World War II raged. Essentially the only major issue on which he clashed with the Nazis was their demand for Bulgaria‚Äôs government to deport the country‚Äôs Jews to extermination camps, which Bozhilov refused to do. (For more information see F. B. Chary, The Bulgarian Jews and the Final Solution) In June 1944, at which time the Axis war effort was rapidly deteriorating, Bozhilov resigned as prime minister and returned to the Bulgarian National Bank, once again becoming its governor. In September 1944, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and invaded it, giving Communist partisans the opportunity to overthrow Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev and replace him with Kimon Georgiev. Bozhilov was subsequently arrested and tried by a People‚Äôs Court instituted by the Fatherland Front government. He was found guilty of war crimes and a variety of misdeeds he had committed while finance minister, sentenced to death, and executed in February 1945. The verdict was revoked in 1996 by Supreme Court.

In 1969‚Äì72, he served as the President of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.  Biography  Abram Saperstejn (later Albert Sabin) was born in Bia≈Çystok, Russian Empire (before and since 1918 in Poland), to Polish-Jewish parents, Jacob Saperstejn and Tillie Krugman. In 1921, he emigrated with his family on the SS Lapland which sailed from Antwerp, Belgium, to the Port of New York. In 1930, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and changed his name to Sabin, as well as assuming the middle name Bruce. He graduated from high school in Paterson, New Jersey. Sabin began university in a dentistry program, but was interested in virology and changed majors. He received a bachelor's degree in science in 1928 and a medical degree in 1931 from New York University. In 1983, Sabin developed calcification of the cervical spine, which caused paralysis and intense pain.Philip Boffey, Sabin, Paralyzed, Tells of Death Wish.

Special comment by Keith Olbermann on Countdown, 2009-10-07. This condition was successfully treated by surgery conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1992 when Sabin was 86. A year later, Sabin died in Washington, D.C., from heart failure. Medical career Sabin trained in internal medicine, pathology, and surgery at Bellevue Hospital in New York City from 1931‚Äì1933. In 1934, he conducted research at The Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine in England, then joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University). During this time, he developed an intense interest in research, especially in the area of infectious diseases. In 1939, he moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. During World War II, he was a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and helped develop a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis. Maintaining his association with Children's Hospital, by 1946, he had also become the head of Pediatric Research at the University of Cincinnati. At Cincinnati's Children's Hospital, Sabin supervised the fellowship of Robert M. Chanock, whom he called his \\"star scientific son.\\"Brown, Emma. \\"Robert M. Chanock, virologist who studied children's diseases, dies at 86\\", The Washington Post, August 4, 2010. Accessed August 9, 2010. Sabin went on a fact-finding trip to Cuba in 1967 to discuss with Cuban officials the possibility of establishing a collaborative relationship between the United States and Cuba through their respective national academies of sciences, in spite of the fact that the two countries did not have formal diplomatic ties. In 1969‚Äì72, he lived in Israel, serving as President of Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. After his return to the United States, he worked (1974‚Äì82) as a research professor at the Medical University of South Carolina. He later moved to Washington, D.C. area, where he was a resident scholar at the John E. Fogarty International Center on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Polio research Sabin (right) with Robert C. Gallo, M.D., circa 1985 With the menace of polio growing, Sabin and other researchers, most notably Jonas Salk in Pittsburgh and Hilary Koprowski and H. R. Cox in New York City and Philadelphia, sought a vaccine to prevent or mitigate the illness. This was complicated because there were multiple strains of the disease. In 1951, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis's typing program confirmed the existence of three main serotypes of poliovirus, since known as type 1, type 2, and type 3. Salk developed an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), a \\"dead\\" vaccine given by injection, which was released for use in 1955. It was effective in preventing most of the complications of polio, but did not prevent the initial intestinal infection. By carrying out autopsies of polio victims, Sabin was able to demonstrate that the poliovirus multiplied and attacked the intestines before it moved to the central nervous system. This also suggested that polio virus could be grown in other tissues besides embryonic brain tissue, leading to easier and cheaper methods of vaccine development. John Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Robbins would successfully grow poliovirus in laboratory cultures of non-nerve tissue in 1949, an achievement that earned them the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sabin developed an oral vaccine based on mutant strains of polio virus that seemed to stimulate antibody production but not to cause paralysis. Recipients of his live attenuated oral vaccine included himself, family, and colleagues. Sabin's first clinical trials were carried out at the Chillicothe Ohio Reformatory in late 1954. From 1956-1960, he worked with Russian colleagues to perfect the oral vaccine and prove its extraordinary effectiveness and safety. The Sabin vaccine worked in the intestines to block the poliovirus from entering the bloodstream. Between 1955 and 1961, the oral vaccine was tested on at least 100 million people in the USSR, parts of Eastern Europe, Singapore, Mexico, and the Netherlands. The first industrial production and mass use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) from Sabin strains was organized by Soviet scientist Mikhail Chumakov. This provided the critical impetus for allowing large-scale clinical trials of OPV in the United States in April 1960 on 180,000 Cincinnati school children. The mass immunization techniques that Sabin pioneered with his associates effectively eradicated polio in Cincinnati. Against considerable opposition from the March of Dimes Foundation, which supported use of Salk's relatively effective killed vaccine, Sabin prevailed on the Public Health Service to license his three strains of vaccine. While the PHS stalled, the USSR sent millions of doses of the oral vaccine to places with polio epidemics, such as Japan, and reaped the humanitarian benefit. Indeed, it was not clear to many that the vaccine was an American one, financed by U.S. dollars, as it was not widely available to ordinary Americans. Sabin's first oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), for use against type 1 polioviruses, was licensed in the US in 1961. His vaccines for type 2 and type 3 polioviruses were licensed in 1962. At first, the monovalent poliovirus vaccines were administered together by being put on a sugar cube. In 1964, a single trivalent OPV containing all three viral serotypes was approved. Sabin's oral vaccine was easier to give than the earlier vaccine developed by Salk in 1954, and its effects lasted longer. The Sabin vaccine became the predominant method of vaccination against polio in the United States for the next three decades. It broke the chain of transmission of the virus and allowed for the possibility that polio might one day be eradicated. Sabin also developed vaccines against other viral diseases, including encephalitis and dengue. In addition, he investigated possible links between viruses and some forms of cancer.  Philanthropy  Sabin refused to patent his vaccine, waiving every commercial exploitation by pharmaceutical industries, so that the low price would guarantee a more extensive spread of the treatment. From the development of his vaccine Sabin did not gain a penny, and continued to live on his salary as a professor. The Sabin Vaccine Institute was founded in 1993 to continue the work of developing and promoting vaccines. To commemorate Sabin's pioneering work, the institute annually awards the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal in recognition of work in the field of vaccinology or a complementary field. Awards and recognition Thomas M. Rivers, Charles Armstrong, John R.

He played in the Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from 1985 to 2000. Aguilera won a world championship as a member of the New York Mets in then, won a second world championship as a member of the Minnesota Twins in . He also played for the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs. In 2008, Aguilera was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame. Early life Aguilera attended Edgewood High School in West Covina, California, and played third base for their baseball team. Following graduation, he was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 37th round of the 1980 amateur draft on June 3, but did not sign and instead chose to attend Brigham Young University (BYU). After three years at BYU, in which he had made the transition from third base to pitcher, the Mets drafted him in the third round of the 1983 amateur draft on June 6. New York Mets Although he did not sign with the Mets organization until September, he was able to get into 16 games (going 5‚Äì6 with a 3.72 ERA in 104 innings) for the Little Falls Mets in the low A-ball New York‚ÄìPenn League. The following season he was promoted to the Lynchburg Mets in the high-A Carolina League where he was 8‚Äì3 with a 2.34 ERA and 101 strikeouts in 88 1/3 innings before being promoted to the Jackson Mets in the AA Texas League. In 1985, Aguilera was promoted to the AAA Tidewater Tides and was 6‚Äì4 with a 2.51 ERA in 11 starts before being promoted to the majors. Aguilera in 1986 Aguilera saw his first MLB action on June 12, pitching two innings of scoreless relief and getting the win against the Philadelphia Phillies in a game started by Ron Darling. In the middle of a fierce divisional race with the Cardinals, Aguilera was particularly effective in July, going 3‚Äì0 with a 0.89 ERA, and ended the season 10‚Äì7 as the Cardinals edged out the Mets. Aguilera posted an identical record the next year in 1986 as the number five starter for the division-winning Mets. That season, he was involved in a fight with Houston police outside a disco which resulted in the arrest of not only himself, but also teammates Bob Ojeda, Tim Teufel, and Darling, later referred to as 'Cooters-gate'. Misdemeanor charges against Aguilera were eventually dropped. In the 1986 postseason, Aguilera pitched five scoreless innings in relief against the Houston Astros in the NLCS. Despite a 12.00 ERA in the World Series, he was the pitcher of record in the Mets' dramatic Game 6 comeback victory, getting the win despite giving up the two runs which surrendered the lead to Boston in the top of the 10th inning. Injuries slowed him the next two years, as he was limited to 17 starts in 1987 and 3 starts in 1988 by an elbow injury that required surgery. With injury concerns and seven innings of one-run relief in the 1988 NLCS, the Mets decided to experiment with Aguilera as a reliever. After returning to the team in 1989, he was converted to a long reliever. Although he was unhappy in a low-leverage bullpen role and asked to be traded, Aguilera thrived in the role, going 6‚Äì6 with a 2.34 ERA, 80 strikeouts and 7 saves in 36 appearances. When Dwight Gooden was placed on the disabled list in early July 1989, the Mets began looking for a veteran starting pitcher via trade rather than promote from within into the open rotation slot with young pitchers such as Aguilera, Kevin Tapani, and David West rumored as trade bait. After the Mets lost their seventh game in a row ahead of the trade deadline, Aguilera was included in a last-minute deadline deal, along with West, Tapani, reliever Tim Drummond and a player to be named (which on October 16 became reliever Jack Savage), for Minnesota Twins ace Frank Viola. Minnesota Twins Although he got his wish and completed the season with the Twins as a starter, going 3‚Äì5 with a 3.72 ERA and 3 complete games in innings, he was shifted to the closer's role in 1990 and responded by saving 32 games for a team that went 74‚Äì88. The next year, his relief pitching was instrumental in the Twins' surprising division title, as he saved 42 games with a 2.35 ERA, a team record that would stand until Eddie Guardado broke it in 2002 with 45 saves. He went on to save three of four victories in the ALCS and the first two games of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves. In Game 3, he became the first pitcher to pinch hit in a World Series game since Don Drysdale in 1965, flying out in the top of the 12th with the bases loaded and two outs before giving up the game-winning hit in the bottom of the inning. He would also win Game 6 of the series. Aguilera became one of baseball's premier closers with the Twins from 1990‚Äì1995 and was named to three consecutive All-Star teams from 1991‚Äì1993. Boston Red Sox With the Twins well on their way to finishing 44 games behind the AL Central division winning Cleveland Indians in 1995, Aguilera was traded to the Red Sox on July 6 in exchange for minor league outfielder J. J. Johnson and pitcher Frank Rodriguez. The move was made official while the Red Sox were in Minneapolis playing the Twins and after walking down to the visitors dressing room, Aguilera was called on to convert a save opportunity in his very first appearance ‚Äì striking out former teammate Kirby Puckett to help nail down a 5‚Äì4 win. Aguilera would later state that the trade that brought him to Boston was the lowest point of his career. He had known he was likely to be traded and made clear in the weeks leading up to the trade that he was not happy about it. He was about to attain 10/5 status at the time (10 years in the majors, 5 with the same team)--a status which would have given him veto power over any trade, and he went on record saying he would exercise that veto power should he reach the milestone without being traded. All the same, he would perform well for the AL East champion Red Sox, going 2‚Äì2 with 20 saves and a 2.67 ERA in 30 relief appearances. Like a number of his teammates, Aguilera struggled in the playoffs, giving up one run on three hits with one strike out in two-thirds of an inning. Return to Minnesota A free agent following the 1995 season, Aguilera opted to return to the Twins. Minnesota skipper Tom Kelly installed Aguilera as a starting pitcher‚Äîa position he hadn't been in since starting 11 games for the team in 1989‚Äîrather than his familiar closer role. Despite early season shoulder and wrist injuries (with the latter reportedly caused by lifting his wife's suitcase the last week of spring training) forcing Aguilera to miss six weeks early in the season, the veteran battled his way to an 8‚Äì6 record with a 5.42 ERA in 19 starts, including a pair of complete games. The following season, the experiment of Aguilera as a starting pitcher had ended midway through spring training and the veteran returned to the bullpen. At age 35, he went 5‚Äì4 with 26 saves and a 3.82 ERA in 61 outings. In 1998, he recorded 38 saves (the most since saving 41 games in 1992) in 68 games for the Twins. In 1999, Aguilera had gone 3‚Äì1 with 6 saves and a 1.27 ERA in 17 games before the Twins traded the 37-year-old and pitcher Scott Downs to the Chicago Cubs for Kyle Lohse and Jason Ryan. Chicago Cubs Aguilera pitched well for the Cubs in 1999, posting a 6‚Äì3 record with 8 saves and a 3.69 ERA in 44 games as a middle reliever, set-up man, and occasionally a closer. At age 38, he entered the 2000 season, his 16th season in the big leagues, as the team's closer. Aguilera went 1‚Äì2 with 29 saves in 54 appearances, but blew eight of his save opportunities and finished with a 4.91 ERA for the last-place Cubs. Life after baseball After spending the off-season weighing the possibility of coming back for a 17th season, Aguilera officially retired on February 17, 2001. At the time of his retirement, his 318 saves trailed only Lee Smith, John Franco, Dennis Eckersley, Jeff Reardon, Randy Myers, Rollie Fingers, and John Wetteland in career saves. As of October 2017, he stands 20th on the career saves list. Aguilera was on top of the Twins / Senators franchise list for career saves with 254 until Joe Nathan surpassed him on August 10, 2011. In addition, Aguilera's save totals in 1991 (42 saves), 1992 (41), and 1998 (38) are 5th, 7th, and 10th on the franchise's top 10 season saves list (as of the end of the 2015 season). Aguilera is married to wife Sherry (m. 1988) and the couple have two children, daughter Rachel (born 1991) and son Austin (born 1996). A devout Christian, Aguilera now lives in the San Diego suburb of Rancho Santa Fe, California and dedicates his time to his family and real estate investments. He has also served as the pitching coach for the Santa Fe Christian High School baseball team from 2001 to 2005 and as the head coach from 2005 to 2007. On June 21, 2008, Rick Aguilera was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame.

Drive enclosures provide power to the drives therein and convert the data sent across their native data bus into a format usable by an external connection on the computer to which it is connected. In some cases, the conversion is as trivial as carrying a signal between different connector types. In others, it is complicated enough to require a separate embedded system to retransmit data over connector and signal of a different standard. Factory-assembled external hard disk drives, external DVD-ROM drives, and others consist of a storage device in a disk enclosure. Benefits An external hard drive enclosure that uses a 2.5-in drive and a USB connection for power and transfer Key benefits to using external disk enclosures include: *Adding additional storage space and media types to small form factor and laptop computers, as well as sealed embedded systems such as digital video recorders and video game consoles. *Adding RAID capabilities to computers that lack RAID controllers or adequate space for additional drives. *Adding more drives to any given server or workstation than their chassis can hold. *Transferring data between non-networked computers, humorously known as sneakernet. *Adding an easily removable backup source with a separate power supply from the connected computer. *Using a network-attached storage-capable enclosure over a network to share data or provide a cheap off-site backup solution. *Preventing the heat from a disk drive from increasing the heat inside an operating computer case. *Simple and cheap approach to hot swapping. *Recovering the data from a damaged computer's hard drive, particularly when it does not share the same interface with the computer used to perform the recovery. *Lower the cost of removable storage by reusing hardware designed for internal use. *In some instances, provides a hardened chassis to prevent wear and tear. Consumer enclosures In the consumer market, commonly used configurations of drive enclosures utilize magnetic hard drives or optical disc drives inside USB, FireWire, or Serial ATA enclosures. External 3.5-in floppy drives are also fairly common, following a trend to not integrate floppy drives into compact and laptop computers. Pre-built external drives are available through all major manufacturers of hard drives, as well as several third parties. These may also be referred to as a caddy ‚Äì a sheath, typically plastic or metallic, within which a hard disk drive can be placed and connected with the same type of adapters as a conventional motherboard and power supply would use. The exterior of the caddy typically has two female sockets, used for data transfer and power. Simplified circuit diagrams of harddiskdrive enclosure. Variants of caddy: * some larger caddies can support several devices at once and can feature either separate outputs to connect each device to a different computer, or a single output to connect both over the same data cable * certain caddies don't require a power supply, instead depending for power on the computer to which they are connected * some caddies have integrated fans with which to keep the drives within at a cool temperature * caddies for all major standards exist, supporting for example ATA, SCSI and SATA drives and USB, SCSI and FireWire outputs Advantages: * relatively high transfer speed; typically faster than other common portable media such as CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives, slower than drives connected using solely ATA, SCSI and SATA connectors * storage; typically larger than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives * price-to-storage ratio; typically better than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives Disadvantages: * power; most variants require a supply, unlike CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives... * size; typically larger than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives Form factors Buffalo external hard drive in a disk enclosure * Multiple drives: RAID-enabled enclosures and iSCSI enclosures commonly hold multiple drives. High-end and server-oriented chassis are often built around 3.5-in drives in hot-swappable drive caddies. * \\"5.25-inch\\" drive: (5.75 in √ó 8 in √ó 1.63 in = 146.1 mm √ó 203 mm √ó 41.4 mm) Most desktop models of drives for optical 120-mm discs (DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drives, CD or DVD burners), are designed to be mounted into a so-called \\"5.25-inch slot\\", which obtained its nickname because this slot size was initially used by drives for floppy disks in the IBM PC AT. (The original \\"5.25-inch slot\\" in the IBM PC was with 3.25 in (82.6 mm) twice as high as the one commonly used today; in fact, the PC's drive size was called \\"5.25-inch full-height\\", and the size used in the PC AT and commonly used today is \\"5.25-inch half-height\\".) * \\"3.5-inch\\" drive: (4 in √ó 5.75 in √ó 1 in = 101.6 mm √ó 146.05 mm √ó 25.4 mm) This smaller, disk-drive form factor was introduced with the Apple Macintosh series in 1984, and later adopted throughout the industry beginning widely with the IBM PS/2 series in 1987, which included drives of this size for 90-mm (\\"3.5-inch\\") floppy disks. This form factor is today used by most desktop hard drives. They usually have 10 mounting holes with American 6-32 UNC 2B threads: three on each side and four on the bottom. * \\"2.5-inch\\" drive: (2.75 in √ó 3.945 in √ó 0.374 in = 69.85 mm √ó 100.2 mm √ó 9.5 mm) This even smaller, form factor is widely used today in notebook computers and similar small-footprint devices. One commonplace feature for these drives is radically lower power consumption than is found in larger drives. This enables enclosure vendors to power the devices directly from the host device's USB or other external bus, in most cases. * \\"1.8-inch\\" drive: Found in extremely compact devices, such as certain portable media players and smaller notebooks, these devices are not standardized like their 2.5 inch cousins. A range of other form factors has emerged for mobile devices. While laptop hard drives are today generally of the 9.5 mm high variant of the \\"2.5-inch\\" drive form factor, older laptops and notebooks had hard drives that varied in height, which can make it difficult to find a well-fitting chassis. Laptop optical drives require \\"slim\\" 5.25-in enclosures, since they have approximately half the thickness of their desktop counterparts, and most models use a special 50-pin connector that differs from the 40-pin connectors used on desktop ATA drives. While they are less common now than they once were, it is also possible to purchase a drive chassis and mount that will convert a 3.5-inch hard drive into a removable hard disk that can be plugged into and removed from a mounting bracket permanently installed in a desktop PC case. The mounting bracket carries the data bus and power connections over a proprietary connector, and converts back into the drive's native data bus format and power connections inside the drive's chassis. Enterprise enclosures In enterprise storage the term refers to a larger physical chassis. The term can be used both in reference to network-attached storage (NAS) and components of a storage area network (SAN) or be used to describe a chassis directly attached to one or more servers over an external bus. Like their conventional server brethren, these devices may include a backplane, temperature sensors, cooling systems, enclosure management devices, and redundant power supplies. Connections An eSATA and Mini USB hard disk enclosure board Multiple connectors including external power on a 2.5 inch enclosure PCB of an enclosure controls the data transfer, generic mass storage device drivers are readily available on most operating systems This 2.5 inch caddy uses a single connector mini USB =Native drive interfaces= SCSI, SAS, Fibre Channel, eSATAp, and eSATA interfaces can be used to directly connect the external hard drive to an internal host adapter, without the need for any intervening controller. External variants of these native drive protocols are extremely similar to the internal protocols, but are often expanded to carry power (such as eSATAp and the SCSI Single Connector Attachment) and to use a more durable physical connector. A host adapter with external port may be necessary to connect a drive, if a computer lacks an available external port. =Direct attach serial interfaces= USB or FireWire connections are typically used to attach consumer class external hard drives to a computer. Unlike SCSI, eSATA, or SAS these require circuitry to convert the hard disk's native signal to the appropriate protocol. Parallel ATA and internal Serial ATA hard disks are frequently connected to such chassis because nearly all computers on the market today have USB or FireWire ports, and these chassis are inexpensive and easy to find. =Network protocols= iSCSI, NFS, or CIFS are all commonly used protocols that are used to allow an external hard drive to use a network to send data to a computer system. This type of external hard drive is also known as Network-attached storage or NAS. Often, such drives are embedded computers running operating systems such as Linux or VxWorks that use their NFS daemons and SAMBA to provide a networked file system. A newer technology NAS, has been applied to some disk enclosures, which allows network ability, direct connection (e.g., USB) and even RAID features.  Hard drive shucking  \\"Shucking\\" refers to the process of purchasing an external hard disk drive and removing the drive from its enclosure, in order for it to be used as an internal disk drive. This is performed because external drives are often cheaper than internal drives of the same capacity and model, and that external drives designed for continuous usage often contain hard drives designed for increased reliability. Following the hard disk drive shortages caused by the 2011 Thailand floods, data storage company Backblaze reduced its cost of acquiring hard drives by purchasing external hard drives and shucking them. According to Backblaze Chief Executive Gleb Budman, the company purchased 1,838 external drives during this period. Describing the process as \\"drive farming\\", the company noted that it was much cheaper for them to purchase 3 TB external drives and removing them from their cases manually, than it is to purchase internal drives.

It is a major tributary of the Cumberland River, and is part of the Cumberland, Ohio and Mississippi basins. The river is long, and its watershed covers in eleven counties. Monterey, Baxter, Sparta, Smithville, McMinnville, Altamont, Spencer and Gordonsville are among the towns that are at least partially drained by the river. The Caney Fork flows through two impoundments-- Center Hill Lake and Great Falls Lake-- both of which create sizeable artificial lakes. The river's basin is home to numerous protected lands and recreational areas, including five state wilderness areas, six interpretive areas, and a wildlife management area.Tennessee Division of Water Pollution Control, Caney Fork River Water Quality Management Plan Summary, October 2003, p. 1. Two state parks-- Edgar Evins State Park and Rock Island State Park-- are located along the river, and three others-- Fall Creek Falls State Park, Burgess Falls State Park and South Cumberland State Park-- are located within its basin. The river is a popular stream for canoeing and kayaking. The name \\"Caney Fork\\" comes from the dense cane breaks that grew along the river's banks when European explorers first arrived in the area.Samuel Cole Williams, Early Travels in the Tennessee Country, 1540-1800 (Watauga Press, 1928), p. 419. The river is a major drainage feature of the Cumberland Plateau and the largest tributary of the Cumberland River. Geography The Caney Fork rises in Cumberland County about west-northwest of Crossville before flowing southwest and crossing into White County. In southeastern White County it descends off the Cumberland Plateau through a deep and steep gorge known as Scott's Gulf in a remote area west of Scott Pinnacle, a locally-known mountain. Farther downstream, near the Dodson community, the stream becomes the border between White and Van Buren County. It receives the flow of the Calfkiller River and several minor tributaries. Located at the confluence of the Caney Fork, the Collins River and the Rocky River, is Great Falls Lake. This reservoir is impounded by Great Falls Dam, a project of the former Tennessee Electric Power Company, now owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). This is the only dam outside of the Tennessee River drainage system directly operated by TVA. This dam impounds a very small but very deep lake due to the depth of the gorges carved by the rivers it impounds. This area was something of a resort area in the early 20th century when such projects were uncommon, especially in the southeastern United States, but other than a few cabins, there is little evidence of this today, as the area has been largely supplanted by larger, more modern developments. The dam is named for the Great Falls of the Caney Fork, caused by the descent of the stream off of the Highland Rim to the level of the Nashville Basin. Located on the lake is Rock Island State Park, developed on the site of former woolen mills in the 19th century predating the electrical development. This area was used for a considerable number of exterior shots and stunts in the Sylvester Stallone film, The Specialist. At the foot of Great Falls Dam the water is usually slack except during periods of high discharge due to the influence of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Center Hill Dam project in DeKalb County further downstream, developed in the late 1950s. Unlike the Great Falls Dam, this project flooded several small communities and thousands of acres of land previously devoted to agriculture. It is crossed by a particularly scenic bridge on State Route 56. Along its shores is Edgar Evins State Park, named for the father of the area's former Representative, Joe L. Evins, former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Below Center Hill Dam, the stream crosses into Smith County and is bridged by Interstate 40 five times in under four miles. This downstream section is annually stocked with Rainbow, Brown, and Brook trout by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), and is considered to be one of the best trout rivers in the state. A final bridge, reconstructed in 2014, is on U.S. Route 70N near the Elmwood community. The river's mouth into the Cumberland River, which is considered to be a world class striper fishery, is almost directly opposite the Smith County seat of Carthage. A farm belonging to former Vice President Al Gore and formerly his late father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., is located along here.

A member of the Republican Party, he was appointed to continue Pete Wilson's term but lost the special election to finish it to Democratic candidate and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. He is the most recent member of the Republican Party to serve as a U.S. Senator from California. Seymour is also the most recent U.S. Senator from Southern California, as Feinstein, Alan Cranston, Barbara Boxer and Kamala Harris (who currently lives in Los Angeles) are all from the Bay Area. Life and career Born in Chicago, Seymour attended public schools in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959 and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1962. Seymour was the President of the California Association of Realtors from 1978 to 1982, and worked in the real estate business from 1962 to 1981. Seymour served Anaheim as a member of its city council from 1974 to 1978, as the 39th Mayor of Anaheim from 1978 to 1982, and as a State Senator from 1982 to 1991. In the California Senate, he voted to ban assault weapons, to outlaw discrimination against people with AIDS, and to increase spending for social programs including education and mental health benefits.New Senator from California is named, The New York Times, 1991/01/03. As Mayor of Anaheim, Seymour was instrumental in recruiting the Los Angeles Rams to move to Anaheim Stadium. In 1991, Seymour was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Pete Wilson to serve in the seat Wilson had vacated to become governor. Seymour's appointment lasted until the 1992 special election to select a replacement who would serve until the normal expiration of Wilson's term in 1995. Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein defeated Seymour in the special election. After his Senate term, Seymour served as director of the California Housing Finance Agency for two years, and later served as CEO of the nonprofit Southern California Housing Development Corporation and on the boards of directors of several housing-related companies including IndyMac Bank, Orange Coast Title Insurance, Los Angeles Federal Savings Bank, and Irvine Apartment Communities. Seymour currently lives in San Marcos, California.

Factor is dynamically typed and has automatic memory management, as well as powerful metaprogramming features. The language has a single implementation featuring a self-hosted optimizing compiler and an interactive development environment. The Factor distribution includes a large standard library. History Slava Pestov created Factor in 2003 as a scripting language for a video game. The initial implementation, now referred to as JFactor, was implemented in Java and ran on the Java Virtual Machine. Though the early language resembled modern Factor superficially in terms of syntax, the modern language is very different in practical terms and the current implementation is much faster. The language has changed significantly over time. Originally, Factor programs centered on manipulating Java objects with Java's reflection capabilities. From the beginning, the design philosophy has been to modify the language to suit programs written in it. As the Factor implementation and standard libraries grew more detailed, the need for certain language features became clear, and they were added. JFactor did not have an object system where you could define your own classes, and early versions of native Factor were the same; the language was similar to Scheme in this way. Today, the object system is a central part of Factor. Other important language features such as tuple classes, combinator inlining, macros, user-defined parsing words and the modern vocabulary system were only added in a piecemeal fashion as their utility became clear. The foreign function interface was present from very early versions to Factor, and an analogous system existed in JFactor. This was chosen over creating a plugin to the C part of the implementation for each external library that Factor should communicate with, and has the benefit of being more declarative, faster to compile and easier to write. The Java implementation initially consisted of just an interpreter, but a compiler to Java bytecode was later added. This compiler only worked on certain procedures. The Java version of Factor was replaced by a version written in C and Factor. Initially, this consisted of just an interpreter, but the interpreter was replaced by two compilers, used in different situations. Over time, the Factor implementation has grown significantly faster. Description Factor is a dynamically typed, functional and object-oriented programming language. Code is structured around small procedures, called words. In typical code, these are 1‚Äì3 lines long, and a procedure more than 7 lines long is very rare. Something that would idiomatically be expressed with one procedure in another programming language would be written as several words in Factor. Each word takes a fixed number of arguments and has a fixed number of return values. Arguments to words are passed on a data stack, using reverse Polish notation. The stack is used just to organize calls to words, and not as a datastructure. The stack in Factor is used in a similar way to the stack in Forth; for this, they are both considered stack languages. For example, below is a snippet of code that prints out \\"hello world\\" to the current output stream: \\"hello world\\" print \`print\` is a word in the \`io\` vocabulary that takes a string from the stack and returns nothing. It prints the string to the current output stream (by default, the terminal or the graphical listener). Not all data has to be passed around only with the stack. Lexically scoped local variables let you store and access temporaries used within a procedure. Dynamically scoped variables are used to pass things between procedure calls without using the stack. For example, the current input and output streams are stored in dynamically scoped variables. Factor emphasizes flexibility and the ability to extend the language. There is a system for macros, as well as for arbitrary extension of Factor syntax. Factor's syntax is often extended to allow for new types of word definitions and new types of literals for data structures. It is also used in the XML library to provide literal syntax for generating XML. For example, the following word takes a string and produces an XML document object which is an HTML document emphasizing the string: : make-html ( string -- xml ) dup # <-> XML> ; The word \`dup\` duplicates the top item on the stack. The \`<->\` stands for filling in that part of the XML document with an item from the stack. Implementation and libraries Factor includes a large standard library, written entirely in the language. These include * A cross-platform GUI toolkit, built on top of OpenGL and various windowing systems, used for the development environment. * Bindings to several database libraries, including PostgreSQL and SQLite. * An HTTP server and client, with the Furnace web framework. * Efficient homogeneous arrays of integers, floats and C structs. * A library implementing regular expressions, generating machine code to do the matching. A foreign function interface is built into Factor, allowing for communication with C, Objective-C and Fortran programs. There is also support for executing and communicating with shaders written in GLSL. Factor is implemented in Factor and C++. It was originally bootstrapped from an earlier Java implementation. Today, the parser and the optimizing compiler are written in the language. Certain basic parts of the language are implemented in C++ such as the garbage collector and certain primitives. Factor uses an image- based model, analogous to many Smalltalk implementations, where compiled code and data are stored in an image. To compile a program, the program is loaded into an image and the image is saved. A special tool assists in the process of creating a minimal image to run a particular program, packaging the result into something that can be deployed as a standalone application. The Factor compiler implements many advanced optimizations and has been used as a target for research in new optimization techniques.

Life He was probably born in Suffolk when the surname was common. If his own statement of his age may be trusted, he was born about 1474. He was educated at Oxford and travelled in England, Scotland and France. On his return his various accomplishments, especially his most excellent vein in poetry, procured him a place at court. He was Groom of the Chamber to Henry VII as early as 1502. According to Anthony Wood, he could repeat by heart the works of most of the English poets, especially the poems of John Lydgate, whom he called his master.A. √† Wood (ed. P. Bliss), Athenae Oxonienses, with the Fasti, 3 vols (F.C. & J. Rivington, etc., London 1813-), I, pp. 9-11 (Google). He was still living in 1521, when it is stated in Henry VIII's household accounts that ¬£6, 13s. 4d. was paid to Mr Hawes for his play; he died before 1530, when Thomas Field, in his Conversation between a Lover and a Jay, wrote \\"Yong Steven Hawse, whose soule God pardon, Treated of love so clerkly and well\\". Some critics, notably C.S. Lewis, have treated Hawes dismissively: \\"faculty was what he lacked; there was more and better poetry in him than he could express\\", referring to his \\"broken-backed metre and dull excursions into the seven liberal arts\\".C.S. Lewis, English Literature in the Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama (Oxford University Press, 1944). But his metre is not consistently broken-backed: from time to time (though not very often) one encounters lines that would not have disgraced either Chaucer before him or Spenser after him: \\"The fragraunt fumes / dyde well encense out // All mysty vapours / of perturbacyon // ore lyker was / her habytacyon // Vnto a place / whiche is celestyall // Than to a terrayne / mancyon fatall\\" or \\" By her propre hande / soft as ony sylke // With due obeysaunce / I dyde her than take // Her skynne was whyte / as whalles bone or mylke // My thoughtes was rauysshed / I myght not aslake // My brennynge hert / she the fyre dyde make // These daunces truely / musyke hath me tought // To lute or daunce / but it auayled nought\\" and so on, where, so long as one pronounces at least some of the final 'e's, the metre seems to work quite well. Novelist Hilda Lamb made Hawes a character of her novel \\"The Willing Heart\\" published in 1958, where he is fictionally portrayed as an illegitimate son of King Richard III's.Lamb, Hilda The Willing Heart, (Hodder & Stoughton 1958). No contemporary documents support this assumption. Works His major work is The History of Graunde Amour and la Bel Pucel, conteining the knowledge of the Seven Sciences and the Course of Mans Life in this Worlde or The Passetyme of Pleasure, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509, but finished three years earlier. It was also printed with slightly varying titles by the same printer in 1517, by J. Wayland in 1554, by Richard Tottel and by John Waley in 1555. Tottel's edition was edited by T. Wright and reprinted by the Percy Society in 1846. The Passetyme of Pleasure is a long allegorical poem in seven-lined stanzas of man's life in this world. It is divided into sections after the manner of Le Morte d'Arthur and borrows the machinery of romance. Its main motive is the education of the knight, Graunde Amour, based, according to William John Courthope (History of English Poetry, vol. I. 382), on the Marriage of Mercury and Philology, by Martianus Capella, and the details of the description prove Hawes to have been acquainted with medieval systems of philosophy. At the suggestion of Fame, and accompanied by her two greyhounds, Grace and Governance, Graunde Amour starts out in quest of La Bel Pucel. He first visits the Tower of Doctrine or Science where he acquaints himself with the arts of grammar, logic, rhetoric and arithmetic. After a long disputation with the lady in the Tower of Music he returns to his studies, and after sojourns at the Tower of Geometry, the Tower of Doctrine, the Castle of Chivalry, etc., he arrives at the Castle of La Bel Pucel, where he is met by Peace, Mercy, Justice, Reason and Memory. His happy marriage does not end the story, which goes on to tell of the oncoming of Age, with the concomitant evils of Avarice and Cunning. The admonition of Death brings Contrition and Conscience, and it is only when Remembraunce has delivered an epitaph chiefly dealing with the Seven Deadly Sins, and Fame has enrolled Graunde Amours name with the knights of antiquity, that we are allowed to part with the hero. This long imaginative poem was widely read and esteemed, and certainly exercised an influence on the genius of Edmund Spenser. Hawes' poetry sought to revive the earlier medieval romances and allegorical poems which he much admired. Other works of Hawes include The Conversyon of Swerers (1509) and A Joyfidi Medytenon to all Englonde, a coronation poem (1509).

The community, once the county seat of Calhoun County, is a part of the Victoria, Texas, Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 1875, the city had a population of 5,000, but on September 15 of that year, a powerful hurricane struck, killing between 150 and 300 and almost entirely destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, only to be wiped out on August 19, 1886, by another intense hurricane, which was followed by a fire. Indianola was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1963, marker number 2642.  History  = German immigration port of entry = Prince Carl of Solms- Braunfels, representing the Adelsverein, selected Indian Point in December, 1844 as port of entry for the Verein colonists from Germany. Prince Solms renamed the port Carlshafen in honor of himself, Count Carl of Castell-Castell and Count Victor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen whom Solms claimed had been christened Carl. Prince Solms' choice of Carlshafen and its inadequate accommodations as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans.King (1967) pp.52-58 In February 1845 Henry Francis Fisher conspired with Dr. F. Schubbert to coerce incoming immigrants to sign legal documents disassociating themselves from the Verein and to join Schubbert's colony in Milam County.Solms (2000) p.131 In May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 colonists were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants were stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach's requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings at pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established an inadequate $60,000 letter of credit.King (1967) pp.75-83 Meusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the United States hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.King (1967) pp.85,87 An epidemic of spinal meningitis broke out at Carlshafen and spread with the emigrants to New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.King (1967) p.88 Samuel Addition White and William M. Cook founded Indian Point, later Indianola, in August, 1846. Some of these immigrants purchased land from Samuel White and established a settlement at Indian Point. The name of the settlement changed to Indianola in 1849 by combining the word Indian with ola, the Spanish word for \\"wave\\". The German immigrants continued to refer to the community as Carlshaven (Carl's Harbor) in honor of Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels. = Post German immigration years = Indianola, Texas in 1875 From its founding in 1846, Indianola served as a major port, and before the 1875 storm was second only to Galveston, Texas as Texas' primary port. The town incorporated in 1853. In 1856, the port received cargoes of camels, part of the United States Camel Corps experiment to replace horses and mules as the primary pack animal in the southwestern parts of the country. During the American Civil War, Indianola was twice occupied by Union troops, in October 1862 and November 1863. During the second occupation, part of a Union infantry regiment moving from Indianola to Matagorda Island drowned in Matagorda Bay. In 1869, the world's first mechanically-refrigerated shipment of beef left Indianola for New Orleans. During World War II, the United States Army constructed an anti-aircraft firing range along the Indianola shoreline to train gunners and the facility was used primarily by military personnel from Camp Hulen, located outside of Palacios. = Impact of storms = Having survived severe storms before, Indianola was almost totally destroyed on 16 September 1875. The New York Times reported in detail on the extensive loss of life and property. Even the lighthouses were swept away and the keepers, including Thomas H. Mayne and Edward Flick Jr. of the East Shoal Lighthouse, killed. The town was rebuilt, but events were repeated in 1886. The destruction served as an abject lesson for many residents of Galveston, 100 miles up the Texas coast. However, their calls for a seawall to protect that city went unheeded, and Galveston nearly shared Indianola's fate when the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 struck the island. A railroad was intended to connect the port of Indianola to San Antonio. After the two storms, discouraged investors abandoned the venture and made Galveston the port of choice. After Galveston's hurricane, shipping traffic recentered over time to inland Houston. After the 1886 storm, the county seat was moved to Port Lavaca. On October 4, 1887, the post office in Indianola was permanently closed and the town declared \\"dead\\". Today, almost nothing remains of the original Indianola, as, due to storm erosion, most of the site of the city is now under water. A granite marker was placed on the shore at the nearest point to the Indianola courthouse, now 300 feet (about 90 meters) away in Matagorda Bay. It reads, \\"Calhoun County Courthouse. Edward Beaumont, Architect 1859. During the Storms of 1875 and 1886, precious lives were saved within its walls of shell, concrete, and lime. Abandoned 1886.\\" The site is also home to a statue of Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. Indianola is now the site of a small unincorporated fishing village.  Popular culture  = In literature = In Elizabeth Hand's novel Aestival Tide, a reconstructed Indianola is featured as the lowermost level of the central ziggurat in the dome city of Araboth. In the novel Matagorda by author Louis L'Amour, much of the action took place in Indianola, Texas on the day it was destroyed by the 1875 hurricane. The courthouse, the site of which is now underwater out in the bay, was featured as the last refuge of the townspeople. In Part I of Isaac's Storm, in the chapter \\"Galveston: An Absurd Delusion\\" (pages 79‚Äì84), Erik Larson describes the two storms that ravaged Indianola and the significance of these storms for Galveston, leading up to the Galveston storm of 1900. He notes: \\"At first, Galveston's leading men seemed to grasp the significance of the Indianola storms. Anyone who looked at a map could see that Galveston was even more vulnerable to destruction than Indianola. It had no picket of barrier islands to shelter it, no buffer of mainland prairie. The city faced the Gulf head-on.\\" He further observes: \\"Six weeks after the second Indianola storm, a group of thirty prominent Galveston residents calling themselves the Progressive Association met and resolved to build a seawall\\", and \\"The city's Evening Tribune endorsed the plan\\". However, although \\"The state eventually did authorize a bond to pay for the work,\\" the city's engineer E.M. Hartwick observed, \\"this was some months after the flood, and by then the attitude was, Oh, we'll never get another one--and they didn't build.\\" Larson criticizes meteorologist Isaac Cline (among others) for this failure. For example, Larson cites statements Cline published in the July 1891 Galveston News article, \\"West India Hurricanes\\": Further, in Part III of Isaac's Storm, in a chapter titled \\"Ritter's Cafe: You Can't Frighten Me\\", Larson publishes the recollections of Mollie Cohen, whose impressions of the Galveston Storm of 1900 reminded her of the second Indianola hurricane: = In music = Singer/songwriter, Charlie Robison, included a song titled \\"Indianola\\" on the 1998 album Life of the Party that is a specific reference to Indianola, Texas. The song begins from the perspective of a German immigrant approaching Indianola by sea and chronicling details of the narrator's family. The narrator and his cousin attempt to traverse the South to join the Union Army in the American Civil War, though they encounter Rebel resistance in Indianola, TX. The next scene of the folk song briefly addresses the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in an indirect fashion, noting that little change occurred in their respective lives other than rust's accumulating on wagon wheels. While this verse is brief in regards to words and time, it denotes a subtle and increasing disaffection in the American/Texan experience, adversely affected by seemingly non-relevant incidences. The storyline then progresses to World War II, introducing an internal struggle between the call of duty of the United States of America and its armed conflict with Germany, the ancestral point of origin of many Americans. The overall sentiment of the song begins as a story of new promises followed by a series of fictional, though personally carved facts, that illustrate a common experience for the individualist. Texas exemplifies a spirit that is not only uniquely a Texan story, but an American one, thrusting the individual against the external influence that would assume its right to assert its own values. This, however, should not be confused with contemporary movements deviating from the spirit of this song. Singer/songwriter Brian Burns included the song \\"Indianola\\" on his 2004 album \\"Heavy Weather\\". The lyrics of the song chronicle the full life cycle of Indianola with verses from the points of view of a personified Matagorda bay, an immigrant who helped build the city (Johann), a worker who came to help \\"bury the lost souls who perished that day\\" (Isaac), and finally the songwriter himself visiting the site (Brian). It is unclear whether the \\"Johann\\" mentioned in verse three refers to the Johann Dethardt, the first ship to bring settlers into the area, or Johann Swartz, the owner/builder of the first home erected in what would become Indianola.

It was phased out of U.S. military service in 2001, in favor of the newer FGM-148 Javelin system. The M47 Dragon uses a wire-guidance system in concert with a high explosive anti-tank warhead and was capable of defeating armored vehicles, fortified bunkers, main battle tanks, and other hardened targets. While it was primarily created to defeat the Soviet Union's T-55, T-62, and T-72 tanks, it saw use well into the 1990s, seeing action in the Persian Gulf War. The U.S. military officially retired the weapon in 2001. The United States destroyed the last of its stocks of the missile in 2009. https://www.army.mil/article/27423/admc_destroys_armys_last_dragon_missiles The weapon system remains in active service with other militaries around the world. History A U.S. Army soldier firing M47 Dragon U.S. Army soldiers armed with the M47 Dragon during the 1983 Invasion of Grenada Used by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, as well as many foreign militaries, the M47 Dragon was first fielded in January 1975 to U.S. Army soldiers stationed in mainland Europe. The effective range of the Dragon was about , with the missile traveling per second, guided by an infrared sight. The operator had to continue to track the missile to its target, which exposed him to enemy fire. Design The first oddity for using the Dragon was the delay between snapping the trigger and the ignition of the launch motor. This was due to a chemical battery charging the initiator circuit (the operator could hear a rising whine similar to the whine made by early integrated flash cameras when charging the flash circuit). This usually led to the operator tensing up in anticipation of the sudden explosion from the launcher that he knew was coming. The missile was discharged from the launcher tube by a \\"launch motor\\", which was a rocket motor that completely expended itself within the tube so as not to injure the operator with exhaust gas. The missile coasted away from the operator and a burning infrared flare was ignited at the rear of the missile. After the missile was about from the gunner, the missile was propelled forward and guided towards the target by three rows of thrusters aligned longitudinally along the missile body. The rocket spiralled as it moved forward, and the thrusters were fired in pairs to move the missile forward as well as keep the missile on target. These were activated by the sight controller which sent signals from the sight mechanism to the missile along the wire which spooled out behind the missile and remained connected to the sight. The operator kept the sight crosshairs on the target; the sight tracked the infrared flare and sent corrections to the missile service motor to bring the flight of the missile to the aim point. The service charges were fired as needed both to keep the missile correcting toward the aim point and to keep it up and moving forward. A missile moving towards a stationary target and tracked by a steady gunner would fire the thrusters about every .5 to 1 second, resulting in its signature 'popping' sound as it moved downrange. If the operator over-corrected his aim point beyond the service motor's capability to keep up, the missile grounded itself. Conversely, if the guidance wire broke, the missile would fire its rockets rapidly, sending the missile into a rapid ascent. This was a recoilless weapon‚Äîthe launcher did not \\"kick\\" per se when fired‚Äîbut the sudden loss of the missile weight from the shoulder caused many soldiers to flinch badly enough to lose track of the target, resulting in a missile grounding. The M47 Dragon was not particularly popular with U.S. soldiers. Because of the missile's relatively short range and signature 'popping' sound as the missile was propelled towards the target, M47 Dragon crews were expected to take heavy casualties in the event hostilities broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe. Variants =Dragon II= Designed and upgraded from Dragon in 1985 when its penetration effectiveness was increased. =Super-Dragon= Upgraded from Dragon II in 1990, it was capable of penetrating of armor at a maximum effective range of . =Saeghe= Iran has reverse-engineered a version of the Dragon, the Saeghe. They displayed it in 2002 at the Defendory exhibition in Athens, when it was in mass production. Hezbollah has acquired Saeghes for anti-tank and anti-armor uses. Known versions include Saeghe-1 and Saeghe-2. Components The launcher system of the M47 Dragon consists of a smoothbore fiberglass tube, breech/gas generator, tracker, bipod, battery, sling, and forward and aft shock absorbers. In order to fire the weapon, non-integrated day or night sights must be attached. While the launcher itself is expendable, the sights can be removed and reused.

Robert's love for his kids, combined with his vivid imagination (prompting frequent fantasy sequences) and impulsive energy, propels him to do extraordinary things on their behalf as he continually dreams up nontraditional solutions to traditional family problems. Many critics from news organizations such as the Associated Press and The Atlanta Journal- Constitution often referred to the show as The Cosby Show of the 1990s. =Cast changes= Throughout its 5-season run, each season brought cast changes, some unexplained. Carol Woods, who played Mrs. Wilcox, the housekeeper and Wendell's mother, left the series after the first season, along with Bobby McGee, who played one of Robert's childhood friends. Faizon Love, a recurring character in season one, became a regular in season two. At the end of the third season, Kenny Blank, who played Michael Peterson, left the series; at the beginning of the next season his character was explained to be off at college. Blank's departure also saw the exits of Nigel Thatch, who had played Zaria's militant but loveable boyfriend Shakeim, and Tasha Scott, who was Zaria's friend and the lead singer in Michael's band. Season three ended with an unexplained cliffhanger, with Shakeim starting Morehouse College early-admission and Skye (Shyheim), another member of Michael's band, confessing his feelings for Zaria. Shakeim decides to stay and attend NYU in the fall instead; as Zaria and Skye discuss it, Shakeim walks into the room and Zaria runs upstairs. Tyrone Dorzell Burton was introduced as streetwise kid T.K. in the season-four premiere, which focused on him and his situation. Hollywood Insider reported that WB was cancelling the series in May 1998, leaving another cliffhanger, but the network gave the series a last-minute 13-episode renewal for midseason. Faizon Love left at that time and Kelly Perine was brought on as Robert's brother Kelly. =The later seasons= The show took a different turn at the beginning of the 1997-1998 season: Michael (Blank) was written out of the series with his absence explained as him going off to college, and a troubled teenager from juvenile hall, T.K., joined the household. T.K.'s father (Richard Lawson) was an ex-convict, and his mother (Bern Nadette Stanis) was a drug addict who literally left him on the street. Jerri was the only person who didn't give up on T.K. and welcomed him into her home, even though Robert did not think it was a good idea. During this season, more teenage storylines were employed including domestic abuse, peer pressure and Robert reaching out to many of T.K.'s street friends trying to help them change their lives; one character, \\"Boo\\" (played by the rapper Da Brat), gets her high-school diploma thanks to Robert and T.K. In the 1997-98 fourth-season finale, T.K. gets into a fight with several thugs (including Tyrese Gibson), and Robert tries to talk him out the situation. Robert and T.K. leave and the thugs fire a gun, ending the episode on a cliffhanger. The show's final season was placed on hiatus after this episode and didn't return until May 30, 1999, a year after the season finale aired. In the fifth season's first episodes, Jerri has finally had enough of T.K. due to the shooting, but before he moves out of the house, he and family check on Robert, who has fallen into a coma; in the coma, Robert meets guardian angel Max (Barry Sobel), who convinces Robert to change his mind about the shooting and T.K; when Robert awakens, all is forgiven. In later episodes, T.K. tries to get his act together and sees his mom again; he decides he wants to move back in with her, but she relapses back into substance abuse and the Petersons tell T.K. their home is always open to him. In the last episode, which was not produced or written as the last episode, Jerri and Robert renew their wedding vows and the cast dances a Soul Train line into the final commercial break.

He was the first to use mass spectrometry to isolate uranium-235 which was used to demonstrate that 235U could undergo fission and developed the sector mass spectrometer configuration now known as Nier-Johnson geometry. Early career He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota on May 28, 1911. Nier showed an early ability in mathematics and science, coupled with an aptitude for craft and mechanical work. Nier's German immigrant parents had little education or financial resources but their determination for his development meant that he was able to attend the nearby University of Minnesota. Though he graduated in electrical engineering in 1931, the lack of engineering jobs during the Great Depression encouraged him to take up graduate study in physics. Harvard In 1936, his spectroscopic skills won him a fellowship and substantial grant at Harvard University.Reynolds (1998) His work there led to the 1938 publication of measurements of the relative abundance of the isotopes of uranium, measurements that were used by Fritz Houtermans and Arthur Holmes in the 1940s to estimate the age of the Earth. The Manhattan Project Nier returned to Minnesota in 1938 to be near his ageing parents. In 1940, on the request of Enrico Fermi, he and a few students, including Edward Ney, prepared a pure sample of uranium-235 using an early mass spectrograph designed by Nier, for John R. Dunning's team at Columbia University. On the day of its receipt (it was sent by US Postal Mail), Dunning's team was able to demonstrate that uranium-235 was the isotope responsible for nuclear fission, rather than the more abundant uranium-238. Confirmation of this suspected fact was a critical step in the development of the atomic bomb. From 1943 to 1945, Nier worked with Kellex Corporation in Manhattan, New York City on the design and development of efficient and effective mass spectrographs for use in the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb in World War II. During the war most of the spectrographs used for monitoring uranium separations were designed by Nier.Arblaster Later work After the war, he returned to Minnesota where he worked on geochronology, the upper atmosphere, space science and noble gases. Nier designed the miniature mass spectrometers used by the Viking Landers to sample the atmosphere of Mars. Death Active to the end of his life, he died on May 16, 1994, two weeks after being paralysed in a motor accident. Honors Nier was a member, National Academy of Sciences;Mauersberger (1999) and a foreign scientific member of the Max Planck Society. The Martian crater Nier and the mineral nierite (tiny silicon nitride inclusions in meteorites) were named after him. The Nier Prize is awarded annually by the Meteoritical Society and recognizes outstanding research in meteoritics and closely allied fields by young scientists.

They are notable for legal issues based on the violation of intellectual property rights held by Nintendo and its various game licensees. Manufactured by NrTrade, the Power Player line has been sold in North America, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Hardware Power Player Super Joy III System The system resembles a Nintendo 64 controller and attaches to a TV set. NTSC, PAL and SECAM versions are available. They all use a custom \\"NES-on-a-chip\\" (NOAC) that is an implementation of the NES's hardware such as its custom 6502, PPU, and PAPU. The units resemble a Nintendo 64 controller, sometimes with a cartridge slot for Famicom games. They come packaged with a secondary 9-pin 6 button controller resembling a Sega Genesis controller, intended for a second player. They are packaged with a 9-pin light gun resembling a Walther PPK pistol. There is a non-moving joystick, added for visual appeal. Though the Power Player Super Joy's button layout is identical to that of the Nintendo 64 controller, the buttons have been mapped differently. The C buttons of the Nintendo 64's controller function as A and B on the Super Joy, the A and B buttons of the Nintendo 64's controller are Start and Select on the Super Joy, respectively. Finally, the N64 controller's Start button is the Reset button on the Super Joy. The units are available in multiple colors, including black, grey, red, and blue. The consoles have 76 built-in games, although marketing frequently claims to have more than 1,000 ways of playing them. Hence, the game count of 76,000 is listed as a gold sticker on the box. Most of the included games had been originally released for the NES or Famicom, but some have been created by the manufacturer. Most of the games have had their title screen graphics removed to save space on the ROM chip. There are a number of scenes depicted on the front and back of the boxes, but all of them are artistic stylized drawings or retouched photos‚Äînone of them are actual game screenshots. Some versions sold in the US have an unlicensed still image from Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace on the front of the box. After this product gained some popularity, the Power Player 3.5, an improved model with more games, was released. A wireless version of Power Games was also released.

Hodgkinson FRS (26 February 1789 ‚Äì 18 June 1861) was an English engineer, a pioneer of the application of mathematics to problems of structural design. Early life Hodgkinson was born in the village of Anderton, near Northwich, Cheshire, to a farming family. His father died when he was six years old, and he was raised with his two sisters by his mother, who maintained the farming business. She sent her son to Witton Grammar School in Northwich where he studied the classics with the intention that he would fulfill the family's ambition that he prepare for a career in the Church of England. Unfortunately, the regime was unsuited to his tastes and talents which were already showing promise in mathematics. His mother moved him to a less prestigious private school in Northwich where his enthusiasm for mathematics was encouraged and fostered but, as the young Hodgkinson grew physically, he became indispensable on the family farm and soon left education to devote himself there. However, farming was no more to his taste than Greek and Latin and his mother yearned to satisfy her son's appetites. Family friends advised that Hodgkinson might find some more suitable outlet in nearby Manchester and so, in 1811, the family left for Salford to open a pawnbroking business. Hodgkinson used all his spare time in reading science and mathematics and soon introduced himself into Manchester's scientific community, meeting, among others, his future collaborator, Sir William Fairbairn. He became a pupil of John Dalton, studying mathematics, and the two remained firm friends until Dalton's death in 1844. He retired early from the family business to devote a modest pension to his scientific work. He married twice, to Catherine Johns and to a Miss Holditch. There were no children. Scientific work Hodgkinson experimented on the strength of columns, here showing the failure mode Hodgkinson measured the strength of columns of materials including cast iron and marble in a series of experiments.Henry Moseley. Illustrations of Mechanics. Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans, Paternoster-Row. 1839. Page 403. Hodgkinson worked with Sir William Fairbairn in Manchester on the design of iron beams, especially on the Water Street bridge for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1828‚Äì30. His improved cross section was published by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1830 and influenced much nineteenth century structural engineering. He derived the empirical formula for a concentrated load, W (in tons), at which a beam will fail as a function of its length between simple supports, L (in inches); its depth, d (in inches); and its bottom-flange area, A (inch¬≤): :W=\\\\frac {26Ad} {L} Britannia Bridge, showing the unused holes for the suspension chains that were never needed. His expertise with beams led to his retention, along with Fairbairn, as consultant on the novel tubular design for the Britannia Bridge. Fairbairn built and tested several prototypes, and developed the final form adopted for the bridge. Both Hodgkinson and Robert Stephenson believed that extra chains would be needed to support the heavy spans, so the towers were built with spaces for the chains. Fairbairn, however, insisted that chains would not be necessary, and his opinion prevailed. He was right, and chains were never used, but the towers remain with their empty recesses. Later years Hodgkinson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1841 and, in 1847, he became professor of the mechanical principles of engineering at University College London. In 1849, he was appointed by the UK Parliament to participate in a Royal Commission to investigate the application of iron in railroad structures, performing some early investigations of metal fatigue. Towards the end of his life, his mental faculties failed and he died at Higher Broughton, Salford.

Growing up as an only child in Fort Wayne, Barr made her acting debut at the age of 13 in a production of Peter Pan. This helped her decide to pursue acting as a career, and by the time she graduated from college at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, she had performed in 25 professional productions. She spent two years at the Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, New York. Career Julia Barr broke into soap operas with a short stint as bad girl Reenie Szabo on Ryan's Hope. She was soon invited to join the cast of All My Children as Brooke English, succeeding Elissa Leeds in the role. Her portrayal of Brooke has garnered Barr eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations (1980, 1981, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1998 and 2001), winning the award in 1990 and again in 1998 for 'Outstanding Supporting Actress'.

Barr was at one time a vocalist in a band that she formed with Richard Shoberg, who played her onscreen husband Tom Cudahy. Barr once played Erica Kane in an audition scene with David Canary. Barr took a 15-month break from the show beginning in 1981, during which time she toured with Katharine Hepburn and Dorothy Loudon in the national touring company of West Side Waltz. She returned to the show in 1982. Despite fan outcry, Barr's airtime on AMC diminished in the early 2000s with her character Brooke only being used to further other characters story lines. In late 2006, executives at ABC did not renew Barr's contract, and offered her recurring status (without a guarantee of appearances). Barr declined. Fans of the show, and particularly Barr, were upset that she was leaving. Barr's contract officially expired in December 2006 and her last regular episode aired on December 20 after which, the character simply vanished due to the writers not crafting a proper exit for her character, which further fueled fan outrage.http://www.amcpages.com/amc/news/2006/1030-barr.php In 2007 Barr teamed up with All My Children co-star Jill Larson to produce and write a web series titled The Vindicated, which about three women, who are at a point in their lives in which they are without their male counterparts for different reasons.<>.

He was a member of the Young Poland movement. Life Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer was born in Lud≈∫mierz in Podhale near the Tatra Mountains, then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire now in Poland, and died in Warsaw. His older half-brother was the painter W≈Çodzimierz Tetmajer. Przerwa-Tetmajer studied classics and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in 1884‚Äì1889. He then became a journalist at Kurier Polski, and lived both in the Tatras and in Krak√≥w (Cracow). After World War I he moved to Warsaw to serve as president of the Society of Writers and Journalists. In 1934 he was made honorary member of the Polish Academy of Literature. Przerwa-Tetmajer suffered from a mental illness in the latter years of his life, which prevented him from writing. He was living in a hospice in 1940 when the German occupants evicted all the patients. He was left homeless and died shortly afterwards in a Warsaw hospital. Work Przerwa-Tetmajer wrote seven collections of poetry before World War I. He is particularly well known for his works about the Tatra mountains. At least one of his poems, Kriv√°≈à, High Kriv√°≈à! (Krywaniu, Krywaniu wysoki!) is now often taken for an authentic folk song and was credited as such on a similarly named 1972 folk-rock album by Skaldowie. According to Barry Keane from The Warsaw Voice: > Przerwa Tetmajer was primarily a lyrical poet who articulated the birth > pangs of modernism at the turn of the century, but he will be best > remembered for his erotic verse and for poems evoking his beloved Tatra > mountains. He broke with age-old subtleties and niceties common to amorous > poetry and wrote on love in frank and provocative terms. The poet > simultaneously attracted huge praise from legions of readers and loud > accusations of depravity from other quarters... at the close of the 19th > century. His work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. References See also * About K.

The games are known for their bright colors, upbeat songs, and cute cartoon character graphics. Originally released in 1998, the series has had over fifteen home releases in Japan as well as many arcade versions. Gameplay Photograph of a homemade Pop'n Music controller. Photograph of an official Konami Pop'n Music mini-controller. Unlike most of Konami's Bemani series, the Pop'n Music interface is not designed to represent any actual musical instrument. Instead, it uses nine buttons, each three-and-a-half-inches in diameter, laid out in two rows (Since the location test of Wonderland, a multitouch panel is added). Five buttons are the bottom row, the other four being the top. Like in most Bemani games, color-coded notes (in this game called \\"Pop-kun\\" („Éù„ÉÉ„ÉóÂêõ) and anthropomorphized with faces) fall from the top of the screen in nine columns that correspond to the buttons. When a note reaches the red line at the bottom of the screen, the player presses the button or tap the panel, which triggers a sound within the song. When a note is played, an accuracy rating is displayed, either \\"Great\\", \\"Good\\", or \\"Bad\\". The maximum number of points possible in any single-stage song is 100,000, and unlike beatmania or beatmania IIDX, can not be exceeded as no additional score bonuses are given. A \\"Combo\\" tally is kept of properly played notes like in other Bemani games, but always excludes the first note played; for example, if a song has 322 notes, the maximum combo will be 321. Until Pop'n Music 6, \\"Good\\" notes would interrupt a player's combo. Each song is represented by a character, and players are represented by characters too. The player can choose a character by pressing both yellow buttons on the mode selection screen, but as of Pop'n Music 19 TUNE STREET, the character selection screen automatically pops up after choosing a mode. The default player characters are anthropomorphic rabbit Mimi and anthropomorphic cat Nyami. In all modes from Pop'n Music 6 and onward, after a song is selected, a splash screen that is displayed showing the character, banner, and BPM of the song. When the player presses both yellow buttons at this screen, an options menu is displayed, where the player can edit the following gameplay options: *Hi-Speed: This option allows player to change the scrolling speed of the notes. *Pop-kun: This option changes the appearance of the notes that appear on the screen. *Appearance: The options here affect the visibility of the notes on the screen. *Random: These options affect how the patterns of notes are processed. Like other Bemani series games, the Pop'n Music games have a \\"Groove Gauge\\" that shows the player's performance. Continually playing the notes in the song properly will cause the Groove Gauge to rise. The goal of the player is to finish the song with the Groove Gauge in the \\"clear zone\\", a red portion that represents the top quarter of the bar. When the gauge is at its maximum, \\"Great\\" notes become \\"Fever\\"- this is purely aesthetic, providing no bonus to score, and usually causes the player's chosen character to perform a different animation. If a player ends a song while in Fever mode, the character's win animation is also often different. =Modes= Battle Mode Two players compete against each other on the same cabinet or controller using only three buttons (Green, Yellow, and White) to play the same note chart, and a fourth \\"action\\" button (Blue). As a player scores \\"Great\\" ratings on notes, a power meter increases near the bottom of the screen, and once it reaches a certain level, the player can press the action button. Doing so starts a minigame along the bottom of the screen, requiring the players to alternate pressing the action button in time with the song, in addition to playing the note chart. When one of the players misses, an Ojama is inflicted on them. Expert Mode Introduced in Pop'n Music 6 is Expert Mode (or Expert Courses), similar to Nonstop Mode in other Bemani series. The player selects from a pre-made course of four songs and plays through the selected course with a \\"Stamina\\" life bar that does not recover. In this mode, another accuracy score is added, \\"Cool\\". This makes songs played in these modes significantly more difficult to achieve high scores on, as the value of \\"Great\\" and \\"Good\\" are decreased. In this mode, \\"Great\\" does not become Fever, and instead \\"Cool\\" flashes in a similar manner to how \\"Fever\\" is displayed in other modes. Expert Mode was removed after Pop'n Music 18 Sengoku Retsuden, but returned in Pop'n Music Lapistoria. Challenge and Cho-Challenge Modes Introduced in Pop'n Music 5, Challenge Mode (CHALLENGE „É¢„Éº„Éâ) is a mode where players are not only scored on their individual songs, but are also given a Challenge Score. Each song is assigned a point value on a scale from 1 to 50 (formerly 1 to 43) regarding to the difficulty, and at the end of a game in one of these modes, the total is tallied. Additionally in these modes, options called \\"Norma\\" and \\"Ojama\\" may be used to add point values to the player's Challenge Score. A \\"Norma\\" is a set goal, while an \\"Ojama\\" is an active means of periodically distracting or disrupting the player. Up to two options can be activated at once. On specific numbers, a player may be allowed an \\"EXtra Stage\\", an additional stage in which the most difficult charts (EXTRA or \\"EX\\" charts) for certain songs may be played and unlocked. EXtra stages use a different gauge than usual, a \\"Stamina\\" gauge similar to the life bar in a fighting game, or Dance Dance Revolution's Life Gauge, where complete depletion means the end of the song. It was renamed \\"Normal Mode\\" in Pop'n Music 20 Fantasia. Cho-Challenge Mode (Ë∂ÖCHALLENGE „É¢„Éº„Éâ, \\"Super Challenge Mode\\") is similar to Challenge Mode, except that another accuracy score is added, \\"Cool\\". This makes songs played in these modes significantly more difficult to achieve high scores on, as the value of \\"Great\\" and \\"Good\\" are decreased. Starting from pop'n music portable on console releases and Pop'n Music 20 fantasia on arcade releases, \\"Cool\\" is always on, regarding to Challenge Mode and Cho-Challenge Mode are combined into one single mode.Pop'n Music 20: Fantasia general information on RemyWiki. Retrieved 2012-06-27. Osusume („Ç™„Çπ„Çπ„É°, Lit. \\"Recommendation\\") Introduced in Pop'n Music 9 is Osusume („Ç™„Çπ„Çπ„É°, Lit. \\"Recommendation\\") Mode, where the player is asked a series of questions, and the game provides an Expert course based on the player's answers. It was removed after Pop'n Music 11. Osusume was reintroduced in Pop'n Music 20: Fantasia as a song category within normal mode, containing a selection of songs the player might like, based on the player's song selection history. Net Taisen Mode (NETÂØæÊà¶ „É¢„Éº„Éâ, \\"Net Battle Mode\\") With the introduction of the e-AMUSEMENT system in Japan, pop'n music 12 Iroha is the first game to feature \\"Net Taisen Mode\\" (NETÂØæÊà¶ „É¢„Éº„Éâ, \\"Net Battle Mode\\"). This mode allows players to compete over the e-AMUSEMENT network in real time with players on other e-AMUSEMENT-ready cabinets. In Pop'n Music 17 The Movie, a CPU-emulated version of this mode has been added, similar to the \\"Taisen\\" mode found on consumer releases. Enjoy Mode Starting in pop'n music 12 Iroha, \\"Normal Mode\\", the standard mode of play, has been removed, replaced instead by \\"Enjoy Mode\\". Enjoy Mode is a simplified mode for beginners with a reduced song list, simple note charts, and a less complex grading system, in which the player begins with 100 points and is docked one for each note they fail to play properly. Enjoy Mode incorporates many of the games licensed tracks, providing most players in Japan a mode in which they know the songs and can more easily become interested in the game. Enjoy Mode was renamed \\"Easy Mode\\" in Pop'n Music 20 Fantasia, and removed as a whole in Pop'n Music Sunny Park, to be replaced with a new difficulty for Normal Mode: \\"Easy\\". Design and Difficulty Unlike most other Bemani games, the games in Pop'n Music do not mimic an instrument in gameplay. The buttons are used to play various instruments throughout any given song. The graphics feature brightly colored and primarily solid shapes, rather than the metallic and textured interfaces of other Bemani games. Players may choose a character to play as. The songs are separated by genres like Reggae, Disco Queen, Spy, or Anime Hero, as well as common Bemani genres of eurobeat and forms of electronica. There are also series of songs with similar elements, like the Classic series (which are medleys of classical music) and the Powerfolk series. Each song has a variety of modes. These include Enjoy Mode (beginner and Easy notes), 5-line Mode (for 5 buttons) and Normal mode (on- beat notes and simple chords). Most songs have a hyper mode (with more notes and harder chords), and some songs have an EXtra mode (with lots of notes and complicated chords). Pop'n Music has no other visuals except for the character the player chose, an opponent character, and the scrolling notes. The characters are animated, and act differently based on the player's performance. Pop'n Music games can be challenging at high difficulty levels. The higher difficulty levels are considered by some players to be the most challenging of any music game. However, Pop'n Music also features easier content for beginners. In this way, Pop'n Music caters to a wide variety of players.

(February 7, 2020) =Pop'n Music Mickey Tunes (2000)= Pop'n Music Mickey Tunes contains Disney music and Disney characters as opposed to the usual characters and songs made specifically for the Pop'n Music series. The PlayStation port is known as Pop'n Music Disney Tunes. =Pop'n Music Animelo 2 (2001)= Pop'n Music Animelo 2 is the most expensive Pop'n Music version to date, due to its song list consisting completely of anime, as well as television show, licensed songs. This version is also the only one with the infamous \\"double\\" and \\"triple\\" modes. These options were originally provided with the intention of allowing multiple people to play along by adding one or two more notes for every note in the chart, sometimes resulting in a chord of all nine buttons. However, it became a popular challenge for a single player to play a song in \\"double\\" or \\"triple\\" mode. Consumer software =Home versions= The first four console games for the Pop'n Music series were released on the PlayStation and the Dreamcast, with nine buttons on the controller. Two other main games were released exclusively for the PlayStation, while two spin-offs were released for both the PlayStation and the Game Boy Color. These games are as follows: * Pop'n Music * Pop'n Music 2 * Pop'n Music 3 Append Disc * Pop'n Music 4 Append Disc * Pop'n Music 5 * Pop'n Music 6 * Pop'n Music Animation Melody * Pop'n Music Disney Tunes The first two games share 19 songs in common. Pop'n Music 2 also added 27 new songs, for a total of 46, and features Key Disc technology to allow play of Append Disc games. Pop'n Music 3 features a total of 44 songs, split between 22 new songs and 22 returning songs, though eight of these returning songs feature more challenging Hyper charts instead. As an Append Disc, it functions like an expansion pack, requiring a Key Disc to play. Pop'n Music 4 features a total of 41 songs, of which five are returning. This is the final release for Dreamcast. Like its predecessor, it requires a Key Disc. Pop'n Music 5 was the first game in the main series to be exclusive to PlayStation. It featured 63 songs. Like Pop'n Music 2, it also features Key Disc technology, allowing play of its two predecessors. Pop'n Music 6 featured 104 songs, the largest library available for the original PlayStation and the final game for that system. Like its predecessor and Pop'n Music 2, it also features Key Disc technology. Future console games for the main series and one compilation, all released from 2002 to 2007, are PlayStation 2 exclusives: * Pop'n Music 7 * Pop'n Music 8 * Pop'n Music 9 * Pop'n Music 10 * Pop'n Music 11 * Pop'n Music 12 „ÅÑ„Çç„ÅØ (Iroha) * Pop'n Music 13 „Ç´„Éº„Éã„Éê„É´ (Carnival) * Pop'n Music 14 FEVER! * Pop'n Music Best Hits A revised controller was also released for the PS2 at the same time as Pop'n Music 10, though it is also compatible with the original PlayStation. =Handheld versions= Pop'n Music Anywhere was a mini-game released for the VMU and PocketStation, handheld memory cards for the Dreamcast and PlayStation, respectively. The mini-game can be loaded using Pop'n Music 2 and Pop'n Music 4 for each respective console. Pop'n Music GB was released on March 30, 2000 for the Game Boy Color. It features 25 songs. Two spin-offs, Pop'n Music Animation Melody and Pop'n Music Disney Tunes, were released in September 2000. All games use five buttons for charts instead of nine. On February 4, 2010, Pop'n Music Portable was released on PlayStation Portable. It is intended to be the console release for Pop'n Music 15 Adventure, and so the song list and interface are based on that game. A sequel, Pop'n Music Portable 2 was released on November 23, 2011. The game is based on Pop'n Music 16 PARTY, and offers DLC songs available for purchase. Pop'n Stage Pop'n Stage is a dancing game based around the Pop'n Music design and songs, with ten \\"switches\\" (four diagonals and a center on each side, just like Pump It Up's panel placement). It is a combination of Pop'n Music and Dance Dance Revolution, using Pop'n-style graphics with DDR-style gameplay. The game has a bright, colorful interface and machine design, and is considered easy compared to most other Bemani games. The game is also keysounded, similarly to Pop'n Music, meaning that missing a step will result in corresponding sounds in the song not being played. Pop'n Stage breaks up gameplay styles in an unconventional way compared to other dance games; the default single player mode uses 6-switches (corresponding to Pump It Up's half double; in other words, 6-switch mode doesn't use the four outer corners). Meanwhile, 10-switch mode is the default 2-player configuration on \\"Normal\\" and \\"Hard\\" modes (corresponding to 5-switches per person on each side, similar to Pump It Up's single player mode) and \\"Maniac\\" mode being similar to a single-player \\"double-play\\" mode. One upgrade kit was released for this franchise before being cancelled under the name \\"Pop'n Stage EX\\". This upgrade fixed a handful of gameplay issues from the first game, added new charts and \\"Expert mode\\" stages, and added songs from \\"Pop'n Music 3\\" (as well as the song \\"Full Moon\\" by LITTLE CURE, which has never been used on another Bemani game since). Both versions of the game ran on Konami's \\"DJ Main\\" arcade hardware. Adaptation * Pop'n Music Wakuwaku!

The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander. According to this account Marcomer, Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania Inferior and Gallia Belgica in Gaul. They broke through the limes, killed many people, destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city of Cologne panic. After this raid, the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty. Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian woods. When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus, Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier, they attacked those remaining Frankish forces and killed many of them. After this engagement, Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country, however his army was surrounded and beaten. Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes, others were killed by Franks; few made it back to their Empire. Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus, who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks. Later, after the fall of Magnus Maximus, Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes, who was a general (magister militum) in the Roman army. The Franks delivered hostages as usual, and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier. A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries, he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania, because he hated his own kin. Marcomer was seen as leader with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage. Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was arrested by Romans and banned to a villa in Tuscany. His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to settle himself as leader of the band of Marchomir, however he was killed by his own people. According to the later Liber Historiae Francorum, Marcomer tried to unite the Franks after the death of Sunno. He proposed that the Franks should live under one king and proposed his own son Pharamond (whose earliest mention is in this work, and who is considered mythological by scholars) for the kingship. This source does not relate whether Marcomer succeeded, but from other later sources that recall the account of Liber Historiae Francorum, the impression may be gained that Pharamond was regarded as the first king of the Franks. However, modern scholars, such as Edward James, do not accept this account in the Liber Historiae Francorum as historical, because Marcomer is called the son of the Trojan king Priam. Traditionally Marcomer is also known as Marcomir VI, and made a descendant of King Priam Podarces of Troy by Priam's son Helenus, from whom the Kings of Cimmerian Bosporus were said to descend.

Biography According to Sacher's son Eduard, in 1832 Austria's minister of foreign affairs, Prince Metternich, ordered his court's kitchen to create a special dessert for a dinner to be attended by high- ranking guests. Dass er mir aber keine Schand' macht, heut' Abend! (\\"Let there be no shame on me tonight!\\"), he is reported to have declared. Unfortunately, on the day of the dinner the chief cook of Metternich's household was taken ill, and the task of preparing the dessert had to be passed to Franz Sacher, then in his second year of apprenticeship at the palace. The result would be the chocolate cake devised on the spot by the 16-year-old trainee.

A hardtop roof can be either fixed (i.e. not removable), detachable for separate storing or retractable within the vehicle itself. Pillarless hardtop (often referred to as simply \\"hardtop\\") is a body style of cars without a B-pillar, which are often styled to give the appearance of a convertible design.  Pillarless hardtops  1976 Chrysler New Yorker with doors open. Note the half-height pillar to which the rear doors attach. The pillarless hardtop (often abbreviated to \\"hardtop\\") is a hardtop with no B-pillar which is often styled to look like a convertible. If window frames are present, they are designed to retract with the glass when lowered. This creates an impression of uninterrupted glass along the side of the car. A pillarless hardtop is inherently less rigid than a pillared body, requiring extra underbody strength to prevent shake. Production hardtops commonly shared the frame or reinforced body structure of the contemporary convertible model, which was already reinforced to compensate for the lack of a fixed roof. Hardtops tend to be more expensive and collectible than sedan models of the same vehicle. Some hardtop models took the convertible look even further, including such details as simulating a convertible-top framework in the interior headliner and shaping the roof to resemble a raised canvas top. By the late-1960s such designs could be highlighted with an optional vinyl cover applied on the steel roof. The hardtop began to disappear along with convertibles in the mid-1970s, partly out of a concern that U.S. federal safety regulations would be difficult for pillarless models to pass. The ascendancy of monocoque construction also made the pillarless design less practical. Some models adopted modified roof styling, placing the B pillars behind tinted side window glass and painting or molding the outer side of each pillar in black to make them less visible, creating a hardtop look without actually omitting the pillar. Some mid- to late-1970s models continued their previous two-door hardtop bodies, but with fixed rear windows or a variety of vinyl roof and opera window treatments. By the end of the 1990s, almost all hardtop designs disappeared as structural integrity standards continued to increase. = Origins = California Top on a 1926 Studebaker Phaeton Early automobiles had no roof or sides, however by 1900 several cars were offered with fabric roofs and primitive folding tops. However, cars with fully closed bodies (i.e. with a rigid roof and sides) grew in popularity and soon became the norm. In 1915‚Äì1918, the first pillarless hardtop cars were produced, then called \\"convertible cars\\" (or \\"touring sedans\\" or \\"Springfields\\"). The Springfield design featured folding upper frames on the doors and the rear glass frames are removable and stored under or behind the seats. In the late teens, Cadillac offered a sedan with removable \\"B\\" pillars. Another form of early pillarless hardtop is the \\"California top\\", originating in Los Angeles and most popular from 1917‚Äî1927. These were designed to replace the folding roofs of touring cars, in order to enclose the sides of the car for better weather protection. One objective of these aftermarket tops was to bring the cost of the closed car nearer to the prices of corresponding open cars. Automobile dealers were encouraged to equip an open car with a California top to demonstrate that they were \\"cool and clean in summer, and warm and dry in winter.\\" The hard tops were frequently equipped with celluloid windows that retracted like a roller blind for open sided motoring offering a low-cost compromise between an open and closed car. =United States= There were a variety of hardtop-like body styles dating back to 1916. Chrysler Corporation built seven pillarless Town and Country hardtop coupes as concept vehicles in 1946, and even included the body style in its advertising that year. Mass- production of hardtops began with General Motors, which launched two-door, pillarless hardtops in 1949 as the Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, and Cadillac Coupe de Ville. They were purportedly inspired by the wife of a Buick executive who always drove convertibles, but never lowered the top. The Kaiser-Frazer 1949 Virginian was an early example of a four-door hardtop albeit with a removable thin, chrome- and-glass 'B' pillar held on by five screws. The car was designed to have a convertible look and padded nylon or cotton was applied over the roof to contribute to the soft-top appearance. Two-door hardtops became popular with consumers in the 1950s while the two- door sedan body design fell out of favor among buyers. In 1955, General Motors introduced the first four-door hardtops. Following the pattern established by the two-door variants, GM utilized the same special sub-designations for the pillarless four-door body types within all their brands in North America. The term de Ville was used for Cadillac, Riviera was used for Buick, Holiday was used for Oldsmobile, Catalina was used for Pontiac, and Bel Air was used for Chevrolet. Other manufacturers also designated special names for their pillarless models. Ford called them Victoria, Chrysler used Newports, Packard named them Mayfair, and Hudson's were Hollywoods. Nash used the Country Club moniker while pillarless Studebakers were Starliners, a name that was later used by Ford for its Galaxie hardtop. By 1956 every major U.S. automaker offered two- and four-door hardtops in a particular model lineup. General Motors restyled their new models and now offered four-door hardtops from every division and in nearly every series except the lowest priced lines. In 1956, the first four-door hardtop station wagons were introduced by Rambler and American Motors Corporation. The following year, the Mercury Commuter hardtop wagons became available in both two- and four-door body styles. Throughout the 1960s the two-door pillarless hardtop was by far the most popular body style in most lines where such a model was offered. Even on family-type vehicles like the Chevrolet Impala, the two-door hardtop regularly outsold four-door sedans. Some car lines (such as the 1957-64 Cadillac and 1965-69 Corvair) only offered pillarless models with no sedans at all. So prevalent were true hardtops that Popular Mechanics had to describe that the new full-sized 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont models also included a \\"pillar\\" sedan. The U.S. industry's last pillarless two-door and four-door hardtops were in the 1978 Chrysler Newport and New Yorker lines. Since then, no U.S. manufacturer has offered a true hardtop in regular production. =Japan= 1972 Toyota Crown with side windows lowered In July 1965 Toyota introduced Japan's first 2-door hardtop coupe, and August 1967 they installed the 1,587 cc DOHC 9R engine in the Toyota 1600GT. This followed with several manufacturers offering the popular bodystyle as a luxury car appearance. During the 1970s, Toyota produced the Toyota Crown in a pillarless two-door hardtop version. Nissan followed suit with the Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria in 4-door sedan and 2-door hardtop body styles, with the latter \\"rendered as a premium quality personal car.\\" Subaru introduced a new compact coupe as a genuine two-door hardtop with the Subaru Leone in 1971. The pillarless hardtop models were more expensive and luxurious than the sedan versions. In the 1980s, Toyota continued the design with the Mark II, Nissan with its Laurel, and Mazda marketing its Luce. =Europe= Two 1973 Sunbeam Rapiers: first with side windows lowered and raised on the second car Various European manufacturers have produced hardtops without B-pillars (usually coupes), however they are rarely marketed as pillarless hardtops. Examples include the current Bentley Continental GT, the 2008 Bentley Brooklands, the 2001-2003 Renault Avantime, the Rolls-Royce Wraith, and the 2012-current Ford B-Max. The 1958-1964 Facel Vega Excellence is one of few four-door hardtops produced in Europe. British pillarless hardtops included the Sunbeam Rapier and the Ford Consul Capri (355) which, unlike American models, sold fewer cars than their regular center pillar saloon versions. A New Mini two-door sedan has been marketed as a hardtop in the United States, although it does have a B-pillar, which is disguised by being painted black.  Detachable hardtops  1959 Daimler SP250 with detachable hardtop A detachable hardtop is a rigid, removable roof panel that is often stored in a car's trunk/boot.  Retractable hardtops  2005 Volvo C70 with retractable hardtop A retractable hardtop (also known as coup√© convertible or coup√© cabriolet) is a type of convertible that forgoes a folding textile roof in favor of an automatically operated, multi-part, self- storing roof where the rigid roof sections are opaque, translucent, or independently operable.

Sachertorte from Budapest. Sachertorte as a present. Caf√© Sacher shop interior. Sachertorte () is a chocolate cake, or torte of Austrian origin, invented by Franz Sacher, supposedly in 1832 for Prince Metternich in Vienna.Michael Krondl, Sweet Invention: A History of Dessert, , 2011, p. 290: \\"my best guess is that the Metternich creation story originates with Eduard Sacher\\" It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties. History According to Franz Sacher's son Eduard, sachertorte was invented by Franz, when he was an apprentice under Chancellor Metternich's chef, one ma√Ætre Chambellier. The story goes that Franz was required to create a novel cake when the chef was ill. The Metternich connection was probably invented by Eduard many years later, to appeal to \\"Viennese nostalgic for their imperial past\\". Sachertorte remains popular in Austria and worldwide. Composition The cake consists of a dense chocolate cake with a thin layer of apricot jam on top, coated in dark chocolate icing on the top and sides. It is traditionally served with unsweetened whipped cream.Original Sachertorte (German) Variations The \\"Original\\" Sacher Torte has two layers of apricot jam between the outer layer of chocolate icing and the sponge base, while Demel's \\"Eduard-Sacher-Torte\\" has only one. Demel's cake is denser and smoother. Some of the various recipes for cakes similar to the \\"Original\\" are listed below. For example, at \\"Graz- Kulturhauptstadt 2003\\", a festival marking the city of Graz being declared cultural capital that year, \\"Sacher-Masoch-Torte\\" was presented (its name alluding to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch), using redcurrant jam and marzipan. Production and sale of the \\"Original Sacher Torte\\" Hotel Sacher's \\"Original Sacher Torte\\" is sold at the Vienna and Salzburg locations of the Hotel Sacher, at Cafe Sacher branches in Innsbruck and Graz, at the Sacher Shop in Bolzano, in the Duty Free area of Vienna airport, and via the Hotel Sacher's online shop. The recipe of the Hotel Sacher's version of the cake is a closely guarded secret. Those privy to it claim that the secret to the Sacher Torte's desirability lies not in the ingredients of the cake itself, but rather those of the chocolate icing. According to widely available information, the icing consists of three special types of chocolate, which are produced exclusively by different manufacturers for this sole purpose. The hotel obtains these products from L√ºbeck in Germany and from Belgium. The Hotel Sacher has gone to great lengths to distinguish the Original Sacher Torte from other variations. This includes four golden corners on the wooden box, the wood engraving of the Hotel Sacher Wien as well as \\"Das Original\\" and \\"Hotel Sacher Wien\\" in writing in the inside of the lid, and bordeaux red wrapping paper with a Biedermeier motif. =Legal dispute with Demel's= In 1934, the Demel pastry shop started selling \\"Eduard Sacher-Torte\\", while the Sacher Hotel sold the \\"Original Sacher-Torte\\". The hotel's owners sued Demel for trademark infringement, and won in 1938. The lawsuit was appealed after the war, and the hotel was eventually given the exclusive right to call its version \\"the original\\".Michael Krondl, \\"Sachertorte\\", The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, , p. 589 Other 5 December is National Sachertorte Day in the United States.

It features open style breakers, mounted on slabs of slate stone insulator. An electric switchboard is a device that directs electricity from one or more sources of supply to several smaller regions of usage. It is an assembly of one or more panels, each of which contains switches that allow electricity to be redirected. A switchboard is divided into different interconnected sections, generally consisting of a main section and a distribution section. These two sections are sometimes replaced by a combination section, which is a section that can fulfill the roles of both aforementioned sections\\"NEMA Standards Publication 2-2011 Deadfront Distribution Switchboards,\\" Rosslyn, VA: National Electrical Manufacturers Association, 2011. https://www.nema.org/Standards/Pages/Deadfront- Distribution-Switchboards.aspx . Switchboards can also sometimes come with an auxiliary section that is used to house devices that cannot be housed in the same section as other devices. Definition The U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC) defines a switchboard as \\"a large single panel, frame, or assembly of panels on which are mounted, on the face, back, or both, switches, over-current and other protective devices, buses, and usually instruments\\". The role of a switchboard is to allow the division of the current supplied to the switchboard into smaller currents for further distribution and to provide switching, current protection and (possibly) metering for those various currents. In general, switchboards may distribute power to transformers, panelboards, control equipment, and, ultimately, to individual system loads. Components Inside a switchboard there will be one or more busbars. These are flat strips of copper or aluminum, to which the switchgear is connected. Busbars carry large currents through the switchboard, and are supported by insulators. Bare busbars are common, but many types are now manufactured with an insulating cover on the bars, leaving only connection points exposed. The operator is protected from electrocution by safety switches and fuses. There may also be controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard, coming from a generator or bank of electrical generators, especially frequency control of AC power and load sharing controls, plus gauges showing frequency and perhaps a synchroscope. The amount of power going into a switchboard must always be substantially equal to the power going out to the loads ( less the losses in internal conductors and consumption by internal devices such as pilot lamps, space heaters, or others). Enclosure Modern industrial switchboards are metal enclosed and of \\"dead front\\" construction; no energized parts are accessible when the covers and panels are closed. Previously, open switchboards were made with switches and other devices were mounted on panels made of slate, granite, or ebony asbestos board. The metal enclosure of the switchboard is bonded to earth ground for protection of personnel. Large switchboards may be free- standing floor-mounted enclosures with provision for incoming connections at either the top or bottom of the enclosure. A switchboard may have incoming bus bars or bus duct for the source connection, and also for large circuits fed from the board. A switchboard may include a metering or control compartment separated from the power distribution conductors.

They also use PHP and BBCode. History The station was started in February 2000 by Bill Goldsmith and his wife Rebecca Goldsmith. It was originally operated from their home in Paradise, California, from which the station derives its name. The station had relocated to the Borrego Valley (east of San Diego, California) in 2016, before the town of Paradise was largely destroyed by the Camp fire in November 2018. Bill has been a DJ at various stations (including KPIG, KFAT, KLRB, WCAS, and KPOI) since 1971, and has also been a radio station manager and a radio & TV engineer. In August 1995 Goldsmith inaugurated the world's first full-time webcast at KPIG using Xing Streamworks software. Radio Paradise was featured in a TIME magazine article of April 11, 2004 called \\"The Revolution In Radio\\". April 2006, RP introduced the Listeners World Map, showing the numbers and locations of listeners across the world, currently located under Help + Info/Member info. In June 2006 Radio Paradise began trial runs of Octoshape for its 192 kbit/s MP3 stream. In September 2006, the station began a 128 kbit/s AAC stream.

They are the original Humanist Manifesto (1933, often referred to as Humanist Manifesto I), the Humanist Manifesto II (1973), and Humanism and Its Aspirations (2003, a.k.a. Humanist Manifesto III). The Manifesto originally arose from religious humanism, though secular humanists also signed. The central theme of all three manifestos is the elaboration of a philosophy and value system which does not necessarily include belief in any personal deity or \\"higher power\\", although the three differ considerably in their tone, form, and ambition. Each has been signed at its launch by various prominent members of academia and others who are in general agreement with its principles. In addition, there is a similar document entitled A Secular Humanist Declaration published in 1980 by the Council for Secular Humanism. Humanist Manifesto I The first manifesto, entitled simply A Humanist Manifesto, was written in 1933 primarily by Roy Wood Sellars and Raymond Bragg and was published with 34 signatories including philosopher John Dewey. Unlike the later ones, the first Manifesto talked of a new \\"religion\\", and referred to Humanism as a religious movement to transcend and replace previous religions that were based on allegations of supernatural revelation. The document outlines a fifteen-point belief system, which, in addition to a secular outlook, opposes \\"acquisitive and profit-motivated society\\" and outlines a worldwide egalitarian society based on voluntary mutual cooperation, language which was considerably softened by the Humanists' board, owners of the document, twenty years later. The title \\"A Humanist Manifesto\\"‚Äîrather than \\"The Humanist Manifesto\\"‚Äîwas intentional, predictive of later Manifestos to follow, as indeed has been the case. Unlike the creeds of major organized religions, the setting out of Humanist ideals in these Manifestos is an ongoing process. Indeed, in some communities of Humanists the compilation of personal Manifestos is actively encouraged, and throughout the Humanist movement it is accepted that the Humanist Manifestos are not permanent or authoritative dogmas but are to be subject to ongoing critique. Humanist Manifesto II The second Manifesto was written in 1973 by Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson, and was intended to update and replace the previous one. It begins with a statement that the excesses of Nazism and World War II had made the first seem \\"far too optimistic\\", and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its seventeen-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version. Nevertheless, much of the unbridled optimism of the first remained, with hopes stated that war would become obsolete and poverty would be eliminated. Many of the proposals in the document, such as opposition to racism and weapons of mass destruction and support of strong human rights, are fairly uncontroversial, and its prescriptions that divorce and birth control should be legal and that technology can improve life are widely accepted today in much of the Western world. Furthermore, its proposal of an international court has since been implemented. However, in addition to its rejection of supernaturalism, various controversial stances are strongly supported, notably the right to abortion. Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more, and indeed the AHA website encourages visitors to add their own names. A provision at the end noted that signators do \\"not necessarily endors[e] every detail\\" of the document. Among the oft- quoted lines from this 1973 Manifesto are, \\"No deity will save us; we must save ourselves,\\" and \\"We are responsible for what we are and for what we will be,\\" both of which may present difficulties for members of certain Christian, Jewish, and Muslim sects, or other believers in doctrines of submission to the will of an all-powerful God. Humanist Manifesto III Humanism and Its Aspirations, subtitled Humanist Manifesto III, a successor to the Humanist Manifesto of 1933, was published in 2003 by the AHA, and was written by committee. Signatories included 21 Nobel laureates. The new document is the successor to the previous ones, and the name \\"Humanist Manifesto\\" is the property of the American Humanist Association. The newest manifesto is deliberately much shorter, listing seven primary themes, which echo those from its predecessors:http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III * Knowledge of the world is derived by observation, experimentation, and rational analysis. (See empiricism.) * Humans are an integral part of nature, the result of evolutionary change, an unguided process. * Ethical values are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience. (See ethical naturalism.) * Life‚Äôs fulfillment emerges from individual participation in the service of humane ideals. * Humans are social by nature and find meaning in relationships. * Working to benefit society maximizes individual happiness. Other Manifestos for Humanism Aside from the official Humanist Manifestos of the American Humanist Association (\\"AHA\\"), there have been other similar documents. \\"Humanist Manifesto\\" is a trademark of the AHA. Formulation of new statements in emulation of the three Humanist Manifestos is encouraged, and examples follow. =A Secular Humanist Declaration= In 1980, the Council for Secular Humanism, founded by Paul Kurtz, which is typically more detailed in its discussions regarding the function of Humanism than the AHA, published what is in effect its manifesto, entitled A Secular Humanist Declaration. It has as its main points: # Free Inquiry # Separation of Church and State # The Ideal of Freedom # Ethics Based on Critical Intelligence # Moral Education # Religious Skepticism # Reason # Science and Technology # Evolution # Education A Secular Humanist Declaration was an argument for and statement of support for democratic secular humanism. The document was issued in 1980 by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (\\"CODESH\\"), now the Council for Secular Humanism (\\"CSH\\"). Compiled by Paul Kurtz, it is largely a restatement of the content of the American Humanist Association's 1973 Humanist Manifesto II, of which he was co-author with Edwin H. Wilson. Both Wilson and Kurtz had served as editors of The Humanist, from which Kurtz departed in 1979 and thereafter set about establishing his own movement and his own periodical. His Secular Humanist Declaration was the starting point for these enterprises. =Humanist Manifesto 2000= Humanist Manifesto 2000: A Call for New Planetary Humanism is a book by Paul Kurtz published in 2000. It differs from the other three in that it is a full-length book rather than essay-length, and was published not by the American Humanist Association but by the Council for Secular Humanism. In it, Kurtz argues for many of the points already formulated in Humanist Manifesto 2, of which he had been co-author in 1973. =Amsterdam Declaration= The Amsterdam Declaration 2002 is a statement of the fundamental principles of modern Humanism passed unanimously by the General Assembly of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) at the 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress in 2002. According to the IHEU, the declaration \\"is the official statement of World Humanism.\\" It is officially supported by all member organisations of the IHEU including: *American Humanist Association *British Humanist Association *Humanist Canada *Council of Australian Humanist Societies *Council for Secular Humanism *Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association *Human-Etisk Forbund, the Norwegian Humanist Association *Humanist Association of Ireland *Indian Humanist Union *Philippine Atheists and Agnostics Society (PATAS) A complete list of signatories can be found on the IHEU page (see references). This declaration makes exclusive use of capitalized Humanist and Humanism, which is consistent with IHEU's general practice and recommendations for promoting a unified Humanist identity. To further promote Humanist identity, these words are also free of any adjectives, as recommended by prominent members of IHEU. Such usage is not universal among IHEU member organizations, though most of them do observe these conventions.

Unlike the later manifestos, this first talks of a new religion and refers to humanism as \\"the religion of the future.\\" Nevertheless, it is careful not to express a creed or dogma.http://huumanists.org/about/religious-humanism The document outlines fifteen affirmations on cosmology, biological and cultural evolution, human nature, epistemology, ethics, religion, self-fulfillment, and the quest for freedom and social justice. This latter, stated in article fourteen, proved to be the most controversial, even among humanists, in its opposition to \\"acquisitive and profit-motivated society\\" and its demand for an egalitarian world community based on voluntary mutual cooperation. The document's release was reported by the mainstream media on May 1, simultaneous with its publication in the May/June 1933 issue of the New Humanist. Two manifestos followed: Humanist Manifesto II in 1973 and Humanism and Its Aspirations in 2003.  Text of the Humanist manifesto I  The time has come for widespread recognition of the radical changes in religious beliefs throughout the modern world. The time is past for mere revision of traditional attitudes. Science and economic change have disrupted the old beliefs. Religions the world over are under the necessity of coming to terms with new conditions created by a vastly increased knowledge and experience. In every field of human activity, the vital movement is now in the direction of a candid and explicit humanism. In order that religious humanism may be better understood we, the undersigned, desire to make certain affirmations which we believe the facts of our contemporary life demonstrate. There is great danger of a final, and we believe fatal, identification of the word religion with doctrines and methods which have lost their significance and which are powerless to solve the problem of human living in the Twentieth Century. Religions have always been means for realizing the highest values of life. Their end has been accomplished through the interpretation of the total environing situation (theology or world view), the sense of values resulting therefrom (goal or ideal), and the technique (cult), established for realizing the satisfactory life. A change in any of these factors results in alteration of the outward forms of religion. This fact explains the changefulness of religions through the centuries. But through all changes religion itself remains constant in its quest for abiding values, an inseparable feature of human life. Today man's larger understanding of the universe, his scientific achievements, and deeper appreciation of brotherhood, have created a situation which requires a new statement of the means and purposes of religion. Such a vital, fearless, and frank religion capable of furnishing adequate social goals and personal satisfactions may appear to many people as a complete break with the past. While this age does owe a vast debt to the traditional religions, it is none the less obvious that any religion that can hope to be a synthesizing and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present. It is a responsibility which rests upon this generation. We therefore affirm the following: FIRST: Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created. SECOND: Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process. THIRD: Holding an organic view of life, humanists find that the traditional dualism of mind and body must be rejected. FOURTH: Humanism recognizes that man's religious culture and civilization, as clearly depicted by anthropology and history, are the product of a gradual development due to his interaction with his natural environment and with his social heritage. The individual born into a particular culture is largely molded by that culture. FIFTH: Humanism asserts that the nature of the universe depicted by modern science makes unacceptable any supernatural or cosmic guarantees of human values. Obviously humanism does not deny the possibility of realities as yet undiscovered, but it does insist that the way to determine the existence and value of any and all realities is by means of intelligent inquiry and by the assessment of their relations to human needs. Religion must formulate its hopes and plans in the light of the scientific spirit and method. SIXTH: We are convinced that the time has passed for theism, deism, modernism, and the several varieties of \\"new thought\\". SEVENTH: Religion consists of those actions, purposes, and experiences which are humanly significant. Nothing human is alien to the religious. It includes labor, art, science, philosophy, love, friendship, recreation--all that is in its degree expressive of intelligently satisfying human living. The distinction between the sacred and the secular can no longer be maintained. EIGHTH: Religious Humanism considers the complete realization of human personality to be the end of man's life and seeks its development and fulfillment in the here and now. This is the explanation of the humanist's social passion. NINTH: In the place of the old attitudes involved in worship and prayer the humanist finds his religious emotions expressed in a heightened sense of personal life and in a cooperative effort to promote social well- being. TENTH: It follows that there will be no uniquely religious emotions and attitudes of the kind hitherto associated with belief in the supernatural. ELEVENTH: Man will learn to face the crises of life in terms of his knowledge of their naturalness and probability. Reasonable and manly attitudes will be fostered by education and supported by custom. We assume that humanism will take the path of social and mental hygiene and discourage sentimental and unreal hopes and wishful thinking. TWELFTH: Believing that religion must work increasingly for joy in living, religious humanists aim to foster the creative in man and to encourage achievements that add to the satisfactions of life. THIRTEENTH: Religious humanism maintains that all associations and institutions exist for the fulfillment of human life. The intelligent evaluation, transformation, control, and direction of such associations and institutions with a view to the enhancement of human life is the purpose and program of humanism. Certainly religious institutions, their ritualistic forms, ecclesiastical methods, and communal activities must be reconstituted as rapidly as experience allows, in order to function effectively in the modern world. FOURTEENTH: The humanists are firmly convinced that existing acquisitive and profit-motivated society has shown itself to be inadequate and that a radical change in methods, controls, and motives must be instituted. A socialized and cooperative economic order must be established to the end that the equitable distribution of the means of life be possible. The goal of humanism is a free and universal society in which people voluntarily and intelligently cooperate for the common good. Humanists demand a shared life in a shared world. FIFTEENTH AND LAST: We assert that humanism will: (a) affirm life rather than deny it; (b) seek to elicit the possibilities of life, not flee from them; and (c) endeavor to establish the conditions of a satisfactory life for all, not merely for the few. By this positive morale and intention humanism will be guided, and from this perspective and alignment the techniques and efforts of humanism will flow. So stand the theses of religious humanism. Though we consider the religious forms and ideas of our fathers no longer adequate, the quest for the good life is still the central task for mankind. Man is at last becoming aware that he alone is responsible for the realization of the world of his dreams, that he has within himself the power for its achievement. He must set intelligence and will to the task.  List of signers  Of the 65 people who were asked to sign, 34 accepted. About half (15) were Unitarians.Preface The 34 were: *J. A. C.

Allied forces advanced over on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with Gen Henry Rawlinson's British Fourth Army (with 9 of its 19 divisions supplied by the fast moving Australian Corps of Lt Gen John Monash and Canadian Corps of Lt Gen Arthur Currie) playing the decisive role. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides' morale and the large number of surrendering German forces. This led Erich Ludendorff to later describe the first day of the battle as \\"the black day of the German Army\\". Amiens was one of the first major battles involving armoured warfare.  Prelude  On 21 March 1918, the German Army had launched Operation Michael, the first in a series of attacks planned to drive the Allies back along the length of the Western Front. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with revolutionary-controlled Russia, the Germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to the Western Front, giving them a significant, if temporary, advantage in manpower and material. These offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory. Operation Michael was intended to defeat the right wing of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but a lack of success around Arras ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of Amiens, a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at Villers-Bretonneux by British and Australian troops on 4 April. Subsequent German offensives‚ÄîOperation Georgette (9‚Äì11 April), Operation Bl√ºcher-Yorck (27 May), Operation Gneisenau (9 June) and Operation Marne-Rheims (15‚Äì17 July)‚Äîall made advances elsewhere on the Western Front, but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. By the end of the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German manpower advantage had been spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counteroffensive which led to victory at the Second Battle of the Marne, following which he was promoted to Marshal of France. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the Marne to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive. = Plan = Foch disclosed his plan on 23 July,Kearsey pp. 11‚Äì12 following the allied victory at the Battle of Soissons. The plan called for reducing the Saint-Mihiel salient (which would later see combat in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel) and freeing the railway lines that ran through Amiens from German shellfire. The commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, the headquarters of the British Fourth Army under General Sir Henry Rawlinson had taken over the front astride the Somme. Its left hand corps was the British III Corps under Lieutenant General Richard Butler, while the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General John Monash held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ, for the first time on the Western Front. The Australians had mounted a number of local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive, and established and refined the methods which were to be used.Blaxland pp. 154‚Äì156 Rawlinson had submitted Monash's proposals to Haig in July and Haig had forwarded them to Foch. At a meeting on 24 July, Foch agreed to the plan but insisted that the French First Army, which held the front to the south of the British Fourth Army, should participate. Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash's plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise, by avoiding a preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the element of surprise. Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate, but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army. It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 to 8 August, to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient. Rawlinson had already finalised his plans in discussion with his Corps commanders (Butler, Monash, Sir Arthur Currie of the Canadian Corps and Lieutenant General Charles Kavanagh of the Cavalry Corps) on 21 July. For the first time, the Australians would attack side by side with the Canadian Corps. Both had a reputation for aggressive and innovative tactics and a strong record of success over the past two years. The tactical methods had been tested by the Australians in a local counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the Battle of the Somme. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only at the moment the infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.Blaxland pp. 146‚Äì149 A key factor in the final plan was secrecy. There was to be no artillery bombardment a significant time before the attack, as was the usual practice, only fire immediately prior to the advance of Australian, Canadian, and British forces. The final plan for the Fourth Army involved 1,386 field guns and howitzers and 684 heavy guns, making up 27 medium artillery brigades and thirteen heavy batteries, in addition to the infantry divisions' artillery. The fire plan for the Fourth Army's artillery was devised by Monash's senior artillery officer, Major General C. E. D. Budworth. British sound ranging advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with \\"ranging shots\\" to ensure accurate fire. Budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 German guns to be hit at \\"zero hour\\", while a creeping barrage preceded the infantry. This method was similar to the Feuerwalze which the Germans themselves had used in their Spring Offensive, but its effectiveness was increased by the surprise achieved.Blaxland p. 168 There were also to be 580 tanks. The Canadian and Australian Corps were each allocated a brigade of four battalions, with 108 Mark V fighting tanks, 36 Mark V \\"Star\\", and 24 unarmed tanks intended to carry supplies and ammunition forward. A single battalion of Mark V tanks was allocated to III Corps. The Cavalry Corps were allocated two battalions each of 48 Medium Mark A Whippet tanks.Blaxland, p. 160 The Allies had successfully moved the Canadian Corps of four infantry divisions to Amiens without them being detected by the Germans. This was a noteworthy achievement and reflected well on the increasingly efficient staff work of the British armies. A detachment from the Corps of two infantry battalions, a wireless unit and a casualty clearing station had been sent to the front near Ypres to bluff the Germans that the entire Corps was moving north to Flanders.Blaxland p. 161 The Canadian Corps was not fully in position until 7 August. To maintain secrecy, the Allied commanders pasted the notice \\"Keep Your Mouth Shut\\" into orders issued to the men, and referred to the action as a \\"raid\\" rather than an \\"offensive\\".Kearsey pp. 13‚Äì14 = Preliminaries = Men of the Royal Garrison Artillery loading a 9.2-inch howitzer near Bayencourt just before the battle Although the Germans were still on the offensive in late July, the Allied armies were growing in strength, as more American units arrived in France, and British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The German commanders realised in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint- Mihiel front east of Rheims, or in Flanders near Mount Kemmel, while they believed the British would attack along either the Lys or near Albert. The Allies had indeed mounted a number of local counter-offensives in these sectors, both to gain local objectives to improve their defensive positions and to distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began to withdraw from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night, and feigning movements during the day to mask their actual intent. The German front east of Amiens was held by their Second Army under General Georg von der Marwitz, with six divisions in line (and two facing the French 1st Army). There were only two divisions in immediate reserve. There was some concern among the Allies on 6 August when the German 27th Division actually attacked north of the Somme on part of the front on which the Allies planned to attack two days later. The German division (a specially selected and trained Stosstruppen formation) penetrated roughly into the one-and-a-half-mile front.Blaxland p. 164 This attack was made in retaliation for a trench raid by the 5th Australian Division north of the Somme on the night of 31 July, which had taken many prisoners, before the Australian Corps was concentrated south of the river.Blaxland, p. 162 The German division moved back towards its original position on the morning of 7 August, but the movement still required changes to the Allied plan. To increase the level of surprise still further, the rumble of the approaching tanks was to be masked by bombers flying up and down the German lines. The bombers were twin engine Handley Page O-400's whose engines were similar to the tanks. However the 2 RAF squadrons detailed to take part decided it was too hazardous to order planes into the air in the unseasonably dense fog, and asked for volunteers. Two volunteered from 207 Squadron, Captains Gordon Flavelle and William Peace, and both were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\\"The Brave Young Wings\\", p168, Ronald Dodds, 1980, published by Canada's Wings, Inc. Sittsville, Ontario  Battle  Map depicting the advance of the Allied line =First Phase= The battle began in dense fog at 4:20 am on 8 August. Under Rawlinson's Fourth Army, the British III Corps attacked north of the Somme, the Australian Corps to the south of the river in the centre of Fourth Army's front, and the Canadian Corps to the south of the Australians. The French 1st Army under General Debeney opened its preliminary bombardment at the same time, and began its advance 45 minutes later, supported by a battalion of 72 Whippet tanks. Although German forces were on the alert, this was largely in anticipation of possible retaliation for their incursion on the sixthKearsey pp. 17‚Äì18 and not because they had learned of the preplanned Allied attack. Although the two forces were within of one another, gas bombardment was very low, as the bulk of the Allied presence was unknown to the Germans. The attack was so unexpected that German forces only began to return fire after five minutes, and even then at the positions where the Allied forces had assembled at the start of the battle and had long since left.Kearsey pp. 15‚Äì16 In the first phase, seven divisions attacked: the British 18th (Eastern) and 58th (2/1st London), the Australian 2nd and 3rd, and the Canadian 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions. Parts of the American 33rd Division supported the British attackers north of the Somme. The attackers captured the first German position, advancing about by about 7:30 am. In the centre, supporting units following the leading divisions attacked the second objective a further distant. Australian units reached their first objectives by 7:10 am, and by 8:20 am, the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions and the Canadian 4th Division passed through the initial breach in the German lines. The third phase of the attack was assigned to infantry-carrying Mark V* tanks; however, the infantry was able to carry out this final step unaided. The Allies penetrated well to the rear of the German defences and cavalry now continued the advance, one brigade in the Australian sector and two cavalry divisions in the Canadian sector. Aircraft fire by the new RAF and armoured car fire kept the retreating Germans from rallying. The Canadian and Australian forces in the centre advanced quickly, pushing the line forward from its starting point by 11:00 am. The speed of their advance was such that a party of German officers and some divisional staff were captured while eating breakfast. A gap long was punched in the German line south of the Somme by the end of the day. There was less success north of the river, where the British III Corps had only a single tank battalion in support, the terrain was rougher and the German incursion of 6 August had disrupted some of the preparations. The corps gained its first objectives but was held up short of the Chipilly spur, \\"a bare seventy-five-foot-high ridge\\" in an oxbow bend of the Somme River near the village of Chipilly.Blaxland, p.175 The British Fourth Army took 13,000 prisoners, and the French captured a further 3,000. Total German losses were estimated to be 30,000 on 8 August.Chronicles of World War One, Volume II: 1917‚Äì1921. Randal Gray, Facts on File: New York. 1991. The British, Australian and Canadian infantry of the Fourth Army sustained about 8,000 casualties, with further losses by tank and air personnel, and French forces. German Army Chief of Staff Paul von Hindenburg noted the Allies' use of surprise and that Allied destruction of German lines of communication had hampered potential German counter-attacks by isolating command positions.Hindenburg on Amiens by Paul von Hindenburg from Source Records of the Great War, Vol. VI, ed. Charles F. Horne, National Alumni 1923. The German General Erich Ludendorff described the first day of Amiens as the \\"Schwarzer Tag des deutschen Heeres\\" (\\"the black day of the German Army\\"), not because of the ground lost to the advancing Allies, but because the morale of the German troops had sunk to the point where large numbers of troops began to capitulate. He recounted instances of retreating troops shouting \\"You're prolonging the war!\\" at officers who tried to rally them, and \\"Blackleg!\\" at reserves moving up.Blaxland, p. 181 Five German divisions had effectively been engulfed. Allied forces had pushed, on average, into enemy territory by the end of the day. The Canadians gained , Australians , the French , and the British .

The battle was widened on the north and the south of the initial attack, with the southern part of the battle (involving French forces) called Battle of Montdidier (). The infantry had outrun the supporting artillery, and the initial force of more than 500 tanks that played a large role in the Allied success was reduced to six battle-ready tanks within four days.Tanks from the National Archives of the United Kingdom. Retrieved 15 July 2006. On the Canadian front, congested roads and communication problems prevented the British 32nd Division being pushed forward rapidly enough to maintain the momentum of the advance.Blaxland, pp. 186‚Äì187 The Chipilly Spur was still in German hands. The Germans on the ridge commanded a wide field of fire to the south of the Somme, and poured devastating machine gun and artillery fire that kept the Australian Corps pinned down across the river at Hamel. The job of taking Chipilly Ridge was ultimately assigned to 3 battalions of American Doughboys from the 33rd U.S. Infantry Division. B.J. Omanson (2019), Before the Clangor of the Gun: The First World War Poetry of John Allan Wyeth, Monongahela Press, Morgantown, West Virginia. Pages 37-38. According to B.J. Omanson, \\"Their attack took place at 5:30 p.m.and, despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire pouring down on them from Chipilly Ridge, the Americans could not be driven back. They repeatedly pressed the assault until the northern half of the ridge and southern end of nearby Gressaire Wood were taken. Continuing the assault the following day, they took the rest of Gressaire Wood and by day's end were in possession of seven hundred German prisoners, thirty artillery pieces, one aircraft, and more than one hundred machine guns.\\" B.J. Omanson (2019), Before the Clangor of the Gun: The First World War Poetry of John Allan Wyeth, Monongahela Press, Morgantown, West Virginia. Pages 38-39. During the 33rd U.S. Division's assault on Chipilly Ridge, Corporal Jake Allex, a Serbian immigrant from Kosovo, took command of his platoon after all the other officers had been killed. Corporal Allex led them in an attack against a German machine gun nest, during which he personally killed five enemy soldiers and captured fifteen prisoners. For his actions at Chipilly Ridge, Corporal Allex became the second American soldier to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor during World War I. On 10 August, there were signs that the Germans were pulling out of the salient from Operation Michael. According to official reports, the Allies had captured nearly 50,000 prisoners and 500 guns by 27 August.Battle of Amiens, 27 August 1918 by Philip Gibbs from Source Records of the Great War, Vol. VI, ed. Charles F. Horne, National Alumni 1923. Even with the lessened armour the British drove into German positions by 13 August. Field Marshal Haig refused the request of Marshal Foch to continue the offensive, preferring instead to launch a fresh offensive by Byng's Third Army between the Ancre and Scarpe.Hart 2008 p. 364  Aftermath  A German 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. field gun captured during the course of the battle by the 33rd Australian Battalion The Battle of Amiens was a major turning point in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed movement on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier in 1918 had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions: the British Third Army, with no armoured support, had almost no effect on the line, while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. The British war correspondent Philip Gibbs noted Amiens' effect on the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, \\"the enemy...is on the defensive\\" and, \\"the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands that we are able to strike him at many different places.\\" Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, \\"the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. On our side the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly\\" and that, \\"there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation.\\" In popular culture On the night of August 8-9, 1918, as Doughboys from the 33rd U.S. Division were beginning their assault on Chipilly Ridge, American war poet Lt. John Allan Wyeth and Lieut. Thomas J. Cochrane were assigned to deliver sealed orders from Division HQ at Molliens-au-Bois to the Field Headquarters of all three battalions engaged in the attack. The location of each battalion was unknown, but they were believed to be along the northern bank of the Somme River, near the village of Sailly-le-Sec. In his 1928 sonnet sequence This Man's Army, Wyeth described the mission in detail in his six interlinked \\"Chipilly Ridge sonnets.\\"Omanson (2019), pages 36-49. According to Bradley J. Omanson, \\"Lt. Wyeth, as it happened, was a cultured man, a recent Princeton graduate in languages and literature, and he rendered his experiences of that night into an accomplished, highly original cycle of six linked sonnets - part of a much longer cycle of over fifty sonnets which covered the entirety of his service in the war. But it is this self-contained six-sonnet sequence in particular - describing one soldier's stumblings through the metaphoric valley of death - which selves most memorably into the nature of war.\\" Omanson (2019), page 39.

Wilson, was an update to the previous Humanist Manifesto (1933), and the second entry in the Humanist Manifesto series. It begins with a statement that the excesses of National Socialism and world war had made the first seem too optimistic, and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its seventeen-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version. Nevertheless, much of the optimism of the first remained, expressing hope that war and poverty would be eliminated. In addition to its absolute rejection of theism and deism, various political stances are supported, such as opposition to racism, opposition to weapons of mass destruction, support of human rights, a proposition of an international court, and the right to unrestricted abortion and contraception. Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more, and indeed the American Humanist Association's website encourages visitors to add their own name. A provision at the end stating that the signators do \\"not necessarily endorse every detail\\" of the document, but only its broad vision, no doubt helped many overcome reservations about attaching their name. One of the oft-quoted lines that comes from this manifesto is, \\"No deity will save us; we must save ourselves.\\" The Humanist Manifesto II first appeared in The Humanist September / October, 1973, when Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson were editor and editor emeritus, respectively.  Signatories  The 120 original signatories to the manifesto included the following:Humanist Manifesto II = United Kingdom = * A. J. Ayer * H. J.

The affair centred on journalist Maximilian Harden's accusations of homosexual conduct between the kaiser's close friend Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg-Hertefeld, and General Kuno, Graf von Moltke. Accusations and counter-accusations quickly multiplied, and the phrase \\"Liebenberg Round Table\\" came to be used for the homosexual circle around the Kaiser. The affair received wide publicity and is often considered the biggest domestic scandal of Imperial Germany. It led to one of the first major public discussions of homosexuality in Germany, comparable to the trial of Oscar Wilde in the United Kingdom. Causes The scandal was considered useful by opponents of Germany's foreign policies. Wilhelm II dismissed \\"Iron\\" Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his Realpolitik system of treaties and agreements in 1890, replacing Bismarck's clear rule with a muddle and his foreign policies with a confrontational, expansionist Weltpolitik. The anti-imperialist Eulenburg became the most prominent member of Wilhelm II's entourage, having been promoted from a member of the diplomatic corps to an ambassador.Steakley, James D. (revised 1989). \\"Iconography of a Scandal: Political Cartoons and the Eulenburg Affair in Wilhelmin Germany\\", Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay & Lesbian Past (1990), Duberman, et al., eds. New York: Meridian, New American Library, Penguin Books. .Tamagne, Florence A History of Homosexuality in Europe, 2003 page 17. Like many others, Bismarck noticed that the nature of the relationship between Wilhelm II and Eulenburg could \\"not be confided to paper\\" and felt, alongside those others, that even these activities in the private sphere were not to be exposed to the public. Beyond that, the Ausw√§rtiges Amt suffered what the British historian John C. G. R√∂hl called a \\"culture of intrigue\\" with German diplomats forever forming factions to plot against one another.R√∂hl, John The Kaiser and his Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 159 The two dominant factions in the early 20th century were the B√ºlow-Eulenburg clique, headed by Bernhard von B√ºlow and his close friend Eulenburg, who were rapidly eclipsing the faction headed by Friedrich von Holstein, the powerful director of the Political Department at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt.R√∂hl, John The Kaiser and his Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 159-160 Holstein had known Eulenburg since June 1886 and had once been his ally when the two had plotted against Bismarck in 1889-1890, but starting around 1894, Eulenburg and Holstein had begun to come into conflict with each other. The close friendship between Eulenburg and the Kaiser meant that Holstein tended to lose his arguments with Eulenburg. As a trump card to destroy his rival Eulenburg, Holstein had contacted Maximilian Harden to inform him that Eulenburg was a homosexual.R√∂hl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 69. Harden, imperialist head of the periodical Die Zukunft, felt similarly about the direction of German foreign policy, and in 1902 personally threatened to expose Eulenburg unless he retired from his ambassadorship in Vienna; Eulenburg did so, withdrawing from public life until 1906. Harden reaffirmed his threat after Germany at the Algeciras Conference of 1906 recognized Morocco as being within the French sphere of influence, in what was for Germany a major foreign policy fiasco, and Eulenburg responded by moving to Switzerland. In May 1906, Holstein sent Eulenburg an extremely insulting and rude letter alongside a challenge to fight a duel to the death.R√∂hl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 59. After Eulenburg declined to fight the duel, Holstein decided to destroy Eulenburg by attacking him in his Achilles heel, namely by exposing his homosexuality.R√∂hl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 69. Between 1906 and 1907, six military officers committed suicide after blackmail, while in the preceding three years, around twenty officers were convicted by courts-martial, all for homosexual acts. A Gardes du Corps officer was charged with homosexuality, an embarrassment because the elite Corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Wilhelm Graf von Hohenau, a blood relative to the kaiser. Worse than these sexual scandals, in Harden's eyes, was Eulenburg's decision to return to Germany and be admitted to the Order of the Black Eagle; he did not change his mind when Prince Friedrich Heinrich of Prussia declined to be admitted to the Order of Saint John because of his own homosexual proclivities. Outing Harden outed Eulenburg on April 27, 1907, confirming the identity he previously had parodied as \\"the Harpist\\" (Eulenburg), after outing \\"Sweetie\\" General Kuno Graf von Moltke in 1906. Wilhelm II, informed of the growing story, responded by requiring the resignation of three of fifteen prominent aristocrats, Hohenau, Moltke, and Count Johannes von Lynar, listed as homosexual by the Berlin vice squad; however, the actual list, not shown to Wilhelm II, contained several hundred names. Moltke's lawyer attempted to file criminal libel against Harden, but was dismissed and civil libel was suggested. Eulenburg denied any culpability and presented a self-accusation of violating the applicable Paragraph 175 to his district attorney who, as hoped and expected, cleared Eulenburg of all charges in July. Meanwhile, , manager of the Royal Theatre, von St√ºckradt, the crown prince's equerry, and Bernhard Prince von B√ºlow, imperial chancellor, were accused of having homosexual tendencies or engaging in homosexual activities. Moltke v. Harden This trial was held from October 23 to 29, 1907. Testifying against Moltke were Lily von Elbe, his former wife of nine years, a soldier named Bollhardt, and Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Elbe described the lack of conjugal relations, happening only on the first and second night of their marriage, Moltke's overly close friendship with Eulenburg with whom he was always spending too much time, and her ignorance of homosexuality. Elbe's testimony was sensational for the time and attracted much media attention as she spoke openly of her sexual needs and how difficult it was for her to be married to a man like Moltke who had no sexual interest in her, causing her to attack him several times in desperation.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 103. At the time, Germany had a very conservative culture where the existence of female sexuality was never spoken of in public, and Elbe's testimony was noteworthy for the first time where the subject of female sexuality was addressed in Germany.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 103. The revelation that his young wife had attacked General von Moltke without his defending himself was seen at the time as confirming that Moltke was not manly, as the expectation was that a Prussian officer and a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù would have beaten his wife if she struck him, which in turn confirmed the belief that Moltke was gay.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 103-104. Moltke's lawyers counterattacked using the subject of Elbe's sexuality, arguing that any woman who spoke openly of her sexuality was a deranged ‚Äúhysterical nymphomaniac‚Äù who could not be trusted.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 104. Bollhardt described attending champagne-filled parties at Lynar's villa at which he saw both Hohenau and Moltke. Hirschfeld, a prominent German sexologist who was himself homosexual, had observed the trial and testified that Moltke most certainly had a feminine side and was homosexual even if he had never committed sodomy. On October 29, the court found Moltke homosexual and Harden innocent of libel. However, the trial was voided on procedural grounds, and the state prosecutor decided to allow a criminal libel trial. B√ºlow v. Brand Cartoon satirising B√ºlow published October 1907 in Kladderadatsch. Title \\"On the maligning of B√ºlow\\", caption \\"Good Mohrchen, you would never be such a bad dog!\\". November 6, 1907. Adolf Brand, founder of the first homosexual periodical, Der Eigene (The Unique), had printed a pamphlet which described how B√ºlow had been blackmailed for his sexuality and had kissed and embraced Scheefer at male gatherings hosted by Eulenburg, and thus was morally obliged to publicly oppose Paragraph 175. Brand was found guilty of libel and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Harden v. Moltke December 18‚Äì25, 1907. Elbe, through a diagnosis of classical hysteria, and Hirschfeld, by retracting his earlier testimony, were discredited and Harden was convicted of libel and sentenced to four months imprisonment. Harden v. St√§dele April 21, 1908. Now motivated by political goals, morals, and vengeance, Harden set out to prove Eulenburg's homosexuality by having Anton St√§dele publish an article claiming Harden took hush money from Eulenburg. Harden then sued his accomplice for libel, St√§dele was found guilty and charged a hundred mark fine, repaid by Harden. During the trial, however, Georg Riedel and Jacob Ernst testified to having had sexual relations with Eulenburg. Eulenburg was charged with perjury and brought to trial on May 7, 1908. Two weeks later Harden's conviction was overturned and a second trial begun. Eulenburg June 29, 1908. After the first of 41 witnesses, including Ernst and ten witnesses who described watching Eulenburg through a keyhole in 1887, the trial was delayed because of Eulenburg's ill health. It was moved to his hospital bed on July 17, but was delayed again. The trial was postponed indefinitely in 1919; until that point Eulenburg had twice-yearly undergone a medical examination to determine if he was well enough to stand trial. Moltke v. Harden April, 1909. The trial date was originally set for November 24th, 1908, but was postponed. With little press, Harden was again convicted and fined six hundred marks plus the forty thousand marks of court costs, while Moltke was rehabilitated in the public eye. Effects The stress of the trials caused most participants to fall ill during 1908. In November 1908, the chief of the Military Secretariat [Dietrich von H√ºlsen-Haeseler] died of a heart attack while performing a pas seul dressed in a woman's ballet tutu for Wilhelm II and his hunting party, requiring further damage control in the form of a cover up. The Eulenburg affair has been held up as one example of homosexuality being used as a means to attain certain political goals. As Eulenburg's wife later commented, \\"They are striking at my husband, but their target is the kaiser.\\"Hirschfeld (1933) cited in Steakley (1989). Harden later told Hirschfeld that the affair was the greatest political mistake of his life. Like many later observers, attributing the affair as the root cause of World War I and the fall of the Second Reich, inevitable without Eulenburg's moderating influence.

It is the political party of former Philippine President Joseph Estrada. In the 1998 presidential election, it aligned itself with other political parties to form the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino or LAMMP (Struggle of the Patriotic Filipino Masses) coalition. History Originally named the Partido ng Masang Pilipino, the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) emanated from an organization which was an offshoot of the Economic Recovery Action Program (ERAP) organized by Mr. George S. Antonio in May 1990. The ERAP organization was formally launched on October 4, 1990 with 21 original members. The organization grew exponentially with the recruitment of members nationwide. It was then that the PMP was accredited as a political party with the objective of helping to uplift the lives of the Filipino people, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, through effective and efficient social and economic reforms. Its first campaign headquarters was located at the 4th floor of San Buena Building, Edsa corner Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City. On August 20, 1991, Partido ng Masang Pilipino was accredited as political party. In 1992, PMP took its first major political step by fielding then Senator Joseph Estrada as its vice- presidential candidate together with other local candidates. Under PMP, Mr. Estrada overwhelmingly won against his four opponents. The PMP also participated in the May 1995 election. In 1997, a permanent and fully operational headquarters was established at 409 Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City. In 1998, PMP was very much involved in the election with the candidacy of Estrada as president and other local candidates nationwide. PMP played a lead role in the establishment of the opposition coalition Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP), which also counted among its members the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) and Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC). The coalition fielded full slates for the national and local levels. Card-bearing members reached as high as 3.2 million nationwide. In the end, close to 11 million Filipinos overwhelmingly voted Joseph Estrada into office as the 13th President of the Republic of the Philippines. In 2001, PMP once again led the opposition coalition, with majority of its candidates elected into office, led by Dr. Luisa Ejercito Estrada who won a seat in the Senate. Two years later, in 2003, the name Partido ng Masang Pilipino was changed to Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino. In April 2004, the PMP agreed to enter into a coalition with the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) and Partido Demokratiko Pilipino- Lakas Bayan (PDP LABAN) to form the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP) and support the candidacy of Fernando Poe, Jr. for President of the Republic of the Philippines. In office Today, PMP occupies three Senate seats as a member of the minority floor, occupied by Estrada's wife, Luisa Ejercito Estrada, who won in 2001, his son, former San Juan suburb Mayor Jinggoy Estrada and long-time Estrada colleague veteran politician Juan Ponce Enrile, the last two winning in 2004. In the May 14, 2007 election, the party won three seats in the House of Representatives. Members of the Philippine House of Representatives are elected to serve three year terms.See 2007 Philippine general election. In the current 17th Congress the party current holds one senate seat held by Estrada's son JV Ejercito, due to most members switching sides to PDP‚ÄìLaban or UNA. In the news On January 18, 2008, Joseph Estrada's Partido ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) caused full-page advertisement in Metro Manila newspapers, blaming EDSA 2 of having \\"inflicted a dent on Philippine democracy\\". Its featured clippings questioned the constitutionality of the revolution. The published featured clippings were taken from Time, New York Times, Straits Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Asia Times Online, The Economist, and International Herald Tribune. Supreme Court justice Cecilia Mu√±oz Palma opined that EDSA 2 violated the 1987 Constitution. GMA NEWS.TV, Erap's PMP questions EDSA 2 constitutionality Alfredo Lim, on August 20, 2008, resigned as head of Joseph Estrada's Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (Partido ng Masang Pilipino ‚Äì PMP) following a PMP's executive committee resolution removing him as president of the party.

He is the long-time writing partner of Babaloo Mandel. Life and career Ganz was born in New York City, the son of Jean (n√©e Farber) and Irving Ganz, an arts supply executive.Filmreference.com Both of his parents were first-generation Americans born in New York. His mother's family is of Polish Jewish origin from the Bia≈Çystok area; his father's family is of Hungarian Jewish origin from Maramaros County, in what is today northern Romania. Ganz grew up in Queens, New York. He briefly attended Queens College, City University of New York, where he and his friend Mark Rothman wrote several comedic skits and shows for school productions. After Rothman's father Abe‚Äîa chauffeur who sometimes drove for The Mike Douglas Show‚Äîwas able to pass a spec script of theirs to Tony Randall, the two got a try-out writing gig on Randall's hit TV show The Odd Couple. However, the producers of the show would only pay for them to come to Los Angeles one- way. Ganz and Rothman dropped out of college and headed west to take the job. After being fired‚Äîcausing them to briefly live in their car and contemplate driving back across the country to New York‚Äîand then re-hired by producer Garry Marshall, the two became regular writers on the show; and Ganz eventually became Head Writer. That led to a career in Hollywood, writing for a string of television situation comedies. After writing for the short-lived sitcom Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers in 1974, Ganz moved on to writing for Happy Days and co-created two of its spin-off series, Laverne and Shirley and Joanie Loves Chachi. Ganz and Rothman's TV writing partnership dissolved after studio executives broke up the pair circa 1981. Ganz met his new writing partner, Babaloo Mandel, at The Comedy Store, shortly thereafter; and they made the jump to writing for films. In 1982, Ganz and Mandel teamed up with fellow Happy Days alumni Ron Howard‚Äîwho wanted to start directing‚Äîand Henry Winkler‚Äîwho wanted to move away from his image as Fonzie‚Äîto make their first film, the low-budget comedy Night Shift, which was also actor Michael Keaton's first film. Ganz's second film outing, Splash, launched the careers of Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah and earned Ganz a nomination for the 1984 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Ganz and Mandel went on to write several other films, four directed by Howard and one by Penny Marshall, alumna of Ganz's previous projects Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers and Laverne and Shirley. Five of their films have starred Billy Crystal, two have starred Tom Hanks, and two have starred Michael Keaton. Two of Ganz's films are about baseball; Ganz is a passionate fan of the New York Mets. Ganz and Mandel's film Parenthood was semi-autobiographical and highly praised by critics and led to two different spin-off television shows. Ganz and Mandel are also widely used as Hollywood script doctors, known for their reliability and fast turnaround time. Their screenwriting on several major films of the late 1990s and 2000s is uncredited, including Stuart Little and Stuart Little 2 as notable examples. In 2019, Ganz received the Writers Guild of America West‚Äôs 2019 Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement, which is presented to Guild members who have ‚Äúadvanced the literature of motion pictures and made outstanding contributions to the profession of the screenwriter.‚Äù Ganz lives in Los Angeles with his wife of more than 30 years, Jeanne Russo Ganz.People They have three children ‚Äî Scott, Allie, and Simon ‚Äî all working in entertainment.
